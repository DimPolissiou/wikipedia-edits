He was born on the family farm in the [[Catskill Mountains]], near [[Roxbury, New York|Roxbury]] in [[Delaware County, New York]]. As a child he spent many hours on the slopes of [[Old Clump Mountain]], looking off to the east and the higher peaks of the Catskills, especially [[Slide Mountain (Ulster County, New York)|Slide Mountain]], which he would later write about. As he labored on the family farm he was captivated by the return of the birds each spring and other wildlife around the family farm including frogs and bumblebees. In his later years he credited his life as a farm boy for his subsequent love of nature and feeling of kinship with all rural things.<ref name=\"Our Friend\">{{cite book|author=Clara Barrus|title=Our Friend John Burroughs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgYIAQAAIAAJ|year=1914|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref>\n\nDuring his teen years Burroughs showed a keen interest in learning.<ref>{{cite book | last=Barrus | first=Clara | title= The Life and Letters of John Burroughs | publisher=Russell & Russell |location=New York | pages=28 | year=1968}}</ref> Among Burroughs's classmates was future financier [[Jay Gould]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Renehan |first=Edward J., Jr. |title= Dark Genius of Wall Street: The Misunderstood Life of Jay Gould, King of the Robber Barons |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |pages=17 |year=2005}}</ref> Burroughs' father believed the basic education provided by the local school was enough and refused to support the young Burroughs when he asked for money to pay for the books or the higher education he wanted. At the age of 17 Burroughs left home to earn the money he needed for college by teaching at a school in [[Olive, New York]].\n\nFrom 1854 to 1856 Burroughs alternated periods of teaching with periods of study at higher education institutions including Cooperstown Seminary; he left the Seminary and completed his studies in 1856. He continued to teach until 1863. In 1857 Burroughs left a teaching position in the small village of [[Buffalo Grove, Ogle County, Illinois|Buffalo Grove]] in [[Illinois]] to seek employment closer to home, drawn back by \"the girl I left behind me.\"<ref name=\"Our Friend\"/> On September 12, 1857, Burroughs married Ursula North (1836\u20131917). Burroughs later became an atheist with an inclination towards [[pantheism]].<ref>Dan Barker (2011). The Good Atheist: Living a Purpose-Filled Life Without God. Ulysses Press. p. 170. {{ISBN|9781569758465}}. An essayist who popularized the American romantic view of nature, Burroughs wrote, \u201cWhen I look up at the starry heavens at night and reflect upon what is it that I really see there, I am constrained to say, 'There is no God.'\" In his 1910 journal, he wrote: \"Joy in the universe, and keen curiosity about it all-that has been my religion.\"</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Edison Burroughs Ford.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Burroughs poses with [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Henry Ford]] at Edison's home in Ft. Myers, Florida, 1914.]]\n\nBurroughs had his first break as a writer in the summer of 1860 when the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', then a fairly new publication, accepted his essay ''Expression''. Editor [[James Russell Lowell]] found the essay so similar to Emerson's work that he initially thought Burroughs had [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] his longtime acquaintance. ''Poole's Index'' and ''Hill's Rhetoric'', both periodical indexes, even credited Emerson as the author of the essay.<ref>{{cite book | last=Barrus | first=Clara | title= The Life and Letters of John Burroughs | publisher=Russell & Russell | location=New York | page=52 | year=1968}}</ref>\n\nIn 1864, Burroughs accepted a position as a clerk at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]]; he would eventually become a federal bank examiner, continuing in that profession into the 1880s. All the while, he continued to publish essays, and grew interested in the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]]. Burroughs met Whitman in Washington, DC in November 1863, and the two became close friends.<ref>{{cite book | last=Peck | first=Garrett | title=Walt Whitman in Washington, D.C.: The Civil War and America's Great Poet | year=2015 | publisher=The History Press | location=Charleston, SC | isbn=978-1626199736 | pages=83\u201385}}</ref>\n\nWhitman encouraged Burroughs to develop his nature writing as well as his philosophical and literary essays. In 1867, Burroughs published ''Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person'', the first biography and critical work on the poet, which was extensively (and anonymously) revised and edited by Whitman himself before publication.<ref>{{cite book | last=Peck | first=Garrett | title=Walt Whitman in Washington, D.C.: The Civil War and America's Great Poet | year=2015 | publisher=The History Press | location=Charleston, SC | isbn=978-1626199736 | page=149}}</ref> Four years later, the Boston house of [[Hurd & Houghton]] published Burroughs's first collection of nature essays, ''Wake-Robin''.\n\n[[File:Slabsides.jpg|A 2005 photograph of [[Slabsides]], Burroughs's cabin in West Park, NY; the cabin was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1968.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=791&ResourceType=Building | title=Slabsides (John Burroughs cabin) | date=September 11, 2007 | work=National Historic Landmark listing | publisher=National Park Service | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401132245/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=791&ResourceType=Building | archivedate=April 1, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>|thumb|200px|right]]\n\nIn January 1873, Burroughs left Washington for New York. The next year he bought a {{convert|9|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm in West Park, NY (now part of the [[Esopus, New York|Town of Esopus]]) where he built his [[Riverby]] estate. There he grew various crops before eventually focusing on [[table grape]]s.  He continued to write, and continued as a federal bank examiner for several more years. In 1895 Burroughs bought additional land near Riverby where he and son Julian constructed an [[Adirondack Architecture|Adirondack-style]] cabin that he called \"[[Slabsides]]\". At Slabsides he wrote, grew celery, and entertained visitors, including students from local [[Vassar College]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  After the turn of the 20th century, Burroughs renovated an old farmhouse near his birthplace and called it \"[[Woodchuck Lodge]].\" This became his summer residence until his death.\n\nBurroughs accompanied many personalities of the time in his later years, including [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[John Muir]], [[Henry Ford]] (who gave him an automobile, one of the first in the [[Hudson Valley]]), [[Harvey Firestone]], and [[Thomas Edison]]. In 1899, he participated in [[E. H. Harriman]]'s [[Harriman Alaska Expedition|expedition to Alaska]].\n\nAccording to Ford, \"John Burroughs, Edison, and I with Harvey S. Firestone made several vagabond trips together.  We went in motor caravans and slept under canvas.\"  Once we gypsied through the Adirondacks and again through the Alleghenies, heading southward.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ford |first1=Henry |title=My Life and Work |date=2019 |location=Columbia |isbn=9781545549117 |pages=116}}</ref>\n\nIn 1901, Burroughs met an admirer, Clara Barrus (1864\u20131931). She was a physician with the state psychiatric hospital in Middletown, N.Y. Clara was 37 and nearly half his age. She was the great love of his life<ref>''Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia'', ed. J.R. LeMaster, p. 90: \"Burroughs and Ursula\", Carmine Sarracino, pub. Routledge, 1998</ref> and ultimately his [[literary executor|literary executrix]]. She moved into his house after Ursula died in 1917. She published ''Whitman and Burroughs: Comrades'' in 1931, relying on firsthand accounts and letters to documents Burroughs' friendship with poet Walt Whitman.\n\n===Nature fakers controversy===\n{{further|Nature fakers controversy}}\n\nIn 1903, after publishing an article entitled \"Real and Sham Natural History\" in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', Burroughs began a widely publicized literary debate known as the [[nature fakers controversy]].  Attacking popular writers of the day such as [[Ernest Thompson Seton]], [[Charles G. D. Roberts]] and [[William J. Long]] for their fantastical representations of wildlife, he also denounced the booming genre of \"naturalistic\" animal stories as \"[[yellow journalism]] of the woods\".  The controversy lasted for four years and involved American environmental and political figures of the day, including President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who was friends with Burroughs.<ref>Carson, Gerald. February 1971. \"[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1971/2/1971_2_60.shtml T.R. and the 'nature fakers']\" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120192537/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1971/2/1971_2_60.shtml |date=November 20, 2008 }}. ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''. Volume 22, Issue 2.</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nMany of Burroughs' essays first appeared in popular magazines. He is best known for his observations on birds, flowers and rural scenes, but his essay topics also range to religion, philosophy, and literature. Burroughs was a staunch defender of [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], but somewhat critical of [[Henry David Thoreau]], even while praising many of Thoreau's qualities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} His achievements as a writer were confirmed by his election as a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/11/19/100987174.pdf  \"Academy Honors John Burroughs; Naturalist Praised by Bliss Perry and Hamlin Garland at Memorial Meeting,\"] ''New York Times.''

In the late 1880s, in the essay \"The Heart of the Southern Catskills,\" he chronicled an ascent of Slide Mountain, the highest peak of the Catskills range. Speaking of the view from the summit, he wrote: \"The works of man dwindle, and the original features of the huge globe come out. Every single object or point is dwarfed; the valley of the Hudson is only a wrinkle in the earth's surface. You discover with a feeling of surprise that the great thing is the earth itself, which stretches away on every hand so far beyond your ken.\" The first sentence of this quote is now on a plaque commemorating Burroughs at the mountain's summit, on a rock outcrop known as Burroughs Ledge. Slide and neighboring ''Cornell'' and ''Wittenberg'' mountains, which he also climbed, have been collectively named the Burroughs Range.\n\n[[File:JohnBurroughsFishing.JPG|thumb|150px|1906 photograph of Burroughs, from ''Camping & Tramping with Roosevelt''.]]\n\nOther Catskill essays told of [[fly fishing]] for [[trout]], of hikes over Peekamoose Mountain and Mill Brook Ridge, and of rafting down the East Branch of the [[Delaware River]]. It is for these that he is still celebrated in the region today, and chiefly known, although he traveled extensively and wrote about other regions and countries, as well as commenting on natural-science controversies of the day such as the theory of [[natural selection]].<ref>New York Times December 17, 1922: John Burroughs' last book by Hildegarde Hawthorne.</ref> He entertained philosophical and literary questions, and wrote another book about Whitman in 1896, four years after the poet's death.\n\n==Fishing==\nFrom his youth, Burroughs was an avid [[fly fishing|fly fisherman]] and known among Catskill anglers.<ref>{{cite book | last=Karas | first=Nick | title=Brook Trout: a Thorough Look At North America's Great Native Trout \u2013 its History, Biology and Angling Possibilities | publisher=Lyons & Burford | location=New York | year=1997 | pages=199\u2013201 | isbn=978-1-55821-479-8}}</ref> Although he never wrote any purely fishing books, he did contribute some notable fishing essays to angling literature.  Most notable of these was ''Speckled Trout'', which appeared in the ''Atlantic Monthly'' in October 1870 and was later published in ''In The Catskills.'' In his essay  ''Speckled Trout'' Burroughs highlights his experiences as an angler and celebrates the trout, streams and lakes of the Catskills.<ref>{{cite book | last=Burroughs | first=John | title=In the Catskills | url=https://archive.org/details/incatskillsselec00burriala | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | location=New York | pages=[https://archive.org/details/incatskillsselec00burriala/page/187 187\u2013219] | year=1910}}</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:John Burrough Boyhood rock.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Burroughs gravesite today, Boyhood Rock with plaque on left]]\n\nBurroughs enjoyed good physical and mental health during his later years until only a few months before his death when he began to experience lapses in memory and show general signs of advanced age including declining heart function. In February 1921 Burroughs underwent an operation to remove an abscess from his chest. Following this operation, his health steadily declined.

He was born on the family farm in the [[Catskill Mountains]], near [[Roxbury, New York|Roxbury]] in [[Delaware County, New York]]. As a child he spent many hours on the slopes of [[Old Clump Mountain]], looking off to the east and the higher peaks of the Catskills, especially [[Slide Mountain (Ulster County, New York)|Slide Mountain]], which he would later write about. As he labored on the family farm he was captivated by the return of the birds each spring and other wildlife around the family farm including frogs and bumblebees. In his later years he credited his life as a farm boy for his subsequent love of nature and feeling of kinship with all rural things.<ref name=\"Our Friend\">{{cite book|author=Clara Barrus|title=Our Friend John Burroughs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OgYIAQAAIAAJ|year=1914|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref>\n\nDuring his teen years Burroughs showed a keen interest in learning.<ref>{{cite book | last=Barrus | first=Clara | title= The Life and Letters of John Burroughs | publisher=Russell & Russell |location=New York | pages=28 | year=1968}}</ref> Among Burroughs's classmates was future financier [[Jay Gould]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Renehan |first=Edward J., Jr. |title= Dark Genius of Wall Street: The Misunderstood Life of Jay Gould, King of the Robber Barons |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |pages=17 |year=2005}}</ref> Burroughs' father believed the basic education provided by the local school was enough and refused to support the young Burroughs when he asked for money to pay for the books or the higher education he wanted. At the age of 17 Burroughs left home to earn the money he needed for college by teaching at a school in [[Olive, New York]].\n\nFrom 1854 to 1856 Burroughs alternated periods of teaching with periods of study at higher education institutions including Cooperstown Seminary; he left the Seminary and completed his studies in 1856. He continued to teach until 1863. In 1857 Burroughs left a teaching position in the small village of [[Buffalo Grove, Ogle County, Illinois|Buffalo Grove]] in [[Illinois]] to seek employment closer to home, drawn back by \"the girl I left behind me.\"<ref name=\"Our Friend\"/> On September 12, 1857, Burroughs married Ursula North (1836\u20131917). Burroughs later became an atheist with an inclination towards pantheism.<ref>Dan Barker (2011). The Good Atheist: Living a Purpose-Filled Life Without God. Ulysses Press. p. 170. {{ISBN|9781569758465}}. An essayist who popularized the American romantic view of nature, Burroughs wrote, \u201cWhen I look up at the starry heavens at night and reflect upon what is it that I really see there, I am constrained to say, 'There is no God.'\" In his 1910 journal, he wrote: \"Joy in the universe, and keen curiosity about it all-that has been my religion.\"</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Edison Burroughs Ford.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Burroughs poses with [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Henry Ford]] at Edison's home in Ft. Myers, Florida, 1914.]]\n\nBurroughs had his first break as a writer in the summer of 1860 when the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', then a fairly new publication, accepted his essay ''Expression''. Editor [[James Russell Lowell]] found the essay so similar to Emerson's work that he initially thought Burroughs had [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] his longtime acquaintance. ''Poole's Index'' and ''Hill's Rhetoric'', both periodical indexes, even credited Emerson as the author of the essay.<ref>{{cite book | last=Barrus | first=Clara | title= The Life and Letters of John Burroughs | publisher=Russell & Russell | location=New York | page=52 | year=1968}}</ref>\n\nIn 1864, Burroughs accepted a position as a clerk at the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]]; he would eventually become a federal bank examiner, continuing in that profession into the 1880s. All the while, he continued to publish essays, and grew interested in the poetry of [[Walt Whitman]]. Burroughs met Whitman in Washington, DC in November 1863, and the two became close friends.<ref>{{cite book | last=Peck | first=Garrett | title=Walt Whitman in Washington, D.C.: The Civil War and America's Great Poet | year=2015 | publisher=The History Press | location=Charleston, SC | isbn=978-1626199736 | pages=83\u201385}}</ref>\n\nWhitman encouraged Burroughs to develop his nature writing as well as his philosophical and literary essays. In 1867, Burroughs published ''Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person'', the first biography and critical work on the poet, which was extensively (and anonymously) revised and edited by Whitman himself before publication.<ref>{{cite book | last=Peck | first=Garrett | title=Walt Whitman in Washington, D.C.: The Civil War and America's Great Poet | year=2015 | publisher=The History Press | location=Charleston, SC | isbn=978-1626199736 | page=149}}</ref> Four years later, the Boston house of [[Hurd & Houghton]] published Burroughs's first collection of nature essays, ''Wake-Robin''.\n\n[[File:Slabsides.jpg|A 2005 photograph of [[Slabsides]], Burroughs's cabin in West Park, NY; the cabin was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1968.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=791&ResourceType=Building | title=Slabsides (John Burroughs cabin) | date=September 11, 2007 | work=National Historic Landmark listing | publisher=National Park Service | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401132245/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=791&ResourceType=Building | archivedate=April 1, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>|thumb|200px|right]]\n\nIn January 1873, Burroughs left Washington for New York. The next year he bought a {{convert|9|acre|ha|adj=on}} farm in West Park, NY (now part of the [[Esopus, New York|Town of Esopus]]) where he built his [[Riverby]] estate. There he grew various crops before eventually focusing on [[table grape]]s.  He continued to write, and continued as a federal bank examiner for several more years. In 1895 Burroughs bought additional land near Riverby where he and son Julian constructed an [[Adirondack Architecture|Adirondack-style]] cabin that he called \"[[Slabsides]]\". At Slabsides he wrote, grew celery, and entertained visitors, including students from local [[Vassar College]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}  After the turn of the 20th century, Burroughs renovated an old farmhouse near his birthplace and called it \"[[Woodchuck Lodge]].\" This became his summer residence until his death.\n\nBurroughs accompanied many personalities of the time in his later years, including [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[John Muir]], [[Henry Ford]] (who gave him an automobile, one of the first in the [[Hudson Valley]]), [[Harvey Firestone]], and [[Thomas Edison]]. In 1899, he participated in [[E. H. Harriman]]'s [[Harriman Alaska Expedition|expedition to Alaska]].\n\nAccording to Ford, \"John Burroughs, Edison, and I with Harvey S. Firestone made several vagabond trips together.  We went in motor caravans and slept under canvas.\"  Once we gypsied through the Adirondacks and again through the Alleghenies, heading southward.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ford |first1=Henry |title=My Life and Work |date=2019 |location=Columbia |isbn=9781545549117 |pages=116}}</ref>\n\nIn 1901, Burroughs met an admirer, Clara Barrus (1864\u20131931). She was a physician with the state psychiatric hospital in Middletown, N.Y. Clara was 37 and nearly half his age. She was the great love of his life<ref>''Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia'', ed. J.R. LeMaster, p. 90: \"Burroughs and Ursula\", Carmine Sarracino, pub. Routledge, 1998</ref> and ultimately his [[literary executor|literary executrix]]. She moved into his house after Ursula died in 1917. She published ''Whitman and Burroughs: Comrades'' in 1931, relying on firsthand accounts and letters to documents Burroughs' friendship with poet Walt Whitman.\n\n===Nature fakers controversy===\n{{further|Nature fakers controversy}}\n\nIn 1903, after publishing an article entitled \"Real and Sham Natural History\" in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', Burroughs began a widely publicized literary debate known as the [[nature fakers controversy]].  Attacking popular writers of the day such as [[Ernest Thompson Seton]], [[Charles G. D. Roberts]] and [[William J. Long]] for their fantastical representations of wildlife, he also denounced the booming genre of \"naturalistic\" animal stories as \"[[yellow journalism]] of the woods\".  The controversy lasted for four years and involved American environmental and political figures of the day, including President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who was friends with Burroughs.<ref>Carson, Gerald. February 1971. \"[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1971/2/1971_2_60.shtml T.R. and the 'nature fakers']\" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120192537/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1971/2/1971_2_60.shtml |date=November 20, 2008 }}. ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''. Volume 22, Issue 2.</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nMany of Burroughs' essays first appeared in popular magazines. He is best known for his observations on birds, flowers and rural scenes, but his essay topics also range to religion, philosophy, and literature. Burroughs was a staunch defender of [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], but somewhat critical of [[Henry David Thoreau]], even while praising many of Thoreau's qualities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} His achievements as a writer were confirmed by his election as a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]].<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/11/19/100987174.pdf  \"Academy Honors John Burroughs; Naturalist Praised by Bliss Perry and Hamlin Garland at Memorial Meeting,\"] ''New York Times.''

In the late 1880s, in the essay \"The Heart of the Southern Catskills,\" he chronicled an ascent of Slide Mountain, the highest peak of the Catskills range. Speaking of the view from the summit, he wrote: \"The works of man dwindle, and the original features of the huge globe come out. Every single object or point is dwarfed; the valley of the Hudson is only a wrinkle in the earth's surface. You discover with a feeling of surprise that the great thing is the earth itself, which stretches away on every hand so far beyond your ken.\" The first sentence of this quote is now on a plaque commemorating Burroughs at the mountain's summit, on a rock outcrop known as Burroughs Ledge. Slide and neighboring ''Cornell'' and ''Wittenberg'' mountains, which he also climbed, have been collectively named the Burroughs Range.\n\n[[File:JohnBurroughsFishing.JPG|thumb|150px|1906 photograph of Burroughs, from ''Camping & Tramping with Roosevelt''.]]\n\nOther Catskill essays told of [[fly fishing]] for [[trout]], of hikes over Peekamoose Mountain and Mill Brook Ridge, and of rafting down the East Branch of the [[Delaware River]]. It is for these that he is still celebrated in the region today, and chiefly known, although he traveled extensively and wrote about other regions and countries, as well as commenting on natural-science controversies of the day such as the theory of [[natural selection]].<ref>New York Times December 17, 1922: John Burroughs' last book by Hildegarde Hawthorne.</ref> He entertained philosophical and literary questions, and wrote another book about Whitman in 1896, four years after the poet's death.\n\n==Fishing==\nFrom his youth, Burroughs was an avid [[fly fishing|fly fisherman]] and known among Catskill anglers.<ref>{{cite book | last=Karas | first=Nick | title=Brook Trout: a Thorough Look At North America's Great Native Trout \u2013 its History, Biology and Angling Possibilities | publisher=Lyons & Burford | location=New York | year=1997 | pages=199\u2013201 | isbn=978-1-55821-479-8}}</ref> Although he never wrote any purely fishing books, he did contribute some notable fishing essays to angling literature.  Most notable of these was ''Speckled Trout'', which appeared in the ''Atlantic Monthly'' in October 1870 and was later published in ''In The Catskills.'' In his essay  ''Speckled Trout'' Burroughs highlights his experiences as an angler and celebrates the trout, streams and lakes of the Catskills.<ref>{{cite book | last=Burroughs | first=John | title=In the Catskills | url=https://archive.org/details/incatskillsselec00burriala | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company | location=New York | pages=[https://archive.org/details/incatskillsselec00burriala/page/187 187\u2013219] | year=1910}}</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:John Burrough Boyhood rock.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Burroughs gravesite today, Boyhood Rock with plaque on left]]\n\nBurroughs enjoyed good physical and mental health during his later years until only a few months before his death when he began to experience lapses in memory and show general signs of advanced age including declining heart function. In February 1921 Burroughs underwent an operation to remove an abscess from his chest. Following this operation, his health steadily declined. Burroughs died on March 29, 1921 while on a train near [[Kingsville, Ohio]].<ref name=obit>{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=John Burroughs Dies On A Train.

In his final season at the club, [[1980-81 in English football|1980\u201381]], he made ten league appearances and scored one goal before he was sold to [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]]. He played against Hartlepool in Halifax's visit to [[Victoria Park, Hartlepool|Victoria Park]] later in the season.<ref>[http://www.inthemadcrowd.co.uk/cgi-bin/itmc_view_match.asp?oid=2891 In The Mad Crowd \u2013 a Hartlepool United Resource] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001081730/http://www.inthemadcrowd.co.uk/cgi-bin/itmc_view_match.asp?oid=2891 |date=1 October 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Halifax Town===\nAt Halifax, Ayre made 63 league appearances and scored five goals in his first spell at [[The Shay]].\n\n===Mansfield Town===\nThe summer of 1982 saw Ayre move again, this time to [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]], then managed by [[Stuart Boam]]. He spent two seasons with ''the Stags'', making 67 league appearances and scoring seven goals. He scored a headed goal on his first-team debut in a [[Football League Trophy]] tie at [[Field Mill]].<ref>[http://www.stagsnet.net/vintage/reports/billyayre.htm \"Billy Ayre sadly passes away\"] \u2013 Stags.net</ref>\n\nThe following season, 1983\u201384, Ayre found himself acting as caretaker-manager after the sacking of Boam. [[Ian Greaves]] was eventually appointed as the new manager, and Ayre was released on a free transfer.<ref>[https://www.chad.co.uk/sport/football/mansfield-town/friday-s-former-stags-billy-ayre-1-8088926 \"Friday's Former Stags: Billy Ayre\"] - Chad.co.uk, 26 August 2016</ref>\n\n===Halifax Town===\nAyre re-joined Halifax for a second spell in 1984. In two years, he made 32 league appearances and scored two goals. He brought his playing career to a close with the club in 1986.<ref>{{NeilBrownPlayers|player1/billyayre}}</ref> On 5 August 1987, Halifax played a benefit match for Ayre against [[Halifax RLFC]]. At this point, he was the club's manager.\n\n==Managerial career==\n\n===Halifax===\nIn October 1984, Ayre took over as [[caretaker-manager]] of Halifax for less than a month. Mick Jones, who is the [[Godparent|godfather]] to Ayre's two children, was installed on 10 November.\n\nIn December 1986, Ayre became manager of Halifax again, this time on a full-time basis.<ref>[http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/viewarticle.aspx?sectionid=701&articleid=314093 \"Billy kept club going \u2013 Jack\"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} \u2013 ''Halifax Courier''</ref> (He was also [[managing director]] of the club.)<ref name=gazette2015/> Three years later, in April of the [[1989-90 in English football|1989\u201390]] season, he resigned,<ref name=gazette2015>[https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/sport/football/blackpool-fc/25-years-on-there-was-never-a-dull-moment-with-billy-ayre-1-7602436 \"25 years on: \"There was never a dull moment with Billy Ayre\"] - ''Blackpool Gazette'', 2 December 2015</ref> having failed to get them out of the league's [[Football League Fourth Division|basement division]].\n\n===Blackpool===\n[[File:Billy Ayre (1992).jpg|thumb|left|Ayre in a [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] shirt at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in May 1992.]]\n\nA few days after departing Halifax, Ayre joined [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] as assistant to manager [[Jimmy Mullen (footballer, born 1952)|Jimmy Mullen]]. After Mullen's departure at the end of the month, Ayre worked alongside caretaker-manager [[Tom White (footballer, born 1939)|Tom White]]. [[Graham Carr]] was installed during the close season, and he kept Ayre on as assistant. When Carr himself was sacked in November 1990, Ayre was promoted in his place.<ref name=gazette2015/><ref>[http://www.blackpoolfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10432~63119,00.html The History of Blackpool Football Club] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022033216/http://www.blackpoolfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/History/0,,10432~63119,00.html |date=22 October 2007 }} \u2013 BlackpoolFC.co.uk</ref> His first game in charge was a draw at [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] on 1 December 1990. As [[Roy Calley]] wrote in his 1992 book, ''Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887\u20131992'', Ayre, almost unknown outside the lower leagues, was \"greeted reservedly by Blackpool supporters, yet in the space of two years [had] become the club's most popular \u2013 and certainly most successful \u2013 boss since [[Stan Mortensen]]\". On matchdays, he wore the number 15 Blackpool shirt, in the days when only three substitutes (numbers 12 to 14) were permitted for league games.\n\nWhen Carr left, Blackpool were lying in eighteenth position in the Division Four table; six months later, however, the team had qualified for the play-offs after losing only five of their remaining thirty games. Between 10 November 1990 and 19 November 1991 two new (and still existing) club records were set: fifteen consecutive home League wins in what turned out to be a twenty-four-game unbeaten run at [[Bloomfield Road]]. (The match that set the ball rolling, a 4\u20132 victory over [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]], was under the guidance of Carr.) Their good fortune came undone at the last hurdle, however, when they lost in a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] to [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] in the final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] and remained in the Fourth Division for another season. (In an interview at the final whistle, Ayre said, \"I've never had a worse moment in my life, never mind football.\")<ref>''[[The Seasiders (DVD)|The Seasiders]]''</ref>\n\nAyre was able to keep largely the same team together and guided them back to Wembley the following [[Blackpool F.C. season 1991-92#Play-offs|1991\u201392]] season, in which they finally gained promotion after another, more successful penalties experience. [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] were the unlucky team on this occasion. Blackpool had booked their place in the new [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. Ayre dedicated the victory to his parents, who died the previous year.<ref>''Blackpool Football Club: Classic Matches'' DVD</ref>\n\nThe [[1992-93 in English football|following season]] saw ''the Seasiders'' finish in a lowly eighteenth position after winning only twelve of their forty-six games.\n\nOn the final day of the [[1993-94 in English football|1993\u201394]] season, Blackpool avoided relegation by a single point by virtue of beating [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] 4\u20131 at Bloomfield Road. Ayre was sacked in June by then-chairman [[Owen Oyston]] after ''the Seasiders'' failed to impress at their new level. He was succeeded by [[Sam Allardyce]]. Ayre's league record in his three-and-a-half years at Bloomfield Road: 191 games, 77 wins, 70 draws, 44 losses.<ref>[http://www.soccerbase.com/managers2.sd?managerid=167 Ayre's managerial stats at Soccerbase]</ref> At the time of his departure, Ayre was the sixth-longest-serving Blackpool manager in terms of Football League games in charge.\n\nAyre achieved not only promotion but subsequently survival with very little financial backing from Oyston.<ref>Calley, Roy (1992). ''Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887\u20131992'', Breedon Books Sport {{ISBN|1-873626-07-X}}</ref> After a defeat at his former club, Hartlepool United, on 2 October 1992, Ayre confronted the travelling support, who had been shouting to Ayre to spend some money. He explained how his access to finances were tied by his chairman. During this period, players such as [[Alan Wright]], [[Paul Groves (footballer)|Paul Groves]], and, most notably, [[Trevor Sinclair]] all left the club for bigger and better things. Despite this, Ayre's sides battled, grafted, and occasionally shocked sides with far greater resources at their disposal. As demonstrated in the retrospective DVD ''[[The Seasiders (DVD)|The Seasiders]]'', a feature of the Geordie's time at Bloomfield Road was his \"ticker-tape entrance\" in games at Bloomfield Road \u2013 fans throwing paper aloft whilst Ayre made his way across to the dugout on the east side of the ground. He would acknowledge the fans, then clench his fists, urging ''the Seasiders''{{'}} faithful to back his team.\n\n===Scarborough===\nAyre's next stop was Scarborough, where he arrived in August [[1994-95 in English football|1994]], some twenty years after playing for the Yorkshiremen. His reign at the [[McCain Stadium]] lasted just four months, after he was sacked for failing to turn around the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] strugglers.\n\n===Southport===\nA short-but-successful stint at [[non-League]] [[Southport F.C.|Southport]] followed during the 1994\u201395 season. Ayre had guided ''the Sandgrounders'' to a third-placed finishing position.\n\n===Swansea City===\nIn March 1996, Ayre was asked by new [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea City]] boss [[Jan M\u00f8lby]] to be his assistant, but the duo arrived too late to prevent ''the Swans'' from sliding into Division Three. They reached the play-off final a year later, but a last-minute goal saw them lose to [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] and miss out on promotion. Ayre and M\u00f8lby were both sacked soon after the disappointment.<ref>[http://www.4thegame.com/news/story/34992/MOLBY+HITS+OUT+AFTER+SWANSEA+DISMISSAL.html \"Molby hits out after Swansea dismissal\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020111906/http://www.4thegame.com/news/story/34992/MOLBY+HITS+OUT+AFTER+SWANSEA+DISMISSAL.html |date=20 October 2007 }} \u2013 4thgame.com</ref>\n\n===Cardiff City===\nAyre then assisted [[Frank Burrows]] at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] and helped them to promotion to Division Two in [[1998-99 in English football|1998\u201399]].\n\nAfter a month-long break while having a benign [[tumor]] removed, Ayre was installed to the manager's seat at Cardiff when Burrows resigned in January 2000.<ref>[http://www.cardiffcity.com/reports99-2000/060500rep.htm Cardiff City 1\u20130 Bristol Rovers] \u2013 CardiffCity.com</ref> \"This came as a complete shock,\" he said at the time. \"I was on the motorway driving back to [[South Wales]] when the chairman rang me.

I'm still stunned about what has happened, but we have to revitalise and rejuvenate the team quickly. Frank Burrows brought me to Cardiff and did everything within his power for the club. But we have to look forward, we have to work quickly. That's what Frank would want.\"\n\nRegarding the tumor, Ayre said: \"That wasn't something which bothered me too much. That may sound strange, but it was outside my control, so I got on with things. Now the Cardiff City job has been given to me, albeit temporarily for now, and that ''is'' within my control. I haven't spoken to Frank yet, because he has gone away. But I will talk to him soon.\"<ref name=\"CCFC\"/>\n\n[[File:Ayre at the Millennium.jpg|thumb|Ayre (centre) in 2001 on 26 May 2001 at the [[Millennium Stadium]], [[Cardiff]], just under a year before his death]]\n\nAlso regarding his tumor, he stated: \"I'm not at all frightened. I know the risks. The odds of people not even surviving the treatment are 20\u20131, but that doesn't bother me. I've backed a few 20\u20131 winners in my time. One in four people get cancer, and I'm pleased it's me and not somebody else in my family. I'd rather take it, because I think I can deal with it.\"<ref>[http://cardiffcity.rivals.net/default.asp?sid=927&p=2&stid=8253261 \"Billy Ayre loses his brave battle against cancer\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709041609/http://cardiffcity.rivals.net/default.asp?sid=927 |date=9 July 2007 }} \u2013 CCFCSleepingGiant.com</ref>\n\nAyre stayed on beyond the end of the season despite ''the Bluebirds'' falling back into Division Three. He was demoted to assistant manager when owner [[Sam Hammam]] installed [[Bobby Gould]] in August 2000.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/sport/2000/0808/soccer13.html \"Gould takes Cardiff job\"] \u2013 RTE.ie</ref> His services were disposed of completely two months later when [[Alan Cork]] was put in charge of first-team affairs and Gould was appointed general manager.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/953216.stm \"Ayre sacked by Cardiff\"] \u2013 BBC Sport</ref>\n\n===Bury===\nAyre's final job in football came within weeks of leaving Cardiff. He joined Division Two side [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as assistant to [[Andy Preece]], who played for him at [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]], but in the spring of 2001 it was found that the [[lymph node]] cancer he had initially been diagnosed with in 1995 had returned.<ref>[http://www.halifaxcourier.co.uk/ViewArticle.aspx?sectionid=701&articleid=314092 \"Billy battles with cancer\"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} \u2013 ''Halifax Courier'', 25 June 2001</ref> [[Graham Barrow]] was given the temporary job of assistant manager while Ayre received treatment for his illness, and he appeared to be recovering; however, he suffered a setback in early 2002 and was admitted to Clatterbridge Hospital in [[Bebington]], Merseyside.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Grave of William Ayre.jpg|thumb|upright|Ayre's grave at [[St Cuthbert's Church, Halsall|St Cuthbert's Churchyard]] in [[Halsall]].]]\n\nAyre died after a battle against cancer on 16 April 2002, just under a month shy of his fiftieth birthday. His wife, Elaine, and children, David and Rachel, were at his bedside at the family's home in [[Ormskirk, Lancashire]].<ref name=\"Funeral\">[http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/blackpoolnews/Popular-Billy-is-laid-to.148544.jp \"Popular Billy laid to rest\"] \u2013 ''[[Blackpool Gazette]]'', 22 April 2002</ref> David was Blackpool's mascot in the Division Four play-off final at Wembley ten years earlier and accompanied his father in the pre-match walk out to the centre circle.\n\nDuring a [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] v. [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] league encounter four days after Ayre's death,<ref>http://www.soccerbase.com/results3.sd?gameid=360037</ref> the away fans rang out an impromptu rendition of \"There's Only One Billy Ayre\", followed by spontaneous applause, in honour of their former manager. [[Mark Bonner]], who Ayre nurtured through from the Blackpool youth ranks, was in the Cardiff team that day.\n\nAyre's funeral took place on 21 April at [[St. Cuthbert's Church, Halsall|St. Cuthbert's Church]] in [[Halsall]], near Ormskirk,<ref name=\"Funeral\"/> and his final wish was to have the Blackpool team with whom he won promotion in 1992 be present.<ref>[http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/sports-news/Blackpool-heroes-to-honour-Billy.149300.jp \"Blackpool heroes to honour Billy\"] \u2013 ''[[Blackpool Gazette]]'', 18 April 2002</ref> His wish was granted.<ref name=\"Funeral\"/>\n\nDuring the service, Revd. Heather Penman related an event that had touched Ayre during the final year of his life. On 26 May 2001, Ayre had attended the [[Football League Two]] play-off final between Blackpool and Leyton Orient at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in his then-home, [[Cardiff]]. As he was walking to the stadium, he was spotted by some Blackpool fans, who proceeded to pick up their former manager and carry him shoulder-high into the stadium.<ref name=\"Funeral\"/> \"I expect he did that famous fist sign as they took him in,\" said Penman. \"And Elaine said Billy was absolutely delighted by that gesture.\"<ref name=\"Funeral\"/>\n\n\"He was a fantastic fella, I couldn't speak highly enough about him,\" said [[Phil Brown (footballer born 1959)|Phil Brown]], who played alongside Ayre at [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]] and [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] and under him at the latter. \"He tried to play the game the way it should be played. He had a funny side to him that not many people saw, and had the ability to turn a serious situation and make light of it. He was the salt of the earth, a man you could trust with your life.

As [[Roy Calley]] wrote in his 1992 book, ''Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887\u20131992'', Ayre, almost unknown outside the lower leagues, was \"greeted reservedly by Blackpool supporters, yet in the space of two years [had] become the club's most popular \u2013 and certainly most successful \u2013 boss since [[Stan Mortensen]]\". On matchdays, he wore the number 15 Blackpool shirt, in the days when only three substitutes (numbers 12 to 14) were permitted for league games.\n\nWhen Carr left, Blackpool were lying in eighteenth position in the Division Four table; six months later, however, the team had qualified for the play-offs after losing only five of their remaining thirty games. Between 10 November 1990 and 19 November 1991 two new (and still existing) club records were set: fifteen consecutive home League wins in what turned out to be a twenty-four-game unbeaten run at [[Bloomfield Road]]. (The match that set the ball rolling, a 4\u20132 victory over [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]], was under the guidance of Carr.) Their good fortune came undone at the last hurdle, however, when they lost in a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] to [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] in the final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] and remained in the Fourth Division for another season. (In an interview at the final whistle, Ayre said, \"I've never had a worse moment in my life, never mind football.\")<ref>''[[The Seasiders (DVD)|The Seasiders]]''</ref>\n\nAyre was able to keep largely the same team together and guided them back to Wembley the following [[Blackpool F.C. season 1991-92#Play-offs|1991\u201392]] season, in which they finally gained promotion after another, more successful penalties experience. [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] were the unlucky team on this occasion. Blackpool had booked their place in the new [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]]. Ayre dedicated the victory to his parents, who died the previous year.<ref>''Blackpool Football Club: Classic Matches'' DVD</ref>\n\nThe [[1992-93 in English football|following season]] saw ''the Seasiders'' finish in a lowly eighteenth position after winning only twelve of their forty-six games.\n\nOn the final day of the [[1993-94 in English football|1993\u201394]] season, Blackpool avoided relegation by a single point by virtue of beating [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] 4\u20131 at Bloomfield Road. Ayre was sacked in June by then-chairman [[Owen Oyston]] after ''the Seasiders'' failed to impress at their new level. He was succeeded by [[Sam Allardyce]]. Ayre's league record in his three-and-a-half years at Bloomfield Road: 191 games, 77 wins, 70 draws, 44 losses.<ref>[http://www.soccerbase.com/managers2.sd?managerid=167 Ayre's managerial stats at Soccerbase]</ref> At the time of his departure, Ayre was the sixth-longest-serving Blackpool manager in terms of Football League games in charge.\n\nAyre achieved not only promotion but subsequently survival with very little financial backing from Oyston.<ref>Calley, Roy (1992). ''Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887\u20131992'', Breedon Books Sport {{ISBN|1-873626-07-X}}</ref> After a defeat at his former club, Hartlepool United, on 2 October 1992, Ayre confronted the travelling support, who had been shouting to Ayre to spend some money. He explained how his access to finances were tied by his chairman. During this period, players such as [[Alan Wright]], [[Paul Groves (footballer)|Paul Groves]], and, most notably, [[Trevor Sinclair]] all left the club for bigger and better things. Despite this, Ayre's sides battled, grafted, and occasionally shocked sides with far greater resources at their disposal. As demonstrated in the retrospective DVD ''[[The Seasiders (DVD)|The Seasiders]]'', a feature of the Geordie's time at Bloomfield Road was his \"ticker-tape entrance\" in games at Bloomfield Road \u2013 fans throwing paper aloft whilst Ayre made his way across to the dugout on the east side of the ground. He would acknowledge the fans, then clench his fists, urging ''the Seasiders''{{'}} faithful to back his team.\n\n===Scarborough===\nAyre's next stop was Scarborough, where he arrived in August [[1994-95 in English football|1994]], some twenty years after playing for the Yorkshiremen. His reign at the [[McCain Stadium]] lasted just four months, after he was sacked for failing to turn around the [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] strugglers.\n\n===Southport===\nA short-but-successful stint at [[non-League]] [[Southport F.C.|Southport]] followed during the 1994\u201395 season. Ayre had guided ''the Sandgrounders'' to a third-placed finishing position.\n\n===Swansea City===\nIn March 1996, Ayre was asked by new [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea City]] boss [[Jan M\u00f8lby]] to be his assistant, but the duo arrived too late to prevent ''the Swans'' from sliding into Division Three. They reached the play-off final a year later, but a last-minute goal saw them lose to [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] and miss out on promotion.

That may sound strange, but it was outside my control, so I got on with things. Now the Cardiff City job has been given to me, albeit temporarily for now, and that ''is'' within my control. I haven't spoken to Frank yet, because he has gone away. But I will talk to him soon.\"<ref name=\"CCFC\"/>\n\nAlso regarding his tumor, he stated: \"I'm not at all frightened. I know the risks.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family.

Such an ideal of an enlightened disciple with ascetic values, as depicted in Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and in a more extreme form in the disciple Bakkula, could reflect sentiments and inclinations among some groups of early Buddhists.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=19}}\n\nClarke argues that the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as a detached ascetic was the way he was \"branded\" by the early Buddhists to the public in general.

However, in the accounts about the First Council, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa appears very prominent, whereas \u0100nanda is humbled and given far less credit.

These differences have affected the scriptures of each tradition:{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Findly |1992 |pages=253}}.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b]].{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist [[I.

This may have been the work of the translators.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=303}} In Mah\u0101y\u0101na iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with \u0100nanda at the right.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Er xieshi}} The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of [[Greco-Buddhism]],<!--417--> and Migot argued that the tradition of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and \u0100nanda being the Buddha's two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, because in the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing.<!--536-->{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=417, 536}}{{refn |group=note |As for Therav\u0101da iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is usually not depicted flanking the Buddha.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pages=42\u201343}}}} In Chan temples, the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition.{{sfn |Jorgensen |2000 |pp=158, 271}} In the history of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism.

In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section within several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family.

Harvey states that the story originated among the \"Chan literati\".}} Although the Flower Sermon's main point is to depict a wordless special transmission \"outside the teaching\", the tradition was defended and authorized through Buddhist scripture.{{sfn |Welter |2000 |p=97}}\n\nThe Flower Sermon event is regarded by modern scholars as an invention, but does provide insight into the philosophical concerns and identity of Chan Buddhism.<ref name=\"Herschock\" /> Since Chan Buddhism values the direct transmission from the teacher's mind to that of the student, more so than scriptures, the unbroken lineage of patriarchs is an important part of the tradition.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=fozu}} Moreover, whereas in many Buddhist traditions it was recounted that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa would pass on Gautama Buddha's robe to Maitreya Buddha, in Chan a different tradition developed, in which Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa passed on the robe to the next patriarch \u0100nanda, and so on through a list of Indian and Chinese patriarchs.<!--339--> Some Chan masters, such as [[D\u014dgen]] (1200\u20131253), did believe that this robe would eventually be passed forward to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and eventually Maitreya.<!--340-->{{sfn |Faure |1995 |pp=339\u2013340}}\n\nAs Japanese Buddhist texts saw the transmission of Gautama Buddha's robe as a symbol of birth and gestation, similarly, the flower in the Flower Sermon was seen as a symbol of death and cremation.{{sfn |Faure |1995 |p=361, note 119}} Besides the Flower Sermon, the appearance of the Buddha's feet when Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa pays his final respects, as well as the Buddha sharing his seat with Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa are also considered mind-to-mind transmissions.{{sfn |Do-Ryun |1964 |p=41}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Values ===\n[[File:Mahakasyapa, Kizil, Cave above the Largest Cave, c. 422-529 AD, wall painting - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC01724.JPG|Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa depicted with hair and beard.

Monastic vocations and monastic orders tend to be along these two ends of the spectrum,<!--177-178--> with compassionate engagement on the one hand, and dispassionate detachment on the other hand.<!--187--> This can be traced back to these two disciples.<!--178-->{{sfn |Tilakaratne |2003 |pp=177\u2013178, 187}} Specifically, the Therav\u0101da tradition has been influenced much by the model of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa.{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=17}} In some early Therav\u0101da texts about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, the values of forest renunciation are contrasted with that of settled monasticism.

Indeed, later Buddhist texts depict Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as the eldest son of the Buddha, who leads both the funerals of his father and, as his heir, presides over the First Council.<!--20-21--> Eventually, he came to be seen as the first teacher after the Buddha and as the beginning of a lineage of teachers. This conceptualization is found within several Buddhist schools, including the Therav\u0101dins and the [[Mahasanghika|Mah\u0101sa\u1e45ghikas]].<!--21-22 n 78-->{{sfn |Tournier |2014 |pp=17\u201318, note 62, 20\u201322, note 78}} Indeed, Therav\u0101da sees him as a sort of \"Father of the Church\".{{sfn |Lagirarde |2006}}\n\n=== Historical lineages ===\nFurthermore, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is described in the P\u0101li commentary to the ''D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya'' as the person responsible for the preservation of collection that was the precursor to the ''Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya'' and the ''Sa\u1e43yuktaka \u0100gama''. In both the Nik\u0101ya and \u0100gama version of this same collection, therefore, a great deal of attention is given to him, and Tournier thinks it possible that the lineage of teachers preserving this collection, probably originating from the Sth\u0101viras, also conceived themselves as preservers of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's legacy.<!--26--> This is also reflected in the language used in inscriptions from the Sinhalese monk Mah\u0101n\u0101man (5th\u20136th century CE) and in later texts used in the Sinhalese tradition, which both connect Mah\u0101n\u0101man's lineage with that of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, and also that of the future Buddha Maitreya.<!--26-29-->{{sfn |Tournier |2014 |pp=26\u201329}} However, some P\u0101li sources indicate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was part of the lineage of the ''A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya'' [[Bh\u0101\u1e47aka|reciters]] instead.{{sfn |Gethin |2008 |p=18}}\n\nOne of the early Buddhist schools, the [[K\u0101\u015byap\u012bya]]s ({{lang-pi|Kassap\u012bya}}), was founded by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, according to scholars [[Paramartha|Param\u0101rtha]] (499\u2013569) and [[Kuiji]] (632\u2013682).

{"title_page": "Refrigeration", "text_new": "{{Short description|Process of moving heat from one location to another in controlled conditions}}\n[[File:Kuehlregal USA.jpg|thumb|Commercial refrigeration]]\n\n'''Refrigeration''' is a process that removes heat from a space, substance, or system to lower and/or maintain its temperature below the ambient temperature. In other words, refrigeration is artificial (human-made) [[cooling]].<ref>International Dictionary of Refrigeration, http://dictionary.iifiir.org/search.php</ref><ref>ASHRAE Terminology, https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/free-resources/ashrae-terminology</ref> Energy in the form of heat is removed from a low-temperature reservoir and transferred to a high-temperature reservoir. The work of energy transfer is traditionally driven by [[work (physics)|mechanical]] means, but can also be driven by heat, [[magnetism]], [[electricity]], [[laser cooling|laser]], or other means. Refrigeration has many applications, including household [[refrigerator]]s, industrial [[freezer]]s, [[cryogenics]], and [[air conditioning]]. [[Heat pump]]s may use the heat output of the refrigeration process, and also may be designed to be reversible, but are otherwise similar to air conditioning units.\n\nRefrigeration has had a large impact on industry, lifestyle, agriculture, and settlement patterns. The idea of preserving food dates back to at least the ancient Roman and Chinese empires. However, mechanical refrigeration technology has rapidly evolved in the last century, from [[ice harvesting]] to [[Refrigerator car|temperature-controlled rail cars]]. The introduction of refrigerated rail cars contributed to the westward expansion of the United States, allowing settlement in areas that were not on main transport channels such as rivers, harbors, or valley trails. Settlements were also developing in infertile parts of the country, filled with newly discovered natural resources.\n\nThese new settlement patterns sparked the building of large cities which are able to thrive in areas that were otherwise thought to be inhospitable, such as [[Houston]], Texas, and [[Las Vegas]], Nevada. In most developed countries, cities are heavily dependent upon refrigeration in [[Supermarket|supermarkets]] in order to obtain their food for daily consumption. The increase in food sources has led to a larger concentration of agricultural sales coming from a smaller percentage of farms. Farms today have a much larger output per person in comparison to the late 1800s. This has resulted in new food sources available to entire populations, which has had a large impact on the nutrition of society.\n\nAs quite similar criteria shall be fulfilled by [[working fluid]]s ([[refrigerant]]s) applied to heat pumps, refrigeration, and [[organic Rankine cycle]]s; several working fluids are applied by these technologies. Ammonia was one of the first refrigerants. Refrigeration can be defined as \"The science of providing and maintaining temperature below that of surrounding atmosphere\". It is the continuous extraction of heat from a body.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}\n\n===Earliest forms of cooling===\nThe seasonal harvesting of snow and ice is an ancient practice estimated to have begun earlier than 1000 BC.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last=Neuburger|first=Albert|title=The technical arts and sciences of the ancients|year=2003|publisher=Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=978-0-7103-0755-2|page=122}}</ref> A Chinese collection of lyrics from this time period known as the ''[[Shijing]]'', describes religious ceremonies for filling and emptying ice cellars. However, little is known about the construction of these ice cellars or what the ice was used for. The next ancient society to record the harvesting of ice may have been the Jews in the book of Proverbs, which reads, \u201cAs the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them who sent him.\u201d Historians have interpreted this to mean that the Jews used ice to cool beverages rather than to preserve food. Other ancient cultures such as the Greeks and the Romans dug large snow pits insulated with grass, chaff, or branches of trees as cold storage. Like the Jews, the Greeks and Romans did not use ice and snow to preserve food, but primarily as a means to cool beverages. The Egyptians also developed methods to cool beverages, but in lieu of using ice to cool water, the Egyptians cooled water by putting boiling water in shallow earthen jars and placing them on the roofs of their houses at night. Slaves would moisten the outside of the jars and the resulting evaporation would cool the water. The ancient people of India used this same concept to produce ice. The Persians stored ice in a pit called a [[Yakhchal]] and may have been the first group of people to use cold storage to preserve food. In the Australian outback before a reliable electricity supply was available where the weather could be hot and dry, many farmers used a [[Coolgardie safe]]. This consisted of a room with [[hessian fabric|hessian]] (burlap) curtains hanging from the ceiling soaked in water. The water would evaporate and thereby cool the hessian curtains and thereby the air circulating in the room. This would allow many perishables such as fruit, butter, and cured meats to be kept that would normally spoil in the heat.<ref>{{cite book|last=Neuburger|first=Albert|title=The technical arts and sciences of the ancients|year=2003|publisher=Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=978-0-7103-0755-2|pages=122\u2013124}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=5\u20136}}</ref>\n\n===Ice harvesting===\n{{See also|Ice cutting|Ice trade}}\n[[File:Ice Harvesting, Massachusetts, early 1850s.jpg|thumb|Ice harvesting in [[Massachusetts]], 1852, showing the [[railroad]] line in the background, used to transport the ice.]]\nBefore 1830, few Americans used ice to refrigerate foods due to a lack of ice-storehouses and iceboxes. As these two things became more widely available, individuals used axes and saws to [[ice cutting|harvest ice]] for their storehouses. This method proved to be difficult, dangerous, and certainly did not resemble anything that could be duplicated on a commercial scale.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=8\u201311}}</ref>\n\nDespite the difficulties of harvesting ice, Frederic Tudor thought that he could capitalize on this new commodity by harvesting ice in New England and shipping it to the Caribbean islands as well as the southern states. In the beginning, Tudor lost thousands of dollars, but eventually turned a profit as he constructed icehouses in Charleston, Virginia and in the Cuban port town of Havana. These icehouses as well as better insulated ships helped reduce ice wastage from 66% to 8%. This efficiency gain influenced Tudor to expand his ice market to other towns with icehouses such as New Orleans and Savannah. This ice market further expanded as harvesting ice became faster and cheaper after one of Tudor's suppliers, Nathaniel Wyeth, invented a horse-drawn ice cutter in 1825. This invention as well as Tudor's success inspired others to get involved in the [[ice trade]] and the ice industry grew.\n\nIce became a mass-market commodity by the early 1830s with the price of ice dropping from six cents per pound to a half of a cent per pound. In New York City, ice consumption increased from 12,000 tons in 1843 to 100,000 tons in 1856. Boston's consumption leapt from 6,000 tons to 85,000 tons during that same period. Ice harvesting created a \u201ccooling culture\u201d as majority of people used ice and iceboxes to store their dairy products, fish, meat, and even fruits and vegetables. These early cold storage practices paved the way for many Americans to accept the refrigeration technology that would soon take over the country.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=11\u201313}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=20\u201323|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref>\n\n===Refrigeration research===\n[[File:William Cullen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Cullen]], the first to conduct experiments into artificial refrigeration.]]\nThe history of artificial refrigeration began when Scottish professor [[William Cullen]] designed a small refrigerating machine in 1755.

They confirmed that the evaporation of highly volatile liquids, such as alcohol and ether, could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to quicken the evaporation; they lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to {{convert|7|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, while the ambient temperature was {{convert|65|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. They noted that soon after they passed the freezing point of water (32&nbsp;\u00b0F), a thin film of ice formed on the surface of the thermometer's bulb and that the ice mass was about a quarter inch thick when they stopped the experiment upon reaching {{convert|7|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}. Franklin wrote, \"From this experiment, one may see the possibility of freezing a man to death on a warm summer's day\".<ref>[http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm Cooling by Evaporation (Letter to John Lining)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128075748/http://www.historycarper.com/resources/twobf3/letter1.htm |date=2011-01-28}}. Benjamin Franklin, London, June 17, 1758</ref> In 1805, American inventor [[Oliver Evans]] described a closed [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle for the production of ice by ether under vacuum.\n\nIn 1820 the English scientist [[Michael Faraday]] liquefied [[ammonia]] and other gases by using high pressures and low temperatures, and in 1834, an American expatriate to Great Britain, [[Jacob Perkins]], built the first working vapor-compression refrigeration system in the world. It was a closed-cycle that could operate continuously, as he described in his patent:\n:I am enabled to use volatile fluids for the purpose of producing the cooling or freezing of fluids, and yet at the same time constantly condensing such volatile fluids, and bringing them again into operation without waste.\n\nHis prototype system worked although it did not succeed commercially.<ref name=burstall>{{cite book |last= Burstall |first= Aubrey F. |year= 1965 |title= A History of Mechanical Engineering |publisher= The MIT Press |isbn= 978-0-262-52001-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1842, a similar attempt was made by American physician, [[John Gorrie]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00008080&homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D0008080.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F0008080%2526RS%3DPN%2F0008080&PageNum=&Rtype=&SectionNum=&idkey=NONE&Input=View+first+page|title=Patent Images}}</ref> who built a working prototype, but it was a commercial failure.

American engineer [[Alexander Twining]] took out a British patent in 1850 for a vapour compression system that used ether.\n\nThe first practical vapour-compression refrigeration system was built by [[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]], a British journalist who had emigrated to [[Australia]]. His 1856 patent was for a vapour-compression system using ether, alcohol, or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapour-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat-packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation. He later entered the debate of how to compete against the American advantage of unrefrigerated [[beef]] sales to the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1873 he prepared the sailing ship ''Norfolk'' for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom, which used a cold room system instead of a refrigeration system. The venture was a failure as the ice was consumed faster than expected.\n\n[[File:AppareilCarr\u00e9.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ferdinand Carr\u00e9]]'s ice-making device]]\nThe first [[absorption refrigeration|gas absorption]] refrigeration system using gaseous ammonia dissolved in water (referred to as \"aqua ammonia\") was developed by [[Ferdinand Carr\u00e9]] of France in 1859 and patented in 1860. [[Carl von Linde]], an engineer specializing in [[steam locomotive]]s and professor of engineering at the [[Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen|Technological University of Munich]] in Germany, began researching refrigeration in the 1860s and 1870s in response to demand from brewers for a technology that would allow year-round, large-scale production of [[lager]]; he patented an improved method of liquefying gases in 1876.<ref>{{cite episode |title= Eat, Drink, and Be Merry |url= |accessdate= |series= Connections |serieslink=Connections (TV series)|credits= [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] |network=BBC |date=1979 |number= 8|minutes=41\u201349 |transcript= |transcripturl= |language=English}}</ref> His new process made possible using gases such as [[ammonia]], [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and [[methyl chloride]] (CH<sub>3</sub>Cl) as refrigerants and they were widely used for that purpose until the late 1920s.\n\n[[Thaddeus Lowe]], an American balloonist, held several patents on ice-making machines. His \"Compression Ice Machine\" would revolutionize the cold-storage industry. In 1869 other investors and he purchased an old steamship onto which they loaded one of Lowe's refrigeration units and began shipping fresh fruit from New York to the Gulf Coast area, and fresh meat from Galveston, Texas back to New York, but because of Lowe's lack of knowledge about shipping, the business was a costly failure.\n\n===Commercial use===\n{{See also|Refrigerator}}\n[[File:Early refrigerator car design circa 1870.jpg|thumb|An 1870 refrigerator car design.

Although it was a commercial failure, it inspired scientists and inventors around the world. France's Ferdinand Carre was one of the inspired and he created an ice producing system that was simpler and smaller than that of Gorrie. During the Civil War, cities such as New Orleans could no longer get ice from New England via the coastal ice trade. Carre's refrigeration system became the solution to New Orleans ice problems and by 1865 the city had three of Carre's machines.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=25}}</ref> In 1867, in San Antonio, Texas, a French immigrant named Andrew Muhl built an ice-making machine to help service the expanding beef industry before moving it to Waco in 1871. In 1873, the patent for this machine was contracted by the Columbus Iron Works, a company acquired by the W.C. Bradley Co., which went on to produce the first commercial ice-makers in the US.\n\nBy the 1870s breweries had become the largest users of harvested ice. Though the ice-harvesting industry had grown immensely by the turn of the 20th century, pollution and sewage had begun to creep into natural ice, making it a problem in the metropolitan suburbs. Eventually, breweries began to complain of tainted ice. Public concern for the purity of water, from which ice was formed, began to increase in the early 1900s with the rise of germ theory. Numerous media outlets published articles connecting diseases such as typhoid fever with natural ice consumption. This caused ice harvesting to become illegal in certain areas of the country. All of these scenarios increased the demands for modern refrigeration and manufactured ice. Ice producing machines like that of Carre's and Muhl's were looked to as means of producing ice to meet the needs of grocers, farmers, and food shippers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=25|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=110\u2013111}}</ref>\n\nRefrigerated railroad cars were introduced in the US in the 1840s for short-run transport of dairy products, but these used harvested ice to maintain a cool temperature.<ref>[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/dqr01 Refrigeration], Texas State Historical Association.</ref>\n\n[[File:SS Dunedin by Frederick Tudgay.JPG|thumb|left|[[Dunedin (ship)|''Dunedin'']], the first commercially successful refrigerated ship.]]\nThe new refrigerating technology first met with widespread industrial use as a means to freeze meat supplies for transport by sea in [[reefer ship]]s from the British [[Dominion]]s and other countries to the [[British Isles]]. The first to achieve this breakthrough was an entrepreneur who had emigrated to [[New Zealand]]. [[William Soltau Davidson]] thought that Britain's rising population and meat demand could mitigate the slump in world [[wool]] markets that was heavily affecting New Zealand. After extensive research, he commissioned the [[Dunedin (ship)|''Dunedin'']] to be refitted with a compression refrigeration unit for meat shipment in 1881. On February 15, 1882, the ''Dunedin'' sailed for London with what was to be the first commercially successful refrigerated shipping voyage, and the foundation of the refrigerated [[meat industry]].<ref>{{cite book|title=A lasting Legacy \u2013 A 125 year history of New Zealand Farming since the first Frozen Meat Shipment|author=Colin Williscroft|publisher=NZ Rural Press Limited|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VTrmMQAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Times]]'' commented \"Today we have to record such a triumph over physical difficulties, as would have been incredible, even unimaginable, a very few days ago...\". The ''[[Marlborough (1876 ship)|Marlborough]]''\u2014sister ship to the ''Dunedin'' \u2013 was immediately converted and joined the trade the following year, along with the rival New Zealand Shipping Company vessel ''Mataurua'', while the German Steamer ''Marsala'' began carrying frozen New Zealand lamb in December 1882. Within five years, 172 shipments of frozen meat were sent from New Zealand to the United Kingdom, of which only 9 had significant amounts of meat condemned. Refrigerated shipping also led to a broader meat and dairy boom in [[Australasia]] and South America. [[J & E Hall]] of [[Dartford]], England outfitted the 'SS Selembria' with a vapor compression system to bring 30,000 carcasses of [[mutton]] from the [[Falkland Islands]] in 1886.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jehall.com/about-jeh-group/history|title=Our History &#124; Refrigeration Solutions &#124; J&E Hall|website=www.jehall.com}}</ref> In the years ahead, the industry rapidly expanded to Australia, Argentina and the United States.\n\nBy the 1890s refrigeration played a vital role in the distribution of food. The meat-packing industry relied heavily on natural ice in the 1880s and continued to rely on manufactured ice as those technologies became available.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=142|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref> By 1900, the meat-packing houses of Chicago had adopted ammonia-cycle commercial refrigeration. By 1914 almost every location used artificial refrigeration. The [[Meat packing industry#Meatpackers|major meat packers]], Armour, Swift, and Wilson, had purchased the most expensive units which they installed on train cars and in branch houses and storage facilities in the more remote distribution areas.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, refrigeration units were designed for installation on trucks or lorries. Refrigerated vehicles are used to transport perishable goods, such as frozen foods, fruit and vegetables, and temperature-sensitive chemicals. Most modern refrigerators keep the temperature between \u201340 and \u201320&nbsp;\u00b0C, and have a maximum payload of around 24,000&nbsp;kg gross weight (in Europe).\n\nAlthough commercial refrigeration quickly progressed, it had limitations that prevented it from moving into the household. First, most refrigerators were far too large. Some of the commercial units being used in 1910 weighed between five and two hundred tons. Second, commercial refrigerators were expensive to produce, purchase, and maintain. Lastly, these refrigerators were unsafe. It was not uncommon for commercial refrigerators to catch fire, explode, or leak toxic gases. Refrigeration did not become a household technology until these three challenges were overcome.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=38|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref>\n\n===Home and consumer use===\n[[File:Early household refrigerator in Popular Science 1919.png|thumb|An early example of the [[consumerization]] of mechanical refrigeration that began in the early 20th century. The [[refrigerant]] was [[sulfur dioxide]].]]\n[[File:Food into a refrigerator - 20111002.jpg|thumb|A modern home refrigerator]]\n\nDuring the early 1800s consumers preserved their food by storing food and ice purchased from ice harvesters in iceboxes. In 1803, Thomas Moore patented a metal-lined butter-storage tub which became the prototype for most iceboxes. These iceboxes were used until nearly 1910 and the technology did not progress. In fact, consumers that used the icebox in 1910 faced the same challenge of a moldy and stinky icebox that consumers had in the early 1800s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=23, 38|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref>\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) was one of the first companies to overcome these challenges. In 1911 GE released a household refrigeration unit that was powered by gas. The use of gas eliminated the need for an electric compressor motor and decreased the size of the refrigerator. However, electric companies that were customers of GE did not benefit from a gas-powered unit. Thus, GE invested in developing an electric model. In 1927, GE released the Monitor Top, the first refrigerator to run on electricity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=43\u201345|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Frigidaire, one of GE's main competitors, synthesized [[Freon]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=44|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref> With the invention of synthetic refrigerants based mostly on a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) chemical, safer refrigerators were possible for home and consumer use. Freon led to the development of smaller, lighter, and cheaper refrigerators. The average price of a refrigerator dropped from $275 to $154 with the synthesis of Freon. This lower price allowed ownership of refrigerators in American households to exceed 50%.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=45|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref> Freon is a trademark of the DuPont Corporation and refers to these CFCs, and later hydro chlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) and hydro fluorocarbon (HFC), refrigerants developed in the late 1920s. These refrigerants were considered at the time to be less harmful than the commonly-used refrigerants of the time, including methyl formate, ammonia, methyl chloride, and sulfur dioxide. The intent was to provide refrigeration equipment for home use without danger. These CFC refrigerants answered that need. In the 1970s, though, the compounds were found to be reacting with atmospheric ozone, an important protection against solar ultraviolet radiation, and their use as a refrigerant worldwide was curtailed in the Montreal Protocol of 1987.\n\n==Impact on settlement patterns==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn the last century refrigeration allowed new settlement patterns to emerge. This new technology has allowed for new areas to be settled that are not on a natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbor that may have otherwise not been settled. Refrigeration has given opportunities to early settlers to expand westward and into rural areas that were unpopulated. These new settlers with rich and untapped soil saw opportunity to profit by sending raw goods to the eastern cities and states. In the 20th century, refrigeration has made \u201cGalactic Cities\u201d such as Dallas, Phoenix and Los Angeles possible.\n\n===Refrigerated rail cars===\nThe refrigerated rail car ([[refrigerated van]] or [[refrigerator car]]), along with the dense railroad network, became an exceedingly important link between the marketplace and the farm allowing for a national opportunity rather than a just a regional one. Before the invention of the refrigerated rail car it was impossible to ship perishable food products long distances. The beef packing industry made the first demand push for refrigeration cars. The railroad companies were slow to adopt this new invention because of their heavy investments in cattle cars, stockyards, and feedlots.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=2}}</ref> Refrigeration cars were also complex and costly compared to other rail cars, which also slowed the adoption of the refrigerated rail car. After the slow adoption of the refrigerated car, the beef packing industry dominated the refrigerated rail car business with their ability to control ice plants and the setting of icing fees. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated that in 1916 over sixty-nine percent of the cattle killed in the country was done in plants involved in interstate trade. The same companies that were also involved in the meat trade later implemented refrigerated transport to include vegetables and fruit. The meat packing companies had much of the expensive machinery, such as refrigerated cars, and cold storage facilities that allowed for them to effectively distribute all types of perishable goods. During World War I, a national refrigerator car pool was established by the United States Administration to deal with problem of idle cars and was later continued after the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=}}</ref> The idle car problem was the problem of refrigeration cars sitting pointlessly in between seasonal harvests. This meant that very expensive cars sat in rail yards for a good portion of the year while making no revenue for the car's owner. The car pool was a system where cars were distributed to areas as crops matured ensuring maximum use of the cars. Refrigerated rail cars moved eastward from vineyards, orchards, fields, and gardens in western states to satisfy Americas consuming market in the east.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=3}}</ref> The refrigerated car made it possible to transport perishable crops hundreds and even thousands of miles. The most noticeable effect the car gave was a regional specialization of vegetables and fruits. The refrigeration rail car was widely used for the transportation of perishable goods up until the 1950s. By the 1960s the nation's interstate highway system was adequately complete allowing for trucks to carry the majority of the perishable food loads and to push out the old system of the refrigerated rail cars.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stover|first=J.|title=American Railroads|journal=The Chicago History of the Railroad Refrigerator Car|year=1970|pages=214}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion west and into rural areas===\nThe widespread use of refrigeration allowed for a vast amount of new agricultural opportunities to open up in the United States. New markets emerged throughout the United States in areas that were previously uninhabited and far-removed from heavily populated areas. New agricultural opportunity presented itself in areas that were considered rural such as states in the south and in the west. Shipments on a large scale from the south and California were both made around the same time although natural ice was used from the Sierras in California rather than manufactured ice in the south.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=7}}</ref> Refrigeration allowed for many areas to specialize in the growing of specific fruits. California specialized in several fruits, grapes, peaches, pears, plums, and apples while Georgia became famous for specifically its peaches. In California, the acceptance of the refrigerated rail carts lead to an increase of car loads from 4,500 carloads in 1895 to between 8,000 and 10,000 carloads in 1905.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=156}}</ref> The Gulf States, Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee entered into strawberry production on a large-scale while Mississippi became the center of the [[tomato industry]]. New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada grew cantaloupes. Without refrigeration this would have not been possible. By 1917, well-established fruit and vegetable areas that were close to eastern markets felt the pressure of competition from these distant specialized centers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=158}}</ref> Refrigeration was not limited to meat, fruit and vegetables but it also encompassed dairy product and dairy farms. In the early twentieth century large cities got their dairy supply from farms as far as 400 miles. Dairy products were not as easily transported great distances like fruits and vegetables due to greater perishability. Refrigeration made production possible in the west far from eastern markets, so much in fact that dairy farmers could pay transportation cost and still undersell their eastern competitors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=168}}</ref> Refrigeration and the refrigerated rail gave opportunity to areas with rich soil far from natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbors.<ref name=\"Schimd\">{{cite web|last=Schimd|first=A.|title=The Economics of Population Settlement: Cost of Alternative Growth Patterns|url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/Extension/ncrcrd/NCRCRD-rrd172-print.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Rise of the galactic city===\n\"Edge city\" was a term coined by [[Joel Garreau]], whereas the term \"galactic city\" was coined by [[Lewis Mumford]]. These terms refer to a concentration of business, shopping, and entertainment outside a traditional downtown or central business district in what had previously been a residential or rural area. There were several factors contributing to the growth of these cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston, and Phoenix. The factors that contributed to these large cities include reliable automobiles, highway systems, refrigeration, and agricultural production increases. Large cities such as the ones mentioned above have not been uncommon in history but what separates these cities from the rest are that these cities are not along some natural channel of transport, or at some crossroad of two or more channels such as a trail, harbor, mountain, river, or valley. These large cities have been developed in areas that only a few hundred years ago would have been uninhabitable. Without a cost efficient way of cooling air and transporting water and food great distances these large cities would have never developed. The rapid growth of these cities was influenced by refrigeration and an agricultural productivity increase, allowing more distant farms to effectively feed the population.<ref name=\"Schimd\"/>\n\n==Impact on agriculture and food production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nAgriculture's role in developed countries has drastically changed in the last century due to many factors, including refrigeration. Statistics from the 2007 census gives information on the large concentration of agricultural sales coming from a small portion of the existing farms in the United States today. This is a partial result of the market created for the frozen meat trade by the first successful shipment of frozen sheep carcasses coming from New Zealand in the 1880s. As the market continued to grow, regulations on food processing and quality began to be enforced. Eventually, electricity was introduced into rural homes in the United States, which allowed refrigeration technology to continue to expand on the farm, increasing output per person. Today, refrigeration's use on the farm reduces humidity levels, avoids spoiling due to bacterial growth, and assists in preservation.\n\n===Demographics===\nThe introduction of refrigeration and evolution of additional technologies drastically changed agriculture in the United States. During the beginning of the 20th century, farming was a common occupation and lifestyle for United States citizens, as most farmers actually lived on their farm. In 1935, there were 6.8 million farms in the United States and a population of 127 million. Yet, while the United States population has continued to climb, citizens pursuing agriculture continue to decline. Based on the 2007 US Census, less than one percent of a population of 310 million people claim farming as an occupation today. However, the increasing population has led to an increasing demand for agricultural products, which is met through a greater variety of crops, fertilizers, pesticides, and improved technology. Improved technology has decreased the risk and time involved if agricultural management and allows larger farms to increase their output per person to meet society's demand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Demographics|url=http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/ag101/demographics.html|date=2015-03-19}}</ref>\n\n===Meat packing and trade===\nPrior to 1882, the [[South Island]] of New Zealand had been experimenting with sowing grass and crossbreeding sheep, which immediately gave their farmers economic potential in the exportation of meat. In 1882, the first successful shipment of sheep carcasses was sent from [[Port Chalmers]] in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand, to [[London]]. By the 1890s, the frozen meat trade became increasingly more profitable in New Zealand, especially in [[Canterbury]], where 50% of exported sheep carcasses came from in 1900. It wasn't long before Canterbury meat was known for the highest quality, creating a demand for New Zealand meat around the world. In order to meet this new demand, the farmers improved their feed so sheep could be ready for the slaughter in only seven months. This new method of shipping led to an economic boom in New Zealand by the mid 1890s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peden|first=R.|title=Farming in the Economy-Refrigeration and Sheep Farming|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/farming-in-the-economy/page-3}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the Meat Inspection Act of 1891 was put in place in the United States because local butchers felt the refrigerated railcar system was unwholesome.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Libecap|title=The Rise of the Chicago Meat Packers and the Origins of Meat Inspection and Antitrust|journal=Economic Inquiry |volume=30|pages=242\u2013262|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.1992.tb01656.x|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/h0029.pdf}}</ref> When meat packing began to take off, consumers became nervous about the quality of the meat for consumption. [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' brought negative attention to the meat packing industry, by drawing to light unsanitary working conditions and processing of diseased animals. The book caught the attention of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[Federal Meat Inspection Act|the 1906 Meat Inspection Act]] was put into place as an amendment to the Meat Inspection Act of 1891. This new act focused on the quality of the meat and environment it is processed in.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rockoff|first=Gary M.

At the time, power companies did not feel that extending power to rural areas ([[rural electrification]]) would produce enough profit to make it worth their while. However, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], President Franklin D. Roosevelt realized that rural areas would continue to lag behind urban areas in both poverty and production if they were not electrically wired. On May 11, 1935, the president signed an executive order called the Rural Electrification Administration, also known as REA. The agency provided loans to fund electric infrastructure in the rural areas. In just a few years, 300,000 people in rural areas of the United States had received power in their homes.\n\nWhile electricity dramatically improved working conditions on farms, it also had a large impact on the safety of food production. Refrigeration systems were introduced to the farming and [[food distribution]] processes, which helped in [[food preservation]] and [[food safety|kept food supplies safe]]. Refrigeration also allowed for production of perishable commodities, which could then be shipped throughout the United States. As a result, the United States farmers quickly became the most productive in the world,<ref>{{Citation|periodical=Rural Cooperatives|last=Campbell|first=D.|title=When the Lights Came On|url=http://www.rd.usda.gov/files/CoopMag-aug00.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424031515/http://www.rd.usda.gov/files/CoopMag-aug00.pdf|archivedate=2015-04-24|date=August 2000}}</ref> and entire new [[food systems]] arose.\n\n===Farm use===\nIn order to reduce humidity levels and spoiling due to bacterial growth, refrigeration is used for meat, produce, and dairy processing in farming today. Refrigeration systems are used the heaviest in the warmer months for farming produce, which must be cooled as soon as possible in order to meet quality standards and increase the shelf life.

The change in our method of food preservation moved us away from salts to a more manageable sodium level. The ability to move and store perishables such as meat and dairy led to a 1.7% increase in dairy consumption and overall protein intake by 1.25% annually in the US after the 1890s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=L. |author2=Goodwin B. |author3=Grennes T.|title=The Effect of Mechanical Refrigeration on Nutrition in the United States|journal=Social Science History|volume=28|issue=2|pages=325\u2013336|doi=10.1215/01455532-28-2-325|year=2004}}</ref>\n\nPeople were not only consuming these perishables because it became easier for they themselves to store them, but because the innovations in refrigerated transportation and storage led to less spoilage and waste, thereby driving the prices of these products down. Refrigeration accounts for at least 5.1% of the increase in adult stature (in the US) through improved nutrition, and when the indirect effects associated with improvements in the quality of nutrients and the reduction in illness is additionally factored in, the overall impact becomes considerably larger.

''BBC''. 30 April 2008</ref>\n\nIn commerce and manufacturing, there are many uses for refrigeration. Refrigeration is used to liquefy gases \u2013 [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[propane]], and [[methane]], for example. In compressed air purification, it is used to [[condensation|condense]] water vapor from compressed air to reduce its moisture content. In [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[chemical plant]]s, and [[petrochemical]] plants, refrigeration is used to maintain certain processes at their needed low temperatures (for example, in [[alkylation]] of [[butene]]s and [[butane]] to produce a high-[[octane rating|octane]] gasoline component). Metal workers use refrigeration to temper steel and cutlery. When transporting temperature-sensitive foodstuffs and other materials by trucks, trains, airplanes and seagoing vessels, refrigeration is a necessity.\n\nDairy products are constantly in need of refrigeration, and it was only discovered in the past few decades that eggs needed to be refrigerated during shipment rather than waiting to be refrigerated after arrival at the grocery store. Meats, poultry and fish all must be kept in climate-controlled environments before being sold. Refrigeration also helps keep fruits and vegetables edible longer.\n\nOne of the most influential uses of refrigeration was in the development of the [[sushi]]/[[sashimi]] industry in Japan. Before the discovery of refrigeration, many sushi connoisseurs were at risk of contracting diseases. The dangers of unrefrigerated sashimi were not brought to light for decades due to the lack of research and healthcare distribution across rural Japan. Around mid-century, the [[Zojirushi]] corporation, based in Kyoto, made breakthroughs in refrigerator designs, making refrigerators cheaper and more accessible for restaurant proprietors and the general public.\n\n==Methods of refrigeration==\nMethods of refrigeration can be classified as ''non-cyclic'', ''cyclic'', ''thermoelectric'' and ''magnetic''.\n\n===Non-cyclic refrigeration===\n{{Main|Ice trade}}\nThis refrigeration method cools a contained area by melting ice, or by sublimating [[dry ice]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url= https://www.brighthubengineering.com/hvac/20353-methods-of-refrigeration-ice-refrigeration-and-dry-ice-refrigeration/\n|title= Methods of Refrigeration: Ice Refrigeration, Dry Ice Refrigeration\n|website= Brighthub Engineering\n|access-date= 2016-02-29\n|date= 2008-12-22\n}}</ref> Perhaps the simplest example of this is a portable cooler, where items are put in it, then ice is poured over the top. Regular ice can maintain temperatures near, but not below the freezing point, unless salt is used to cool the ice down further (as in a [[ice cream maker#Hand Cranked machines|traditional ice-cream maker]]). Dry ice can reliably bring the temperature well below water freezing point.\n\n===Cyclic refrigeration===\n{{Main|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle}}\nThis consists of a refrigeration cycle, where heat is removed from a low-temperature space or source and rejected to a high-temperature sink with the help of external work, and its inverse, the [[thermodynamic power cycle]]. In the power cycle, heat is supplied from a high-temperature source to the engine, part of the heat being used to produce work and the rest being rejected to a low-temperature sink. This satisfies the [[second law of thermodynamics]].\n\nA ''refrigeration cycle'' describes the changes that take place in the refrigerant as it alternately absorbs and rejects heat as it circulates through a [[refrigerator]]. It is also applied to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning [[HVACR]] work, when describing the \"process\" of refrigerant flow through an HVACR unit, whether it is a packaged or split system.\n\nHeat naturally flows from hot to cold. [[Mechanical work|Work]] is applied to cool a living space or storage volume by pumping heat from a lower temperature heat source into a higher temperature heat sink. [[Thermal insulation|Insulation]] is used to reduce the work and [[energy]] needed to achieve and maintain a lower temperature in the cooled space. The operating principle of the refrigeration cycle was described mathematically by [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] in 1824 as a [[Carnot heat engine|heat engine]].\n\nThe most common types of refrigeration systems use the reverse-Rankine [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle, although [[absorption heat pump]]s are used in a minority of applications.\n\nCyclic refrigeration can be classified as:\n#Vapor cycle, and\n#Gas cycle\n\nVapor cycle refrigeration can further be classified as:\n#[[Vapor-compression refrigeration]]\n#Sorption Refrigeration\n##[[Absorption refrigerator|Vapor-absorption refrigeration]]\n##[[Adsorption refrigeration]]\n\n====Vapor-compression cycle====\n{{See also|Vapor-compression refrigeration}}\n[[File:Refrigeration.png|frame|right|Figure 1: Vapor compression refrigeration]]\n[[File:RefrigerationTS.png|frame|right|Figure 2: Temperature\u2013Entropy diagram]]\nThe vapor-compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators as well as in many large commercial and [[Industrial refrigerator|industrial refrigeration]] systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system.\n\nThe [[thermodynamics]] of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram<ref>[http://web.me.unr.edu/me372/Spring2001/Vapor%20Compression%20Refrigeration%20Cycles.pdf The Ideal Vapor-Compression Cycle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226113352/http://web.me.unr.edu/me372/Spring2001/Vapor%20Compression%20Refrigeration%20Cycles.pdf |date=2007-02-26}}</ref> as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as [[Freon]] enters the [[gas compressor|compressor]] as a vapor. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is compressed at constant [[entropy]] and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature, but still below the [[vapor pressure]] at that temperature. From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4, the vapor travels through the [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] which cools the vapor until it starts condensing, and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. Between points 4 and 5, the liquid refrigerant goes through the [[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]] (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing [[flash evaporation]] and auto-refrigeration of, typically, less than half of the liquid.\n\nThat results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure as shown at point 5. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet at point 1 to complete the thermodynamic cycle.\n\nThe above discussion is based on the ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, and does not take into account real-world effects like frictional pressure drop in the system, slight [[thermodynamic reversibility|thermodynamic irreversibility]] during the compression of the refrigerant vapor, or [[ideal gas|non-ideal gas]] behavior, if any. Vapor compression refrigerators can be arranged in two stages in [[cascade refrigeration]] systems, with the second stage cooling the condenser of the first stage. This can be used for achieving very low temperatures. \n\nMore information about the design and performance of vapor-compression refrigeration systems is available in the classic ''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Perry, R.H. |author2=Green, D.W. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|edition=6th |publisher=McGraw Hill, Inc.|year=1984|isbn=978-0-07-049479-4|title-link=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook}} (see pp. 12-27 through 12-38)</ref>\n\n====Sorption cycle====\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n=====Absorption cycle=====\n{{Main|Absorption refrigerator}}\nIn the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems or [[lithium bromide|LiBr]]-water was popular and widely used. After the development of the vapor compression cycle, the vapor absorption cycle lost much of its importance because of its low [[coefficient of performance]] (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Today, the vapor absorption cycle is used mainly where fuel for heating is available but electricity is not, such as in [[recreational vehicles]] that carry [[liquefied petroleum gas|LP gas]]. It is also used in industrial environments where plentiful waste heat overcomes its inefficiency.\n\nThe absorption cycle is similar to the compression cycle, except for the method of raising the pressure of the refrigerant vapor. In the absorption system, the compressor is replaced by an absorber which dissolves the refrigerant in a suitable liquid, a liquid pump which raises the pressure and a generator which, on heat addition, drives off the refrigerant vapor from the high-pressure liquid. Some work is needed by the liquid pump but, for a given quantity of refrigerant, it is much smaller than needed by the compressor in the vapor compression cycle. In an absorption refrigerator, a suitable combination of refrigerant and absorbent is used. The most common combinations are ammonia (refrigerant) with water (absorbent), and water (refrigerant) with lithium bromide (absorbent).\n\n=====Adsorption cycle=====\n{{Main|Adsorption refrigeration}}\nIn adsorption refrigeration, the refrigerant (adsorbate) could be ammonia, water, [[methanol]], etc, while the adsorbent is a solid, such as [[silicone gel]], [[activated carbon]], or [[zeolite]], unlike in the absorption cycle where absorbent is liquid.\n\n====Gas cycle====\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nWhen the [[working fluid]] is a gas that is compressed and expanded but doesn't change phase, the refrigeration cycle is called a ''gas cycle''. [[Air]] is most often this working fluid. As there is no condensation and evaporation intended in a gas cycle, components corresponding to the condenser and evaporator in a vapor compression cycle are the hot and cold gas-to-gas [[heat exchanger]]s in gas cycles.\n\nThe gas cycle is less efficient than the vapor compression cycle because the gas cycle works on the reverse [[Brayton cycle]] instead of the reverse [[Rankine cycle]]. As such the working fluid does not receive and reject heat at constant temperature. In the gas cycle, the refrigeration effect is equal to the product of the specific heat of the gas and the rise in temperature of the gas in the low temperature side. Therefore, for the same cooling load, a gas refrigeration cycle needs a large mass flow rate and is bulky.\n\nBecause of their lower efficiency and larger bulk, ''air cycle'' coolers are not often used nowadays in terrestrial cooling devices. However, the [[air cycle machine]] is very common on [[gas turbine]]-powered jet [[aircraft]] as cooling and ventilation units, because compressed air is readily available from the engines' compressor sections. Such units also serve the purpose of pressurizing the aircraft.\n\n===Thermoelectric refrigeration===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[Thermoelectric cooling]] uses the [[Peltier effect]] to create a heat [[flux]] between the junction of two types of material. This effect is commonly used in camping and portable coolers and for cooling electronic components and small instruments. Peltier coolers are often used where a traditional vapor-compression cycle refrigerator would be impractical or take up too much space, and in cooled image sensors as an easy, compact and lightweight, if inefficient, way to achieve very low temperatures, using 2 or more stage peltier coolers arranged in a [[cascade refrigeration]] configuration, meaning that 2 or more peltier elements are stacked on top of each other, with each stage being larger than the one before it,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kryothermtec.com/four-stage-thermoelectric-coolers.html|title=4-stage thermoelectric coolers|website=kryothermtec.com}}</ref> in order to extract more heat and waste heat generated by the previous stages. Peltier cooling only has 1/4 the efficiency of the vapor-compression cycle so it doesn't extract as much heat, emits more waste heat (heat generated by the peltier element or cooling mechanism) and consumes more power for a given cooling capacity.\n\n===Magnetic refrigeration===\n{{Main|Magnetic refrigeration}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nMagnetic refrigeration, or [[adiabatic]] [[demagnetization]], is a cooling technology based on the magnetocaloric effect, an [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic property]] of magnetic solids. The refrigerant is often a [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], such as [[cerium]] [[magnesium]] [[nitrate]]. The active [[magnetic field|magnetic]] [[dipole]]s in this case are those of the [[electron shell]]s of the paramagnetic atoms.\n\nA strong magnetic field is applied to the refrigerant, forcing its various magnetic dipoles to align and putting these degrees of freedom of the refrigerant into a state of lowered [[entropy]]. A heat sink then absorbs the heat released by the refrigerant due to its loss of entropy. Thermal contact with the heat sink is then broken so that the system is insulated, and the magnetic field is switched off. This increases the heat capacity of the refrigerant, thus decreasing its temperature below the temperature of the heat sink.\n\nBecause few materials exhibit the needed properties at room temperature, applications have so far been limited to [[cryogenics]] and research.\n\n===Other methods===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nOther methods of refrigeration include the [[air cycle machine]] used in aircraft; the [[vortex tube]] used for spot cooling, when compressed air is available; and [[thermoacoustic refrigeration]] using sound waves in a pressurized gas to drive heat transfer and heat exchange; [[steam jet cooling]] popular in the early 1930s for air conditioning large buildings; thermoelastic cooling using a smart metal alloy stretching and relaxing. Many [[Stirling cycle]] heat engines can be run backwards to act as a refrigerator, and therefore these engines have a niche use in [[cryogenics]]. In addition there are other types of [[cryocoolers]] such as Gifford-McMahon coolers, Joule-Thomson coolers, [[Pulse tube refrigerator|pulse-tube refrigerators]] and, for temperatures between 2 mK and 500 mK, [[dilution refrigerator]]s.\n\n===Elastocaloric refrigeration===\nAnother potential solid-state refrigeration technique and a relatively new area of study comes from a special property of [[pseudoelasticity|super elastic]] materials. These materials undergo a temperature change when experiencing an applied mechanical [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] (called the elastocaloric effect). Since super elastic materials deform reversibly at high [[strain (mechanics)|strains]], the material experiences a flattened [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] region in its [[stress-strain curve]] caused by a resulting phase transformation from an [[austenite|austenitic]] to a [[martensite|martensitic]] crystal phase.\n\nWhen a super elastic material experiences a stress in the austenitic phase, it undergoes an [[exothermic]] [[phase transition|phase transformation]] to the martensitic phase, which causes the material to heat up. Removing the stress reverses the process, restores the material to its austenitic phase, and [[endothermic process|absorbs heat]] from the surroundings cooling down the material.\n\nThe most appealing part of this research is how potentially energy efficient and environmentally friendly this cooling technology is. The different materials used, commonly [[shape-memory alloy]]s, provide a non-toxic source of emission free refrigeration. The most commonly studied materials studied are shape-memory alloys, like [[nitinol]] and Cu-Zn-Al. Nitinol is of the more promising alloys with output heat at about 66 J/cm<sup>3</sup> and a temperature change of about 16\u201320 K.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tu\u0161ek|first1=J.|last2=Engelbrecht|first2=K.|last3=Mikkelsen|first3=L.P.|last4=Pryds|first4=N.|title=Elastocaloric effect of Ni-Ti wire for application in a cooling device|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=February 2015|volume=117|issue=12|pages=124901|doi=10.1063/1.4913878|accessdate=|bibcode=2015JAP...117l4901T|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/elastocaloric-effect-of-niti-wire-for-application-in-a-cooling-device(dcba0d01-f845-4210-9ea7-62e269e281bd).html}}</ref> Due to the difficulty in manufacturing some of the shape memory alloys, alternative materials like [[natural rubber]] have been studied. Even though rubber may not give off as much heat per volume (12 J/cm<sup>3</sup> ) as the shape memory alloys, it still generates a comparable temperature change of about 12 K and operates at a suitable temperature range, low stresses, and low cost.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=Zhongjian|last2=Sebald|first2=Gael|last3=Guyomar|first3=Daniel|title=Temperature dependence of the elastocaloric effect in natural rubber|journal=Physics Letters A|date=21 February 2017|volume=381|issue=25\u201326|pages=2112\u20132116|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2017.02.014|accessdate=|arxiv=1604.02686|bibcode=2017PhLA..381.2112X}}</ref>\n\nThe main challenge however comes from potential energy losses in the form of [[hysteresis]], often associated with this process. Since most of these losses comes from incompatibilities between the two phases, proper alloy tuning is necessary to reduce losses and increase reversibility and [[energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]]. Balancing the transformation strain of the material with the energy losses enables a large elastocaloric effect to occur and potentially a new alternative for refrigeration.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=Benfeng|last2=Liu|first2=Jian|title=Elastocaloric effect and superelastic stability in Ni\u2013Mn\u2013In\u2013Co polycrystalline Heusler alloys: hysteresis and strain-rate effects|journal=Scientific Reports|date=18 May 2017|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2084|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-02300-3|pmid=28522819|pmc=5437036|accessdate=|bibcode=2017NatSR...7.2084L}}</ref>\n\n===Fridge Gate===\nThe Fridge Gate method is a theoretical application of using a single logic gate to drive a refrigerator in the most energy efficient way possible without violating the laws of thermodynamics. It operates on the fact that there are two energy states in which a particle can exist: the ground state and the excited state. The excited state carries a little more energy than the ground state, small enough so that the transition occurs with high probability. There are three components or particle types associated with the fridge gate. The first is on the interior of the fridge, the second on the outside and the third is connected to a power supply which heats up every so often that it can reach the E state and replenish the source. In the cooling step on the inside of the fridge, the g state particle absorbs energy from ambient particles, cooling them, and itself jumping to the e state. In the second step, on the outside of the fridge where the particles are also at an e state, the particle falls to the g state, releasing energy and heating the outside particles. In the third and final step, the power supply moves a particle at the e state, and when it falls to the g state it induces an energy-neutral swap where the interior e particle is replaced by a new g particle, restarting the cycle.<ref>{{cite journal\n|title= Thermodynamics: The fridge gate\n|author= Renato Renner\n|journal= Nature\n|volume= 482\n|issue= 7384\n|date= 9 February 2012\n|pages= 164\u2013165\n|doi= 10.1038/482164a\n|pmid= 22318595\n|bibcode= 2012Natur.482..164R\n}}</ref>\n\n===Passive systems===\nMIT researchers have devised a new way of providing cooling on a hot sunny day, using inexpensive materials and requiring no fossil fuel-generated power. The passive system, which could be used to supplement other cooling systems to preserve food and medications in hot, off-grid locations, is essentially a high-tech version of a parasol.<ref>{{cite web |title=A new way to provide cooling without power |url=https://news.mit.edu/2018/device-provides-cooling-without-power-1128 |website=MIT News |accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Capacity ratings==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe measured capacity of refrigeration is always dimensioned in units of [[power (physics)|power]]. Domestic and commercial refrigerators may be rated in kJ/s, or Btu/h of cooling. For commercial and industrial refrigeration systems, the '''kilowatt''' (kW) is the basic unit of refrigeration{{and}}except in North America, where the '''[[ton of refrigeration]]''' (TR) is used. (Nominally the capacity to freeze one [[short ton]] of water per day, the TR is defined as 12,000 Btu/hr (3.517&nbsp;kW).)\n\nA refrigeration system's '''[[coefficient of performance]]''' (CoP) is very important in determining a system's overall efficiency. It is defined as refrigeration capacity in kW divided by the energy input in kW. While CoP is a very simple measure of performance, it is typically not used for industrial refrigeration in North America. Owners and manufacturers of these systems typically use '''performance factor''' (PF). A system's PF is defined as a system's energy input in horsepower divided by its refrigeration capacity in TR. Both CoP and PF can be applied to either the entire system or to system components. For example, an individual compressor can be rated by comparing the energy needed to run the compressor versus the expected refrigeration capacity based on inlet volume flow rate. It is important to note that both CoP and PF for a refrigeration system are only defined at specific operating conditions, including temperatures and thermal loads. Moving away from the specified operating conditions can dramatically change a system's performance.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Air conditioning]]\n*[[Auto-defrost]]\n*[[Beef ring]]\n*[[Carnot heat engine]]\n*[[Cold chain]]\n*[[Coolgardie safe]]\n*[[Cryocooler]]\n*[[Darcy friction factor formulae]]\n*[[Einstein refrigerator]]\n*[[Freezer]]\n*[[Heat pump]]\n*[[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle]]\n*[[Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning]] (HVAC, HVACR)\n*[[Icebox]]\n*[[Icyball]]\n*[[Joule\u2013Thomson effect]]\n*[[Laser cooling]]\n*[[Pot-in-pot refrigerator]]\n*[[Pumpable ice technology]]\n*[[Quantum refrigerators]]\n*[[Redundant refrigeration system]]\n*[[Reefer ship]]\n*[[Refrigerant]]\n*[[Refrigerated container]]\n*[[Refrigerator]]\n*[[Refrigerator car]]\n*[[Refrigerator truck]]\n*[[Seasonal energy efficiency ratio]] (SEER)\n*[[Steam jet cooling]]\n*[[Thermoacoustics]]\n*[[Vapor-compression refrigeration]]\n*[[Working fluid]]\n*[[World Refrigeration Day]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Refrigeration volume'', [[ASHRAE Handbook]], ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA\n*Stoecker and Jones, ''Refrigeration and Air Conditioning'', Tata-McGraw Hill Publishers\n*Mathur, M.L., Mehta, F.S., ''Thermal Engineering'' Vol II\n*MSN Encarta Encyclopedia\n*{{cite book|author1=Andrew D.

In other words, refrigeration is artificial (human-made) [[cooling]].<ref>International Dictionary of Refrigeration, http://dictionary.iifiir.org/search.php</ref><ref>ASHRAE Terminology, https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/free-resources/ashrae-terminology</ref> Energy in the form of heat is removed from a low-temperature reservoir and transferred to a high-temperature reservoir. The work of energy transfer is traditionally driven by [[work (physics)|mechanical]] means, but can also be driven by heat, [[magnetism]], [[electricity]], [[laser cooling|laser]], or other means. Refrigeration has many applications, including household [[refrigerator]]s, industrial [[freezer]]s, [[cryogenics]], and [[air conditioning]]. [[Heat pump]]s may use the heat output of the refrigeration process, and also may be designed to be reversible, but are otherwise similar to air conditioning units.\n\nRefrigeration has had a large impact on industry, lifestyle, agriculture, and settlement patterns. The idea of preserving food dates back to at least the ancient Roman and Chinese empires. However, mechanical refrigeration technology has rapidly evolved in the last century, from [[ice harvesting]] to [[Refrigerator car|temperature-controlled rail cars]]. The introduction of refrigerated rail cars contributed to the westward expansion of the United States, allowing settlement in areas that were not on main transport channels such as rivers, harbors, or valley trails. Settlements were also developing in infertile parts of the country, filled with newly discovered natural resources.\n\nThese new settlement patterns sparked the building of large cities which are able to thrive in areas that were otherwise thought to be inhospitable, such as [[Houston]], Texas, and [[Las Vegas]], Nevada. In most developed countries, cities are heavily dependent upon refrigeration in [[Supermarket|supermarkets]] in order to obtain their food for daily consumption. The increase in food sources has led to a larger concentration of agricultural sales coming from a smaller percentage of farms. Farms today have a much larger output per person in comparison to the late 1800s. This has resulted in new food sources available to entire populations, which has had a large impact on the nutrition of society.\n\nAs quite similar criteria shall be fulfilled by [[working fluid]]s ([[refrigerant]]s) applied to heat pumps, refrigeration, and [[organic Rankine cycle]]s; several working fluids are applied by these technologies. Ammonia was one of the first refrigerants. Refrigeration can be defined as \"The science of providing and maintaining temperature below that of surrounding atmosphere\". It is the continuous extraction of heat from a body.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of low-temperature technology}}\n\n===Earliest forms of cooling===\nThe seasonal harvesting of snow and ice is an ancient practice estimated to have begun earlier than 1000 BC.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last=Neuburger|first=Albert|title=The technical arts and sciences of the ancients|year=2003|publisher=Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=978-0-7103-0755-2|page=122}}</ref> A Chinese collection of lyrics from this time period known as the ''[[Shijing]]'', describes religious ceremonies for filling and emptying ice cellars. However, little is known about the construction of these ice cellars or what the ice was used for. The next ancient society to record the harvesting of ice may have been the Jews in the book of Proverbs, which reads, \u201cAs the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them who sent him.\u201d Historians have interpreted this to mean that the Jews used ice to cool beverages rather than to preserve food. Other ancient cultures such as the Greeks and the Romans dug large snow pits insulated with grass, chaff, or branches of trees as cold storage. Like the Jews, the Greeks and Romans did not use ice and snow to preserve food, but primarily as a means to cool beverages. The Egyptians also developed methods to cool beverages, but in lieu of using ice to cool water, the Egyptians cooled water by putting boiling water in shallow earthen jars and placing them on the roofs of their houses at night. Slaves would moisten the outside of the jars and the resulting evaporation would cool the water. The ancient people of India used this same concept to produce ice. The Persians stored ice in a pit called a [[Yakhchal]] and may have been the first group of people to use cold storage to preserve food. In the Australian outback before a reliable electricity supply was available where the weather could be hot and dry, many farmers used a [[Coolgardie safe]]. This consisted of a room with [[hessian fabric|hessian]] (burlap) curtains hanging from the ceiling soaked in water. The water would evaporate and thereby cool the hessian curtains and thereby the air circulating in the room. This would allow many perishables such as fruit, butter, and cured meats to be kept that would normally spoil in the heat.<ref>{{cite book|last=Neuburger|first=Albert|title=The technical arts and sciences of the ancients|year=2003|publisher=Kegan Paul|location=London|isbn=978-0-7103-0755-2|pages=122\u2013124}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=5\u20136}}</ref>\n\n===Ice harvesting===\n{{See also|Ice cutting|Ice trade}}\n[[File:Ice Harvesting, Massachusetts, early 1850s.jpg|thumb|Ice harvesting in [[Massachusetts]], 1852, showing the [[railroad]] line in the background, used to transport the ice.]]\nBefore 1830, few Americans used ice to refrigerate foods due to a lack of ice-storehouses and iceboxes.

In the beginning, Tudor lost thousands of dollars, but eventually turned a profit as he constructed icehouses in Charleston, Virginia and in the Cuban port town of Havana. These icehouses as well as better insulated ships helped reduce ice wastage from 66% to 8%. This efficiency gain influenced Tudor to expand his ice market to other towns with icehouses such as New Orleans and Savannah. This ice market further expanded as harvesting ice became faster and cheaper after one of Tudor's suppliers, Nathaniel Wyeth, invented a horse-drawn ice cutter in 1825. This invention as well as Tudor's success inspired others to get involved in the [[ice trade]] and the ice industry grew.\n\nIce became a mass-market commodity by the early 1830s with the price of ice dropping from six cents per pound to a half of a cent per pound. In New York City, ice consumption increased from 12,000 tons in 1843 to 100,000 tons in 1856. Boston's consumption leapt from 6,000 tons to 85,000 tons during that same period. Ice harvesting created a \u201ccooling culture\u201d as majority of people used ice and iceboxes to store their dairy products, fish, meat, and even fruits and vegetables. These early cold storage practices paved the way for many Americans to accept the refrigeration technology that would soon take over the country.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=11\u201313}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=20\u201323|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref>\n\n===Refrigeration research===\n[[File:William Cullen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Cullen]], the first to conduct experiments into artificial refrigeration.]]\nThe history of artificial refrigeration began when Scottish professor [[William Cullen]] designed a small refrigerating machine in 1755.

They confirmed that the evaporation of highly volatile liquids, such as alcohol and ether, could be used to drive down the temperature of an object past the freezing point of water. They conducted their experiment with the bulb of a mercury thermometer as their object and with a bellows used to quicken the evaporation; they lowered the temperature of the thermometer bulb down to {{convert|7|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}, while the ambient temperature was {{convert|65|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.

It was a closed-cycle that could operate continuously, as he described in his patent:\n:I am enabled to use volatile fluids for the purpose of producing the cooling or freezing of fluids, and yet at the same time constantly condensing such volatile fluids, and bringing them again into operation without waste.\n\nHis prototype system worked although it did not succeed commercially.<ref name=burstall>{{cite book |last= Burstall |first= Aubrey F. |year= 1965 |title= A History of Mechanical Engineering |publisher= The MIT Press |isbn= 978-0-262-52001-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1842, a similar attempt was made by American physician, [[John Gorrie]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00008080&homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D0008080.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F0008080%2526RS%3DPN%2F0008080&PageNum=&Rtype=&SectionNum=&idkey=NONE&Input=View+first+page|title=Patent Images}}</ref> who built a working prototype, but it was a commercial failure.

American engineer [[Alexander Twining]] took out a British patent in 1850 for a vapour compression system that used ether.\n\nThe first practical vapour-compression refrigeration system was built by [[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]], a British journalist who had emigrated to [[Australia]]. His 1856 patent was for a vapour-compression system using ether, alcohol, or ammonia. He built a mechanical ice-making machine in 1851 on the banks of the Barwon River at Rocky Point in [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and his first commercial ice-making machine followed in 1854. Harrison also introduced commercial vapour-compression refrigeration to breweries and meat-packing houses, and by 1861, a dozen of his systems were in operation. He later entered the debate of how to compete against the American advantage of unrefrigerated [[beef]] sales to the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1873 he prepared the sailing ship ''Norfolk'' for an experimental beef shipment to the United Kingdom, which used a cold room system instead of a refrigeration system. The venture was a failure as the ice was consumed faster than expected.\n\n[[File:AppareilCarr\u00e9.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ferdinand Carr\u00e9]]'s ice-making device]]\nThe first [[absorption refrigeration|gas absorption]] refrigeration system using gaseous ammonia dissolved in water (referred to as \"aqua ammonia\") was developed by [[Ferdinand Carr\u00e9]] of France in 1859 and patented in 1860.

His \"Compression Ice Machine\" would revolutionize the cold-storage industry. In 1869 other investors and he purchased an old steamship onto which they loaded one of Lowe's refrigeration units and began shipping fresh fruit from New York to the Gulf Coast area, and fresh meat from Galveston, Texas back to New York, but because of Lowe's lack of knowledge about shipping, the business was a costly failure.\n\n===Commercial use===\n{{See also|Refrigerator}}\n[[File:Early refrigerator car design circa 1870.jpg|thumb|An 1870 refrigerator car design.

Although it was a commercial failure, it inspired scientists and inventors around the world. France's Ferdinand Carre was one of the inspired and he created an ice producing system that was simpler and smaller than that of Gorrie. During the Civil War, cities such as New Orleans could no longer get ice from New England via the coastal ice trade. Carre's refrigeration system became the solution to New Orleans ice problems and by 1865 the city had three of Carre's machines.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=25}}</ref> In 1867, in San Antonio, Texas, a French immigrant named Andrew Muhl built an ice-making machine to help service the expanding beef industry before moving it to Waco in 1871. In 1873, the patent for this machine was contracted by the Columbus Iron Works, a company acquired by the W.C. Bradley Co., which went on to produce the first commercial ice-makers in the US.\n\nBy the 1870s breweries had become the largest users of harvested ice. Though the ice-harvesting industry had grown immensely by the turn of the 20th century, pollution and sewage had begun to creep into natural ice, making it a problem in the metropolitan suburbs. Eventually, breweries began to complain of tainted ice. Public concern for the purity of water, from which ice was formed, began to increase in the early 1900s with the rise of germ theory. Numerous media outlets published articles connecting diseases such as typhoid fever with natural ice consumption. This caused ice harvesting to become illegal in certain areas of the country. All of these scenarios increased the demands for modern refrigeration and manufactured ice. Ice producing machines like that of Carre's and Muhl's were looked to as means of producing ice to meet the needs of grocers, farmers, and food shippers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=25|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=110\u2013111}}</ref>\n\nRefrigerated railroad cars were introduced in the US in the 1840s for short-run transport of dairy products, but these used harvested ice to maintain a cool temperature.<ref>[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/dqr01 Refrigeration], Texas State Historical Association.</ref>\n\n[[File:SS Dunedin by Frederick Tudgay.JPG|thumb|left|[[Dunedin (ship)|''Dunedin'']], the first commercially successful refrigerated ship.]]\nThe new refrigerating technology first met with widespread industrial use as a means to freeze meat supplies for transport by sea in [[reefer ship]]s from the British [[Dominion]]s and other countries to the [[British Isles]]. The first to achieve this breakthrough was an entrepreneur who had emigrated to [[New Zealand]]. [[William Soltau Davidson]] thought that Britain's rising population and meat demand could mitigate the slump in world [[wool]] markets that was heavily affecting New Zealand. After extensive research, he commissioned the [[Dunedin (ship)|''Dunedin'']] to be refitted with a compression refrigeration unit for meat shipment in 1881. On February 15, 1882, the ''Dunedin'' sailed for London with what was to be the first commercially successful refrigerated shipping voyage, and the foundation of the refrigerated meat industry.<ref>{{cite book|title=A lasting Legacy \u2013 A 125 year history of New Zealand Farming since the first Frozen Meat Shipment|author=Colin Williscroft|publisher=NZ Rural Press Limited|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VTrmMQAACAAJ}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Times]]'' commented \"Today we have to record such a triumph over physical difficulties, as would have been incredible, even unimaginable, a very few days ago...\". The ''[[Marlborough (1876 ship)|Marlborough]]''\u2014sister ship to the ''Dunedin'' \u2013 was immediately converted and joined the trade the following year, along with the rival New Zealand Shipping Company vessel ''Mataurua'', while the German Steamer ''Marsala'' began carrying frozen New Zealand lamb in December 1882. Within five years, 172 shipments of frozen meat were sent from New Zealand to the United Kingdom, of which only 9 had significant amounts of meat condemned. Refrigerated shipping also led to a broader meat and dairy boom in [[Australasia]] and South America. [[J & E Hall]] of [[Dartford]], England outfitted the 'SS Selembria' with a vapor compression system to bring 30,000 carcasses of [[mutton]] from the [[Falkland Islands]] in 1886.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jehall.com/about-jeh-group/history|title=Our History &#124; Refrigeration Solutions &#124; J&E Hall|website=www.jehall.com}}</ref> In the years ahead, the industry rapidly expanded to Australia, Argentina and the United States.\n\nBy the 1890s refrigeration played a vital role in the distribution of food. The meat-packing industry relied heavily on natural ice in the 1880s and continued to rely on manufactured ice as those technologies became available.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=142|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref> By 1900, the meat-packing houses of Chicago had adopted ammonia-cycle commercial refrigeration. By 1914 almost every location used artificial refrigeration. The [[Meat packing industry#Meatpackers|major meat packers]], Armour, Swift, and Wilson, had purchased the most expensive units which they installed on train cars and in branch houses and storage facilities in the more remote distribution areas.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, refrigeration units were designed for installation on trucks or lorries. Refrigerated vehicles are used to transport perishable goods, such as frozen foods, fruit and vegetables, and temperature-sensitive chemicals. Most modern refrigerators keep the temperature between \u201340 and \u201320&nbsp;\u00b0C, and have a maximum payload of around 24,000&nbsp;kg gross weight (in Europe).\n\nAlthough commercial refrigeration quickly progressed, it had limitations that prevented it from moving into the household. First, most refrigerators were far too large. Some of the commercial units being used in 1910 weighed between five and two hundred tons. Second, commercial refrigerators were expensive to produce, purchase, and maintain. Lastly, these refrigerators were unsafe. It was not uncommon for commercial refrigerators to catch fire, explode, or leak toxic gases. Refrigeration did not become a household technology until these three challenges were overcome.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=38|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref>\n\n===Home and consumer use===\n[[File:Early household refrigerator in Popular Science 1919.png|thumb|An early example of the [[consumerization]] of mechanical refrigeration that began in the early 20th century. The [[refrigerant]] was [[sulfur dioxide]].]]\n[[File:Food into a refrigerator - 20111002.jpg|thumb|A modern home refrigerator]]\n\nDuring the early 1800s consumers preserved their food by storing food and ice purchased from ice harvesters in iceboxes. In 1803, Thomas Moore patented a metal-lined butter-storage tub which became the prototype for most iceboxes. These iceboxes were used until nearly 1910 and the technology did not progress. In fact, consumers that used the icebox in 1910 faced the same challenge of a moldy and stinky icebox that consumers had in the early 1800s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=23, 38|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref>\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) was one of the first companies to overcome these challenges. In 1911 GE released a household refrigeration unit that was powered by gas. The use of gas eliminated the need for an electric compressor motor and decreased the size of the refrigerator. However, electric companies that were customers of GE did not benefit from a gas-powered unit. Thus, GE invested in developing an electric model. In 1927, GE released the Monitor Top, the first refrigerator to run on electricity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=43\u201345|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Frigidaire, one of GE's main competitors, synthesized [[Freon]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=44|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref> With the invention of synthetic refrigerants based mostly on a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) chemical, safer refrigerators were possible for home and consumer use. Freon led to the development of smaller, lighter, and cheaper refrigerators. The average price of a refrigerator dropped from $275 to $154 with the synthesis of Freon. This lower price allowed ownership of refrigerators in American households to exceed 50%.<ref>{{cite book|last=Freidberg|first=Susanne|title=Fresh: a perishable history|year=2010|publisher=Belknap|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=978-0-674-05722-7|pages=45|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}</ref> Freon is a trademark of the DuPont Corporation and refers to these CFCs, and later hydro chlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) and hydro fluorocarbon (HFC), refrigerants developed in the late 1920s. These refrigerants were considered at the time to be less harmful than the commonly-used refrigerants of the time, including methyl formate, ammonia, methyl chloride, and sulfur dioxide. The intent was to provide refrigeration equipment for home use without danger. These CFC refrigerants answered that need. In the 1970s, though, the compounds were found to be reacting with atmospheric ozone, an important protection against solar ultraviolet radiation, and their use as a refrigerant worldwide was curtailed in the Montreal Protocol of 1987.\n\n==Impact on settlement patterns==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn the last century refrigeration allowed new settlement patterns to emerge. This new technology has allowed for new areas to be settled that are not on a natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbor that may have otherwise not been settled. Refrigeration has given opportunities to early settlers to expand westward and into rural areas that were unpopulated. These new settlers with rich and untapped soil saw opportunity to profit by sending raw goods to the eastern cities and states. In the 20th century, refrigeration has made \u201cGalactic Cities\u201d such as Dallas, Phoenix and Los Angeles possible.\n\n===Refrigerated rail cars===\nThe refrigerated rail car ([[refrigerated van]] or [[refrigerator car]]), along with the dense railroad network, became an exceedingly important link between the marketplace and the farm allowing for a national opportunity rather than a just a regional one. Before the invention of the refrigerated rail car it was impossible to ship perishable food products long distances. The beef packing industry made the first demand push for refrigeration cars. The railroad companies were slow to adopt this new invention because of their heavy investments in cattle cars, stockyards, and feedlots.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=2}}</ref> Refrigeration cars were also complex and costly compared to other rail cars, which also slowed the adoption of the refrigerated rail car. After the slow adoption of the refrigerated car, the beef packing industry dominated the refrigerated rail car business with their ability to control ice plants and the setting of icing fees. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated that in 1916 over sixty-nine percent of the cattle killed in the country was done in plants involved in interstate trade. The same companies that were also involved in the meat trade later implemented refrigerated transport to include vegetables and fruit. The meat packing companies had much of the expensive machinery, such as refrigerated cars, and cold storage facilities that allowed for them to effectively distribute all types of perishable goods. During World War I, a national refrigerator car pool was established by the United States Administration to deal with problem of idle cars and was later continued after the war.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=}}</ref> The idle car problem was the problem of refrigeration cars sitting pointlessly in between seasonal harvests. This meant that very expensive cars sat in rail yards for a good portion of the year while making no revenue for the car's owner. The car pool was a system where cars were distributed to areas as crops matured ensuring maximum use of the cars. Refrigerated rail cars moved eastward from vineyards, orchards, fields, and gardens in western states to satisfy Americas consuming market in the east.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=3}}</ref> The refrigerated car made it possible to transport perishable crops hundreds and even thousands of miles. The most noticeable effect the car gave was a regional specialization of vegetables and fruits. The refrigeration rail car was widely used for the transportation of perishable goods up until the 1950s. By the 1960s the nation's interstate highway system was adequately complete allowing for trucks to carry the majority of the perishable food loads and to push out the old system of the refrigerated rail cars.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stover|first=J.|title=American Railroads|journal=The Chicago History of the Railroad Refrigerator Car|year=1970|pages=214}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion west and into rural areas===\nThe widespread use of refrigeration allowed for a vast amount of new agricultural opportunities to open up in the United States. New markets emerged throughout the United States in areas that were previously uninhabited and far-removed from heavily populated areas. New agricultural opportunity presented itself in areas that were considered rural such as states in the south and in the west. Shipments on a large scale from the south and California were both made around the same time although natural ice was used from the Sierras in California rather than manufactured ice in the south.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Danes-Wingett|first=Lind|title=The Ice Car Cometh: A History of the Refrigerated Rail Car|journal=The San Joaquin Historian|volume=10|issue=4|pages=7}}</ref> Refrigeration allowed for many areas to specialize in the growing of specific fruits. California specialized in several fruits, grapes, peaches, pears, plums, and apples while Georgia became famous for specifically its peaches. In California, the acceptance of the refrigerated rail carts lead to an increase of car loads from 4,500 carloads in 1895 to between 8,000 and 10,000 carloads in 1905.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=156}}</ref> The Gulf States, Arkansas, Missouri and Tennessee entered into strawberry production on a large-scale while Mississippi became the center of the [[tomato industry]]. New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Nevada grew cantaloupes. Without refrigeration this would have not been possible. By 1917, well-established fruit and vegetable areas that were close to eastern markets felt the pressure of competition from these distant specialized centers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=158}}</ref> Refrigeration was not limited to meat, fruit and vegetables but it also encompassed dairy product and dairy farms. In the early twentieth century large cities got their dairy supply from farms as far as 400 miles.

Refrigeration made production possible in the west far from eastern markets, so much in fact that dairy farmers could pay transportation cost and still undersell their eastern competitors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Oscar Edward|title=Refrigeration in America; a history of a new technology and its impact|year=1953|publisher=Published for the University of Cincinnati by Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-8046-1621-8|pages=168}}</ref> Refrigeration and the refrigerated rail gave opportunity to areas with rich soil far from natural channel of transport such as a river, valley trail or harbors.<ref name=\"Schimd\">{{cite web|last=Schimd|first=A.|title=The Economics of Population Settlement: Cost of Alternative Growth Patterns|url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/Extension/ncrcrd/NCRCRD-rrd172-print.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Rise of the galactic city===\n\"Edge city\" was a term coined by [[Joel Garreau]], whereas the term \"galactic city\" was coined by [[Lewis Mumford]]. These terms refer to a concentration of business, shopping, and entertainment outside a traditional downtown or central business district in what had previously been a residential or rural area. There were several factors contributing to the growth of these cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston, and Phoenix. The factors that contributed to these large cities include reliable automobiles, highway systems, refrigeration, and agricultural production increases. Large cities such as the ones mentioned above have not been uncommon in history but what separates these cities from the rest are that these cities are not along some natural channel of transport, or at some crossroad of two or more channels such as a trail, harbor, mountain, river, or valley. These large cities have been developed in areas that only a few hundred years ago would have been uninhabitable. Without a cost efficient way of cooling air and transporting water and food great distances these large cities would have never developed. The rapid growth of these cities was influenced by refrigeration and an agricultural productivity increase, allowing more distant farms to effectively feed the population.<ref name=\"Schimd\"/>\n\n==Impact on agriculture and food production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nAgriculture's role in developed countries has drastically changed in the last century due to many factors, including refrigeration. Statistics from the 2007 census gives information on the large concentration of agricultural sales coming from a small portion of the existing farms in the United States today. This is a partial result of the market created for the frozen meat trade by the first successful shipment of frozen sheep carcasses coming from New Zealand in the 1880s. As the market continued to grow, regulations on food processing and quality began to be enforced. Eventually, electricity was introduced into rural homes in the United States, which allowed refrigeration technology to continue to expand on the farm, increasing output per person. Today, refrigeration's use on the farm reduces humidity levels, avoids spoiling due to bacterial growth, and assists in preservation.\n\n===Demographics===\nThe introduction of refrigeration and evolution of additional technologies drastically changed agriculture in the United States. During the beginning of the 20th century, farming was a common occupation and lifestyle for United States citizens, as most farmers actually lived on their farm. In 1935, there were 6.8 million farms in the United States and a population of 127 million. Yet, while the United States population has continued to climb, citizens pursuing agriculture continue to decline. Based on the 2007 US Census, less than one percent of a population of 310 million people claim farming as an occupation today. However, the increasing population has led to an increasing demand for agricultural products, which is met through a greater variety of crops, fertilizers, pesticides, and improved technology. Improved technology has decreased the risk and time involved if agricultural management and allows larger farms to increase their output per person to meet society's demand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Demographics|url=http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/ag101/demographics.html|date=2015-03-19}}</ref>\n\n===Meat packing and trade===\nPrior to 1882, the [[South Island]] of New Zealand had been experimenting with sowing grass and crossbreeding sheep, which immediately gave their farmers economic potential in the exportation of meat. In 1882, the first successful shipment of sheep carcasses was sent from [[Port Chalmers]] in [[Dunedin]], New Zealand, to [[London]]. By the 1890s, the frozen meat trade became increasingly more profitable in New Zealand, especially in [[Canterbury]], where 50% of exported sheep carcasses came from in 1900. It wasn't long before Canterbury meat was known for the highest quality, creating a demand for New Zealand meat around the world. In order to meet this new demand, the farmers improved their feed so sheep could be ready for the slaughter in only seven months. This new method of shipping led to an economic boom in New Zealand by the mid 1890s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peden|first=R.|title=Farming in the Economy-Refrigeration and Sheep Farming|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/farming-in-the-economy/page-3}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the Meat Inspection Act of 1891 was put in place in the United States because local butchers felt the refrigerated railcar system was unwholesome.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Libecap|title=The Rise of the Chicago Meat Packers and the Origins of Meat Inspection and Antitrust|journal=Economic Inquiry |volume=30|pages=242\u2013262|doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.1992.tb01656.x|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/h0029.pdf}}</ref> When meat packing began to take off, consumers became nervous about the quality of the meat for consumption. [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' brought negative attention to the meat packing industry, by drawing to light unsanitary working conditions and processing of diseased animals. The book caught the attention of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and [[Federal Meat Inspection Act|the 1906 Meat Inspection Act]] was put into place as an amendment to the Meat Inspection Act of 1891. This new act focused on the quality of the meat and environment it is processed in.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rockoff|first=Gary M.

At the time, power companies did not feel that extending power to rural areas ([[rural electrification]]) would produce enough profit to make it worth their while. However, in the midst of the [[Great Depression]], President Franklin D. Roosevelt realized that rural areas would continue to lag behind urban areas in both poverty and production if they were not electrically wired. On May 11, 1935, the president signed an executive order called the Rural Electrification Administration, also known as REA. The agency provided loans to fund electric infrastructure in the rural areas. In just a few years, 300,000 people in rural areas of the United States had received power in their homes.\n\nWhile electricity dramatically improved working conditions on farms, it also had a large impact on the safety of food production. Refrigeration systems were introduced to the farming and [[food distribution]] processes, which helped in [[food preservation]] and [[food safety|kept food supplies safe]]. Refrigeration also allowed for production of perishable commodities, which could then be shipped throughout the United States.

Refrigeration systems are used the heaviest in the warmer months for farming produce, which must be cooled as soon as possible in order to meet quality standards and increase the shelf life. Meanwhile, dairy farms refrigerate milk year round to avoid spoiling.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beard|first=R.|title=Energy-Efficient Refrigeration for Farms|url=https://farm-energy.extension.org/energy-efficient-refrigeration-for-farms/}}</ref>\n\n==Effects on lifestyle and diet==\nIn the late 19th Century and into the very early 20th Century, except for staple foods (sugar, rice, and beans) that needed no refrigeration, the available foods were affected heavily by the seasons and what could be grown locally.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stelpflug|first=E|title=The Food Industry and the Part That Refrigeration Plays in It|journal=Financial Analysts Journal|volume=6|issue=4|pages=37\u201339|doi=10.2469/faj.v6.n4.37|year=1950}}</ref> Refrigeration has removed these limitations. Refrigeration played a large part in the feasibility and then popularity of the modern supermarket.

The change in our method of food preservation moved us away from salts to a more manageable sodium level. The ability to move and store perishables such as meat and dairy led to a 1.7% increase in dairy consumption and overall protein intake by 1.25% annually in the US after the 1890s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=L. |author2=Goodwin B. |author3=Grennes T.|title=The Effect of Mechanical Refrigeration on Nutrition in the United States|journal=Social Science History|volume=28|issue=2|pages=325\u2013336|doi=10.1215/01455532-28-2-325|year=2004}}</ref>\n\nPeople were not only consuming these perishables because it became easier for they themselves to store them, but because the innovations in refrigerated transportation and storage led to less spoilage and waste, thereby driving the prices of these products down. Refrigeration accounts for at least 5.1% of the increase in adult stature (in the US) through improved nutrition, and when the indirect effects associated with improvements in the quality of nutrients and the reduction in illness is additionally factored in, the overall impact becomes considerably larger. Recent studies have also shown a negative relationship between the number of refrigerators in a household and the rate of gastric cancer mortality.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Park|first=B. |author2=Shin A. |author3=Yoo, K.|title=Ecological Study for Refrigerator Use, Salt, Vegetable, and Fruit Intakes, and Gastric Cancer|journal=Cancer Causes & Control|volume=22|issue=11|pages=1497\u20131502|doi=10.1007/s10552-011-9823-7|pmid=21805052 |display-authors=etal|year=2011}}</ref>\n\n==Current applications of refrigeration==\nProbably the most widely used current applications of refrigeration are for [[air conditioning]] of private homes and public buildings, and refrigerating foodstuffs in homes, restaurants and large storage warehouses.

''BBC''. 30 April 2008</ref>\n\nIn commerce and manufacturing, there are many uses for refrigeration. Refrigeration is used to liquefy gases \u2013 [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[propane]], and [[methane]], for example. In compressed air purification, it is used to [[condensation|condense]] water vapor from compressed air to reduce its moisture content. In [[oil refinery|oil refineries]], [[chemical plant]]s, and [[petrochemical]] plants, refrigeration is used to maintain certain processes at their needed low temperatures (for example, in [[alkylation]] of [[butene]]s and [[butane]] to produce a high-[[octane rating|octane]] gasoline component). Metal workers use refrigeration to temper steel and cutlery. When transporting temperature-sensitive foodstuffs and other materials by trucks, trains, airplanes and seagoing vessels, refrigeration is a necessity.\n\nDairy products are constantly in need of refrigeration, and it was only discovered in the past few decades that eggs needed to be refrigerated during shipment rather than waiting to be refrigerated after arrival at the grocery store. Meats, poultry and fish all must be kept in climate-controlled environments before being sold. Refrigeration also helps keep fruits and vegetables edible longer.\n\nOne of the most influential uses of refrigeration was in the development of the [[sushi]]/[[sashimi]] industry in Japan. Before the discovery of refrigeration, many sushi connoisseurs were at risk of contracting diseases. The dangers of unrefrigerated sashimi were not brought to light for decades due to the lack of research and healthcare distribution across rural Japan. Around mid-century, the [[Zojirushi]] corporation, based in Kyoto, made breakthroughs in refrigerator designs, making refrigerators cheaper and more accessible for restaurant proprietors and the general public.\n\n==Methods of refrigeration==\nMethods of refrigeration can be classified as ''non-cyclic'', ''cyclic'', ''thermoelectric'' and ''magnetic''.\n\n===Non-cyclic refrigeration===\n{{Main|Ice trade}}\nThis refrigeration method cools a contained area by melting ice, or by sublimating [[dry ice]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url= https://www.brighthubengineering.com/hvac/20353-methods-of-refrigeration-ice-refrigeration-and-dry-ice-refrigeration/\n|title= Methods of Refrigeration: Ice Refrigeration, Dry Ice Refrigeration\n|website= Brighthub Engineering\n|access-date= 2016-02-29\n|date= 2008-12-22\n}}</ref> Perhaps the simplest example of this is a portable cooler, where items are put in it, then ice is poured over the top. Regular ice can maintain temperatures near, but not below the freezing point, unless salt is used to cool the ice down further (as in a [[ice cream maker#Hand Cranked machines|traditional ice-cream maker]]). Dry ice can reliably bring the temperature well below water freezing point.\n\n===Cyclic refrigeration===\n{{Main|Heat pump and refrigeration cycle}}\nThis consists of a refrigeration cycle, where heat is removed from a low-temperature space or source and rejected to a high-temperature sink with the help of external work, and its inverse, the [[thermodynamic power cycle]]. In the power cycle, heat is supplied from a high-temperature source to the engine, part of the heat being used to produce work and the rest being rejected to a low-temperature sink. This satisfies the [[second law of thermodynamics]].\n\nA ''refrigeration cycle'' describes the changes that take place in the refrigerant as it alternately absorbs and rejects heat as it circulates through a [[refrigerator]]. It is also applied to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning [[HVACR]] work, when describing the \"process\" of refrigerant flow through an HVACR unit, whether it is a packaged or split system.\n\nHeat naturally flows from hot to cold. [[Mechanical work|Work]] is applied to cool a living space or storage volume by pumping heat from a lower temperature heat source into a higher temperature heat sink. [[Thermal insulation|Insulation]] is used to reduce the work and [[energy]] needed to achieve and maintain a lower temperature in the cooled space. The operating principle of the refrigeration cycle was described mathematically by [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] in 1824 as a [[Carnot heat engine|heat engine]].\n\nThe most common types of refrigeration systems use the reverse-Rankine [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] cycle, although [[absorption heat pump]]s are used in a minority of applications.\n\nCyclic refrigeration can be classified as:\n#Vapor cycle, and\n#Gas cycle\n\nVapor cycle refrigeration can further be classified as:\n#[[Vapor-compression refrigeration]]\n#Sorption Refrigeration\n##[[Absorption refrigerator|Vapor-absorption refrigeration]]\n##[[Adsorption refrigeration]]\n\n====Vapor-compression cycle====\n{{See also|Vapor-compression refrigeration}}\n[[File:Refrigeration.png|frame|right|Figure 1: Vapor compression refrigeration]]\n[[File:RefrigerationTS.png|frame|right|Figure 2: Temperature\u2013Entropy diagram]]\nThe vapor-compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators as well as in many large commercial and [[Industrial refrigerator|industrial refrigeration]] systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system.\n\nThe [[thermodynamics]] of the cycle can be analyzed on a diagram<ref>[http://web.me.unr.edu/me372/Spring2001/Vapor%20Compression%20Refrigeration%20Cycles.pdf The Ideal Vapor-Compression Cycle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226113352/http://web.me.unr.edu/me372/Spring2001/Vapor%20Compression%20Refrigeration%20Cycles.pdf |date=2007-02-26}}</ref> as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as [[Freon]] enters the [[gas compressor|compressor]] as a vapor. From point 1 to point 2, the vapor is compressed at constant [[entropy]] and exits the compressor as a vapor at a higher temperature, but still below the [[vapor pressure]] at that temperature. From point 2 to point 3 and on to point 4, the vapor travels through the [[condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] which cools the vapor until it starts condensing, and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. Between points 4 and 5, the liquid refrigerant goes through the [[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]] (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing [[flash evaporation]] and auto-refrigeration of, typically, less than half of the liquid.\n\nThat results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure as shown at point 5. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet at point 1 to complete the thermodynamic cycle.\n\nThe above discussion is based on the ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, and does not take into account real-world effects like frictional pressure drop in the system, slight [[thermodynamic reversibility|thermodynamic irreversibility]] during the compression of the refrigerant vapor, or [[ideal gas|non-ideal gas]] behavior, if any. Vapor compression refrigerators can be arranged in two stages in [[cascade refrigeration]] systems, with the second stage cooling the condenser of the first stage. This can be used for achieving very low temperatures. \n\nMore information about the design and performance of vapor-compression refrigeration systems is available in the classic ''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Perry, R.H. |author2=Green, D.W. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook|edition=6th |publisher=McGraw Hill, Inc.|year=1984|isbn=978-0-07-049479-4|title-link=Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook}} (see pp. 12-27 through 12-38)</ref>\n\n====Sorption cycle====\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n=====Absorption cycle=====\n{{Main|Absorption refrigerator}}\nIn the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems or [[lithium bromide|LiBr]]-water was popular and widely used. After the development of the vapor compression cycle, the vapor absorption cycle lost much of its importance because of its low [[coefficient of performance]] (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Today, the vapor absorption cycle is used mainly where fuel for heating is available but electricity is not, such as in [[recreational vehicles]] that carry [[liquefied petroleum gas|LP gas]]. It is also used in industrial environments where plentiful waste heat overcomes its inefficiency.\n\nThe absorption cycle is similar to the compression cycle, except for the method of raising the pressure of the refrigerant vapor. In the absorption system, the compressor is replaced by an absorber which dissolves the refrigerant in a suitable liquid, a liquid pump which raises the pressure and a generator which, on heat addition, drives off the refrigerant vapor from the high-pressure liquid. Some work is needed by the liquid pump but, for a given quantity of refrigerant, it is much smaller than needed by the compressor in the vapor compression cycle. In an absorption refrigerator, a suitable combination of refrigerant and absorbent is used. The most common combinations are ammonia (refrigerant) with water (absorbent), and water (refrigerant) with lithium bromide (absorbent).\n\n=====Adsorption cycle=====\n{{Main|Adsorption refrigeration}}\nIn adsorption refrigeration, the refrigerant (adsorbate) could be ammonia, water, [[methanol]], etc, while the adsorbent is a solid, such as [[silicone gel]], [[activated carbon]], or [[zeolite]], unlike in the absorption cycle where absorbent is liquid.\n\n====Gas cycle====\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nWhen the [[working fluid]] is a gas that is compressed and expanded but doesn't change phase, the refrigeration cycle is called a ''gas cycle''. [[Air]] is most often this working fluid. As there is no condensation and evaporation intended in a gas cycle, components corresponding to the condenser and evaporator in a vapor compression cycle are the hot and cold gas-to-gas [[heat exchanger]]s in gas cycles.\n\nThe gas cycle is less efficient than the vapor compression cycle because the gas cycle works on the reverse [[Brayton cycle]] instead of the reverse [[Rankine cycle]]. As such the working fluid does not receive and reject heat at constant temperature. In the gas cycle, the refrigeration effect is equal to the product of the specific heat of the gas and the rise in temperature of the gas in the low temperature side. Therefore, for the same cooling load, a gas refrigeration cycle needs a large mass flow rate and is bulky.\n\nBecause of their lower efficiency and larger bulk, ''air cycle'' coolers are not often used nowadays in terrestrial cooling devices. However, the [[air cycle machine]] is very common on [[gas turbine]]-powered jet [[aircraft]] as cooling and ventilation units, because compressed air is readily available from the engines' compressor sections. Such units also serve the purpose of pressurizing the aircraft.\n\n===Thermoelectric refrigeration===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[Thermoelectric cooling]] uses the [[Peltier effect]] to create a heat [[flux]] between the junction of two types of material. This effect is commonly used in camping and portable coolers and for cooling electronic components and small instruments. Peltier coolers are often used where a traditional vapor-compression cycle refrigerator would be impractical or take up too much space, and in cooled image sensors as an easy, compact and lightweight, if inefficient, way to achieve very low temperatures, using 2 or more stage peltier coolers arranged in a [[cascade refrigeration]] configuration, meaning that 2 or more peltier elements are stacked on top of each other, with each stage being larger than the one before it,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kryothermtec.com/four-stage-thermoelectric-coolers.html|title=4-stage thermoelectric coolers|website=kryothermtec.com}}</ref> in order to extract more heat and waste heat generated by the previous stages. Peltier cooling only has 1/4 the efficiency of the vapor-compression cycle so it doesn't extract as much heat, emits more waste heat (heat generated by the peltier element or cooling mechanism) and consumes more power for a given cooling capacity.\n\n===Magnetic refrigeration===\n{{Main|Magnetic refrigeration}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nMagnetic refrigeration, or [[adiabatic]] [[demagnetization]], is a cooling technology based on the magnetocaloric effect, an [[intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic property]] of magnetic solids. The refrigerant is often a [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]], such as [[cerium]] [[magnesium]] [[nitrate]]. The active [[magnetic field|magnetic]] [[dipole]]s in this case are those of the [[electron shell]]s of the paramagnetic atoms.\n\nA strong magnetic field is applied to the refrigerant, forcing its various magnetic dipoles to align and putting these degrees of freedom of the refrigerant into a state of lowered [[entropy]]. A heat sink then absorbs the heat released by the refrigerant due to its loss of entropy. Thermal contact with the heat sink is then broken so that the system is insulated, and the magnetic field is switched off. This increases the heat capacity of the refrigerant, thus decreasing its temperature below the temperature of the heat sink.\n\nBecause few materials exhibit the needed properties at room temperature, applications have so far been limited to [[cryogenics]] and research.\n\n===Other methods===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nOther methods of refrigeration include the [[air cycle machine]] used in aircraft; the [[vortex tube]] used for spot cooling, when compressed air is available; and [[thermoacoustic refrigeration]] using sound waves in a pressurized gas to drive heat transfer and heat exchange; [[steam jet cooling]] popular in the early 1930s for air conditioning large buildings; thermoelastic cooling using a smart metal alloy stretching and relaxing. Many [[Stirling cycle]] heat engines can be run backwards to act as a refrigerator, and therefore these engines have a niche use in [[cryogenics]]. In addition there are other types of [[cryocoolers]] such as Gifford-McMahon coolers, Joule-Thomson coolers, [[Pulse tube refrigerator|pulse-tube refrigerators]] and, for temperatures between 2 mK and 500 mK, [[dilution refrigerator]]s.\n\n===Elastocaloric refrigeration===\nAnother potential solid-state refrigeration technique and a relatively new area of study comes from a special property of [[pseudoelasticity|super elastic]] materials. These materials undergo a temperature change when experiencing an applied mechanical [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] (called the elastocaloric effect). Since super elastic materials deform reversibly at high [[strain (mechanics)|strains]], the material experiences a flattened [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] region in its [[stress-strain curve]] caused by a resulting phase transformation from an [[austenite|austenitic]] to a [[martensite|martensitic]] crystal phase.\n\nWhen a super elastic material experiences a stress in the austenitic phase, it undergoes an [[exothermic]] [[phase transition|phase transformation]] to the martensitic phase, which causes the material to heat up. Removing the stress reverses the process, restores the material to its austenitic phase, and [[endothermic process|absorbs heat]] from the surroundings cooling down the material.\n\nThe most appealing part of this research is how potentially energy efficient and environmentally friendly this cooling technology is. The different materials used, commonly [[shape-memory alloy]]s, provide a non-toxic source of emission free refrigeration. The most commonly studied materials studied are shape-memory alloys, like [[nitinol]] and Cu-Zn-Al. Nitinol is of the more promising alloys with output heat at about 66 J/cm<sup>3</sup> and a temperature change of about 16\u201320 K.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tu\u0161ek|first1=J.|last2=Engelbrecht|first2=K.|last3=Mikkelsen|first3=L.P.|last4=Pryds|first4=N.|title=Elastocaloric effect of Ni-Ti wire for application in a cooling device|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=February 2015|volume=117|issue=12|pages=124901|doi=10.1063/1.4913878|accessdate=|bibcode=2015JAP...117l4901T|url=http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/elastocaloric-effect-of-niti-wire-for-application-in-a-cooling-device(dcba0d01-f845-4210-9ea7-62e269e281bd).html}}</ref> Due to the difficulty in manufacturing some of the shape memory alloys, alternative materials like [[natural rubber]] have been studied. Even though rubber may not give off as much heat per volume (12 J/cm<sup>3</sup> ) as the shape memory alloys, it still generates a comparable temperature change of about 12 K and operates at a suitable temperature range, low stresses, and low cost.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Xie|first1=Zhongjian|last2=Sebald|first2=Gael|last3=Guyomar|first3=Daniel|title=Temperature dependence of the elastocaloric effect in natural rubber|journal=Physics Letters A|date=21 February 2017|volume=381|issue=25\u201326|pages=2112\u20132116|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2017.02.014|accessdate=|arxiv=1604.02686|bibcode=2017PhLA..381.2112X}}</ref>\n\nThe main challenge however comes from potential energy losses in the form of [[hysteresis]], often associated with this process. Since most of these losses comes from incompatibilities between the two phases, proper alloy tuning is necessary to reduce losses and increase reversibility and [[energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]]. Balancing the transformation strain of the material with the energy losses enables a large elastocaloric effect to occur and potentially a new alternative for refrigeration.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=Benfeng|last2=Liu|first2=Jian|title=Elastocaloric effect and superelastic stability in Ni\u2013Mn\u2013In\u2013Co polycrystalline Heusler alloys: hysteresis and strain-rate effects|journal=Scientific Reports|date=18 May 2017|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2084|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-02300-3|pmid=28522819|pmc=5437036|accessdate=|bibcode=2017NatSR...7.2084L}}</ref>\n\n===Fridge Gate===\nThe Fridge Gate method is a theoretical application of using a single logic gate to drive a refrigerator in the most energy efficient way possible without violating the laws of thermodynamics. It operates on the fact that there are two energy states in which a particle can exist: the ground state and the excited state. The excited state carries a little more energy than the ground state, small enough so that the transition occurs with high probability. There are three components or particle types associated with the fridge gate. The first is on the interior of the fridge, the second on the outside and the third is connected to a power supply which heats up every so often that it can reach the E state and replenish the source. In the cooling step on the inside of the fridge, the g state particle absorbs energy from ambient particles, cooling them, and itself jumping to the e state. In the second step, on the outside of the fridge where the particles are also at an e state, the particle falls to the g state, releasing energy and heating the outside particles. In the third and final step, the power supply moves a particle at the e state, and when it falls to the g state it induces an energy-neutral swap where the interior e particle is replaced by a new g particle, restarting the cycle.<ref>{{cite journal\n|title= Thermodynamics: The fridge gate\n|author= Renato Renner\n|journal= Nature\n|volume= 482\n|issue= 7384\n|date= 9 February 2012\n|pages= 164\u2013165\n|doi= 10.1038/482164a\n|pmid= 22318595\n|bibcode= 2012Natur.482..164R\n}}</ref>\n\n===Passive systems===\nMIT researchers have devised a new way of providing cooling on a hot sunny day, using inexpensive materials and requiring no fossil fuel-generated power. The passive system, which could be used to supplement other cooling systems to preserve food and medications in hot, off-grid locations, is essentially a high-tech version of a parasol.<ref>{{cite web |title=A new way to provide cooling without power |url=https://news.mit.edu/2018/device-provides-cooling-without-power-1128 |website=MIT News |accessdate=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Capacity ratings==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe measured capacity of refrigeration is always dimensioned in units of [[power (physics)|power]]. Domestic and commercial refrigerators may be rated in kJ/s, or Btu/h of cooling. For commercial and industrial refrigeration systems, the '''kilowatt''' (kW) is the basic unit of refrigeration{{and}}except in North America, where the '''[[ton of refrigeration]]''' (TR) is used. (Nominally the capacity to freeze one [[short ton]] of water per day, the TR is defined as 12,000 Btu/hr (3.517&nbsp;kW).)\n\nA refrigeration system's '''[[coefficient of performance]]''' (CoP) is very important in determining a system's overall efficiency. It is defined as refrigeration capacity in kW divided by the energy input in kW. While CoP is a very simple measure of performance, it is typically not used for industrial refrigeration in North America. Owners and manufacturers of these systems typically use '''performance factor''' (PF). A system's PF is defined as a system's energy input in horsepower divided by its refrigeration capacity in TR. Both CoP and PF can be applied to either the entire system or to system components. For example, an individual compressor can be rated by comparing the energy needed to run the compressor versus the expected refrigeration capacity based on inlet volume flow rate. It is important to note that both CoP and PF for a refrigeration system are only defined at specific operating conditions, including temperatures and thermal loads.

While India is more often known for its ([[Hindustani classical music|northern]] and [[Carnatic music|southern]]) [[Indian classical music|classical music]], [[filmi]], [[Bollywood music]], [[Indi-pop]], and [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]], the Indian rock scene has also produced numerous bands and artists.\n\n==Early history==\nIndia, in the 1950s and 1960s, had a record industry in the Gramophone Company of India (an RCA/HMV/EMI subsidiary), and [[Long playing records|LPs]], [[Extended play|EPs]], and [[45rpm]] records were freely available, including those of [[rock and roll]] acts from the US and Britain, but also of contemporary pioneering Indian rock bands. The president of the firm, [[Bhaskar Menon]] (who later became the President of [[Capitol Records]] in the United States) was the leading promoter of Western pop music in India. Later in 1970, [[Polydor]], the German Label, began an India label distributing rock music.\n\nOf these mid-1960s to early 70s [[Beat music|beat]] groups, as they was then termed, one of the most notable were the [[Mystiks]] from [[Mumbai|Bombay]], the [[Beat-X]] from [[Chennai|Madras]], and the Flintstone from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], who composed and played both early [[British Invasion]] influenced songs, and post-''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]'' [[hard rock]]. During this period from Delhi there were The Thunderbirds (featuring singer Ashwani Bali, bass guitarist Percy Singh), and WAFWOT (also with Ashwani on vocals, with organist Mark Spevak, from the U.S. & bass guitarist Percy Singh, from Delhi) These bands played regularly on the Indian university and college music circuits, and some had successful EP and LP releases. Also notable from this period (1964\u20131970) was the female [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]  singer, Usha Iyer, now [[Usha Uthup]], who had successful covers of \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]\" and [[The Kingston Trio]] song, \"Greenback Dollar\". A notable compilation LP titled \"Simla Beat '70\" was released during this period, from a contest of the same name. The winning bands recorded their versions of Western hard rock of the time. This tradition of covering Western rock would continue until the 1980s when it was more common to compose original songs.\n\nThe rock n' roll scene was also closely followed by ''[[The Statesman (India)|Junior Statesman]]'' (or ''JS''), a magazine started in 1965 contemporaneously with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in the US and [[NME]] in the UK.\n\n{{Listen\n| filename    = \n| title       = \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuchh Yahan\"\n| description = [[Asha Bhosle]]'s \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuch Yahan\" from the film ''[[Apradh]]'' (1972)\n| pos         = right\n}}\n\nLike Western rock musicians at the time, Indian musicians also began fusing rock with traditional Indian music from the mid-1960s onwards. Many of these songs were often ''[[filmi]]'' songs produced for popular [[Bollywood]] films, which often overshadowed the country's independent rock scene. Some of the more well known early rock songs (including styles such as [[funk rock]], [[pop rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[raga rock]], and [[soft rock]]) from Bollywood films include [[Mohammed Rafi]]'s \"[[Jaan Pehechan Ho]]\" in ''[[Gumnaam]]'' (1965), [[Kishore Kumar]]'s \"O Saathi Re\" in ''[[Muqaddar Ka Sikandar]]'' (1978), and [[Asha Bhosle]] songs such as \"[[Dum Maro Dum (song)|Dum Maro Dum]]\" in ''[[Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971 film)|Hare Rama Hare Krishna]]'' (1971), \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab\" in ''[[Apradh]]'' (1972), and \"Yeh Mera Dil Pyar Ka Diwana\" in ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' (1978).\n\n===Indian influence on Western music===\n{{See also|Raga rock|Psychedelic rock|The Beatles in India}}\n\nIn the 1960s, renowned [[Western world|Western]] acts such as [[The Yardbirds]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Doors]] and [[The Byrds]] were notably influenced by [[Indian classical music]] as a way of reinforcing the [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] in their music. While [[jazz]] musicians, notably [[John Coltrane]], had ventured into Indian music and spiritualism (see [[Indo jazz]], [[Sitar in jazz]], and [[Jazz in India]]), the influence of Indian classical music on 1960s rock began in earnest with [[George Harrison]]'s [[Ravi Shankar]] inspired [[raga rock]] song \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\" in 1965 and The Beatles' very public sojourn with the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] at his [[ashram]] in [[Rishikesh]] in 1968, following the release of ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' in 1967. Raga rock led to the development of [[psychedelic rock]], which in turn laid the foundations for [[heavy metal music]].\n\nThe Indian rock scene would later give rise to one of the world's most famous rock stars, [[Freddie Mercury]], born Farrokh Bulsara. One of his formative musical influences was the Bollywood singer [[Lata Mangeshkar]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Liam|title=Farrokh Bulsara|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/at_bulsara.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=28 April 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523230337/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/at_bulsara.html|archivedate=23 May 2011|year=2006}}</ref> He began his music career as a teenager in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] with the rock band, [[The Hectics]], which was founded in 1958 and often performed [[cover version]]s of Western [[rock and roll]] artists such as [[Little Richard]] and [[Cliff Richard]].<ref>{{citation|last=Hodkinson|first=Mark|year=2004|title=Queen: The Early Years|place=London|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=1-84449-012-2|pages=2 & 61}}</ref> After leaving the band in 1962, he moved to England, where he later led the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (formed in 1971), which went on to become one of the world's most famous rock bands.\n\nThe Indian rock scene also gave rise to one of the pioneers of [[disco]] music, [[Biddu]],<ref name=\"metro_biddu\">{{cite web|title=Biddu|author=James Ellis|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/412-biddu|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Listener, Volumes 100-101|work=[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|year=1978|page=216|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tRBAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=21 June 2011|quote=Tony Palmer knocked off a film account of someone called Biddu (LWT), who appears to have been mad enough to invent disco music.}}</ref> who originally began his career in an Indian rock band called The Trojans.

After the band broke up, he moved in 1967 to England, where he later found breakthrough success after producing \"[[Kung Fu Fighting]]\" for [[Carl Douglas]].\n\n==1980s and 1990s==\n\nWhile the [[orientalism|orientalist]] trend of the 60s and 70s was by the 80s and 90s largely over, India itself continued to produce bands in various styles of rock music, from soft [[rock and roll]] and [[pop rock]], to [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]]. In the early 1980s, however, rock was largely overshadowed by [[disco]], which dominated [[Indian pop]] music up until the mid-1980s.\n\nWith the arrival of [[MTV]], tastes rapidly changed, encouraging bands to harden their style and focus more on underground styles such as [[death metal]], [[alternative rock|alternative metal]], and [[progressive rock]]. The 1990s saw the rise of a much larger following of various harder styles for this reason. Bands that had formed in the 80s, such as Rock Machine (who would later be known as [[Indus Creed]]) - (including Mahesh Tinnaikar, Uday Benegal, etc.)...altered their style with the influx of newer techniques and influences from the west. Notable suburban metal-blues bands with 1960s and 1970s metal influences included IIT Powaii based Axecalibre, fronted by Oliver Pinto, Prashant Nair and covered flamboyant guitar-based blues and hardcore metal including ballads. Contemporaries of the time were Easy Meat from Pune and Bands such as Holocaust, Morgue (fronted by vocalist Mrinal Das, Drummer Neeraj Kakoty, Ambar Das and Raju Seal on Twin Attack Guitars, Manas Chowdhury on Bass), Dorian Platonic from Guwahati, Assam, Grassroots Revival, Postmark, The Cannibals, Phoenix,Phynyx and Drixian Empire/Dark Crusader from Manipur. \n\nOthers formed in the 1990s with harder styles influenced by the growing split between popular rock, such as [[Britpop]], alternative styles, such as [[punk rock|punk]], and metal styles, such as [[thrash metal|thrash]]. The Indian subgenre of fusion, which encourages a similar blend of ancient Indian musical traditions with rock music to [[raga rock]], was also carried forward, and is perhaps the most unusual Indian style of rock. Needless to say the rise of Sanskrit Rock Band (The Army of Narasimha Dev) had sprung to instant success in no time, founded by Lead vocalist Biju Gangadharan from ISKCON background, is a Sanskrit scholar and a highly talented Master in composing Sanskrit mantras into modern age rock music. Biju Gangadharan is considered as Sanskrit Rock Guru with a stunning performance in 33 countries up his shoulder. His guitarist, Chandresh Kudwa, is the most successful lead guitarist in India, and his percussionist, Nishadh Chandra, turned out to be the busiest music programmer in Bollywood. It was during this time that [[Palash Sen]]'s Euphoria surfaced in the Indian scene as a straight ahead English rock band. The band later started writing in Hindi, and gave birth to what is now known as \"Hindi Rock\". Euphoria went on to become India's most popular, successful and commercially accepted Independent act.\n\n==2000s==\n\nThe current Indian rock scene has a larger following than ever (although it is still marginalized compared to Indian film music, particularly the [[filmi]] soundtracks of [[Bollywood]]) and may soon become recognized in the international arena, as various South American and Japanese bands have become. Recent entries into the rock music scene are increasingly becoming comparable in their production quality to Western bands, and have been compared favorably to other internationally recognized acts. Now digital technology is making it easier than ever for these bands to distribute and sell their music. Some British bands of South Asian origin, such as [[Swami (band)|Swami]] have, like their [[hip-hop]] counterparts, tried to enter the Indian market in addition to maintaining the traditional fanbase of non-resident Indians in United Kingdom, [[Indo-Canadians|Canada]] and the [[Indian American|United States]]. Others, such as [[Rudra (band)|Rudra]], have emerged from Indian communities in other Asian countries. Progress is certain for the Indian rock scene with the advent of entities that support this genre. [[Rock Street Journal]] and Rolling Stone India<ref>{{cite web|title=Rolling stone|url=http://rollingstoneindia.com/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> are the two major publications that have been promoting Indian rock bands. The scene has also been transformed by the online medium, and the subsequent rise of a number of online portals promoting Indian rock, most notably the indie music website NH7,<ref>{{cite web|title=NH7 Radio|url=http://nh7.in/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> Headbangers India,<ref>{{cite web|title=HeadBangers India|url=http://www.headbangers.in/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> IndianMusicMug,<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with UFO\u2019s guitarist Vinnie Moore|url=http://indianmusicmug.com/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> Unholy Maunder, IndianMusicRevolution, Indian Metal Scene etc.<ref>{{cite web|title=IMR|url=http://www.indianmusicrevolution.com/|accessdate=6 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105043221/http://indianmusicrevolution.com/|archive-date=5 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> and Metal Spree.\n\n== Sub-genres ==\n\n=== Raga rock ===\n{{Main article|Raga rock}}\n{{See also|Psychedelic rock}}\n\nIn the West, some groups, such as [[The Beatles]], traveled to India and incorporated aspects of Indian music, especially classical instruments such as the [[sitar]], into their music, often as a way of conjuring [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] 'Eastern' feelings. The term for this was [[raga rock]], and examples of it are [[The Beatles]] \"[[Love You To]]\", \"[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]\",\"[[Across the Universe]]\",\"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\", \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\", \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\"; [[The Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Paint it, Black]]\"; [[The Kinks]]' \"Fancy\"; [[The Doors]]' \"[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]\" and [[The Byrds]]' \"[[Eight Miles High]]\". A number of prolific Indian classical musicians such as [[Ravi Shankar]] aligned themselves with this trend, collaborating with Western artists. Indian bands themselves mainly covered early rock songs by pioneers of rock and roll in the United Kingdom and [[United States|America]], and only achieved recognition in popular culture by supporting film scores and Indian pop.\n\n=== Indian fusion ===\n{{main article|Indian fusion}}\n\nAn Indian subgenre of rock exists that focuses on blending traditional Indian styles of music with rock music. The term for non-Indian bands using Indian instrumentals and vocal in rock is [[raga rock]]. However, Indian fusion also encompasses attempts by Indian pop musicians and film composers to incorporate rock music into their work, starting in the 70s with film scores like those of the [[Amitabh Bachchan]] classics. The [[Brown Indian Band]] features accomplished Indian classical musicians in concert with jazz virtuosos. More recently the multi-cultural British band [[Botown]] have taken elements of Bollywood and fused them with soul and funk to great success. The New Delhi Based Band 'Ojapali' is also doing a lots of experiments with Electronica Fusion music and Folk music of the Assam Region.\nThe Kochi-based band [[Motherjane]] typifies bands producing this genre of music. [[Motherjane]] guitarist [[Baiju Dharmajan]] is a pioneer of introducing the guitar music style known as carnatic shredding. Bangalore based carnatic rock band [[Agam (band)|Agam]] and fusion rock outfit Divine Raaga, Kaav, Veenar are other examples of mature songmakers in the country.<ref>[http://www.musicmalt.com/2011/12/eastern-fare-rocks-trinity-guild-hall.html Bangalore - Music Malt]</ref>\nKarnatriix is another band which has defined a new genre of fusion music labelled 'New-age World music'. Their ever-evolving sound today registers as ideally in sync with the 21st century's pan-cultural landscape. The name 'KARNATRIIX' which is a word play, meaning 'Aural Trickery', openly defines their music. Mellifluous melodies and sophisticated phrases deep-rooted in Blues music with an Indian Classical touch, combined with raw percussion and electronically produced subtle beats, voices and effects, form the core essence of the Karnatriix's musical nature. Indian Guitarist [[Kapil Srivastava]] composed Rock and Raga Fusion music in his Indian Guitaroo Volume 1.<ref>{{cite news|title=ZeeNews|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/musicindia/kapil-srivastava-cuts-his-new-album-indian-guitaroo_91243.html|accessdate=5 February 2015|newspaper=ZeeNews}}</ref>. [[The_Iyer_Project_(band)|The Iyer Project]] is another Delhi based band that blends Carnatic style vocals and guitar playing influenced by Baiju Dharmajan and [[R. Prasanna]] with rock and roll and progressive rock.\n\n=== Indian funk ===\nIndian [[funk]] is a loose term describing the style of rock and roll which is sometimes blurred into the realms of pop and other genres. Whereas Indian fusion may only incorporate Indian styles into rock, or rock into Indian forms of music, Indian funk can be broadly defined as what rap-metal is to heavy metal - an infusion of elements from rap, reggae, pop and dance genres that some might consider to not be 'true' rock. Groups originating in South Asian communities in Western countries like Britain are noted for this style, with bands such as [[Swami (band)|Swami]] and [[Asian Dub Foundation]] using elements of [[UK garage]], [[Bhangra (music)|UK bhangra]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], such as synthesizers, rap vocals and [[phonograph|turntables]]. Also based in the UK, [[Botown]] take an approach inspired by [[Funkadelic]] with a large lineup of live musicians to blend Bollywood music with [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]]. Few rock bands such as Silent Echo (Delhi) and Psycho Frequency (Delhi) use a wide range of samples and mechanically evolved sounds.

The band is widely known for being the pioneers of Metal Music in Central India.]]\n\n===Vedic metal===\nThe heavy metal band M.A.I.D.S (Metal Aliens in Devil's Soul) laid the foundation of heavy metal and rock in South India, Madras in the early 90s. Singaporean band [[Rudra (band)|Rudra]] initially got their worldwide push from major heavy metal label Sonic Wave International. With their style of 'Vedic metal' based around Hindu themes, the band have gained some fame in South East Asia, fusing heavy metal with Indian traditional music, in the vein of Brazil's [[Sepultura]], although they do not use avant-garde instruments such as them. Many international critics from the United States, Germany, and other countries have given the band's albums rave reviews.\n\nSince the genre was pioneered by Rudra in the late 1990s, it has grown in popularity. Bands like Wingz of Vayraag (India), [[Aryadeva]] (Ukraine), Symmetry (Indonesia), Warriors of Peace (India), Asura (India), Advaita (India), The Aryan March (India), [[Bhairav (band)|Bhairav]] (India), Madhavas Rock Band (India), Narasimha (Singapore), Kaliyuga (Singapore), Azrael (Australia), Dying Out Flame (Nepal), Blue River (Sri Lanka), Punarjanma (India), and Kartikeya (Russia) have done pioneering work in the subgenre. Often, along with Vedic lyrics, the music has shades of [[Indian classical music]]. With the introduction of new subgenre of heavy metal, the Vedic-core bands like, Antim-Yuddha, [[Roktobeej]] are contributing to the rising Indian underground rock culture. The definitive album of this genre [[Rudra (band)|Rudra]]\u2019s [[The Aryan Crusade]] (2001). In addition, India has produced many heavy metal bands that combine ethnic-[[folk music]] with various forms of heavy metal to create other [[folk metal]] bands. Indian rock has been influenced by some notable cultural trends, and has in turn produced influences of its own. Indian musicians have also collaborated with other musicians from across the globe.\n\n====Heavy metal====\n\nMillennium was formed in 1988 as one of the first Indian metal bands, and it laid the foundation for the Indian heavy metal scene. [[Demonic Resurrection]] laid the foundation for Indian extreme metal early in 2000 when extreme metal in India was a scarce minority, since then it has garnered popularity especially in the underground scene and spawned many bands such as Corroded Dreams, Escher's Knot, Crypted, Bestial Murder, and some bands have adapted to black metal driven sound with a rawer sound and [[Satanism|satanic]] lyrics. Bands such as Dark Desolation from Bengaluru and [[Fortified Destruction]] from Chennai have gone down that path. Many prolific extreme metal bands have spawned from the Chennai local scenes like Siva from [[Crypted]], Abhijit Rao from Escher's Knot, Vyas \"Hex\" Manalan from Fortified Destruction who are all frontmen of their respective bands and all known for their extreme vocal capabilities and the addition of guitar in the case of Hex. With many extreme metal bands from other countries, such as Behemoth, Gojira, and Cradle of Filth are setting foot on the India. Some of the most popular heavy metal bands in India are Undying INC, Zygnema, Bhayanak Maut, Albatros, Noiseware, Abraxas, Devoid, Sceptre, Kryptos, The Down Troddence, Crypted, Halakuah, Inner Sanctum, Scribe, and Cosmic Infusion.

Over the years, this city has produced some of the finest rock and metal music bands but they have always gone unnoticed because of being from a small town. In the 1990s, bands like Genesis, Kaalmantra and Sparsh<ref name=\"The Times of India for 'Sparsh'\">{{cite web |title=Ranchi rock band to perform today|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Ranchi-rock-band-to-perform-today/articleshow/2639039.cms|publisher=The Times of India}}</ref> have been considered as the pioneers to rock and metal music in Jharkhand. The city has had various music festivals being organized since the 2000s and a few of them are still organized today with the biggest one being [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref name=\"The Telegraph for 'Thunderstrock Festival'\">{{cite web |title=Rock concert next month|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/rock-concert-next-month/cid/1310535|publisher=The Telegraph}}</ref> and other notable festivals are like Rock Jatra and Rhapsody.

The bands of Ranchi have been touring and performing across the country with currently [[Highway 69 (band)]] being the most notable one as it has performed extensively all over the country and has evolved with a huge fan base, followed by other bands like Reciprocal<ref name=\"The Avenue Mail\">{{cite web |title=Local rock bands ready to rock for voters\u2019 awareness in Ranchi|url=https://www.avenuemail.in/jamshedpur/local-rock-bands-ready-to-rock-for-voters-awareness-in-ranchi/132565/|publisher=The Avenue Mail}}</ref>, Existence, Vikrit, Iris 13 etc. Other active and notable bands from the 2010s were Genesis, Kaalmantra, Sparsh, 4 Degrees of Freedom, Conflicting Resonance etc.\n\n== Independent record labels ==\nMainstream record labels in India often ignore rock, with a few exceptions. Album sales range between a few hundred copies to a few thousand. They are rarely, if at all, affiliated to the Indian music industry, and sales are not usually monitored. Songs of Bollywood usually gain more popularity as compared to the songs of bands. This is a huge set back. Bands also fail to sell their songs throughout the country even after making it available to major music stores, this is only due to lack of interest of people in rock bands. There are only a few bands that have become successful in selling their songs throughout the country. People who enjoy rock get the songs of their favorite bands, just by a click from any music website (sometimes their songs are uploaded by website administrators just after the day of release, this is illegal as per copyright law, but even then no action is taken). Hence, overall sales become less than expected. Bands in India mostly perform live shows with low priced tickets (as low as Rs. 100 or even less). Probably, the growing and the upcoming generation will have interest in Indian Rock and Metal. But care has to be taken to retain the copyright of the music.\n\nThe future looks encouraging thanks to entities such as Green Ozone, [[DogmaTone]] Records, [[Cochym]] and [[Eastern Fare Music Foundation]], [[Infestdead Records]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tntmagazine.in/tnt-y-news/northeast-gets-its-first-metal-label-signs-savage-uk/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827041640/http://tntmagazine.in/tnt-y-news/northeast-gets-its-first-metal-label-signs-savage-uk/ |archive-date=27 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2012/08/23/india-gets-a-new-metal-label-signs-nwobhm-legend-savage-uk/</ref> that are dedicated to promoting and supporting Indian rock.\n\n==Documentary on Indian rock==\n\nIn 2008, music journalist Abhimanyu Kukreja directed Rockumentary - Becoming of Indian rock that was produced by NewsX and had a national TV release.

While India is more often known for its ([[Hindustani classical music|northern]] and [[Carnatic music|southern]]) [[Indian classical music|classical music]], [[filmi]], [[Bollywood music]], [[Indi-pop]], and [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]], the Indian rock scene has also produced numerous bands and artists.\n\n==Early history==\nIndia, in the 1950s and 1960s, had a record industry in the Gramophone Company of India (an RCA/HMV/EMI subsidiary), and [[Long playing records|LPs]], [[Extended play|EPs]], and [[45rpm]] records were freely available, including those of [[rock and roll]] acts from the US and Britain, but also of contemporary pioneering Indian rock bands. The president of the firm, [[Bhaskar Menon]] (who later became the President of [[Capitol Records]] in the United States) was the leading promoter of Western pop music in India. Later in 1970, [[Polydor]], the German Label, began an India label distributing rock music.\n\nOf these mid-1960s to early 70s [[Beat music|beat]] groups, as they was then termed, one of the most notable were the [[Mystiks]] from [[Mumbai|Bombay]], the [[Beat-X]] from [[Chennai|Madras]], and the Flintstone from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], who composed and played both early [[British Invasion]] influenced songs, and post-''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper]]'' [[hard rock]]. During this period from Delhi there were The Thunderbirds (featuring singer Ashwani Bali), and WAFWOT (also with Ashwani on vocals, with organist Mark Spevak, from the U.S.) These bands played regularly on the Indian university and college music circuits, and some had successful EP and LP releases. Also notable from this period (1964\u20131970) was the female [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]  singer, Usha Iyer, now [[Usha Uthup]], who had successful covers of \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]\" and [[The Kingston Trio]] song, \"Greenback Dollar\". A notable compilation LP titled \"Simla Beat '70\" was released during this period, from a contest of the same name. The winning bands recorded their versions of Western hard rock of the time. This tradition of covering Western rock would continue until the 1980s when it was more common to compose original songs.\n\nThe rock n' roll scene was also closely followed by ''[[The Statesman (India)|Junior Statesman]]'' (or ''JS''), a magazine started in 1965 contemporaneously with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in the US and [[NME]] in the UK.\n\n{{Listen\n| filename    = \n| title       = \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuchh Yahan\"\n| description = [[Asha Bhosle]]'s \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab Kuch Yahan\" from the film ''[[Apradh]]'' (1972)\n| pos         = right\n}}\n\nLike Western rock musicians at the time, Indian musicians also began fusing rock with traditional Indian music from the mid-1960s onwards. Many of these songs were often ''[[filmi]]'' songs produced for popular [[Bollywood]] films, which often overshadowed the country's independent rock scene. Some of the more well known early rock songs (including styles such as [[funk rock]], [[pop rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[raga rock]], and [[soft rock]]) from Bollywood films include [[Mohammed Rafi]]'s \"[[Jaan Pehechan Ho]]\" in ''[[Gumnaam]]'' (1965), [[Kishore Kumar]]'s \"O Saathi Re\" in ''[[Muqaddar Ka Sikandar]]'' (1978), and [[Asha Bhosle]] songs such as \"[[Dum Maro Dum (song)|Dum Maro Dum]]\" in ''[[Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971 film)|Hare Rama Hare Krishna]]'' (1971), \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab\" in ''[[Apradh]]'' (1972), and \"Yeh Mera Dil Pyar Ka Diwana\" in ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' (1978).\n\n===Indian influence on Western music===\n{{See also|Raga rock|Psychedelic rock|The Beatles in India}}\n\nIn the 1960s, renowned [[Western world|Western]] acts such as [[The Yardbirds]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Doors]] and [[The Byrds]] were notably influenced by [[Indian classical music]] as a way of reinforcing the [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] in their music. While [[jazz]] musicians, notably [[John Coltrane]], had ventured into Indian music and spiritualism (see [[Indo jazz]], [[Sitar in jazz]], and [[Jazz in India]]), the influence of Indian classical music on 1960s rock began in earnest with [[George Harrison]]'s [[Ravi Shankar]] inspired [[raga rock]] song \"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\" in 1965 and The Beatles' very public sojourn with the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] at his [[ashram]] in [[Rishikesh]] in 1968, following the release of ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' in 1967. Raga rock led to the development of [[psychedelic rock]], which in turn laid the foundations for [[heavy metal music]].\n\nThe Indian rock scene would later give rise to one of the world's most famous rock stars, [[Freddie Mercury]], born Farrokh Bulsara. One of his formative musical influences was the Bollywood singer [[Lata Mangeshkar]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Liam|title=Farrokh Bulsara|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/at_bulsara.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=28 April 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523230337/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/at_bulsara.html|archivedate=23 May 2011|year=2006}}</ref> He began his music career as a teenager in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] with the rock band, [[The Hectics]], which was founded in 1958 and often performed [[cover version]]s of Western [[rock and roll]] artists such as [[Little Richard]] and [[Cliff Richard]].<ref>{{citation|last=Hodkinson|first=Mark|year=2004|title=Queen: The Early Years|place=London|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=1-84449-012-2|pages=2 & 61}}</ref> After leaving the band in 1962, he moved to England, where he later led the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] (formed in 1971), which went on to become one of the world's most famous rock bands.\n\nThe Indian rock scene also gave rise to one of the pioneers of [[disco]] music, [[Biddu]],<ref name=\"metro_biddu\">{{cite web|title=Biddu|author=James Ellis|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/412-biddu|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Listener, Volumes 100-101|work=[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|year=1978|page=216|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tRBAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=21 June 2011|quote=Tony Palmer knocked off a film account of someone called Biddu (LWT), who appears to have been mad enough to invent disco music.}}</ref> who originally began his career in an Indian rock band called The Trojans.

After the band broke up, he moved in 1967 to England, where he later found breakthrough success after producing \"[[Kung Fu Fighting]]\" for [[Carl Douglas]].\n\n==1980s and 1990s==\n\nWhile the [[orientalism|orientalist]] trend of the 60s and 70s was by the 80s and 90s largely over, India itself continued to produce bands in various styles of rock music, from soft [[rock and roll]] and [[pop rock]], to [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]]. In the early 1980s, however, rock was largely overshadowed by [[disco]], which dominated [[Indian pop]] music up until the mid-1980s.\n\nWith the arrival of [[MTV]], tastes rapidly changed, encouraging bands to harden their style and focus more on underground styles such as [[death metal]], [[alternative rock|alternative metal]], and [[progressive rock]]. The 1990s saw the rise of a much larger following of various harder styles for this reason. Bands that had formed in the 80s, such as Rock Machine (who would later be known as [[Indus Creed]]) - (including Mahesh Tinnaikar, Uday Benegal, etc.)...altered their style with the influx of newer techniques and influences from the west. Notable suburban metal-blues bands with 1960s and 1970s metal influences included IIT Powaii based Axecalibre, fronted by Oliver Pinto, Prashant Nair and covered flamboyant guitar-based blues and hardcore metal including ballads. Contemporaries of the time were Easy Meat from Pune and Bands such as Holocaust, Morgue (fronted by vocalist Mrinal Das, Drummer Neeraj Kakoty, Ambar Das and Raju Seal on Twin Attack Guitars, Manas Chowdhury on Bass), Dorian Platonic from Guwahati, Assam, Grassroots Revival, Postmark, The Cannibals, Phoenix,Phynyx and Drixian Empire/Dark Crusader from Manipur. \n\nOthers formed in the 1990s with harder styles influenced by the growing split between popular rock, such as [[Britpop]], alternative styles, such as [[punk rock|punk]], and metal styles, such as [[thrash metal|thrash]]. The Indian subgenre of fusion, which encourages a similar blend of ancient Indian musical traditions with rock music to [[raga rock]], was also carried forward, and is perhaps the most unusual Indian style of rock. Needless to say the rise of Sanskrit Rock Band (The Army of Narasimha Dev) had sprung to instant success in no time, founded by Lead vocalist Biju Gangadharan from ISKCON background, is a Sanskrit scholar and a highly talented Master in composing Sanskrit mantras into modern age rock music. Biju Gangadharan is considered as Sanskrit Rock Guru with a stunning performance in 33 countries up his shoulder. His guitarist, Chandresh Kudwa, is the most successful lead guitarist in India, and his percussionist, Nishadh Chandra, turned out to be the busiest music programmer in Bollywood. It was during this time that [[Palash Sen]]'s Euphoria surfaced in the Indian scene as a straight ahead English rock band. The band later started writing in Hindi, and gave birth to what is now known as \"Hindi Rock\". Euphoria went on to become India's most popular, successful and commercially accepted Independent act.\n\n==2000s==\n\nThe current Indian rock scene has a larger following than ever (although it is still marginalized compared to Indian film music, particularly the [[filmi]] soundtracks of [[Bollywood]]) and may soon become recognized in the international arena, as various South American and Japanese bands have become. Recent entries into the rock music scene are increasingly becoming comparable in their production quality to Western bands, and have been compared favorably to other internationally recognized acts. Now digital technology is making it easier than ever for these bands to distribute and sell their music. Some British bands of South Asian origin, such as [[Swami (band)|Swami]] have, like their [[hip-hop]] counterparts, tried to enter the Indian market in addition to maintaining the traditional fanbase of non-resident Indians in United Kingdom, [[Indo-Canadians|Canada]] and the [[Indian American|United States]]. Others, such as [[Rudra (band)|Rudra]], have emerged from Indian communities in other Asian countries. Progress is certain for the Indian rock scene with the advent of entities that support this genre. [[Rock Street Journal]] and Rolling Stone India<ref>{{cite web|title=Rolling stone|url=http://rollingstoneindia.com/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> are the two major publications that have been promoting Indian rock bands. The scene has also been transformed by the online medium, and the subsequent rise of a number of online portals promoting Indian rock, most notably the indie music website NH7,<ref>{{cite web|title=NH7 Radio|url=http://nh7.in/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> Headbangers India,<ref>{{cite web|title=HeadBangers India|url=http://www.headbangers.in/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> IndianMusicMug,<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with UFO\u2019s guitarist Vinnie Moore|url=http://indianmusicmug.com/|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> Unholy Maunder, IndianMusicRevolution, Indian Metal Scene etc.<ref>{{cite web|title=IMR|url=http://www.indianmusicrevolution.com/|accessdate=6 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105043221/http://indianmusicrevolution.com/|archive-date=5 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> and Metal Spree.\n\n== Sub-genres ==\n\n=== Raga rock ===\n{{Main article|Raga rock}}\n{{See also|Psychedelic rock}}\n\nIn the West, some groups, such as [[The Beatles]], traveled to India and incorporated aspects of Indian music, especially classical instruments such as the [[sitar]], into their music, often as a way of conjuring [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] 'Eastern' feelings. The term for this was [[raga rock]], and examples of it are [[The Beatles]] \"[[Love You To]]\", \"[[The Inner Light (song)|The Inner Light]]\",\"[[Across the Universe]]\",\"[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]\", \"[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]\", \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" and \"[[Within You Without You]]\"; [[The Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Paint it, Black]]\"; [[The Kinks]]' \"Fancy\"; [[The Doors]]' \"[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]\" and [[The Byrds]]' \"[[Eight Miles High]]\". A number of prolific Indian classical musicians such as [[Ravi Shankar]] aligned themselves with this trend, collaborating with Western artists. Indian bands themselves mainly covered early rock songs by pioneers of rock and roll in the United Kingdom and [[United States|America]], and only achieved recognition in popular culture by supporting film scores and Indian pop.\n\n=== Indian fusion ===\n{{main article|Indian fusion}}\n\nAn Indian subgenre of rock exists that focuses on blending traditional Indian styles of music with rock music. The term for non-Indian bands using Indian instrumentals and vocal in rock is [[raga rock]]. However, Indian fusion also encompasses attempts by Indian pop musicians and film composers to incorporate rock music into their work, starting in the 70s with film scores like those of the [[Amitabh Bachchan]] classics. The [[Brown Indian Band]] features accomplished Indian classical musicians in concert with jazz virtuosos. More recently the multi-cultural British band [[Botown]] have taken elements of Bollywood and fused them with soul and funk to great success. The New Delhi Based Band 'Ojapali' is also doing a lots of experiments with Electronica Fusion music and Folk music of the Assam Region.\nThe Kochi-based band [[Motherjane]] typifies bands producing this genre of music. [[Motherjane]] guitarist [[Baiju Dharmajan]] is a pioneer of introducing the guitar music style known as carnatic shredding. Bangalore based carnatic rock band [[Agam (band)|Agam]] and fusion rock outfit Divine Raaga, Kaav, Veenar are other examples of mature songmakers in the country.<ref>[http://www.musicmalt.com/2011/12/eastern-fare-rocks-trinity-guild-hall.html Bangalore - Music Malt]</ref>\nKarnatriix is another band which has defined a new genre of fusion music labelled 'New-age World music'. Their ever-evolving sound today registers as ideally in sync with the 21st century's pan-cultural landscape. The name 'KARNATRIIX' which is a word play, meaning 'Aural Trickery', openly defines their music. Mellifluous melodies and sophisticated phrases deep-rooted in Blues music with an Indian Classical touch, combined with raw percussion and electronically produced subtle beats, voices and effects, form the core essence of the Karnatriix's musical nature. Indian Guitarist [[Kapil Srivastava]] composed Rock and Raga Fusion music in his Indian Guitaroo Volume 1.<ref>{{cite news|title=ZeeNews|url=http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/musicindia/kapil-srivastava-cuts-his-new-album-indian-guitaroo_91243.html|accessdate=5 February 2015|newspaper=ZeeNews}}</ref>. [[The_Iyer_Project_(band)|The Iyer Project]] is another Delhi based band that blends Carnatic style vocals and guitar playing influenced by Baiju Dharmajan and [[R. Prasanna]] with rock and roll and progressive rock.\n\n=== Indian funk ===\nIndian [[funk]] is a loose term describing the style of rock and roll which is sometimes blurred into the realms of pop and other genres. Whereas Indian fusion may only incorporate Indian styles into rock, or rock into Indian forms of music, Indian funk can be broadly defined as what rap-metal is to heavy metal - an infusion of elements from rap, reggae, pop and dance genres that some might consider to not be 'true' rock. Groups originating in South Asian communities in Western countries like Britain are noted for this style, with bands such as [[Swami (band)|Swami]] and [[Asian Dub Foundation]] using elements of [[UK garage]], [[Bhangra (music)|UK bhangra]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], such as synthesizers, rap vocals and [[phonograph|turntables]]. Also based in the UK, [[Botown]] take an approach inspired by [[Funkadelic]] with a large lineup of live musicians to blend Bollywood music with [[Soul music|soul]] and [[funk]]. Few rock bands such as Silent Echo (Delhi) and Psycho Frequency (Delhi) use a wide range of samples and mechanically evolved sounds.

The band is widely known for being the pioneers of Metal Music in Central India.]]\n\n===Vedic metal===\nThe heavy metal band M.A.I.D.S (Metal Aliens in Devil's Soul) laid the foundation of heavy metal and rock in South India, Madras in the early 90s. Singaporean band [[Rudra (band)|Rudra]] initially got their worldwide push from major heavy metal label Sonic Wave International. With their style of 'Vedic metal' based around Hindu themes, the band have gained some fame in South East Asia, fusing heavy metal with Indian traditional music, in the vein of Brazil's [[Sepultura]], although they do not use avant-garde instruments such as them. Many international critics from the United States, Germany, and other countries have given the band's albums rave reviews.\n\nSince the genre was pioneered by Rudra in the late 1990s, it has grown in popularity. Bands like Wingz of Vayraag (India), [[Aryadeva]] (Ukraine), Symmetry (Indonesia), Warriors of Peace (India), Asura (India), Advaita (India), The Aryan March (India), [[Bhairav (band)|Bhairav]] (India), Madhavas Rock Band (India), Narasimha (Singapore), Kaliyuga (Singapore), Azrael (Australia), Dying Out Flame (Nepal), Blue River (Sri Lanka), Punarjanma (India), and Kartikeya (Russia) have done pioneering work in the subgenre. Often, along with Vedic lyrics, the music has shades of [[Indian classical music]]. With the introduction of new subgenre of heavy metal, the Vedic-core bands like, Antim-Yuddha, [[Roktobeej]] are contributing to the rising Indian underground rock culture. The definitive album of this genre [[Rudra (band)|Rudra]]\u2019s [[The Aryan Crusade]] (2001). In addition, India has produced many heavy metal bands that combine ethnic-[[folk music]] with various forms of heavy metal to create other [[folk metal]] bands. Indian rock has been influenced by some notable cultural trends, and has in turn produced influences of its own. Indian musicians have also collaborated with other musicians from across the globe.\n\n====Heavy metal====\n\nMillennium was formed in 1988 as one of the first Indian metal bands, and it laid the foundation for the Indian heavy metal scene. [[Demonic Resurrection]] laid the foundation for Indian extreme metal early in 2000 when extreme metal in India was a scarce minority, since then it has garnered popularity especially in the underground scene and spawned many bands such as Corroded Dreams, Escher's Knot, Crypted, Bestial Murder, and some bands have adapted to black metal driven sound with a rawer sound and [[Satanism|satanic]] lyrics. Bands such as Dark Desolation from Bengaluru and [[Fortified Destruction]] from Chennai have gone down that path. Many prolific extreme metal bands have spawned from the Chennai local scenes like Siva from [[Crypted]], Abhijit Rao from Escher's Knot, Vyas \"Hex\" Manalan from Fortified Destruction who are all frontmen of their respective bands and all known for their extreme vocal capabilities and the addition of guitar in the case of Hex. With many extreme metal bands from other countries, such as Behemoth, Gojira, and Cradle of Filth are setting foot on the India. Some of the most popular heavy metal bands in India are Undying INC, Zygnema, Bhayanak Maut, Albatros, Noiseware, Abraxas, Devoid, Sceptre, Kryptos, The Down Troddence, Crypted, Halakuah, Inner Sanctum, Scribe, and Cosmic Infusion.

Over the years, this city has produced some of the finest rock and metal music bands but they have always gone unnoticed because of being from a small town. In the 1990s, bands like Genesis, Kaalmantra and Sparsh<ref name=\"The Times of India for 'Sparsh'\">{{cite web |title=Ranchi rock band to perform today|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Ranchi-rock-band-to-perform-today/articleshow/2639039.cms|publisher=The Times of India}}</ref> have been considered as the pioneers to rock and metal music in Jharkhand. The city has had various music festivals being organized since the 2000s and a few of them are still organized today with the biggest one being [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref name=\"The Telegraph for 'Thunderstrock Festival'\">{{cite web |title=Rock concert next month|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/rock-concert-next-month/cid/1310535|publisher=The Telegraph}}</ref> and other notable festivals are like Rock Jatra and Rhapsody.

The bands of Ranchi have been touring and performing across the country with currently [[Highway 69 (band)]] being the most notable one as it has performed extensively all over the country and has evolved with a huge fan base, followed by other bands like Reciprocal<ref name=\"The Avenue Mail\">{{cite web |title=Local rock bands ready to rock for voters\u2019 awareness in Ranchi|url=https://www.avenuemail.in/jamshedpur/local-rock-bands-ready-to-rock-for-voters-awareness-in-ranchi/132565/|publisher=The Avenue Mail}}</ref>, Existence, Vikrit, Iris 13 etc. Other active and notable bands from the 2010s were Genesis, Kaalmantra, Sparsh, 4 Degrees of Freedom, Conflicting Resonance etc.\n\n== Independent record labels ==\nMainstream record labels in India often ignore rock, with a few exceptions. Album sales range between a few hundred copies to a few thousand. They are rarely, if at all, affiliated to the Indian music industry, and sales are not usually monitored. Songs of Bollywood usually gain more popularity as compared to the songs of bands. This is a huge set back. Bands also fail to sell their songs throughout the country even after making it available to major music stores, this is only due to lack of interest of people in rock bands. There are only a few bands that have become successful in selling their songs throughout the country. People who enjoy rock get the songs of their favorite bands, just by a click from any music website (sometimes their songs are uploaded by website administrators just after the day of release, this is illegal as per copyright law, but even then no action is taken). Hence, overall sales become less than expected. Bands in India mostly perform live shows with low priced tickets (as low as Rs. 100 or even less). Probably, the growing and the upcoming generation will have interest in Indian Rock and Metal. But care has to be taken to retain the copyright of the music.\n\nThe future looks encouraging thanks to entities such as Green Ozone, [[DogmaTone]] Records, [[Cochym]] and [[Eastern Fare Music Foundation]], [[Infestdead Records]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tntmagazine.in/tnt-y-news/northeast-gets-its-first-metal-label-signs-savage-uk/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827041640/http://tntmagazine.in/tnt-y-news/northeast-gets-its-first-metal-label-signs-savage-uk/ |archive-date=27 August 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.metal-rules.com/metalnews/2012/08/23/india-gets-a-new-metal-label-signs-nwobhm-legend-savage-uk/</ref> that are dedicated to promoting and supporting Indian rock.\n\n==Documentary on Indian rock==\n\nIn 2008, music journalist Abhimanyu Kukreja directed Rockumentary - Becoming of Indian rock that was produced by NewsX and had a national TV release.
