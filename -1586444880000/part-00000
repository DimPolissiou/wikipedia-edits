There is also an overhead [[gondola lift]] called the Skyfari, providing an aerial view of the zoo. The Skyfari was built in 1969 by the [[Von Roll]] tramway company of [[Bern]], Switzerland. The San Diego Zoo Skyfari is a Von Roll type 101.\n\nExhibits at the zoo are often designed around a particular [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. The same exhibit may feature many different [[Animal|animals]] that can be found side-by-side in the wild, along with native plant life. Exhibits range from an African [[rain forest]] (featuring [[gorilla]]s) to the Arctic [[taiga]] and [[tundra]] in the summertime (featuring [[polar bear]]s).  Some of the largest free-flight [[aviary|aviaries]] in existence are here, including the Owens Aviary and the Scripps Aviary. Many exhibits are \"natural\", with invisible wires and darkened blinds (to view birds), and accessible pools and open-air moats (for large mammals).\n\nThe San Diego Zoo also operates the [[San Diego Zoo Safari Park]], which displays animals in a more expansive, open setting than at the zoo. Animals are regularly exchanged between the two locations, as well as between San Diego Zoo and other zoos around the world, usually in accordance with [[Species Survival Plan]] recommendations.\n\nThe temperate, sunny maritime climate of California is well suited to many plants and animals. Besides an extensive collection of birds, reptiles, and mammals, it also maintains its grounds as an [[arboretum]], with a rare plant collection. The botanical collection includes more than 700,000 exotic plants.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the San Diego Zoo,|url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/disclaimers/aboutus.html|website=sandiegozoo.org|accessdate=January 21, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206132749/http://www.sandiegozoo.org/disclaimers/aboutus.html|archivedate=December 6, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As part of its gardening effort, some rare animal foods are grown at the zoo.

Elephant Odyssey also features a glimpse of the past, with the Fossil Portal and life-size statues of ancient creatures of Southern California next to exhibits of their modern-day counterparts.  The ancient life represented include the [[Columbian mammoth]], the [[saber-tooth cat]], the [[American lion]], the [[Buteogallus daggetti|Daggett's eagle]], and the [[Megalonyx|Jefferson's ground sloth]].  Elephant Odyssey's other animal exhibits include [[Lion|African lion]]s, [[jaguar]]s, [[Baird's tapir]]s, [[guanaco]]s, [[capybara]]s, [[spur-winged geese]], [[two-toed sloth]]s, [[Kirk's dik-dik]]s, [[secretary bird]]s, [[dung beetle]]s, [[water beetle]]s, desert [[tarantula]]s, [[toad]]s, [[newt]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[frog]]s, [[dromedary camel]]s, [[pronghorn]]s, [[Przewalski's wild horse]]s, [[burro]]s, [[llama]]s, [[rattlesnake]]s, [[western pond turtle]]s, and the [[California condor]].\n\nThe Fossil Portal is an artificial [[tar pit]] that periodically drains to reveal man-made [[Pleistocene]]-era bones. The path turns a corner and opens up at the [[Mammoth]] Passage Plaza, with exhibits for jaguars and African lions to the left, an exhibit that has housed two-toed sloths to the right, and the tip of the elephant exhibit, with a large wading pool, straight ahead. The path continues to the left along the pool, passing by the jaguar exhibit on the left. The northern end of the elephant pool drains into the Mixed Species Exhibit, which houses [[tapir]]s, capybaras, guanacos, & a [[spur-winged goose|goose]]. The path meets up with the elephant exhibit again before it reaches the Elephant Care Center, where visitors can watch keepers care for the animals. Next is an exhibit for secretary birds with grasses, a tree and a statue of the extinct Daggett's eagle nearby. Afterwards, the path goes down a [[crevasse]] with a wall embedded with [[vivarium|vivaria]] for dung beetles and [[diving beetle]]s, among other aquatic insects. The path tunnels below the elephant exhibit to reach the other side, where it continues between the elephant exhibit and a creek for native reptiles and amphibians. Just past the source of the [[stream]] is a restaurant and gift shop, and after that are exhibits for [[pronghorn]]s, [[horse]]s, and [[camel]]s. Next the path splits between a [[playground]], a rattlesnake [[terrarium]], and a California condor aviary with artificial rock spires and a stream.

The exhibit was designed to mimic the giant [[granite]] boulders that are found on [[Boulders Beach]] in South Africa, a place where these birds live. The 70-foot-long and 10-foot-wide habitat also includes a 200,000-gallon pool for the penguins that stretches 170 feet, with depths up to 13 feet. Along with the large pool, the exhibit features a cobblestone beach and a nesting area. A group of 20 penguins moved in on June 22, 2017 to get ready for when the exhibit opened on July 1, 2017.\n\nThe penguins also share their exhibit with [[leopard shark]]s. Twelve leopard sharks arrived at the San Diego Zoo on June 23, 2017 from [[SeaWorld San Diego]]. The sharks were introduced to their exhibit and their penguin neighbors on Wednesday, June 28, 2017.

The leopard exhibit does not feature the [[African leopard|African subspecies]] of leopard, however. [[Amur leopard]]s, from as far as [[Russia]] to Northern [[China]], are exhibited instead. This is because the Amur leopard is [[critically endangered]]- there are around 60 individuals left in the wild. The San Diego Zoo participates in the Amur leopard [[Species Survival Plan|Species Survival Plan,]] a breeding program that focuses on preserving the genetics of this endangered cat. The Acacia Woodland exhibit will allow the Zoo to have more breeding spaces for the cats. The Zoo has a spotted and [[Black panther|black]] Leopard, as well as two new cubs.\n\nAlong with the leopard exhibit, the Acacia Woodland exhibit in Africa Rocks features a [[vervet monkey]] troop. The vervet monkeys are very agile and one of the only primate species that lives in a woodland habitat. The aviary in this exhibit features two species of [[bee eaters]], the [[White-fronted bee-eater|white-fronted]] and [[White-throated bee-eater|white-throated]], as well as [[black-headed weaver]]s and several other bird species. The exhibit also features [[African Silverbill]]s, [[African pygmy goose|African Pygmy Geese]], [[African Jacana]]s, [[Violet-backed starling|Amethyst starling]]s, [[Beautiful Sunbird]]s, [[Blue-naped mousebird]]s, [[Collared Pratincole]]s, [[Common Waxbill]]s, [[Emerald-spotted wood dove]]s, [[Fischer's Lovebird]]s, [[Golden Breasted Starling]]s, [[Greater Painted Snipe]]s, [[Long-tailed paradise whydah]]s, [[Magpie Mannikin]]s, [[Melba Finch]]es, [[Namaqua Dove]]s, [[Pin-tailed whydah]]s, [[Purple Grenadier]]s, [[Red-billed firefinch]]es, [[Red-cheeked cordon-bleu]]s, [[Snowy-crowned robin-chat]]s, [[Stone Partridge]]s, [[Village Indigobird]]s, [[White-bellied go-away-bird]]s, [[White-headed buffalo weaver]]s, [[Yellow-crowned bishop]]s, [[Yellow-necked spurfowl|Yellow Necked Francolin]]s, [[Yellow-mantled widowbird]]s, and [[Zebra Waxbill]]s. There are also three species of lizards in the aviary- [[Cordylus|Girdled Tailed Lizard]]s, [[Uromastyx|Mali Spiny Tailed Lizard]]s, and [[Agama agama|Red Headed Rock Agama]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/zoonooz/woodland-wonders/|title=Woodland Wonders|first=Donna|last=Parham|date=May 8, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Madagascar Forest====\n\nThe Madagascar Forest exhibit features [[lemur]] species that the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]]' (AZA) Prosimian Taxon Advisory Group (TAG) has identified as needing sustainability assistance for the North American population. By building this new exhibit, the Zoo will be able to participate in breeding programs that will help ensure healthy populations of lemurs in zoos. The exhibit houses a [[ring-tailed lemur]] family consisting of mom Tweena, dad Mathew, and their baby Bijou along with five other Ring Tailed Lemurs. The [[red ruffed lemur]]s, one of the most endangered primates in the world, include mom Mortica and her baby Ony (Malagasy for \"river\"). The Zoo is hoping their [[Collared brown lemur]] pair Pierre and Zaza will produce offspring. Aykroyd and Belushi, two male [[Blue-eyed black lemur]]s, are still awaiting mates. Ared collard, lemurgrippina, and Thrax are [[Coquerel's sifaka]]s, the final lemur species exhibited in Africa Rocks. Some of the lemur species will be exhibited together even if they do not live with each other in the wild.\n\nAlong with lemurs, the Madagascar Forest exhibit houses the lemurs' main predator the [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] as well as the [[ratel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/zoonooz/for-the-love-of-lemurs/|title=For the Love of Lemurs|first=Donna|last=Parham|date=February 20, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Ethiopian Highlands====\n\nThe Ethiopian Highlands exhibit houses two primate species: the [[gelada]] and the [[Hamadryas baboon]]. The San Diego Zoo is only the second zoo in North America to house geladas, the other facility being the [[Bronx Zoo]] in New York City. Alpha male Juma leads the all-male members including Mahbub, Saburi, Abasi, Diwani, and Valentino. the group arrived at the Zoo on September 7, 2016 from the Wilhelma Zoo in Stuttgart, Germany where they lived with 44 other geladas. This move was based by the European Association of Zoos and Aquariums' (EAZA) European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for geladas\u2014the European equivalent of an Association of Zoos and Aquariums\u2019 (AZA) Species Survival Plan (SSP) program. The bachelor group, who also live with a herd of [[Nubian ibex]], will be introduced to females later on.\n\nThe Ethiopian Highlands exhibit is also home to a troop of Hamadryas baboons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/zoonooz/a-most-unusual-primate/|title=A Most Unusual Primate|first=Donna|last=Parham|date=June 26, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Kopje Woodland====\n\nThe word [[Inselberg|kopje]] in Dutch means \"small head\" which perfectly describes the rock formations that seem to pop out in the savanna. [[Kopjes]] are homes for well adapted animals. The San Diego Zoo's Kopje Woodland in Africa Rocks is home to animals including [[klipspringer]]s, [[rock hyrax]], and the [[dwarf mongoose]]. Each animal has well adapted feet that allow them to cling to the rocks. The exhibit also includes these animals' main predator the [[bateleur]] as well as [[meerkat]]s, [[servals]] and the red-leaved rock fig, a tree species that manages to grow wherever its seeds disperse including the rocky kopje.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/zoonooz/rock-stars-of-the-serengeti/|title=Rock Stars of the Serengeti|first=Peggy|last=Scott|date=May 29, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====West African Forest====\n\nThe West African Forest exhibit features Rady Falls, a 65-foot tall waterfall, the largest man-made waterfall in San Diego. At the base of Rady Falls, West African [[dwarf crocodile]]s reside in a pond. Reaching five feet in length, this is one of the smallest crocodile species.\n\nThe West African Forest exhibit also features [[Madagascan big-headed turtle]]s, [[West African mud turtle]]s and the floating fig tree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/zoonooz/a-forest-to-fall-for/|title=A Forest to \"Fall\" For|first=Eston|last=Ellis|date=July 11, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nThe zoo is active in conservation and species-preservation efforts. Its Institute for Conservation Research (formerly the Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species) raises [[California condor]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[black rhinoceros|black rhinos]], [[polar bear]]s, [[orangutans]], [[peninsular pronghorn]], [[desert tortoise]]s, [[African penguins]], [[mountain yellow-legged frog]]s, [[Pacific pocket mouse|Pacific pocket mice]], [[Francois' langur]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[quino checkerspot butterfly|quino checkerspot butterflies]], [[Hawaiian crow]]s, light-footed [[clapper rail]]s, [[Gray's monitor]]s, [[tree lobster]]s, [[clouded leopard]]s, [[Galapagos tortoises]], [[Blue lorikeet|Tahiti lorikeet]]s, [[lion-tailed macaque]]s, [[mhorr gazelle]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[Przewalski's horse]]s, [[koala]]s, [[burrowing owl]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[Tasmanian devil]]s, [[okapi]], [[Western pond turtle|Southwestern pond turtle]]s, and 145 other [[endangered species]]. As a result, they have reintroduced more than 30 endangered species back into the wild, and have conserved habitat at 50 field sites. They also have over 200 conservation scientists working in 35 countries around the world. It employs numerous professional geneticists, cytologists, and veterinarians and maintains a [[cryopreservation]] facility for rare sperm and eggs called the [[frozen zoo]].\n\nThe San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research is the largest zoo-based multidisciplinary research effort in the world. Based at the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center for Conservation Research adjacent to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, more than 200 dedicated scientists carry out research vital to the conservation of animals, plants, and habitats, locally and internationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegozooglobal.org/campuses |title=SDZ Global Wildlife Conservancy - Who We Are - Campuses |publisher=Sandiegozooglobal.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}</ref>\n\n==Zoo Corps==\nZoo Corps is a volunteer program at the San Diego Zoo that enlists high school students to teach guests at the zoo about the animals they are seeing and their place in the ecosystem. It enrolls students between 13 and 17 years of age. The goals are to promote [[public education]] about animals and [[Conservation movement|conservation]], and to help the students develop their ability to speak in public. The program runs year round in two sessions, one from May through November and one from January through May. Members of the Zoo Corps are expected to volunteer at least once a month.<ref name=\"zoo_corps\">\n{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/zoo/special/zoo_corps\n|title=Zoo Corps: Kids Teaching Kids\n|publisher=San Diego Zoo\n|accessdate=September 10, 2011\n}}</ref>\n\nThe program utilizes a series of \"Kits\", which are set on tables throughout the zoo. The kits contain objects that can be used to explain why an animal is endangered or to shed light on the animal's lifestyle. Some of the kits are: Conservation Kit, Endangered Species Kit, Behavioral Enrichment Kit, and Animal Diet Kit.\n\n==Architecture==\nLocal architect [[Louis John Gill]] designed the original buildings, cages and animal grottos and later in 1926, the [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Revival]]-style research hospital, for which Gill received an Honor Award from the San Diego Chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]]. Gill also designed a bird cage at the zoo in 1937, then the largest bird cage in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/84summer/gill.htm|title=The Journal of San Diego History \"LOUIS JOHN GILL: Famous but Forgotten Architect\", Rev.

There is also an overhead [[gondola lift]] called the Skyfari, providing an aerial view of the zoo. The Skyfari was built in 1969 by the [[Von Roll]] tramway company of [[Bern]], Switzerland. The San Diego Zoo Skyfari is a Von Roll type 101.\n\nExhibits at the zoo are often designed around a particular [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. The same exhibit may feature many different [[Animal|animals]] that can be found side-by-side in the wild, along with native plant life. Exhibits range from an African [[rain forest]] (featuring [[gorilla]]s) to the Arctic [[taiga]] and [[tundra]] in the summertime (featuring [[polar bear]]s).  Some of the largest free-flight [[aviary|aviaries]] in existence are here, including the Owens Aviary and the Scripps Aviary. Many exhibits are \"natural\", with invisible wires and darkened blinds (to view birds), and accessible pools and open-air moats (for large mammals).\n\nThe San Diego Zoo also operates the [[San Diego Zoo Safari Park]], which displays animals in a more expansive, open setting than at the zoo. Animals are regularly exchanged between the two locations, as well as between San Diego Zoo and other zoos around the world, usually in accordance with [[Species Survival Plan]] recommendations.\n\nThe temperate, sunny maritime climate of California is well suited to many plants and animals. Besides an extensive collection of birds, reptiles, and mammals, it also maintains its grounds as an [[arboretum]], with a rare plant collection. The botanical collection includes more than 700,000 exotic plants.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the San Diego Zoo,|url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/disclaimers/aboutus.html|website=sandiegozoo.org|accessdate=January 21, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206132749/http://www.sandiegozoo.org/disclaimers/aboutus.html|archivedate=December 6, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> As part of its gardening effort, some rare animal foods are grown at the zoo.

Elephant Odyssey also features a glimpse of the past, with the Fossil Portal and life-size statues of ancient creatures of Southern California next to exhibits of their modern-day counterparts.  The ancient life represented include the [[Columbian mammoth]], the [[saber-tooth cat]], the [[American lion]], the [[Buteogallus daggetti|Daggett's eagle]], and the [[Megalonyx|Jefferson's ground sloth]].  Elephant Odyssey's other animal exhibits include [[Lion|African lion]]s, [[jaguar]]s, [[Baird's tapir]]s, [[guanaco]]s, [[capybara]]s, [[spur-winged geese]], [[two-toed sloth]]s, [[Kirk's dik-dik]]s, [[secretary bird]]s, [[dung beetle]]s, [[water beetle]]s, desert [[tarantula]]s, [[toad]]s, [[newt]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[frog]]s, [[dromedary camel]]s, [[pronghorn]]s, [[Przewalski's wild horse]]s, [[burro]]s, [[llama]]s, [[rattlesnake]]s, [[western pond turtle]]s, and the [[California condor]].\n\nThe Fossil Portal is an artificial [[tar pit]] that periodically drains to reveal man-made [[Pleistocene]]-era bones. The path turns a corner and opens up at the [[Mammoth]] Passage Plaza, with exhibits for jaguars and African lions to the left, an exhibit that has housed two-toed sloths to the right, and the tip of the elephant exhibit, with a large wading pool, straight ahead. The path continues to the left along the pool, passing by the jaguar exhibit on the left. The northern end of the elephant pool drains into the Mixed Species Exhibit, which houses [[tapir]]s, capybaras, guanacos, & a [[spur-winged goose|goose]]. The path meets up with the elephant exhibit again before it reaches the Elephant Care Center, where visitors can watch keepers care for the animals. Next is an exhibit for secretary birds with grasses, a tree and a statue of the extinct Daggett's eagle nearby. Afterwards, the path goes down a [[crevasse]] with a wall embedded with [[vivarium|vivaria]] for dung beetles and [[diving beetle]]s, among other aquatic insects. The path tunnels below the elephant exhibit to reach the other side, where it continues between the elephant exhibit and a creek for native reptiles and amphibians. Just past the source of the [[stream]] is a restaurant and gift shop, and after that are exhibits for [[pronghorn]]s, [[horse]]s, and [[camel]]s. Next the path splits between a [[playground]], a rattlesnake [[terrarium]], and a California condor aviary with artificial rock spires and a stream.

The exhibit was designed to mimic the giant [[granite]] boulders that are found on [[Boulders Beach]] in South Africa, a place where these birds live. The 70-foot-long and 10-foot-wide habitat also includes a 200,000-gallon pool for the penguins that stretches 170 feet, with depths up to 13 feet. Along with the large pool, the exhibit features a cobblestone beach and a nesting area. A group of 20 penguins moved in on June 22, 2017 to get ready for when the exhibit opened on July 1, 2017.\n\nThe penguins also share their exhibit with [[leopard shark]]s. Twelve leopard sharks arrived at the San Diego Zoo on June 23, 2017 from [[SeaWorld San Diego]]. The sharks were introduced to their exhibit and their penguin neighbors on Wednesday, June 28, 2017.

The leopard exhibit does not feature the [[African leopard|African subspecies]] of leopard, however. [[Amur leopard]]s, from as far as [[Russia]] to Northern [[China]], are exhibited instead. This is because the Amur leopard is [[critically endangered]]- there are around 60 individuals left in the wild. The San Diego Zoo participates in the Amur leopard [[Species Survival Plan|Species Survival Plan,]] a breeding program that focuses on preserving the genetics of this endangered cat. The Acacia Woodland exhibit will allow the Zoo to have more breeding spaces for the cats. The Zoo has a spotted and [[Black panther|black]] Leopard, as well as two new cubs.\n\nAlong with the leopard exhibit, the Acacia Woodland exhibit in Africa Rocks features a [[vervet monkey]] troop. The vervet monkeys are very agile and one of the only primate species that lives in a woodland habitat. The aviary in this exhibit features two species of [[bee eaters]], the [[White-fronted bee-eater|white-fronted]] and [[White-throated bee-eater|white-throated]], as well as [[black-headed weaver]]s and several other bird species. The exhibit also features [[African Silverbill]]s, [[African pygmy goose|African Pygmy Geese]], [[African Jacana]]s, [[Violet-backed starling|Amethyst starling]]s, [[Beautiful Sunbird]]s, [[Blue-naped mousebird]]s, [[Collared Pratincole]]s, [[Common Waxbill]]s, [[Emerald-spotted wood dove]]s, [[Fischer's Lovebird]]s, [[Golden Breasted Starling]]s, [[Greater Painted Snipe]]s, [[Long-tailed paradise whydah]]s, [[Magpie Mannikin]]s, [[Melba Finch]]es, [[Namaqua Dove]]s, [[Pin-tailed whydah]]s, [[Purple Grenadier]]s, [[Red-billed firefinch]]es, [[Red-cheeked cordon-bleu]]s, [[Snowy-crowned robin-chat]]s, [[Stone Partridge]]s, [[Village Indigobird]]s, [[White-bellied go-away-bird]]s, [[White-headed buffalo weaver]]s, [[Yellow-crowned bishop]]s, [[Yellow-necked spurfowl|Yellow Necked Francolin]]s, [[Yellow-mantled widowbird]]s, and [[Zebra Waxbill]]s. There are also three species of lizards in the aviary- [[Cordylus|Girdled Tailed Lizard]]s, [[Uromastyx|Mali Spiny Tailed Lizard]]s, and [[Agama agama|Red Headed Rock Agama]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/zoonooz/woodland-wonders/|title=Woodland Wonders|first=Donna|last=Parham|date=May 8, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Madagascar Forest====\n\nThe Madagascar Forest exhibit features [[lemur]] species that the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]]' (AZA) Prosimian Taxon Advisory Group (TAG) has identified as needing sustainability assistance for the North American population. By building this new exhibit, the Zoo will be able to participate in breeding programs that will help ensure healthy populations of lemurs in zoos. The exhibit houses a [[ring-tailed lemur]] family consisting of mom Tweena, dad Mathew, and their baby Bijou along with five other Ring Tailed Lemurs. The [[red ruffed lemur]]s, one of the most endangered primates in the world, include mom Mortica and her baby Ony (Malagasy for \"river\"). The Zoo is hoping their [[Collared brown lemur]] pair Pierre and Zaza will produce offspring. Aykroyd and Belushi, two male [[Blue-eyed black lemur]]s, are still awaiting mates. Ared collard, lemurgrippina, and Thrax are [[Coquerel's sifaka]]s, the final lemur species exhibited in Africa Rocks. Some of the lemur species will be exhibited together even if they do not live with each other in the wild.\n\nAlong with lemurs, the Madagascar Forest exhibit houses the lemurs' main predator the [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] as well as the [[ratel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/zoonooz/for-the-love-of-lemurs/|title=For the Love of Lemurs|first=Donna|last=Parham|date=February 20, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Ethiopian Highlands====\n\nThe Ethiopian Highlands exhibit houses two primate species: the [[gelada]] and the [[Hamadryas baboon]]. The San Diego Zoo is only the second zoo in North America to house geladas, the other facility being the [[Bronx Zoo]] in New York City. Alpha male Juma leads the all-male members including Mahbub, Saburi, Abasi, Diwani, and Valentino. the group arrived at the Zoo on September 7, 2016 from the Wilhelma Zoo in Stuttgart, Germany where they lived with 44 other geladas. This move was based by the European Association of Zoos and Aquariums' (EAZA) European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for geladas\u2014the European equivalent of an Association of Zoos and Aquariums\u2019 (AZA) Species Survival Plan (SSP) program. The bachelor group, who also live with a herd of [[Nubian ibex]], will be introduced to females later on.\n\nThe Ethiopian Highlands exhibit is also home to a troop of Hamadryas baboons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/zoonooz/a-most-unusual-primate/|title=A Most Unusual Primate|first=Donna|last=Parham|date=June 26, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Kopje Woodland====\n\nThe word [[Inselberg|kopje]] in Dutch means \"small head\" which perfectly describes the rock formations that seem to pop out in the savanna. [[Kopjes]] are homes for well adapted animals. The San Diego Zoo's Kopje Woodland in Africa Rocks is home to animals including [[klipspringer]]s, [[rock hyrax]], and the [[dwarf mongoose]]. Each animal has well adapted feet that allow them to cling to the rocks. The exhibit also includes these animals' main predator the [[bateleur]] as well as [[meerkat]]s, [[servals]] and the red-leaved rock fig, a tree species that manages to grow wherever its seeds disperse including the rocky kopje.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/zoonooz/rock-stars-of-the-serengeti/|title=Rock Stars of the Serengeti|first=Peggy|last=Scott|date=May 29, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====West African Forest====\n\nThe West African Forest exhibit features Rady Falls, a 65-foot tall waterfall, the largest man-made waterfall in San Diego. At the base of Rady Falls, West African [[dwarf crocodile]]s reside in a pond. Reaching five feet in length, this is one of the smallest crocodile species.\n\nThe West African Forest exhibit also features [[Madagascan big-headed turtle]]s, [[West African mud turtle]]s and the floating fig tree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/zoonooz/a-forest-to-fall-for/|title=A Forest to \"Fall\" For|first=Eston|last=Ellis|date=July 11, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nThe zoo is active in conservation and species-preservation efforts. Its Institute for Conservation Research (formerly the Center for Reproduction of Endangered Species) raises [[California condor]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[black rhinoceros|black rhinos]], [[polar bear]]s, [[orangutans]], [[peninsular pronghorn]], [[desert tortoise]]s, [[African penguins]], [[mountain yellow-legged frog]]s, [[Pacific pocket mouse|Pacific pocket mice]], [[Francois' langur]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[quino checkerspot butterfly|quino checkerspot butterflies]], [[Hawaiian crow]]s, light-footed [[clapper rail]]s, [[Gray's monitor]]s, [[tree lobster]]s, [[clouded leopard]]s, [[Galapagos tortoises]], [[Blue lorikeet|Tahiti lorikeet]]s, [[lion-tailed macaque]]s, [[mhorr gazelle]]s, [[gorilla]]s, [[Przewalski's horse]]s, [[koala]]s, [[burrowing owl]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[Tasmanian devil]]s, [[okapi]], [[Western pond turtle|Southwestern pond turtle]]s, and 145 other [[endangered species]]. As a result, they have reintroduced more than 30 endangered species back into the wild, and have conserved habitat at 50 field sites. They also have over 200 conservation scientists working in 35 countries around the world. It employs numerous professional geneticists, cytologists, and veterinarians and maintains a [[cryopreservation]] facility for rare sperm and eggs called the [[frozen zoo]].\n\nThe San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research is the largest zoo-based multidisciplinary research effort in the world. Based at the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center for Conservation Research adjacent to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, more than 200 dedicated scientists carry out research vital to the conservation of animals, plants, and habitats, locally and internationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegozooglobal.org/campuses |title=SDZ Global Wildlife Conservancy - Who We Are - Campuses |publisher=Sandiegozooglobal.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}</ref>\n\n==Zoo Corps==\nZoo Corps is a volunteer program at the San Diego Zoo that enlists high school students to teach guests at the zoo about the animals they are seeing and their place in the ecosystem. It enrolls students between 13 and 17 years of age. The goals are to promote [[public education]] about animals and [[Conservation movement|conservation]], and to help the students develop their ability to speak in public. The program runs year round in two sessions, one from May through November and one from January through May. Members of the Zoo Corps are expected to volunteer at least once a month.<ref name=\"zoo_corps\">\n{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.sandiegozoo.org/zoo/special/zoo_corps\n|title=Zoo Corps: Kids Teaching Kids\n|publisher=San Diego Zoo\n|accessdate=September 10, 2011\n}}</ref>\n\nThe program utilizes a series of \"Kits\", which are set on tables throughout the zoo. The kits contain objects that can be used to explain why an animal is endangered or to shed light on the animal's lifestyle. Some of the kits are: Conservation Kit, Endangered Species Kit, Behavioral Enrichment Kit, and Animal Diet Kit.\n\n==Architecture==\nLocal architect [[Louis John Gill]] designed the original buildings, cages and animal grottos and later in 1926, the [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Revival]]-style research hospital, for which Gill received an Honor Award from the San Diego Chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]]. Gill also designed a bird cage at the zoo in 1937, then the largest bird cage in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/84summer/gill.htm|title=The Journal of San Diego History \"LOUIS JOHN GILL: Famous but Forgotten Architect\", Rev.

Francie very quickly becomes relentlessly dependent on Christine, but Christine doesn't mind: Barb told Christine she 'needed a break' because Christine is too needy and Christine is enjoying being on the other side. It all gets to be too much when Francie asks Christine to give the eulogy at her grandmother's funeral. What does Christine do? She asks Barb to give the eulogy. Matthew moves in with New Christine and Richard while the heater in his room is being fixed.

Modern windows are usually [[glazing (window)|glazed]] or covered in some other [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] or translucent material, a [[Window sash|sash]] set in a frame<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/> in the opening; the sash and frame are also referred to as a window.<ref name=\"Window\">{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/window/ |title=Window |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref> Many glazed windows may be opened, to allow ventilation, or closed, to exclude inclement weather. Windows often have a [[Latch (hardware)|latch]] or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts.\n\nTypes include the eyebrow window, fixed windows, single-hung and double-hung sash windows, horizontal sliding [[sash window]]s, [[casement window]]s, awning windows, hopper windows, tilt and slide windows (often door-sized), tilt and turn windows, transom windows, sidelight windows, jalousie or [[louver]]ed windows, [[clerestory]] windows, skylights, roof windows, roof lanterns, bay windows, oriel windows, thermal, or Diocletian, windows, picture windows, emergency exit windows, [[stained glass]] windows, French windows, panel windows, and double - and triple paned windows.\n\nThe Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]], in [[Alexandria]] ca. 100 AD. Paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In [[England]], glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened [[animal horn]] were used as early as the 14th century. In the 19th century American west, [[greased paper window]]s came to be used by itinerant groups. Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial [[plate glass|plate]] [[Glass production|glass making]] processes were fully perfected.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English language-word ''window'' originates from the [[Old Norse]] 'vindauga', from 'vindr{{snd}} wind' and 'auga{{snd}} eye', i.e., ''wind eye''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com |title=New Oxford American Dictionary |date=2010}}</ref> In [[Norwegian Language|Norwegian]] [[Nynorsk]] and [[Icelandic Language|Icelandic]] the Old Norse form has survived to this day (in Icelandic only as a less used word for a type of small open \"window\", not strictly a synonym for ''gluggi'', the Icelandic word for window<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=71376|title=Hva\u00f0an kemur or\u00f0i\u00f0 gluggi? Af hverju notum vi\u00f0 ekki vindauga samanber window?|work=V\u00edsindavefurinn|access-date=2018-09-17|language=is}}</ref>), in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] the word ''vind\u00f6ga'' remains as a term for a hole through the roof of a hut, and in the Danish language 'vindue' and Norwegian [[Bokm\u00e5l]] 'vindu', the direct link to 'eye' is lost, just like for 'window'. The Danish (but not the Bokm\u00e5l) word is pronounced fairly similarly to ''window''.\n\n''Window'' is first recorded in the early 13th century, and originally referred to an unglazed hole in a roof. ''Window'' replaced the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''eag\u00feyrl'', which literally means 'eye-hole,' and 'eagduru' 'eye-door'. Many Germanic languages however adopted the Latin word 'fenestra' to describe a window with glass, such as [[Standard language|standard]] [[Swedish language|Swedish]] 'f\u00f6nster', or [[German language|German]] 'Fenster'. The use of ''window'' in English is probably because of the Scandinavian influence on the English language by means of [[loanwords]] during the [[Viking Age]].  In English the word ''fenester'' was used as a parallel until the mid-18th century. ''Fenestration'' is still used to describe the arrangement of windows within a [[fa\u00e7ade]], as well as ''[[defenestration]]'', meaning to throw something out of a window.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roman window glass.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a Roman window glass plate dated to 1st to 4th century A.D.<br />Note the obvious curvature; this is not a flat pane.]]\n[[File:MorellaSantaMariaWindow.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Alabaster]] \"mullion\"-divided decorative windows in Santa Maria La Major church ([[Morella, Castell\u00f3n|Morella]], Spain).]]\n[[File:ValenciaCathedral2.JPG|thumb|upright|Alabaster window in the [[Valencia Cathedral]]. Note the asymmetrical, slanted left side of the wall-frame, which lets sun rays reach the chancel.]]\nIn the 13th century BC, the earliest windows were unglazed openings in a roof to admit light during the day. Later,{{when|date=October 2016}} windows were covered with animal hide, cloth, or wood. [[Window shutter|Shutters]] that could be opened and closed came next.{{when|date=October 2016}} Over time, windows were built that both protected the inhabitants from the elements and transmitted light, using multiple small pieces of translucent material, such as flattened pieces of translucent animal horn, thin slices of [[marble]], for example [[fengite]], or pieces of glass, set in frameworks of wood, iron or lead. In the Far East, paper was used to fill windows.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{cite encyclopedia| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/645175/window |title=Window\n|encyclopedia=Britannica|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>\nThe Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in Roman Egypt. Namely, in Alexandria ca. 100 AD cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical properties, began to appear, but these were small thick productions, little more than [[glass blowing|blown glass]] jars (cylindrical shapes) flattened out into sheets with circular striation patterns throughout. It would be over a millennium before a window glass became transparent enough to see through clearly, as we think of it now.\n\nOver the centuries techniques were developed to shear through one side of a blown glass [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] and produce thinner rectangular window panes from the same amount of glass material. This gave rise to tall narrow windows, usually separated by a vertical support called a mullion. [[Mullion]]ed glass windows were the windows of choice among [[Europe]]an well-to-do, whereas paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Langley|first=Andrew|title=Medieval Life|series=Eyewitness|year=2011|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=1-4053-4545-4|page=16}}</ref>\n\nModern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial [[plate glass|plate]] [[Glass production|glass making]] processes were perfected. Modern windows are usually filled with glass, although a few are transparent plastic.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n==Types==\n===Cross===\nA [[cross-window]] is a rectangular window usually divided into four lights by a mullion and transom that form a [[Latin cross]].<ref>Curl, James Stevens (2006). ''Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture'', 2nd ed., OUP, Oxford and New York, p. 214. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860678-9}}.</ref>\n\n===Eyebrow===\nThe term eyebrow window is used in two ways: a curved top window in a wall or in an eyebrow [[dormer]]; and a row of small windows usually under the front eaves such as the [[James-Lorah House]] in Pennsylvania.<ref>Harris, Cyril M.. ''American architecture: an illustrated encyclopedia''. New York: W.W. Norton, 1998. Print.</ref>\n\n===Fixed===\nA fixed window is a window that cannot be opened,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVTjAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA83&dq=Fixed+window+is+window+that+cannot+open&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjF5Ma_5bvUAhUUH2MKHVJOC_UQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&q=Fixed%20window%20is%20window%20that%20cannot%20open&f=false|title=Kitchen & Bath Residential Construction and Systems|last=Association)|first=NKBA (National Kitchen and Bath|date=2013-10-29|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118711040|language=en}}</ref> whose function is limited to allowing light to enter (unlike an unfixed window, which can open and close). Clerestory windows in [[church architecture]] are often fixed. Transom windows may be fixed or operable. This type of window is used in situations where light or vision alone is needed as no ventilation is possible in such windows without the use of [[trickle vent]]s or overglass vents.\n\n===Single-hung sash===\nA single-hung sash window is a window that has one sash that is movable (usually the bottom one) and the other fixed. This is the earlier form of sliding sash window, and is also cheaper.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n===Double-hung sash===\nA [[sash window]] is the traditional style of window in the United Kingdom, and many other places that were formerly colonized by the UK, with two parts (sashes) that overlap slightly and slide up and down inside the frame. The two parts are not necessarily the same size; where the upper sash is smaller (shorter) it is termed a [[cottage window]]. Currently most new double-hung sash windows use spring balances to support the sashes, but traditionally, counterweights held in boxes on either side of the window were used. These were and are attached to the sashes using pulleys of either braided cord or, later, purpose-made chain. Three types of spring balances are called a tape or clock spring balance; channel or block-and-tackle balance; and a spiral or tube balance.\n\nDouble-hung sash windows were traditionally often fitted with [[Window shutter|shutters]]. Sash windows can be fitted with simplex hinges that let the window be locked into hinges on one side, while the rope on the other side is detached\u2014so the window can be opened for fire escape or cleaning.\n\n<br />\n===Foldup===\n[[File:Foldup window.gif|thumb|Foldup window (inward swinging)]]\nA foldup has two equal sashes similar to a standard double hung, but folds upward allowing air to pass through nearly the full frame opening. The window is balanced using either springs or counterbalances, similar to a double hung. The sashes can be either offset to simulate a double hung, or in-line. The inline versions can be made to fold inward or outward. The inward swinging foldup windows can have fixed screens, while the outward swinging ones require movable screens. The windows are typically used for screen rooms, kitchen pass-throughs, or for egress.\n\n===Horizontal sliding sash===\nA horizontal sliding sash window has two or more sashes that overlap slightly but slide horizontally within the frame. In the UK, these are sometimes called ''[[Yorkshire]]'' sash windows, presumably because of their traditional use in that county.\n\n===Casement===\n{{main|Casement window}}\n[[File:Gordijnen aan venster.JPG|thumb|[[Casement window]]]]\n\nA casement window is a window with a hinged sash that swings in or out like a door comprising either a side-hung, top-hung (also called \"awning window\"; see below), or occasionally bottom-hung sash or a combination of these types, sometimes with fixed panels on one or more sides of the sash.<ref name=\"Window\"/> In the USA, these are usually opened using a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]], but in parts of Europe they tend to use projection friction stays and [[espagnolette]] locking. Formerly, plain hinges were used with a [[casement stay]]. [[Handing]] applies to casement windows to determine direction of swing; a casement window may be left-handed, right-handed, or double. The casement window is the dominant type now found in modern buildings in the UK and many other parts of Europe.\n\n====Awning====\n[[File:Fen\u00eatre \u00e0 l'australienne - Awning window - (AWS Magnum 616) Light.jpg|thumb|upright|Awning window]]\nAn awning window is a casement window that is hung horizontally, [[hinge]]d on top, so that it swings outward like an [[awning]]. In addition to be used independently, they can be stacked, several in one opening, or combined with fixed glass. They are particularly useful for ventilation.<ref>{{cite book | title=Window Treatments | first=Karla J. | last=Nielson | page=45 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6U0uP5cyLQC&pg=PA45&dq=%22awning+window%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLgJCejrbLAhVU3mMKHWJmBJUQ6AEINTAA#v=onepage&q=%22awning%20window%22&f=false | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | date=Sep 15, 1989 | isbn=0471289469}}</ref>\n\n====Hopper====\nA hopper window is a bottom-pivoting casement window that opens by tilting vertically, typically to the inside.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Edward|last2=Thallon|first2=Rob|title=Fundamentals of Residential Construction|edition=3|year=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-54083-1|page=654}}</ref>\n\n===Pivot===\nA pivot window is a window hung on one hinge on each of two opposite sides which allows the window to revolve when opened. The hinges may be mounted top and bottom  (Vertically Pivoted) or at each jamb (Horizontally Pivoted). The window will usually open initially to a restricted position for ventilation and, once released, fully reverse and lock again for safe cleaning from inside. Modern pivot hinges incorporate a friction device to hold the window open against its own weight and may have restriction and reversed locking built in. In the UK, where this type of window is most common, they were extensively installed in high-rise social housing.\n\n===Tilt and slide===\nA tilt and slide window is a window (more usually a door-sized window) where the sash tilts inwards at the top and then slides horizontally behind the fixed pane.\n\n====Tilt and turn====\nA ''tilt and turn'' window can both tilt inwards at the top or open inwards from hinges at the side. This is the most common type of window in Germany, its country of origin. It is also widespread in many other European countries. In Europe it is usual for these to be of the \"turn first\" type. i.e. when the handle is turned to 90 degrees the window opens in the side hung mode. With the handle turned to 180 degrees the window opens in bottom hung mode. Most usually in the UK the windows will be \"tilt first\" i.e. bottom hung at 90 degrees for ventilation and side hung at 180 degrees for cleaning the outer face of the glass from inside the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windowanddoor.com/article/products/will-tilt-and-turn-windows-gain-market-share-north-america?page=0%2C1 |title=Will Tilt-and-Turn Windows Gain Market Share in North America? &#124; Window & Door |publisher=Windowanddoor.com |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Transom===\nA window above a door; in an exterior door the [[Transom (architectural)|''transom]] window is often fixed, in an interior door it can open either by hinges at top or bottom, or rotate on hinges. It provided ventilation before forced air heating and cooling. A fan-shaped transom is known as a fanlight, especially in the British Isles.\n\n===Side light===\nWindows beside a door or window are called ''side''-, ''wing''-, and ''margen-lights'' and ''flanking windows''.<ref>Curl, James Stevens. \"Flanking window\".

Print.</ref>\n\n===Jalousie window===\n[[File:Jalousie2.jpg|thumb|Jalousie or [[louver]]ed window]]\n\nAlso known as a [[louver]]ed window, the [[jalousie window]] consists of parallel slats of glass or [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|acrylic]] that open and close like a [[Venetian blind]], usually using a crank or a lever. They are used extensively in tropical architecture. A jalousie door is a door with a jalousie window.\n\n[[File:Paris 12-22 (16249805806).jpg|thumb|[[Clerestory]] windows in the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] (Paris)]]\n\n===Clerestory===\n{{main|Clerestory}}\nA clerestory window is a window set in a [[roof]] structure or high in a wall, used for [[daylighting]].\n\n===Skylight===\n{{main|Daylighting}}\n[[File:BurlingtonHousePavementWindow.jpg|thumbnail|Sidewalk skylight (also named '[[pavement light]]') outside [[Burlington House]], [[London]]]]\n\nA skylight is a window built into a roof structure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TopgKO4x_2kC&pg=PA223&dq=skylight+is+window+built+into+roof&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigkYOY5rvUAhVK1GMKHSqJBt8Q6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&q=skylight%20is%20window%20built%20into%20roof&f=false|title=Construction Estimating Reference Data|last=Sarviel|first=Ed|date=1993|publisher=Craftsman Book Company|isbn=9780934041843|language=en}}</ref> This type of window allows for natural daylight and moonlight.\n\n===Roof===\n[[File:EdenProjectRoof.jpg|thumbnail|Hexagonal external cladding panels of roof in [[Eden Project]] Biomes ([[Cornwall]], England,)]]\nA sloped window used for [[daylighting]], built into a roof structure.

It projects from the wall and does not extend to the ground. Originally a form of porch, they are often supported by brackets or corbels.\n\n===Thermal===\n{{main|Diocletian window}}\nThermal, or Diocletian, windows are large semicircular windows (or niches) which are usually divided into three lights (window compartments) by two mullions. The central compartment is often wider than the two side lights on either side of it.\n\n===Picture===\nA picture window is a large fixed window in a wall, typically without glazing bars, or glazed with only perfunctory glazing bars ([[muntin]]s) near the edge of the window. Picture windows provide an unimpeded view, as if framing a picture.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/picture+window |title=Picture window |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Multi-lite===\nA multi-lite window is a window glazed with small panes of glass separated by wooden or lead ''glazing bars'', or ''[[muntins]]'', arranged in a decorative ''glazing pattern'' often dictated by the building's architectural style. Due to the historic unavailability of large panes of glass, the multi-lit (or ''lattice window'') was the most common window style until the beginning of the 20th century, and is still used in traditional architecture.\n\n===Emergency exit/egress===\nAn emergency exit window is a window big enough and low enough so that occupants can escape through the opening in an emergency, such as a [[fire]]. In many countries, exact specifications for emergency windows in bedrooms are given in many [[building codes]]. Specifications for such windows may also allow for the entrance of emergency rescuers. Vehicles, such as [[bus]]es and [[aircraft]], frequently have emergency exit windows as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/documents/outreach/bus/PreTrip-SafetyBrochure-Pull.pdf |title=U.S. Dept. of Transportation: Safety information for bus/motorcoach passengers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Stained glass===\n[[File:Nasir-al molk -1.jpg|thumb|left|Sunlight shining through stained glass, [[Nasir-ol-molk Mosque]], [[Shiraz]], Iran]]\n{{main|stained glass}}\nA stained glass window is a window composed of pieces of colored glass, [[transparency (optics)|transparent, translucent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], frequently portraying persons or scenes.

Such windows provide a marked improvement in thermal insulation (and usually in acoustic insulation as well) and are resistant to fogging and frosting caused by temperature differential. They are widely used for residential and commercial construction in intemperate climates. Triple-paned windows have been commercially manufactured and marketed with claims of additional benefit but have not become common. In the UK double-paned and triple-paned are referred to as double-glazing and triple-glazing.\n\n===Hexagonal window===\n{{main|hexagonal window}}\n\nA hexagonal window is a hexagon-shaped window, resembling a bee cell or crystal lattice of graphite. The window can be vertically or horizontally oriented, openable or dead. It can also be regular or elongately-shaped and can have a separator ([[mullion]]). Typically, the cellular window is used for an attic or as a decorative feature, but it can also be a major architectural element to provide the natural lighting inside buildings.\n\n==Terms==\nEN 12519 is the European standard that describes windows terms officially used in EU Member States.\nThe main terms are:\n[[File:Casement (PSF).jpg|thumb|Casement window, with [[Latticework|latticed]] lights]]\n* '''Light''', or '''Lite''', is the area between the outer parts of a window ([[Transom (architectural)|transom]], sill and jambs), usually filled with a glass pane.  Multiple panes are divided by [[mullion]]s when load-bearing, [[muntin]]s when not.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brett |first=Peter |year=2004 |title=Carpentry and Joinery |edition=2, illustrated |publisher=Nelson Thornes |isbn=9780748785025 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=iVthU6rPGK8C&pg=PA225#v=onepage&q&f=false 255]}}</ref>\n* '''Lattice light''' is a compound window pane madeup of small pieces of glass held together in a [[Latticework|lattice]].\n* '''Fixed window''' is a unit of one non-moving lite. The terms ''single-light'', ''double-light'', etc., refer to the number of these glass panes in a window.\n* '''Sash unit''' is a window consisting of at least one sliding glass component, typically composed of two lites (known as a ''double-light'').\n* '''Replacement window''' in the United States means a framed window designed to slip inside the original window frame from the inside after the old sashes are removed. In Europe it usually means a complete window including a replacement outer frame.\n* '''New construction window''', in the US, means a window with a nailing fin that is inserted into a rough opening from the outside before applying siding and inside trim. A nailing fin is a projection on the outer frame of the window in the same plane as the [[glazing in architecture|glazing]], which overlaps the prepared opening, and can thus be 'nailed' into place.\n\n:In the UK and mainland Europe, windows in new-build houses are usually fixed with long screws into expanding plastic plugs in the brickwork.  A gap of up to 13 mm is left around all four sides, and filled with expanding [[polyurethane foam]].  This makes the window fixing weatherproof but allows for expansion due to heat.\n* '''[[Lintel]]''' is a beam over the top of a window, also known as a [[transom (architectural)|transom]].\n* '''[[Window sill]]''' is the bottom piece in a window frame. Window sills slant outward to drain water away from the inside of the building.\n* '''Secondary glazing''' is an additional frame applied to the inside of an existing frame, usually used on protected or listed buildings to achieve higher levels of thermal and sound insulation without compromising the look of the building\n* '''[[Millwork (building material)|Decorative millwork]]''' is the moulding, cornices and lintels often decorating the surrounding edges of the window.\n\n===Labeling===\nThe United States [[National Fenestration Rating Council|NFRC]] Window Label lists the following terms:\n* [[Thermal conductivity|Thermal transmittance (U-factor)]], best values are around U-0.15 (equal to 0.8 W/m2/K)\n* [[Solar heat gain coefficient]] (SHGC), ratio of solar heat (infrared) passing through the glass to incident solar heat\n* [[Visible transmittance]] (VT), ratio of transmitted visible light divided by incident visible light\n* [[airflow|Air leakage]] (AL), measured in cubic foot per minute per linear foot of crack between sash and frame\n* [[Damp (structural)#Condensation|Condensation resistance]] (CR), measured between 1 and 100 (the higher the number, the higher the resistance of the formation of condensation)<ref>[http://www.nfrc.org/documents/WindowsandHeatLoss.pdf Windows and Heat Loss], [[NFRC]] Heat Loss Fact Sheet</ref>\n\nThe European harmonised standard hEN 14351-1, which deals with doors and windows, defines 23 characteristics (divided into ''essential'' and ''non ''essential''.

In older windows, large panes of glass were quite expensive, so muntins let smaller panes fill a larger space. In modern windows, light-colored muntins still provide a useful function by reflecting some of the light going through the window, making the window itself a source of diffuse light (instead of just the surfaces and objects illuminated within the room).  By increasing the indirect illumination of surfaces near the window, muntins tend to brighten the area immediately around a window and reduce the contrast of shadows within the room.\n\n===Frame and sash construction===\n\nFrames and sashes can be made of the following materials:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Because PVC is not as strong as other materials, some PVC frames are reinforced with metal or composite materials to improve their structural strength.\n:**Modern aluminium window frames are typically separated by a [[thermal break]] made of a glass fibre reinforced polyamide. With a 34&nbsp;mm thermal insulation profile it is possible to reach Uf= 1.3&nbsp;W/m\u00b2K for a metal window. This greatly increases thermal resistance, while retaining virtually all of the structural strength.\n\n[[composite material|Composites]] (also known as Hybrid Windows) are start since early 1998 and combine materials like aluminium + pvc or wood to obtain aesthetics of one material with the functional benefits of another.\n[[File:Bleekman zimmer.jpg|thumb|A typical installation of insulated glazing windows with uPVC window frames.]]\nA special class of PVC window frames, uPVC window frames, became widespread since the late 20th century, particularly in Europe: there were 83.5 million installed by 1998<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pritchard|first1=Geoffrey|title=Novel and Traditional Fillers for Plastics: Technology and Market Developments|year=1999|publisher=iSmithers Rapra Publishing|isbn=9781859571835|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3GWoyuMEckC&pg=PA95}}</ref> with numbers still growing as of 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/Vinyl_doors_market/vinyl_windows_market/prweb9415523.htm|title=Global Vinyl Windows Market to Reach 163 Million Units by 2017, According to a New Report by Global Industry Analysts, Inc. |publisher=PRWeb|date=April 18, 2012|accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Glazing and filling===\n\n[[Low-emissivity]] coated panes reduce heat transfer by [[radiation]], which, depending on which surface is coated, helps prevent heat loss (in cold climates) or heat gains (in warm climates).\n\nHigh thermal resistance can be obtained by evacuating or filling the insulated glazing units with gases such as [[argon]] or [[krypton]], which reduces [[Heat conduction|conductive]] heat transfer due to their low thermal conductivity. Performance of such units depends on good window seals and meticulous frame construction to prevent entry of air and loss of efficiency.\n\nModern double-pane and triple-pane windows often include one or more low-e coatings to reduce the window's U-factor (its insulation value, specifically its rate of heat loss). In general, soft-coat low-e coatings tend to result in a lower solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) than hard-coat low-e coatings.\n\nModern windows are usually glazed with one large sheet of glass per sash, while windows in the past were glazed with multiple panes separated by ''glazing bars'', or ''muntins'', due to the unavailability of large sheets of glass. Today, glazing bars tend to be decorative, separating windows into small panes of glass even though larger panes of glass are available, generally in a pattern dictated by the architectural style at use. Glazing bars are typically wooden, but occasionally lead glazing bars soldered in place are used for more intricate glazing patterns.\n\n===Other construction details===\n\nMany windows have movable [[window covering]]s such as [[blinds]] or [[curtain]]s to keep out light, provide additional insulation, or ensure privacy.\nWindows allow natural light to enter, but too much can have negative effects such as glare and heat gain. Additionally, while windows let the user see outside, there must be a way to maintain privacy on in the inside.<ref name=\"Design Evaluation Project\">Howell, Sandra C. (1976). ''Designing for the Elderly; Windows''. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Department of Architecture. Design Evaluation Project.</ref> Window coverings are practical accommodations for these issues.\n\n==Impact of the sun==\n{{main|Daylighting}}\n\n===Sun incidence angle===\n\nHistorically, windows are designed with surfaces parallel to vertical building walls.  Such a design allows considerable solar light and heat penetration due to the most commonly occurring incidence of sun angles. In [[passive solar building design]], an extended [[eave]] is typically used to control the amount of solar light and heat entering the window(s).\n\nAn alternative method is to calculate an optimum window mounting angle that accounts for summer sun load minimization, with consideration of actual latitude of the building. This process has been implemented, for example, in the [[Dakin Building]] in [[Brisbane, California]]\u2014in which most of the fenestration is designed to reflect summer heat load and help prevent summer interior [[over-illumination]] and glare, by canting windows to nearly a 45 degree angle.\n\n===Solar window===\n{{Main|Photovoltaics}}\n\nPhotovoltaic windows not only provide a clear view and illuminate rooms, but also convert sunlight to electricity for the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2008/mit-opens-new-window-solar-energy/|title=MIT opens new 'window' on solar energy |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref> In most cases, translucent photovoltaic cells are used.\n\n===Passive solar===\n\nPassive solar windows allow light and solar energy into a building while minimizing air leakage and heat loss. Properly positioning these windows in relation to sun, wind, and landscape\u2014while properly shading them to limit excess heat gain in summer and shoulder seasons, and providing thermal mass to absorb energy during the day and release it when temperatures cool at night\u2014increases comfort and energy efficiency. Properly designed in climates with adequate solar gain, these can even be a building's primary heating system.\n\n===Coverings===\n\nA [[window covering]] is a shade or screen that provides multiple functions. Some coverings, such as drapes and blinds provide occupants with privacy. Some window coverings control solar heat gain and glare. There are external shading devices and internal shading devices.<ref name=\"Windows\">Beckett, H. E., & Godfrey, J. A. (1974). ''Windows: Performance, design and installation''.

Windows often have a [[Latch (hardware)|latch]] or similar mechanism to lock the window shut or to hold it open by various amounts.\n\nTypes include the eyebrow window, fixed windows, single-hung and double-hung sash windows, horizontal sliding [[sash window]]s, [[casement window]]s, awning windows, hopper windows, tilt and slide windows (often door-sized), tilt and turn windows, transom windows, sidelight windows, jalousie or [[louver]]ed windows, [[clerestory]] windows, skylights, roof windows, roof lanterns, bay windows, oriel windows, thermal, or Diocletian, windows, picture windows, emergency exit windows, [[stained glass]] windows, French windows, panel windows, and double - and triple paned windows.\n\nThe Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]], in [[Alexandria]] ca. 100 AD. Paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In [[England]], glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened [[animal horn]] were used as early as the 14th century. In the 19th century American west, [[greased paper window]]s came to be used by itinerant groups. Modern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial [[plate glass|plate]] [[Glass production|glass making]] processes were fully perfected.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English language-word ''window'' originates from the [[Old Norse]] 'vindauga', from 'vindr{{snd}} wind' and 'auga{{snd}} eye', i.e., ''wind eye''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com |title=New Oxford American Dictionary |date=2010}}</ref> In [[Norwegian Language|Norwegian]] [[Nynorsk]] and [[Icelandic Language|Icelandic]] the Old Norse form has survived to this day (in Icelandic only as a less used word for a type of small open \"window\", not strictly a synonym for ''gluggi'', the Icelandic word for window<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.visindavefur.is/svar.php?id=71376|title=Hva\u00f0an kemur or\u00f0i\u00f0 gluggi?

The Danish (but not the Bokm\u00e5l) word is pronounced fairly similarly to ''window''.\n\n''Window'' is first recorded in the early 13th century, and originally referred to an unglazed hole in a roof. ''Window'' replaced the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''eag\u00feyrl'', which literally means 'eye-hole,' and 'eagduru' 'eye-door'. Many Germanic languages however adopted the Latin word 'fenestra' to describe a window with glass, such as [[Standard language|standard]] [[Swedish language|Swedish]] 'f\u00f6nster', or [[German language|German]] 'Fenster'. The use of ''window'' in English is probably because of the Scandinavian influence on the English language by means of [[loanwords]] during the [[Viking Age]].  In English the word ''fenester'' was used as a parallel until the mid-18th century. ''Fenestration'' is still used to describe the arrangement of windows within a [[fa\u00e7ade]], as well as ''[[defenestration]]'', meaning to throw something out of a window.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roman window glass.jpg|thumb|upright|Fragment of a Roman window glass plate dated to 1st to 4th century A.D.<br />Note the obvious curvature; this is not a flat pane.]]\n[[File:MorellaSantaMariaWindow.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Alabaster]] \"mullion\"-divided decorative windows in Santa Maria La Major church ([[Morella, Castell\u00f3n|Morella]], Spain).]]\n[[File:ValenciaCathedral2.JPG|thumb|upright|Alabaster window in the [[Valencia Cathedral]]. Note the asymmetrical, slanted left side of the wall-frame, which lets sun rays reach the chancel.]]\nIn the 13th century BC, the earliest windows were unglazed openings in a roof to admit light during the day. Later,{{when|date=October 2016}} windows were covered with animal hide, cloth, or wood. [[Window shutter|Shutters]] that could be opened and closed came next.{{when|date=October 2016}} Over time, windows were built that both protected the inhabitants from the elements and transmitted light, using multiple small pieces of translucent material, such as flattened pieces of translucent animal horn, thin slices of [[marble]], for example [[fengite]], or pieces of glass, set in frameworks of wood, iron or lead. In the Far East, paper was used to fill windows.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{cite encyclopedia| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/645175/window |title=Window\n|encyclopedia=Britannica|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>\nThe Romans were the first known to use glass for windows, a technology likely first produced in Roman Egypt. Namely, in Alexandria ca. 100 AD cast glass windows, albeit with poor optical properties, began to appear, but these were small thick productions, little more than [[glass blowing|blown glass]] jars (cylindrical shapes) flattened out into sheets with circular striation patterns throughout. It would be over a millennium before a window glass became transparent enough to see through clearly, as we think of it now.\n\nOver the centuries techniques were developed to shear through one side of a blown glass [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] and produce thinner rectangular window panes from the same amount of glass material. This gave rise to tall narrow windows, usually separated by a vertical support called a mullion. [[Mullion]]ed glass windows were the windows of choice among [[Europe]]an well-to-do, whereas paper windows were economical and widely used in ancient [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Japan]]. In England, glass became common in the windows of ordinary homes only in the early 17th century whereas windows made up of panes of flattened animal horn were used as early as the 14th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Langley|first=Andrew|title=Medieval Life|series=Eyewitness|year=2011|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|isbn=1-4053-4545-4|page=16}}</ref>\n\nModern-style floor-to-ceiling windows became possible only after the industrial [[plate glass|plate]] [[Glass production|glass making]] processes were perfected. Modern windows are usually filled with glass, although a few are transparent plastic.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n==Types==\n===Cross===\nA [[cross-window]] is a rectangular window usually divided into four lights by a mullion and transom that form a [[Latin cross]].<ref>Curl, James Stevens (2006). ''Oxford Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture'', 2nd ed., OUP, Oxford and New York, p. 214. {{ISBN|978-0-19-860678-9}}.</ref>\n\n===Eyebrow===\nThe term eyebrow window is used in two ways: a curved top window in a wall or in an eyebrow [[dormer]]; and a row of small windows usually under the front eaves such as the [[James-Lorah House]] in Pennsylvania.<ref>Harris, Cyril M.. ''American architecture: an illustrated encyclopedia''. New York: W.W. Norton, 1998. Print.</ref>\n\n===Fixed===\nA fixed window is a window that cannot be opened,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVTjAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA83&dq=Fixed+window+is+window+that+cannot+open&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjF5Ma_5bvUAhUUH2MKHVJOC_UQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&q=Fixed%20window%20is%20window%20that%20cannot%20open&f=false|title=Kitchen & Bath Residential Construction and Systems|last=Association)|first=NKBA (National Kitchen and Bath|date=2013-10-29|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781118711040|language=en}}</ref> whose function is limited to allowing light to enter (unlike an unfixed window, which can open and close). Clerestory windows in [[church architecture]] are often fixed. Transom windows may be fixed or operable. This type of window is used in situations where light or vision alone is needed as no ventilation is possible in such windows without the use of [[trickle vent]]s or overglass vents.\n\n===Single-hung sash===\nA single-hung sash window is a window that has one sash that is movable (usually the bottom one) and the other fixed. This is the earlier form of sliding sash window, and is also cheaper.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n===Double-hung sash===\nA [[sash window]] is the traditional style of window in the United Kingdom, and many other places that were formerly colonized by the UK, with two parts (sashes) that overlap slightly and slide up and down inside the frame. The two parts are not necessarily the same size; where the upper sash is smaller (shorter) it is termed a [[cottage window]]. Currently most new double-hung sash windows use spring balances to support the sashes, but traditionally, counterweights held in boxes on either side of the window were used. These were and are attached to the sashes using pulleys of either braided cord or, later, purpose-made chain. Three types of spring balances are called a tape or clock spring balance; channel or block-and-tackle balance; and a spiral or tube balance.\n\nDouble-hung sash windows were traditionally often fitted with [[Window shutter|shutters]]. Sash windows can be fitted with simplex hinges that let the window be locked into hinges on one side, while the rope on the other side is detached\u2014so the window can be opened for fire escape or cleaning.\n\n<br />\n===Foldup===\n[[File:Foldup window.gif|thumb|Foldup window (inward swinging)]]\nA foldup has two equal sashes similar to a standard double hung, but folds upward allowing air to pass through nearly the full frame opening. The window is balanced using either springs or counterbalances, similar to a double hung. The sashes can be either offset to simulate a double hung, or in-line. The inline versions can be made to fold inward or outward. The inward swinging foldup windows can have fixed screens, while the outward swinging ones require movable screens. The windows are typically used for screen rooms, kitchen pass-throughs, or for egress.\n\n===Horizontal sliding sash===\nA horizontal sliding sash window has two or more sashes that overlap slightly but slide horizontally within the frame. In the UK, these are sometimes called ''[[Yorkshire]]'' sash windows, presumably because of their traditional use in that county.\n\n===Casement===\n{{main|Casement window}}\n[[File:Gordijnen aan venster.JPG|thumb|[[Casement window]]]]\n\nA casement window is a window with a hinged sash that swings in or out like a door comprising either a side-hung, top-hung (also called \"awning window\"; see below), or occasionally bottom-hung sash or a combination of these types, sometimes with fixed panels on one or more sides of the sash.<ref name=\"Window\"/> In the USA, these are usually opened using a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]], but in parts of Europe they tend to use projection friction stays and [[espagnolette]] locking. Formerly, plain hinges were used with a [[casement stay]]. [[Handing]] applies to casement windows to determine direction of swing; a casement window may be left-handed, right-handed, or double. The casement window is the dominant type now found in modern buildings in the UK and many other parts of Europe.\n\n====Awning====\n[[File:Fen\u00eatre \u00e0 l'australienne - Awning window - (AWS Magnum 616) Light.jpg|thumb|upright|Awning window]]\nAn awning window is a casement window that is hung horizontally, [[hinge]]d on top, so that it swings outward like an [[awning]]. In addition to be used independently, they can be stacked, several in one opening, or combined with fixed glass. They are particularly useful for ventilation.<ref>{{cite book | title=Window Treatments | first=Karla J. | last=Nielson | page=45 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y6U0uP5cyLQC&pg=PA45&dq=%22awning+window%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjLgJCejrbLAhVU3mMKHWJmBJUQ6AEINTAA#v=onepage&q=%22awning%20window%22&f=false | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | date=Sep 15, 1989 | isbn=0471289469}}</ref>\n\n====Hopper====\nA hopper window is a bottom-pivoting casement window that opens by tilting vertically, typically to the inside.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Edward|last2=Thallon|first2=Rob|title=Fundamentals of Residential Construction|edition=3|year=2011|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-54083-1|page=654}}</ref>\n\n===Pivot===\nA pivot window is a window hung on one hinge on each of two opposite sides which allows the window to revolve when opened. The hinges may be mounted top and bottom  (Vertically Pivoted) or at each jamb (Horizontally Pivoted). The window will usually open initially to a restricted position for ventilation and, once released, fully reverse and lock again for safe cleaning from inside. Modern pivot hinges incorporate a friction device to hold the window open against its own weight and may have restriction and reversed locking built in. In the UK, where this type of window is most common, they were extensively installed in high-rise social housing.\n\n===Tilt and slide===\nA tilt and slide window is a window (more usually a door-sized window) where the sash tilts inwards at the top and then slides horizontally behind the fixed pane.\n\n====Tilt and turn====\nA ''tilt and turn'' window can both tilt inwards at the top or open inwards from hinges at the side. This is the most common type of window in Germany, its country of origin. It is also widespread in many other European countries. In Europe it is usual for these to be of the \"turn first\" type. i.e. when the handle is turned to 90 degrees the window opens in the side hung mode. With the handle turned to 180 degrees the window opens in bottom hung mode. Most usually in the UK the windows will be \"tilt first\" i.e. bottom hung at 90 degrees for ventilation and side hung at 180 degrees for cleaning the outer face of the glass from inside the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windowanddoor.com/article/products/will-tilt-and-turn-windows-gain-market-share-north-america?page=0%2C1 |title=Will Tilt-and-Turn Windows Gain Market Share in North America? &#124; Window & Door |publisher=Windowanddoor.com |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Transom===\nA window above a door; in an exterior door the [[Transom (architectural)|''transom]] window is often fixed, in an interior door it can open either by hinges at top or bottom, or rotate on hinges. It provided ventilation before forced air heating and cooling. A fan-shaped transom is known as a fanlight, especially in the British Isles.\n\n===Side light===\nWindows beside a door or window are called ''side''-, ''wing''-, and ''margen-lights'' and ''flanking windows''.<ref>Curl, James Stevens. \"Flanking window\".

They are used extensively in tropical architecture. A jalousie door is a door with a jalousie window.\n\n[[File:Paris 12-22 (16249805806).jpg|thumb|[[Clerestory]] windows in the [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] (Paris)]]\n\n===Clerestory===\n{{main|Clerestory}}\nA clerestory window is a window set in a [[roof]] structure or high in a wall, used for [[daylighting]].\n\n===Skylight===\n{{main|Daylighting}}\n[[File:BurlingtonHousePavementWindow.jpg|thumbnail|Sidewalk skylight (also named '[[pavement light]]') outside [[Burlington House]], [[London]]]]\n\nA skylight is a window built into a roof structure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TopgKO4x_2kC&pg=PA223&dq=skylight+is+window+built+into+roof&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigkYOY5rvUAhVK1GMKHSqJBt8Q6AEIMjAD#v=onepage&q=skylight%20is%20window%20built%20into%20roof&f=false|title=Construction Estimating Reference Data|last=Sarviel|first=Ed|date=1993|publisher=Craftsman Book Company|isbn=9780934041843|language=en}}</ref> This type of window allows for natural daylight and moonlight.\n\n===Roof===\n[[File:EdenProjectRoof.jpg|thumbnail|Hexagonal external cladding panels of roof in [[Eden Project]] Biomes ([[Cornwall]], England,)]]\nA sloped window used for [[daylighting]], built into a roof structure.

It projects from the wall and does not extend to the ground. Originally a form of porch, they are often supported by brackets or corbels.\n\n===Thermal===\n{{main|Diocletian window}}\nThermal, or Diocletian, windows are large semicircular windows (or niches) which are usually divided into three lights (window compartments) by two mullions. The central compartment is often wider than the two side lights on either side of it.\n\n===Picture===\nA picture window is a large fixed window in a wall, typically without glazing bars, or glazed with only perfunctory glazing bars ([[muntin]]s) near the edge of the window. Picture windows provide an unimpeded view, as if framing a picture.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/picture+window |title=Picture window |publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Multi-lite===\nA multi-lite window is a window glazed with small panes of glass separated by wooden or lead ''glazing bars'', or ''[[muntins]]'', arranged in a decorative ''glazing pattern'' often dictated by the building's architectural style. Due to the historic unavailability of large panes of glass, the multi-lit (or ''lattice window'') was the most common window style until the beginning of the 20th century, and is still used in traditional architecture.\n\n===Emergency exit/egress===\nAn emergency exit window is a window big enough and low enough so that occupants can escape through the opening in an emergency, such as a [[fire]]. In many countries, exact specifications for emergency windows in bedrooms are given in many [[building codes]]. Specifications for such windows may also allow for the entrance of emergency rescuers. Vehicles, such as [[bus]]es and [[aircraft]], frequently have emergency exit windows as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/documents/outreach/bus/PreTrip-SafetyBrochure-Pull.pdf |title=U.S. Dept. of Transportation: Safety information for bus/motorcoach passengers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Stained glass===\n[[File:Nasir-al molk -1.jpg|thumb|left|Sunlight shining through stained glass, [[Nasir-ol-molk Mosque]], [[Shiraz]], Iran]]\n{{main|stained glass}}\nA stained glass window is a window composed of pieces of colored glass, [[transparency (optics)|transparent, translucent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]], frequently portraying persons or scenes.

French windows are known as ''porte-fen\u00eatre'' in France and ''portafinestra'' in Italy, and frequently are used in modern houses.\n\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Double-paned===\n{{Main|Insulated glazing}}\nDouble-paned windows have two parallel panes (slabs of glass) with a separation of typically about 1&nbsp;cm; this space is permanently sealed and filled at the time of manufacture with dry air or other dry nonreactive gas. Such windows provide a marked improvement in thermal insulation (and usually in acoustic insulation as well) and are resistant to fogging and frosting caused by temperature differential. They are widely used for residential and commercial construction in intemperate climates. Triple-paned windows have been commercially manufactured and marketed with claims of additional benefit but have not become common. In the UK double-paned and triple-paned are referred to as double-glazing and triple-glazing.\n\n===Hexagonal window===\n{{main|hexagonal window}}\n\nA hexagonal window is a hexagon-shaped window, resembling a bee cell or crystal lattice of graphite. The window can be vertically or horizontally oriented, openable or dead. It can also be regular or elongately-shaped and can have a separator ([[mullion]]). Typically, the cellular window is used for an attic or as a decorative feature, but it can also be a major architectural element to provide the natural lighting inside buildings.\n\n==Terms==\nEN 12519 is the European standard that describes windows terms officially used in EU Member States.\nThe main terms are:\n[[File:Casement (PSF).jpg|thumb|Casement window, with [[Latticework|latticed]] lights]]\n* '''Light''', or '''Lite''', is the area between the outer parts of a window ([[Transom (architectural)|transom]], sill and jambs), usually filled with a glass pane.

The terms ''single-light'', ''double-light'', etc., refer to the number of these glass panes in a window.\n* '''Sash unit''' is a window consisting of at least one sliding glass component, typically composed of two lites (known as a ''double-light'').\n* '''Replacement window''' in the United States means a framed window designed to slip inside the original window frame from the inside after the old sashes are removed. In Europe it usually means a complete window including a replacement outer frame.\n* '''New construction window''', in the US, means a window with a nailing fin that is inserted into a rough opening from the outside before applying siding and inside trim. A nailing fin is a projection on the outer frame of the window in the same plane as the [[glazing in architecture|glazing]], which overlaps the prepared opening, and can thus be 'nailed' into place.\n\n:In the UK and mainland Europe, windows in new-build houses are usually fixed with long screws into expanding plastic plugs in the brickwork.  A gap of up to 13 mm is left around all four sides, and filled with expanding [[polyurethane foam]].  This makes the window fixing weatherproof but allows for expansion due to heat.\n* '''[[Lintel]]''' is a beam over the top of a window, also known as a [[transom (architectural)|transom]].\n* '''[[Window sill]]''' is the bottom piece in a window frame. Window sills slant outward to drain water away from the inside of the building.\n* '''Secondary glazing''' is an additional frame applied to the inside of an existing frame, usually used on protected or listed buildings to achieve higher levels of thermal and sound insulation without compromising the look of the building\n* '''[[Millwork (building material)|Decorative millwork]]''' is the moulding, cornices and lintels often decorating the surrounding edges of the window.\n\n===Labeling===\nThe United States [[National Fenestration Rating Council|NFRC]] Window Label lists the following terms:\n* [[Thermal conductivity|Thermal transmittance (U-factor)]], best values are around U-0.15 (equal to 0.8 W/m2/K)\n* [[Solar heat gain coefficient]] (SHGC), ratio of solar heat (infrared) passing through the glass to incident solar heat\n* [[Visible transmittance]] (VT), ratio of transmitted visible light divided by incident visible light\n* [[airflow|Air leakage]] (AL), measured in cubic foot per minute per linear foot of crack between sash and frame\n* [[Damp (structural)#Condensation|Condensation resistance]] (CR), measured between 1 and 100 (the higher the number, the higher the resistance of the formation of condensation)<ref>[http://www.nfrc.org/documents/WindowsandHeatLoss.pdf Windows and Heat Loss], [[NFRC]] Heat Loss Fact Sheet</ref>\n\nThe European harmonised standard hEN 14351-1, which deals with doors and windows, defines 23 characteristics (divided into ''essential'' and ''non ''essential''.

In older windows, large panes of glass were quite expensive, so muntins let smaller panes fill a larger space. In modern windows, light-colored muntins still provide a useful function by reflecting some of the light going through the window, making the window itself a source of diffuse light (instead of just the surfaces and objects illuminated within the room).  By increasing the indirect illumination of surfaces near the window, muntins tend to brighten the area immediately around a window and reduce the contrast of shadows within the room.\n\n===Frame and sash construction===\n\nFrames and sashes can be made of the following materials:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Because PVC is not as strong as other materials, some PVC frames are reinforced with metal or composite materials to improve their structural strength.\n:**Modern aluminium window frames are typically separated by a [[thermal break]] made of a glass fibre reinforced polyamide. With a 34&nbsp;mm thermal insulation profile it is possible to reach Uf= 1.3&nbsp;W/m\u00b2K for a metal window.

Performance of such units depends on good window seals and meticulous frame construction to prevent entry of air and loss of efficiency.\n\nModern double-pane and triple-pane windows often include one or more low-e coatings to reduce the window's U-factor (its insulation value, specifically its rate of heat loss). In general, soft-coat low-e coatings tend to result in a lower solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) than hard-coat low-e coatings.\n\nModern windows are usually glazed with one large sheet of glass per sash, while windows in the past were glazed with multiple panes separated by ''glazing bars'', or ''muntins'', due to the unavailability of large sheets of glass. Today, glazing bars tend to be decorative, separating windows into small panes of glass even though larger panes of glass are available, generally in a pattern dictated by the architectural style at use. Glazing bars are typically wooden, but occasionally lead glazing bars soldered in place are used for more intricate glazing patterns.\n\n===Other construction details===\n\nMany windows have movable [[window covering]]s such as [[blinds]] or [[curtain]]s to keep out light, provide additional insulation, or ensure privacy.\nWindows allow natural light to enter, but too much can have negative effects such as glare and heat gain. Additionally, while windows let the user see outside, there must be a way to maintain privacy on in the inside.<ref name=\"Design Evaluation Project\">Howell, Sandra C. (1976). ''Designing for the Elderly; Windows''. Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Department of Architecture. Design Evaluation Project.</ref> Window coverings are practical accommodations for these issues.\n\n==Impact of the sun==\n{{main|Daylighting}}\n\n===Sun incidence angle===\n\nHistorically, windows are designed with surfaces parallel to vertical building walls.  Such a design allows considerable solar light and heat penetration due to the most commonly occurring incidence of sun angles. In [[passive solar building design]], an extended [[eave]] is typically used to control the amount of solar light and heat entering the window(s).\n\nAn alternative method is to calculate an optimum window mounting angle that accounts for summer sun load minimization, with consideration of actual latitude of the building. This process has been implemented, for example, in the [[Dakin Building]] in [[Brisbane, California]]\u2014in which most of the fenestration is designed to reflect summer heat load and help prevent summer interior [[over-illumination]] and glare, by canting windows to nearly a 45 degree angle.\n\n===Solar window===\n{{Main|Photovoltaics}}\n\nPhotovoltaic windows not only provide a clear view and illuminate rooms, but also convert sunlight to electricity for the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.mit.edu/2008/mit-opens-new-window-solar-energy/|title=MIT opens new 'window' on solar energy |publisher=Web.mit.edu |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref> In most cases, translucent photovoltaic cells are used.\n\n===Passive solar===\n\nPassive solar windows allow light and solar energy into a building while minimizing air leakage and heat loss. Properly positioning these windows in relation to sun, wind, and landscape\u2014while properly shading them to limit excess heat gain in summer and shoulder seasons, and providing thermal mass to absorb energy during the day and release it when temperatures cool at night\u2014increases comfort and energy efficiency. Properly designed in climates with adequate solar gain, these can even be a building's primary heating system.\n\n===Coverings===\n\nA [[window covering]] is a shade or screen that provides multiple functions. Some coverings, such as drapes and blinds provide occupants with privacy. Some window coverings control solar heat gain and glare. There are external shading devices and internal shading devices.<ref name=\"Windows\">Beckett, H. E., & Godfrey, J. A. (1974). ''Windows: Performance, design and installation''.

One of the mausoleums outside the town contains the tomb of Sheikh [[Saadi Shirazi|Sa'di]], the first poet of his time. Close at hand is a hermitage built by Sa'di himself, surrounded by a charming garden. It is situated near the source of the Ruknabad. In the garden Sheikh Sa'di constructed a number of basins for the washing of clothes. The citizens of Shiraz make parties of pleasure to this mausoleum; they eat food prepared in the hermitage, wash their garments in the river, and at sunset return to the town. So did I also. May God have mercy on Shiraz!\"\n\n==Edward Granville Browne==\n[[Edward Granville Browne]], later to become author of the well-known ''A Literary History of Persia'', visited Shiraz as a young man in March 1888, and recorded his impressions of the Roknabad stream as he approached the city from the north as follows:<ref>Browne, E. G. (1893/1926) ''A Year Amongst the Persians'' (Cambridge), p. 282.</ref>\n\n:\"Beyond this there was little to attract my interest till, about 1.30, on surmounting another pass, \u1e24\u00e1j\u00ed \u1e62afar cried out \"''Rukn\u00e1b\u00e1d! Rukn\u00e1b\u00e1d!''&thinsp;\" and, with a thrill of pleasure, I found myself at the source of that stream, so dear to every Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed, of which \u1e24\u00e1fi\u1e93 declared, in perhaps the best known of his poems, that Paradise itself could not boast the like. \n\n:\"But for the rich associations which the sight of it evoked in my mind, I might perhaps have experienced that sense of disappointment with which [[\u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry|V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry]] declares he was affected by the first view of this classic stream. As it was, I saw nothing but the limpid water rushing from its rocky source; heard nothing but its melodious ripple; thought nothing but those thoughts which rise in the mind of one who first stands in the favourite haunt of an immortal bard who immortalises all that he touches.\"\n\n==Herman Bicknell==\nThe linguist and traveller Herman Bicknell, who spent several months in Shiraz in 1869, writes: \"The ruined mosque of Musall\u00e1, and the brook of Rukn\u00e1b\u00e1d about four feet wide, are a mile to the North of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z. The water of this streamlet, derived from a spring in the pass of All\u00e2hu Akbar, has been made to branch into two principal channels, one South-eastward, the other South-westward, to irrigate various sown fields and gardens, among the latter the H\u00e1fiz\u00edah, part of which is a cemetery, and contains the poet's tomb. By the \"bloomy ways of Mosall\u00e1,\" H\u00e1fiz means the corn-fields, bright in spring with corn-flowers, poppies, and the grape-hyacinth; perhaps also the alleys in the neighbouring gardens.\"<ref>Bicknell, Herman (1875).

One of the mausoleums outside the town contains the tomb of Sheikh [[Saadi Shirazi|Sa'di]], the first poet of his time. Close at hand is a hermitage built by Sa'di himself, surrounded by a charming garden. It is situated near the source of the Ruknabad. In the garden Sheikh Sa'di constructed a number of basins for the washing of clothes. The citizens of Shiraz make parties of pleasure to this mausoleum; they eat food prepared in the hermitage, wash their garments in the river, and at sunset return to the town. So did I also. May God have mercy on Shiraz!\"\n\n==Edward Granville Browne==\n[[Edward Granville Browne]], later to become author of the well-known ''A Literary History of Persia'', visited Shiraz as a young man in March 1888, and recorded his impressions of the Roknabad stream as he approached the city from the north as follows:<ref>Browne, E. G. (1893/1926) ''A Year Amongst the Persians'' (Cambridge), p. 282.</ref>\n\n:\"Beyond this there was little to attract my interest till, about 1.30, on surmounting another pass, \u1e24\u00e1j\u00ed \u1e62afar cried out \"''Rukn\u00e1b\u00e1d! Rukn\u00e1b\u00e1d!''&thinsp;\" and, with a thrill of pleasure, I found myself at the source of that stream, so dear to every Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed, of which \u1e24\u00e1fi\u1e93 declared, in perhaps the best known of his poems, that Paradise itself could not boast the like. \n\n:\"But for the rich associations which the sight of it evoked in my mind, I might perhaps have experienced that sense of disappointment with which [[\u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry|V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry]] declares he was affected by the first view of this classic stream. As it was, I saw nothing but the limpid water rushing from its rocky source; heard nothing but its melodious ripple; thought nothing but those thoughts which rise in the mind of one who first stands in the favourite haunt of an immortal bard who immortalises all that he touches.\"\n\n==Herman Bicknell==\nThe linguist and traveller Herman Bicknell, who spent several months in Shiraz in 1869, writes: \"The ruined mosque of Musall\u00e1, and the brook of Rukn\u00e1b\u00e1d about four feet wide, are a mile to the North of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z. The water of this streamlet, derived from a spring in the pass of All\u00e2hu Akbar, has been made to branch into two principal channels, one South-eastward, the other South-westward, to irrigate various sown fields and gardens, among the latter the H\u00e1fiz\u00edah, part of which is a cemetery, and contains the poet's tomb. By the \"bloomy ways of Mosall\u00e1,\" H\u00e1fiz means the corn-fields, bright in spring with corn-flowers, poppies, and the grape-hyacinth; perhaps also the alleys in the neighbouring gardens.\"<ref>Bicknell, Herman (1875).

{"title_page": "Instinct", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n'''Instinct''' or '''innate behavior''' is the inherent inclination of a [[life|living]] [[organism]] towards a particular complex [[behavior]]. The simplest example of an instinctive behavior is a [[fixed action pattern]] (FAP), in which a very short to medium length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a corresponding clearly defined stimulus. [[File:BabyLoggerheadTlalcoyunque3.jpg|thumb|220px|A baby [[leatherback turtle]] makes its way to the open ocean.]]\nAny behavior is instinctive if it is performed without being based upon prior experience (that is, in the absence of [[learning]]), and is therefore an expression of innate biological factors.  [[Sea turtle]]s, newly hatched on a beach, will automatically move toward the ocean.  A [[marsupial]] climbs into its mother's pouch upon being born. [[Honeybee]]s communicate by dancing in the direction of a food source without formal instruction. Other examples include animal fighting, animal [[courtship]] behavior, internal escape functions, and the building of [[nest]]s. Though an instinct is defined by its invariant innate characteristics, details of its performance can be changed by experience; for example, a dog can improve its fighting skills by practice.[[File:Instinct dog shake.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An instinctive behavior of shaking water from wet fur]]\n\nInstincts are inborn complex patterns of behavior that exist in most members of the species, and should be distinguished from [[reflex]]es, which are simple responses of an organism to a specific stimulus, such as the contraction of the pupil in response to bright light or the spasmodic movement of the lower leg when the knee is tapped. The absence of volitional capacity must not be confused with an inability to modify fixed action patterns. For example, people may be able to modify a stimulated fixed action pattern by consciously recognizing the point of its activation and simply stop doing it, whereas animals without a sufficiently strong volitional capacity may not be able to disengage from their fixed action patterns, once activated.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lorenz |first=Konrad |title=Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge |year=1977 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=New York |isbn=978-0-15-111699-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/behindmirror00konr }}</ref>\n\nInstinctual behaviour in humans has been studied, and is a controversial topic.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Greifreflex.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Primitive reflex]]es]]\n\n===In animal biology===\n[[Jean Henri Fabre]] (1823-1915), an [[entomologist]], considered instinct to be any behavior which did not require [[cognition]] or [[consciousness]] to perform. Fabre's inspiration was his intense study of insects, some of whose behaviors he wrongly considered fixed and not subject to environmental influence.<ref>{{cite book |title=Insectopedia |first=Hugh |last=Raffles |publisher=Pantheon Books |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-375-42386-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedinsec00raff }}</ref>\n\nInstinct as a concept fell out of favor in the 1920s with the rise of [[behaviorism]] and such thinkers as [[B. F. Skinner]], which held that most significant behavior is learned.\n\nAn interest in innate behaviors arose again in the 1950s with [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], who made the distinction between instinct and learned behaviors.  Our modern understanding of instinctual behavior in animals owes much to their work.  For instance, there exists a sensitive period for a bird in which it learns the identity of its mother. Konrad Lorenz famously had a goose [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] on his boots. Thereafter the goose would follow whoever wore the boots. This suggests that the identity of the goose's mother was learned, but the goose's behavior towards what it perceived as its mother was instinctive.\n\n===In psychology===\nThe term \"instinct\" in [[psychology]] was first used in the 1870s by [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. By the close of the 19th century, most repeated behavior was considered instinctual.  In a survey of the literature at that time, one researcher{{who|date=January 2019}} chronicled 4,000 human \"instincts,\" having applied this label to any behavior that was repetitive.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In the early twentieth century, there was recognized a \"union of instinct and emotion\".<ref>James Rowland Angell, J.R.

(1928). ''An Introduction to Social Psychology'', 21st edition, Methuen & Co. Ltd, London, p. vii.</ref> As research became more rigorous and terms better defined, instinct as an explanation for human behavior became less common. In 1932, McDougall argued that the word 'instinct' is more suitable for describing animal behaviour, while he recommended the word '[[wiktionary:propensity|propensity]]' for goal directed combinations of the many innate human abilities, which are loosely and variably linked, in a way that shows strong [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]].<ref>McDougall, W.

By the year 2000, a survey of the 12 best selling textbooks in Introductory Psychology revealed only one reference to instincts, and that was in regard to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s referral to the \"[[Id, ego, and super-ego#Id|id]]\" instincts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In this sense, the term 'instinct' appeared to have become outmoded for introductory textbooks on human psychology.\n\nSigmund Freud considered that mental images of bodily needs, expressed in the form of [[desire]]s, are called instincts.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hjelle |first=Larry| last2=Ziegler |first2=Daniel  |date= 1981 |title= Personality Theories: Basic Assumptions, Research, and Applications|url= |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=494 |isbn= 9780070290631 |author-link= }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, the psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] argued that humans no longer have instincts because we have the ability to override them in certain situations. He felt that what is called instinct is often imprecisely defined, and really amounts to strong ''drives''. For Maslow, an instinct is something which cannot be overridden, and therefore while the term may have applied to humans in the past, it no longer does.<ref>{{cite book |first=Abraham H. |last=Maslow |title=Motivation and Personality |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/motivationperson00masl_0 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter=Instinct Theory Reexamined |location=New York |publisher=Harper & Row |year=1954 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\nThe book ''Instinct: an enduring problem in psychology'' (1961)<ref>Birney, R.C., Teevan, R.C.

Mandal proposed a set of criteria by which a behavior might be considered instinctual:  a) be automatic, b) be irresistible, c) occur at some point in development, d) be triggered by some event in the environment, e) occur in every member of the species, f) be unmodifiable, and g) govern behavior for which the organism needs no training (although the organism may profit from experience and to that degree the behavior is modifiable).<ref>{{cite book|title=Textbook of Animal Behaviour|last=Mandal|first=F.

The stimulus in a reflex may not require brain activity but instead may travel to the spinal cord as a message that is then transmitted back through the body, tracing a path called the [[reflex arc]]. Reflexes are similar to [[fixed action pattern]]s in that most reflexes meet the criteria of a FAP.  However, a fixed action pattern can be processed in the brain as well; a male [[stickleback]]'s instinctive aggression towards anything red during his mating season is such an example.  Examples of instinctive behaviors in humans include many of the [[primitive reflexes]], such as rooting and suckling, behaviors which are present in [[mammal]]s. In rats, it has been observed that innate responses are related to specific chemicals, and these chemicals are detected by two organs located in the nose: the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the main olfactory epithelium (MOE).<ref name=\"Sokolowski & Corbin 2012\">{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fnmol.2012.00055 |pmid=22557946 |pmc=3337482 |title=Wired for behaviors: From development to function of innate limbic system circuitry |journal=Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience |volume=5 |pages=55 |year=2012 |last1=Sokolowski |first1=Katie |last2=Corbin |first2=Joshua G. }}</ref>\n\n==Maturational==\n\nSome instinctive behaviors depend on maturational processes to appear.

The choice between the two can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on what the partner-organism chooses. Though this psychological example of game theory does not have such directly measurable results, it provides an interesting theory of unique thought. From a more biological standpoint, the brain's [[limbic system]] operates as the main control-area for response to certain stimuli, including a variety of instinctual behavior. The limbic system processes external stimuli related to emotions, social activity, and motivation, which propagates a behavioral response. Some behaviors include maternal care, aggression, defense, and social hierarchy.  These behaviors are influenced by sensory input \u2014 sight, sound, touch, and smell.\n\nWithin the circuitry of the limbic system, there are various places where evolution could have taken place, or could take place in the future. For example, many rodents have receptors in the [[vomeronasal organ]] that respond explicitly to predator stimuli that specifically relate to that individual species of rodent. The reception of a predatory stimulus usually creates a response of defense or fear.<ref name=\"Sokolowski & Corbin 2012\"/> Mating in rats follows a similar mechanism. The vomeronasal organ and the main olfactory epithelium, together called the [[olfactory system]], detect pheromones from the opposite sex. These signals then travel  to the medial amygdala, which disperses the signal to a variety of brain parts. The pathways involved with innate circuitry are extremely specialized and specific.<ref name=\"Sokolowski & Corbin 2012\"/>  Various organs and sensory receptors play parts in this complex process.\n\nInstinct is a phenomenon that can be investigated from a multitude of angles: genetics, limbic system, nervous pathways, and environment. Researchers can study levels of instincts, from molecular to groups of individuals. Extremely specialized systems have evolved, resulting in individuals which exhibit behaviors without learning them.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Drive theory]]\n* [[Ethology]]\n* [[Genetic memory (psychology)|Genetic memory]]\n*[[Heuristic]]\n* [[Human ethology]]\n* [[Innatism]]\n* [[Nature versus nurture]]\n* [[Prey drive]] (hunting instinct)\n* [[Psychological nativism]]\n*[[Rationality]]\n* [[Sociobiology]]\n* [[Unconscious mind]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{cite book|first1=Jean|last1=Laplanche|first2=Jean-Bertrand|last2=Pontalis|authorlink1=Jean Laplanche|authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis|title=The Language of Psycho-analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC|publisher=Karnac Books|location=London|year=1973|chapter=Instinct (or Drive) (pp. 214-7)|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&pg=PA214|isbn=978-0-946-43949-2}}\n\n{{Neuroethology}}\n{{ethology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ethology]]\n[[Category:Neuroethology concepts]]\n[[Category:Animal cognition]]\n[[Category:Unconscious]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n'''Instinct''' or '''innate behavior''' is the inherent inclination of a [[life|living]] [[organism]] towards a particular complex [[behavior]]. The simplest example of an instinctive behavior is a [[fixed action pattern]] (FAP), in which a very short to medium length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a corresponding clearly defined stimulus. [[File:BabyLoggerheadTlalcoyunque3.jpg|thumb|220px|A baby [[leatherback turtle]] makes its way to the open ocean.]]\nAny behavior is instinctive if it is performed without being based upon prior experience (that is, in the absence of [[learning]]), and is therefore an expression of innate biological factors.  [[Sea turtle]]s, newly hatched on a beach, will automatically move toward the ocean.  A [[marsupial]] climbs into its mother's pouch upon being born. [[Honeybee]]s communicate by dancing in the direction of a food source without formal instruction. Other examples include animal fighting, animal [[courtship]] behavior, internal escape functions, and the building of [[nest]]s. Though an instinct is defined by its invariant innate characteristics, details of its performance can be changed by experience; for example, a dog can improve its fighting skills by practice.[[File:Instinct dog shake.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An instinctive behavior of shaking water from wet fur]]\n\nInstincts are inborn complex patterns of behavior that exist in most members of the species, and should be distinguished from [[reflex]]es, which are simple responses of an organism to a specific stimulus, such as the contraction of the pupil in response to bright light or the spasmodic movement of the lower leg when the knee is tapped. The absence of volitional capacity must not be confused with an inability to modify fixed action patterns. For example, people may be able to modify a stimulated fixed action pattern by consciously recognizing the point of its activation and simply stop doing it, whereas animals without a sufficiently strong volitional capacity may not be able to disengage from their fixed action patterns, once activated.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lorenz |first=Konrad |title=Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge |year=1977 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=New York |isbn=978-0-15-111699-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/behindmirror00konr }}</ref>\n\nInstinctual behaviour in humans has been studied, and is a controversial topic.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Greifreflex.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Primitive reflex]]es]]\n\n===In animal biology===\n[[Jean Henri Fabre]] (1823-1915), an [[entomologist]], considered instinct to be any behavior which did not require [[cognition]] or [[consciousness]] to perform.

F. Skinner]], which held that most significant behavior is learned.\n\nAn interest in innate behaviors arose again in the 1950s with [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], who made the distinction between instinct and learned behaviors.  Our modern understanding of instinctual behavior in animals owes much to their work.  For instance, there exists a sensitive period for a bird in which it learns the identity of its mother. Konrad Lorenz famously had a goose [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] on his boots. Thereafter the goose would follow whoever wore the boots. This suggests that the identity of the goose's mother was learned, but the goose's behavior towards what it perceived as its mother was instinctive.\n\n===In psychology===\nThe term \"instinct\" in [[psychology]] was first used in the 1870s by [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. By the close of the 19th century, most repeated behavior was considered instinctual.  In a survey of the literature at that time, one researcher{{who|date=January 2019}} chronicled 4,000 human \"instincts,\" having applied this label to any behavior that was repetitive.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In the early twentieth century, there was recognized a \"union of instinct and emotion\".<ref>James Rowland Angell, J.R.

In 1932, McDougall argued that the word 'instinct' is more suitable for describing animal behaviour, while he recommended the word '[[wiktionary:propensity|propensity]]' for goal directed combinations of the many innate human abilities, which are loosely and variably linked, in a way that shows strong [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]].<ref>McDougall, W.

The stimulus in a reflex may not require brain activity but instead may travel to the spinal cord as a message that is then transmitted back through the body, tracing a path called the [[reflex arc]]. Reflexes are similar to [[fixed action pattern]]s in that most reflexes meet the criteria of a FAP.  However, a fixed action pattern can be processed in the brain as well; a male [[stickleback]]'s instinctive aggression towards anything red during his mating season is such an example.  Examples of instinctive behaviors in humans include many of the [[primitive reflexes]], such as rooting and suckling, behaviors which are present in [[mammal]]s.

Some behaviors include maternal care, aggression, defense, and social hierarchy.  These behaviors are influenced by sensory input \u2014 sight, sound, touch, and smell.\n\nWithin the circuitry of the limbic system, there are various places where evolution could have taken place, or could take place in the future. For example, many rodents have receptors in the [[vomeronasal organ]] that respond explicitly to predator stimuli that specifically relate to that individual species of rodent. The reception of a predatory stimulus usually creates a response of defense or fear.<ref name=\"Sokolowski & Corbin 2012\"/> Mating in rats follows a similar mechanism. The vomeronasal organ and the main olfactory epithelium, together called the [[olfactory system]], detect pheromones from the opposite sex. These signals then travel  to the medial amygdala, which disperses the signal to a variety of brain parts. The pathways involved with innate circuitry are extremely specialized and specific.<ref name=\"Sokolowski & Corbin 2012\"/>  Various organs and sensory receptors play parts in this complex process.\n\nInstinct is a phenomenon that can be investigated from a multitude of angles: genetics, limbic system, nervous pathways, and environment. Researchers can study levels of instincts, from molecular to groups of individuals. Extremely specialized systems have evolved, resulting in individuals which exhibit behaviors without learning them.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Drive theory]]\n* [[Ethology]]\n* [[Genetic memory (psychology)|Genetic memory]]\n*[[Heuristic]]\n* [[Human ethology]]\n* [[Innatism]]\n* [[Nature versus nurture]]\n* [[Prey drive]] (hunting instinct)\n* [[Psychological nativism]]\n*[[Rationality]]\n* [[Sociobiology]]\n* [[Unconscious mind]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{cite book|first1=Jean|last1=Laplanche|first2=Jean-Bertrand|last2=Pontalis|authorlink1=Jean Laplanche|authorlink2=Jean-Bertrand Pontalis|title=The Language of Psycho-analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC|publisher=Karnac Books|location=London|year=1973|chapter=Instinct (or Drive) (pp. 214-7)|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&pg=PA214|isbn=978-0-946-43949-2}}\n\n{{Neuroethology}}\n{{ethology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ethology]]\n[[Category:Neuroethology concepts]]\n[[Category:Animal cognition]]\n[[Category:Unconscious]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: In 1950s \u2192 In the 1950s, ]]\u2019s \u2192 ]]'s", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instinct"}
