Vincent Vattoli ([[Indrajith Sukumaran|Indrajith]]) comes to the church as a new recruit to the parish. He learns about the relationship and tries to unite the couple. At this time, the marriage of Shoshanna gets fixed. Solomon attempts to elope, in vain. They are caught by Shoshana's parents and Solomon is mercilessly beaten up. The people of Kumanamkari and the neighboring town then place a bet in which the St. George's band has to win in order for Solomon's marriage to occur. It was said that Shoshanna would be married to Solomon if they win the competition with Solomon leading the band. The band takes intense practices and wins the bet. Solomon marries Shoshanna while Solomon's band master dies. At that night Shosana's father backs out of the bet. Him, the evil old parish priest and Solomons uncle are haunted at night by St. George at the time when they were destroying the church. They all came to the realisation that Solomon had divine powers on his side and they stood aside from Solomon's life as obstacles.

Vincent Vattoli ([[Indrajith Sukumaran|Indrajith]]) comes to the church as a new recruit to the parish. He learns about the relationship and tries to unite the couple. At this time, the marriage of Shoshanna gets fixed. Solomon attempts to elope, in vain. They are caught by Shoshana's parents and Solomon is mercilessly beaten up. The people of Kumanamkari and the neighboring town then place a bet in which the St. George's band has to win in order for Solomon's marriage to occur. It was said that Shoshanna would be married to Solomon if they win the competition with Solomon leading the band. The band takes intense practices and wins the bet. Solomon gets married to Shoshanna while Solomon's band master dies. At that night Shosana's father backs out of the bet. Him, the evil old parish priest and Solomons uncle are haunted at night by St. George at the time when they were destroying the church. They all came to the realisation that Solomon had divine powers on his side and they stood aside from Solomon's life as obstacles.  The next day a call comes to the church informing that the new Priest Fr. Vincent Vattoli is taking charge. The Kumarangiri folks now come to know that Fr. Vincent Vattoli was actually the saint himself who appeared in front of them.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Fahadh Faasil]] as Solomon\n* [[Indrajith Sukumaran|Indrajith]] as Father Vincent Vattolli/Saint\n* [[Swathi Reddy]] as Shoshanna\n* [[Kalabhavan Mani]] as Louis Pappan\n*Nisha Sarang\n* [[Rachana Narayanankutty]] as Clarata\n* Natasha Sahgal as Michelle\n* [[Joy Mathew]] as Father Abraham Ottaplakan\n* [[Nandhu]] as Philipose\n* [[Sandra Thomas]] as Mariyama\n* [[Anil Murali]] as Davis\n* [[Makarand Deshpande]] as Shevaliyar Pothachan\n* [[Sasi Kalinga]] as Chachappan\n* [[Sunil Sukhada]] as Kappiyar Kochousep\n* Jayasanker Karimuttam  as Vishakol Pappy\n* [[Rajesh Hebbar]] as Esthappan/Esthappanasan\n* [[Chemban Vinod Jose]] as Paily\n* Kainakary Thankaraj as Chali Pappan\n*[[Sudheer Karamana]]   as Mathayichan\n* [[Sudhi Koppa]] as Sebastian (Clara's lover)\n* [[Chali Pala]] as Mathews\n* [[Kulappulli Leela]] as Therutha\n\n==Production==\nThe film is scripted by PS Rafeeque, who also wrote Lijo's debut feature film ''[[Nayakan (2010 film)|Nayakan]]'' (2010).

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|last=|first=|date=|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180906/https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|archive-date=2019-12-19|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, the ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' was incorporated after obtaining a franchise to operate a streetcar service from the Town of Cornwall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive and four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, two additional cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.

{"title_page": "Private limited company", "text_new": "{{Companies law}}\n\nA '''private limited company''' is a [[type of business entity]] in [[Privately held company|\"private\" ownership]] used in many jurisdictions, in contrast to [[Public company|\"public\" ownership]], with some differences from country to country. Private limited companies have a limited number of employees which normally is 50. Examples include ''[[limited liability company|LLC]]'' in the [[US]], ''[[private company limited by shares]]'' in the [[UK]], ''[[GmbH]]'' in [[Germany]] or ''[[spole\u010dnost s ru\u010den\u00edm omezen\u00fdm]]'' in the [[Czech Republic]].The benefit of having a private limited company is that there is limited liabilities and depending on each one\u2019s point of view this next point could either be a benefit or a disadvantage. Shares can only be sold to shareholders in the business that means that it can be difficult to liquidate them. \n\n{{horizontal TOC|nonum=yes}}\n\n== Abbreviations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Partners' contributions constitute the registered capital of a limited liability company. Each partner has his quota in the company in proportion to the contribution of the capital so the registered capital of the company is divided between the partners based on the proportional ratio of their contribution. In Albania a limited liability company may not have a capital of less than 100 [[Albanian lek|lek]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acitad.org/format-ligjore-te-shoqerive|title=Format ligjore t\u00eb shoq\u00ebrive - Acitad|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Argentina==\nAlthough not an exact equivalent, the Argentine variant of the LLC is called ''Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S.R.L.)'' and it limits the liability of its members up to their capital contribution in the company. The equity is divided into equal stakes (can not be called \"shares\"), each one of which represents a percentage of the company and that can not be traded on the stock exchange. Their by-laws are regulated by law N\u00b0 19550<ref>Ley de Sociedades Comerciales (Spanish) http://www.cnv.gov.ar/LeyesYReg/Leyes/19550.htm</ref> and the commercial partnership is limited to a maximum of 50 partners.\n\n== Bolivia ==\nIn Bolivia, the LLC variant is called Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada (S.R.L.). These companies' legal framework consist in the [[Law of Bolivia|Trade Code]] (Decree Law N\u00b0 14379 of February 25th, 1977), it's modifications and other supplementary laws. The members participate in it through capital stakes, and their liability is limited to the value of their contributions. The number of members must be minimum 2 and maximum 25. \n\n==Bosnia and Herzegovina==\nBosnian and Herzegovinian legislation, similarly to that in Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia contemplates LLCs as ''dru\u0161tvo s ograni\u010denom odgovorno\u0161\u0107u'' (d.o.o.). Companies using this structure append the abbreviation d.o.o. to their company name.

Also (LLC) These companies are regulated by law N\u00b0 3.918. Among their most important characteristics we can say that:\n* They can pursue a commercial or non-commercial purpose (Sociedad Comercial de Responsabilidad Limitada / Sociedad Civil de Responsabilidad Limitada).\n* They must be formed by two or more partners and can hold up to a maximum of fifty.\n* Their equity is divided into \"cuotas\" (not shares) each one of which represents a percentage of the company.\n* They can be managed by one or more managers (external if need be), or by a board of directors.\n* Their by-laws can't be modified, nor their partners be changed, without the consent of all the other partners.\n* In tax considerations, they differ from the LLC's because they pay a corporate tax for their income, amount that can be deducted by their owners as a credit against the taxes they pay.\n\nChilean law also contemplates a very special kind of individual owner LLC called ''Empresa Individual de Responsabilidad Limitada'' (Limited Liability Individual Company), which uses the E.I.R.L. aggregation.\n\n==Colombia==\nColombian legislation contemplates a very similar structure as mentioned above in the Chilean case. The ''Ltda.'' abbreviation is also used in Colombia.<ref>C\u00f3digo de Comercio de Colombia, just like S.A..</ref>\n\n==Croatia==\nIn Croatia, a private limited liability company is termed ''dru\u0161tvo s ograni\u010denom odgovorno\u0161\u0107u'' (literal: limited liability company), abbreviated ''d.o.o.''.

An ''s.r.o.'' is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation. Czech law does not offer a possibility to start up a limited company without the possibility of avoiding double taxation. As of 2014 the liability is not limited in Czech, since managing director (''jednatel'', mandatory board member in Czech LLCs) bears full liability that extends to all of his/her property, including private one.\n\n==Denmark==\nThe Danish form of the LLC is the ''[[kommanditselskab]]'' (K/S). There is no minimum capital requirements. In a K/S there are two types of shareholders, the ''komplementar'' which is fully liable, and the ''kommanditist'' which liability is limited. The K/S is a tax-transparent company, which means the income \"passes through\" the company directly to the shareholders.\n\n==Dominican Republic==\nDominican Republic legislation contemplates LLCs as ''Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada'', also known by their abbreviation ''S.R.L.;; S.R.L.s award limited liability to their members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital).

On one hand it is possible to consider it as a kind of ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung]]'' (GmbH) because it has aspects of a [[corporation]]; on the other hand it could be considered to be a kind of ''[[Kommanditgesellschaft]]'' (KG), which is the German equivalent of a [[limited partnership]]. Based on the literal translation of the word \"company\", an LLC should be considered to be a kind of KG without any liable partner. The German equivalent that comes closest to LLC, is [[GmbH & Co KG]], a nested  [[Kommanditgesellschaft]] (KG) where a [[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung]] (GmbH) takes the role of the fully liable partner.

The death, insanity, incapacity or insolvency of its shareholder or directors does not affect the existence of the Private Limited Company in any way\n* '''limited liability ''' Since the private limited company is the Separate Legal Entity. Thus the liability of the members, shareholders, and Directors is limited to the amount of share they hold in the Company. They are not accountable for the debt of the company their liability is limited to their unpaid amount of shares in the company.\n* '''Tax Advantage''' As everyone wants to minimize his tax burden thus company as per the income tax act 1961 has another main benefit of incorporation towards taxation. Private Limited Companies enjoy tax advantages added on to the limited liability wherein the companies pay corporation tax on their taxable profit and tend to get excused from higher personal income tax rates. Instead of being a sole trader forming a company leads to an increase in tax deduction and allowances redeemable against profits.\n* '''Dual Relationship'''  In Private Limited company it is possible for a company to make a valid and effective contract with any of its members or Shareholders or employees. It is also possible for a person to be in control of a company and at the same time be in its employment. Thus, a person can at the same time be a shareholder, creditor, director, and also an employee of that Private limited company.\n* '''Easy transferability of shares''' Shares of a Private Limited company limited by shares are transferable by a shareholder to any other person. The transfer is easy as compared to the transfer of an interest in a business run as a proprietary concern or a partnership. Filing and signing a share transfer form and handing over the buyer of the shares along with a share certificate can easily transfer shares from one person to another.\n* '''perpetual Succession''' The Private limited company is the separate Juridical Person in the law. Thus the Continuation of the company does not come to an end even after the death or incapacity of all the members and it continues to function.\n\n==Iran==\nAs of 2015, there are seven types of companies which can be registered under Iran's company registration law. One of these seven types of companies and partnerships refers to LLPs. Like many other countries, two persons are required to form an LLP in Iran.

The minimum capital required by law in a private company, ''privat aktiebolag'', is SEK 50,000, although this may be in the form of assets as well as capital. The AB structure requires shareholders, a Board of Directors, and regular meetings of both, together with complete accounts once per year.

Legal entities (foreign or Ukrainian companies) individuals, regardless of their country of citizenship or residency can be the founders (participants) of LLC. Limited liability company can be formed either by one person or by several individuals or legal entities (corporations). Maximum number of participants (founders) of LLC in Ukraine is 100.

In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 50 shareholders whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum share capital (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the company\u2019s share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line.

Should one member of an LLC be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen, any case between the LLC and those parties must be heard in that state's courts; corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in which the corporation is incorporated (most commonly [[Delaware General Corporation Law|Delaware]] for large corporations, which has a small population) or has its principal place of business.\n\n[[AOL]] was set up as an LLC during its ownership by [[Time Warner]] from 2001 to 2008.

Partners' contributions constitute the registered capital of a limited liability company.

Also (LLC) These companies are regulated by law N\u00b0 3.918. Among their most important characteristics we can say that:\n* They can pursue a commercial or non-commercial purpose (Sociedad Comercial de Responsabilidad Limitada / Sociedad Civil de Responsabilidad Limitada).\n* They must be formed by two or more partners and can hold up to a maximum of fifty.\n* Their equity is divided into \"cuotas\" (not shares) each one of which represents a percentage of the company.\n* They can be managed by one or more managers (external if need be), or by a board of directors.\n* Their by-laws can't be modified, nor their partners be changed, without the consent of all the other partners.\n* In tax considerations, they differ from the LLC's because they pay a corporate tax for their income, amount that can be deducted by their owners as a credit against the taxes they pay.\n\nChilean law also contemplates a very special kind of individual owner LLC called ''Empresa Individual de Responsabilidad Limitada'' (Limited Liability Individual Company), which uses the E.I.R.L. aggregation.\n\n==Colombia==\nColombian legislation contemplates a very similar structure as mentioned above in the Chilean case. The ''Ltda.'' abbreviation is also used in Colombia.<ref>C\u00f3digo de Comercio de Colombia, just like S.A..</ref>\n\n==Croatia==\nIn Croatia, a private limited liability company is termed ''dru\u0161tvo s ograni\u010denom odgovorno\u0161\u0107u'' (literal: limited liability company), abbreviated ''d.o.o.''. A public limited liability company is termed a ''dioni\u010dko dru\u0161tvo'' (literal: joint stock company) abbreviated ''d.d.''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/pdf/croatia/screening_reports/screening_report_06_hr_internet_en.pdf| title=Screening report : Croatia| at=Chapter 6 \u2013 Company Law, section IIa. Company law, p.3| date=18 December 2006| publisher=ec.europa.eu}}</ref>\n\n==Czech Republic==\nCzech legislation contemplates LLCs as ''[[spole\u010dnost s ru\u010den\u00edm omezen\u00fdm]]'' (''s.r.o.'' or ''spol. s r.o.''). An ''s.r.o.'' is not technically comparable to an LLC because the profits are still subject to double taxation. Czech law does not offer a possibility to start up a limited company without the possibility of avoiding double taxation. As of 2014 the liability is not limited in Czech, since managing director (''jednatel'', mandatory board member in Czech LLCs) bears full liability that extends to all of his/her property, including private one.\n\n==Denmark==\nThe Danish form of the LLC is the ''[[kommanditselskab]]'' (K/S). There is no minimum capital requirements. In a K/S there are two types of shareholders, the ''komplementar'' which is fully liable, and the ''kommanditist'' which liability is limited. The K/S is a tax-transparent company, which means the income \"passes through\" the company directly to the shareholders.\n\n==Dominican Republic==\nDominican Republic legislation contemplates LLCs as ''Sociedad de Responsabilidad Limitada'', also known by their abbreviation ''S.R.L.;; S.R.L.s award limited liability to their members up to their contribution in the company (i.e., contribution of capital). This type of company began after the law number 479 of the year 2008.\n\n==Estonia==\nThe Estonian version of private limited company (limited liability company) is called ''osa\u00fching'' (O\u00dc). The type of entity is also required to be identified in the name.\nAn O\u00dc is taxed as a corporation. The minimum capital required by law is \u20ac2,500.<ref>{{cite web |title=Commercial Code (\u00a7 9, \u00a7 135-136) |url=https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/Riigikogu/act/501042019010/consolide |accessdate= 12 October 2019 |publisher=Riigi Teataja}}</ref>\n\n==Finland==\nAlthough not an exact equivalent, the Finnish version of the LLC is the Oy (osakeyhti\u00f6) or in Swedish Ab (aktiebolag). An Oy is taxed as a corporation. Since the 1st of july 2019, there is no minimum capital required by law.\n\n==Germany==\nBecause of its hybrid characteristics it is very difficult to determine the German equivalent. On one hand it is possible to consider it as a kind of ''[[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung]]'' (GmbH) because it has aspects of a [[corporation]]; on the other hand it could be considered to be a kind of ''[[Kommanditgesellschaft]]'' (KG), which is the German equivalent of a [[limited partnership]]. Based on the literal translation of the word \"company\", an LLC should be considered to be a kind of KG without any liable partner. The German equivalent that comes closest to LLC, is [[GmbH & Co KG]], a nested  [[Kommanditgesellschaft]] (KG) where a [[Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung]] (GmbH) takes the role of the fully liable partner. For the purpose of taxation, the [[Bundesfinanzministerium]] (German Federal Ministry of Finance) gives detailed guidelines of the circumstances under which an LLC is to be considered to be a \"corporation\" or as a \"limited partnership\".<ref>[https://usainc.de/index.php/download_file/74/147/ ''Steuerliche Einordnung der nach dem Recht der Bundesstaaten der USA gegr\u00fcndeten Limited Liability Company''].</ref> It is useful to note, however, that the original LLC statutes of Wyoming and other US states were more or less explicitly modeled after the GmbH.<ref name=\"LLC Reporter\">{{cite web |url=http://www.llc-reporter.com/16.htm |title=Historical Background of the Limited Liability Company |publisher=Llc-reporter.com |accessdate=2012-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010604232947/http://www.llc-reporter.com/16.htm |archivedate=2001-06-04 }}</ref>\n\n==Greece==\nA limited liability company (LLC) in Greece is synonymous to an EPE (\u0395\u03a0\u0395 - \u0395\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03c5\u03b8\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.taxlaw.gr/en/idika-themata/208-procedure-incorporation-greek-limited-liability-company|title=Procedure for the incorporation of a Greek Limited Liability Company (E.P.E.) - Iason Skouzos & Partners - Law Firm|first=\u0399\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9\u03bd|last=\u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03b6\u03cc\u03c2|accessdate=31 May 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803120417/http://www.taxlaw.gr/en/idika-themata/208-procedure-incorporation-greek-limited-liability-company|archivedate=3 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Hong Kong==\nIn Hong Kong, the Limited Company is the most commonly incorporated type of company<ref>[http://www.investhk.gov.hk/setting-up-your-business/company-name-and-structure.html Company type and name | English].

One of these seven types of companies and partnerships refers to LLPs. Like many other countries, two persons are required to form an LLP in Iran. Each person has his/her own shares and is responsible for business liability equivalent to his/her share percentage.

The minimum capital required by law in a private company, ''privat aktiebolag'', is SEK 50,000, although this may be in the form of assets as well as capital. The AB structure requires shareholders, a Board of Directors, and regular meetings of both, together with complete accounts once per year.

A Swiss LLC is similar to an LLC with respect to various matters, including the following: Members may also be natural persons, corporations, partnerships or other LLCs,<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 722 paragraph 1</ref> the liability of a member of a Swiss LLC to pay for the LLC's obligations is limited to its capital contribution,<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 802</ref> a Swiss LLC may be either member-managed or manager-managed,<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 811</ref> and, unless otherwise provided for in the operating agreement, the members\u2019 right to control or manage a Swiss LLC is proportionate to their individual membership interest.<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 808 paragraph 4</ref> The membership interests in a Swiss LLC have to be registered<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 790</ref> and, thus, they may only be issued in the name of a member but not to the bearer.\n\nSwiss Corporation<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, articles 620ss</ref> (in English common law context usually translated as '' [[company limited by shares]]''): The terms for this kind of company used in the three official languages of the Swiss Confederation are as follows: In German ''Aktiengesellschaft'' (abbreviation: ''AG''), in French ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme'' (abbreviation: ''SA'') and in Italian ''Societ\u00e0 Anonima'' (abbreviation: ''SA''). A Swiss corporation is with respect to various matters different from an LLC (including a Swiss LLC): Most important is that a Swiss corporation may, neither by default nor by exercising any respective option provided by the Swiss law, be member-managed like an LLC, as the respective mandatory provisions of Swiss law provide that the board of directors has certain non-transferable duties.<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 716a</ref> Furthermore, the shares of a Swiss corporation may also be issued to the bearer (bearer shares)<ref>Swiss Code of Obligations, article 622 paragraph 1</ref> and, thus, not only in the name of a holder (registered shares), which, however, applies to the membership interests in a Swiss LLC, which may only be registered.\n\n==Tajikistan==\nIn Tajikistan, the same as in Russia, an entity with a somewhat similar structure is known as \"\u04b6\u0430\u043c\u044a\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u044a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u04b3\u0434\u0443\u0434\", Chamiyti Doroi Masuliyti Machdud, abbreviated as \"\u04b6\u0414\u041c\u041c\".\n\n==Turkey==\nMinimum capital should be 10,000 TL. That capital could be the minimum total capital of company. Number of founding shareholders (real persons or legal entities) could be minimum 1 and maximum 50. All or some of the shareholders could be foreign nationals. There is no issued stock certificates and all shareholders liability is limited to their registered capital amount. 1/4 of capital should be blocked in a Bank until procedure of registration ends. The equivalent of LLC for Turkish is Ltd. \u015eti. (Which means ''[[:tr:Limited \u015firket|Limited \u015eirketi]].)''\n\n==Ukraine==\nThis type of entity has existed in [[Ukraine]] since the 1990s.

[[Authorised capital|Authorized capital]] of LLC is divided into shares (or stakes), the amount of which is determined by the charter. LLC is responsible to the creditors only with its assets. Legal entities (foreign or Ukrainian companies) individuals, regardless of their country of citizenship or residency can be the founders (participants) of LLC. Limited liability company can be formed either by one person or by several individuals or legal entities (corporations). Maximum number of participants (founders) of LLC in Ukraine is 100. Since 2014 registration procedure has been significantly simplified in Ukraine. Minimum amount of authorised capital is 1 (one) [[Ukrainian hryvnia|hryvnia]] (less than 0,04 US [[Cent (currency)|cents]]). There is no state fee for LLC formation.\n\nBy Ukrainian Law LLC dividend payment is possible after the declaration of company\u2019s income or profit to the fiscal/tax authorities and the approval of the income statement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.clc.co.ua/legal-support-of-dividend-payment/|title=Dividend payment in Ukraine|last=Thor|first=Anatoliy|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Thus, regardless of the tax system, LLC can make dividend payments up to 4 times a year, or one time a quarter.\n\nTaxation.

In accordance with Article (218) of the CCL a Limited Liability Company can be formed by a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 50 shareholders whose liability is limited to their shares in the capital of the company. Recent amendments to Article (217) of the CCL that came into force in June 2009 removed the requirement for minimum share capital (previously AED 300,000 in Dubai and AED 150,000 in other Emirates) allowing founders of a limited liability company the freedom to determine the company\u2019s share capital which could be less than the earlier prescribed bottom line. Shares of an LLC are not open for subscription by the public.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.baijumasoodu.com/articles/details/37|title=legal forms of business|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Despite the split in shareholdings, profits may be divided in other ratios agreed upon, taking into consideration efforts of foreign partners in management, provision of technology or expertise. Responsibility for the management of a LLC can be vested in the foreign partner or UAE national partners or a third party. A LLC must appoint a minimum of one manager and up to a maximum of five managers for the business. Managers must be appointed by a Memorandum of Association or by a management contract, for a fixed term or an unlimited term. Unless the Memorandum of Association states otherwise, the manager has full powers of administration and management of the LLC.\nLLC is not allowed to practice its activities in the UAE without a Trade License and Commercial Registration Certificate.\n\n<ref>trinitygroup.eu</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\nThe new form of [[limited liability partnership]] (LLP), created in 2000, is similar to a US LLC in being tax neutral: member partners are taxed at the partner level, but the LLP itself pays no tax. It is treated as a body corporate for all other purposes including [[VAT]]. Otherwise, all companies, including [[limited company|limited companies]] and US LLCs, are treated as bodies corporate subject to [[United Kingdom corporation tax]] if the profits of the entity belong to the entity and not to its members.\n\n==United States==\nA limited liability company (LLC) is a relatively new business structure authorized by [[State law (United States)|state statutes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=98277,00.html |title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) |publisher=Irs.gov |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref> The LLC is chiefly inspired by the GmbH (\"Company with limited liability\"), a type of business organization in [[Germany]], and by the {{lang|es|limitada}}, a type of business organization available in many Latin American countries.<ref name=\"LLC Reporter\" />\n\nIn the United States, the first limited liability company act appeared in [[Wyoming]] in 1977 as special interest<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legisweb.state.wy.us/statutes/statutes.aspx?file=titles/Title17/T17CH29.htm|title=State of Wyoming Legislature|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2016}}</ref> legislation for an oil company.<ref>Keatinge et al.,\"The Limited Liability Company: A Study of the Emerging Entity,\" 47 Business Lawyer 375, 383-384 (Feb. 1992) (citing Act of 4 March 1977, ch. 155, 1977 Wyo.Sess.Laws 512).</ref> In 1980, the Internal Revenue Service issued a private letter ruling to an LLC formed under the Wyoming LLC Act, indicating that the IRS would treat the LLC as a partnership for federal tax purposes.<ref>Priv.

Uniform Law Commission.</ref>\n\nA potential disadvantage specific to the United States is that LLCs are not considered to be corporations for the purposes of [[civil procedure in the United States|federal civil procedure]]; they are instead treated as partnerships. This affects the applicability of [[diversity jurisdiction]] in cases involving LLCs, barring application of diversity jurisdiction when even one member of the LLC is a citizen of the same state as one of the opposing parties. Should one member of an LLC be a citizen of a state of which one of the opposing parties is a citizen, any case between the LLC and those parties must be heard in that state's courts; corporations enjoy a more complete legal personhood that only denies diversity jurisdiction when the opposing party is a citizen of the state in which the corporation is incorporated (most commonly [[Delaware General Corporation Law|Delaware]] for large corporations, which has a small population) or has its principal place of business.\n\n[[AOL]] was set up as an LLC during its ownership by [[Time Warner]] from 2001 to 2008. There is a similar setup for [[BMW]]'s American subsidiary, BMW of North America, LLC.

He served with the [[17th Duke of York's Royal Canadian Hussars]] (17th D.Y.R.C.H.). He had risen to the rank of signal sergeant by 1913.<ref name=\"library.uvic.ca\">[http://contentdm.library.uvic.ca/cdm/ref/collection/collection13/id/367 Military Oral History collection]</ref> \"Tommy\" Burns, student # 1032 graduated from the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]] in 1914. He joined the [[Royal Canadian Engineers]], into which he was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] in 1915.\n\n==World War I==\nBurns served in Canada until March 1916 when he went overseas with the 3rd Canadian Division Signal Company which, was composed of engineers.\nHe fought on the Western Front with the Royal Canadian Engineers from 1916 to 1918. He became a staff officer with the 9th Brigade in March 1917, dealing with supply and personnel. He became a \"staff learner\" and acted as liaison officer between forward battalions and brigade headquarters. He returned to Canada in 1919 and was stationed at St. John as an engineer officer.<ref name=\"library.uvic.ca\"/>\n\n==Between the wars==\nBurns attended the School of Military Engineering, Chatham, England, for eighteen months. He was an instructor at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. He returned to Halifax and served on duty during the miners' strike at Glace Bay. He worked in the Survey Department in Ottawa. In 1924, he was appointed as an instructor at [[Royal Military College of Canada|RMC]] in field engineering. He attended the [[Command and Staff College|Staff College, Quetta]], British India and returned to Quebec, Canada in 1930.<ref name=\"library.uvic.ca\"/> In 1939, as a lieutenant colonel, he attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in [[London, England]].\n\n==World War II==\nDuring [[World War II]] Burns successively commanded the [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]], the [[1st Canadian Division|1st Canadian Infantry Division]], the [[5th Canadian Division|5th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] (January 1944 to March 1944), and then finally [[I Canadian Corps]] (March 1944 until November 1944). His performance as a corps-level commander proved to be controversial, despite the successes of the Canadian forces in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], and so he was replaced as commander of I Canadian Corps by [[Lieutenant-general (Canada)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Charles Foulkes (Canadian Army general)|Charles Foulkes]].\n\n==Later life==\nBurns served as Deputy Minister of Veterans\u2019 Affairs. He served as a President of the [[United Nations Association of Canada|UNAC]] during the 1950s. He played a critical role in the Middle East peace process from 1954 to 1959. He was instrumental in developing UN [[peacekeeping]]. As Chief of Staff in 1954, [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization]] (UNTSO) was designed to maintain the General Armistice Agreements until permanent peace could be formulated.\n\nBurns served as a Chief of Staff of the Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine (1954\u201356) and was thus nearby when the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 occurred. He then led [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] as Force Commander from November 1956 to December 1959. He was Canada's principal [[disarmament]] negotiator from 1960\u201368.\n\nBurns held the chair of Strategic Studies at the Norman Paterson School for International Affairs, [[Carleton University]] from 1969\u201375.

His military career has, for the most part, been criticised by historians as showing he was \"simply incapable of commanding a higher formation.\"<ref>Lofgen, 2006</ref>\n\n==Early education==\n[[File:Tommy Burns, Royal Military College of Canada cadet.jpg|thumb|left|220px|E. L. M. Burns, Royal Military College of Canada cadet]]  \nE.L.M. Burns was born on June 17, 1897 in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. His father was a militia staff officer, a member of the Corps of Guides. He served with the [[17th Duke of York's Royal Canadian Hussars]] (17th D.Y.R.C.H.). He had risen to the rank of signal sergeant by 1913.<ref name=\"library.uvic.ca\">[http://contentdm.library.uvic.ca/cdm/ref/collection/collection13/id/367 Military Oral History collection]</ref> \"Tommy\" Burns, student # 1032 graduated from the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]] in 1914. He joined the [[Royal Canadian Engineers]], into which he was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] in 1915.\n\n==World War I==\nBurns served in Canada until March 1916 when he went overseas with the 3rd Canadian Division Signal Company which, was composed of engineers.\nHe fought on the Western Front with the Royal Canadian Engineers from 1916 to 1918. He became a staff officer with the 9th Brigade in March 1917, dealing with supply and personnel. He became a \"staff learner\" and acted as liaison officer between forward battalions and brigade headquarters. He returned to Canada in 1919 and was stationed at St. John as an engineer officer.<ref name=\"library.uvic.ca\"/>\n\n==Between the wars==\nBurns attended the School of Military Engineering, Chatham, England, for eighteen months. He was an instructor at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. He returned to Halifax and served on duty during the miners' strike at Glace Bay. He worked in the Survey Department in Ottawa. In 1924, he was appointed as an instructor at [[Royal Military College of Canada|RMC]] in field engineering. He attended the [[Command and Staff College|Staff College, Quetta]], British India and returned to Quebec, Canada in 1930.<ref name=\"library.uvic.ca\"/> In 1939, as a lieutenant colonel, he attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]] in [[London, England]].\n\n==World War II==\nDuring [[World War II]] Burns successively commanded the [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]], the [[1st Canadian Division|1st Canadian Infantry Division]], the [[5th Canadian Division|5th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] (January 1944 to March 1944), and then finally [[I Canadian Corps]] (March 1944 until November 1944). His performance as a corps-level commander proved to be controversial, despite the successes of the Canadian forces in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], and so he was replaced as commander of I Canadian Corps by [[Lieutenant-general (Canada)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Charles Foulkes (Canadian Army general)|Charles Foulkes]].\n\n==Later life==\nBurns served as Deputy Minister of Veterans\u2019 Affairs. He served as a President of the [[United Nations Association of Canada|UNAC]] during the 1950s. He played a critical role in the Middle East peace process from 1954 to 1959. He was instrumental in developing UN [[peacekeeping]]. As Chief of Staff in 1954, [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization]] (UNTSO) was designed to maintain the General Armistice Agreements until permanent peace could be formulated.\n\nBurns served as a Chief of Staff of the Truce Supervision Organization in Palestine (1954\u201356) and was thus nearby when the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 occurred. He then led [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] as Force Commander from November 1956 to December 1959. He was Canada's principal [[disarmament]] negotiator from 1960-68.\n\nBurns held the chair of Strategic Studies at the Norman Paterson School for International Affairs, [[Carleton University]] from 1969-75. He wrote \"Between Arab and Israeli\" (1962); \"General Mud: Memoirs of Two World Wars\" (1970) and \"Defense in the Nuclear Age\" (1976).\n\n==Honours==\n[[File:Wall of Honour, Royal Military College of Canada.jpg|thumb|left|Wall of Honour, Royal Military College of Canada]]\n\nBurns was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for maintaining communications under heavy fire, and, for the same action at the Somme, his non-commissioned officers received [[Military Medal]]s.\n\nIn 1967 Burns was made a [[Companion of the Order of Canada]] for his services to Canada at home and abroad. He was described as a Former Chief of General Staff and Canadian adviser on disarmament in Geneva. In 1970, he received an honorary doctorate from [[Sir George Williams University]], which later became [[Concordia University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.concordia.ca/burns|title=Honorary Degree Citation - Eedson Louis Millard Burns* {{!}} Concordia University Archives|website=archives.concordia.ca|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>\n\nBurns was the 1981 recipient of the [[Pearson Medal of Peace]] for his work in the [[military of Canada]]. He is a 2010 induction to the Wall of Honour at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]]. There is also a park located in [[Nepean, Ontario|Nepean]] named after him.\n\nA mannequin at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]] wears \"Tommy\" Burns' khaki army uniform jacket, covered with medals and wrapped with a Sam Browne belt.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Burns, Lieutenant-General E.L.M.
