[[Total Football]] ({{lang-nl|Totaalvoetbal}}), pioneered by [[Feyenoord]] and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and led by playmaker [[Johan Cruyff]] and national team coach [[Rinus Michels]]. The Dutch made huge strides, qualifying for two World Cup finals in the decade. The captain of the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian]] team that won the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]], [[Carlos Alberto Torres|Carlos Alberto]], went on to say ''\"The only team I\u2019ve seen that did things differently was Holland at [[1974 FIFA World Cup|the 1974 World Cup in Germany]]. Since then everything looks more or less the same to me\u2026. Their \u2018carousel\u2019 style of play was amazing to watch and marvellous for the game.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomwfootball.com/2010/10/15/tactics-were-holland-1974-the-last-true-innovators/ |title=Tactics: Were Holland 1974 the last true innovators? |publisher=Football Further |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2010-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702120848/http://www.tomwfootball.com/2010/10/15/tactics-were-holland-1974-the-last-true-innovators/ |archive-date=2015-07-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, the Netherlands beat both [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the second group stage, reaching the final for the first time in their history. However, the team lost to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in [[1974 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]] in [[Munich]], despite having gone 1\u20130 up through [[Johan Neeskens]]' early [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] before any German had even touched the ball. However, supported by the crowd, a converted penalty by [[Paul Breitner]] and the winner from [[Gerd M\u00fcller]] led to a victory for the Germans.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0716-0311, Fu\u00dfball-WM, BRD - Niederlande 2-1.jpg|left|thumb|The Dutch team before their 1\u20132 loss against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the final of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]]]]\n\nBy comparison, [[UEFA Euro 1976|Euro '76]] was a disappointment. The Netherlands lost in the semi-finals to [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], as much because of fighting within the squad and the coach [[George Knobel]], as well as the skill of the eventual winners.\n\nIn 1978, the Netherlands again reached the final of a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], only to be beaten by the host, this time Argentina. This side played without [[Johan Cruijff]], [[Willem van Hanegem]], and [[Jan van Beveren]], who refused to participate in the World Cup. It still contained [[Johan Neeskens]], [[Johnny Rep]], [[Arie Haan]], [[Ruud Krol]], [[Wim Jansen]], [[Jan Jongbloed]], [[Wim Suurbier]] and [[Rob Rensenbrink]] from the 1974 selection. The Netherlands were less impressive in the group stages. They qualified as runners-up, after a draw with [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and a loss to [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. In the second group phase, however, the Netherlands topped a group including [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and West Germany, setting up [[1978 FIFA World Cup Final|a final with Argentina]]. However, the Dutch finished as runners up for the second World Cup in a row as they ultimately lost 3\u20131 after two [[extra time]] goals from Argentina. Unfortunately for the Dutch, Rensenbrink hit the Argentinian post in the last minute of normal time, with the score 1\u20131.\n\n====1974 FIFA World Cup====\n'''Qualification'''\n{{main|1974 FIFA

Veterans such as Krol and Rensenbrink retired soon afterwards and the Netherlands missed the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro '84]], and the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in succession. Qualification for Euro 1984 was within reach, but the Dutch ended the campaign on the same number of points as rivals Spain, and the same goal difference (+16). Spain advanced having scored two more goals. The failure to reach the 1986 World Cup was also very close. In a play off with neighbours Belgium, the Netherlands lost 1\u20130 in [[Brussels]], but were leading 2\u20130 in the home leg in [[Rotterdam]] with a few minutes remaining. Belgium scored to end the tie 2\u20131, and overall play off 2\u20132. Belgium advanced on the away goal rule.\n\n===European champions===\n----\n[[File:De Beker.jpg|thumb|upright|The 1988 trophy on display in [[Amsterdam]]]]\n[[File:Persconferentie ivm vertrek van bondscoach Kees Rijvers en de opvolging van hem , Bestanddeelnr 933-1361.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Rinus Michels]]]]\n[[Rinus Michels]] returned to coach the team for the [[UEFA Euro 1988|Euro '88]] tournament. After losing the first group match against the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]] (1\u20130), the Netherlands went on to qualify for the semi-final by defeating [[England national football team|England]] 3\u20131 (with a hat-trick by the tournament's top scorer [[Marco van Basten]]), and [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] (1\u20130). For many Dutch football supporters, the most important match in the tournament was the semi-final against West Germany, the host country, considered a revenge for the lost 1974 World Cup final (also in West Germany). [[Marco van Basten]], who would later become national team coach, scored in the 89th minute of the game to sink the German side. The game is also remembered for its post-match shenanigans, including [[Ronald Koeman]], who, in front of the German supporters, provocatively pretended to wipe his backside with the shirt of [[Olaf Thon]] as if it were toilet paper, an action Koeman later stated he regretted.<ref>[http://ajaxusa.blogspot.ch/2004/02/cheeseheads-vs-krauts-30-years-of.html \"Cheeseheads vs Krauts\": 30 Years of Enmity], ''Ajax-USA.com'', June 14, 2004</ref> The Netherlands won the final with a convincing victory over the USSR, a rematch on the round robin game, through a header by [[Ruud Gullit]] and a volley by van Basten. This was the national team's first major tournament win and it restored them to the forefront of international football for the next three years after almost a decade in the wilderness.\n\nDespite high expectations as the team entered the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]], the tournament was not a success. Van Basten failed to score, as he was frequently marked by opposing defenders, while Gullit was ineffective having not fully recovered from injury. The Dutch managed to advance despite drawing all three group games, meeting their arch-rivals West Germany in the round of 16. The match is most remembered for the spitting-incident involving [[Frank Rijkaard]] and [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]] as the Netherlands lost 2\u20131.\n\nThe team reached the semi-finals in the [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro '92]], which was noted for the emergence of [[Dennis Bergkamp]], but they were eliminated by eventual champions [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], with Van Basten's kick in the penalty shootout being saved by [[Peter Schmeichel]]. This was to be van Basten's last major tournament as he suffered a serious ankle injury shortly after, eventually conceding defeat and retiring at the age of 30 in 1995.\n\nIn the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], in the absence of the injured van Basten and the [[Strike action|striking]] Gullit, [[Dennis Bergkamp]] led the team with three goals and the Netherlands advanced to the quarter-finals, where they lost 3\u20132 to eventual champions [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].\n\n===1996\u20132004===\n----\nAt [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]], after drawing 0\u20130 with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and beating [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 2\u20130, they faced the hosts England in the pool A decider, with both teams on 4 points. After 62 minutes, with Scotland beating Switzerland 1\u20130, the Netherlands were 4\u20130 down and looked like finishing third behind Scotland on goal difference and going out of the tournament, but [[Patrick Kluivert]] converted a [[Dennis Bergkamp]] assist and scored in the 78th minute to see the Dutch finish second on goals scored. They then played [[France national football team|France]] in the quarter-finals, drawing 0\u20130 and being eliminated 5\u20134 on penalties.\n\n[[File:Scotland-holland euro 96.jpg|thumb|left|The Netherlands at [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] in a match against Scotland.]]\nIn the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], Netherlands, whose team included [[Marc Overmars]], [[Phillip Cocu]], [[Edgar Davids]], [[Frank de Boer]], [[Ronald de Boer]], and [[Patrick Kluivert]], met [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the quarter-final, a rematch of the 1978 final. Near the end of regular time, after an unsuccessful [[Diving (association football)|dive]] to draw a penalty, Argentinian [[Ariel Ortega]] head-butted [[Edwin van der Sar]].<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/events/1998/worldcup/news/1998/07/04/philjones_04/ |title=The Netherlands pay back controversial loss to Argentina |accessdate=2007-08-22 |author=Phil Jones |date=1998-07-04  |publisher=sportsillustrated.cnn.com}}\n</ref> Ortega was sent off and the Netherlands won 2\u20131 after a Bergkamp goal in the 89th minute. Bergkamp's goal was famous because of its quality \u2014 he touched down a {{Convert|60|yd|m|adj=on}} pass from [[Frank de Boer]] then reverse-flicked it inside [[Roberto Ayala]] and finally volleyed it past the Argentine goalkeeper. In the semi-final, the Netherlands took [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] to a penalty shootout after a late Kluivert goal tied the match 1\u20131, but Brazil won the shootout 4\u20132 and advanced to the final. Netherlands lost the third place match 2\u20131 to upstart [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].  Soon after the World Cup exit manager [[Guus Hiddink]] resigned after two tournaments in charge and was replaced by legendary ex-midfielder [[Frank Rijkaard]].\n\nNetherlands co-hosted [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]] with [[Belgium]] and were one of the favourites coming into the tournament. Getting all three wins in the group stage, including a win over reigning world champions France, they then crushed Yugoslavia 6\u20131 in the quarter-finals, with Kluivert getting a hat-trick. In the semi-finals, their opponents, Italy, went down to ten men in the first half and the Netherlands were awarded two [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s but failed to convert either chance. Italian goalkeeper [[Francesco Toldo]] made two saves in the shootout (in addition to his penalty save in regulation time) to eliminate the Netherlands.  [[Dennis Bergkamp]], who failed to score during the tournament, retired from the national team after Euro 2000 (partly due to his [[fear of flying]] effectively ruling him out from the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] which was to be held in [[East Asia]].) Coach [[Frank Rijkaard]] was widely criticized by the press after the defeat to the Italians as the Dutch had squandered several chances to kill the game.  Rijkaard resigned, with [[Louis van Gaal]] taking over.  Van Gaal is credited with initially bringing through the backbone of this Dutch side whilst manager of Ajax during the mid nineties, including [[Edwin van der Sar]], [[Edgar Davids]], [[Michael Reiziger]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Marc Overmars]], [[Patrick Kluivert]] and the De Boer twins.\n\n[[File:Training Netherlands in Freiburg.JPG|thumb|left|325px|Netherlands at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]]]\nSurprisingly the Netherlands failed to qualify for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], with crucial losses to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], the latter of which eliminated them from the Finals tournament. [[Louis van Gaal|Van Gaal]] resigned at the conclusion of the Netherlands' unsuccessful campaign.\n\n[[Dick Advocaat]] returned to coach the Netherlands for a second time and led the team to the semifinals of [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] but lost to Portugal and, after receiving criticism for his tactics and player changes, stepped down.  This was to be the end for many of the team's World Cup veterans (mostly made up of [[AFC Ajax#The Van Gaal era: European success and Decline|the Ajax generation of 1995]].)  [[Frank de Boer|Frank]] and [[Ronald de Boer]], [[Edgar Davids]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Marc Overmars]], [[Jaap Stam]], and [[Patrick Kluivert]] had either retired or were not selected for the upcoming World Cup by new coach [[Marco van Basten]].\n\n===2006\u20132010===\n----\n[[File:Training II der Niederlande1.JPG|thumb|left|Training in Germany]]\n\nThe Netherlands qualified for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in Germany and finished second in Group C after beating [[Serbia national football team|Serbia & Montenegro]] (1\u20130) and [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] (2\u20131) and drawing [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (0\u20130). Both Argentina and the Netherlands finished the group stage with seven points, but the Argentinians had a superior goal difference and finished first as a result. The Dutch were eliminated in the second round after losing 1\u20130 to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], in a match that produced 16 yellow cards (which matched the World Cup record for most cautions in one game set in 2002) and set a new World Cup record of four red cards (two for either side) and was nicknamed \"the [[Battle of Nuremberg (association football)|Battle of Nuremberg]]\" by the press.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200606/s1671528.htm |title=Portugal wins battle of Nuremberg |accessdate=2007-08-22 |author=Stuart Watt |date=2006-06-26 |publisher=www.abc.net.au }}\n</ref> Despite criticism surrounding his selection policy and the lack of attacking football from his team, [[Marco van Basten]] was offered a two-year extension to his contract by the Dutch FA, which would allow him to serve as national coach during [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] and the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]. The move was widely regarded as a vote of confidence in van Basten and his assistants by the [[Royal Dutch Football Association|KNVB]] officials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.football.co.uk/netherlands/van_basten_on_right_track_230197.shtml |title=Van Basten on right track |accessdate=4 May 2012 |date=27 June 2006 |publisher=Football.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Holland - France Euro 2008 entrance into stadium.JPG|thumb|Netherlands \u2013 France at Euro 2008]]\nThe Netherlands began their [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group G|Euro 2008 campaign]] with a win in [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] on 2 September 2006. On 8 September 2007, the Oranje beat [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] at the [[Amsterdam Arena]] on goals by [[Wesley Sneijder]] and [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]]. On 12 September 2007, the Netherlands won a hard-fought victory against [[Albania national football team|Albania]], with van Nistelrooy scoring the winning goal in stoppage time. This win took the Dutch squad into second place in Group G, on par with [[Romania national football team|Romania]] for points, but behind on goal differential. The Oranje were beaten 1\u20130 in Romania on 13 October 2007, but four days later, the Netherlands' 2\u20130 victory over [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]], while rivals Bulgaria could only draw in Albania, left the Dutch needing one win from their last two games, at home to Luxembourg and away to [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]], to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]].\n\nThe Netherlands played their first game in 2008 against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in [[Split (city)|Split]]. The team, without Ruud van Nistelrooy, [[Robin van Persie]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Orlando Engelaar]] and [[Arjen Robben]], won the match 3\u20130. The first goal was scored by [[John Heitinga]] on a header, while [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]] scored the second goal on an assist from [[Tim de Cler]]. The final goal came from [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] striker [[Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink]]. The team used a new formation under [[Marco van Basten]], scrapping the previously used 4\u20133\u20133 formation for a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131.\n\nThe Dutch team was a participant in the \"[[Group of Death]],\" together with [[France national football team|France]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and Romania. They began Euro 2008 with a 3\u20130 win over World Cup Champion Italy in [[Bern]] on 9 June 2008. This was the Netherlands' first victory over Italy since [[1978 World Cup|1978]]. In their second group match against France on 13 June 2008, the Netherlands won convincingly with a 4\u20131 score. The Dutch closed out an incredible group stage campaign with a 2\u20130 win over Romania. However, they lost in the quarter-final to former coach [[Guus Hiddink]]'s [[Russia national football team|Russia]] by 3\u20131, despite a late 86th-minute equalizer by Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\n[[File:Netherlands - Denmark WC2010.jpg|thumb|Netherlands \u2013 Denmark at the 2010 World Cup]]\nUnder new coach Bert van Marwijk, the Dutch team went on to secure a 100 percent record in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 9|their World Cup 2010 qualification campaign]], winning all eight games and becoming the first European team to qualify for [[2010 FIFA World Cup|the World Cup]].

On June 14 the Dutch won 2\u20130 against Denmark in their opener at the World Cup. On June 19 they then beat Japan 1\u20130 with a goal from Wesley Sneijder. They were the first team to qualify for the [[Round of 16]] after a 2\u20131 victory from Denmark over Cameroon. In the first knockout round they faced [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]]. At the end it was 2\u20131 victory after goals from [[Arjen Robben]] and [[Wesley Sneijder]]. The conceded goal came in injury time from a penalty taken by [[R\u00f3bert Vittek]].  They advanced to the semifinals with a 2\u20131 victory over the favoured Brazilians on July 2, 2010. Brazil, who had held a 1\u20130 lead at the half, was the favourite to win the cup, had never lost in 37 World Cup matches (35\u20130\u20132) in which they had held a halftime lead. The first Dutch goal was originally ruled an own goal by [[Felipe Melo]], but was later officially changed to a goal by [[Wesley Sneijder]]. The second came from a corner kick headed into the net by [[Wesley Sneijder]] despite being the shortest player on the field. In the semi-final the Dutch beat [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] 3\u20132 to advance to their first World Cup final since 1978.  The Dutch hoped to cap off an undefeated run through the World Cup, but lost to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] 1\u20130 after midfielder [[Andr\u00e9s Iniesta]] scored in extra time. This final also became [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]]'s last match in professional football.\n\nFrom August to September 2011, the team was ranked number 1 in the [[FIFA World Rankings]], thus becoming the second national football team, after Spain, to top the rankings without previously winning a World Cup.

[[Total Football]] ({{lang-nl|Totaalvoetbal}}), pioneered by [[Feyenoord]] and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and led by playmaker [[Johan Cruyff]] and national team coach [[Rinus Michels]]. The Dutch made huge strides, qualifying for two World Cup finals in the decade. The captain of the [[Brazil national football team|Brazilian]] team that won the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]], [[Carlos Alberto Torres|Carlos Alberto]], went on to say ''\"The only team I\u2019ve seen that did things differently was Holland at [[1974 FIFA World Cup|the 1974 World Cup in Germany]]. Since then everything looks more or less the same to me\u2026. Their \u2018carousel\u2019 style of play was amazing to watch and marvellous for the game.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomwfootball.com/2010/10/15/tactics-were-holland-1974-the-last-true-innovators/ |title=Tactics: Were Holland 1974 the last true innovators? |publisher=Football Further |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2010-10-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702120848/http://www.tomwfootball.com/2010/10/15/tactics-were-holland-1974-the-last-true-innovators/ |archive-date=2015-07-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1974, the Netherlands beat both [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the second group stage, reaching the final for the first time in their history. However, the team lost to [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in [[1974 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]] in [[Munich]], despite having gone 1\u20130 up through [[Johan Neeskens]]' early [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]] before any German had even touched the ball. However, supported by the crowd, a converted penalty by [[Paul Breitner]] and the winner from [[Gerd M\u00fcller]] led to a victory for the Germans.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0716-0311, Fu\u00dfball-WM, BRD - Niederlande 2-1.jpg|left|thumb|The Dutch team before their 1\u20132 loss against [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in the final of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]]]]\n\nBy comparison, [[UEFA Euro 1976|Euro '76]] was a disappointment. The Netherlands lost in the semi-finals to [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], as much because of fighting within the squad and the coach [[George Knobel]], as well as the skill of the eventual winners.\n\nIn 1978, the Netherlands again reached the final of a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], only to be beaten by the host, this time Argentina. This side played without [[Johan Cruijff]], [[Willem van Hanegem]], and [[Jan van Beveren]], who refused to participate in the World Cup. It still contained [[Johan Neeskens]], [[Johnny Rep]], [[Arie Haan]], [[Ruud Krol]], [[Wim Jansen]], [[Jan Jongbloed]], [[Wim Suurbier]] and [[Rob Rensenbrink]] from the 1974 selection. The Netherlands were less impressive in the group stages. They qualified as runners-up, after a draw with [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and a loss to [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]. In the second group phase, however, the Netherlands topped a group including [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and West Germany, setting up [[1978 FIFA World Cup Final|a final with Argentina]]. However, the Dutch finished as runners up for the second World Cup in a row as they ultimately lost 3\u20131 after two [[extra time]] goals from Argentina. Unfortunately for the Dutch, Rensenbrink hit the Argentinian post in the last minute of normal time, with the score 1\u20131.\n\n====1974 FIFA World Cup====\n'''Qualification'''\n{{main|1974 FIFA

Veterans such as Krol and Rensenbrink retired soon afterwards and the Netherlands missed the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro '84]], and the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] in succession. Qualification for Euro 1984 was within reach, but the Dutch ended the campaign on the same number of points as rivals Spain, and the same goal difference (+16). Spain advanced having scored two more goals. The failure to reach the 1986 World Cup was also very close. In a play off with neighbours Belgium, the Netherlands lost 1\u20130 in [[Brussels]], but were leading 2\u20130 in the home leg in [[Rotterdam]] with a few minutes remaining. Belgium scored to end the tie 2\u20131, and overall play off 2\u20132. Belgium advanced on the away goal rule.\n\n===European champions===\n----\n[[File:De Beker.jpg|thumb|upright|The 1988 trophy on display in [[Amsterdam]]]]\n[[File:Persconferentie ivm vertrek van bondscoach Kees Rijvers en de opvolging van hem , Bestanddeelnr 933-1361.jpg|thumb|left|160px|[[Rinus Michels]]]]\n[[Rinus Michels]] returned to coach the team for the [[UEFA Euro 1988|Euro '88]] tournament. After losing the first group match against the [[USSR national football team|Soviet Union]] (1\u20130), the Netherlands went on to qualify for the semi-final by defeating [[England national football team|England]] 3\u20131 (with a hat-trick by the tournament's top scorer [[Marco van Basten]]), and [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] (1\u20130). For many Dutch football supporters, the most important match in the tournament was the semi-final against West Germany, the host country, considered a revenge for the lost 1974 World Cup final (also in West Germany). [[Marco van Basten]], who would later become national team coach, scored in the 89th minute of the game to sink the German side. The game is also remembered for its post-match shenanigans, including [[Ronald Koeman]], who, in front of the German supporters, provocatively pretended to wipe his backside with the shirt of [[Olaf Thon]] as if it were toilet paper, an action Koeman later stated he regretted.<ref>[http://ajaxusa.blogspot.ch/2004/02/cheeseheads-vs-krauts-30-years-of.html \"Cheeseheads vs Krauts\": 30 Years of Enmity], ''Ajax-USA.com'', June 14, 2004</ref> The Netherlands won the final with a convincing victory over the USSR, a rematch on the round robin game, through a header by [[Ruud Gullit]] and a volley by van Basten. This was the national team's first major tournament win and it restored them to the forefront of international football for the next three years after almost a decade in the wilderness.\n\nDespite high expectations as the team entered the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]], the tournament was not a success. Van Basten failed to score, as he was frequently marked by opposing defenders, while Gullit was ineffective having not fully recovered from injury. The Dutch managed to advance despite drawing all three group games, meeting their arch-rivals West Germany in the round of 16. The match is most remembered for the spitting-incident involving [[Frank Rijkaard]] and [[Rudi V\u00f6ller]] as the Netherlands lost 2\u20131.\n\nThe team reached the semi-finals in the [[UEFA Euro 1992|Euro '92]], which was noted for the emergence of [[Dennis Bergkamp]], but they were eliminated by eventual champions [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], with Van Basten's kick in the penalty shootout being saved by [[Peter Schmeichel]]. This was to be van Basten's last major tournament as he suffered a serious ankle injury shortly after, eventually conceding defeat and retiring at the age of 30 in 1995.\n\nIn the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], in the absence of the injured van Basten and the [[Strike action|striking]] Gullit, [[Dennis Bergkamp]] led the team with three goals and the Netherlands advanced to the quarter-finals, where they lost 3\u20132 to eventual champions [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].\n\n===1996\u20132004===\n----\nAt [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]], after drawing 0\u20130 with [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and beating [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] 2\u20130, they faced the hosts England in the pool A decider, with both teams on 4 points. After 62 minutes, with Scotland beating Switzerland 1\u20130, the Netherlands were 4\u20130 down and looked like finishing third behind Scotland on goal difference and going out of the tournament, but [[Patrick Kluivert]] converted a [[Dennis Bergkamp]] assist and scored in the 78th minute to see the Dutch finish second on goals scored. They then played [[France national football team|France]] in the quarter-finals, drawing 0\u20130 and being eliminated 5\u20134 on penalties.\n\n[[File:Scotland-holland euro 96.jpg|thumb|left|The Netherlands at [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] in a match against Scotland.]]\nIn the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], Netherlands, whose team included [[Marc Overmars]], [[Phillip Cocu]], [[Edgar Davids]], [[Frank de Boer]], [[Ronald de Boer]], and [[Patrick Kluivert]], met [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the quarter-final, a rematch of the 1978 final. Near the end of regular time, after an unsuccessful [[Diving (association football)|dive]] to draw a penalty, Argentinian [[Ariel Ortega]] head-butted [[Edwin van der Sar]].<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/events/1998/worldcup/news/1998/07/04/philjones_04/ |title=The Netherlands pay back controversial loss to Argentina |accessdate=2007-08-22 |author=Phil Jones |date=1998-07-04  |publisher=sportsillustrated.cnn.com}}\n</ref> Ortega was sent off and the Netherlands won 2\u20131 after a Bergkamp goal in the 89th minute. Bergkamp's goal was famous because of its quality \u2014 he touched down a {{Convert|60|yd|m|adj=on}} pass from [[Frank de Boer]] then reverse-flicked it inside [[Roberto Ayala]] and finally volleyed it past the Argentine goalkeeper. In the semi-final, the Netherlands took [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] to a penalty shootout after a late Kluivert goal tied the match 1\u20131, but Brazil won the shootout 4\u20132 and advanced to the final. Netherlands lost the third place match 2\u20131 to upstart [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].  Soon after the World Cup exit manager [[Guus Hiddink]] resigned after two tournaments in charge and was replaced by legendary ex-midfielder [[Frank Rijkaard]].\n\nNetherlands co-hosted [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]] with [[Belgium]] and were one of the favourites coming into the tournament. Getting all three wins in the group stage, including a win over reigning world champions France, they then crushed Yugoslavia 6\u20131 in the quarter-finals, with Kluivert getting a hat-trick. In the semi-finals, their opponents, Italy, went down to ten men in the first half and the Netherlands were awarded two [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s but failed to convert either chance. Italian goalkeeper [[Francesco Toldo]] made two saves in the shootout (in addition to his penalty save in regulation time) to eliminate the Netherlands.  [[Dennis Bergkamp]], who failed to score during the tournament, retired from the national team after Euro 2000 (partly due to his [[fear of flying]] effectively ruling him out from the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] which was to be held in [[East Asia]].) Coach [[Frank Rijkaard]] was widely criticized by the press after the defeat to the Italians as the Dutch had squandered several chances to kill the game.  Rijkaard resigned, with [[Louis van Gaal]] taking over.  Van Gaal is credited with initially bringing through the backbone of this Dutch side whilst manager of Ajax during the mid nineties, including [[Edwin van der Sar]], [[Edgar Davids]], [[Michael Reiziger]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Marc Overmars]], [[Patrick Kluivert]] and the De Boer twins.\n\n[[File:Training Netherlands in Freiburg.JPG|thumb|left|325px|Netherlands at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]]]\nSurprisingly the Netherlands failed to qualify for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], with crucial losses to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], the latter of which eliminated them from the Finals tournament. [[Louis van Gaal|Van Gaal]] resigned at the conclusion of the Netherlands' unsuccessful campaign.\n\n[[Dick Advocaat]] returned to coach the Netherlands for a second time and led the team to the semifinals of [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] but lost to Portugal and, after receiving criticism for his tactics and player changes, stepped down.  This was to be the end for many of the team's World Cup veterans (mostly made up of [[AFC Ajax#The Van Gaal era: European success and Decline|the Ajax generation of 1995]].)  [[Frank de Boer|Frank]] and [[Ronald de Boer]], [[Edgar Davids]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Marc Overmars]], [[Jaap Stam]], and [[Patrick Kluivert]] had either retired or were not selected for the upcoming World Cup by new coach [[Marco van Basten]].\n\n===2006\u20132010===\n----\n[[File:Training II der Niederlande1.JPG|thumb|left|Training in Germany]]\n\nThe Netherlands qualified for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in Germany and finished second in Group C after beating [[Serbia national football team|Serbia & Montenegro]] (1\u20130) and [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] (2\u20131) and drawing [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (0\u20130). Both Argentina and the Netherlands finished the group stage with seven points, but the Argentinians had a superior goal difference and finished first as a result. The Dutch were eliminated in the second round after losing 1\u20130 to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], in a match that produced 16 yellow cards (which matched the World Cup record for most cautions in one game set in 2002) and set a new World Cup record of four red cards (two for either side) and was nicknamed \"the [[Battle of Nuremberg (association football)|Battle of Nuremberg]]\" by the press.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200606/s1671528.htm |title=Portugal wins battle of Nuremberg |accessdate=2007-08-22 |author=Stuart Watt |date=2006-06-26 |publisher=www.abc.net.au }}\n</ref> Despite criticism surrounding his selection policy and the lack of attacking football from his team, [[Marco van Basten]] was offered a two-year extension to his contract by the Dutch FA, which would allow him to serve as national coach during [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]] and the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]. The move was widely regarded as a vote of confidence in van Basten and his assistants by the [[Royal Dutch Football Association|KNVB]] officials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.football.co.uk/netherlands/van_basten_on_right_track_230197.shtml |title=Van Basten on right track |accessdate=4 May 2012 |date=27 June 2006 |publisher=Football.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Holland - France Euro 2008 entrance into stadium.JPG|thumb|Netherlands \u2013 France at Euro 2008]]\nThe Netherlands began their [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying Group G|Euro 2008 campaign]] with a win in [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] on 2 September 2006. On 8 September 2007, the Oranje beat [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] at the [[Amsterdam Arena]] on goals by [[Wesley Sneijder]] and [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]]. On 12 September 2007, the Netherlands won a hard-fought victory against [[Albania national football team|Albania]], with van Nistelrooy scoring the winning goal in stoppage time. This win took the Dutch squad into second place in Group G, on par with [[Romania national football team|Romania]] for points, but behind on goal differential. The Oranje were beaten 1\u20130 in Romania on 13 October 2007, but four days later, the Netherlands' 2\u20130 victory over [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]], while rivals Bulgaria could only draw in Albania, left the Dutch needing one win from their last two games, at home to Luxembourg and away to [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]], to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]].\n\nThe Netherlands played their first game in 2008 against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in [[Split (city)|Split]]. The team, without Ruud van Nistelrooy, [[Robin van Persie]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Orlando Engelaar]] and [[Arjen Robben]], won the match 3\u20130. The first goal was scored by [[John Heitinga]] on a header, while [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]] scored the second goal on an assist from [[Tim de Cler]]. The final goal came from [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] striker [[Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink]]. The team used a new formation under [[Marco van Basten]], scrapping the previously used 4\u20133\u20133 formation for a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131.\n\nThe Dutch team was a participant in the \"[[Group of Death]],\" together with [[France national football team|France]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and Romania. They began Euro 2008 with a 3\u20130 win over World Cup Champion Italy in [[Bern]] on 9 June 2008. This was the Netherlands' first victory over Italy since [[1978 World Cup|1978]]. In their second group match against France on 13 June 2008, the Netherlands won convincingly with a 4\u20131 score. The Dutch closed out an incredible group stage campaign with a 2\u20130 win over Romania. However, they lost in the quarter-final to former coach [[Guus Hiddink]]'s [[Russia national football team|Russia]] by 3\u20131, despite a late 86th-minute equalizer by Ruud van Nistelrooy.\n\n[[File:Netherlands - Denmark WC2010.jpg|thumb|Netherlands \u2013 Denmark at the 2010 World Cup]]\nUnder new coach Bert van Marwijk, the Dutch team went on to secure a 100 percent record in [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 UEFA Group 9|their World Cup 2010 qualification campaign]], winning all eight games and becoming the first European team to qualify for [[2010 FIFA World Cup|the World Cup]].

On June 14 the Dutch won 2\u20130 against Denmark in their opener at the World Cup. On June 19 they then beat Japan 1\u20130 with a goal from Wesley Sneijder. They were the first team to qualify for the [[Round of 16]] after a 2\u20131 victory from Denmark over Cameroon. In the first knockout round they faced [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]]. At the end it was 2\u20131 victory after goals from [[Arjen Robben]] and [[Wesley Sneijder]]. The conceded goal came in injury time from a penalty taken by [[R\u00f3bert Vittek]].  They advanced to the semifinals with a 2\u20131 victory over the favoured Brazilians on July 2, 2010. Brazil, who had held a 1\u20130 lead at the half, was the favourite to win the cup, had never lost in 37 World Cup matches (35\u20130\u20132) in which they had held a halftime lead. The first Dutch goal was originally ruled an own goal by [[Felipe Melo]], but was later officially changed to a goal by [[Wesley Sneijder]]. The second came from a corner kick headed into the net by [[Wesley Sneijder]] despite being the shortest player on the field. In the semi-final the Dutch beat [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] 3\u20132 to advance to their first World Cup final since 1978.  The Dutch hoped to cap off an undefeated run through the World Cup, but lost to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] 1\u20130 after midfielder [[Andr\u00e9s Iniesta]] scored in extra time. This final also became [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]]'s last match in professional football.\n\nFrom August to September 2011, the team was ranked number 1 in the [[FIFA World Rankings]], thus becoming the second national football team, after Spain, to top the rankings without previously winning a World Cup.

Her keel was laid down on 14 June 1918 by the [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation]] in [[San Francisco, California]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 27 February 1919 sponsored by Miss Louise C. Bailey, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 17 August 1922 with Lieutenant Edwin T. Short in command.<ref>{{cite news |title=Santa Rosan On Way From Honolulu |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/82434412/ |agency=Oakland Tribune |date=June 16, 1922}}</ref>\n\n==Service history==\nEngaged in trials as improved engines were developed for her class, ''S-35'' was ordered to [[New London, Connecticut]], in September, for alterations by the prime contractor, the [[Electric Boat]] Company. Decommissioned and delivered to that company on 25 October, she was accepted and recommissioned on 7 May 1923. Exercises along the East Coast and in the [[Caribbean Sea]] followed and, in early August, she arrived at [[San Diego, California]], her home port until 1925. Then transferred to the [[Asiatic Fleet]], she departed from [[San Francisco, California]], in mid-April and arrived at the Submarine Base, [[Cavite]], [[Philippine Islands]], on 12 July.\n\n''S-35'' operated in Philippine waters, conducting patrols and participating in type, division, and fleet exercises until the spring of 1926. Then she sailed, with her division, for the [[China]] coast. Through the summer and into the fall, she conducted similar operations out of [[Qingdao|Tsingtao]]; and, in November she returned to the Philippines where, after overhaul, she resumed local operations.\n\nShe maintained a similar schedule of winter operations in the Philippines and summer deployments in Chinese waters through 1931. On 2 May 1932, she moved east, instead of north, and at the end of the month, arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]] where she joined the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] and commenced a schedule of exercises, overhauls, and fleet problems which took her into the 1940s.\n\nIn 1934, she won the [[Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award]] for the highest merit in battle torpedo practice of submarines.\n \nIn April 1941, she was transferred to San Diego, California, and, for the remaining months of peace, she provided services for the West Coast Sound School.\n\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''S-35'' added defensive patrol work to her duties; and, in January 1942, she moved north to [[Mare Island]] for limited modernization and overhaul.  In late March, she continued northward and, in early April, arrived at the newly established submarine base at [[Dutch Harbor]].\n\n=== First War Patrol ===\nOn 12 April, she cleared Dutch Harbor and moved toward the [[Kuril Islands]] for her first war patrol. On 21  and 22 April, snow and fog covered her approach to [[Paramushiro]] and [[Onekotan Strait]]. On 23 April, she sighted and was sighted by, a large enemy submarine on the surface. Both submarines submerged. Explosions were felt in ''S-35''. The blasts forced her down further than expected, but she regained control at 220&nbsp;feet, returned to her intended depth; and maneuvered out of the immediate area.\n\nThe weather cleared on 24 April, and Paramushiro was sighted for the first time. Two days later, however, the [[United States S class submarine|S-boat]] was en route to her secondary station north of [[Attu Island|Attu]].  On arrival on 27 April, a ship's cook was discovered to have [[mumps]] and a course was set for Dutch Harbor. Isolation was impossible, and half the crew had not had the [[disease]].\n\nThree days later, ''S-35'' returned to her [[Unalaska]] base.  The crew received medical attention, the boat was scrubbed down and refitted; and requests for modern equipment, including [[sonar]] and [[radar]], were made.\n\n=== Second War Patrol ===\nToward the end of May, the submarine was ready for sea; and, on 28 April, she moved west in response to intelligence reports of a Japanese invasion force bound for the western [[Aleutian Islands]].\n\nOn station by 30 April, she patrolled on the surface with no contacts, through 2 June. On the morning of 3 June, word of the bombing of Dutch Harbor was received. Aerial contacts, both friendly and enemy became frequent; but the submarine was not attacked.\n\nOn 11 June, she was ordered back to Dutch Harbor to replenish; thence, she was routed to the western part of the archipelago for offensive operations near [[Kiska]] which had been taken by the Japanese. On 14 June, she approached the island and patrolled between there and [[Segula Island|Segula]] until 23 June.  She then participated in the search for sister ship {{USS|S-27|SS-132|2}}, which had run aground on [[Amchitka Island]]; returned to her patrol area late on 25 June; and, on 29 June, returned to Dutch Harbor. The thick fog which had shielded the Japanese force as it crossed the [[Bering Sea]] had remained over the Aleutians during her patrol, impairing visibility and hindering her offensive efforts.\n\n=== Third War Patrol ===\nOn 14 July, ''S-35'' got underway again and, through the end of the month, patrolled the Japanese supply lanes to Kiska. She then headed back toward Dutch Harbor, but was diverted north and west of the island to provide weather reporting services to the force scheduled to bombard Kiska on 7 August. After the raid, she returned to Dutch Harbor, thence proceeded to San Diego, where for six weeks she underwent overhaul and provided services to the sound school.\n\n=== Fourth War Patrol ===\nOn 20 October, she returned to Unalaska; and, on 26 October, she cleared the harbor for her fourth war patrol.  From then until her return on 22 November, she battled heavy seas, storms, and problems arising from her inadequate and outmoded equipment as she hunted the [[Paramushiro]]-[[Attu Island|Attu]]-[[Kiska]] convoy routes. On 25 November, she returned to Dutch Harbor.\n\n=== Fifth War Patrol ===\n\nCold weather added icing to the climatic hazards of the northern [[Pacific Ocean]]; but, on 11 December, ''S-35'' headed out of Dutch Harbor again. On 15 December, she commenced operations to intercept enemy traffic to Attu and Kiska; but, on 17 December, a case of acute [[appendicitis]] forced her to [[Adak, Alaska]], where she was to transfer the sick man to [[seaplane tender]] {{USS|Gillis|AVD-12|2}} for treatment. On 18 December, she approached the rendezvous point but was sighted by enemy planes. On the morning of 19 December, she completed the transfer; then resumed patrol east of Kiska. On the afternoon of 21 December, she ran into a storm while surfaced off Amchitka; and, by early evening, waves were smashing over the bridge and cascading into the control room. The conning tower hatch was ordered shut. Almost simultaneously, another huge wave crashed over the bridge, flinging the captain, Lieutenant H. S.  Monroe, into the hatch. Injured, Monroe retired to his quarters, only to be roused a short time later, about 18:30, by cries of \"fire\" in the control room.\n\nElectric arcs and blue flames spewed out of the main power cables coming from the forward battery. Smoke filled the room; and water, which had caused the fire by soaking cables and causing a short, rose in the control room bilges. The fire was extinguished in the control room but immediately broke out in the forward battery. Fire extinguishers had no effect. The forward two compartments were abandoned and the battery was secured. Fire again broke out in the control room; and, as in the forward battery, extinguishers were of little help. Smoke filled the control room. The engines were stopped. The room was abandoned and sealed. Short circuits spread. Electrical equipment was disabled. A hole was burned in the top of the Number Two main ballast tank and lines from two air banks were severed.\n\nAt about 18:55, unsuccessful attempts to reenter the control room, using escape lungs, were made. Shortly thereafter, two volunteers, using oxygen charged lungs, entered the room; flooded the magazines; partially blew the Number Three main ballast tank to gain more freeboard; and shut the auxiliary induction to seal the forward battery.\n\nThe fight to save the submarine continued. The engines were started again; a fire extinguisher watch was set over the section of cable still arcing; and a bucket brigade was organized to assist in keeping down the water level. By 20:00, all extinguishers had been emptied. But ''S-35'', under manual control, was moving east.\n\nThe morning of 21 December brought new fires. Twice, at 07:00 and at 11:00, eruptions forced the crew to the bridge.  But the same flares apparently contributed to the fire's burning itself out. After the second, the forward battery was sufficiently discharged and the cables sufficiently ruptured to prevent further fire in the control room. Smoke from the forward battery compartment, however, continued to be a problem until she entered [[Kuluk Bay]] and the battery was disconnected. Arriving at noon on 24 December, the boat was ventilated; medical help was obtained; four men were hospitalized; and mattresses, bedding, and clothing were dried.\n\nOn 29 December, ''S-35'' made her way, under escort, into Dutch Harbor. Usable equipment was removed for installation in other S-boats, and, on 14 January 1943 she began the long trip to the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] for repairs. Arriving at [[Bremerton, Washington]] on 29 January, repairs took her into the spring.  From 20&ndash;31 May, she conducted post repair trials; and, on 3 June, she moved north again.\n\nFor heroism and devotion to duty in saving the submarine and her crew Lieutenant Commander Stone and [[Chief Petty Officer (United States)|Chief Electrician's Mate]] Frederick H. Barbero were awarded the [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]] for non-combat heroism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Valor awards for Frederick H.

Despite numerous material casualties, which slowed her to an average speed of a little more than 5&nbsp;knots, she continued toward the [[Kuril Islands]] and arrived in her patrol area on 25 June. On 26 June, she transited [[Onekotan Strait]]; and, on 27 June, she sighted her first target of the patrol, a large Japanese freighter. The target, however, soon outdistanced the [[World War I]]-design submarine and disappeared into the ever-present fog.\n\nMaterial defects continued to cause problems. Her starboard engine soon went out of commission; and, as repair work was started, a freighter and a [[destroyer]] were sighted approaching on a course which would bring them over her position. A half hour later, the two enemy ships passed overhead, one to port, the other to starboard. Repair work was then resumed.\n\nBy dawn of 29 June, the engine was again operable; and, on 30 June, ''S-35'' shifted north to [[Araido]], thence proceeded to the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], whence she moved back down the coast and covered [[Shimushu Strait]], [[Paramushiro Strait]], and [[Araido Strait]].\n\nOn 1 July, she found a clear area in the fog and sighted a fishing tender awaiting the return of its trawlers. At 18:02, she fired two [[torpedo]]es at ten-second intervals; watched the first hit; and saw the second porpoising haphazardly through the water toward the target.  At 18:06, she fired a third torpedo and watched the target explode and list heavily to starboard. By 18:21, the 5430-ton ''Banshu Maru Number Seven'' had disappeared, but others remained in the area where she had been. ''S-35'' reloaded and turned to firing position; but, by 18:25, the new targets had receded into the fog. Five minutes later, fast screws were heard; and the submarine began evasive tactics and cleared the area.\n\nOn 2 July, ''S-35'' received orders to shift to the convoy routes leading to southern Paramushiro. Arriving on 4 July, she remained through 16 July. Clear weather arrived with dawn of the last day, and, that afternoon, the submarine sighted a destroyer patrolling in concert, apparently, with a [[flying boat]]. As the flying boat disappeared toward its base, ''S-35'' prepared to attack. At 15:41, she began her approach on the destroyer. At about 15:42, the destroyer sighted her. She went deep. For the remainder of the day and well into the night, the two adversaries maneuvered for position: ''S-35'' evading [[depth charge]]s and attempting to gain a favorable firing position; the destroyer keeping the submarine on evasive tactics and attempting to pinpoint her location and deliver a decisive depth charge. Success went to neither side.\n\nOn the morning of 17 July, ''S-35'' cleared the area and headed back toward the Aleutians. On 21 July, she arrived at Attu; and, on 25 July, she moored in Dutch Harbor.  During the patrol, she had had only five clear days; four had been partially clear, the remainder had been foggy with poor to very poor visibility.\n\n=== Seventh War Patrol ===\nOn 6 August, ''S-35'' began her seventh war patrol. Standing out of [[Dutch Harbor]], she made for [[Attu Island|Attu]], topped off in [[Massacre Bay (Alaska)|Massacre Bay]]; then proceeded to her patrol area. On 11 August, she sighted a ship, but was unable to close. On 19 August, cracks developed in the port engine crankshaft and couplings; and she turned back for Dutch Harbor. Overhaul followed her return; and on 26 November, she was again ready to hunt in the Kurils. Underway that day, she arrived on station on 8 December, and for the next ten days, encountered heavy seas, snow, and \"mild icing\" as she searched waters off [[Onekotan]] and in the [[S\u014dya Subprefecture|S\u014dya]]-[[Araido]] and\n[[Omintao]]-[[Musashi Province|Mushashi]]-[[Kashiwabara]] shipping lanes. On 19 December, she shifted north; reconnoitered the [[Kamchatka peninsula]]; then, headed home. En route, engineering defects again became critical, and almost 20 hours were spent in repairs. On 25 December, she arrived at Attu; and, on 30 December, she entered Dutch Harbor to complete her last war patrol.\n\n== Retirement ==\n[[Fleet submarine]]s now replaced the World War I-designed types. The Aleutian [[United States S class submarine|S-boat]]s, as with those operating in other areas, were reassigned to training duty or designated for inactivation. ''S-35'' was assigned to Pearl Harbor where she arrived in mid-February 1944 and immediately commenced training operations. In the spring, she was ordered to the [[Marshall Islands]]. Through the summer, she provided training services out of [[Majuro]] and [[Eniwetok]], then returned to [[Pearl Harbor]]. In January 1945, she proceeded to San Diego for inspection and repairs, and, in February, she returned to [[Oahu]] for use as a damage control school ship.  Decommissioned on 19 March 1945, she served as a school ship and then as a target ship. Her hulk was sunk by torpedo fire on 4 April 1946.\n\n''S-35'' was awarded one [[battle star]] for her service during [[World War II]].\n\n(insert photo of S-35 crew at decommissioning)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/s/s-35.html}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.pigboats.com/ww2/s35.html  Kill Record: USS ''S-35'']\n\n{{United_States_S_class_submarine}}\n{{1946 shipwrecks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:S-35}}\n[[Category:United States S-class submarines]]\n[[Category:World War II submarines of the United States]]\n[[Category:Ships built in San Francisco]]\n[[Category:1919 ships]]\n[[Category:Ships sunk as targets]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in 1946]]\n", "text_old": "{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image= USS S-35 (SS-140).jpg\n|Ship caption=USS ''S-35'' off [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]], in November 1923.\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship country=United States\n|Ship flag= {{USN flag|1945}}\n|Ship name= USS ''S-35''\n|Ship namesake=\n|Ship ordered=  \n|Ship builder= [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation]]\n|Ship laid down= 14 June 1918\n|Ship launched= 27 February 1919\n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship commissioned= 17 August 1922\n|Ship decommissioned= 19 March 1945\n|Ship in service=\n|Ship out of service=\n|Ship struck= \n|Ship reinstated=\n|Ship homeport=\n|Ship motto=  \n|Ship nickname=\n|Ship honours=\n|Ship fate=Sunk as a target, 4 April 1946\n|Ship status=\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class= [[United States S-class submarine|S-class]] [[submarine]]\n|Ship displacement=*{{convert|854|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} surfaced\n*{{convert|1062|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} submerged\n|Ship length= {{convert|219|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} \n|Ship beam= {{convert|20|ft|8|in|m|abbr=on}} \n|Ship draft= {{convert|15|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}\n|Ship propulsion=\n|Ship speed=*{{convert|14.5|kn|mph km/h|lk=in}} surfaced\n*{{convert|11|kn|mph km/h}} submerged\n|Ship range=  \n|Ship test depth=\n|Ship complement=42 officers and men\n|Ship sensors=\n|Ship EW=\n|Ship armament=*1 \u00d7 [[4\"/50 caliber gun|{{convert|4|in|mm|abbr=on}}]]/50 [[deck gun]]\n*4 \u00d7 [[American 21 inch torpedo|21 inch (533 mm)]] [[torpedo tube]]s\n|Ship armor=\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n{{Infobox service record\n|is_ship=yes\n|label= \n|partof=\n|codes=\n|commanders=\n|operations=[[World War II]]\n|victories=\n|awards=1 [[battle star]]\n}}\n|}\n'''USS ''S-35'' (SS-140)''' was an [[United States S-class submarine|S-class submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]].  Her keel was laid down on 14 June 1918 by the [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation]] in [[San Francisco, California]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 27 February 1919 sponsored by Miss Louise C. Bailey, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 17 August 1922 with Lieutenant T. E. Short in command.\n\n==Service history==\nEngaged in trials as improved engines were developed for her class, ''S-35'' was ordered to [[New London, Connecticut]], in September, for alterations by the prime contractor, the [[Electric Boat]] Company. Decommissioned and delivered to that company on 25 October, she was accepted and recommissioned on 7 May 1923. Exercises along the East Coast and in the [[Caribbean Sea]] followed and, in early August, she arrived at [[San Diego, California]], her home port until 1925. Then transferred to the [[Asiatic Fleet]], she departed from [[San Francisco, California]], in mid-April and arrived at the Submarine Base, [[Cavite]], [[Philippine Islands]], on 12 July.\n\n''S-35'' operated in Philippine waters, conducting patrols and participating in type, division, and fleet exercises until the spring of 1926. Then she sailed, with her division, for the [[China]] coast. Through the summer and into the fall, she conducted similar operations out of [[Qingdao|Tsingtao]]; and, in November she returned to the Philippines where, after overhaul, she resumed local operations.\n\nShe maintained a similar schedule of winter operations in the Philippines and summer deployments in Chinese waters through 1931. On 2 May 1932, she moved east, instead of north, and at the end of the month, arrived at [[Pearl Harbor]] where she joined the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] and commenced a schedule of exercises, overhauls, and fleet problems which took her into the 1940s.\n\nIn 1934, she won the [[Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award]] for the highest merit in battle torpedo practice of submarines.\n \nIn April 1941, she was transferred to San Diego, California, and, for the remaining months of peace, she provided services for the West Coast Sound School.\n\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''S-35'' added defensive patrol work to her duties; and, in January 1942, she moved north to [[Mare Island]] for limited modernization and overhaul.  In late March, she continued northward and, in early April, arrived at the newly established submarine base at [[Dutch Harbor]].\n\n=== First War Patrol ===\nOn 12 April, she cleared Dutch Harbor and moved toward the [[Kuril Islands]] for her first war patrol. On 21  and 22 April, snow and fog covered her approach to [[Paramushiro]] and [[Onekotan Strait]]. On 23 April, she sighted and was sighted by, a large enemy submarine on the surface. Both submarines submerged. Explosions were felt in ''S-35''. The blasts forced her down further than expected, but she regained control at 220&nbsp;feet, returned to her intended depth; and maneuvered out of the immediate area.\n\nThe weather cleared on 24 April, and Paramushiro was sighted for the first time. Two days later, however, the [[United States S class submarine|S-boat]] was en route to her secondary station north of [[Attu Island|Attu]].  On arrival on 27 April, a ship's cook was discovered to have [[mumps]] and a course was set for Dutch Harbor. Isolation was impossible, and half the crew had not had the [[disease]].\n\nThree days later, ''S-35'' returned to her [[Unalaska]] base.  The crew received medical attention, the boat was scrubbed down and refitted; and requests for modern equipment, including [[sonar]] and [[radar]], were made.\n\n=== Second War Patrol ===\nToward the end of May, the submarine was ready for sea; and, on 28 April, she moved west in response to intelligence reports of a Japanese invasion force bound for the western [[Aleutian Islands]].\n\nOn station by 30 April, she patrolled on the surface with no contacts, through 2 June. On the morning of 3 June, word of the bombing of Dutch Harbor was received. Aerial contacts, both friendly and enemy became frequent; but the submarine was not attacked.\n\nOn 11 June, she was ordered back to Dutch Harbor to replenish; thence, she was routed to the western part of the archipelago for offensive operations near [[Kiska]] which had been taken by the Japanese. On 14 June, she approached the island and patrolled between there and [[Segula Island|Segula]] until 23 June.  She then participated in the search for sister ship {{USS|S-27|SS-132|2}}, which had run aground on [[Amchitka Island]]; returned to her patrol area late on 25 June; and, on 29 June, returned to Dutch Harbor. The thick fog which had shielded the Japanese force as it crossed the [[Bering Sea]] had remained over the Aleutians during her patrol, impairing visibility and hindering her offensive efforts.\n\n=== Third War Patrol ===\nOn 14 July, ''S-35'' got underway again and, through the end of the month, patrolled the Japanese supply lanes to Kiska. She then headed back toward Dutch Harbor, but was diverted north and west of the island to provide weather reporting services to the force scheduled to bombard Kiska on 7 August. After the raid, she returned to Dutch Harbor, thence proceeded to San Diego, where for six weeks she underwent overhaul and provided services to the sound school.\n\n=== Fourth War Patrol ===\nOn 20 October, she returned to Unalaska; and, on 26 October, she cleared the harbor for her fourth war patrol.  From then until her return on 22 November, she battled heavy seas, storms, and problems arising from her inadequate and outmoded equipment as she hunted the [[Paramushiro]]-[[Attu Island|Attu]]-[[Kiska]] convoy routes. On 25 November, she returned to Dutch Harbor.\n\n=== Fifth War Patrol ===\n\nCold weather added icing to the climatic hazards of the northern [[Pacific Ocean]]; but, on 11 December, ''S-35'' headed out of Dutch Harbor again. On 15 December, she commenced operations to intercept enemy traffic to Attu and Kiska; but, on 17 December, a case of acute [[appendicitis]] forced her to [[Adak, Alaska]], where she was to transfer the sick man to [[seaplane tender]] {{USS|Gillis|AVD-12|2}} for treatment. On 18 December, she approached the rendezvous point but was sighted by enemy planes. On the morning of 19 December, she completed the transfer; then resumed patrol east of Kiska. On the afternoon of 21 December, she ran into a storm while surfaced off Amchitka; and, by early evening, waves were smashing over the bridge and cascading into the control room. The conning tower hatch was ordered shut. Almost simultaneously, another huge wave crashed over the bridge, flinging the captain, Lieutenant H. S.  Monroe, into the hatch. Injured, Monroe retired to his quarters, only to be roused a short time later, about 18:30, by cries of \"fire\" in the control room.\n\nElectric arcs and blue flames spewed out of the main power cables coming from the forward battery. Smoke filled the room; and water, which had caused the fire by soaking cables and causing a short, rose in the control room bilges. The fire was extinguished in the control room but immediately broke out in the forward battery. Fire extinguishers had no effect. The forward two compartments were abandoned and the battery was secured. Fire again broke out in the control room; and, as in the forward battery, extinguishers were of little help. Smoke filled the control room. The engines were stopped. The room was abandoned and sealed. Short circuits spread. Electrical equipment was disabled. A hole was burned in the top of the Number Two main ballast tank and lines from two air banks were severed.\n\nAt about 18:55, unsuccessful attempts to reenter the control room, using escape lungs, were made. Shortly thereafter, two volunteers, using oxygen charged lungs, entered the room; flooded the magazines; partially blew the Number Three main ballast tank to gain more freeboard; and shut the auxiliary induction to seal the forward battery.\n\nThe fight to save the submarine continued. The engines were started again; a fire extinguisher watch was set over the section of cable still arcing; and a bucket brigade was organized to assist in keeping down the water level. By 20:00, all extinguishers had been emptied. But ''S-35'', under manual control, was moving east.\n\nThe morning of 21 December brought new fires. Twice, at 07:00 and at 11:00, eruptions forced the crew to the bridge.  But the same flares apparently contributed to the fire's burning itself out. After the second, the forward battery was sufficiently discharged and the cables sufficiently ruptured to prevent further fire in the control room. Smoke from the forward battery compartment, however, continued to be a problem until she entered [[Kuluk Bay]] and the battery was disconnected. Arriving at noon on 24 December, the boat was ventilated; medical help was obtained; four men were hospitalized; and mattresses, bedding, and clothing were dried.\n\nOn 29 December, ''S-35'' made her way, under escort, into Dutch Harbor. Usable equipment was removed for installation in other S-boats, and, on 14 January 1943 she began the long trip to the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] for repairs. Arriving at [[Bremerton, Washington]] on 29 January, repairs took her into the spring.  From 20&ndash;31 May, she conducted post repair trials; and, on 3 June, she moved north again.\n\nFor heroism and devotion to duty in saving the submarine and her crew Lieutenant Commander Stone and [[Chief Petty Officer (United States)|Chief Electrician's Mate]] Frederick H. Barbero were awarded the [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]] for non-combat heroism.<ref>{{cite web|title=Valor awards for Frederick H.

Despite numerous material casualties, which slowed her to an average speed of a little more than 5&nbsp;knots, she continued toward the [[Kuril Islands]] and arrived in her patrol area on 25 June. On 26 June, she transited [[Onekotan Strait]]; and, on 27 June, she sighted her first target of the patrol, a large Japanese freighter. The target, however, soon outdistanced the [[World War I]]-design submarine and disappeared into the ever-present fog.\n\nMaterial defects continued to cause problems. Her starboard engine soon went out of commission; and, as repair work was started, a freighter and a [[destroyer]] were sighted approaching on a course which would bring them over her position. A half hour later, the two enemy ships passed overhead, one to port, the other to starboard. Repair work was then resumed.\n\nBy dawn of 29 June, the engine was again operable; and, on 30 June, ''S-35'' shifted north to [[Araido]], thence proceeded to the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]], whence she moved back down the coast and covered [[Shimushu Strait]], [[Paramushiro Strait]], and [[Araido Strait]].\n\nOn 1 July, she found a clear area in the fog and sighted a fishing tender awaiting the return of its trawlers. At 18:02, she fired two [[torpedo]]es at ten-second intervals; watched the first hit; and saw the second porpoising haphazardly through the water toward the target.  At 18:06, she fired a third torpedo and watched the target explode and list heavily to starboard. By 18:21, the 5430-ton ''Banshu Maru Number Seven'' had disappeared, but others remained in the area where she had been. ''S-35'' reloaded and turned to firing position; but, by 18:25, the new targets had receded into the fog. Five minutes later, fast screws were heard; and the submarine began evasive tactics and cleared the area.\n\nOn 2 July, ''S-35'' received orders to shift to the convoy routes leading to southern Paramushiro. Arriving on 4 July, she remained through 16 July. Clear weather arrived with dawn of the last day, and, that afternoon, the submarine sighted a destroyer patrolling in concert, apparently, with a [[flying boat]]. As the flying boat disappeared toward its base, ''S-35'' prepared to attack. At 15:41, she began her approach on the destroyer. At about 15:42, the destroyer sighted her. She went deep. For the remainder of the day and well into the night, the two adversaries maneuvered for position: ''S-35'' evading [[depth charge]]s and attempting to gain a favorable firing position; the destroyer keeping the submarine on evasive tactics and attempting to pinpoint her location and deliver a decisive depth charge. Success went to neither side.\n\nOn the morning of 17 July, ''S-35'' cleared the area and headed back toward the Aleutians. On 21 July, she arrived at Attu; and, on 25 July, she moored in Dutch Harbor.  During the patrol, she had had only five clear days; four had been partially clear, the remainder had been foggy with poor to very poor visibility.\n\n=== Seventh War Patrol ===\nOn 6 August, ''S-35'' began her seventh war patrol. Standing out of [[Dutch Harbor]], she made for [[Attu Island|Attu]], topped off in [[Massacre Bay (Alaska)|Massacre Bay]]; then proceeded to her patrol area. On 11 August, she sighted a ship, but was unable to close. On 19 August, cracks developed in the port engine crankshaft and couplings; and she turned back for Dutch Harbor. Overhaul followed her return; and on 26 November, she was again ready to hunt in the Kurils. Underway that day, she arrived on station on 8 December, and for the next ten days, encountered heavy seas, snow, and \"mild icing\" as she searched waters off [[Onekotan]] and in the [[S\u014dya Subprefecture|S\u014dya]]-[[Araido]] and\n[[Omintao]]-[[Musashi Province|Mushashi]]-[[Kashiwabara]] shipping lanes. On 19 December, she shifted north; reconnoitered the [[Kamchatka peninsula]]; then, headed home. En route, engineering defects again became critical, and almost 20 hours were spent in repairs. On 25 December, she arrived at Attu; and, on 30 December, she entered Dutch Harbor to complete her last war patrol.\n\n== Retirement ==\n[[Fleet submarine]]s now replaced the World War I-designed types. The Aleutian [[United States S class submarine|S-boat]]s, as with those operating in other areas, were reassigned to training duty or designated for inactivation.
