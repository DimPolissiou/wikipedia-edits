His later works were more [[abstract art|abstract]]. His key influence related to bold use of colour and a clear love of experimentation with both depth and [[Lightness (color)|tone]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nRobert Delaunay was born in [[Paris]], the son of George Delaunay and [[Count]]ess Berthe F\u00e9licie de Rose. While he was a child, Delaunay's parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother's sister Marie and her husband Charles Damour, in La Ronch\u00e8re near [[Bourges]]. When he failed his final exam and said he wanted to become a painter, his uncle in 1902 sent him to Ronsin's [[atelier]] to study [[Decorative Arts]] in the [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] district of Paris.<ref>[[#hd95|D\u00fcchting]]: p7</ref> At age 19, he left Ronsin to focus entirely on painting and contributed six works to the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] in 1904.<ref name=kh>Robert Delaunay \u2013 Sonia Delaunay, 1999, {{ISBN|3-7701-5216-6}}</ref>\n\nHe traveled to [[Brittany]], where he was influenced by the [[Pont-Aven School|group of Pont-Aven]]; and, in 1906, he contributed works he painted in Brittany to the 22nd Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, where he met [[Henri Rousseau]].<ref name=kh/>\n\nDelaunay formed a close friendship at this time with [[Jean Metzinger]], with whom he shared an [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] at a [[Art gallery|gallery]] run by Berthe Weill early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by the [[art critic]] [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in 1907 as [[Divisionism|Divisionists]] who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html|title=History of Art: Jean Metzinger|website=www.all-art.org}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Delaunay, c.1906, Paysage au disque solaire, oil on canvas, 54 x 46 cm, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|Robert Delaunay, ''Paysage au disque'', 1906\u201307, oil on canvas, 55 x 46 cm, Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne (MNAM), Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris]]\nRobert Herbert writes: \"Metzinger's [[Neo-Impressionist]] period was somewhat longer than that of his close friend Delaunay... The height of his Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, when he and Delaunay did portraits of each other (Art market, London, and Museum of Fine Arts, Houston) in prominent rectangles of pigment.

[[Piet Mondrian]] developed a similar mosaic-like Divisionist technique circa 1909. The [[Futurists]] later (1909\u20131916) would incorporate the style, under the influence of [[Gino Severini]]'s Parisian works (from 1907 onward), into their dynamic paintings and sculpture.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\n[[File:Delaunay ChampDeMars.jpg|thumb|''Champs de Mars, La Tour rouge'', 1911, [[Art Institute of Chicago]].]]\n[[File:Robert Delaunay - Simultaneous Contrasts-Sun and Moon - 1912.jpg|thumb|right|''Simultaneous Contrasts: Sun and Moon'', 1912\u201313, oil on canvas, [[Museum of Modern Art]]]]\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nIn the prime of his career he painted a number of series that included: the ''Saint-S\u00e9vrin'' series (1909\u201310); the ''City'' series (1909\u20131911); the [[Eiffel Tower (Delaunay series)|''Eiffel Tower'' series]] (1909\u20131912); the ''City of Paris'' series (1911\u201312); the ''Window'' series (1912\u20131914); the ''Cardiff Team'' series (1913); the ''Circular Forms'' series (1913); and ''The First Disk'' (1913).\n\nDelaunay is most closely identified with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].  From 1912 to 1914, he painted nonfigurative paintings based on the optical characteristics of brilliant colors that were so dynamic they would function as the form. His theories are mostly concerned with color and light and influenced many, including [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]], [[Morgan Russell]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Der Blaue Reiter]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Lyonel Feininger]]. [[Apollinaire]] was strongly influenced by Delaunay's theories of color and often quoted from them to explain Orphism. Delaunay's fixations with color as the expressive and structural means were sustained by his study of color.\n\nHis writings on color, which were influenced by scientists and theoreticians, are intuitive and can sometimes be random statements based on the belief that color is a thing in itself, with its own powers of expression and form. He believes painting is a purely visual art that depends on intellectual elements, and perception is in the impact of colored light on the eye. The contrasts and harmonies of color produce in the eye simultaneous movements and correspond to movement in nature. Vision becomes the subject of painting.\n\nHis early paintings are deeply rooted in [[Neoimpressionism]]. ''Night Scene'', for example, has vigorous activity, with the use of lively brushstrokes in bright colors against a dark background, not defining solid objects but the areas that surround them.\n\nThe spectral colors of Neoimpressionism were later abandoned. The ''Eiffel Tower'' series represented the fragmentation of solid objects and their merging with space. Influences in this series were C\u00e9zanne, Analytical Cubism, and Futurism. In the ''Eiffel Tower'' the interpenetration of tangible objects and surrounding space is accompanied by the intense movement of geometric planes that are more dynamic than the static equilibrium of Cubist forms.\n\nIn 1908, after a term in the military working as a regimental librarian, he met [[Sonia Terk]]; at the time she was married to a German art dealer whom she would soon divorce. In 1909, Delaunay began to paint a series of studies of the city of Paris and the [[Eiffel Tower]], the [[Eiffel Tower (Delaunay series)|''Eiffel Tower'' series]].\n\nThe following year, he married Terk, and the couple settled in a studio apartment in Paris, where their son [[Charles Delaunay|Charles]] was born in January 1911. The same year, at the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Delaunay joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of artists. Delaunay was also successful in Germany, Switzerland, and Russia. He participated in the first Blanc Reiter exhibition in Munich and sold four works. Delaunay's paintings encouraged an enthusiastic response with Blaue Reiter. The Blaue Reiter connections led to Erwin Ritter von Busse's article \"Robert Delaunay\u2019s Methods of Compositions\" which appeared in the 1912 ''Blaue Reiter Almanac''. Delaunay would go to exhibit in February of that year, in the second Blaue Reiter exhibition in Munich and Valet de Carrean in Moscow.\n\n[[Image:Robert Delaunay, 1913, Premier Disque, 134 cm, 52.7 inches, Private collection.jpg|thumb|200px|''Le Premier Disque'', (1912\u20131913).

On March 13 his first major exhibition in Paris closed after two weeks at the [[Galerie Barbazanges]]. The exhibition showed forty-six works from his early Impressionist works to his Cubist Eiffel Tower painting from 1909\u20131911.\nArt Critic Guillaume Apollinaire praised those works of the exhibition and proclaimed Delaunay as \"an artist who has a monumental vision of the world.\"\n\nIn the March 23, 1912, issue of ''L'Assiette au Beurre'', The first published suggestion that Delaunay had broken with this group of Cubists appeared, in James Burkley's review of that year's Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants. \nBurkley wrote, \"The Cubists, who occupy only a room, have multiplied. Their leaders, Picasso and Braque, have not participated in their grouping, and Delaunay, commonly labeled a Cubist, has wished to isolate himself and declare that he has nothing in common with Metzinger or Le Fauconnier.\"\n\nWith [[Apollinaire]], Delaunay traveled to [[Berlin]] in January 1913 for an exhibition of his work at [[Der Sturm|Galerie Der Sturm]].

His later works were more [[abstract art|abstract]]. His key influence related to bold use of colour and a clear love of experimentation with both depth and [[Lightness (color)|tone]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nRobert Delaunay was born in [[Paris]], the son of George Delaunay and [[Count]]ess Berthe F\u00e9licie de Rose. While he was a child, Delaunay's parents divorced, and he was raised by his mother's sister Marie and her husband Charles Damour, in La Ronch\u00e8re near [[Bourges]]. When he failed his final exam and said he wanted to become a painter, his uncle in 1902 sent him to Ronsin's [[atelier]] to study [[Decorative Arts]] in the [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] district of Paris.<ref>[[#hd95|D\u00fcchting]]: p7</ref> At age 19, he left Ronsin to focus entirely on painting and contributed six works to the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] in 1904.<ref name=kh>Robert Delaunay \u2013 Sonia Delaunay, 1999, {{ISBN|3-7701-5216-6}}</ref>\n\nHe traveled to [[Brittany]], where he was influenced by the [[Pont-Aven School|group of Pont-Aven]]; and, in 1906, he contributed works he painted in Brittany to the 22nd Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants, where he met [[Henri Rousseau]].<ref name=kh/>\n\nDelaunay formed a close friendship at this time with [[Jean Metzinger]], with whom he shared an [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] at a [[Art gallery|gallery]] run by Berthe Weill early in 1907. The two of them were singled out by the [[art critic]] [[Louis Vauxcelles]] in 1907 as [[Divisionism|Divisionists]] who used large, mosaic-like 'cubes' to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html|title=History of Art: Jean Metzinger|website=www.all-art.org}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Delaunay, c.1906, Paysage au disque solaire, oil on canvas, 54 x 46 cm, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|Robert Delaunay, ''Paysage au disque'', 1906\u201307, oil on canvas, 55 x 46 cm, Mus\u00e9e national d'art moderne (MNAM), Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris]]\nRobert Herbert writes: \"Metzinger's [[Neo-Impressionist]] period was somewhat longer than that of his close friend Delaunay...

[[Piet Mondrian]] developed a similar mosaic-like Divisionist technique circa 1909. The [[Futurists]] later (1909\u20131916) would incorporate the style, under the influence of [[Gino Severini]]'s Parisian works (from 1907 onward), into their dynamic paintings and sculpture.<ref name=\"Robert Herbert\" />\n\n[[File:Delaunay ChampDeMars.jpg|thumb|''Champs de Mars, La Tour rouge'', 1911, [[Art Institute of Chicago]].]]\n[[File:Robert Delaunay - Simultaneous Contrasts-Sun and Moon - 1912.jpg|thumb|right|''Simultaneous Contrasts: Sun and Moon'', 1912\u201313, oil on canvas, [[Museum of Modern Art]]]]\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nIn the prime of his career he painted a number of series that included: the ''Saint-S\u00e9vrin'' series (1909\u201310); the ''City'' series (1909\u20131911); the [[Eiffel Tower (Delaunay series)|''Eiffel Tower'' series]] (1909\u20131912); the ''City of Paris'' series (1911\u201312); the ''Window'' series (1912\u20131914); the ''Cardiff Team'' series (1913); the ''Circular Forms'' series (1913); and ''The First Disk'' (1913).\n\nDelaunay is most closely identified with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].  From 1912 to 1914, he painted nonfigurative paintings based on the optical characteristics of brilliant colors that were so dynamic they would function as the form. His theories are mostly concerned with color and light and influenced many, including [[Stanton Macdonald-Wright]], [[Morgan Russell]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Der Blaue Reiter]], [[August Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Paul Klee]], and [[Lyonel Feininger]]. [[Apollinaire]] was strongly influenced by Delaunay's theories of color and often quoted from them to explain Orphism. Delaunay's fixations with color as the expressive and structural means were sustained by his study of color.\n\nHis writings on color, which were influenced by scientists and theoreticians, are intuitive and can sometimes be random statements based on the belief that color is a thing in itself, with its own powers of expression and form. He believes painting is a purely visual art that depends on intellectual elements, and perception is in the impact of colored light on the eye. The contrasts and harmonies of color produce in the eye simultaneous movements and correspond to movement in nature. Vision becomes the subject of painting.\n\nHis early paintings are deeply rooted in [[Neoimpressionism]]. ''Night Scene'', for example, has vigorous activity, with the use of lively brushstrokes in bright colors against a dark background, not defining solid objects but the areas that surround them.\n\nThe spectral colors of Neoimpressionism were later abandoned. The ''Eiffel Tower'' series represented the fragmentation of solid objects and their merging with space. Influences in this series were C\u00e9zanne, Analytical Cubism, and Futurism. In the ''Eiffel Tower'' the interpenetration of tangible objects and surrounding space is accompanied by the intense movement of geometric planes that are more dynamic than the static equilibrium of Cubist forms.\n\nIn 1908, after a term in the military working as a regimental librarian, he met [[Sonia Terk]]; at the time she was married to a German art dealer whom she would soon divorce. In 1909, Delaunay began to paint a series of studies of the city of Paris and the [[Eiffel Tower]], the [[Eiffel Tower (Delaunay series)|''Eiffel Tower'' series]].\n\nThe following year, he married Terk, and the couple settled in a studio apartment in Paris, where their son [[Charles Delaunay|Charles]] was born in January 1911. The same year, at the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Delaunay joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of artists. Delaunay was also successful in Germany, Switzerland, and Russia. He participated in the first Blanc Reiter exhibition in Munich and sold four works. Delaunay's paintings encouraged an enthusiastic response with Blaue Reiter. The Blaue Reiter connections led to Erwin Ritter von Busse's article \"Robert Delaunay\u2019s Methods of Compositions\" which appeared in the 1912 ''Blaue Reiter Almanac''. Delaunay would go to exhibit in February of that year, in the second Blaue Reiter exhibition in Munich and Valet de Carrean in Moscow.\n\n[[Image:Robert Delaunay, 1913, Premier Disque, 134 cm, 52.7 inches, Private collection.jpg|thumb|200px|''Le Premier Disque'', (1912\u20131913).

The exhibition showed forty-six works from his early Impressionist works to his Cubist Eiffel Tower painting from 1909\u20131911.\nArt Critic Guillaume Apollinaire praised those works of the exhibition and proclaimed Delaunay as \"an artist who has a monumental vision of the world.\"\n\nIn the March 23, 1912, issue of ''L'Assiette au Beurre'', The first published suggestion that Delaunay had broken with this group of Cubists appeared, in James Burkley's review of that year's Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants. \nBurkley wrote, \"The Cubists, who occupy only a room, have multiplied. Their leaders, Picasso and Braque, have not participated in their grouping, and Delaunay, commonly labeled a Cubist, has wished to isolate himself and declare that he has nothing in common with Metzinger or Le Fauconnier.\"\n\nWith [[Apollinaire]], Delaunay traveled to [[Berlin]] in January 1913 for an exhibition of his work at [[Der Sturm|Galerie Der Sturm]]. On their way back to Paris, the two stayed with [[August Macke]] in [[Bonn]], where Macke introduced them to [[Max Ernst]].<ref name=wb>Willard Bohn: Apollinaire and the international avant-garde (1997), {{ISBN|0-7914-3195-9}}, p82</ref> When his painting ''La ville de Paris'' was rejected by the [[Armory Show]] as being too big<ref>''La ville de Paris'' measures 234X294cm.</ref> he instructed [[Samuel Halpert]] to remove all his works from the show.<ref name=kh/>\n\n===Spanish and Portuguese years (1914\u20131920)===\nAt the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914 Sonia and Robert were staying in [[Fontarabie]] in Spain.

Her areas of expertise are in [[climate change]] and [[paleoclimatology]], including the [[climate of Antarctica]], the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]], and impacts on the [[climate of Australia]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nAbram grew up in [[Wangi Wangi, New South Wales]], Australia. She completed her secondary education at Toronto High School.\n\nAbram completed a Bachelor of Science (Advanced) degree at the University of Sydney in 2000. This degree included an honours project studying the [[Holocene]] climate history of the [[Ryukyu Islands]], Japan. She graduated from her undergraduate studies with the [[University Medal]].\n\nAbram then commenced her PhD through the Research School of Earth Sciences at the [[Australian National University]] in 2004.

Her areas of expertise are in [[climate change]] and [[paleoclimatology]], including the [[climate of Antarctica]], the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]], and impacts on the [[climate of Australia]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nAbram grew up in [[Wangi Wangi, New South Wales]], Australia. She completed her secondary education at Toronto High School.\n\nAbram completed a Bachelor of Science (Advanced) degree at the University of Sydney in 2000. This degree included an honours project studying the [[Holocene]] climate history of the [[Ryukyu Islands]], Japan. She graduated from her undergraduate studies with the [[University Medal]].\n\nAbram then commenced her PhD through the Research School of Earth Sciences at the [[Australian National University]] in 2004. During this time she was the recipient of the John Conrad Jaeger Scholarship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jaeger Scholarship|url=http://cmbe-cpms.anu.edu.au/study/scholarships-prizes/scholarships/john-conrad-jaeger-earth-sciences-scholarship/|accessdate=2014-08-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140617064907/http://cmbe-cpms.anu.edu.au/study/scholarships-prizes/scholarships/john-conrad-jaeger-earth-sciences-scholarship|archivedate=2014-06-17}}</ref> Her postgraduate studies earned her the Mervyn and Kaitalin Paterson Fellowship<ref>{{cite web|title=Paterson Fellowship|url=http://students.anu.edu.au/scholarships/gr/off/int/paterson-fellowship.php|accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref> and the Robert Hill Memorial Prize for excellence in scientific research, communication and outreach.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Hill Memorial Prize|url=http://students.anu.edu.au/graduation/prizes/cpms/robert-hill-memorial-prize.php|accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nAbram's research expertise spans Antarctic and tropical climate systems. She uses [[Porites]] corals, [[Speleothem]] samples from caves and [[Ice core]] samples to reconstruct [[Climate change (general concept)|climate changes in the past]] to provide a crucial long-term perspective on [[Climate change|recent and projected future climate changes]].

In 1923 she purchased a tract of {{convert|1000|acre|km2|sigfig=1}} in Southfield Township, in southern Oakland County, and proceeded to plat a residential neighborhood that encompasses the city of {{convert|1.5|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. Lathrup Townsite was conceived as a controlled community with rigorous standards, including houses built only of [[masonry]] construction; early integration of attached garages; as well as established minimums for construction cost to ensure quality (source: City of Lathrup Village). As the community developed, Mrs. Kelley implemented numerous innovative directives, including operating a shuttle service to local shopping areas, and allowing the financing of automobiles as part of the financing of houses, which created a stronger connection between the relatively isolated townsite and more established suburbs, as well as the city of [[Detroit]]. Mr. Charles Kelley, who had been a real estate writer for the ''Detroit News'', assisted his wife in bringing talented architects to the community to design many of the custom homes that are features of the community.{{Citation needed | reason=unsourced content. |date=February 2020}}\n\nThe City of Lathrup Village was incorporated in 1953 as the first incorporated community in Southfield Township. The residents thwarted an attempt by township residents to include Lathrup Townsite in their planned incorporation of the city of Southfield, resulting in Southfield's incorporation being delayed until 1958. Louise Lathrup Kelley played an active role in the new city until her death in 1963, after which her remaining real estate holdings in the city were sold and developed.{{Citation needed | reason=unsourced content. |date=February 2020}}\n\n===Lathrup Village Historic District===\nIn 1998 much of Lathrup Village was included in the [[Lathrup Village Historic District]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]<ref>http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregsearchresult.do?fullresult=true&recordid=0</ref>. The district includes approximately 1,200 properties, primarily residential, that reflect characteristic housing styles from the first half of the 20th century. These include Colonial Revival, Tudor and ranch houses. According to the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office: \u201cThe district possesses a strong geometric street pattern integrated with curvilinear patterns that provide a rural character. This layering of patterns produces octagonal, circular and semi-circular focal points and a series of small triangular parks scattered throughout the district. It also creates unique and changing perspectives, as views of significant buildings suddenly appear at surprising moments. Likewise, at the uniquely configured intersections of many streets, one is met with a new perspective as suddenly several sections of the district become visible.\u201d The developer of the district was Louise Lathrup Kelley. According to the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office \u201cAs a woman acting as developer starting in the 1920s, she was essentially alone, however her dogged persistence and insistence on quality resulted in a unique community that was the summation of her career.\u201d{{Citation needed|reason=Michigan State Historic Preservation Office was mentioned as source, but I can't find these quotes. |date=February 2020}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Michigan}}\n*[http://www.lathrupvillage.org City website]\n\n{{Oakland County, Michigan}}\n{{Metro Detroit}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Oakland County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1923]]\n[[Category:Enclaves in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|name                     = Lathrup Village, Michigan\n|official_name            = City of Lathrup Village\n|other_name               = \n|native_name              = <!-- for cities whose native name is not in English -->\n|nickname                 = \n|settlement_type          = [[City]]\n|motto                    = \n|image_skyline            = LathrupVillageMI CityHall.jpg\n|imagesize                = 275\n|image_caption            = Lathrup Village City Hall\n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               = \n|image_shield             =\n\n|pushpin_map            =Michigan\n|pushpin_label_position =left<!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n|pushpin_label          =Lathrup Village\n|pushpin_map_caption    =Location within the state of Michigan\n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n|image_map                = Lathrup Village, MI location.png\n|mapsize                  = 250\n|map_caption              = Location within [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]]\n\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in Michigan|County]]\n|subdivision_name         = United States\n|subdivision_name1        = [[Michigan]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland]]\n|government_type          = [[Council\u2013manager government|Council\u2013manager]]\n|leader_title             = [[Mayor]]\n|leader_name              = Mykale (Kelly) Garrett\n|leader_title1            = \n|leader_name1             =\n|established_title        = Organized\n|established_date         = 1923\n|established_title2       = Incorporated\n|established_date2        = 1953\n|established_title3       = \n|established_date3        = \n|unit_pref                = Imperial\n|area_footnotes           = <ref name=\"CenPopGazetteer2016\">{{cite web|title=2017 U.S. Gazetteer Files|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2017_Gazetteer/2017_gaz_place_26.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=Jan 3, 2019}}</ref>\n|area_total_km2           = 3.90\n|area_land_km2            = 3.90\n|area_water_km2           = 0.00\n|area_total_sq_mi         = 1.51\n|area_land_sq_mi          = 1.51\n|area_water_sq_mi         = 0.00\n|area_water_percent       =\n<!-- Population -->\n|population_as_of         = [[2010 United States Census|2010]]\n|population_est           = 4121\n|pop_est_as_of            = 2018\n|population_footnotes     = <ref name =\"FactFinder\"/>\n|population_total         = 4075\n|population_density_km2   = 1057.49\n|population_density_sq_mi = 2739.71\n|population_metro         = 4296250 ([[Metro Detroit]])\n|timezone                 = [[Eastern Standard Time Zone|EST]]\n|utc_offset               = -5\n|timezone_DST             = [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]]\n|utc_offset_DST           = -4\n|coordinates              = {{coord|42|29|47|N|83|13|22|W|region:US-MI|display=inline,title}}\n|elevation_footnotes      = <!--for references: use <ref> </ref> tags-->\n|elevation_m              = 215\n|elevation_ft             = 705\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP Code|ZIP code(s)]]\n|postal_code              = 48076\n|area_code                = [[Area codes 248 and 947|248]]\n|blank_name               = [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info               = 26-46320<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212221153/http://factfinder.census.gov/main.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2020-02-12|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}</ref>\n|blank1_name              = [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] feature ID\n|blank1_info              = 0630184<ref>{{gnis|0630184}}</ref>\n|website                  = {{URL|http://www.lathrupvillage.org/|Official website}}\n|footnotes                = \n|pop_est_footnotes = <ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n}}\n'''Lathrup Village''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|l|e\u026a|\u03b8|r|\u0259|p}} {{respell|LAY|thr\u0259p}}) is a city in [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]].

In 1923 she purchased a tract of {{convert|1000|acre|km2|sigfig=1}} in Southfield Township, in southern Oakland County, and proceeded to plat a residential neighborhood that encompasses the city of {{convert|1.5|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. Lathrup Townsite was conceived as a controlled community with rigorous standards, including houses built only of [[masonry]] construction; early integration of attached garages; as well as established minimums for construction cost to ensure quality (source: City of Lathrup Village). As the community developed, Mrs. Kelley implemented numerous innovative directives, including operating a shuttle service to local shopping areas, and allowing the financing of automobiles as part of the financing of houses, which created a stronger connection between the relatively isolated townsite and more established suburbs, as well as the city of [[Detroit]]. Mr. Charles Kelley, who had been a real estate writer for the ''Detroit News'', assisted his wife in bringing talented architects to the community to design many of the custom homes that are features of the community.{{Citation needed | reason=unsourced content. |date=February 2020}}\n\nThe City of Lathrup Village was incorporated in 1953 as the first incorporated community in Southfield Township. The residents thwarted an attempt by township residents to include Lathrup Townsite in their planned incorporation of the city of Southfield, resulting in Southfield's incorporation being delayed until 1958. Louise Lathrup Kelley played an active role in the new city until her death in 1963, after which her remaining real estate holdings in the city were sold and developed.{{Citation needed | reason=unsourced content. |date=February 2020}}\n\n===Lathrup Village Historic District===\nIn 1998 much of Lathrup Village was included in the [[Lathrup Village Historic District]] on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]<ref>http://nrhp.focus.nps.gov/natregsearchresult.do?fullresult=true&recordid=0</ref>. The district includes approximately 1,200 properties, primarily residential, that reflect characteristic housing styles from the first half of the 20th century. These include Colonial Revival, Tudor and ranch houses. According to the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office: \u201cThe district possesses a strong geometric street pattern integrated with curvilinear patterns that provide a rural character. This layering of patterns produces octagonal, circular and semi-circular focal points and a series of small triangular parks scattered throughout the district. It also creates unique and changing perspectives, as views of significant buildings suddenly appear at surprising moments. Likewise, at the uniquely configured intersections of many streets, one is met with a new perspective as suddenly several sections of the district become visible.\u201d The developer of the district was Louise Lathrup Kelley. According to the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office \u201cAs a woman acting as developer starting in the 1920s, she was essentially alone, however her dogged persistence and insistence on quality resulted in a unique community that was the summation of her career.\u201d{{Citation needed|reason=Michigan State Historic Preservation Office was mentioned as source, but I can't find these quotes. |date=February 2020}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Michigan}}\n*[http://www.lathrupvillage.org City website]\n\n{{Oakland County, Michigan}}\n{{Metro Detroit}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Oakland County, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1923]]\n[[Category:Enclaves in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lathrup_Village,_Michigan"}
