This was in reference to one of the episodes aired in the month of May where one of the female characters named Roja hires a criminal gang to sexually assault her own sister. She ordered the men to show no mercy on her during this preplanned assault. The gang instead of following through the plan, enact the same plan on Roja. The controversial episodes were telecast on May 14, 15 and June 28.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/television/250919/director-says-sorry-for-sexual-assault-scenes-in-tv-soap.html|title=Director says sorry for sexual assault scenes in TV soap|last=|first=|date=|website=Deccan Chronicle|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nThe council, on examining the video clips based on the complaints, has said in their order that the content violated the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) guidelines which bars content that glorifies violence, as well as incite or encourage viewers to obscene or indecent behaviour. A notice was issued to the channel and in their reply to the council, Sun TV and Thiru Pictures had clarified and apologised to the Council.

This was in reference to one of the episodes aired in the month of May where one of the female characters named Roja hires a criminal gang to sexually assault her own sister. She ordered the men to show no mercy on her during this preplanned assault. The gang instead of following through the plan, enact the same plan on Roja. The controversial episodes were telecast on May 14, 15 and June 28.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/television/250919/director-says-sorry-for-sexual-assault-scenes-in-tv-soap.html|title=Director says sorry for sexual assault scenes in TV soap|last=|first=|date=|website=Deccan Chronicle|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nThe council, on examining the video clips based on the complaints, has said in their order that the content violated the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) guidelines which bars content that glorifies violence, as well as incite or encourage viewers to obscene or indecent behaviour. A notice was issued to the channel and in their reply to the council, Sun TV and Thiru Pictures had clarified and apologised to the Council.

Despite the Chinese title, which translates as ''Knight of Gamblers 1999'', Andy Lau does not reprise his role as the \"Knight of Gamblers\" from the ''[[God of Gamblers]]'' series, which was also directed by Wong Jing. The film was followed by a sequel ''[[The Conmen in Vegas]]'', which Lau and Cheung return with new cast members [[Natalis Chan]], [[Kelly Lin]], Meggie Yu and [[Alex Man]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhen King stays overnight at his mistress' place, his pregnant wife Fanny discovers them and Fanny sadly leaves King. One time King and his assistant, Chung, were gambling cards with Chimney and Chimney finds out that they were secretly videotaping him, they start to fight. For self-defense reasons, King resorts to using a knife to kill Chimney, which not only leaves him colorblind, but also resulted in a five-year imprisonment for manslaughter. While in prison, King learns horse racing skills.\n\nFive years later, King is released from prison and a small-time gambler, Dragon, who always worship King, greets him when King's friend Uncle Leng tells Dragon to pick him up. King and Dragon become partners and they make money together from horse racing, which at that time King also meets Dragon's younger sister Ching. King discovers that Ching's fianc\u00e9 Raymond is a swindler (Raymond lies about going to college in the United States, when he is actually a swindler who cheats women out of their money). With the help from Dragon and Rocky, (whom King beat in billiards, later became his mentor), King stages a plan where they make Raymond think that he killed King forcing him to flee to Cambodia. After King helps Ching, he wins her love.\n\nAt the same time, King is also looking for Fanny and his son. One day Rocky brings King to Macau Mon's gambling cruise boat and King is recognized by Handsome, who is Chimney's younger brother. On the boat, King also sees Chung, who lied to him by saying that after he went to prison, Fanny committed suicide by jumping off a building. When King finds Chung's residence, he finds out that after he went to prison, Fanny was taken care by Chung and his son Little King now lives with Chung.\n\nLater, when King is playing with his son, they encounter Handsome, who is seeking revenge and causes Little King to be injured and hospitalized. Handsome also kidnaps Fanny and Chung and blackmails King to help him get rid of his own boss Macau Mon. Macau Mon has invested a large number of stakes bet on the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] for the French team to win, and as long as they can create an image of the Brazilian Team winning during the time when several experts are gambling with cards, it will give Macau Mon a heart attack and allow Handsome to replace his medicine with poisoned water.\n\nAfter suffering from a big blow, King becomes depressed but is consoled by Ching. In order to save Fanny and Chung, King and Dragon hire an adult film director, Squirrel, to film some fake footage of the World Cup. After completing this, King decides to fulfill Ching's wish of traveling to Europe together and meets her at the bus station the next day.\n\nOn the night of the World Cup final, King, Handsome, Winning Gary and Macau Mon are gambling cards while watching the live broadcast of the World Cup in which they bet on (King bets on Brazil while Macau Mon bets on France). At the same time on the other side, in order to create a false game screen performance of the horse cross to stimulate Macau Mon, they take the footage filmed by Squirrel which features anchor Lam Seung-wai and Dragon pretending as Ronaldo and other players to intersperse with the real broadcast. In the end, Brazil wins three to two against France, but in reality, [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|France wins 3\u20130 against Brazil]]. After seeing this, Macau Mon suffers from a heart attack and dies.\n\nJust when Handsome thinks Macau Mon's casino belongs to him and is ready to get rid of King, Macau Mon unexpectedly stands behind him and points a gun at him. It turns out that during the card game, King gave a two of spades card to Macau Mon telling him the water is poisoned in order to help him. Macau Mon shoots and kills Handsome.\n\nIn the end, King goes to the bus station the next morning to wait for Ching but King was unexpectedly run over by Dragon who was in a hurry.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Andy Lau]] as King\n*[[Athena Chu]] as Ching\n*[[Nick Cheung]] as Dragon\n*[[Waise Lee]] as Handsome\n*[[Jack Kao]] as Macau Mon\n*[[Angie Cheung]] as Fanny\n*Emotion Cheung as Chung\n*[[Bonnie Law]] as King's mistress\n*[[Lee Siu-kei]] as Winner Gary\n*Frankie Ng as Rocky\n*Karel Wong as Eastwood\n*Ben Ng as Bad Temper / Chimney\n*[[Wong Jing]] as Squirrel\n*[[Lam Sheung Yee]] as Lam Seung-wai\n*Alan Man as Raymond Chou\n*Yeung Kin-wai as Angela\n*Wong Kam-tong as Uncle Leng\n*[[Aman Chang]] as man in toilet\n*John Cheung as cop\n*Gary Mak as cruise gambler\n*Johnny Cheung as Bad Temper's gangster\n*So Wai-nam as Bad Temper's gangster\n*Eddie Che as Handsome's gangster\n*Vincent Chik as Handsome's gangster\n*Chow Man-sing as Handsome's gangster\n*Tam Tin-po as woman in advertisement\n*Yu Ka-ho\n\n==Box office==\nThe film grossed HK$17,369,190 at the Hong Kong box office during its theatrical run from 18 December 1998 to 19 January 1999 in [[Hong Kong]].\n\n==Award nominations==\n*'''[[18th Hong Kong Film Awards]]'''\n**Nominated: [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] ([[Nick Cheung]])\n\n==See also==\n*[[Andy Lau filmography]]\n*[[Wong Jing filmography]]\n\n==External links==\n*{{hkmdb title|8417}}\n*''[http://www.hkcinemagic.com/en/movie.asp?id=591 The Conman]'' at [[Hong Kong Cinemagic]]\n*{{IMDb title|0184354|Du xia 1999}}\n*[http://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews_2/conman.htm ''The Conman'' film review] at LoveHKFilm.com\n\n{{Hong Kong Gambling films}}\n{{Wong Jing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conman}}\n[[Category:Hong Kong films]]\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1990s action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about con artists]]\n[[Category:Gambling films]]\n[[Category:Cantonese-language films]]\n[[Category:China Star Entertainment Group films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wong Jing]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Hong Kong]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=April 2019}}\n{{Use Hong Kong English|date=January 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Conman\n| image          = Conman1998.jpg\n| alt            = \n| caption        = \n| film name = {{Film name| traditional    = \u8ced\u4fe01999\n| simplified     = \u8d4c\u4fa01999\n| pinyin         = D\u01d4 Xi\u00e1 Y\u012b Ji\u01d4 Ji\u01d4 Ji\u01d4\n| jyutping       = Dou2 Hap6 Jat1 Gau2 Gau2 Gau2}}\n| director       = [[Wong Jing]]\n| producer       = Wong Jing\n| writer         = Wong Jing\n| starring       = [[Andy Lau]]<br>[[Athena Chu]]<br>[[Nick Cheung]]<br>[[Waise Lee]]<br>[[Jack Kao]]<br>[[Angie Cheung]]<br>Emotion Cheung<br>Bonnie Law\n| music          = Lincoln Lo\n| cinematography = Ko Chiu-lam\n| editing        = [[Marco Mak]]\n| studio         = [[Win's Entertainment]]<br>[[BoB and Partners Co.

After King helps Ching, he wins her love.\n\nAt the same time, King is also looking for Fanny and his son. One day Rocky brings King to Macau Mon's gambling cruise boat and King is recognized by Handsome, who is Chimney's younger brother. On the boat, King also sees Chung, who lied to him by saying that after he went to prison, Fanny committed suicide by jumping off a building. When King finds Chung's residence, he finds out that after he went to prison, Fanny was taken care by Chung and his son Little King now lives with Chung.\n\nLater, when King is playing with his son, they encounter Handsome, who is seeking revenge and causes Little King to be injured and hospitalized. Handsome also kidnaps Fanny and Chung and blackmails King to help him get rid of his own boss Macau Mon. Macau Mon has invested a large number of stakes bet on the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] for the French team to win, and as long as they can create an image of the Brazilian Team winning during the time when several experts are gambling with cards, it will give Macau Mon a heart attack and allow Handsome to replace his medicine with poisoned water.\n\nAfter suffering from a big blow, King becomes depressed but is consoled by Ching. In order to save Fanny and Chung, King and Dragon hire an adult film director, Squirrel, to film some fake footage of the World Cup. After completing this, King decides to fulfill Ching's wish of traveling to Europe together and meets her at the bus station the next day.\n\nOn the night of the World Cup final, King, Handsome, Winning Gary and Macau Mon are gambling cards while watching the live broadcast of the World Cup in which they bet on (King bets on Brazil while Macau Mon bets on France). At the same time on the other side, in order to create a false game screen performance of the horse cross to stimulate Macau Mon, they take the footage filmed by Squirrel which features anchor Lam Seung-wai and Dragon pretending as Ronaldo and other players to intersperse with the real broadcast. In the end, Brazil wins three to two against France, but in reality, [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|France wins 3-0 against Brazil]]. After seeing this, Macau Mon suffers from a heart attack and dies.\n\nJust when Handsome thinks Macau Mon's casino belongs to him and is ready to get rid of King, Macau Mon unexpectedly stands behind him and points a gun at him. It turns out that during the card game, King gave a two of spades card to Macau Mon telling him the water is poisoned in order to help him. Macau Mon shoots and kills Handsome.\n\nIn the end, King goes to the bus station the next morning to wait for Ching but King was unexpectedly run over by Dragon who was in a hurry.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Andy Lau]] as King\n*[[Athena Chu]] as Ching\n*[[Nick Cheung]] as Dragon\n*[[Waise Lee]] as Handsome\n*[[Jack Kao]] as Macau Mon\n*[[Angie Cheung]] as Fanny\n*Emotion Cheung as Chung\n*[[Bonnie Law]] as King's mistress\n*[[Lee Siu-kei]] as Winner Gary\n*Frankie Ng as Rocky\n*Karel Wong as Eastwood\n*Ben Ng as Bad Temper / Chimney\n*[[Wong Jing]] as Squirrel\n*[[Lam Sheung Yee]] as Lam Seung-wai\n*Alan Man as Raymond Chou\n*Yeung Kin-wai as Angela\n*Wong Kam-tong as Uncle Leng\n*[[Aman Chang]] as man in toilet\n*John Cheung as cop\n*Gary Mak as cruise gambler\n*Johnny Cheung as Bad Temper's gangster\n*So Wai-nam as Bad Temper's gangster\n*Eddie Che as Handsome's gangster\n*Vincent Chik as Handsome's gangster\n*Chow Man-sing as Handsome's gangster\n*Tam Tin-po as woman in advertisement\n*Yu Ka-ho\n\n==Box office==\nThe film grossed HK$17,369,190 at the Hong Kong box office during its theatrical run from 18 December 1998 to 19 January 1999 in [[Hong Kong]].\n\n==Award nominations==\n*'''[[18th Hong Kong Film Awards]]'''\n**Nominated: [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] ([[Nick Cheung]])\n\n==See also==\n*[[Andy Lau filmography]]\n*[[Wong Jing filmography]]\n\n==External links==\n*{{hkmdb title|8417}}\n*''[http://www.hkcinemagic.com/en/movie.asp?id=591 The Conman]'' at [[Hong Kong Cinemagic]]\n*{{IMDb title|0184354|Du xia 1999}}\n*[http://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews_2/conman.htm ''The Conman'' film review] at LoveHKFilm.com\n\n{{Hong Kong Gambling films}}\n{{Wong Jing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conman}}\n[[Category:Hong Kong films]]\n[[Category:1998 films]]\n[[Category:1990s action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Hong Kong action comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films about con artists]]\n[[Category:Gambling films]]\n[[Category:Cantonese-language films]]\n[[Category:China Star Entertainment Group films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wong Jing]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Hong Kong]]\n", "name_user": "J947", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot:Typo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 3-0 \u2192 3\u20130, fiance \u2192 fianc\u00e9", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conman"}

Soon after getting caught in Lady Compton's library fulfilling her joy of reading and learning, Maisie is introduced to Maurice Blanche, close friend of the Comptons, and becomes his pupil. Blanche, a discreet [[Private investigator|investigator]], teaches Maisie as much as he can about [[psychology]], [[science]], and anything else Maisie is willing to learn. When Maisie becomes old enough she attends [[Girton College]] at [[Cambridge University]], but threats of war soon intervene. [[World War I]] intensifies, and the pressures of war can be felt in Maisie's England. Deciding that the war efforts are extremely important to her and her country, Maisie volunteers as a nurse at the front, where she meets a young man, with whom she falls in love. Part of the mystery surrounding Maisie is what happens to the young man.\n\nAfter the war, Maisie [[apprentices]] with Blanche in his investigative work. In 1929, after Blanche has retired, Maisie opens her own investigation business. Her first seemingly open-and-shut case involves her in a mystery surrounding something known as The Retreat, a suspicious home for veterans of the war. Maisie must act fast when she learns that Lady Compton's own son has signed over his fortune to The Retreat and is about to take asylum there. With the help of Billy Beale, a caretaker at her office and veteran of the [[Great War]] himself, she is able to infiltrate The Retreat. As Maisie uncovers the mystery of The Retreat she is also confronted with her own ghosts from the war after ten years of holding the memories at bay.\n\n==Major themes==\nIn an interview with Jacqueline Winspear, Andi Schechter of ''[[Library Journal]]'' points out that \"World War I is a major theme\" in the book.<ref>Schechter, Andi.

There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends\u2014ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building a fire and leaving it to continue his journey, he later attempts to build another fails, then tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fails to do either. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].\n\nThe 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.\n\nThe 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].\n\n==1908 version plot==\nAn unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221259&nbsp;\u00b0C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors \"the boys\" at their camp by six o'clock that evening.\n\nAt half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire, this one under a tree in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.\n\n==Character relationships==\nThe protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures, but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit. London even describes the dog as his \"toil-slave\".<ref name=\"story\">{{cite magazine|date=August 1908|title=To Build a Fire|volume=76|last=London|first=Jack|magazine=The Century Magazine |pages=525\u2013534 |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/LostFace/fire.html |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the famous second version, published for an adult audience.</ref>\n\nWhile the man sees the dog only as his slave on the journey, the dog sees the man as a provider of his needs, which helps follow his [[instincts]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Placing the dog in the story allowed London to show the wisdom of nature over the [[arrogance]] of the man, which eventually leads to his demise. <ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Never Travel Alone\": Naturalism, Jack London, and the White Silence |author=Jeanne Campbell Reesman |magazine=American Literary Realism, 1870\u20131910 |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=33\u201349 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |jstor=27746687 }}</ref> Doing so, allowed London to show that animals survive through instinct.

The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.\n\nOne theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.\n\nThe protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />\n\n\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described \u201cHe did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/perseverance-theme.html|title=To Build a Fire Theme of Perseverance|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\n\"[[Wisdom and Experience]]\" Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience. London shows us throughout the story that the man lacks the knowledge in order to survive in the Yukon.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Welsh |first1=James |title=Masterplots II: Short Story Series |journal=Revised Edition |date=2004 |volume=1 |pages=1\u20133 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/lrc/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=2ee11b99-9eb2-45d3-9942-5949eaec8c5a%40pdc-v-sessmgr03&bdata=JnNpdGU9bHJjLWxpdmU%3d#AN=103331MSS23119240001174&db=lfh |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> Based on instincts, the dog knew that it was too cold to travel in the snow. London wrote: \u201cThe dog was sorry to leave and looked toward the fire.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=\"To Build a Fire\" |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> This line indicates that the dog wanted to be closer to heat. However, the unnamed protagonist ignored all the signs before him. He knew that it was cold but he did not realize the threat this posed on his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/themes.html|title=To Build a Fire Themes|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\nStupidity and arrogance are personified in the story's protagonist. For example, he goes through the extremely cold territory alone, despite going for the first time. He laughs off the crucial advice from the old man of Sulphur Creek about traveling with an acquaintance because he thinks he knows what he's doing. This arrogance results in the protagonist putting himself in a dangerous situation that was preventable. At first, he thinks it's nothing and that everything will be fine. By the end of the story, he dies as a result of his arrogance. Through this story, London shows how the man's demise is due to his humanity and lack of thought when going into this journey. Also, he shows that the dog survives because of following its instincts which is something that the man does not pay attention to.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowen |first1=James |title='To Build a Fire': Epistemology and the White Wilderness |journal=Western American Literature |date=1971 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=287\u2013289|doi=10.1353/wal.1971.0004 }}</ref> Another example of arrogance occurs when the protagonist disregards the possibility that there may be situations he cannot overcome. The old man warns the protagonist of this and also seems to have a better understanding of the natural world, respecting the fact that there are some situations the man will be unable to control. Not only does the old man see the protagonist's stupidity, but the dog notices the man's lack of knowledge about the terrain and its obstacles after he fails to keep a fire going.\n\nSuccumbing to death is another theme in the story: more specifically the peace that may be found in death. London foreshadows the death of the man early in the story, so it is not a surprise that the man dies and closer to the end, he recalls the cold and the old timer as he accepts his fate. However, London depicts death quite differently than many other authors do. The man drifts off into a calm, peaceful slumber devoid of suffering and pain. London's use of relaxing words dissuades the reader from feeling a great deal of sympathy for the man, as the death is merciful and graciously anticipated, rather than sad. In contrast to more dramatic depictions of death, London's depiction reveals death as a peaceful escape from tumult and pain.\n\nIndividualism is another common theme London portrays in the story. The man only relies on himself to get him through the Yukon; he doesn't believe that he needs any help. This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/cview.cgi/jmurj/vol4/iss1/7|title=James Madison University \u2013 Log in |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |website=commons.lib.jmu.edu |url-access=registration |access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==1902 version==\nThe earlier version was first published in ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' on May 29, 1902.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=London |first=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/writings/Uncollected/tobuildafire.html |magazine=Youth's Companion |volume=76 |date=May 29, 1902 |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the first, more juvenile version.</ref> Although it differs in some details, the general structure and storyline are similar; the primary differences are as follows: in the first version it is not as cold, there is no dog, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers some permanent frostbite damage but survives, sad but wiser.\n\n==Films==\n*''[[:fr:Construire un feu (film, 1928)|Construire un feu]]'' (1927\u20131928) is an early short film by [[Claude Autant-Lara]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unifrance.org/film/34430/construire-un-feu |title=Construire un feu |language=fr |website=UNIFRANCE |access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019787/combined |title=Construire un feu (1930) |website=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> \n*''To Build a Fire'' (1969) was made by [[David Cobham]], with [[Ian Hogg (actor)|Ian Hogg]] as the man and [[Orson Welles]] as the narrator.<ref name=\"Yahoo\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800395257/info |title=To Build a Fire (1969) |website=Yahoo!

With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.\n\n==Character relationships==\nThe protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures, but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit. London even describes the dog as his \"toil-slave\".<ref name=\"story\">{{cite magazine|date=August 1908|title=To Build a Fire|volume=76|last=London|first=Jack|magazine=The Century Magazine |pages=525\u2013534 |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/Writings/LostFace/fire.html |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the famous second version, published for an adult audience.</ref>\n\nWhile the man sees the dog only as his slave on the journey, the dog sees the man as a provider of his needs, which helps follow his [[instincts]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Placing the dog in the story allowed London to show the wisdom of nature over the [[arrogance]] of the man, which eventually leads to his demise. <ref>{{cite magazine |title=\"Never Travel Alone\": Naturalism, Jack London, and the White Silence |author=Jeanne Campbell Reesman |magazine=American Literary Realism, 1870\u20131910 |volume=29 |issue=2 |date=Winter 1997 |pages=33\u201349 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |jstor=27746687 }}</ref> Doing so, allowed London to show that animals survive through instinct.

The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.\n\nOne theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.\n\nThe protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />\n\n\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described \u201cHe did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/perseverance-theme.html|title=To Build a Fire Theme of Perseverance|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\n\"[[Wisdom and Experience]]\" Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience. London shows us throughout the story that the man lacks the knowledge in order to survive in the Yukon.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Welsh |first1=James |title=Masterplots II: Short Story Series |journal=Revised Edition |date=2004 |volume=1 |pages=1\u20133 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/lrc/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=2ee11b99-9eb2-45d3-9942-5949eaec8c5a%40pdc-v-sessmgr03&bdata=JnNpdGU9bHJjLWxpdmU%3d#AN=103331MSS23119240001174&db=lfh |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> Based on instincts, the dog knew that it was too cold to travel in the snow. London wrote: \u201cThe dog was sorry to leave and looked toward the fire.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=\"To Build a Fire\" |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> This line indicates that the dog wanted to be closer to heat. However, the unnamed protagonist ignored all the signs before him. He knew that it was cold but he did not realize the threat this posed on his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/themes.html|title=To Build a Fire Themes|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\nStupidity and arrogance are personified in the story's protagonist. For example, he goes through the extremely cold territory alone, despite going for the first time. He laughs off the crucial advice from the old man of Sulphur Creek about traveling with an acquaintance because he thinks he knows what he's doing. This arrogance results in the protagonist putting himself in a dangerous situation that was preventable. At first, he thinks it's nothing and that everything will be fine. By the end of the story, he dies as a result of his arrogance. Through this story, London shows how the man's demise is due to his humanity and lack of thought when going into this journey. Also, he shows that the dog survives because of following its instincts which is something that the man does not pay attention to.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowen |first1=James |title='To Build a Fire': Epistemology and the White Wilderness |journal=Western American Literature |date=1971 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=287\u2013289|doi=10.1353/wal.1971.0004 }}</ref> Another example of arrogance occurs when the protagonist disregards the possibility that there may be situations he cannot overcome. The old man warns the protagonist of this and also seems to have a better understanding of the natural world, respecting the fact that there are some situations the man will be unable to control. Not only does the old man see the protagonist's stupidity, but the dog notices the man's lack of knowledge about the terrain and its obstacles after he fails to keep a fire going.\n\nSuccumbing to death is another theme in the story: more specifically the peace that may be found in death. London foreshadows the death of the man early in the story, so it is not a surprise that the man dies. However, London depicts death quite differently than many other authors do. The man drifts off into a calm, peaceful slumber devoid of suffering and pain. London's use of relaxing words dissuades the reader from feeling a great deal of sympathy for the man, as the death is merciful and graciously anticipated, rather than sad. In contrast to more dramatic depictions of death, London's depiction reveals death as a peaceful escape from tumult and pain.\n\nIndividualism is another common theme London portrays in the story. The man only relies on himself to get him through the Yukon; he doesn't believe that he needs any help. This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/cview.cgi/jmurj/vol4/iss1/7|title=James Madison University \u2013 Log in |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |website=commons.lib.jmu.edu |url-access=registration |access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==1902 version==\nThe earlier version was first published in ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' on May 29, 1902.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=London |first=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/writings/Uncollected/tobuildafire.html |magazine=Youth's Companion |volume=76 |date=May 29, 1902 |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the first, more juvenile version.</ref> Although it differs in some details, the general structure and storyline are similar; the primary differences are as follows: in the first version it is not as cold, there is no dog, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers some permanent frostbite damage but survives, sad but wiser.\n\n==Films==\n*''[[:fr:Construire un feu (film, 1928)|Construire un feu]]'' (1927\u20131928) is an early short film by [[Claude Autant-Lara]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unifrance.org/film/34430/construire-un-feu |title=Construire un feu |language=fr |website=UNIFRANCE |access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019787/combined |title=Construire un feu (1930) |website=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> \n*''To Build a Fire'' (1969) was made by [[David Cobham]], with [[Ian Hogg (actor)|Ian Hogg]] as the man and [[Orson Welles]] as the narrator.<ref name=\"Yahoo\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800395257/info |title=To Build a Fire (1969) |website=Yahoo!

They write to each other telling each other about their doings and happenings in life. They get to meet after a long time as Sameer with his mother and sister visit Nachiket's village for a family wedding.\n\nSameer and Nachiket both observe people in the house and try to understand their behaviour as they are not used to complexity of family relationships. Meanwhile, Sameer finds Nachiket's lonely and cut-off attitude towards the family quite strange and when he confronts Nachiket about it, Nachiket tells him about his outlook towards life which confuses Sameer even more. Both of them share interest in swimming in the well and playing hide and seek. While swimming in the well, Nachiket always uses a wooden support as he doesn't know how to swim while Sameer is going to represent his school in swimming competition.\n\nWith swimming trials scheduled, Sameer has to leave for his home. When he returns after two days, he comes to know that Nachiket drowned in the well and is no more. Sameer, appalled at the sudden death of his best friend, is unable to accept Nachiket's death and then starts Sameer's journey in search of truth. Deep inside, he believes that Nachiket has hidden himself somewhere, like he used to do when they played hide and seek; and wants Sameer to seek him.\n\nSameer looks everywhere for Nachiket but fails. His journey takes him by a train to a stone quarry where he meets one nomadic sheep herder. The shepherd shares his life experience with him when he was little about a lost lamb and how he finds it with the eyes of his heart. At last he remembers what Nachiket had told him about the hiding and seeking approach. He runs to the well in Nachiket's village and finds Nachiket there. They laugh and Sameer says that he has finally found him. They take a swim together in the well. It is inferred that Nachiket is dead but Sameer understands this fact after he completes his journey and understands that it is through the eyes of heart, one could find and remember the one who is not with us physically. The story ends with Sameer going back to his home in a bus, satisfied.\n\n==Cast==\n* Sameer: [[Madan Deodhar]]\n* Nachiket: [[Alok Rajwade]]\n* Ajoba (Grandfather) : [[Mohan Agashe]]\n* Aaji (Grandmother): [[Jyoti Subhash]] \n* Bau-Aaji : [[Sulabha Deshpande]]\n* Sulabha : Renuka Daftardar \n* Shobha : Ashwini Giri \n* Bhavasha Mama (uncle) : [[Girish Kulkarni]]\n* Prabha: [[Amruta Subhash]]\n* Seema  : Veena Jamkar\n* Tayadi : [[Parna Pethe]]\n* Soni: Sharavi Kulkarni \n* Ashu : Aditya Ganu\n* Anshu : Ajinkya Ganu \n* Sameer's Father : Kiran Yatnopavit \n* Nachiket's Father: Abhay Godse \n* Pickpocket: [[Shrikant Yadav]]\n* Shepherd : [[Vitthal Umap]]\n\n==Selection in festivals==\n* [[14th Busan International Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/vihir-film-review-1004021715.story |title=Vihir -- Film Review |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215171118/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film-reviews/vihir-film-review-1004021715.story |archivedate=15 February 2010 }}</ref>\n* 8th Pune International Film Festival, Pune, India\n* Kerala International Film Festival 2009\n* Berlin International Film Festival 2010 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.ndtv.com/movie_story.aspx?Section=Movies&ID=ENTEN20100131599&subcatg=MOVIESINDIA&keyword=regional |title=Marathi film 'Vihir' gets warm reception at Berlin film fest|date= 18 February 2010|location=Berlin|publisher=NDTV Movies}}</ref>\n* Rotterdam International Film Festival 2010\n* 26th Warsaw International Film Festival (2010)\n\n==Awards and achievements==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Award Name\n!Awardee\n!Film Festivals\n|-\n|Best Director\n|Umesh Kulkarni\n|\n|-\n|Best Cinematographer\n|Sudhir Palsane\n|PIFF 2010\n|-\n|Best Sound Design\n|Anthony B J Ruban\n|\n|-\n|Best Cinematographer\n|Sudhir Palsane\n|Zee gaurav Awards 2010\n|}\n\n==Sources==\n* [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-01-30/pune/28136877_1_vihir-marathi-film-berlin-film-fest Vihir' to be screened at Berlin Film Fest]\n* [http://www.indianexpress.com/news/after-national-film-awards-vihir-director/571754/ After National Film Awards, \u2018Vihir\u2019 director looks at Berlin]\n* [http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-09-19/pune/28108802_1_marathi-film-umesh-kulkarni-vihir ABCL's first Marathi film set for world premiere in S Korea]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.vihir.com}}\n* {{IMDb title|1515210}}\n* [http://screen.indianexpress.com/news/touching/594499/0 Touching  Namita Nivas | Fri 26 Mar 2010, Screen Indian Express]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Well}}\n[[Category:Marathi-language films]]\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Indian English|date=November 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2015}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Vihir\n| image          = Vihir.jpg\n| caption        = Film poster\n| director       = [[Umesh Vinayak Kulkarni]]\n| producer       = [[Amitabh Bachchan Corporation]]\n| screenplay     = [[Girish Kulkarni]], Satee Bhave\n| starring       = [[Madan Deodhar]]<br />[[Alok Rajwade]]<br />[[Mohan Agashe]]<br />[[Sulabha Deshpande]]<br />[[Jyoti Subhash]]\n| cinematography = Sudheer Palsane\n| editing        = Neeraj Voralia\n| released       = {{Film date|df=yes|2009|10|9|[[Pusan International Film Festival|PIFF]]}}\n| runtime        = 135 minutes\n| language       = Marathi\n| country        = India\n}}\n'''''Vihir''''' (English: The well)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vihir.com |title=Vihir \u0935\u093f\u0939\u0940\u0930}}</ref> is a [[Marathi cinema|Marathi]] film directed by Umesh Vinayak Kulkarni which was released in March 2010{{update after|2010|03|31}} and was featured in [[Berlin]] film festival and Rotterdam International Film Festival 2010, the Netherlands.\n\nThis is AB Corp Limited's first Marathi film.\n\n==Storyline==\nVihir is a story of two adolescent boys Sameer and Nachiket (cousins, who are best friends) who struggle with their unconventional outlooks on life and family.
