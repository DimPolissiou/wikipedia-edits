An often studied liquid biofluid problem is that of blood flow in the human cardiovascular system. Under certain mathematical circumstances, [[blood]] flow can be modeled by the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. ''In vivo'' [[whole blood]] is assumed to be an incompressible [[Newtonian fluid]]. However, this assumption fails when considering forward flow within [[arterioles]]. At the microscopic scale, the effects of individual [[red blood cells]] become significant, and whole blood can no longer be modeled as a continuum. When the diameter of the blood vessel is just slightly larger than the diameter of the red blood cell the [[Fahraeus\u2013Lindquist effect]] occurs and there is a decrease in wall [[shear stress]]. However, as the diameter of the blood vessel decreases further, the red blood cells have to squeeze through the vessel and often can only pass in a single file. In this case, the inverse Fahraeus\u2013Lindquist effect occurs and the wall shear stress increases.\n\nAn example of a gaseous biofluids problem is that of human respiration. Recently, respiratory systems in insects have been studied for [[bioinspiration]] for designing improved microfluidic devices.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Aboelkassem | first1=Yasser | year=2013 | title=Selective pumping in a network: insect-style microscale flow transport | journal=Bioinspiration & Biomimetics | volume=8 | issue=2 | pages=026004 | doi=10.1088/1748-3182/8/2/026004| pmid=23538838 |bibcode=2013BiBi....8b6004A }}</ref>\n\n=== Biotribology ===\nBiotribology is the study of [[friction]], [[wear]] and [[lubrication]] of biological systems especially human joints such as hips and knees.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biotribology|last1=Davim|first1=J. Paulo|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-61705-2}}</ref> In general, these processes are studied in the context of [[Contact mechanics]] and [[tribology]]. \n\nWhen two surfaces rub against each other, the effect of that rubbing on either surface will depend on friction, wear and lubrication at the point of contact. For example, the femoral and tibial components of knee implants routinely rub against each other during daily activity such as walking or stair climbing. If the performance of the tibial component needs to be analyzed, the principles of contact mechanics and tribology are used to determine the wear performance of the implant and the lubrication effects of synovial fluid. \n\nAdditional aspects of biotribology include analysis of subsurface damage resulting from two surfaces coming in contact during motion, i.e. rubbing against each other, such as in the evaluation of tissue-engineered cartilage.<ref name=\"Whitney, G.

Common areas of investigation are [[Animal locomotion]] and [[List of feeding behaviours|feeding]], as these have strong connections to the organism's [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] and impose high mechanical demands. Animal locomotion, has many manifestations, including [[running]], [[jumping]] and [[Flying and gliding animals|flying]]. Locomotion requires [[energy]] to overcome [[friction]], [[drag (physics)|drag]], [[inertia]], and [[gravity]], though which factor predominates varies with environment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nComparative biomechanics overlaps strongly with many other fields, including [[ecology]], [[neurobiology]], [[developmental biology]], [[ethology]], and [[paleontology]], to the extent of commonly publishing papers in the journals of these other fields. Comparative biomechanics is often applied in medicine (with regards to common model organisms such as mice and rats) as well as in [[Biomimicry|biomimetics]], which looks to nature for solutions to engineering problems.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Computational biomechanics ===\nComputational biomechanics is the application of engineering computational tools, such as the [[Finite element method]] to study the mechanics of biological systems. Computational models and simulations are used to predict the relationship between parameters that are otherwise challenging to test experimentally, or used to design more relevant experiments reducing the time and costs of experiments. Mechanical modeling using finite element analysis has been used to interpret the experimental observation of plant cell growth to understand how they differentiate, for instance.<ref name=\"Bidhendi2018\" /> In medicine, over the past decade, the [[Finite element method]] has become an established alternative to [[in vivo]] surgical assessment. One of the main advantages of computational biomechanics lies in its ability to determine the endo-anatomical response of an anatomy, without being subject to ethical restrictions.<ref>Tsouknidas, A., Savvakis, S., Asaniotis, Y., Anagnostidis, K., Lontos, A., Michailidis, N. (2013) The effect of kyphoplasty parameters on the dynamic load transfer within the lumbar spine considering the response of a bio-realistic spine segment. Clinical Biomechanics 28 (9\u201310), pp. 949\u2013955.</ref> This has led FE modeling to the point of becoming ubiquitous in several fields of Biomechanics while several projects have even adopted an open source philosophy (e.g. BioSpine).\n\n=== Continuum biomechanics ===\nThe mechanical analysis of [[biomaterial]]s and biofluids is usually carried forth with the concepts of [[continuum mechanics]]. This assumption breaks down when the [[length scale]]s of interest approach the order of the micro structural details of the material. One of the most remarkable characteristic of biomaterials is their [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] structure. In other words, the mechanical characteristics of these materials rely on physical phenomena occurring in multiple levels, from the [[molecular]] all the way up to the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] levels.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nBiomaterials are classified in two groups, hard and [[soft tissues]]. Mechanical deformation of hard tissues (like [[wood]], [[Seashell|shell]] and [[bone]]) may be analysed with the theory of [[linear elasticity]]. On the other hand, soft tissues (like [[skin]], [[tendon]], [[muscle]] and [[cartilage]]) usually undergo large deformations and thus their analysis rely on the [[finite strain theory]] and [[computer simulation]]s. The interest in continuum biomechanics is spurred by the need for realism in the development of medical simulation.<ref name=\"Fung\">{{harvnb|Fung|1993|}}</ref>{{rp|568}}\n\n=== Plant biomechanics ===\nThe application of biomechanical principles to plants, plant organs and cells has developed into the subfield of plant biomechanics.<ref name=\"Niklas\">{{cite book | last=Niklas | first=Karl J. | authorlink= | title=Plant Biomechanics: An Engineering Approach to Plant Form and Function | url=https://archive.org/details/plantbiomechanic0000nikl/page/622 | url-access=registration | publisher=University Of Chicago Press | edition=1 | year=1992 | location=New York, NY | page=[https://archive.org/details/plantbiomechanic0000nikl/page/622 622] | isbn=978-0-226-58631-1 }}</ref> Application of biomechanics for plants ranges from studying the resilience of crops to environmental stress<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Forell | first1 = G.

[[Galen]] (129 AD-210 AD), physician to [[Marcus Aurelius]], wrote his famous work, On the Function of the Parts (about the human body). This would be the world's standard medical book for the next 1,400 years.<ref name=\"asbweb.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.asbweb.org/about-biomechanics/the-original-biomechanists/|title=American Society of Biomechanics \u00bb The Original Biomechanists|website=www.asbweb.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref>\n\n=== Renaissance ===\n\n<!--[[Galen]] (129 AD \u2013 210 AD), physician to Marcus Aurelius, wrote his famous work, ''On the Function of the Parts'' (about the human body). This would be the world's standard medical book for the next 1,400 years.--><!--so how is that biomech?-->\nThe next major biomechanic would not be around until 1452, with the birth of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Da Vinci was an artist and mechanic and engineer. He contributed to mechanics and military and civil engineering projects. He had a great understanding of science and mechanics and studied anatomy in a mechanics context. He analyzed muscle forces and movements and studied joint functions. These studies could be considered studies in the realm of biomechanics. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] studied anatomy in the context of mechanics. He analyzed muscle forces as acting along lines connecting origins and insertions, and studied joint function. Da Vinci tended to mimic some animal features in his machines. For example, he studied the flight of birds to find means by which humans could fly; and because horses were the principal source of mechanical power in that time, he studied their muscular systems to design machines that would better benefit from the forces applied by this animal.<ref name=\"Mason\">{{cite book|title=A History of the Sciences |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofscience00maso |url-access=registration |last=Mason|first=Stephen |publisher=Collier Books|year=1962|isbn=|location=New York, NY|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofscience00maso/page/550 550]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1543, Galen's work, On the Function of the Parts was challenged by [[Andreas Vesalius]] at the age of 29. Vesalius published his own work called, On the Structure of the Human Body. In this work, Vesalius corrected many errors made by Galen, which would not be globally accepted for many centuries. With the death of Copernicus came a new desire to understand and learn about the world around people and how it works. On his deathbed, he published his work, On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres. This work not only revolutionized science and physics, but also the development of mechanics and later bio-mechanics.<ref name=\"asbweb.org\"/>\n\n[[Galileo Galilei]], the father of mechanics and part time biomechanic was born 21 years after the death of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]]. Galileo spent many years in medical school and often questioned everything his professors taught. He found that the professors could not prove what they taught so he moved onto mathematics where everything had to be proven. Then, at the age of 25, he went to Pisa and taught mathematics. He was a very good lecturer and students would leave their other instructors to hear him speak, so he was forced to resign. He then became a professor at an even more prestigious school in [[Padua]]. His spirit and teachings would lead the world once again in the direction of science. Over his years of science, Galileo made a lot of biomechanical aspects known. For example, he discovered that &nbsp;\"animals' masses increase disproportionately to their size, and their bones must consequently also disproportionately increase in girth, adapting to loadbearing rather than mere size. The bending strength of a tubular structure such as a bone is increased relative to its weight by making it hollow and increasing its diameter. Marine animals can be larger than terrestrial animals because the water's bouyancy [sic] relieves their tissues of weight.\"<ref name=\"asbweb.org\"/>\n\n[[Galileo Galilei]] was interested in the strength of bones and suggested that bones are hollow because this affords maximum strength with minimum weight. He noted that animals' bone masses increased disproportionately to their size. Consequently, bones must also increase disproportionately in girth rather than mere size. This is because the bending strength of a tubular structure (such as a bone) is much more efficient relative to its weight. Mason suggests that this insight was one of the first grasps of the principles of [[Engineering optimization|biological optimization]].<ref name=\"Mason\" />\n\nIn the 16th century, [[Descartes]] suggested a philosophic system whereby all living systems, including the human body (but not the soul), are simply machines ruled by the same mechanical laws, an idea that did much to promote and sustain biomechanical study. \n\n=== Industrial era ===\nThe next major bio-mechanic, [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli]], embraced Descartes' mechanical philosophy and studied walking, running, jumping, the flight of birds, the swimming of fish, and even the piston action of the heart within a mechanical framework. He could determine the position of the human [[center of gravity]], calculate and measure inspired and expired air volumes, and he showed that inspiration is muscle-driven and expiration is due to tissue elasticity. \n\nBorelli was the first to understand that \u201cthe levers of the musculature system magnify motion rather than force, so that muscles must produce much larger forces than those resisting the motion\u201d.<ref name=\"asbweb.org\" />  Influenced by the work of Galileo, whom he personally knew, he had an intuitive understanding of static equilibrium in various joints of the human body well before [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] published the laws of motion.<ref name=\"Humphrey\">{{cite journal|author=Humphrey, Jay D.|year=2003|title=Continuum biomechanics of soft biological tissues|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A|volume=459|issue=2029|pages=3\u201346|bibcode=2003RSPSA.459....3H|doi=10.1098/rspa.2002.1060|editor=The Royal Society}}</ref> His work is often considered the most important  in the history of bio-mechanics because he made so many new discoveries that opened the way for the future generations to continue his work and studies.\n\nIt was many years after Borelli before the field of bio-mechanics made any major leaps. After that time, more and more scientists took to learning about the human body and its functions. There are not many notable scientists from the 19th or 20th century in bio-mechanics because the field is far too vast now to attribute one thing to one person. However, the field is continuing to grow every year and continues to make advances in discovering more about the human body. Because the field became so popular, many institutions and labs have opened over the last century and people continue doing research. With the Creation of the American Society of Bio-mechanics in 1977, the field continues to grow and make many new discoveries.<ref name=\"asbweb.org\"/>\n\nIn the 19th century [[\u00c9tienne-Jules Marey]] used [[cinematography]] to scientifically investigate [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. He opened the field of modern 'motion analysis' by being the first to correlate ground reaction forces with movement. In Germany, the brothers [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] hypothesized a great deal about human gait, but it was [[Christian Wilhelm Braune]] who significantly advanced the science using recent advances in engineering mechanics. During the same period, the engineering [[mechanics of materials]] began to flourish in France and Germany under the demands of the [[industrial revolution]]. This led to the rebirth of bone biomechanics when the [[railroad engineer]] [[Karl Culmann]] and the anatomist [[Hermann von Meyer]] compared the stress patterns in a human femur with those in a similarly shaped crane. Inspired by this finding [[Julius Wolff (surgeon)|Julius Wolff]] proposed the famous [[Wolff's law]] of [[bone remodeling]].<ref>{{cite web\n |author=R.

An often studied liquid biofluid problem is that of blood flow in the human cardiovascular system. Under certain mathematical circumstances, [[blood]] flow can be modeled by the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equations]]. ''In vivo'' [[whole blood]] is assumed to be an incompressible [[Newtonian fluid]]. However, this assumption fails when considering forward flow within [[arterioles]]. At the microscopic scale, the effects of individual [[red blood cells]] become significant, and whole blood can no longer be modeled as a continuum. When the diameter of the blood vessel is just slightly larger than the diameter of the red blood cell the [[Fahraeus\u2013Lindquist effect]] occurs and there is a decrease in wall [[shear stress]]. However, as the diameter of the blood vessel decreases further, the red blood cells have to squeeze through the vessel and often can only pass in a single file. In this case, the inverse Fahraeus\u2013Lindquist effect occurs and the wall shear stress increases.\n\nAn example of a gaseous biofluids problem is that of human respiration. Recently, respiratory systems in insects have been studied for [[bioinspiration]] for designing improved microfluidic devices.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Aboelkassem | first1=Yasser | year=2013 | title=Selective pumping in a network: insect-style microscale flow transport | journal=Bioinspiration & Biomimetics | volume=8 | issue=2 | pages=026004 | doi=10.1088/1748-3182/8/2/026004| pmid=23538838 |bibcode=2013BiBi....8b6004A }}</ref>\n\n=== Biotribology ===\nBiotribology is the study of [[friction]], [[wear]] and [[lubrication]] of biological systems especially human joints such as hips and knees.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biotribology|last1=Davim|first1=J. Paulo|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-61705-2}}</ref> In general, these processes are studied in the context of [[Contact mechanics]] and [[tribology]]. \n\nWhen two surfaces rub against each other, the effect of that rubbing on either surface will depend on friction, wear and lubrication at the point of contact. For example, the femoral and tibial components of knee implants routinely rub against each other during daily activity such as walking or stair climbing. If the performance of the tibial component needs to be analyzed, the principles of contact mechanics and tribology are used to determine the wear performance of the implant and the lubrication effects of synovial fluid. \n\nAdditional aspects of biotribology include analysis of subsurface damage resulting from two surfaces coming in contact during motion, i.e. rubbing against each other, such as in the evaluation of tissue-engineered cartilage.<ref name=\"Whitney, G. A. 2014\">Whitney, G. A., Jayaraman, K., Dennis, J. E. and Mansour, J. M. (2014), Scaffold-free cartilage subjected to frictional shear stress demonstrates damage by cracking and surface peeling.

Common areas of investigation are [[Animal locomotion]] and [[List of feeding behaviours|feeding]], as these have strong connections to the organism's [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] and impose high mechanical demands. Animal locomotion, has many manifestations, including [[running]], [[jumping]] and [[Flying and gliding animals|flying]]. Locomotion requires [[energy]] to overcome [[friction]], [[drag (physics)|drag]], [[inertia]], and [[gravity]], though which factor predominates varies with environment.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nComparative biomechanics overlaps strongly with many other fields, including [[ecology]], [[neurobiology]], [[developmental biology]], [[ethology]], and [[paleontology]], to the extent of commonly publishing papers in the journals of these other fields. Comparative biomechanics is often applied in medicine (with regards to common model organisms such as mice and rats) as well as in [[Biomimicry|biomimetics]], which looks to nature for solutions to engineering problems.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Computational biomechanics ===\nComputational biomechanics is the application of engineering computational tools, such as the [[Finite element method]] to study the mechanics of biological systems. Computational models and simulations are used to predict the relationship between parameters that are otherwise challenging to test experimentally, or used to design more relevant experiments reducing the time and costs of experiments. Mechanical modeling using finite element analysis has been used to interpret the experimental observation of plant cell growth to understand how they differentiate, for instance.<ref name=\"Bidhendi2018\" /> In medicine, over the past decade, the [[Finite element method]] has become an established alternative to [[in vivo]] surgical assessment. One of the main advantages of computational biomechanics lies in its ability to determine the endo-anatomical response of an anatomy, without being subject to ethical restrictions.<ref>Tsouknidas, A., Savvakis, S., Asaniotis, Y., Anagnostidis, K., Lontos, A., Michailidis, N. (2013) The effect of kyphoplasty parameters on the dynamic load transfer within the lumbar spine considering the response of a bio-realistic spine segment. Clinical Biomechanics 28 (9\u201310), pp. 949\u2013955.</ref> This has led FE modeling to the point of becoming ubiquitous in several fields of Biomechanics while several projects have even adopted an open source philosophy (e.g. BioSpine).\n\n=== Continuum biomechanics ===\nThe mechanical analysis of [[biomaterial]]s and biofluids is usually carried forth with the concepts of [[continuum mechanics]]. This assumption breaks down when the [[length scale]]s of interest approach the order of the micro structural details of the material. One of the most remarkable characteristic of biomaterials is their [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] structure. In other words, the mechanical characteristics of these materials rely on physical phenomena occurring in multiple levels, from the [[molecular]] all the way up to the [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] levels.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nBiomaterials are classified in two groups, hard and [[soft tissues]]. Mechanical deformation of hard tissues (like [[wood]], [[Seashell|shell]] and [[bone]]) may be analysed with the theory of [[linear elasticity]]. On the other hand, soft tissues (like [[skin]], [[tendon]], [[muscle]] and [[cartilage]]) usually undergo large deformations and thus their analysis rely on the [[finite strain theory]] and [[computer simulation]]s. The interest in continuum biomechanics is spurred by the need for realism in the development of medical simulation.<ref name=\"Fung\">{{harvnb|Fung|1993|}}</ref>{{rp|568}}\n\n=== Plant biomechanics ===\nThe application of biomechanical principles to plants, plant organs and cells has developed into the subfield of plant biomechanics.<ref name=\"Niklas\">{{cite book | last=Niklas | first=Karl J. | authorlink= | title=Plant Biomechanics: An Engineering Approach to Plant Form and Function | url=https://archive.org/details/plantbiomechanic0000nikl/page/622 | url-access=registration | publisher=University Of Chicago Press | edition=1 | year=1992 | location=New York, NY | page=[https://archive.org/details/plantbiomechanic0000nikl/page/622 622] | isbn=978-0-226-58631-1 }}</ref> Application of biomechanics for plants ranges from studying the resilience of crops to environmental stress<ref>Forell, G.

This would be the world's standard medical book for the next 1,400 years.--><!--so how is that biomech?-->\nThe next major biomechanic would not be around until 1452, with the birth of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Da Vinci was an artist and mechanic and engineer. He contributed to mechanics and military and civil engineering projects. He had a great understanding of science and mechanics and studied anatomy in a mechanics context. He analyzed muscle forces and movements and studied joint functions. These studies could be considered studies in the realm of biomechanics. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] studied anatomy in the context of mechanics. He analyzed muscle forces as acting along lines connecting origins and insertions, and studied joint function. Da Vinci tended to mimic some animal features in his machines. For example, he studied the flight of birds to find means by which humans could fly; and because horses were the principal source of mechanical power in that time, he studied their muscular systems to design machines that would better benefit from the forces applied by this animal.<ref name=\"Mason\">{{cite book|title=A History of the Sciences |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofscience00maso |url-access=registration |last=Mason|first=Stephen |publisher=Collier Books|year=1962|isbn=|location=New York, NY|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofscience00maso/page/550 550]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1543, Galen's work, On the Function of the Parts was challenged by [[Andreas Vesalius]] at the age of 29. Vesalius published his own work called, On the Structure of the Human Body. In this work, Vesalius corrected many errors made by Galen, which would not be globally accepted for many centuries. With the death of Copernicus came a new desire to understand and learn about the world around people and how it works. On his deathbed, he published his work, On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres. This work not only revolutionized science and physics, but also the development of mechanics and later bio-mechanics.<ref name=\"asbweb.org\"/>\n\n[[Galileo Galilei]], the father of mechanics and part time biomechanic was born 21 years after the death of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]]. Galileo spent many years in medical school and often questioned everything his professors taught. He found that the professors could not prove what they taught so he moved onto mathematics where everything had to be proven. Then, at the age of 25, he went to Pisa and taught mathematics. He was a very good lecturer and students would leave their other instructors to hear him speak, so he was forced to resign. He then became a professor at an even more prestigious school in [[Padua]]. His spirit and teachings would lead the world once again in the direction of science. Over his years of science, Galileo made a lot of biomechanical aspects known. For example, he discovered that &nbsp;\"animals' masses increase disproportionately to their size, and their bones must consequently also disproportionately increase in girth, adapting to loadbearing rather than mere size. The bending strength of a tubular structure such as a bone is increased relative to its weight by making it hollow and increasing its diameter. Marine animals can be larger than terrestrial animals because the water's bouyancy [sic] relieves their tissues of weight.\"<ref name=\"asbweb.org\"/>\n\n[[Galileo Galilei]] was interested in the strength of bones and suggested that bones are hollow because this affords maximum strength with minimum weight. He noted that animals' bone masses increased disproportionately to their size. Consequently, bones must also increase disproportionately in girth rather than mere size. This is because the bending strength of a tubular structure (such as a bone) is much more efficient relative to its weight. Mason suggests that this insight was one of the first grasps of the principles of [[Engineering optimization|biological optimization]].<ref name=\"Mason\" />\n\nIn the 16th century, [[Descartes]] suggested a philosophic system whereby all living systems, including the human body (but not the soul), are simply machines ruled by the same mechanical laws, an idea that did much to promote and sustain biomechanical study. \n\n=== Industrial era ===\nThe next major bio-mechanic, [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli]], embraced Descartes' mechanical philosophy and studied walking, running, jumping, the flight of birds, the swimming of fish, and even the piston action of the heart within a mechanical framework. He could determine the position of the human [[center of gravity]], calculate and measure inspired and expired air volumes, and he showed that inspiration is muscle-driven and expiration is due to tissue elasticity. \n\nBorelli was the first to understand that \u201cthe levers of the musculature system magnify motion rather than force, so that muscles must produce much larger forces than those resisting the motion\u201d.<ref name=\"asbweb.org\" />  Influenced by the work of Galileo, whom he personally knew, he had an intuitive understanding of static equilibrium in various joints of the human body well before [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] published the laws of motion.<ref name=\"Humphrey\">{{cite journal|author=Humphrey, Jay D.|year=2003|title=Continuum biomechanics of soft biological tissues|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A|volume=459|issue=2029|pages=3\u201346|bibcode=2003RSPSA.459....3H|doi=10.1098/rspa.2002.1060|editor=The Royal Society}}</ref> His work is often considered the most important  in the history of bio-mechanics because he made so many new discoveries that opened the way for the future generations to continue his work and studies.\n\nIt was many years after Borelli before the field of bio-mechanics made any major leaps. After that time, more and more scientists took to learning about the human body and its functions. There are not many notable scientists from the 19th or 20th century in bio-mechanics because the field is far too vast now to attribute one thing to one person. However, the field is continuing to grow every year and continues to make advances in discovering more about the human body. Because the field became so popular, many institutions and labs have opened over the last century and people continue doing research. With the Creation of the American Society of Bio-mechanics in 1977, the field continues to grow and make many new discoveries.<ref name=\"asbweb.org\"/>\n\nIn the 19th century [[\u00c9tienne-Jules Marey]] used [[cinematography]] to scientifically investigate [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. He opened the field of modern 'motion analysis' by being the first to correlate ground reaction forces with movement. In Germany, the brothers [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]] hypothesized a great deal about human gait, but it was [[Christian Wilhelm Braune]] who significantly advanced the science using recent advances in engineering mechanics. During the same period, the engineering [[mechanics of materials]] began to flourish in France and Germany under the demands of the [[industrial revolution]]. This led to the rebirth of bone biomechanics when the [[railroad engineer]] [[Karl Culmann]] and the anatomist [[Hermann von Meyer]] compared the stress patterns in a human femur with those in a similarly shaped crane. Inspired by this finding [[Julius Wolff (surgeon)|Julius Wolff]] proposed the famous [[Wolff's law]] of [[bone remodeling]].<ref>{{cite web\n |author=R.

There have been many different attempts at constructing an ideal theory of [[gravity]].<ref name=\"Clifton\">{{cite journal | first =Timothy|last=Clifton|author2=Pedro G. Ferreira|author3=Antonio Padilla|author4=Constantinos Skordis|title=Modified Gravity and Cosmology|journal=Physics Reports|volume=513 num.3|issue=1|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2012.01.001|pages=1\u2013189|arxiv=1106.2476|bibcode=2012PhR...513....1C}}</ref>\n\nThese attempts can be split into four broad categories based on their scope. In this article, we discuss straightforward alternatives to general relativity, which do not involve quantum mechanics or force unification. Other theories which do attempt to construct a theory using the principles of quantum mechanics are known as theories of [[Quantum gravity|quantized gravity]]. Thirdly, there are theories which attempt to explain gravity and other forces at the same time; these are known as [[classical unified field theories]]. Finally, the most ambitious theories attempt to both put gravity in quantum mechanical terms and unify forces; these are called [[theory of everything|theories of everything]].\n\nNone of these alternatives to general relativity have gained wide acceptance. Despite many [[tests of general relativity]], general relativity has remained consistent with all observations so far. In contrast, many of the early alternatives have been definitively disproven. However, some of the alternative theories of gravity are supported by a minority of physicists, and the topic remains the subject of intense study in [[theoretical physics]].\n\n==History of gravitational theory through general relativity==\n{{Main|History of gravitational theory|History of general relativity}}\n\nEarly theories of gravity attempted to explain planetary orbits ([[Newtonian gravity|Newton]]) and more complicated orbits (e.g. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]). Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity. At the same time, experimental physicists started testing the foundations of gravity and relativity \u2013 [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]], the [[Tests of general relativity|gravitational deflection of light]], the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]. These considerations led to and past the development of [[general relativity]].\n\n===Newtonian gravity===\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation|Gauss's law for gravity}}\nIn Newton's theory<ref>{{cite book|last=Newton|first=I.|author-link=Isaac Newton|year=1686|title=[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]|language=la}}</ref> (rewritten using more modern mathematics) the density of mass <math>\\rho\\,</math> generates a scalar field, the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi\\,</math> in joules per kilogram, by\n:<math>{\\partial^2 \\varphi \\over \\partial x^j \\, \\partial x^j} = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nUsing the [[Nabla operator]] <math>\\nabla</math> for the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]] (partial derivatives), this can be conveniently written as:\n:<math>\\nabla^2 \\varphi = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nThis scalar field governs the motion of a [[free-fall]]ing particle by:\n:<math>{ d^2x^j\\over dt^2} = -{\\partial\\varphi\\over\\partial x^j\\,}.</math>\n\nAt distance ''r'' from an isolated mass ''M'', the scalar field is\n:<math>\\varphi = -\\frac{GM} r \\,.</math>\n\nThe [[Newtonian gravity|theory of Newton]], and Lagrange's improvement on the calculation (applying the variational principle), completely fails to take into account relativistic effects of course, and so can be rejected as a viable theory of gravity. Even so, Newton's theory is thought to be exactly correct in the limit of weak gravitational fields and low speeds and all other theories of gravity need to reproduce Newton's theory in the appropriate limits.\n\n===Mechanical explanations (1650\u20131900)===\nTo explain Newton's theory, some [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]] (including [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's theory]]) were created between 1650 and 1900, but they were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which is not observed. Other models are violating the [[energy conservation law]] and are incompatible with modern [[thermodynamics]].\n\n===Electrostatic models (1870\u20131900)===\nAt the end of the 19th century, many tried to combine Newton's force law with the established laws of electrodynamics, like those of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Those models were used to explain the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|perihelion advance of Mercury]]. In 1890, L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt, [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the Perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypothesis were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zenneck, J. |authorlink=Jonathan Zenneck |title=Gravitation |journal=Encyklop\u00e4die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen |date=1903 |volume=5 |pages=25\u201367 |language=German |doi=10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 |isbn=978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref> In 1900, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] tried to explain gravity on the basis of his [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the [[Maxwell equations]].

The resulting net force is exactly what is known as universal gravitation, in which the speed of gravity is that of light.

Nordstr\u00f6m's theories, on the other hand, are scalar theories because the gravitational field is a scalar. Later in this article you will see scalar-tensor theories that contain a scalar field in addition to the tensors of general relativity, and other variants containing vector fields as well have been developed recently.\n\n== Motivations ==\nAfter general relativity, attempts were made either to improve on theories developed before general relativity, or to improve general relativity itself. Many different strategies were attempted, for example the addition of spin to general relativity, combining a general relativity-like metric with a spacetime that is static with respect to the expansion of the universe, getting extra freedom by adding another parameter. At least one theory was motivated by the desire to develop an alternative to general relativity that is free of singularities.\n\nExperimental tests improved along with the theories. Many of the different strategies that were developed soon after general relativity were abandoned, and there was a push to develop more general forms of the theories that survived, so that a theory would be ready when any test showed a disagreement with general relativity.\n\nBy the 1980s, the increasing accuracy of experimental tests had all confirmed general relativity; no competitors were left except for those that included general relativity as a special case. Further, shortly after that, theorists switched to string theory which was starting to look promising, but has since lost popularity. In the mid-1980s a few experiments were suggesting that gravity was being modified by the addition of a fifth force (or, in one case, of a fifth, sixth and seventh force) acting in the range of a few meters. Subsequent experiments eliminated these.\n\nMotivations for the more recent alternative theories are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"[[Cosmic inflation|inflation]]\", \"[[dark matter]]\" and \"[[dark energy]]\". Investigation of the [[Pioneer anomaly]] has caused renewed public interest in alternatives to general relativity.\n\n== Notation in this article ==\n{{Main|Mathematics of general relativity|Ricci calculus}}\n\n<math>c\\;</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>G\\;</math> is the [[gravitational constant]]. \"[[Natural units|Geometric variables]]\" are not used.\n\nLatin indices go from 1 to 3, Greek indices go from 0 to 3.

[[Covariant differentiation]] is written <math>\\nabla_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{;\\mu}\\;</math>.\n\n== Classification of theories ==\nTheories of gravity can be classified, loosely, into several categories. Most of the theories described here have:\n* an '[[Action (physics)|action]]' (see the [[principle of least action]], a [[variational principle]] based on the concept of action)\n* a [[Lagrangian density]]\n* a [[metric tensor|metric]]\n\nIf a theory has a Lagrangian density for gravity, say <math>L\\,</math>, then the gravitational part of the action <math>S\\,</math> is the integral of that:\n:<math>S = \\int L \\sqrt{-g} \\, \\mathrm{d}^4x </math>\n\nIn this equation it is usual, though not essential, to have <math>g = -1\\,</math> at spatial infinity when using Cartesian coordinates. For example, the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] uses\n:<math>L\\,\\propto\\, R </math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], a measure of the curvature of space.\n\nAlmost every theory described in this article has an [[Action (physics)|action]]. It is the only known way to guarantee that the necessary conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum are incorporated automatically; although it is easy to construct an action where those conservation laws are violated. The original 1983 version of [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]] did not have an action.\n\nA few theories have an action but not a Lagrangian density. A good example is Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922>Whitehead, A.N. (1922) ''The Principles of Relativity'', Cambridge Univ. Press</ref>, the action there is termed non-local.\n\nA theory of gravity is a \"metric theory\" if and only if it can be given a mathematical representation in which two conditions hold:<br />\n''Condition 1'': There exists a symmetric [[metric tensor]] <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math> of [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212, +, +, +), which governs proper-length and proper-time measurements in the usual manner of special and general relativity:\n\n:<math>{d\\tau}^2 = - g_{\\mu \\nu} \\, dx^\\mu \\, dx^\\nu \\,</math>\n\nwhere there is a summation over indices <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\nu</math>.<br />\n''Condition 2'': Stressed matter and fields being acted upon by gravity respond in accordance with the equation:\n\n:<math>0 = \\nabla_\\nu T^{\\mu \\nu} = {T^{\\mu \\nu}}_{,\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\sigma \\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\mu \\sigma} \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T^{\\mu \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] for all matter and non-gravitational fields, and where <math>\\nabla_{\\nu}</math> is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the metric and <math>\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\sigma \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]].

How to add a [[#Cosmological constant and quintessence|cosmological constant or quintessence]] to a theory is discussed under Modern Theories (see also [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]]).\n\n=== Scalar field theories ===\n{{See also|Scalar theories of gravitation}}\n\nThe scalar field theories of Nordstr\u00f6m<ref name=Nordstr\u00f6m1912 /><ref name=Nordstr\u00f6m1913 /> have already been discussed.

Given that variable c and zero deflection of light are both in conflict with experiment, the prospect for a successful scalar theory of gravity looks very unlikely. Further, if the parameters of a scalar theory are adjusted so that the deflection of light is correct then the gravitational redshift is likely to be wrong.\n\nNi<ref name=Ni1972 /> summarised some theories and also created two more. In the first, a pre-existing special relativity space-time and universal time coordinate acts with matter and non-gravitational fields to generate a scalar field.  This scalar field acts together with all the rest to generate the metric.\n\nThe action is:\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4 x \\sqrt{-g}L_\\varphi+S_m</math>\n\n: <math>L_\\varphi=\\varphi R-2g^{\\mu\\nu} \\, \\partial_\\mu\\varphi \\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi</math>\n\nMisner et al.<ref name=Misner1973>Misner, C.

This theory is self-consistent and complete. But the motion of the solar system through the universe leads to serious disagreement with experiment.\n\nIn the second theory of Ni<ref name=Ni1972 /> there are two arbitrary functions <math>f(\\varphi)</math> and <math>k(\\varphi)</math> that are related to the metric by:\n\n: <math>ds^2=e^{-2f(\\varphi)}dt^2-e^{2f(\\varphi)} \\left [dx^2+dy^2+dz^2 \\right ]</math>\n\n: <math>\\eta^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_\\mu\\partial_\\nu\\varphi=4\\pi\\rho^*k(\\varphi)</math>\n\nNi<ref name=Ni1972 /> quotes Rosen<ref name=Rosen1971 /> as having two scalar fields <math>\\varphi</math> and <math>\\psi</math> that are related to the metric by:\n\n: <math>ds^2=\\varphi^2 \\, dt^2-\\psi^2 \\left [dx^2+dy^2+dz^2 \\right ]</math>\n\nIn Papapetrou<ref name=Papapetrou1954a /> the gravitational part of the Lagrangian is:\n\n:<math>L_\\varphi=e^\\varphi \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2} e^{-\\varphi} \\, \\partial_\\alpha \\varphi \\, \\partial_\\alpha\\varphi + \\tfrac{3}{2} e^{\\varphi} \\, \\partial_0\\varphi \\, \\partial_0\\varphi \\right )</math>\n\nIn Papapetrou<ref name=Papapetrou1954b /> there is a second scalar field <math>\\chi</math>.

The status of Cartan's theory is uncertain. Will<ref name=Will1981 /> claims that all non-metric theories are eliminated by Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Will (2001) tempers that by explaining experimental criteria for testing non-metric theories against Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> claims that Cartan's theory is the only non-metric theory to survive all experimental tests up to that date and Turyshev<ref name=Turyshev2006>Turyshev, S. G. (2006) Testing gravity in the solar system, http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~hz4/workshop/workshopppt/turyshev.pdf</ref> lists Cartan's theory among the few that have survived all experimental tests up to that date. The following is a quick sketch of Cartan's theory as restated by Trautman.<ref name=Trautman1972>Trautman, A. (1972) On the Einstein\u2013Cartan equations I, Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Sciences 20, 185-190</ref>\n\nCartan<ref name=Cartan1922 /><ref name=Cartan1923 /> suggested a simple generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. He proposed a model of space time with a metric tensor and a linear \"connection\" compatible with the metric but not necessarily symmetric. The torsion tensor of the connection is related to the density of intrinsic angular momentum. Independently of Cartan, similar ideas were put forward by Sciama, by Kibble in the years 1958 to 1966, culminating in a 1976 review by Hehl et al.\n\nThe original description is in terms of differential forms, but for the present article that is replaced by the more familiar language of tensors (risking loss of accuracy). As in general relativity, the Lagrangian is made up of a massless and a mass part. The Lagrangian for the massless part is:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nL & ={1\\over 32\\pi G}\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu g^{\\nu\\xi}x^\\eta x^\\zeta \\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu & =d \\omega^\\mu_\\nu + \\omega^\\eta_\\xi \\\\[5pt]\n\\nabla x^\\mu & =-\\omega^\\mu_\\nu x^\\nu\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe <math>\\omega^\\mu_\\nu\\;</math> is the linear connection. <math>\\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta}\\;</math> is the completely antisymmetric pseudo-tensor ([[Levi-Civita symbol]]) with <math>\\varepsilon_{0123}=\\sqrt{-g}\\;</math>, and <math>g^{\\nu\\xi}\\,</math> is the metric tensor as usual. By assuming that the linear connection is metric, it is possible to remove the unwanted freedom inherent in the non-metric theory. The stress\u2013energy tensor is calculated from:\n\n:<math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 16\\pi G} (g^{\\mu\\nu}\\eta^\\xi_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\mu}\\eta^\\nu_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\nu} \\eta^\\mu_\\eta) \\Omega^\\eta_\\xi\\;</math>\n\nThe space curvature is not Riemannian, but on a Riemannian space-time the Lagrangian would reduce to the Lagrangian of general relativity.\n\nSome equations of the non-metric theory of Belinfante and Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> have already been discussed in the section on [[#Bimetric theories|bimetric theories]].\n\nA distinctively non-metric theory is given by [[gauge theory gravity]], which replaces the metric in its field equations with a pair of gauge fields in flat spacetime.  On the one hand, the theory is quite conservative because it is substantially equivalent to Einstein\u2013Cartan theory (or general relativity in the limit of vanishing spin), differing mostly in the nature of its global solutions.  On the other hand, it is radical because it replaces differential geometry with [[geometric algebra]].\n\n== Modern theories 1980s to present ==\nThis section includes alternatives to general relativity published after the observations of galaxy rotation that led to the hypothesis of \"dark matter\". There is no known reliable list of comparison of these theories.

These theories are presented with a cosmological constant or added scalar or vector potential.\n\n=== Motivations ===\nMotivations for the more recent alternatives to general relativity are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"inflation\", \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\". The basic idea is that gravity agrees with general relativity at the present epoch but may have been quite different in the early universe.\n\nThere was a slow dawning realisation in the physics world that there were several problems inherent in the then big bang scenario, two of these were the [[horizon problem]] and the observation that at early times when quarks were first forming there was not enough space on the universe to contain even one quark. Inflation theory was developed to overcome these. Another alternative was constructing an alternative to general relativity in which the speed of light was larger in the early universe. The discovery of unexpected rotation curves for galaxies took everyone by surprise. Could there be more mass in the universe than we are aware of, or is the theory of gravity itself wrong? The consensus now is that the missing mass is \"cold dark matter\", but that consensus was only reached after trying alternatives to general relativity and some physicists still believe that alternative models of gravity might hold the answer.\n\nIn the 1990s, supernova surveys discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe, usually attributed to [[dark energy]]. This led to the rapid reinstatement of Einstein's cosmological constant, and quintessence arrived as an alternative to the cosmological constant. At least one new alternative to general relativity attempted to explain the supernova surveys' results in a completely different way. The measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] ruled out many alternative theories of gravity as explanation for the accelerated expansion.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |journal=Physics Letters B|volume=765|pages=382\u2013385|first1=Lucas|last1=Lombriser |first2=Nelson|last2=Lima |arxiv=1602.07670 |year=2017|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2016.12.048|bibcode=2017PhLB..765..382L}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-02-quest-riddle-einstein-theory.html|title=Quest to settle riddle over Einstein's theory may soon be over|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|website=[[phys.org]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/science/2017/02/theoretical-battle-dark-energy-vs-modified-gravity/|title=Theoretical battle: Dark energy vs. modified gravity|date=February 25, 2017|access-date=October 27, 2017|website=[[Ars Technica]]|author=Xaq Rzetelny}}</ref> Another observation that sparked recent interest in alternatives to General Relativity is the [[Pioneer anomaly]]. It was quickly discovered that alternatives to general relativity could explain this anomaly. This is now believed to be accounted for by non-uniform thermal radiation.\n\n=== Cosmological constant and quintessence ===\n{{see also|Cosmological constant|Einstein\u2013Hilbert action|Quintessence (physics)}}\n\nThe cosmological constant <math>\\Lambda\\;</math> is a very old idea, going back to Einstein in 1917.<ref name=Einstein1917 /> The success of the Friedmann model of the universe in which <math>\\Lambda=0\\;</math> led to the general acceptance that it is zero, but the use of a non-zero value came back with a vengeance when data from supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating\n\nFirst, let's see how it influences the equations of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity. In Newtonian gravity, the addition of the cosmological constant changes the Newton\u2013Poisson equation from:\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi=4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi + \\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda c^2 = 4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nIn general relativity, it changes the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action from\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int R\\sqrt{-g} \\, d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int (R-2\\Lambda)\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nwhich changes the field equation\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G} \\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R \\right)\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G}\\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R + g^{\\mu\\nu} \\Lambda \\right)\\;</math>\n\nIn alternative theories of gravity, a cosmological constant can be added to the action in exactly the same way.\n\nThe cosmological constant is not the only way to get an accelerated expansion of the universe in alternatives to general relativity. We've already seen how the scalar potential <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> can be added to scalar tensor theories. This can also be done in every alternative the general relativity that contains a scalar field <math>\\varphi\\;</math> by adding the term <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> inside the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action, the <math>L_\\varphi\\;</math> part of\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4x \\, \\sqrt{-g} \\, L_\\varphi+S_m\\;</math>\n\nBecause <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> is an arbitrary function of the scalar field, it can be set to give an acceleration that is large in the early universe and small at the present epoch. This is known as quintessence.\n\nA similar method can be used in alternatives to general relativity that use vector fields, including Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> and vector-tensor theories. A term proportional to\n\n: <math>K^\\mu K^\\nu g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math>\n\nis added to the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action.\n\n=== Farnes' theories === \nIn December 2018, the astrophysicist [[Jamie Farnes]] from the [[University of Oxford]] proposed a [[dark fluid]] theory, related to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses that were presented earlier by [[Albert Einstein]]. The theory may help to better understand the considerable amounts of unknown [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] in the [[universe]].<ref name=\"ARX-2018\">{{cite journal |last=Farnes |first=J.S. |title=A Unifying Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Negative Masses and Matter Creation within a Modified \u039bCDM Framework |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=620 |pages=A92 |arxiv=1712.07962 |year=2018 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832898 |bibcode=2018A&A...620A..92F }}</ref>\n\nThe theory relies on the concept of [[negative mass]] and reintroduces [[Fred Hoyle]]'s creation tensor in order to allow [[matter creation]] for only negative mass particles. In this way, the negative mass particles surround galaxies and apply a pressure onto them, thereby resembling dark matter. As these hypothesised particles mutually repel one another, they push apart the Universe, thereby resembling dark energy. The creation of matter allows the density of the exotic negative mass particles to remain constant as a function of time, and so appears like a [[cosmological constant]]. Einstein's field equations are modified to:\n: <math>R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} \\left( T_{\\mu \\nu}^{+} + T_{\\mu \\nu}^{-} + C_{\\mu \\nu} \\right)</math>\n\nAccording to Occam's razor, Farnes' theory is a simpler alternative to the conventional LambdaCDM model, as both dark energy and dark matter (two hypotheses) are solved using a single negative mass fluid (one hypothesis). The theory will be directly testable using the world's largest radio telescope, the [[Square Kilometre Array]] which should come online in 2022.<ref name=\"EA-20181205\">{{cite web |author=University of Oxford |title=Bringing balance to the universe: New theory could explain missing 95 percent of the cosmos |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/uoo-bbt120318.php |date=5 December 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=6 December 2018 |author-link=University of Oxford }}</ref>\n\n=== Relativistic MOND ===\n{{main|Modified Newtonian dynamics|Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|Extended theories of gravity}}\n\nThe original theory of MOND by Milgrom was developed in 1983 as an alternative to \"dark matter\". Departures from Newton's law of gravitation are governed by an acceleration scale, not a distance scale. MOND successfully explains the Tully-Fisher observation that the luminosity of a galaxy should scale as the fourth power of the rotation speed. It also explains why the rotation discrepancy in dwarf galaxies is particularly large.\n\nThere were several problems with MOND in the beginning.\n# It did not include relativistic effects\n# It violated the conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum\n# It was inconsistent in that it gives different galactic orbits for gas and for stars\n# It did not state how to calculate gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters.\n\nBy 1984, problems 2 and 3 had been solved by introducing a Lagrangian ([[AQUAL]]). A relativistic version of this based on scalar-tensor theory was rejected because it allowed waves in the scalar field to propagate faster than light. The Lagrangian of the non-relativistic form is:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}f\\left\\lbrack \\frac{|\\nabla\\varphi|^2}{a_0^2}\\right\\rbrack-\\rho\\varphi</math>\n\nThe relativistic version of this has:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}\\tilde f \\left( \\ell_0^2 g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi \\right )</math>\n\nwith a nonstandard mass action. Here <math>f</math> and <math>\\tilde f</math> are arbitrary functions selected to give Newtonian and MOND behaviour in the correct limits, and <math>l_0 = c^2/a_0\\;</math> is the MOND length scale. By 1988, a second scalar field (PCC) fixed problems with the earlier scalar-tensor version but is in conflict with the perihelion precession of Mercury and gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters. By 1997, MOND had been successfully incorporated in a stratified relativistic theory [Sanders], but as this is a preferred frame theory it has problems of its own. Bekenstein<ref name=Bekenstein2004 /> introduced a [[Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|tensor-vector-scalar]] model (TeVeS). This has two scalar fields <math>\\varphi</math>  and <math>\\sigma\\;</math> and vector field <math>U_\\alpha</math>.

It has variable <math>G\\;</math>, increasing to a final constant value about a million years after the big bang.\n \nThe theory seems to contain an asymmetric tensor <math>A_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> field and a source current <math>J_\\mu\\;</math> vector. The action is split into:\n\n: <math>S=S_G+S_F+S_{FM}+S_M\\;</math>\n\nBoth the gravity and mass terms match those of general relativity with cosmological constant.

For in-depth coverage of these tests, see Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> Ch.39, Will <ref name=Will1981 /> Table 2.1, and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 />.  Most such tests can be categorized as in the following subsections.\n\n=== Self-consistency ===\nSelf-consistency among non-metric theories includes eliminating theories allowing [[tachyon]]s, ghost poles and higher order poles, and those that have problems with behaviour at infinity. Among metric theories, self-consistency is best illustrated by describing several theories that fail this test. The classic example is the spin-two field theory of Fierz and Pauli<ref name=Fierz1939 />); the field equations imply that gravitating bodies move in straight lines, whereas the equations of motion insist that gravity deflects bodies away from straight line motion. Yilmaz (1971)<ref name=Yilmaz1973 /> contains a tensor gravitational field used to construct a metric; it is mathematically inconsistent because the functional dependence of the metric on the tensor field is not well defined.\n\n=== Completeness ===\nTo be complete, a theory of gravity must be capable of analysing the outcome of every experiment of interest. It must therefore mesh with electromagnetism and all other physics. For instance, any theory that cannot predict from first principles the movement of planets or the behaviour of atomic clocks is incomplete.\n\nMany early theories are incomplete in that it is unclear whether the density <math>\\rho</math> used by the theory should be calculated from the stress\u2013energy tensor <math>T</math> as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu</math> or as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^{\\mu \\nu}</math>, where <math>u</math> is the [[four-velocity]], and <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. The theories of Thirry (1948) and Jordan<ref name=Jordan1955 /> are incomplete unless Jordan's parameter <math>\\eta\\;</math> is set to -1, in which case they match the theory of Brans\u2013Dicke<ref name=Brans1961 /> and so are worthy of further consideration. Milne<ref name=Milne1948 /> is incomplete because it makes no gravitational red-shift prediction. The theories of Whitrow and Morduch<ref name=Whitrow1960 /><ref name=Whitrow1965 />, Kustaanheimo<ref name=Kustaanheimo1966 /> and Kustaanheimo and Nuotio<ref name=Kustaanheimo1967 /> are either incomplete or inconsistent. The incorporation of Maxwell's equations is incomplete unless it is assumed that they are imposed on the flat background space-time, and when that is done they are inconsistent, because they predict zero gravitational redshift when the wave version of light (Maxwell theory) is used, and nonzero redshift when the particle version (photon) is used. Another more obvious example is Newtonian gravity with Maxwell's equations; light as photons is deflected by gravitational fields (by half that of general relativity) but light as waves is not.\n\n=== Classical tests ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\nThere are three \"classical\" tests (dating back to the 1910s or earlier) of the ability of gravity theories to handle relativistic effects; they are [[gravitational redshift]], [[gravitational lensing]] (generally tested around the Sun), and anomalous perihelion advance of the planets. Each theory should reproduce the observed results in these areas, which have to date always aligned with the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] found a fourth test, called the [[Shapiro delay]]. It is usually regarded as a \"classical\" test as well.\n\n=== Agreement with Newtonian mechanics and special relativity ===\nAs an example of disagreement with Newtonian experiments, Birkhoff<ref name=Birkhoff1943>{{cite journal | last1 = Birkhoff | first1 = G. D. | year = 1943 | title = Matter, electricity and gravitation in flat space-time | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A. | volume = 29 | issue = 8| pages = 231\u2013239 | doi=10.1073/pnas.29.8.231| pmid = 16578082 |bibcode = 1943PNAS...29..231B | pmc = 1078600}}</ref> theory predicts relativistic effects fairly reliably but demands that sound waves travel at the speed of light. This was the consequence of an assumption made to simplify handling the collision of masses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== The Einstein equivalence principle ===\n{{Main|Equivalence principle}}\n\nEinstein's Equivalence Principle has three components. The first is the uniqueness of free fall, also known as the Weak Equivalence Principle. This is satisfied if inertial mass is equal to gravitational mass. ''\u03b7'' is a parameter used to test the maximum allowable violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. The first tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle were done by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s before 1900 and limited ''\u03b7'' to less than 5{{e|-9}}. Modern tests have reduced that to less than 5{{e|-13}}. The second is Lorentz invariance. In the absence of gravitational effects the speed of light is constant. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b4''. The first tests of Lorentz invariance were done by Michelson and Morley before 1890 and limited ''\u03b4'' to less than 5{{e|-3}}. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-21}}. The third is local position invariance, which includes spatial and temporal invariance. The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment is independent of where and when it is performed. Spatial local position invariance is tested using gravitational redshift measurements. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b1''. Upper limits on this found by Pound and Rebka in 1960 limited ''\u03b1'' to less than 0.1. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-4}}.\n\n[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture states that any complete, self-consistent theory of gravity that embodies the Weak Equivalence Principle necessarily embodies Einstein's Equivalence Principle. This is likely to be true if the theory has full energy conservation. Metric theories satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle. Extremely few non-metric theories satisfy this. For example, the non-metric theory of Belinfante & Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> is eliminated by the ''TH\u03b5\u03bc'' formalism for testing Einstein's Equivalence Principle.  Gauge theory gravity is a notable exception, where the strong equivalence principle is essentially the [[minimal coupling]] of the [[gauge covariant derivative]].\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian formalism ===\n{{Main|Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism}}\n\nSee also [[Tests of general relativity]], Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> and Will<ref name=Will1981 /> for more information.\n\nWork on developing a standardized rather than ad-hoc set of tests for evaluating alternative gravitation models began with Eddington in 1922 and resulted in a standard set of Parametric post-Newtonian numbers in Nordtvedt and Will<ref name=Nordtvedt1972>{{cite journal | last1 = Nordtvedt Jr | first1 = K. | last2 = Will | first2 = C. M. | year = 1972 | title = Conservation laws and preferred frames in relativistic gravity II | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 177 | issue = | page = 775 | bibcode = 1972ApJ...177..775N | doi = 10.1086/151755 }}</ref> and Will and Nordtvedt<ref name=Will1972 />. Each parameter measures a different aspect of how much a theory departs from Newtonian gravity. Because we are talking about deviation from Newtonian theory here, these only measure weak-field effects. The effects of strong gravitational fields are examined later.\n\nThese ten are: <math>\\gamma, \\beta,\\eta,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3,\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4.</math>\n\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is a measure of space curvature, being zero for Newtonian gravity and one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\beta</math> is a measure of nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\eta</math> is a check for preferred location effects.\n*<math>\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of \"preferred-frame effects\". Any theory of gravity in which at least one of the three is nonzero is called a preferred-frame theory.\n*<math>\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of breakdowns in global conservation laws. A theory of gravity possesses 4 conservation laws for energy-momentum and 6 for angular momentum only if all five are zero.\n\n=== Strong gravity and gravitational waves ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nParametric post-Newtonian is only a measure of weak field effects. Strong gravity effects can be seen in compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Experimental tests such as the stability of white dwarfs, spin-down rate of pulsars, orbits of binary pulsars and the existence of a black hole horizon can be used as tests of alternative to general relativity. General relativity predicts that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Many alternatives to general relativity say that gravitational waves travel faster than light, possibly breaking of causality. After the multi-messaging detection of the GW170817 coalescence of neutron stars, where light and gravitational waves were measured to travel at the same speed with an error of 1/10<sup>15</sup>, many of those modified theory of gravity were excluded.\n\n=== Cosmological tests ===\nMany of these have been developed recently. For those theories that aim to replace [[dark matter]], the [[galaxy rotation curve]], the [[Tully-Fisher relation]], the faster rotation rate of dwarf galaxies, and the [[gravitational lens]]ing due to galactic clusters act as constraints. For those theories that aim to replace [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], the size of ripples in the spectrum of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is the strictest test. For those theories that incorporate or aim to replace [[dark energy]], the supernova brightness results and the age of the universe can be used as tests. Another test is the flatness of the universe. With general relativity, the combination of baryonic matter, dark matter and dark energy add up to make the universe exactly flat. As the accuracy of experimental tests improve, alternatives to general relativity that aim to replace dark matter or dark energy will have to explain why.\n\n== Results of testing theories ==\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian parameters for a range of theories ===\n(See Will<ref name=Will1981 /> and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 /> for more details. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> gives a table for translating parameters from the notation of Ni to that of Will)\n\nGeneral Relativity is now more than 100 years old, during which one alternative theory of gravity after another has failed to agree with ever more accurate observations. One illustrative example is [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. The following table lists Parametric post-Newtonian values for a large number of theories. If the value in a cell matches that in the column heading then the full formula is too complicated to include here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!Width=\"45\"|<math>\\gamma</math>\n!

A full list of Parametric post-Newtonian parameters is not available for Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922 />, Deser-Laurent<ref name=Deser1968 />, Bollini-Giambiagi-Tiomino<ref name=Bollini1970 />, but in these three cases <math>\\beta=\\xi</math>,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} which is in strong conflict with general relativity and experimental results. In particular, these theories predict incorrect amplitudes for the Earth's tides.  (A minor modification of [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]] avoids this problem.  However, the modification predicts the [[Nordtvedt effect]], which has been experimentally constrained.)\n\n=== Theories that fail other tests ===\nThe stratified theories of Ni<ref name=Ni1973 />, Lee Lightman and Ni<ref name=Lee1974 /> are non-starters because they all fail to explain the perihelion advance of Mercury. The bimetric theories of Lightman and Lee<ref name=Lightman1973 />, Rosen<ref name=Rosen1975 />, Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> all fail some of the tests associated with strong gravitational fields. The scalar-tensor theories include general relativity as a special case, but only agree with the Parametric post-Newtonian values of general relativity when they are equal to general relativity to within experimental error. As experimental tests get more accurate, the deviation of the scalar-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. The same is true of vector-tensor theories, the deviation of the vector-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. Further, vector-tensor theories are semi-conservative; they have a nonzero value for <math>\\alpha_2</math> which can have a measurable effect on the Earth's tides. Non-metric theories, such as Belinfante and Swihart,<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> usually fail to agree with experimental tests of Einstein's equivalence principle. And that leaves, as a likely valid alternative to general relativity, nothing except possibly Cartan.<ref name=Cartan1922 /> That was the situation until cosmological discoveries pushed the development of modern alternatives.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Carroll, Sean.

There have been many different attempts at constructing an ideal theory of [[gravity]].<ref name=\"Clifton\">{{cite journal | first =Timothy|last=Clifton|author2=Pedro G.

In this article, we discuss straightforward alternatives to general relativity, which do not involve quantum mechanics or force unification. Other theories which do attempt to construct a theory using the principles of quantum mechanics are known as theories of [[Quantum gravity|quantized gravity]]. Thirdly, there are theories which attempt to explain gravity and other forces at the same time; these are known as [[classical unified field theories]]. Finally, the most ambitious theories attempt to both put gravity in quantum mechanical terms and unify forces; these are called [[theory of everything|theories of everything]].\n\nNone of these alternatives to general relativity have gained wide acceptance. Despite many [[tests of general relativity]], general relativity has remained consistent with all observations so far. In contrast, many of the early alternatives have been definitively disproven. However, some of the alternative theories of gravity are supported by a minority of physicists, and the topic remains the subject of intense study in [[theoretical physics]].\n\n==History of gravitational theory through general relativity==\n{{Main|History of gravitational theory|History of general relativity}}\n\nEarly theories of gravity attempted to explain planetary orbits ([[Newtonian gravity|Newton]]) and more complicated orbits (e.g. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]). Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity. At the same time, experimental physicists started testing the foundations of gravity and relativity \u2013 [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]], the [[Tests of general relativity|gravitational deflection of light]], the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]. These considerations led to and past the development of [[general relativity]].\n\n===Newtonian gravity===\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation|Gauss's law for gravity}}\nIn Newton's theory<ref>{{cite book|last=Newton|first=I.|author-link=Isaac Newton|year=1686|title=[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]|language=la}}</ref> (rewritten using more modern mathematics) the density of mass <math>\\rho\\,</math> generates a scalar field, the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi\\,</math> in joules per kilogram, by\n:<math>{\\partial^2 \\varphi \\over \\partial x^j \\, \\partial x^j} = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nUsing the [[Nabla operator]] <math>\\nabla</math> for the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]] (partial derivatives), this can be conveniently written as:\n:<math>\\nabla^2 \\varphi = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nThis scalar field governs the motion of a [[free-fall]]ing particle by:\n:<math>{ d^2x^j\\over dt^2} = -{\\partial\\varphi\\over\\partial x^j\\,}.</math>\n\nAt distance ''r'' from an isolated mass ''M'', the scalar field is\n:<math>\\varphi = -\\frac{GM} r \\,.</math>\n\nThe [[Newtonian gravity|theory of Newton]], and Lagrange's improvement on the calculation (applying the variational principle), completely fails to take into account relativistic effects of course, and so can be rejected as a viable theory of gravity. Even so, Newton's theory is thought to be exactly correct in the limit of weak gravitational fields and low speeds and all other theories of gravity need to reproduce Newton's theory in the appropriate limits.\n\n===Mechanical explanations (1650\u20131900)===\nTo explain Newton's theory, some [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]] (including [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's theory]]) were created between 1650 and 1900, but they were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which is not observed. Other models are violating the [[energy conservation law]] and are incompatible with modern [[thermodynamics]].\n\n===Electrostatic models (1870\u20131900)===\nAt the end of the 19th century, many tried to combine Newton's force law with the established laws of electrodynamics, like those of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Those models were used to explain the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|perihelion advance of Mercury]]. In 1890, L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt, [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the Perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypothesis were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zenneck, J. |authorlink=Jonathan Zenneck |title=Gravitation |journal=Encyklop\u00e4die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen |date=1903 |volume=5 |pages=25\u201367 |language=German |doi=10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 |isbn=978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref> In 1900, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] tried to explain gravity on the basis of his [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the [[Maxwell equations]].

By then he knew of the gravitational redshift and the deflection of light. He had realized that [[Lorentz transformations]] are not generally applicable, but retained them.

(1917) \u00dcber die Spezielle und die Allgemeinen Relativat\u00e4tstheorie, Gemeinverst\u00e4ndlich, Vieweg, Braunschweig</ref> is what we now call \"general relativity\" (included here for comparison).

See [[relativity priority dispute]]. Hilbert was the first to correctly state the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] for general relativity, which is:\n\n:<math>S = {c^4 \\over 16 \\pi G} \\int R \\sqrt{-g} \\ d^4 x + S_m \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>G \\,</math> is Newton's gravitational constant, <math>R = R_{\\mu}^{~\\mu} \\,</math> is the [[Ricci curvature]] of space, <math>g = \\det ( g_{\\mu \\nu} ) \\,</math> and <math>S_m \\,</math> is the [[action (physics)|action]] due to mass.\n\nGeneral relativity is a tensor theory, the equations all contain tensors. Nordstr\u00f6m's theories, on the other hand, are scalar theories because the gravitational field is a scalar. Later in this article you will see scalar-tensor theories that contain a scalar field in addition to the tensors of general relativity, and other variants containing vector fields as well have been developed recently.\n\n== Motivations ==\nAfter general relativity, attempts were made either to improve on theories developed before general relativity, or to improve general relativity itself. Many different strategies were attempted, for example the addition of spin to general relativity, combining a general relativity-like metric with a spacetime that is static with respect to the expansion of the universe, getting extra freedom by adding another parameter. At least one theory was motivated by the desire to develop an alternative to general relativity that is free of singularities.\n\nExperimental tests improved along with the theories. Many of the different strategies that were developed soon after general relativity were abandoned, and there was a push to develop more general forms of the theories that survived, so that a theory would be ready when any test showed a disagreement with general relativity.\n\nBy the 1980s, the increasing accuracy of experimental tests had all confirmed general relativity; no competitors were left except for those that included general relativity as a special case. Further, shortly after that, theorists switched to string theory which was starting to look promising, but has since lost popularity. In the mid-1980s a few experiments were suggesting that gravity was being modified by the addition of a fifth force (or, in one case, of a fifth, sixth and seventh force) acting in the range of a few meters. Subsequent experiments eliminated these.\n\nMotivations for the more recent alternative theories are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"[[Cosmic inflation|inflation]]\", \"[[dark matter]]\" and \"[[dark energy]]\". Investigation of the [[Pioneer anomaly]] has caused renewed public interest in alternatives to general relativity.\n\n== Notation in this article ==\n{{Main|Mathematics of general relativity|Ricci calculus}}\n\n<math>c\\;</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>G\\;</math> is the [[gravitational constant]]. \"[[Natural units|Geometric variables]]\" are not used.\n\nLatin indices go from 1 to 3, Greek indices go from 0 to 3. The [[Einstein notation|Einstein summation convention]] is used.\n\n<math>\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski metric]]. <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is a tensor, usually the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]. These have [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212,+,+,+).\n\n[[Partial derivative|Partial differentiation]] is written <math>\\partial_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{,\\mu}\\;</math>. [[Covariant differentiation]] is written <math>\\nabla_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{;\\mu}\\;</math>.\n\n== Classification of theories ==\nTheories of gravity can be classified, loosely, into several categories. Most of the theories described here have:\n* an '[[Action (physics)|action]]' (see the [[principle of least action]], a [[variational principle]] based on the concept of action)\n* a [[Lagrangian density]]\n* a [[metric tensor|metric]]\n\nIf a theory has a Lagrangian density for gravity, say <math>L\\,</math>, then the gravitational part of the action <math>S\\,</math> is the integral of that:\n:<math>S = \\int L \\sqrt{-g} \\, \\mathrm{d}^4x </math>\n\nIn this equation it is usual, though not essential, to have <math>g = -1\\,</math> at spatial infinity when using Cartesian coordinates. For example, the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] uses\n:<math>L\\,\\propto\\, R </math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], a measure of the curvature of space.\n\nAlmost every theory described in this article has an [[Action (physics)|action]]. It is the only known way to guarantee that the necessary conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum are incorporated automatically; although it is easy to construct an action where those conservation laws are violated. The original 1983 version of [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]] did not have an action.\n\nA few theories have an action but not a Lagrangian density. A good example is Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922>Whitehead, A.N. (1922) ''The Principles of Relativity'', Cambridge Univ. Press</ref>, the action there is termed non-local.\n\nA theory of gravity is a \"metric theory\" if and only if it can be given a mathematical representation in which two conditions hold:<br />\n''Condition 1'': There exists a symmetric [[metric tensor]] <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math> of [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212, +, +, +), which governs proper-length and proper-time measurements in the usual manner of special and general relativity:\n\n:<math>{d\\tau}^2 = - g_{\\mu \\nu} \\, dx^\\mu \\, dx^\\nu \\,</math>\n\nwhere there is a summation over indices <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\nu</math>.<br />\n''Condition 2'': Stressed matter and fields being acted upon by gravity respond in accordance with the equation:\n\n:<math>0 = \\nabla_\\nu T^{\\mu \\nu} = {T^{\\mu \\nu}}_{,\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\sigma \\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\mu \\sigma} \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T^{\\mu \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] for all matter and non-gravitational fields, and where <math>\\nabla_{\\nu}</math> is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the metric and <math>\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\sigma \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]]. The stress\u2013energy tensor should also satisfy an [[energy condition]].\n\nMetric theories include (from simplest to most complex):\n* [[#Scalar field theories|Scalar field theories]] (includes Conformally flat theories & Stratified theories with conformally flat space slices)\n** Bergman\n** Coleman\n** Einstein (1912)\n** Einstein\u2013Fokker theory\n** [[David L.

Given that variable c and zero deflection of light are both in conflict with experiment, the prospect for a successful scalar theory of gravity looks very unlikely.

The status of Cartan's theory is uncertain. Will<ref name=Will1981 /> claims that all non-metric theories are eliminated by Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Will (2001) tempers that by explaining experimental criteria for testing non-metric theories against Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> claims that Cartan's theory is the only non-metric theory to survive all experimental tests up to that date and Turyshev<ref name=Turyshev2006>Turyshev, S. G. (2006) Testing gravity in the solar system, http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~hz4/workshop/workshopppt/turyshev.pdf</ref> lists Cartan's theory among the few that have survived all experimental tests up to that date. The following is a quick sketch of Cartan's theory as restated by Trautman.<ref name=Trautman1972>Trautman, A. (1972) On the Einstein\u2013Cartan equations I, Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Sciences 20, 185-190</ref>\n\nCartan<ref name=Cartan1922 /><ref name=Cartan1923 /> suggested a simple generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. He proposed a model of space time with a metric tensor and a linear \"connection\" compatible with the metric but not necessarily symmetric. The torsion tensor of the connection is related to the density of intrinsic angular momentum. Independently of Cartan, similar ideas were put forward by Sciama, by Kibble in the years 1958 to 1966, culminating in a 1976 review by Hehl et al.\n\nThe original description is in terms of differential forms, but for the present article that is replaced by the more familiar language of tensors (risking loss of accuracy). As in general relativity, the Lagrangian is made up of a massless and a mass part. The Lagrangian for the massless part is:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nL & ={1\\over 32\\pi G}\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu g^{\\nu\\xi}x^\\eta x^\\zeta \\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu & =d \\omega^\\mu_\\nu + \\omega^\\eta_\\xi \\\\[5pt]\n\\nabla x^\\mu & =-\\omega^\\mu_\\nu x^\\nu\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe <math>\\omega^\\mu_\\nu\\;</math> is the linear connection. <math>\\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta}\\;</math> is the completely antisymmetric pseudo-tensor ([[Levi-Civita symbol]]) with <math>\\varepsilon_{0123}=\\sqrt{-g}\\;</math>, and <math>g^{\\nu\\xi}\\,</math> is the metric tensor as usual. By assuming that the linear connection is metric, it is possible to remove the unwanted freedom inherent in the non-metric theory. The stress\u2013energy tensor is calculated from:\n\n:<math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 16\\pi G} (g^{\\mu\\nu}\\eta^\\xi_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\mu}\\eta^\\nu_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\nu} \\eta^\\mu_\\eta) \\Omega^\\eta_\\xi\\;</math>\n\nThe space curvature is not Riemannian, but on a Riemannian space-time the Lagrangian would reduce to the Lagrangian of general relativity.\n\nSome equations of the non-metric theory of Belinfante and Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> have already been discussed in the section on [[#Bimetric theories|bimetric theories]].\n\nA distinctively non-metric theory is given by [[gauge theory gravity]], which replaces the metric in its field equations with a pair of gauge fields in flat spacetime.  On the one hand, the theory is quite conservative because it is substantially equivalent to Einstein\u2013Cartan theory (or general relativity in the limit of vanishing spin), differing mostly in the nature of its global solutions.  On the other hand, it is radical because it replaces differential geometry with [[geometric algebra]].\n\n== Modern theories 1980s to present ==\nThis section includes alternatives to general relativity published after the observations of galaxy rotation that led to the hypothesis of \"dark matter\". There is no known reliable list of comparison of these theories.

These theories are presented with a cosmological constant or added scalar or vector potential.\n\n=== Motivations ===\nMotivations for the more recent alternatives to general relativity are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"inflation\", \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\". The basic idea is that gravity agrees with general relativity at the present epoch but may have been quite different in the early universe.\n\nThere was a slow dawning realisation in the physics world that there were several problems inherent in the then big bang scenario, two of these were the [[horizon problem]] and the observation that at early times when quarks were first forming there was not enough space on the universe to contain even one quark. Inflation theory was developed to overcome these. Another alternative was constructing an alternative to general relativity in which the speed of light was larger in the early universe. The discovery of unexpected rotation curves for galaxies took everyone by surprise. Could there be more mass in the universe than we are aware of, or is the theory of gravity itself wrong? The consensus now is that the missing mass is \"cold dark matter\", but that consensus was only reached after trying alternatives to general relativity and some physicists still believe that alternative models of gravity might hold the answer.\n\nIn the 1990s, supernova surveys discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe, usually attributed to [[dark energy]]. This led to the rapid reinstatement of Einstein's cosmological constant, and quintessence arrived as an alternative to the cosmological constant. At least one new alternative to general relativity attempted to explain the supernova surveys' results in a completely different way. The measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] ruled out many alternative theories of gravity as explanation for the accelerated expansion.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |journal=Physics Letters B|volume=765|pages=382\u2013385|first1=Lucas|last1=Lombriser |first2=Nelson|last2=Lima |arxiv=1602.07670 |year=2017|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2016.12.048|bibcode=2017PhLB..765..382L}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-02-quest-riddle-einstein-theory.html|title=Quest to settle riddle over Einstein's theory may soon be over|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|website=[[phys.org]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/science/2017/02/theoretical-battle-dark-energy-vs-modified-gravity/|title=Theoretical battle: Dark energy vs. modified gravity|date=February 25, 2017|access-date=October 27, 2017|website=[[Ars Technica]]|author=Xaq Rzetelny}}</ref> Another observation that sparked recent interest in alternatives to General Relativity is the [[Pioneer anomaly]]. It was quickly discovered that alternatives to general relativity could explain this anomaly. This is now believed to be accounted for by non-uniform thermal radiation.\n\n=== Cosmological constant and quintessence ===\n{{see also|Cosmological constant|Einstein\u2013Hilbert action|Quintessence (physics)}}\n\nThe cosmological constant <math>\\Lambda\\;</math> is a very old idea, going back to Einstein in 1917.<ref name=Einstein1917 /> The success of the Friedmann model of the universe in which <math>\\Lambda=0\\;</math> led to the general acceptance that it is zero, but the use of a non-zero value came back with a vengeance when data from supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating\n\nFirst, let's see how it influences the equations of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity. In Newtonian gravity, the addition of the cosmological constant changes the Newton\u2013Poisson equation from:\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi=4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi + \\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda c^2 = 4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nIn general relativity, it changes the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action from\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int R\\sqrt{-g} \\, d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int (R-2\\Lambda)\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nwhich changes the field equation\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G} \\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R \\right)\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G}\\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R + g^{\\mu\\nu} \\Lambda \\right)\\;</math>\n\nIn alternative theories of gravity, a cosmological constant can be added to the action in exactly the same way.\n\nThe cosmological constant is not the only way to get an accelerated expansion of the universe in alternatives to general relativity. We've already seen how the scalar potential <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> can be added to scalar tensor theories. This can also be done in every alternative the general relativity that contains a scalar field <math>\\varphi\\;</math> by adding the term <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> inside the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action, the <math>L_\\varphi\\;</math> part of\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4x \\, \\sqrt{-g} \\, L_\\varphi+S_m\\;</math>\n\nBecause <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> is an arbitrary function of the scalar field, it can be set to give an acceleration that is large in the early universe and small at the present epoch. This is known as quintessence.\n\nA similar method can be used in alternatives to general relativity that use vector fields, including Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> and vector-tensor theories. A term proportional to\n\n: <math>K^\\mu K^\\nu g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math>\n\nis added to the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action.\n\n=== Farnes' theories === \nIn December 2018, the astrophysicist [[Jamie Farnes]] from the [[University of Oxford]] proposed a [[dark fluid]] theory, related to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses that were presented earlier by [[Albert Einstein]]. The theory may help to better understand the considerable amounts of unknown [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] in the [[universe]].<ref name=\"ARX-2018\">{{cite journal |last=Farnes |first=J.S. |title=A Unifying Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Negative Masses and Matter Creation within a Modified \u039bCDM Framework |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=620 |pages=A92 |arxiv=1712.07962 |year=2018 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832898 |bibcode=2018A&A...620A..92F }}</ref>\n\nThe theory relies on the concept of [[negative mass]] and reintroduces [[Fred Hoyle]]'s creation tensor in order to allow [[matter creation]] for only negative mass particles. In this way, the negative mass particles surround galaxies and apply a pressure onto them, thereby resembling dark matter. As these hypothesised particles mutually repel one another, they push apart the Universe, thereby resembling dark energy. The creation of matter allows the density of the exotic negative mass particles to remain constant as a function of time, and so appears like a [[cosmological constant]]. Einstein's field equations are modified to:\n: <math>R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} \\left( T_{\\mu \\nu}^{+} + T_{\\mu \\nu}^{-} + C_{\\mu \\nu} \\right)</math>\n\nAccording to Occam's razor, Farnes' theory is a simpler alternative to the conventional LambdaCDM model, as both dark energy and dark matter (two hypotheses) are solved using a single negative mass fluid (one hypothesis). The theory will be directly testable using the world's largest radio telescope, the [[Square Kilometre Array]] which should come online in 2022.<ref name=\"EA-20181205\">{{cite web |author=University of Oxford |title=Bringing balance to the universe: New theory could explain missing 95 percent of the cosmos |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/uoo-bbt120318.php |date=5 December 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=6 December 2018 |author-link=University of Oxford }}</ref>\n\n=== Relativistic MOND ===\n{{main|Modified Newtonian dynamics|Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|Extended theories of gravity}}\n\nThe original theory of MOND by Milgrom was developed in 1983 as an alternative to \"dark matter\". Departures from Newton's law of gravitation are governed by an acceleration scale, not a distance scale. MOND successfully explains the Tully-Fisher observation that the luminosity of a galaxy should scale as the fourth power of the rotation speed. It also explains why the rotation discrepancy in dwarf galaxies is particularly large.\n\nThere were several problems with MOND in the beginning.\n# It did not include relativistic effects\n# It violated the conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum\n# It was inconsistent in that it gives different galactic orbits for gas and for stars\n# It did not state how to calculate gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters.\n\nBy 1984, problems 2 and 3 had been solved by introducing a Lagrangian ([[AQUAL]]). A relativistic version of this based on scalar-tensor theory was rejected because it allowed waves in the scalar field to propagate faster than light. The Lagrangian of the non-relativistic form is:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}f\\left\\lbrack \\frac{|\\nabla\\varphi|^2}{a_0^2}\\right\\rbrack-\\rho\\varphi</math>\n\nThe relativistic version of this has:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}\\tilde f \\left( \\ell_0^2 g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi \\right )</math>\n\nwith a nonstandard mass action. Here <math>f</math> and <math>\\tilde f</math> are arbitrary functions selected to give Newtonian and MOND behaviour in the correct limits, and <math>l_0 = c^2/a_0\\;</math> is the MOND length scale. By 1988, a second scalar field (PCC) fixed problems with the earlier scalar-tensor version but is in conflict with the perihelion precession of Mercury and gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters. By 1997, MOND had been successfully incorporated in a stratified relativistic theory [Sanders], but as this is a preferred frame theory it has problems of its own. Bekenstein<ref name=Bekenstein2004 /> introduced a [[Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|tensor-vector-scalar]] model (TeVeS). This has two scalar fields <math>\\varphi</math>  and <math>\\sigma\\;</math> and vector field <math>U_\\alpha</math>.

Their constraint is eight orders of magnitude sharper than previous estimates.\n\nMoffat's<ref name=Moffat2005 /> metric-skew-tensor-gravity (MSTG) theory is able to predict rotation curves for galaxies without either dark matter or MOND, and claims that it can also explain gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters without dark matter. It has variable <math>G\\;</math>, increasing to a final constant value about a million years after the big bang.\n \nThe theory seems to contain an asymmetric tensor <math>A_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> field and a source current <math>J_\\mu\\;</math> vector. The action is split into:\n\n: <math>S=S_G+S_F+S_{FM}+S_M\\;</math>\n\nBoth the gravity and mass terms match those of general relativity with cosmological constant.

The skew field coupling is a Pauli coupling and is gauge invariant for any source current. The source current looks like a matter fermion field associated with baryon and lepton number.\n\n====Scalar-tensor-vector gravity====\n{{main|Scalar\u2013tensor\u2013vector gravity}}\n\nMoffat's [[Scalar\u2013tensor\u2013vector gravity]]<ref name=Moffat2006 /> contains a tensor, vector and three scalar fields. But the equations are quite straightforward. The action is split into: <math> S=S_G+S_K+S_S+S_M</math> with terms for gravity, vector field <math>K_\\mu,</math> scalar fields <math>G, \\omega, \\mu</math> and mass. <math>S_G</math> is the standard gravity term with the exception that <math>G</math> is moved inside the integral.\n\n: <math>S_K=-\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g}\\omega \\left( \\frac14 B_{\\mu\\nu} B^{\\mu\\nu} + V(K) \\right), \\qquad \\text{where } \\quad B_{\\mu\\nu}=\\partial_\\mu K_\\nu-\\partial_\\nu K_\\mu.</math>\n\n: <math>S_S = -\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g} \\frac{1}{G^3} \\left( \\frac12g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu G\\,\\nabla_\\nu G -V(G) \\right) + \\frac{1}{G} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu\\omega\\,\\nabla_\\nu\\omega -V(\\omega) \\right) +{1\\over\\mu^2G} \\left( \\frac12g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu\\mu\\,\\nabla_\\nu\\mu - V(\\mu) \\right).</math>\n\nThe potential function for the vector field is chosen to be:\n\n: <math>V(K) = -\\frac12\\mu^2\\varphi^\\mu\\varphi_\\mu - \\frac14g \\left (\\varphi^\\mu \\varphi_\\mu \\right )^2</math>\n\nwhere <math>g</math> is a coupling constant. The functions assumed for the scalar potentials are not stated.\n\n=== Infinite derivative gravity ===\n{{main|Infinite derivative gravity}}\nIn order to remove ghosts in the modified propagator, as well as to obtain asymptotic freedom, Biswas, [[Anupam Mazumdar|Mazumdar]] and [[Warren Siegel|Siegel]] (2005) considered a string-inspired infinite set of higher derivative terms\n:<math>S = \\int \\mathrm{d}^4x  \\sqrt{-g} \\left(\\frac{R}{2} + R F (\\Box) R \\right)</math>\nwhere <math> F (\\Box)</math> is the exponential of an entire function of the [[d'Alembert operator|D'Alembertian operator]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Bouncing Universes in String-inspired Gravity|journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|volume=2006|issue=3|pages=009|arxiv=hep-th/0508194|bibcode = 2006JCAP...03..009B |doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2006/03/009 |year=2006|last1=Biswas|first1=Tirthabir|last2=Mazumdar|first2=Anupam|last3=Siegel|first3=Warren}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|arxiv=1308.2319 |title=Generalized ghost-free quadratic curvature gravity|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|volume=31|issue=1|pages=015022|last1=Biswas|first1=Tirthabir|last2=Conroy|first2=Aindri\u00fa|last3= Koshelev|first3=Alexey S.|last4=Mazumdar|first4=Anupam|year=2013|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/31/1/015022|bibcode = 2014CQGra..31a5022B }}</ref> This avoids a black hole singularity near the origin, while recovering the 1/r fall of the general relativity potential at large distances.<ref>{{Cite journal|arxiv=1110.5249|title=Towards singularity and ghost free theories of gravity|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=108|issue=3|last1=Biswas|first1=Tirthabir|last2=Gerwick|first2=Erik|last3=Koivisto|first3=Tomi|last4=Mazumdar|first4=Anupam|year=2011|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.031101|bibcode=2012PhRvL.108c1101B|pmid=22400725|page=031101}}</ref> [[Carlos Lousto|Lousto]] and Mazzitelli (1997) found an exact solution to this theories representing a gravitational shock-wave.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.56.3471|title=Exact self-consistent gravitational shock wave in semiclassical gravity|journal=Physical Review D|volume=56|issue=6|pages=3471\u20133477|year=1997|last1=Lousto|first1=Carlos O|last2=Mazzitelli|first2=Francisco D|bibcode=1997PhRvD..56.3471L|arxiv=gr-qc/9611009}}</ref>\n\n== Testing of alternatives to general relativity ==\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nAny putative alternative to general relativity would need to meet a variety of tests for it to become accepted.  For in-depth coverage of these tests, see Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> Ch.39, Will <ref name=Will1981 /> Table 2.1, and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 />.  Most such tests can be categorized as in the following subsections.\n\n=== Self-consistency ===\nSelf-consistency among non-metric theories includes eliminating theories allowing [[tachyon]]s, ghost poles and higher order poles, and those that have problems with behaviour at infinity. Among metric theories, self-consistency is best illustrated by describing several theories that fail this test. The classic example is the spin-two field theory of Fierz and Pauli<ref name=Fierz1939 />); the field equations imply that gravitating bodies move in straight lines, whereas the equations of motion insist that gravity deflects bodies away from straight line motion. Yilmaz (1971)<ref name=Yilmaz1973 /> contains a tensor gravitational field used to construct a metric; it is mathematically inconsistent because the functional dependence of the metric on the tensor field is not well defined.\n\n=== Completeness ===\nTo be complete, a theory of gravity must be capable of analysing the outcome of every experiment of interest. It must therefore mesh with electromagnetism and all other physics. For instance, any theory that cannot predict from first principles the movement of planets or the behaviour of atomic clocks is incomplete.\n\nMany early theories are incomplete in that it is unclear whether the density <math>\\rho</math> used by the theory should be calculated from the stress\u2013energy tensor <math>T</math> as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu</math> or as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^{\\mu \\nu}</math>, where <math>u</math> is the [[four-velocity]], and <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. The theories of Thirry (1948) and Jordan<ref name=Jordan1955 /> are incomplete unless Jordan's parameter <math>\\eta\\;</math> is set to -1, in which case they match the theory of Brans\u2013Dicke<ref name=Brans1961 /> and so are worthy of further consideration. Milne<ref name=Milne1948 /> is incomplete because it makes no gravitational red-shift prediction. The theories of Whitrow and Morduch<ref name=Whitrow1960 /><ref name=Whitrow1965 />, Kustaanheimo<ref name=Kustaanheimo1966 /> and Kustaanheimo and Nuotio<ref name=Kustaanheimo1967 /> are either incomplete or inconsistent. The incorporation of Maxwell's equations is incomplete unless it is assumed that they are imposed on the flat background space-time, and when that is done they are inconsistent, because they predict zero gravitational redshift when the wave version of light (Maxwell theory) is used, and nonzero redshift when the particle version (photon) is used. Another more obvious example is Newtonian gravity with Maxwell's equations; light as photons is deflected by gravitational fields (by half that of general relativity) but light as waves is not.\n\n=== Classical tests ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\nThere are three \"classical\" tests (dating back to the 1910s or earlier) of the ability of gravity theories to handle relativistic effects; they are [[gravitational redshift]], [[gravitational lensing]] (generally tested around the Sun), and anomalous perihelion advance of the planets. Each theory should reproduce the observed results in these areas, which have to date always aligned with the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] found a fourth test, called the [[Shapiro delay]]. It is usually regarded as a \"classical\" test as well.\n\n=== Agreement with Newtonian mechanics and special relativity ===\nAs an example of disagreement with Newtonian experiments, Birkhoff<ref name=Birkhoff1943>{{cite journal | last1 = Birkhoff | first1 = G. D. | year = 1943 | title = Matter, electricity and gravitation in flat space-time | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences U.S.A. | volume = 29 | issue = 8| pages = 231\u2013239 | doi=10.1073/pnas.29.8.231| pmid = 16578082 |bibcode = 1943PNAS...29..231B | pmc = 1078600}}</ref> theory predicts relativistic effects fairly reliably but demands that sound waves travel at the speed of light. This was the consequence of an assumption made to simplify handling the collision of masses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== The Einstein equivalence principle ===\n{{Main|Equivalence principle}}\n\nEinstein's Equivalence Principle has three components. The first is the uniqueness of free fall, also known as the Weak Equivalence Principle. This is satisfied if inertial mass is equal to gravitational mass. ''\u03b7'' is a parameter used to test the maximum allowable violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. The first tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle were done by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s before 1900 and limited ''\u03b7'' to less than 5{{e|-9}}. Modern tests have reduced that to less than 5{{e|-13}}. The second is Lorentz invariance. In the absence of gravitational effects the speed of light is constant. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b4''. The first tests of Lorentz invariance were done by Michelson and Morley before 1890 and limited ''\u03b4'' to less than 5{{e|-3}}. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-21}}. The third is local position invariance, which includes spatial and temporal invariance. The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment is independent of where and when it is performed. Spatial local position invariance is tested using gravitational redshift measurements. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b1''. Upper limits on this found by Pound and Rebka in 1960 limited ''\u03b1'' to less than 0.1. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-4}}.\n\n[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture states that any complete, self-consistent theory of gravity that embodies the Weak Equivalence Principle necessarily embodies Einstein's Equivalence Principle. This is likely to be true if the theory has full energy conservation. Metric theories satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle. Extremely few non-metric theories satisfy this. For example, the non-metric theory of Belinfante & Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> is eliminated by the ''TH\u03b5\u03bc'' formalism for testing Einstein's Equivalence Principle.  Gauge theory gravity is a notable exception, where the strong equivalence principle is essentially the [[minimal coupling]] of the [[gauge covariant derivative]].\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian formalism ===\n{{Main|Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism}}\n\nSee also [[Tests of general relativity]], Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> and Will<ref name=Will1981 /> for more information.\n\nWork on developing a standardized rather than ad-hoc set of tests for evaluating alternative gravitation models began with Eddington in 1922 and resulted in a standard set of Parametric post-Newtonian numbers in Nordtvedt and Will<ref name=Nordtvedt1972>{{cite journal | last1 = Nordtvedt Jr | first1 = K. | last2 = Will | first2 = C. M. | year = 1972 | title = Conservation laws and preferred frames in relativistic gravity II | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 177 | issue = | page = 775 | bibcode = 1972ApJ...177..775N | doi = 10.1086/151755 }}</ref> and Will and Nordtvedt<ref name=Will1972 />. Each parameter measures a different aspect of how much a theory departs from Newtonian gravity. Because we are talking about deviation from Newtonian theory here, these only measure weak-field effects. The effects of strong gravitational fields are examined later.\n\nThese ten are: <math>\\gamma, \\beta,\\eta,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3,\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4.</math>\n\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is a measure of space curvature, being zero for Newtonian gravity and one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\beta</math> is a measure of nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\eta</math> is a check for preferred location effects.\n*<math>\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of \"preferred-frame effects\". Any theory of gravity in which at least one of the three is nonzero is called a preferred-frame theory.\n*<math>\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of breakdowns in global conservation laws. A theory of gravity possesses 4 conservation laws for energy-momentum and 6 for angular momentum only if all five are zero.\n\n=== Strong gravity and gravitational waves ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nParametric post-Newtonian is only a measure of weak field effects. Strong gravity effects can be seen in compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Experimental tests such as the stability of white dwarfs, spin-down rate of pulsars, orbits of binary pulsars and the existence of a black hole horizon can be used as tests of alternative to general relativity. General relativity predicts that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Many alternatives to general relativity say that gravitational waves travel faster than light, possibly breaking of causality. After the multi-messaging detection of the GW170817 coalescence of neutron stars, where light and gravitational waves were measured to travel at the same speed with an error of 1/10<sup>15</sup>, many of those modified theory of gravity were excluded.\n\n=== Cosmological tests ===\nMany of these have been developed recently. For those theories that aim to replace [[dark matter]], the [[galaxy rotation curve]], the [[Tully-Fisher relation]], the faster rotation rate of dwarf galaxies, and the [[gravitational lens]]ing due to galactic clusters act as constraints. For those theories that aim to replace [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], the size of ripples in the spectrum of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is the strictest test. For those theories that incorporate or aim to replace [[dark energy]], the supernova brightness results and the age of the universe can be used as tests. Another test is the flatness of the universe. With general relativity, the combination of baryonic matter, dark matter and dark energy add up to make the universe exactly flat. As the accuracy of experimental tests improve, alternatives to general relativity that aim to replace dark matter or dark energy will have to explain why.\n\n== Results of testing theories ==\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian parameters for a range of theories ===\n(See Will<ref name=Will1981 /> and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 /> for more details. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> gives a table for translating parameters from the notation of Ni to that of Will)\n\nGeneral Relativity is now more than 100 years old, during which one alternative theory of gravity after another has failed to agree with ever more accurate observations. One illustrative example is [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. The following table lists Parametric post-Newtonian values for a large number of theories. If the value in a cell matches that in the column heading then the full formula is too complicated to include here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!Width=\"45\"|<math>\\gamma</math>\n!

A full list of Parametric post-Newtonian parameters is not available for Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922 />, Deser-Laurent<ref name=Deser1968 />, Bollini-Giambiagi-Tiomino<ref name=Bollini1970 />, but in these three cases <math>\\beta=\\xi</math>,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} which is in strong conflict with general relativity and experimental results. In particular, these theories predict incorrect amplitudes for the Earth's tides.  (A minor modification of [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]] avoids this problem.  However, the modification predicts the [[Nordtvedt effect]], which has been experimentally constrained.)\n\n=== Theories that fail other tests ===\nThe stratified theories of Ni<ref name=Ni1973 />, Lee Lightman and Ni<ref name=Lee1974 /> are non-starters because they all fail to explain the perihelion advance of Mercury. The bimetric theories of Lightman and Lee<ref name=Lightman1973 />, Rosen<ref name=Rosen1975 />, Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> all fail some of the tests associated with strong gravitational fields. The scalar-tensor theories include general relativity as a special case, but only agree with the Parametric post-Newtonian values of general relativity when they are equal to general relativity to within experimental error. As experimental tests get more accurate, the deviation of the scalar-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. The same is true of vector-tensor theories, the deviation of the vector-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. Further, vector-tensor theories are semi-conservative; they have a nonzero value for <math>\\alpha_2</math> which can have a measurable effect on the Earth's tides. Non-metric theories, such as Belinfante and Swihart,<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> usually fail to agree with experimental tests of Einstein's equivalence principle. And that leaves, as a likely valid alternative to general relativity, nothing except possibly Cartan.<ref name=Cartan1922 /> That was the situation until cosmological discoveries pushed the development of modern alternatives.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Carroll, Sean.

This was opposed by a majority of members, but the NUM nevertheless withdrew, leaving the federation to relocate its headquarters to [[Brussels]] and struggle with a shortage of funds.<ref name=\"scargill\">Ronald Payne and Gary Busch, \"[http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/30th-november-1985/13/scargill-goes-international Scargill goes international]\", ''[[The Spectator]]'', 30 November 1985</ref>\n\nThe MIF began recruiting unions in other parts of the world, and by 1994 consisted of 58 unions with 4.2 million members.  In 1995, it merged with the [[International Federation of Chemical and General Workers' Unions]] to form the [[International Federation of Chemical, Energy, Mine and General Workers' Unions]].<ref name=\"docherty\" />\n\n==Affiliates==\nIn 1960, the following unions were affiliated to the federation:<ref name=\"goldberg\">{{cite book |last1=Goldberg |first1=Arthur |title=Directory of International Trade Union Organizations |date=1960 |publisher=United States Department of Labour |location=Washington DC |pages=10.1&ndash;10.16}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It is held annually in August and features games from the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series such as the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video games]], ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'', ''[[Pokk\u00e9n Tournament]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''. Players earn invitations to the World Championships based on their performance in qualifiers and other tournaments held throughout the season and compete for scholarship money, prizes and the title of World Champion. With the exception of [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], invitations to the World Championships are administered by the [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]] program.\n\n==History==\nThe Pok\u00e9mon World Championships first began with the [[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]] (TCG) in 2004. In 2009, Play! Pok\u00e9mon began to organize competitive tournaments for the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series alongside the TCG, which is collectively known as the Video Game Championships (VGC). Like the TCG Championships, players compete with other players in their own age divisions (i.e. Junior, Senior and Masters) in different Premier Tournaments, and the season culminates with the best players earning an invitation to play the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships in August. The tournaments in VGC are played with a different game each year. \n\nIn 2016, Play! Pok\u00e9mon announced that ''[[Pokk\u00e9n Tournament]]'' will have its own championship series and will be played at the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships.<ref>Official Pokk\u00e9n Tournament website, http://www.pokkentournament.com/en-us/championship-series/</ref>\n\nIn 2019, it was announced that the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships would take place in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]],<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> the first time in which the World Championships would be held in a location outside of [[North America]]. This is likely due to the setting of [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield'']], which takes place in a region inspired by the United Kingdom known as Galar, and it is the set of games that would be played by the video game division of the World Championships.  \n\nOn March 31, 2020, [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]] cancelled the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships and suspended its 2020 season due to health concerns over the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/2020-pokemon-championship-series-canceled/|title=2020 Pok\u00e9mon Championship Series Canceled {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyesports.gg/2020-pokemon-championship-series-suspended-due-to-coronavirus/|title=2020 Pok\u00e9mon Championship Series suspended due to coronavirus|date=2020-03-31|website=Daily Esports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> This came after earlier announcements in March which saw the cancellation of the 2020 European International Championships<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/update-for-the-2020-pokemon-europe-international-championships/|title=Update for the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon Europe International Championships {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/28852369/pokemon-cancels-europe-international-championship-coronavirus-cases-swell|title=Pok\u00e9mon championship canceled as coronavirus cases swell|date=2020-03-06|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> and part of its season between March and May 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyesports.gg/play-pokemon-cancels-more-sanctioned-events-due-to-coronavirus/|title=Play Pok\u00e9mon cancels more sanctioned events due to coronavirus|date=2020-03-17|website=Daily Esports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/esports-arena-leagues-shift-online-events-coronavirus-pandemic-1285112|title=Esports Arena: Leagues Shift to Online Events Amid Coronavirus Pandemic|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It is held annually in August and features games from the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series such as the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video games]], ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'', ''[[Pokk\u00e9n Tournament]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''. Players earn invitations to the World Championships based on their performance in qualifiers and other tournaments held throughout the season and compete for scholarship money, prizes and the title of World Champion. With the exception of [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], invitations to the World Championships are administered by the [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]] program.\n\n==History==\nThe Pok\u00e9mon World Championships first began with the [[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]] (TCG) in 2004. In 2009, Play! Pok\u00e9mon began to organize competitive tournaments for the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series alongside the TCG, which is collectively known as the Video Game Championships (VGC). Like the TCG Championships, players compete with other players in their own age divisions (i.e. Junior, Senior and Masters) in different Premier Tournaments, and the season culminates with the best players earning an invitation to play the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships in August. The tournaments in VGC are played with a different game each year. \n\nIn 2016, Play! Pok\u00e9mon announced that ''[[Pokk\u00e9n Tournament]]'' will have its own championship series and will be played at the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships.<ref>Official Pokk\u00e9n Tournament website, http://www.pokkentournament.com/en-us/championship-series/</ref>\n\nIn 2019, it was announced that the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships would take place in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]],<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> the first time in which the World Championships would be held in a location outside of [[North America]]. This is likely due to the setting of [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield'']], which takes place in a region inspired by the United Kingdom known as Galar, and it is the set of games that would be played by the video game division of the World Championships.  \n\nOn March 31, 2020, [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]] cancelled the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships and suspended its 2020 season due to health concerns over the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/2020-pokemon-championship-series-canceled/|title=2020 Pok\u00e9mon Championship Series Canceled {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyesports.gg/2020-pokemon-championship-series-suspended-due-to-coronavirus/|title=2020 Pok\u00e9mon Championship Series suspended due to coronavirus|date=2020-03-31|website=Daily Esports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> This came after earlier announcements in March which saw the cancellation of the 2020 European International Championships<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/update-for-the-2020-pokemon-europe-international-championships/|title=Update for the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon Europe International Championships {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/28852369/pokemon-cancels-europe-international-championship-coronavirus-cases-swell|title=Pok\u00e9mon championship canceled as coronavirus cases swell|date=2020-03-06|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> and part of its season between March and May 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyesports.gg/play-pokemon-cancels-more-sanctioned-events-due-to-coronavirus/|title=Play Pok\u00e9mon cancels more sanctioned events due to coronavirus|date=2020-03-17|website=Daily Esports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/esports-arena-leagues-shift-online-events-coronavirus-pandemic-1285112|title=Esports Arena: Leagues Shift to Online Events Amid Coronavirus Pandemic|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It lies just south-west of [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]], and on the [[B1397 road|B1397]] &ndash; the former A16 London Road &ndash; between Boston and [[Kirton, Lincolnshire|Kirton]]. The [[A16 road (England)|A16]] along the former East Lincolnshire railway line bisects the village. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 3,747.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11131021&c=Wyberton&d=16&e=62&g=6445876&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1465036982984&enc=1|title=Civil Parish population 2011|accessdate=4 June 2016|publisher=Office for National Statistics|work=Neighbourhood Statistics}}</ref>\n\nWyberton is one of eighteen [[Civil parish|parishes]] which, together with [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]], form the [[Boston (borough)|Borough of Boston]]. The local government has been arranged in this way since the reorganization of 1 April 1974, which resulted from the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Wyberton forms an electoral ward in itself.
