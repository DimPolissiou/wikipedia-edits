However, as this was an [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peerage]], it did not entitle him to a seat in the [[House of Lords]] (although it did entitle him to a seat in the [[Irish House of Lords]]). In 1754 Lord Verney was one of the largest landowners in Buckinghamshire; controlled two seats at Wendover; owned burgages at Great Bedwyn. He went on to acquire a considerable interest at Carmarthen. Through folly and extravagance he wasted his fortune and finally had to sell or surrender his parliamentary interest.\n\nUnder George II and in the early years of George III he was a regular Government supporter, and in 1754 and 1761 placed one seat at Wendover at Newcastle's disposal. But in 1761 Lord Fitzmaurice wrote that Verney was \u2018much offended with the Duke of Newcastle\u2019, <ref name=\"Fitzmaurice to Bute, 2 Mar. 1761, Bute mss.\"/> and Verney himself in 1763 stated that he had never received \u2018the smallest obligation\u2019 from the Pelhams.2 In 1761 or 1762 he became acquainted with William Burke, about whom Fox wrote in 1763:3 \u2018He has as great a sway with Lord Verney as I ever knew one man have with another.\u2019 In November 1762, when Fox was engaged in securing a majority for the peace preliminaries, Verney was \u2018the very man he knew not how to come round\u2019; and was won over by William Burke.4 On 9 Dec. Verney seconded the Address on the peace preliminaries, and, according to Fox, was \u2018never absent\u2019 that session.\n\nOn 9 Apr. 1763 he applied to Fox for a British peerage:5 \u2018My fortune is above \u00a310,000 per annum\u2019, he wrote, \u2018... my own personal attachment to Government has been sincere, constant, and uniform ... and ... I have expended very large sums in several elections without obtaining, or indeed asking to this time, any favour whatever.\u2019 And to Grenville, 29 Apr. 1763:6 \u2018My whole life has shown how much I have been inclined to forward the business of the Crown.\u2019\n\nHe was hurt and disappointed that nothing had been done for him, and Grenville could make no promises. Nor did he help towards vacating the seat at Wendover which Verney wanted for William Burke. On 12 Nov. 1763 Holland wrote to Sandwich:7 \u2018Lord Temple has courted Lord Verney extremely, and he thinks Mr. Grenville has neglected him.\u2019 Certainly Grenville and Verney seem to have had no liking for each other; yet Verney, although he spoke for the repeal of the cider duty, 31 Jan. 1764, did not vote against Grenville's Administration in any of the divisions over general warrants nor was he ever claimed by the Opposition as one of their adherents.\n\nWilliam Burke was given a place by the Rockingham Administration, and Verney was made a P.C.\u2014an unusual distinction for one who held no office. He followed the Burkes into opposition and voted consistently with the Rockinghams, but was never in the party's inner circle: he did not, for example, attend the Opposition dinner of 9 May 1769, and in 1774 so prominent a figure as Richmond did not know him.8 After 1764 only one speech by him is recorded\u20145 June 1780, on presenting the Buckinghamshire petition.\n\n==Claydon House==\nHe rebuilt [[Claydon House]] in Buckinghamshire between 1757 and 1771. The house today represents only the west wing, which was originally connected to an identical east wing by a colonnaded rotunda surmounted by a cupola. Cost overruns on the building meant that Lord Verney had to spend the final years of his life on the continent to escape his creditors.\n\n==Family==\nLord Verney married Mary, daughter of Henry Herring, in 1740. This marriage introduced a settlement of \u00a330,000 to the family as Herring was one of the Directors of the Bank of England. Lord Verney also received \u00a340,000 from the settlement received by his late brother's widow, Mary Nicholson. His elder brother, The Hon.

However, as this was an [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peerage]], it did not entitle him to a seat in the [[House of Lords]] (although it did entitle him to a seat in the [[Irish House of Lords]]). In 1754 Lord Verney was one of the largest landowners in Buckinghamshire; controlled two seats at Wendover; owned burgages at Great Bedwyn. He went on to acquire a considerable interest at Carmarthen. Through folly and extravagance he wasted his fortune and finally had to sell or surrender his parliamentary interest.\n\nUnder George II and in the early years of George III he was a regular Government supporter, and in 1754 and 1761 placed one seat at Wendover at Newcastle\u2019s disposal. But in 1761 Lord Fitzmaurice wrote that Verney was \u2018much offended with the Duke of Newcastle\u2019, <ref name=\"Fitzmaurice to Bute, 2 Mar. 1761, Bute mss.\"/> and Verney himself in 1763 stated that he had never received \u2018the smallest obligation\u2019 from the Pelhams.2 In 1761 or 1762 he became acquainted with William Burke, about whom Fox wrote in 1763:3 \u2018He has as great a sway with Lord Verney as I ever knew one man have with another.\u2019 In November 1762, when Fox was engaged in securing a majority for the peace preliminaries, Verney was \u2018the very man he knew not how to come round\u2019; and was won over by William Burke.4 On 9 Dec. Verney seconded the Address on the peace preliminaries, and, according to Fox, was \u2018never absent\u2019 that session.\n\nOn 9 Apr. 1763 he applied to Fox for a British peerage:5 \u2018My fortune is above \u00a310,000 per annum\u2019, he wrote, \u2018... my own personal attachment to Government has been sincere, constant, and uniform ... and ... I have expended very large sums in several elections without obtaining, or indeed asking to this time, any favour whatever.\u2019 And to Grenville, 29 Apr. 1763:6 \u2018My whole life has shown how much I have been inclined to forward the business of the Crown.\u2019\n\nHe was hurt and disappointed that nothing had been done for him, and Grenville could make no promises. Nor did he help towards vacating the seat at Wendover which Verney wanted for William Burke. On 12 Nov. 1763 Holland wrote to Sandwich:7 \u2018Lord Temple has courted Lord Verney extremely, and he thinks Mr. Grenville has neglected him.\u2019 Certainly Grenville and Verney seem to have had no liking for each other; yet Verney, although he spoke for the repeal of the cider duty, 31 Jan. 1764, did not vote against Grenville\u2019s Administration in any of the divisions over general warrants nor was he ever claimed by the Opposition as one of their adherents.\n\nWilliam Burke was given a place by the Rockingham Administration, and Verney was made a P.C.\u2014an unusual distinction for one who held no office. He followed the Burkes into opposition and voted consistently with the Rockinghams, but was never in the party\u2019s inner circle: he did not, for example, attend the Opposition dinner of 9 May 1769, and in 1774 so prominent a figure as Richmond did not know him.8 After 1764 only one speech by him is recorded\u20145 June 1780, on presenting the Buckinghamshire petition.\n\n==Claydon House==\nHe rebuilt [[Claydon House]] in Buckinghamshire between 1757 and 1771. The house today represents only the west wing, which was originally connected to an identical east wing by a colonnaded rotunda surmounted by a cupola. Cost overruns on the building meant that Lord Verney had to spend the final years of his life on the continent to escape his creditors.\n\n==Family==\nLord Verney married Mary, daughter of Henry Herring, in 1740. This marriage introduced a settlement of \u00a330,000 to the family as Herring was one of the Directors of the Bank of England. Lord Verney also received \u00a340,000 from the settlement received by his late brother's widow, Mary Nicholson. His elder brother, The Hon. John Verney had died in 1737 only a year after his marriage. This marriage produced only one daughter, Mary Verney, and so the estate instead passed to Ralph, who became the 2nd Earl Verney. He and the Countess had no children before her death in January 1791, aged 74. Lord Verney only survived her by two months and died in March of the same year, aged 77.

Pick is used primarily for business [[data processing]]. It is named after one of its developers, Dick Pick.\n\nThe term \"Pick system\" has also come to be used as the general name of all [[operating environment]]s which employ this multivalued database and have some implementation of Pick/BASIC and [[ENGLISH (programming language)|ENGLISH]]/[[Access query language|Access]] queries. Although Pick started on a variety of [[minicomputer]]s, the system and its various implementations eventually spread to a large assortment of [[microcomputer]]s, personal computers<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=July 27, 1987|title=PICK Operating System - brings Mainframe Power to your PC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6DsEAAAAMBAJ|magazine=InfoWorld|page=80|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[mainframe computer]]s.<ref>it was actually developed on an IBM mainframe</ref><ref name=CP/>\n\n==Overview==\nThe Pick operating system consists of a database, dictionary, query language, procedural language (PROC), peripheral management, multi-user management and a compiled BASIC Programming language.<ref name=JesInt/>\n\nThe database is a '[[hash table|hash-file]]' data management system.  A hash-file system is a collection of dynamic [[associative array]]s which are organized altogether and linked and controlled using associative files as a database management system.  Being hash-file oriented, Pick provides efficiency in data access time.  Originally, all data structures in Pick were hash-files (at the lowest level) meaning records are stored as associated couplets of a primary key to a set of values.  Today a Pick system can also natively access host files in Windows or Unix in any format.\n\nA Pick database is divided into one or more accounts, master dictionaries, dictionaries, files and sub-files, each of which is a hash-table oriented file.  These files contain records made up of fields, sub-fields and sub-sub-fields.  In Pick, records are called items, fields are called attributes, and sub-fields are called values or sub-values (hence the present-day label \"multivalued database\").  All elements are variable-length, with field and values marked off by special delimiters, so that any file, record, or field may contain any number of entries of the lower level of entity.  As a result, a Pick item (record) can be one complete entity (one entire invoice, purchase order, sales order, etc.), or is like a file on most conventional systems.  Entities that are stored as 'files' in other common-place systems (e.g. source programs and text documents) must be stored as records within files on Pick.<ref name=JesFiles>{{cite web  |url=http://jes.com/pb/pb_wp1.html |title=Accounts and Files}}</ref>\n\nThe file hierarchy is roughly equivalent to the common [[Unix-like]] hierarchy of directories, sub-directories, and files.  The master dictionary is similar to a directory in that it stores pointers to other dictionaries, files and executable programs.  The master dictionary also contains the command-line language.\n\nAll files (accounts, dictionaries, files, sub-files) are organized identically, as are all records.  This uniformity is exploited throughout the system, both by system functions, and by the system administration commands.  For example, the 'find' command will find and report the occurrence of a word or phrase in a file, and can operate on any account, dictionary, file or sub-file.\n\nEach record must have a unique, primary key which determines where in a file that record is stored.  To retrieve a record, its key is [[hash function|hashed]] and the resultant value specifies which of a set of discrete \"buckets\" (called \"groups\") to look in for the record. (Within a bucket, records are scanned sequentially.)  Therefore, most records (e.g. a complete document) can be read using one single disk-read operation.  This same method is used to write the record back to its correct \"bucket\".\n\nIn its initial implementation, Pick records were limited to 32&nbsp;KB in total (when a 10&nbsp;MB hard disk cost [[United States dollar|US$]]5000), although this limit was removed in the 1980s.  Files can contain an unlimited number of records, but retrieval efficiency is determined by the number of records relative to the number of buckets allocated to the file.  Each file may be initially allocated as many buckets as required, although changing this extent later may (for some file types) require the file to be quiescent. All modern multi-value databases have a special file-type which changes extent dynamically as the file is used. These use a technique called linear hashing, whose cost is proportional to the change in file size, not (as in typical hashed files) the file size itself.  All files start as a contiguous group of disk pages, and grow by linking additional \"overflow\" pages from unused disk space.\n\nInitial Pick implementations had no index structures as they were not deemed necessary.  Around 1990, a [[B-tree]] indexing feature was added.  This feature makes secondary key look-ups operate much like keyed inquiries of any other database system: requiring at least two disk reads (a key read then a data-record read).\n\nPick data files are usually two levels. The first level is known as the \"dictionary\" level and is mandatory. It contains:\n\n* Dictionary items{{snd}}the optional items that serve as definitions for the names and structure of the items in the data fork, used in reporting\n* The data-level identifier{{snd}}a pointer to the second or \"data\" level of the file\n\nFiles created with only one level are, by default, dictionary files. Some versions of the Pick system allow multiple data levels to be linked to one dictionary level file, in which case there would be multiple data-level identifiers in the dictionary file.\n\nA Pick database has no [[data typing]],<ref name=JesDTypes>{{cite web  \n|url=http://jes.com/pb/pb_wp6.html |title=String-Handling Intrinsic Functions}}</ref> since all data is stored as characters, including numbers (which are stored as character decimal digits).  Data [[integrity]], rather than being controlled by the system, is controlled by the applications and the discipline of the programmers.  Because a logical document in Pick is not fragmented (as it would be in SQL), intra-record integrity is automatic.\n\nIn contrast to many [[SQL]] [[database system]]s, Pick allows for multiple, pre-computed field aliases.  For example, a date field may have an alias definition for the format \"12 Oct 1999\", and another alias formatting that same date field as \"10/12/99\".  File cross-connects or joins are handled as a synonym definition of the foreign key.  A customer's data, such as name and address, are \"joined\" from the customer file into the invoice file via a synonym definition of \"customer number\" in the \"invoice\" dictionary.\n\nPick record structure favors a non-first-normal-form composition, where all of the data for an entity is stored in a single record, obviating the need to perform [[Join (SQL)|join]]s.  Managing large, sparse data sets in this way can result in efficient use of storage space. This is why these databases are sometimes called NF2 or NF-squared databases.\n\n==History==\nPick was originally implemented as the '''G'''eneralized '''I'''nformation '''R'''etrieval '''L'''anguage '''S'''ystem (GIRLS) on an [[IBM System/360]] in 1965 by Don Nelson and Richard (Dick) Pick at [[TRW Inc.|TRW]], whose government contract for the Cheyenne Helicopter project required developing a database.<ref name=\"CP\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.jes.com/cdp/cdp_faqx.html   |title=General Overview of Classic Pick - a short history   |date=1995}}</ref> It was supposed to be used by the [[U.S. Army]] to control the inventory of [[Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne|Cheyenne helicopter]] parts.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Donald B.

A PROC procedure language was provided for executing [[scripting language|scripts]].  A [[SQL]]-style language called ENGLISH allowed database retrieval and reporting, but not updates (although later, the ENGLISH command \"REFORMAT\" allowed updates on a batch basis).  ENGLISH did not fully allow manipulating the 3-dimensional multivalued structure of data records. Nor did it directly provide common [[relational database|relational]] capabilities such as [[join (SQL)|join]]s. This was because powerful [[data dictionary]] redefinitions for a field allowed [[join (SQL)|join]]s via the execution of a calculated lookup in another file.  The system included a [[spooler]].  A simple [[text editor]] for file-system records was provided, but the editor was only suitable<ref name=SiskProGuide>{{cite web\n|url=http://jes.com/pb/pb_wp2.html |title=Jonathan E.

The Pick database was licensed to roughly three dozen licensees between 1978 and 1984, some of which are included in this list. Application-compatible implementations evolved into derivatives and also inspired similar systems.\n\nThese implementations are split up into three basic divisions:\n\n* Hardware: The operating system and database were based in [[firmware]]. On the assembler level, all references were to addresses on the disk, rather than RAM.\n* Software: Intermediate software translated the already existing programming into the native machine language, usually on microprocessors.\n* Guest [[operating environment]]s: The system and database were implemented in an application that simulated most of the Pick functions, like the Basic and retrieval languages. In general, they depended on their host operating systems for everything else, from disk mapping to security.\n\n; Reality : The first implementation of the Pick database was on a Microdata platform using firmware and called [[Northgate Information Solutions|Reality]].  The first commercial release was in 1973. Microdata acquired CMC Ltd. in the early 80s and were based in Hemel Hempstead, England.  The Microdata implementations ran in [[firmware]], so each upgrade had to be accompanied by a new configuration chip.  Microdata itself was eventually bought by McDonnell-Douglas Information Systems.  Pick and Microdata sued each other for the right to market the database, the final judgment being that they both had the right. In addition to the [[Northgate Information Solutions|Reality]]Sequoia and Pegasus] series of computers, Microdata and CMC Ltd. sold the Sequel(Sequoia) series which was a much larger class able to handle over 1000 simultaneous users. The earlier Reality minicomputers were known to handle well over 200 simultaneous users, although things got pretty slow and it was above the official limit. Pegasus systems superseded Sequoia and could handle even more simultaneous users than its predecessors.  The modern version of this original Pick implementation is owned and distributed by [http://www.northgate-is.com/reality Northgate Information Solutions Reality].\n; Ultimate : The second implementation of the Pick database was developed in about 1978 by a [[New Jersey]] company called The Ultimate Corp, run by [[Ted Sabarese]].  Like the earlier Microdata port, this was a firmware implementation, with the Pick instruction set in firmware and the monitor in assembly code on a [[Honeywell Level 6]] machine. The system had dual personalities in that the monitor/kernel functions (mostly hardware I/O and scheduling)  were executed by the native Honeywell Level 6 instruction set.  When the monitor  \"select next user\" for activation control was passed to the Honeywell WCS (writable control store) to execute Pick assembler code (implemented in microcode) for the selected process.  When the user's time slice expired control was passed back to the kernel running the native Level 6 instruction set.\n\n:Ultimate took this concept further with the DEC LSI/11 family of products by implementing a co-processor in hardware (bit-slice, firmware driven).  Instead of a single processor with a WCS microcode enhanced instruction set, this configuration used two independent but cooperating CPUs.  The LSI11 CPU executed the monitor functions and the co-processor executed the Pick assembler instruction set.  The efficiencies of this approach resulted in a 2\u00d7 performance improvement.\n\n:The co-processor concept was used again to create a 5X, 7x and dual-7x versions for Honeywell Level 6 systems.  Dual ported memory with private busses to the co-processors were used to increase performance of the LSI11 and Level 6 systems.\n\n:Another version used a DEC [[LSI-11]] for the IOP and a 7X board. Ultimate enjoyed moderate success during the 1980s, and even included an implementation running as a layer on top of DEC VAX systems, the 750, 780, 785 and later the [[MicroVAX]]. Ultimate also had versions of the Ultimate Operating System running on IBM 370 series systems (under VM and native) and also the 9370 series computers.  Ultimate was renamed Allerion, Inc., before liquidation of its assets.  Most assets were acquired by [[Groupe Bull]], and consisted of mostly maintaining extant hardware.  Bull had its own problems and in approximately 1994 the US maintenance operation was sold to [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]].\n\n; Prime INFORMATION : Devcom, a Microdata reseller, wrote a Pick-style database system called INFORMATION in [[FORTRAN]] and assembler in 1979 to run on [[Prime Computer]] 50-series systems. It was then sold to [[Prime Computer]] and renamed Prime INFORMATION.<ref>{{cite newspaper  |newspaper=Computerworld |date=March 24, 1986  |page=93\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MskyBf-SNfUC\n|title=In Depth - Pick Operating System}}</ref> It was subsequently sold to Vmark Software. This was the first of the guest operating environment implementations. INFO/BASIC, a variant of [[Dartmouth BASIC]],<ref name=JesInt>{{cite web\n|url=http://jes.com/pb/pb_wp0.html |title=About PICK/BASIC}}</ref> was used for database applications.\n; UniVerse : Another implementation of the system called [[Rocket U2|UniVerse]] was by VMark Software, which operated under Unix and Windows.  This was the first one to incorporate the ability to emulate other implementations of the system, such as Microdata's [[Northgate Information Solutions|Reality]] Operating System, and Prime INFORMATION. Originally running on [[Unix]], it was later also made available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. It now is owned by Rocket Software. (The systems developed by [[Prime Computer]] and VMark are now owned by [[Rocket Software]] and referred to as \"U2\".)\n; UniData : Very similar to UniVerse but [[Rocket U2|UniData]] had facilities to interact with other Windows applications. It is also owned and distributed by Rocket Software.\n; PI/open : [[Prime Computer]] rewrote Prime INFORMATION in C for the [[Unix]]-based systems it was selling, calling it PI+. It was then ported to other Unix systems offered by other hardware vendors and renamed PI/open.\n; ADDS : ([[Applied Digital Data Systems]]) This was the first implementation to be done in software only, so upgrades were accomplished by a tape load, rather than a new chip. The \"Mentor\" line was initially based on the Zilog Z-8000 chipset and this port set off a flurry of other \"''software implementations''\" across a wide array of processors with a large emphasis on the [[Motorola 68000]].\n; Fujitsu  Microsystems of America: Another software implementation, existing in the late 1980s.

[http://openqm.com/ OpenQM] is available from its exclusive worldwide distributor, [http://www.zumasys.com/products/openqm Zumasys].\n; Cach\u00e9 : In 2005 [[InterSystems]], the maker of [[Cach\u00e9 (software)|Cach\u00e9]] database, announced support for a broad set of [[MultiValue]] extensions in Cach\u00e9. [http://www.intersystems.com/mv/index.html Cach\u00e9 for MultiValue].\n; ONware : ONware equips [[MultiValue]] applications with the ability to use the common databases, such as Oracle and SQL Server. Using ONware, [[MultiValue]] applications can be integrated with Relational, Object and Object-Relational applications.\n; D3 : Pick Systems ported the Pick operating system to run as a database product utilizing host operating systems such as Unix, Linux or Windows servers, with the data stored within the file system of the host operating system. Previous Unix or Windows versions had to run in a separate partition, which made interfacing with other applications difficult. The D3 releases opened the possibility of integrating internet access to the database or interfacing to popular word processing and spreadsheet applications, which has been successfully demonstrated by a number of users. The D3 family of databases and related tools is owned and distributed by Rocket Software.\n\nThrough the implementations above, and others, Pick-like systems became available as database/programming/emulation environments running under many variants of [[Unix]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\nOver the years, many important and widely used applications have been written using Pick or one of the derivative implementations{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. In general, the end users of these applications are unaware of the underlying Pick implementation.\n\n==Criticisms and comparisons==\n{{POV check|date=June 2013|section}}\n\n===Run-time environment===\nNative Pick did not need another underlying operating system to run. All of the early versions of Pick ran without another operating system.  However modern implementations of the Pick operating system need a host OS (Windows, Linux, Unix, etc.) to exist. The host OS provides access to hardware resources (processor, memory, storage, etc.), but Pick also has its own process and memory management internal to itself. (Purportedly object-oriented solutions like Cach\u00e9 may address these problems.)\n\nModern networking in mvBase (one of the more popular implementations) is not possible without a side-car application running in the host OS that translates network connections (TCP ports) to Pick's native implementation of networking, serial connections.\n\n===Credentials and security===\n\nIndividual user accounts must be created within the Pick OS, and cannot be tied to an external source (such as local accounts on the host OS, or [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]]).\n\nUser passwords are stored within the Pick OS as an encrypted value. The encrypted password can be \"cracked\" via brute force methods, but requires system access and Pick programming skills as part of the attack vector.\n\nThe Rocket D3 implementation supports SSL file encryption. [http://www.rocketsoftware.com/news/rocket-software-launches-new-version-rocket-d3-database-management-system]\n\n===Expertise and support===\nCompanies looking to hire developers and support personnel for MultiValue-based (Pick-based) systems recognize that although developers typically do not learn the environment in college and university courses, developers can be productive quickly with some mentoring and training. Due to the efficient design and nature of the programming language (a variant of BASIC), the learning curve is generally considered low. Pick products such as D3, UniVerse, UniData, jBASE, Revelation, MVON, Cach\u00e9, OpenQM, and Reality are still supported globally via well established distribution channels and resellers. The mvdbms Google Group is a useful place to start when looking for resources.\n\n===MUMPS ===\nThe Pick OS invites comparison with [[MUMPS]],<ref>A 1980's \"shootout\" had Pick \"still going after 30\" minutes whereas MUMPS had \nfinished sort 100,000 \"in less than a minute.\"{{cite web\n|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/hardhats-members@lists.sourceforge.net/msg04639.html |title=BIG NEWS}}</ref> which evolved into [[Cach\u00e9 (software)|Cach\u00e9]]. Similarities include:\n\n* Both systems are built on the efficient implementation of large, sparse, string-indexed arrays;\n* Both historically commingled the language and the OS;\n* Both have a similar domain of applicability.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pragma (periodical)|Pragma]], a 1980s publication for Pick users\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''The REALITY Pocket Guide'' ; Jonathan E.

Although Pick started on a variety of [[minicomputer]]s, the system and its various implementations eventually spread to a large assortment of [[microcomputer]]s, personal computers<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|date=July 27, 1987|title=PICK Operating System - brings Mainframe Power to your PC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6DsEAAAAMBAJ|magazine=InfoWorld|page=80|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[mainframe computer]]s.<ref>it was actually developed on an IBM mainframe</ref><ref name=CP/>\n\n==Overview==\nThe Pick operating system consists of a database, dictionary, query language, procedural language (PROC), peripheral management, multi-user management and a compiled BASIC Programming language.<ref name=JesInt/>\n\nThe database is a '[[hash table|hash-file]]' data management system.  A hash-file system is a collection of dynamic [[associative array]]s which are organized altogether and linked and controlled using associative files as a database management system.  Being hash-file oriented, Pick provides efficiency in data access time.  Originally, all data structures in Pick were hash-files (at the lowest level) meaning records are stored as associated couplets of a primary key to a set of values.  Today a Pick system can also natively access host files in Windows or Unix in any format.\n\nA Pick database is divided into one or more accounts, master dictionaries, dictionaries, files and sub-files, each of which is a hash-table oriented file.  These files contain records made up of fields, sub-fields and sub-sub-fields.  In Pick, records are called items, fields are called attributes, and sub-fields are called values or sub-values (hence the present-day label \"multivalued database\").  All elements are variable-length, with field and values marked off by special delimiters, so that any file, record, or field may contain any number of entries of the lower level of entity.  As a result, a Pick item (record) can be one complete entity (one entire invoice, purchase order, sales order, etc.), or is like a file on most conventional systems.  Entities that are stored as 'files' in other common-place systems (e.g. source programs and text documents) must be stored as records within files on Pick.<ref name=JesFiles>{{cite web  |url=http://jes.com/pb/pb_wp1.html |title=Accounts and Files}}</ref>\n\nThe file hierarchy is roughly equivalent to the common [[Unix-like]] hierarchy of directories, sub-directories, and files.  The master dictionary is similar to a directory in that it stores pointers to other dictionaries, files and executable programs.  The master dictionary also contains the command-line language.\n\nAll files (accounts, dictionaries, files, sub-files) are organized identically, as are all records.  This uniformity is exploited throughout the system, both by system functions, and by the system administration commands.  For example, the 'find' command will find and report the occurrence of a word or phrase in a file, and can operate on any account, dictionary, file or sub-file.\n\nEach record must have a unique, primary key which determines where in a file that record is stored.  To retrieve a record, its key is [[hash function|hashed]] and the resultant value specifies which of a set of discrete \"buckets\" (called \"groups\") to look in for the record. (Within a bucket, records are scanned sequentially.)  Therefore, most records (e.g. a complete document) can be read using one single disk-read operation.  This same method is used to write the record back to its correct \"bucket\".\n\nIn its initial implementation, Pick records were limited to 32&nbsp;KB in total (when a 10&nbsp;MB hard disk cost [[United States dollar|US$]]5000), although this limit was removed in the 1980s.  Files can contain an unlimited number of records, but retrieval efficiency is determined by the number of records relative to the number of buckets allocated to the file.  Each file may be initially allocated as many buckets as required, although changing this extent later may (for some file types) require the file to be quiescent. All modern multi-value databases have a special file-type which changes extent dynamically as the file is used. These use a technique called linear hashing, whose cost is proportional to the change in file size, not (as in typical hashed files) the file size itself.  All files start as a contiguous group of disk pages, and grow by linking additional \"overflow\" pages from unused disk space.\n\nInitial Pick implementations had no index structures as they were not deemed necessary.  Around 1990, a [[B-tree]] indexing feature was added.  This feature makes secondary key look-ups operate much like keyed inquiries of any other database system: requiring at least two disk reads (a key read then a data-record read).\n\nPick data files are usually two levels. The first level is known as the \"dictionary\" level and is mandatory. It contains:\n\n* Dictionary items{{snd}}the optional items that serve as definitions for the names and structure of the items in the data fork, used in reporting\n* The data-level identifier{{snd}}a pointer to the second or \"data\" level of the file\n\nFiles created with only one level are, by default, dictionary files. Some versions of the Pick system allow multiple data levels to be linked to one dictionary level file, in which case there would be multiple data-level identifiers in the dictionary file.\n\nA Pick database has no [[data typing]],<ref name=JesDTypes>{{cite web  \n|url=http://jes.com/pb/pb_wp6.html |title=String-Handling Intrinsic Functions}}</ref> since all data is stored as characters, including numbers (which are stored as character decimal digits).  Data [[integrity]], rather than being controlled by the system, is controlled by the applications and the discipline of the programmers.  Because a logical document in Pick is not fragmented (as it would be in SQL), intra-record integrity is automatic.\n\nIn contrast to many [[SQL]] [[database system]]s, Pick allows for multiple, pre-computed field aliases.  For example, a date field may have an alias definition for the format \"12 Oct 1999\", and another alias formatting that same date field as \"10/12/99\".  File cross-connects or joins are handled as a synonym definition of the foreign key.  A customer's data, such as name and address, are \"joined\" from the customer file into the invoice file via a synonym definition of \"customer number\" in the \"invoice\" dictionary.\n\nPick record structure favors a non-first-normal-form composition, where all of the data for an entity is stored in a single record, obviating the need to perform [[Join (SQL)|join]]s.  Managing large, sparse data sets in this way can result in efficient use of storage space. This is why these databases are sometimes called NF2 or NF-squared databases.\n\n==History==\nPick was originally implemented as the '''G'''eneralized '''I'''nformation '''R'''etrieval '''L'''anguage '''S'''ystem (GIRLS) on an [[IBM System/360]] in 1965 by Don Nelson and Richard (Dick) Pick at [[TRW Inc.|TRW]], whose government contract for the Cheyenne Helicopter project required developing a database.<ref name=\"CP\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.jes.com/cdp/cdp_faqx.html   |title=General Overview of Classic Pick - a short history   |date=1995}}</ref> It was supposed to be used by the [[U.S. Army]] to control the inventory of [[Lockheed AH-56 Cheyenne|Cheyenne helicopter]] parts.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Donald B.

A [[SQL]]-style language called ENGLISH allowed database retrieval and reporting, but not updates (although later, the ENGLISH command \"REFORMAT\" allowed updates on a batch basis).  ENGLISH did not fully allow manipulating the 3-dimensional multivalued structure of data records. Nor did it directly provide common [[relational database|relational]] capabilities such as [[join (SQL)|join]]s. This was because powerful [[data dictionary]] redefinitions for a field allowed [[join (SQL)|join]]s via the execution of a calculated lookup in another file.  The system included a [[spooler]].  A simple [[text editor]] for file-system records was provided, but the editor was only suitable<ref name=SiskProGuide>{{cite web\n|url=http://jes.com/pb/pb_wp2.html |title=Jonathan E.

The Pick database was licensed to roughly three dozen licensees between 1978 and 1984, some of which are included in this list. Application-compatible implementations evolved into derivatives and also inspired similar systems.\n\nThese implementations are split up into three basic divisions:\n\n* Hardware: The operating system and database were based in [[firmware]]. On the assembler level, all references were to addresses on the disk, rather than RAM.\n* Software: Intermediate software translated the already existing programming into the native machine language, usually on microprocessors.\n* Guest [[operating environment]]s: The system and database were implemented in an application that simulated most of the Pick functions, like the Basic and retrieval languages. In general, they depended on their host operating systems for everything else, from disk mapping to security.\n\n; Reality : The first implementation of the Pick database was on a Microdata platform using firmware and called [[Northgate Information Solutions|Reality]].  The first commercial release was in 1973. Microdata acquired CMC Ltd. in the early 80s and were based in Hemel Hempstead, England.  The Microdata implementations ran in [[firmware]], so each upgrade had to be accompanied by a new configuration chip.  Microdata itself was eventually bought by McDonnell-Douglas Information Systems.  Pick and Microdata sued each other for the right to market the database, the final judgment being that they both had the right. In addition to the [[Northgate Information Solutions|Reality]]Sequoia and Pegasus] series of computers, Microdata and CMC Ltd. sold the Sequel(Sequoia) series which was a much larger class able to handle over 1000 simultaneous users. The earlier Reality minicomputers were known to handle well over 200 simultaneous users, although things got pretty slow and it was above the official limit. Pegasus systems superseded Sequoia and could handle even more simultaneous users than its predecessors.  The modern version of this original Pick implementation is owned and distributed by [http://www.northgate-is.com/reality Northgate Information Solutions Reality].\n; Ultimate : The second implementation of the Pick database was developed in about 1978 by a [[New Jersey]] company called The Ultimate Corp, run by [[Ted Sabarese]].  Like the earlier Microdata port, this was a firmware implementation, with the Pick instruction set in firmware and the monitor in assembly code on a [[Honeywell Level 6]] machine. The system had dual personalities in that the monitor/kernel functions (mostly hardware I/O and scheduling)  were executed by the native Honeywell Level 6 instruction set.  When the monitor  \"select next user\" for activation control was passed to the Honeywell WCS (writable control store) to execute Pick assembler code (implemented in microcode) for the selected process.  When the user's time slice expired control was passed back to the kernel running the native Level 6 instruction set.\n\n:Ultimate took this concept further with the DEC LSI/11 family of products by implementing a co-processor in hardware (bit-slice, firmware driven).  Instead of a single processor with a WCS microcode enhanced instruction set, this configuration used two independent but cooperating CPUs.  The LSI11 CPU executed the monitor functions and the co-processor executed the Pick assembler instruction set.  The efficiencies of this approach resulted in a 2\u00d7 performance improvement.\n\n:The co-processor concept was used again to create a 5X, 7x and dual-7x versions for Honeywell Level 6 systems.  Dual ported memory with private busses to the co-processors were used to increase performance of the LSI11 and Level 6 systems.\n\n:Another version used a DEC [[LSI-11]] for the IOP and a 7X board. Ultimate enjoyed moderate success during the 1980s, and even included an implementation running as a layer on top of DEC VAX systems, the 750, 780, 785 and later the [[MicroVAX]]. Ultimate also had versions of the Ultimate Operating System running on IBM 370 series systems (under VM and native) and also the 9370 series computers.  Ultimate was renamed Allerion, Inc., before liquidation of its assets.  Most assets were acquired by [[Groupe Bull]], and consisted of mostly maintaining extant hardware.  Bull had its own problems and in approximately 1994 the US maintenance operation was sold to [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]].\n\n; Prime INFORMATION : Devcom, a Microdata reseller, wrote a Pick-style database system called INFORMATION in [[FORTRAN]] and assembler in 1979 to run on [[Prime Computer]] 50-series systems. It was then sold to [[Prime Computer]] and renamed Prime INFORMATION.<ref>{{cite newspaper  |newspaper=Computerworld |date=March 24, 1986  |page=93\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MskyBf-SNfUC\n|title=In Depth - Pick Operating System}}</ref> It was subsequently sold to Vmark Software. This was the first of the guest operating environment implementations. INFO/BASIC, a variant of [[Dartmouth BASIC]],<ref name=JesInt>{{cite web\n|url=http://jes.com/pb/pb_wp0.html |title=About PICK/BASIC}}</ref> was used for database applications.\n; UniVerse : Another implementation of the system called [[Rocket U2|UniVerse]] was by VMark Software, which operated under Unix and Windows.  This was the first one to incorporate the ability to emulate other implementations of the system, such as Microdata's [[Northgate Information Solutions|Reality]] Operating System, and Prime INFORMATION. Originally running on [[Unix]], it was later also made available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. It now is owned by Rocket Software. (The systems developed by [[Prime Computer]] and VMark are now owned by [[Rocket Software]] and referred to as \"U2\".)\n; UniData : Very similar to UniVerse but [[Rocket U2|UniData]] had facilities to interact with other Windows applications. It is also owned and distributed by Rocket Software.\n; PI/open : [[Prime Computer]] rewrote Prime INFORMATION in C for the [[Unix]]-based systems it was selling, calling it PI+. It was then ported to other Unix systems offered by other hardware vendors and renamed PI/open.\n; ADDS : ([[Applied Digital Data Systems]]) This was the first implementation to be done in software only, so upgrades were accomplished by a tape load, rather than a new chip. The \"Mentor\" line was initially based on the Zilog Z-8000 chipset and this port set off a flurry of other \"''software implementations''\" across a wide array of processors with a large emphasis on the [[Motorola 68000]].\n; Fujitsu  Microsystems of America: Another software implementation, existing in the late 1980s.

[http://openqm.com/ OpenQM] is available from its exclusive worldwide distributor, [http://www.zumasys.com/products/openqm Zumasys].\n; Cach\u00e9 : In 2005 [[InterSystems]], the maker of [[Cach\u00e9 (software)|Cach\u00e9]] database, announced support for a broad set of [[MultiValue]] extensions in Cach\u00e9. [http://www.intersystems.com/mv/index.html Cach\u00e9 for MultiValue].\n; ONware : ONware equips [[MultiValue]] applications with the ability to use the common databases, such as Oracle and SQL Server. Using ONware, [[MultiValue]] applications can be integrated with Relational, Object and Object-Relational applications.\n; D3 : Pick Systems ported the Pick operating system to run as a database product utilizing host operating systems such as Unix, Linux or Windows servers, with the data stored within the file system of the host operating system. Previous Unix or Windows versions had to run in a separate partition, which made interfacing with other applications difficult. The D3 releases opened the possibility of integrating internet access to the database or interfacing to popular word processing and spreadsheet applications, which has been successfully demonstrated by a number of users. The D3 family of databases and related tools is owned and distributed by Rocket Software.\n\nThrough the implementations above, and others, Pick-like systems became available as database/programming/emulation environments running under many variants of [[Unix]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].\n\nOver the years, many important and widely used applications have been written using Pick or one of the derivative implementations{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. In general, the end users of these applications are unaware of the underlying Pick implementation.\n\n==Criticisms and comparisons==\n{{POV check|date=June 2013|section}}\n\n===Run-time environment===\nNative Pick did not need another underlying operating system to run. All of the early versions of Pick ran without another operating system.  However modern implementations of the Pick operating system need a host OS (Windows, Linux, Unix, etc.) to exist. The host OS provides access to hardware resources (processor, memory, storage, etc.), but Pick also has its own process and memory management internal to itself. (Purportedly object-oriented solutions like Cach\u00e9 may address these problems.)\n\nModern networking in mvBase (one of the more popular implementations) is not possible without a side-car application running in the host OS that translates network connections (TCP ports) to Pick's native implementation of networking, serial connections.\n\n===Credentials and security===\n\nIndividual user accounts must be created within the Pick OS, and cannot be tied to an external source (such as local accounts on the host OS, or [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]]).\n\nUser passwords are stored within the Pick OS as an encrypted value. The encrypted password can be \"cracked\" via brute force methods, but requires system access and Pick programming skills as part of the attack vector.\n\nThe Rocket D3 implementation supports SSL file encryption. [http://www.rocketsoftware.com/news/rocket-software-launches-new-version-rocket-d3-database-management-system]\n\n===Expertise and support===\nCompanies looking to hire developers and support personnel for MultiValue-based (Pick-based) systems recognize that although developers typically do not learn the environment in college and university courses, developers can be productive quickly with some mentoring and training. Due to the efficient design and nature of the programming language (a variant of BASIC), the learning curve is generally considered low. Pick products such as D3, UniVerse, UniData, jBASE, Revelation, MVON, Cach\u00e9, OpenQM, and Reality are still supported globally via well established distribution channels and resellers. The mvdbms Google Group is a useful place to start when looking for resources.\n\n===MUMPS ===\nThe Pick OS invites comparison with [[MUMPS]],<ref>A 1980's \"shootout\" had Pick \"still going after 30\" minutes whereas MUMPS had \nfinished sort 100,000 \"in less than a minute.\"{{cite web\n|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/hardhats-members@lists.sourceforge.net/msg04639.html |title=BIG NEWS}}</ref> which evolved into [[Cach\u00e9 (software)|Cach\u00e9]]. Similarities include:\n\n* Both systems are built on the efficient implementation of large, sparse, string-indexed arrays;\n* Both historically commingled the language and the OS;\n* Both have a similar domain of applicability.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pragma (periodical)|Pragma]], a 1980s publication for Pick users\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''The REALITY Pocket Guide'' ; Jonathan E.

There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends\u2014ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building a fire and leaving it to continue his journey, he later attempts to build another fails, then tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fails to do either. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].\n\nThe 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.\n\nThe 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].\n\n==1908 version plot==\nAn unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221259&nbsp;\u00b0C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors \"the boys\" at their camp by six o'clock that evening.\n\nAt half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire\u2014this one under a tree\u2014in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.\n\n==Character relationships==\nThe protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures, but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story.

The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.\n\nOne theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.\n\nThe protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />\n\n\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described \u201cHe did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/perseverance-theme.html|title=To Build a Fire Theme of Perseverance|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\n\"[[Wisdom and Experience]]\" Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience. London shows us throughout the story that the man lacks the knowledge in order to survive in the Yukon.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Welsh |first1=James |title=Masterplots II: Short Story Series |journal=Revised Edition |date=2004 |volume=1 |pages=1\u20133 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/lrc/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=2ee11b99-9eb2-45d3-9942-5949eaec8c5a%40pdc-v-sessmgr03&bdata=JnNpdGU9bHJjLWxpdmU%3d#AN=103331MSS23119240001174&db=lfh |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> Based on instincts, the dog knew that it was too cold to travel in the snow. London wrote: \u201cThe dog was sorry to leave and looked toward the fire.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=\"To Build a Fire\" |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> This line indicates that the dog wanted to be closer to heat. However, the unnamed protagonist ignored all the signs before him. He knew that it was cold but he did not realize the threat this posed on his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/themes.html|title=To Build a Fire Themes|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\nStupidity and arrogance are personified in the story's protagonist. For example, he goes through the extremely cold territory alone, despite going for the first time. He laughs off the crucial advice from the old man of Sulphur Creek about traveling with an acquaintance because he thinks he knows what he's doing. This arrogance results in the protagonist putting himself in a dangerous situation that was preventable. At first, he thinks it's nothing and that everything will be fine. By the end of the story, he dies as a result of his arrogance. Through this story, London shows how the man's demise is due to his humanity and lack of thought when going into this journey. Also, he shows that the dog survives because of following its instincts which is something that the man does not pay attention to.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowen |first1=James |title='To Build a Fire': Epistemology and the White Wilderness |journal=Western American Literature |date=1971 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=287\u2013289|doi=10.1353/wal.1971.0004 }}</ref> Another example of arrogance occurs when the protagonist disregards the possibility that there may be situations he cannot overcome. The old man warns the protagonist of this and also seems to have a better understanding of the natural world, respecting the fact that there are some situations the man will be unable to control. Not only does the old man see the protagonist's stupidity, but the dog notices the man's lack of knowledge about the terrain and its obstacles after he fails to keep a fire going.\n\nSuccumbing to death is another theme in the story: more specifically the peace that may be found in death. London foreshadows the death of the man early in the story, so it is not a surprise that the man dies. However, London depicts death quite differently than many other authors do. The man drifts off into a calm, peaceful slumber devoid of suffering and pain. London's use of relaxing words dissuades the reader from feeling a great deal of sympathy for the man, as the death is merciful and graciously anticipated, rather than sad. In contrast to more dramatic depictions of death, London's depiction reveals death as a peaceful escape from tumult and pain.\n\nIndividualism is another common theme London portrays in the story. The man only relies on himself to get him through the Yukon; he doesn't believe that he needs any help. This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/cview.cgi/jmurj/vol4/iss1/7|title=James Madison University \u2013 Log in |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |website=commons.lib.jmu.edu |url-access=registration |access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==1902 version==\nThe earlier version was first published in ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' on May 29, 1902.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=London |first=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/writings/Uncollected/tobuildafire.html |magazine=Youth's Companion |volume=76 |date=May 29, 1902 |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the first, more juvenile version.</ref> Although it differs in some details, the general structure and storyline are similar; the primary differences are as follows: in the first version it is not as cold, there is no dog, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers some permanent frostbite damage but survives, sad but wiser.\n\n==Films==\n*''[[:fr:Construire un feu (film, 1928)|Construire un feu]]'' (1927\u20131928) is an early short film by [[Claude Autant-Lara]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unifrance.org/film/34430/construire-un-feu |title=Construire un feu |language=fr |website=UNIFRANCE |access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019787/combined |title=Construire un feu (1930) |website=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> \n*''To Build a Fire'' (1969) was made by [[David Cobham]], with [[Ian Hogg (actor)|Ian Hogg]] as the man and [[Orson Welles]] as the narrator.<ref name=\"Yahoo\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800395257/info |title=To Build a Fire (1969) |website=Yahoo!

There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends\u2014ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building a fire and leaving it to continue his journey, he later attempts to build another fails, then tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fails to do either. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].\n\nThe 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.\n\nThe 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].\n\n==1908 version plot==\nAn unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221259&nbsp;\u00b0C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors (\"the boys\") at their camp by six o'clock that evening.\n\nAt half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire\u2014this one under a tree\u2014in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.\n\n==Character relationships==\nThe protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story.

This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/cview.cgi/jmurj/vol4/iss1/7|title=James Madison University \u2013 Log in |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |website=commons.lib.jmu.edu |url-access=registration |access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==1902 version==\nThe earlier version was first published in ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' on May 29, 1902.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=London |first=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/writings/Uncollected/tobuildafire.html |magazine=Youth's Companion |volume=76 |date=May 29, 1902 |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the first, more juvenile version.</ref> Although it differs in some details, the general structure and storyline are similar; the primary differences are as follows: in the first version it is not as cold, there is no dog, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers some permanent frostbite damage but survives, sad but wiser.\n\n==Films==\n*''[[:fr:Construire un feu (film, 1928)|Construire un feu]]'' (1927\u20131928) is an early short film by [[Claude Autant-Lara]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unifrance.org/film/34430/construire-un-feu |title=Construire un feu |language=fr |website=UNIFRANCE |access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019787/combined |title=Construire un feu (1930) |website=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> \n*''To Build a Fire'' (1969) was made by [[David Cobham]], with [[Ian Hogg (actor)|Ian Hogg]] as the man and [[Orson Welles]] as the narrator.<ref name=\"Yahoo\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800395257/info |title=To Build a Fire (1969) |website=Yahoo!
