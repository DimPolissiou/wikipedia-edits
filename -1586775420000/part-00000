{"title_page": "Proto-Slavic accent", "text_new": "'''Proto-Slavic accent''' is closely related to the accentual system of some [[Baltic languages]] ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]]) with whom it shares many common innovations that occurred in the [[Proto-Balto-Slavic language|Proto-Balto-Slavic]] period. Deeper, it inherits from the [[Proto-Indo-European accent]]. In modern languages the prototypical accent is reflected in various ways, some preserving the Proto-Slavic situation to a greater degree than others.\n\n==Evolution from Proto-Balto-Slavic==\nProto-Balto-Slavic is reconstructed with a free lexical accent, and a distinction between \"short\" and \"long\" syllables. A long syllable was any syllable containing either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a so-called \"sonorant diphthong\" consisting of a short vowel plus ''*l'', ''*m'', ''*n'' or ''*r'' in the syllable coda. Short syllables consisted of a short vowel with either no coda or an obstruent in the coda. The distinction between long and short syllables remained important throughout the early history of Slavic.\n\nLong vowels were present in Proto-Balto-Slavic, and remained in Proto-Slavic as well. However, alongside the distinctions in quantity, Slavic also developed distinctions in quality between short and long vowels:\n* Short ''*a'' was rounded to ''*o''.\n* Short ''*i'' and ''*u'' were lowered to ''*\u044c'' and ''*\u044a'', and later often lost through [[Havl\u00edk's law]]. Long ''*\u016b'' was unrounded to ''*y''.\n* Long ''*\u0113'' was lowered to ''*\u011b''.\nThis became important towards the end of the Proto-Slavic period, where certain dialects acquired new long and short vowels distinct from the older ones, based on these differences in quality.\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic long syllables could bear a suprasegmental feature known as ''acute''. The acute feature could occur independently of the accent, and Slavic retained this situation until at least the operation of [[Dybo's law]]. This sound change shifted the accent one syllable rightwards if it previously fell on a non-acuted syllable (whether short or long), and the syllable that the accent shifted onto still had the acute-nonacute distinction at this time. However, by the time of [[Iv\u0161i\u0107's law]], the acute feature was no longer apparent; the accent retraction that occurred as part of this law produced the same result on all long syllables, regardless of whether it was originally acuted or not. The Slavic accent had changed from being purely positional to also being intonational: the acute was converted to a distinct rising intonation on accented long syllables, and lost elsewhere. Unaccented syllables now distinguished only between long and short.\n\nSlavic also inherited from Proto-Balto-Slavic the distinction between fixed and mobile accentual paradigms in verbs and nominals. In fixed paradigms, the accent was on the same stem syllable in all forms, while in mobile paradigms, it would alternate between the first syllable of the stem and the ending. Fixed paradigms were split in two by the operation of Dybo's law, which created a new ''accent paradigm b'' by shifting the accent onto the ending. The accent was then shifted back again in some forms by [[Iv\u0161i\u0107's law]], creating a new type of mobile pattern. Paradigms which remained fixed were assigned to ''accent paradigm a''. The inherited Balto-Slavic mobile paradigms were not split in this way thanks to [[Meillet's law]], and remained unified in ''accent paradigm c''.\n\n==System==\nThere is no consensus among linguists on the exact prosodical nature of late Proto-Slavic, or Common Slavic. Two different schools of thought exist, the more-or-less \"traditional\" school (exemplified by Jasanoff, Kapovi\u0107 and Olander among others) and the more radical \"Leiden\" school (exemplified by Derksen, Kortlandt and Pronk among others). The most important difference between the two, in the context of the Slavic accent and prosody in general, is that the traditional viewpoint holds that Proto-Slavic retained all length distinctions as they were inherited from Proto-Balto-Slavic, whereas the Leiden school argues that some long vowels were shortened and short vowels were lengthened already in Proto-Slavic. Thus:\n* Traditionally, the old acute is reconstructed as long, but it is reconstructed as short everywhere by the Leiden linguists.\n* The Leiden linguists posit a lengthening of short vowels in \"monosyllables\" (one syllable + final yer), thus allowing for circumflex and long neoacute on originally short vowels. Traditionally, such vowels are considered short in Proto-Slavic, and the long vowels that are found in the later dialects are regarded as Post-Common-Slavic developments.\n\nThe various accent types of Proto-Slavic are indicated with different diacritical symbols. The following table helps map between the notational systems found in various sources. The vowel symbols stand for different vowel classes that the accent can appear on: ''o'' stands for any original short mid vowel, ''\u044a'' stands for any original short high vowel (yer), ''a'' for any original long vowel or liquid diphthong.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Comparison of prosodic notation\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!

Both {{angbr|\u00e1}} and {{angbr|\u00e3}} are used for the neoacute accent for example, reflecting the accents used in standard Shtokavian and Chakavian respectively. Jasanoff uses a vertical mark {{angbr|a\u030d o\u030d \u044a\u030d}} to mark the accent on syllables where the tonality is implied because no contrastive tone exists, using the more specific symbols above only to indicate tonal contrasts.\n\nThe '''old acute''' accent could occur on any syllable of a word ({{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*ba\u030bba}}, {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*lopa\u030bta}}, {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*golva\u030b}}), but only on a long syllable. Phonetically it is usually reconstructed as a rising tone, traditionally long, but short in the Leiden school. Within Balto-Slavic framework this matches with rising intonation of the cognate Latvian \u27e8\u00f5\u27e9 and length marks on the second part of diphthongs in [[Old Prussian]].<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2008|pp=2}}</ref> However, critics of this interpretation claim that one can hardly derive the Serbo-Croatian short falling tone \u27e8\u020d\u27e9, shortness in Slovak, length in Czech and the rising intonation in Russian pleophony from the former long rising tone.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2008|pp=3}}</ref> Some speculate that Proto-Slavic acute was phonetically in fact something entirely different, e.g. a glottalized syllable comparable to [[st\u00f8d]] in [[Danish language|Danish]], or something similar.\n\nThe '''old short''' and '''circumflex''' accents represent the historical lack of the acute register on the syllable, on short and long syllables respectively.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2008|pp=3}}</ref> They are sometimes referred to as short and long circumflex. In Slavic, they behaved similarly with respect to accent shifts such as Dybo's law, but were differentiated by word position:\n* In initial syllables, both are reconstructed with a falling intonation, and such words were phonologically probably unaccented. That phonological unaccentedness was manifested as a falling tone (which is confirmed by Serbo-Croatian, Slovene and Russian reflexes).\n* In non-initial syllables, the only vowels in this group which could occur were the mid vowels ''e'' and ''o''. [[Iv\u0161i\u0107's law]] had eliminated all circumflex and closed short vowels from non-initial syllables, becoming instead neoacute accents on the preceding syllable. Non-initial accented short vowels bore a rising intonation, although this was noncontrastive.\n\nThe '''neoacute''' accent was a new type of accent that resulted from accent retraction through Iv\u0161i\u0107's law. It is traditionally reconstructed as a rising intonation on the basis of Slovene and Russian, and the description of dialectal [[Chakavian]] Serbo-Croatian \u27e8\u00f5\u27e9 as a rising tone.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2008|pp=3}}</ref> The neoacute occurred in both short and long varieties:\n* The short neoacute had the same intonation as old short vowels on medial syllables, but contrasted with the short falling tone on initial syllables. There is a distinct reflex{{which|date=April 2019}} in Slovak and some Russian dialects.\n* The long neoacute had a distinctive long rising intonation in all syllables. Unlike the other types of long accent, the long neoacute preserved its length in all languages that retain length distinctions.\n\n'''Unaccented''' syllables did not bear contrastive tone, but according to the Leiden school, did have contrastive length. The traditional school does not reconstruct distinctly long unaccented vowels, instead regarding all original long vowels as long within Proto-Slavic.\n\n===Morphophonological theory===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nOr the valence theory.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2019|pp=75-133}}</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo|2006|pp=4-5}}</ref> There is also a third school, namely the \u201cMoscow\u201d Accentological School (\u201cMAS\u201d) (exemplified by Dybo, Nikolaev, Schallert, and now also Kapovi\u0107, among others).<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo|2006|pp=3}}</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|Oslon|2017|pp=299}}</ref> Perhaps, the most important difference from the \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201cLeiden\u201d schools is the use of [[Morphophonology|morphophonological]] valences and the refusal from of the [[Iv\u0161i\u0107's law|Stang's theory]] of the origin of the \u201cnew acute\u201d in all forms as a result of accent retraction.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo, Vladimir; Zamyatina, Galina; Nikolaev, Sergei|1993|pp=7-18}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Prosodic notation\n|-\n! |\n! \u201cMAS\u201d\n|-\n! | Dominant acute\n| | a\u030b\n|-\n! | Dominant circumflex\n| | \u00e3\n|-\n! | Recessive circumflex\n| | \u0203\n|-\n! | Long\n| | \u014d\n|-\n|}\n\nSometimes dominant short {{angbr|\u00f2}} and recessive short {{angbr|\u020d}} are used,<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo, Vladimir; Zamyatina, Galina; Nikolaev, Sergei|1993|pp=16}}</ref> as well as ictus {{angbr|a\u030d or o\u030d}} (vertical mark) to remove prosodic connotations.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo|2000|pp=11}}</ref>\n\nThe '''dominant acute''' (or the old acute) is reconstructed only on the historically long syllables.

Within Balto-Slavic framework, dominant acute corresponds to the Latvian drawling intonation {{angbr|\u00e3}} and length marks on the second part of diphthongs in Old Prussian, and with the Lithuanian acute {{angbr|\u00f3}}.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo|2000|pp=17-20}}</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo, Vladimir; Zamyatina, Galina; Nikolaev, Sergei|1993|pp=16-17}}</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|Nikolaev|2014|pp=151-153}}</ref>\n\nThe '''dominant circumflex''' (or the new acute) is reconstructed on the historically long and short syllables.

Their reflexes in individual Slavic languages are usually marked as ''A'', ''B'', ''C''. Stang's original reconstruction was for nominals (nouns and adjectives), and {{harvcoltxt|Dybo|1963}} subsequently expanded these to Proto-Slavic verbs as well.\n\n'''Accent paradigm a''' words have a fixed accent on one of the syllables of the stem. If the stem is monosyllabic, that syllable will be acute-accented. If the stem is polysyllabic, the accent may be acute, but can also be short on ''e'' and ''o'' (from Dybo's law) or neoacute (from Dybo's law followed by Iv\u0161i\u0107's law).\n\nExamples: {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*b\u00e0ba}} (feminine noun), acc.

Initial short/circumflex always \"jumps\" to the preceding syllable (a [[preposition]] or a [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]) in a phonetic word; e.g. *''n\u0203 r\u01edk\u01eb'' (Serbo-Croatian: ''n\u0201 r\u016bku''). Similarly, if the short/circumflexed word is followed by a word lacking an accent, the accent is transferred onto it: *r\u01edk\u01eb \u017ee\u030d.<ref>This is known as [[Vasi\u013eev-Dolobko's law]] and is attested in [[Old East Slavic]] and [[Middle Bulgarian]].</ref> Examples: {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*nog\u00e0}} (feminine noun), acc. *n\u020dg\u01eb; {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*g\u020fls\u044a}} (masculine noun), gen. *g\u020flsa; {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*zv\u020dno}} (neuter noun), gen. *zv\u020dna; {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*g\u020fld\u044c}} (i-stem noun), gen. *g\u020fldi; {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*d\u020frg\u044a}} ''m'' (adjective), neuter: *d\u020frgo; {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*\u010dini\u030bti}} (verb), second-person plural present *\u010din\u012bte\u030d).\n\n==Developments in Slavic languages==\nThe [[Segment (linguistics)|suprasegmental]] vowel features of modern Slavic languages largely reflect the Proto-Slavic system, and are summarized in the table below.<ref>After {{harvcoltxt|Sussex|Cubberley|2011|pp=154}}.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Suprasegmental features of modern Slavic languages\n|-\n!

Slovincian\n| {{Yes2|Yes}}\n| {{No2|No}}\n| {{Yes2|Yes}}\n| {{Yes2|Yes}}\n|}\n\nProto-Slavic accent remained free and mobile in East Slavic and South Slavic. The only exception in South Slavic is Macedonian which has a fixed stress on the antepenultimate syllable in the [[standard language]], with southern and south-western [[Dialects of Macedonian|Macedonian dialects]] exhibiting fixed penultimate stress, and eastern dialects exhibiting free stress.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Sussex|Cubberley|2011|pp=151}}</ref> In many dialects the original Proto-Slavic accent position has changed its place; e.g. in literary Serbo-Croatian retracting by one syllable which yielded the new rising pitch (the so-called ''Neoshtokavian retraction''), with old accent preserved in nonstandard dialects (Old Shtokavian, [[Chakavian]], [[Kajkavian]]). Beside phonological causes, position of Proto-Slavic accent was often lost due to the leveling out within the mobile paradigm. In Slovene stress shifts occurred in both directions depending on the old pitch and vowel quantity, yielding tonal and stress-based variants of modern literary Slovene. In West Slavic, free accent is attested at the periphery in the northern [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] dialects (including [[Slovincian language|Slovincian]], an archaic dialect extinct since the 1940s) and [[Polabian language|Polabian]] (spoken on [[Elbe]] in northern-central Germany, extinct since the 18th century).\n\nVowel length became distinctive ([[phoneme|phonemic]]) in West and partially South Slavic. In the West Slavic languages it was accompanied by extensive [[Syncope (phonetics)|contraction]] due to the loss of /j/, typically resulting in a long vowel. This process was centered in the Czech area, and covered Russian and Bulgarian areas at its extremes.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Sussex|Cubberley|2011|pp=135}}</ref> This new length is preserved only in Czech and Slovak, but is lost in most other West Slavic varieties. Several West Slavic languages reflect older length contrasts in the form of new quality contrasts, indirectly preserving the distinction. For example, Polish ''\u00f3'' and ''\u0105'' are reflexes of older long vowels, even though they are no longer long. Length was phonemicized in Serbo-Croatian and Slovene, depending on the pitch. In Neoshtokavian Serbo-Croatian no pre-tonic lengths are allowed; i.e. with Neoshtokavian retraction occurring the length of old long accented syllables was retained as a post-tonic length. In Slovene, length is restricted to the stressed position, with the exception of /\u0259/ which is always short.\n\nThe Proto-Slavic three-way opposition of old acute, short/circumflex and neoacute was in its original form lost in all Slavic languages. It was reworked into a two-way opposition, in one of two typical ways:<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Sussex|Cubberley|2011|pp=153}}</ref>\n#Merging old acute and neoacute, contrasting with short/circumflex. In Czech, Slovene and [[Upper Sorbian]] the new opposition become that of quantity (acute merger > long, circumflex > short). In East Slavic, Bulgarian and Macedonian this new quantitative opposition was subsequently lost, and sometimes reinterpreted as stress position (e.g. in the [[pleophony|pleophonic]] reflex in East Slavic, with acute yielding VRV\u0301 and circumflex yielding V\u0301RV)\n#Merging old acute and short/circumflex, contrasting with neoacute. In Slovak, Polish and [[Lower Sorbian]] the new opposition become that of quantity (neoacute > long, old acute and circumflex > short). In Serbo-Croatian and Slovene the new opposition become that of pitch (neoacute > rising, old acute and circumflex > falling).

All accents became falling in pitch. Only length distinctions remained, with the old acute, short neoacute and short accent being reflected as short, and the circumflex and long neoacute being reflected as long. In monosyllables, the short accent was lengthened. Length remained in some cases in unaccented syllables.\n\nThe ''Neoshtokavian retraction'' reintroduced pitch distinctions. All non-initial accents were retracted, producing a rising accent on the newly accented syllable. Both the newly-accented and the originally-accented syllables kept their length. In initial syllables, the new rising accent contrasted with the old falling accent, which remained. In non-initial syllables, only the rising accent could now occur, and the final syllable could not be accented at all.\n\n===Chakavian===\nChakavian accentuation is particularly archaic, and therefore invaluable for reconstructing the Common Slavic situation. The old acute and short neoacute merge with the short accent, all becoming a short falling intonation. The long neoacute and circumflex remain distinct, reflected as long rising and long falling respectively. Thus, there are no pitch distinctions in short syllables, but they remain in long syllables, unlike the earlier stages of Neoshtokavian.\n\nIn a closed syllable before a sonorant, the short falling accent is lengthened, producing different intonation in different dialects. In northern Chakavian, the result is a long rising accent, while in the south there is a long falling accent instead.\n\n===Kajkavian===\nKajkavian accentuation is similar to Slovene. It resembles Slovene in lengthening the old short accent, producing a long falling accent that merges with the old circumflex. However, there is no lengthening in non-final syllables and no progressive accent shift. Thus, the old acute and short neoacute remain short in all syllables. In long syllables, long rising (neoacute) and long falling (circumflex) are distinguished, as in Chakavian.\n\nThe ''neo-circumflex'' is a change shared with Slovene as well. Original short rising (acute and neoacute) syllables were converted to a long falling accent before a long vowel.\n\n===Slovene===\nThe synchronic descriptions of pitch in modern Slovene differ, with some sources using the standard Slavic/Serbo-Croatian terms \"rising\" and \"falling\", while others describe these as \"low\" and \"high\" respectively. The traditional terms will be used here.\n\nIn the dialectal history of Proto-Slavic, the acute accent was shortened in Slovene, as it was in all neighbouring Serbo-Croatian dialects. It fell together with the short neoacute and was treated identically from there on. Unlike the other languages, however, Slovene kept the old acute and short neoacute distinct from the old short accent in non-final syllables, initially producing a short rising accent that was later lengthened.\n\nThe first change specific to Slovene, the ''progressive accent shift'', shifted the word-initial falling tone (short or circumflex) one syllable to the right. The previously accented syllable became short, while the newly accented syllable was lengthened and received a falling intonation.<ref name=\"Greenberg\">Marc L. Greenberg, ''Word prosody in Slovene from a typological perspective'', 2003</ref> The shift was not completed to its fullest in the more peripheral dialects, notably the dialect of [[Rezija]] which was almost entirely unaffected. It was fully completed in the Ljubljana dialect, on which standard Slovene is based. In monosyllables (whether due to loss of a yer or original), the rightward shift was blocked and the falling accent was lengthened without movement. As a result of these shifts, the distinction between short and circumflex accent was eliminated entirely in Slovene, with all falling accents being automatically long.\n\nFollowing this, the ''neo-circumflex'' arose, a change shared with Kajkavian. Original short rising (acute and neoacute) syllables were converted to a long falling accent under certain conditions, which re-established the falling accent in initial syllables of multisyllabic words. The neo-circumflex arose when the next syllable contained a non-final weak yer or a long vowel. The following long vowel was shortened, and the previous syllable received compensatory lengthening. It also occurred in the ''volja''-type nouns, where the exact explanation varies (according to the Leiden school, the final ''a'' was long).\n\nAround the 14th century, another change occurred to eliminate length contrasts, this time in rising syllables: all non-final rising accents became long, thus merging with the existing long neoacute.<ref name=\"Greenberg\"/> After this change, accented length distinctions existed only in the final syllable. Final short rising accents (old acute or short) were nondistinctively converted to a falling tone; now all rising accents were automatically long.\n\nFollowing this, the accent retracted from word-final short syllables (old acute or short). This change, again, did not reach all dialects. In Standard Slovene, retraction only occurred if the previous syllable was long or if both syllables were open. It also occurred sometimes in Standard Slovene if the preceding syllable contained a schwa (yer), with both the original and the retracted forms standing side by side. The dialect of [[Babno Polje]] went furthest, retracting ''all'' final accents, even long ones that were produced by the forwards circumflex shift above. The retraction produced a long rising vowel, or in the case of schwa, a short rising schwa. Short ''e'' and ''o'' lengthened to distinctive open-mid vowels {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}, contrasting with the close-mid {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} that were produced by earlier lengthenings.\n\nModern Slovene completely lacks length contrasts in unaccented syllables. In accented syllables, length is only distinguished in final syllables, while medial accented syllables are always long.\n\n===Russian===\n\nRussian lost distinctive pitch and length, having instead a free stress accent. A vestige of the former pitch accent remains in the outcome of the liquid diphthongs ''*el'', ''*er'', ''*ol'' and ''*or'', which undergo so-called ''[[pleophony]]''. When these originally bore an acute or neoacute accent, they surface with the accent on the second vowel (''or\u00f3''), while if they had a circumflex accent, they appear with the accent on the first vowel (''\u00f3ro''). This reflects the original rising and falling intonations of these accents.\n\nRussian preserves accent paradigms ''a'' and ''b'' intact, with stem stress and ending stress respectively (or pre-ending stress when there is no ending). A variant known as ''b<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' has stem stress in the instrumental singular.\n\nMobile paradigms have proliferated, however, with [[Andrey Zaliznyak]] distinguishing mobile patterns ''c'', ''d'', ''d<nowiki>'</nowiki>'', ''e'', ''f'', ''f<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' and ''f<nowiki>''</nowiki>''. Paradigms ''c'' and ''e'' have stem accent in the singular and ending accent in the plural, while this is reversed for paradigm ''d'', and paradigm ''f'' has ending stress throughout. Most of the paradigms have one or more anomalous forms that have stem stress where other forms have ending stress.\n\n==Proto-Slavic length==\nBeside the contrastive tone (rising vs. falling), the Late Proto-Slavic also had a vowel quantity (long vs. short) which was phonemically non-distinctive. Vowels were predictably short and thus neutral with respect to length in pretonic positions further away from the accent (stress) than the first pretonic syllable. In other words, long vowels could occur in:<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Vermeer|1986/2010|pp=3}}</ref>\n# the stressed syllable\n# posttonic syllables\n# the first pretonic syllable\n\n[[Old East Slavic]] and [[Old Polish]] loanwords in Finnish, Karelian, Estonian, Lithuanian and Latvian show that the length of the originally long vowels in Slavic (*a, *\u011b, *i, *u, *\u01eb, *\u0119) is retained regardless of the intonation, the position in the word or the number of syllables.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Stang|1957|pp=52\u201355}}</ref> These loanwords show no trace of the old nasality of *\u0119 and *\u01eb which indicates that the original Proto-Slavic length was preserved in all positions and conditions even after the denasalisation of *\u01eb and *\u0119.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2005|pp=3}}</ref>\n\nAfter surveying the data with respect to stress type (acute, short/circumflex, neoacute), the number of the syllables in a word, the position (stressed, pretonic or posttonic) and the accentual paradigm (a, b or c), {{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2005}} offers the following reflexes for West Slavic, and Serbo-Croatian, which have retained distinctive lengths:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!colspan=3 |Common Slavic accented length\n!colspan=2 |Common Slavic pretonic length \n!colspan=2 |Common Slavic posttonic length\n|-\n!\n!Rising\n!Falling\n!New rising\n!In front of less than two moras\n!In front of two moras\n!After short/circumflex (a. p.

Deeper, it inherits from the [[Proto-Indo-European accent]]. In modern languages the prototypical accent is reflected in various ways, some preserving the Proto-Slavic situation to a greater degree than others.\n\n==Evolution from Proto-Balto-Slavic==\nProto-Balto-Slavic is reconstructed with a free lexical accent, and a distinction between \"short\" and \"long\" syllables. A long syllable was any syllable containing either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a so-called \"sonorant diphthong\" consisting of a short vowel plus ''*l'', ''*m'', ''*n'' or ''*r'' in the syllable coda. Short syllables consisted of a short vowel with either no coda or an obstruent in the coda. The distinction between long and short syllables remained important throughout the early history of Slavic.\n\nLong vowels were present in Proto-Balto-Slavic, and remained in Proto-Slavic as well. However, alongside the distinctions in quantity, Slavic also developed distinctions in quality between short and long vowels:\n* Short ''*a'' was rounded to ''*o''.\n* Short ''*i'' and ''*u'' were lowered to ''*\u044c'' and ''*\u044a'', and later often lost through [[Havl\u00edk's law]]. Long ''*\u016b'' was unrounded to ''*y''.\n* Long ''*\u0113'' was lowered to ''*\u011b''.\nThis became important towards the end of the Proto-Slavic period, where certain dialects acquired new long and short vowels distinct from the older ones, based on these differences in quality.\n\nProto-Balto-Slavic long syllables could bear a suprasegmental feature known as ''acute''. The acute feature could occur independently of the accent, and Slavic retained this situation until at least the operation of [[Dybo's law]]. This sound change shifted the accent one syllable rightwards if it previously fell on a non-acuted syllable (whether short or long), and the syllable that the accent shifted onto still had the acute-nonacute distinction at this time. However, by the time of [[Iv\u0161i\u0107's law]], the acute feature was no longer apparent; the accent retraction that occurred as part of this law produced the same result on all long syllables, regardless of whether it was originally acuted or not. The Slavic accent had changed from being purely positional to also being intonational: the acute was converted to a distinct rising intonation on accented long syllables, and lost elsewhere. Unaccented syllables now distinguished only between long and short.\n\nSlavic also inherited from Proto-Balto-Slavic the distinction between fixed and mobile accentual paradigms in verbs and nominals. In fixed paradigms, the accent was on the same stem syllable in all forms, while in mobile paradigms, it would alternate between the first syllable of the stem and the ending. Fixed paradigms were split in two by the operation of Dybo's law, which created a new ''accent paradigm b'' by shifting the accent onto the ending. The accent was then shifted back again in some forms by [[Iv\u0161i\u0107's law]], creating a new type of mobile pattern. Paradigms which remained fixed were assigned to ''accent paradigm a''. The inherited Balto-Slavic mobile paradigms were not split in this way thanks to [[Meillet's law]], and remained unified in ''accent paradigm c''.\n\n==System==\nThere is no consensus among linguists on the exact prosodical nature of late Proto-Slavic, or Common Slavic. Two different schools of thought exist, the more-or-less \"traditional\" school (exemplified by Jasanoff, Kapovi\u0107 and Olander among others) and the more radical \"Leiden\" school (exemplified by Derksen, Kortlandt and Pronk among others). The most important difference between the two, in the context of the Slavic accent and prosody in general, is that the traditional viewpoint holds that Proto-Slavic retained all length distinctions as they were inherited from Proto-Balto-Slavic, whereas the Leiden school argues that some long vowels were shortened and short vowels were lengthened already in Proto-Slavic. Thus:\n* Traditionally, the old acute is reconstructed as long, but it is reconstructed as short everywhere by the Leiden linguists.\n* The Leiden linguists posit a lengthening of short vowels in \"monosyllables\" (one syllable + final yer), thus allowing for circumflex and long neoacute on originally short vowels. Traditionally, such vowels are considered short in Proto-Slavic, and the long vowels that are found in the later dialects are regarded as Post-Common-Slavic developments.\n\nThe various accent types of Proto-Slavic are indicated with different diacritical symbols. The following table helps map between the notational systems found in various sources. The vowel symbols stand for different vowel classes that the accent can appear on: ''o'' stands for any original short mid vowel, ''\u044a'' stands for any original short high vowel (yer), ''a'' for any original long vowel or liquid diphthong.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Comparison of prosodic notation\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!

Both {{angbr|\u00e1}} and {{angbr|\u00e3}} are used for the neoacute accent for example, reflecting the accents used in standard Shtokavian and Chakavian respectively. Jasanoff uses a vertical mark {{angbr|a\u030d o\u030d \u044a\u030d}} to mark the accent on syllables where the tonality is implied because no contrastive tone exists, using the more specific symbols above only to indicate tonal contrasts.\n\nThe '''old acute''' accent could occur on any syllable of a word ({{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*ba\u030bba}}, {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*lopa\u030bta}}, {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*golva\u030b}}), but only on a long syllable. Phonetically it is usually reconstructed as a rising tone, traditionally long, but short in the Leiden school. Within Balto-Slavic framework this matches with rising intonation of the cognate Latvian \u27e8\u00f5\u27e9 and length marks on the second part of diphthongs in [[Old Prussian]].<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2008|pp=2}}</ref> However, critics of this interpretation claim that one can hardly derive the Serbo-Croatian short falling tone \u27e8\u020d\u27e9, shortness in Slovak, length in Czech and the rising intonation in Russian pleophony from the former long rising tone.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2008|pp=3}}</ref> Some speculate that Proto-Slavic acute was phonetically in fact something entirely different, e.g. a glottalized syllable comparable to [[st\u00f8d]] in [[Danish language|Danish]], or something similar.\n\nThe '''old short''' and '''circumflex''' accents represent the historical lack of the acute register on the syllable, on short and long syllables respectively.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2008|pp=3}}</ref> They are sometimes referred to as short and long circumflex. In Slavic, they behaved similarly with respect to accent shifts such as Dybo's law, but were differentiated by word position:\n* In initial syllables, both are reconstructed with a falling intonation, and such words were phonologically probably unaccented. That phonological unaccentedness was manifested as a falling tone (which is confirmed by Serbo-Croatian, Slovene and Russian reflexes).\n* In non-initial syllables, the only vowels in this group which could occur were the mid vowels ''e'' and ''o''. [[Iv\u0161i\u0107's law]] had eliminated all circumflex and closed short vowels from non-initial syllables, becoming instead neoacute accents on the preceding syllable. Non-initial accented short vowels bore a rising intonation, although this was noncontrastive.\n\nThe '''neoacute''' accent was a new type of accent that resulted from accent retraction through Iv\u0161i\u0107's law. It is traditionally reconstructed as a rising intonation on the basis of Slovene and Russian, and the description of dialectal [[Chakavian]] Serbo-Croatian \u27e8\u00f5\u27e9 as a rising tone.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2008|pp=3}}</ref> The neoacute occurred in both short and long varieties:\n* The short neoacute had the same intonation as old short vowels on medial syllables, but contrasted with the short falling tone on initial syllables. There is a distinct reflex{{which|date=April 2019}} in Slovak and some Russian dialects.\n* The long neoacute had a distinctive long rising intonation in all syllables. Unlike the other types of long accent, the long neoacute preserved its length in all languages that retain length distinctions.\n\n'''Unaccented''' syllables did not bear contrastive tone, but according to the Leiden school, did have contrastive length. The traditional school does not reconstruct distinctly long unaccented vowels, instead regarding all original long vowels as long within Proto-Slavic.\n\n===Morphophonological theory===\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nOr the valence theory.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2019|pp=75-133}}</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo|2006|pp=4-5}}</ref> Existing is also a third school, namely the \u201cMoscow\u201d Accentological School (\u201cMAS\u201d) (exemplified by Dybo, Nikolaev, Schallert, and now also Kapovi\u0107, among others).<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo|2006|pp=3}}</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|Oslon|2017|pp=299}}</ref> Perhaps, the most important difference from the \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201cLeiden\u201d schools is the use of [[Morphophonology|morphophonological]] valences and the refusal from of the [[Iv\u0161i\u0107's law|Stang's theory]] of the origin of the \u201cnew acute\u201d in all forms as a result of accent retraction.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo, Vladimir; Zamyatina, Galina; Nikolaev, Sergei|1993|pp=7-18}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Prosodic notation\n|-\n! |\n! \u201cMAS\u201d\n|-\n! | Dominant acute\n| | a\u030b\n|-\n! | Dominant circumflex\n| | \u00e3\n|-\n! | Recessive circumflex\n| | \u0203\n|-\n! | Long\n| | \u014d\n|-\n|}\n\nSometimes dominant short {{angbr|\u00f2}} and recessive short {{angbr|\u020d}} are used,<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo, Vladimir; Zamyatina, Galina; Nikolaev, Sergei|1993|pp=16}}</ref> as well as ictus {{angbr|a\u030d or o\u030d}} (vertical mark) to remove prosodic connotations.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo|2000|pp=11}}</ref>\n\nThe '''dominant acute''' (or the old acute) is reconstructed only on the historically long syllables. Morphophonologically it has a higher (dominant, +) valence. Phonetically reconstructed as an rising-falling syllable tone with a short, but sharp rising part and with a longer falling slope. Within Balto-Slavic framework, dominant acute corresponds to the Latvian drawling intonation {{angbr|\u00e3}} and length marks on the second part of diphthongs in Old Prussian, and with the Lithuanian acute {{angbr|\u00f3}}.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo|2000|pp=17-20}}</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo, Vladimir; Zamyatina, Galina; Nikolaev, Sergei|1993|pp=16-17}}</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|Nikolaev|2014|pp=151-153}}</ref>\n\nThe '''dominant circumflex''' (or the new acute) is reconstructed on the historically long and short syllables. After rejecting the Stang's theory is recognized as a direct reflex of the Proto-Balto-Slavic dominant circumflex. Morphophonologically it has a higher (dominant, +) valence. Phonetically reconstructed as a rising syllable tone. Within Balto-Slavic framework, dominant circumflex corresponds to the Latvian falling intonation {{angbr|\u00e0}} and the Lithuanian circumflex {{angbr|\u00e3}}.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo|2000|pp=17-20}}</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo, Vladimir; Zamyatina, Galina; Nikolaev, Sergei|1993|pp=16-17}}</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|Nikolaev|2014|pp=151-153}}</ref>\n\nThe '''recessive circumflex''' (or the circumflex) is reconstructed on the historically long and short syllables. Morphophonologically it has a lower (recessive, \u2212) valence. Phonetically reconstructed as a falling syllable tone. The historically recessive circumflex emerges from the merger of the Proto-Balto-Slavic recessive circumflex and the [[recessive acute]], which can only be recognized when considering the Latvian data in aggregate. Within Balto-Slavic framework, recessive circumflex corresponds to the Latvian falling intonation {{angbr|\u00e0}} or broken intonation {{angbr|\u00e2}} and the Lithuanian circumflex {{angbr|\u00e3}} or acute {{angbr|\u00f3}}.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo|2000|pp=17-20}}</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo, Vladimir; Zamyatina, Galina; Nikolaev, Sergei|1993|pp=16-17}}</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|Nikolaev|2014|pp=151-153}}</ref>\n\nThe '''long''' is mainly used on final vowels in the word form. A striking example of this is the \u201clong [[yer]]\u201d in the genitive plural.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo, Vladimir; Zamyatina, Galina; Nikolaev, Sergei|1993|pp=22-31}}</ref><ref>{{harvcoltxt|Dybo|2000|pp=37-42}}</ref>\n\n====Dybo's contour rule====\n\n==Proto-Slavic accent paradigms==\nSince {{harvcoltxt|Stang|1957}} three accent paradigms (or ''accent types'') are reconstructed for Proto-Slavic, traditionally marked with letters ''a'', ''b'' and ''c''. Their reflexes in individual Slavic languages are usually marked as ''A'', ''B'', ''C''. Stang's original reconstruction was for nominals (nouns and adjectives), and {{harvcoltxt|Dybo|1963}} subsequently expanded these to Proto-Slavic verbs as well.\n\n'''Accent paradigm a''' words have a fixed accent on one of the syllables of the stem. If the stem is monosyllabic, that syllable will be acute-accented. If the stem is polysyllabic, the accent may be acute, but can also be short on ''e'' and ''o'' (from Dybo's law) or neoacute (from Dybo's law followed by Iv\u0161i\u0107's law).\n\nExamples: {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*b\u00e0ba}} (feminine noun), acc.

The only exception in South Slavic is Macedonian which has a fixed stress on the antepenultimate syllable in the [[standard language]], with southern and south-western [[Dialects of Macedonian|Macedonian dialects]] exhibiting fixed penultimate stress, and eastern dialects exhibiting free stress.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Sussex|Cubberley|2011|pp=151}}</ref> In many dialects the original Proto-Slavic accent position has changed its place; e.g. in literary Serbo-Croatian retracting by one syllable which yielded the new rising pitch (the so-called ''Neoshtokavian retraction''), with old accent preserved in nonstandard dialects (Old Shtokavian, [[Chakavian]], [[Kajkavian]]). Beside phonological causes, position of Proto-Slavic accent was often lost due to the leveling out within the mobile paradigm. In Slovene stress shifts occurred in both directions depending on the old pitch and vowel quantity, yielding tonal and stress-based variants of modern literary Slovene. In West Slavic, free accent is attested at the periphery in the northern [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] dialects (including [[Slovincian language|Slovincian]], an archaic dialect extinct since the 1940s) and [[Polabian language|Polabian]] (spoken on [[Elbe]] in northern-central Germany, extinct since the 18th century).\n\nVowel length became distinctive ([[phoneme|phonemic]]) in West and partially South Slavic. In the West Slavic languages it was accompanied by extensive [[Syncope (phonetics)|contraction]] due to the loss of /j/, typically resulting in a long vowel. This process was centered in the Czech area, and covered Russian and Bulgarian areas at its extremes.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Sussex|Cubberley|2011|pp=135}}</ref> This new length is preserved only in Czech and Slovak, but is lost in most other West Slavic varieties. Several West Slavic languages reflect older length contrasts in the form of new quality contrasts, indirectly preserving the distinction. For example, Polish ''\u00f3'' and ''\u0105'' are reflexes of older long vowels, even though they are no longer long. Length was phonemicized in Serbo-Croatian and Slovene, depending on the pitch. In Neoshtokavian Serbo-Croatian no pre-tonic lengths are allowed; i.e. with Neoshtokavian retraction occurring the length of old long accented syllables was retained as a post-tonic length. In Slovene, length is restricted to the stressed position, with the exception of /\u0259/ which is always short.\n\nThe Proto-Slavic three-way opposition of old acute, short/circumflex and neoacute was in its original form lost in all Slavic languages. It was reworked into a two-way opposition, in one of two typical ways:<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Sussex|Cubberley|2011|pp=153}}</ref>\n#Merging old acute and neoacute, contrasting with short/circumflex. In Czech, Slovene and [[Upper Sorbian]] the new opposition become that of quantity (acute merger > long, circumflex > short). In East Slavic, Bulgarian and Macedonian this new quantitative opposition was subsequently lost, and sometimes reinterpreted as stress position (e.g. in the [[pleophony|pleophonic]] reflex in East Slavic, with acute yielding VRV\u0301 and circumflex yielding V\u0301RV)\n#Merging old acute and short/circumflex, contrasting with neoacute. In Slovak, Polish and [[Lower Sorbian]] the new opposition become that of quantity (neoacute > long, old acute and circumflex > short). In Serbo-Croatian and Slovene the new opposition become that of pitch (neoacute > rising, old acute and circumflex > falling). Subsequently, Neoshtokavian retraction in standard Serbo-Croatian created new tonal oppositions (former pre-tonic > rising, former initially-stressed syllable > falling).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" id=\"correspondences\"\n|+Correspondences of reflexes of Proto-Slavic accent on initial syllable in languages that have retained lengths and/or intonation\n|-\n!Language\n!Number of syllables\n!Old acute\n!Long neoacute\n!Short neoacute\n!Circumflex\n!Short\n|-\n!rowspan=3 | Neoshtokavian Serbo-Croatian\n|one\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;\n|-\n|two\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;\n|-\n|three\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|-\n!rowspan=3 | Chakavian Serbo-Croatian\n|one\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;\n|-\n|two\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;\n|-\n|three\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|-\n!rowspan=3 | Old Shtokavian Serbo-Croatian\n|one\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;\n|-\n|two\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;\n|-\n|three\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|-\n!rowspan=3 | Kajkavian Serbo-Croatian\n|one\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;\n|-\n|two\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;o&#124;\n|-\n|three\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;\u020f&#124;o&#124;\n|-\n!rowspan=3 | Slovene\n|one\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;\n|&#124;\u020d&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;\n|&#124;\u020f&#124;\n|-\n|two\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;\u020f&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;\u020f&#124;\n|-\n|three\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u00f3&#124;o&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;\u020f&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;\u020f&#124;o&#124;\n|-\n!rowspan=3 | Czech\n|one\n|&#124;\u014d&#124;\n|&#124;\u014d&#124;\n|&#124;\u014d&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;\n|-\n|two\n|&#124;\u014d&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;\u014d&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;\u014d&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|-\n|three\n|&#124;o&#124;&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;\u014d&#124;\u014d&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;\u014d&#124;&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|-\n!rowspan=3 | Slovak\n|one\n|&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;\u014d&#124;\n|&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;\n|-\n|two\n|&#124;o&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;\u014d&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|-\n|three\n|&#124;o&#124;&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;\u014d&#124;&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|&#124;o&#124;&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;&#124;\n|}\n''Serbo-Croatian'': \u020d = short falling, \u020f = long falling, \u00f2 = short rising, \u00f3 = long rising, o = short vowel without distinctive tone<br/>\n''Slovene'': \u020d = short falling, \u020f = long falling, \u00f3 = long rising, o = short vowel without distinctive tone<br/>\n''Czech and Slovak'': \u014d = long vowel, o = short vowel, |&nbsp;| = either long or short vowel\n\n===Neoshtokavian===\nThe Neoshtokavian variant of Serbo-Croatian, on which all standard languages are based, initially lost all pitch distinctions. All accents became falling in pitch. Only length distinctions remained, with the old acute, short neoacute and short accent being reflected as short, and the circumflex and long neoacute being reflected as long. In monosyllables, the short accent was lengthened. Length remained in some cases in unaccented syllables.\n\nThe ''Neoshtokavian retraction'' reintroduced pitch distinctions. All non-initial accents were retracted, producing a rising accent on the newly accented syllable. Both the newly-accented and the originally-accented syllables kept their length. In initial syllables, the new rising accent contrasted with the old falling accent, which remained. In non-initial syllables, only the rising accent could now occur, and the final syllable could not be accented at all.\n\n===Chakavian===\nChakavian accentuation is particularly archaic, and therefore invaluable for reconstructing the Common Slavic situation. The old acute and short neoacute merge with the short accent, all becoming a short falling intonation. The long neoacute and circumflex remain distinct, reflected as long rising and long falling respectively. Thus, there are no pitch distinctions in short syllables, but they remain in long syllables, unlike the earlier stages of Neoshtokavian.\n\nIn a closed syllable before a sonorant, the short falling accent is lengthened, producing different intonation in different dialects. In northern Chakavian, the result is a long rising accent, while in the south there is a long falling accent instead.\n\n===Kajkavian===\nKajkavian accentuation is similar to Slovene. It resembles Slovene in lengthening the old short accent, producing a long falling accent that merges with the old circumflex. However, there is no lengthening in non-final syllables and no progressive accent shift. Thus, the old acute and short neoacute remain short in all syllables. In long syllables, long rising (neoacute) and long falling (circumflex) are distinguished, as in Chakavian.\n\nThe ''neo-circumflex'' is a change shared with Slovene as well. Original short rising (acute and neoacute) syllables were converted to a long falling accent before a long vowel.\n\n===Slovene===\nThe synchronic descriptions of pitch in modern Slovene differ, with some sources using the standard Slavic/Serbo-Croatian terms \"rising\" and \"falling\", while others describe these as \"low\" and \"high\" respectively. The traditional terms will be used here.\n\nIn the dialectal history of Proto-Slavic, the acute accent was shortened in Slovene, as it was in all neighbouring Serbo-Croatian dialects. It fell together with the short neoacute and was treated identically from there on. Unlike the other languages, however, Slovene kept the old acute and short neoacute distinct from the old short accent in non-final syllables, initially producing a short rising accent that was later lengthened.\n\nThe first change specific to Slovene, the ''progressive accent shift'', shifted the word-initial falling tone (short or circumflex) one syllable to the right. The previously accented syllable became short, while the newly accented syllable was lengthened and received a falling intonation.<ref name=\"Greenberg\">Marc L. Greenberg, ''Word prosody in Slovene from a typological perspective'', 2003</ref> The shift was not completed to its fullest in the more peripheral dialects, notably the dialect of [[Rezija]] which was almost entirely unaffected. It was fully completed in the Ljubljana dialect, on which standard Slovene is based. In monosyllables (whether due to loss of a yer or original), the rightward shift was blocked and the falling accent was lengthened without movement. As a result of these shifts, the distinction between short and circumflex accent was eliminated entirely in Slovene, with all falling accents being automatically long.\n\nFollowing this, the ''neo-circumflex'' arose, a change shared with Kajkavian. Original short rising (acute and neoacute) syllables were converted to a long falling accent under certain conditions, which re-established the falling accent in initial syllables of multisyllabic words. The neo-circumflex arose when the next syllable contained a non-final weak yer or a long vowel. The following long vowel was shortened, and the previous syllable received compensatory lengthening. It also occurred in the ''volja''-type nouns, where the exact explanation varies (according to the Leiden school, the final ''a'' was long).\n\nAround the 14th century, another change occurred to eliminate length contrasts, this time in rising syllables: all non-final rising accents became long, thus merging with the existing long neoacute.<ref name=\"Greenberg\"/> After this change, accented length distinctions existed only in the final syllable. Final short rising accents (old acute or short) were nondistinctively converted to a falling tone; now all rising accents were automatically long.\n\nFollowing this, the accent retracted from word-final short syllables (old acute or short). This change, again, did not reach all dialects. In Standard Slovene, retraction only occurred if the previous syllable was long or if both syllables were open. It also occurred sometimes in Standard Slovene if the preceding syllable contained a schwa (yer), with both the original and the retracted forms standing side by side. The dialect of [[Babno Polje]] went furthest, retracting ''all'' final accents, even long ones that were produced by the forwards circumflex shift above. The retraction produced a long rising vowel, or in the case of schwa, a short rising schwa. Short ''e'' and ''o'' lengthened to distinctive open-mid vowels {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254\u02d0/}}, contrasting with the close-mid {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} and {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} that were produced by earlier lengthenings.\n\nModern Slovene completely lacks length contrasts in unaccented syllables. In accented syllables, length is only distinguished in final syllables, while medial accented syllables are always long.\n\n===Russian===\n\nRussian lost distinctive pitch and length, having instead a free stress accent. A vestige of the former pitch accent remains in the outcome of the liquid diphthongs ''*el'', ''*er'', ''*ol'' and ''*or'', which undergo so-called ''[[pleophony]]''. When these originally bore an acute or neoacute accent, they surface with the accent on the second vowel (''or\u00f3''), while if they had a circumflex accent, they appear with the accent on the first vowel (''\u00f3ro''). This reflects the original rising and falling intonations of these accents.\n\nRussian preserves accent paradigms ''a'' and ''b'' intact, with stem stress and ending stress respectively (or pre-ending stress when there is no ending). A variant known as ''b<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' has stem stress in the instrumental singular.\n\nMobile paradigms have proliferated, however, with [[Andrey Zaliznyak]] distinguishing mobile patterns ''c'', ''d'', ''d<nowiki>'</nowiki>'', ''e'', ''f'', ''f<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' and ''f<nowiki>''</nowiki>''. Paradigms ''c'' and ''e'' have stem accent in the singular and ending accent in the plural, while this is reversed for paradigm ''d'', and paradigm ''f'' has ending stress throughout. Most of the paradigms have one or more anomalous forms that have stem stress where other forms have ending stress.\n\n==Proto-Slavic length==\nBeside the contrastive tone (rising vs. falling), the Late Proto-Slavic also had a vowel quantity (long vs. short) which was phonemically non-distinctive. Vowels were predictably short and thus neutral with respect to length in pretonic positions further away from the accent (stress) than the first pretonic syllable. In other words, long vowels could occur in:<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Vermeer|1986/2010|pp=3}}</ref>\n# the stressed syllable\n# posttonic syllables\n# the first pretonic syllable\n\n[[Old East Slavic]] and [[Old Polish]] loanwords in Finnish, Karelian, Estonian, Lithuanian and Latvian show that the length of the originally long vowels in Slavic (*a, *\u011b, *i, *u, *\u01eb, *\u0119) is retained regardless of the intonation, the position in the word or the number of syllables.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Stang|1957|pp=52\u201355}}</ref> These loanwords show no trace of the old nasality of *\u0119 and *\u01eb which indicates that the original Proto-Slavic length was preserved in all positions and conditions even after the denasalisation of *\u01eb and *\u0119.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2005|pp=3}}</ref>\n\nAfter surveying the data with respect to stress type (acute, short/circumflex, neoacute), the number of the syllables in a word, the position (stressed, pretonic or posttonic) and the accentual paradigm (a, b or c), {{harvcoltxt|Kapovi\u0107|2005}} offers the following reflexes for West Slavic, and Serbo-Croatian, which have retained distinctive lengths:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!colspan=3 |Common Slavic accented length\n!colspan=2 |Common Slavic pretonic length \n!colspan=2 |Common Slavic posttonic length\n|-\n!\n!Rising\n!Falling\n!New rising\n!In front of less than two moras\n!In front of two moras\n!After short/circumflex (a. p.

They married in 1947. \n\nMeanwhile, in 1944 Palmer had published ''Teach Yourself Music'', part of the extensive English University Press [[Teach Yourself]] series in their distinctive black and yellow jackets, with subjects ranging from salesmanship to jet-engines and rocket propulsion. Attempting such a broad subject in less than 200 pages was obviously a daunting task. The (anonymous) ''Musical Times'' reviewer stated that \"whatever else you may teach yourself, it cannot be done with music\" and expressed \"a good deal of sympathy for a writer who was, as he doubtless well knew, up against it\".<ref>''Musical Times'', 1 September 1944</ref> ''Teach Yourself to Compose Music'', more narrowly focused on harmony, form and counterpoint as well as genres, followed in 1948.<ref name=\"wordpress\">{{cite web|url=https://atuneadayblogdotcom.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/king-palmer-hackney-carriage-c1950/|title=King Palmer: Hackney Carriage (c1945)|website=atuneadayblogdotcom|accessdate=2018-11-01}}</ref> ''Teach Yourself to Play the Piano'' was published in 1957. The books lay out classical best practices clearly and simply, but ignore more modern developments altogether. Reviewing ''Teach Yourself Orchestration'' (1964) [[Geoffrey Bush]] pointed out that \"[[Webern]] might never have existed\".<ref>''Musical Times'', 1 April 1965</ref> His other books included ''The Musical Production \u2013 a complete guide for amateurs'' (with Cossar Turfery, 1953),<ref>Review by Robert Monschein in ''Notes'', Vol. 11, No. 3 (June 1954), pp. 474-475</ref> and ''The ABC of Church Music'' (with Stephen Rhys, 1967).<ref>Review by Charles G Boody in ''The Choral Journal'', Vol. 10, No. 6 (March 1970) p. 27.</ref>\n\n==Conducting and Composition==\nFrom the late 1940s Palmer was building up both his conducting and composition activities. The King Palmer Light Orchestra regularly broadcast on the [[BBC Home Service]] and [[BBC Light Programme|Light Programme]] between 1948 and 1956.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?adv=0&q=%22King+Palmer%22&media=all&yf=1923&yt=2009&mf=1&mt=12&tf=00%3A00&tt=00%3A00#search BBC Genome: ''Radio Times'' archive]</ref> Always a champion of amateur music making, Palmer also conducted the [[City Literary Institute]] Rehearsal Orchestra, formed in November 1949 by professional musicians working in various restaurants and theatres to play through the standard symphonic repertoire.<ref>''Musical Times'', 1 September 1950</ref> Advanced amateurs were also recruited. Palmer also lectured on music at City Lit. His orchestral conducting provided a platform for arrangements such as ''Galopade'', a medley of galops and cancans, but also for original compositions. And an engagement by the [[Ford Motor Company]] for his orchestra to play at the Ford Motor Show in 1946 (held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]) was his first introduction to the potential of commercial music. Palmer composed ''Rhythm of the Road'', with lyrics by Cossar Turfey, which Ford used as the basis for a promotional film, in which the composer can be seen conducting.<ref>Ford Motor Company, ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bulbcPe-F8&list=PL5ZcnseKI5-B2gKqL62gPS1HAZHzjlZ4f Rhythm of the Road]'', 1946]</ref>\n\nFollowing on from this he built up a new career in production and library music, composing over 600 mood music pieces for music library companies such as [[KPM Musichouse|KPM]]. Many of these pieces were short snippets composed to evoke a specific mood for radio, television and films. Many were used multiple times and have become familiar while remaining anonymous, because they are mostly used uncredited. Examples include ''Hackney Carriage'' (memorably used by [[Oliver Stone]] in his 1995 film ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113987/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd IMDB]</ref>), ''Toboggan Ride, Holiday Playtime'' and ''Jogging Along''. Occasionally, a piece would be chosen for a series theme tune and become more widely known, such as the theme for the 1962 US medical drama TV series ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]].''<ref>[https://www1.screenarchives.com/title_detail.cfm/ID/31776/THE-ELEVENTH-HOUR-THE-COMPLETE-FIRST-SEASON-PART-TWO-1962-8-DVDS/ Screenarchives.com]</ref>\n\nAside from library music, Palmer wrote a series of orchestral suites and shorter light music movements, some plays with music and pantomimes for children, and the occasional work with more serious intentions \u2013 notably the ''Three Atonal Studies'' for piano.<ref>''[http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/4th.htm A Fourth Garland of English Light Music Composers]'', by Philip L Scowcroft</ref> He collaborated with his wife Winifred on a new musical, ''The Snow Queen'', in 1967, with music adapted from Grieg. By the end of the 1960s Palmer had stopped composing, but usage of his library music continued to grow. It is still in use today in series such as the [[Nickelodeon]] animated series ''[[The Ren and Stimpy Show]]'' and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', Much of the music has also been repackaged in a set of library music CDs now available to the general music buyer for the first time.<ref>[https://www.emipm.com/en/search?textQuery=King%20Palmer&fields=name,description,albumName,albumDescription,composerName,keywordText,albumCodeCompact,fixationId,versionTypeText EMI Production Music]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nKing Palmer married Winifred Henry in 1947 and they had one son (Roger Lindsay, b 1948) and one daughter (Jane Hetherington, b 1952). For a while the couple set up and managed an arts bookshop in Kensington, where they were living.

They married in 1947. Meanwhile, in 1944 Palmer had published ''Teach Yourself Music'', part of the extensive English University Press [[Teach Yourself]] series in their distinctive black and yellow jackets, with subjects ranging from salesmanship to jet-engines and rocket propulsion. Attempting such a broad subject in less than 200 pages was obviously a daunting task. The (anonymous) ''Musical Times'' reviewer stated that \"whatever else you may teach yourself, it cannot be done with music\" and expressed \"a good deal of sympathy for a writer who was, as he doubtless well knew, up against it\".<ref>''Musical Times'', 1 September 1944</ref> ''Teach Yourself to Compose Music'', more narrowly focused on harmony, form and counterpoint as well as genres, followed in 1948.<ref name=\"wordpress\">{{cite web|url=https://atuneadayblogdotcom.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/king-palmer-hackney-carriage-c1950/|title=King Palmer: Hackney Carriage (c1945)|website=atuneadayblogdotcom|accessdate=2018-11-01}}</ref> ''Teach Yourself to Play the Piano'' was published in 1957.

Palmer also lectured on music at City Lit. His orchestral conducting provided a platform for arrangements such as ''Galopade'', a medley of galops and cancans, but also for original compositions. And an engagement by the [[Ford Motor Company]] for his orchestra to play at the Ford Motor Show in 1946 (held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]) was his first introduction to the potential of commercial music. Palmer composed ''Rhythm of the Road'', with lyrics by Cossar Turfey, which Ford used as the basis for a promotional film, in which the composer can be seen conducting.<ref>Ford Motor Company, ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bulbcPe-F8&list=PL5ZcnseKI5-B2gKqL62gPS1HAZHzjlZ4f Rhythm of the Road]'', 1946]</ref>\n\nFollowing on from this he built up a new career in production and library music, composing over 600 mood music pieces for music library companies such as [[KPM Musichouse|KPM]]. Many of these pieces were short snippets composed to evoke a specific mood for radio, television and films. Many were used multiple times and have become familiar while remaining anonymous, because they are mostly used uncredited. Examples include ''Hackney Carriage'' (memorably used by [[Oliver Stone]] in his 1995 film ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]''<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113987/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd IMDB]</ref>), ''Toboggan Ride, Holiday Playtime'' and ''Jogging Along''. Occasionally, a piece would be chosen for a series theme tune and become more widely known, such as the theme for the 1962 US medical drama TV series ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]].''<ref>[https://www1.screenarchives.com/title_detail.cfm/ID/31776/THE-ELEVENTH-HOUR-THE-COMPLETE-FIRST-SEASON-PART-TWO-1962-8-DVDS/ Screenarchives.com]</ref>\n\nAside from library music, Palmer wrote a series of orchestral suites and shorter light music movements, some plays with music and pantomimes for children, and the occasional work with more serious intentions \u2013 notably the ''Three Atonal Studies'' for piano.<ref>''[http://www.musicweb-international.com/garlands/4th.htm A Fourth Garland of English Light Music Composers]'', by Philip L Scowcroft</ref> He collaborated with his wife Winifred on a new musical, ''The Snow Queen'', in 1967, with music adapted from Grieg. By the end of the 1960s Palmer had stopped composing, but usage of his library music continued to grow. It is still in use today in series such as the [[Nickelodeon]] animated series ''[[The Ren and Stimpy Show]]'' and ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', Much of the music has also been repackaged in a set of library music CDs now available to the general music buyer for the first time.<ref>[https://www.emipm.com/en/search?textQuery=King%20Palmer&fields=name,description,albumName,albumDescription,composerName,keywordText,albumCodeCompact,fixationId,versionTypeText EMI Production Music]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nKing Palmer married Winifred Henry in 1947 and they had one son (Roger Lindsay, b 1948) and one daughter (Jane Hetherington, b 1952). For a while the couple set up and managed an arts bookshop in Kensington, where they were living.

They belong to the [[Hemichordata]], and live in [[secretion|secreted]] tubes on the [[ocean floor]]. Pterobranchia feed by filtering [[plankton]]  out of the water with the help of [[cilia]] attached to [[tentacle]]s. There are about 30 known living [[species]] in the group.\n\nThe class Pterobranchia was established by [[Ray Lankester]] in 1877. It contained, at that time, the single [[genus]] ''[[Rhabdopleura]]''. ''Rhabdopleura'' was at first regarded as an aberrant [[polyzoon]], but when the [[Challenger expedition|''Challenger'' report]] on ''[[Cephalodiscida|Cephalodiscus]]'' was published in 1887, it became clear that ''Cephalodiscus'', the second genus now included in the [[Order (biology)|order]], had affinities in the direction of the [[Enteropneusta]].\n\nStudies under an [[electron microscope]] have suggested that pterobranchs belong to the same [[clade]] as the [[Extinction|extinct]] [[graptolite]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sato|first=A|author2=Rickards RB |author3=Holland PWH |title=The origins of graptolites and other pterobranchs: a journey from 'Polyzoa'|journal=Lethaia|year=2008|volume=41|issue=4|pages=303\u2013316|doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.2008.00123.x}}</ref><ref name=Fortey>{{cite book |author=Fortey, Richard A. |authorlink=Richard Fortey |title=Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth |publisher=Alfred A.

Like their relatives, the [[acorn worm]]s, their body is divided into three parts: an anterior [[proboscis]], a collar, and a trunk. The proboscis is wide and flattened at the tip, and in most species contains glands that secrete a tube of organic material in which the pterobranch spends its adult life. The animals are mostly colonial, with several [[zooid]]s living together in a cluster of tubes. In some species, the individual zooids within the colony are connected by [[stolon]]s.

This entailed the setting of dogs (after placing wagers on each dog) onto a tethered bull. The dog that grabbed the bull by the nose and pinned it to the ground would be the victor. It was common for a bull to maim or kill several dogs at such an event, either by goring, tossing, or trampling. Over the centuries, dogs used for bull-baiting developed the stocky bodies and massive heads and jaws that typify the breed as well as a ferocious and savage temperament. Bull-baiting was made illegal in England by the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Curnutt |first1=Jordan |title=Animals and the Law: A Sourcebook |date=2001 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=284|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=p2p0MptGeBkC}}</ref> This amended the existing legislation to protect animals from mistreatment and included (as \"cattle\") [[snakes]], [[dogs]], [[owls]], and [[donkeys]], so that bull and bear-baiting as well as [[cockfighting]] became prohibited. Therefore, the [[Old English Bulldog]] had outlived its usefulness in England as a sporting animal and its active or \"working\" days were numbered. However, emigrants did have a use for such dogs in the New World. In mid-17th century New York, Bulldogs were used as a part of a citywide roundup effort led by Governor [[Richard Nicolls]]. Because cornering and leading wild bulls were dangerous, Bulldogs were trained to seize a bull by its nose long enough for a rope to be secured around its neck.<ref>Ellis, Edward Robb (2005).

At five to six years of age they start to show signs of aging.\n\nThough today's Bulldog looks tough, he cannot perform the job he was originally created for as he cannot withstand the rigors of running and being thrown by a bull, and also cannot grip with such a short muzzle.  Although not as physically capable as their ancestors, decreased levels of aggression associated with modern bulldogs have resulted in far calmer temperament while remaining physically capable guards and companions.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe oldest single breed specialty club is The Bulldog Club (England), which was formed in 1878. Members of this club met frequently at the Blue Post pub on [[Oxford Street]] in [[London]]. There they wrote the first standard of perfection for the breed. In 1894 the two top Bulldogs, King Orry and Dockleaf, competed in a contest to see which dog could walk {{convert|20|mi|km}}.

Bulldogs must be given plenty of shade and water, and must be kept out of standing heat.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Bulldog\" /> Air conditioning and good ventilation are required to keep them healthy and safe. Bulldogs actually do most of their sweating through the pads on their feet and accordingly enjoy cool floors.

In 2014 the [[Dutch Kennel Club]] implemented some breeding rules to improve the health of the Bulldog. Among these is a fitness test where the dog has to walk 1&nbsp;km (0.62 miles) in 12 minutes.

This entailed the setting of dogs (after placing wagers on each dog) onto a tethered bull. The dog that grabbed the bull by the nose and pinned it to the ground would be the victor. It was common for a bull to maim or kill several dogs at such an event, either by goring, tossing, or trampling. Over the centuries, dogs used for bull-baiting developed the stocky bodies and massive heads and jaws that typify the breed as well as a ferocious and savage temperament. Bull-baiting was made illegal in England by the [[Cruelty to Animals Act 1835]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Curnutt |first1=Jordan |title=Animals and the Law: A Sourcebook |date=2001 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=284|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=p2p0MptGeBkC}}</ref> This amended the existing legislation to protect animals from mistreatment and included (as \"cattle\") [[snakes]], [[dogs]], [[owls]], and [[donkeys]], so that bull and bear-baiting as well as [[cockfighting]] became prohibited. Therefore, the [[Old English Bulldog]] had outlived its usefulness in England as a sporting animal and its active or \"working\" days were numbered. However, emigrants did have a use for such dogs in the New World. In mid-17th century New York, Bulldogs were used as a part of a citywide roundup effort led by Governor [[Richard Nicolls]]. Because cornering and leading wild bulls were dangerous, Bulldogs were trained to seize a bull by its nose long enough for a rope to be secured around its neck.<ref>Ellis, Edward Robb (2005).

Members of this club met frequently at the Blue Post pub on [[Oxford Street]] in [[London]]. There they wrote the first standard of perfection for the breed. In 1894 the two top Bulldogs, King Orry and Dockleaf, competed in a contest to see which dog could walk {{convert|20|mi|km}}.

Bulldogs must be given plenty of shade and water, and must be kept out of standing heat.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Bulldog\" /> Air conditioning and good ventilation are required to keep them healthy and safe.
