Beginning as early as 7000 BCE, the domestication of [[chocolate|cacao]], [[maize]], [[phaseolus|beans]], [[tomato]], [[avocado]], [[vanilla]], [[squash (plant)|squash]] and [[Chili pepper|chili]], as well as the [[Meleagris gallopavo|turkey]] and [[Xoloitzcuintle|dog]], caused a transition from [[Paleo-Indians|paleo-Indian]] hunter-gatherer tribal grouping to the organization of sedentary agricultural villages. In the subsequent Formative period, agriculture and cultural traits such as a complex [[Mesoamerican religion|mythological and religious tradition]], a [[vigesimal]] numeric system, a [[Mesoamerican calendars|complex calendric system]], a [[Mesoamerican ballgame|tradition of ball playing]], and a distinct [[Mesoamerican architecture|architectural style]], were diffused through the area. Also in this period, villages began to become socially stratified and develop into [[chiefdom]]s with the development of large ceremonial centers, interconnected by a network of trade routes for the exchange of luxury goods, such as [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]], [[jade]], [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[cinnabar]], ''[[Spondylus]]'' shells, [[hematite]], and ceramics. While Mesoamerican civilization did know of the [[wheel]] and basic [[metallurgy]], neither of these technologies became culturally important.{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996|p=55}}\n\nAmong the earliest complex civilizations was the [[Olmec]] culture, which inhabited the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico]] and extended inland and southwards across the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. Frequent contact and cultural interchange between the early Olmec and other cultures in Chiapas, Guatemala and Oaxaca laid the basis for the Mesoamerican cultural area. All this was facilitated by considerable [[regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica]], especially along the Pacific coast.\n\nThis formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions, as well as artistic and architectural complexes. In the subsequent [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]], complex urban polities began to develop among the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], with the rise of centers such as [[El Mirador]], [[Calakmul]] and [[Tikal]], and the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] at [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]]. During this period, the first true [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] were developed in the [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] and the Zapotec cultures, and the Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic script]].\n\nMesoamerica is one of only three regions of the world where writing is known to have independently developed (the others being ancient [[Sumer]] and China).<ref name=\"FaganBeck1996\">{{cite book|editor=Brian M.

Upon the collapse of Teotihuac\u00e1n around 600 AD, competition between several important political centers in central Mexico, such as [[Xochicalco]] and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], ensued. At this time during the Epi-Classic period, the [[Nahua people]]s began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of [[Oto-Manguean languages]]. During the early post-Classic period, Central Mexico was dominated by the [[Toltec]] culture, Oaxaca by the [[Mixtec]], and the lowland Maya area had important centers at [[Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1]] and [[Mayap\u00e1n]]. Towards the end of the post-Classic period, the [[Aztec]]s of Central Mexico built a [[tributary states|tributary]] empire covering most of central Mesoamerica.{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996|pp=40\u201380}}\n\nThe distinct Mesoamerican cultural tradition ended with the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]] in the 16th century. Over the next centuries, Mesoamerican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to Spanish colonial rule. Aspects of the Mesoamerican cultural heritage still survive among the indigenous peoples who inhabit Mesoamerica, many of whom continue to speak their ancestral languages, and maintain many practices harking back to their Mesoamerican roots.{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996}}\n\n== Etymology and definition ==\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=2 widths=70 heights=70 mode=nolines caption=\"Ancient Mesoamerican sites in [[El Salvador]]\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Pinturas Rupestres Corinto Morazan 06.JPG|[[Holy Spirit Grotto]]\nFile:Temazcal en Joya de Cer\u00e9n.jpg|[[Joya de Cer\u00e9n]]\nFile:Tazumal 10.jpg|[[Tazumal]]\nFile:Casa Blanca 1.JPG|[[Casa Blanca, El Salvador|Casa Blanca]]\nFile:ES SanAndres 06 2011 Panorama Estructura 1 y 2 La Acropolis 2194.jpg|[[San Andr\u00e9s, El Salvador|San Andres]]\nFile:Piramide Cihuatan.jpg|[[Cihuat\u00e1n]]\n</gallery>\n}}\n\nThe term ''Mesoamerica'' literally means \"middle America\" in Greek. [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]] often refers to a larger area in the Americas, but it has also previously been used more narrowly to refer to Mesoamerica. An example is the title of the 16 volumes of ''The Handbook of Middle American Indians''.  \"Mesoamerica\" is broadly defined as the area that is home to the Mesoamerican civilization, which comprises a group of peoples with close cultural and historical ties. The exact geographic extent of Mesoamerica has varied through time, as the civilization extended North and South from its heartland in southern Mexico. The term was first used by the [[Germany|German]] [[ethnology|ethnologist]] [[Paul Kirchhoff]], who noted that similarities existed among the various [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian cultures]] within the region that included southern [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[El Salvador]], western [[Honduras]], and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] lowlands of [[Nicaragua]] and northwestern [[Costa Rica]]. In the tradition of [[culture-historical archaeology|cultural history]], the prevalent [[archaeological theory]] of the early to middle 20th century, Kirchhoff defined this zone as a cultural area based on a suite of interrelated cultural similarities brought about by millennia of inter- and intra-regional interaction (i.e., [[trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]]).{{sfn|Kirchhoff|1943}}{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996|pp=5\u20138}} Mesoamerica is recognized as a near-prototypical cultural area, and the term is now fully integrated in the standard terminology of pre-Columbian [[cultural anthropology|anthropological]] studies. Conversely, the sister terms [[Aridoamerica]] and [[Oasisamerica]], which refer to northern Mexico and the western [[United States]], respectively, have not entered into widespread usage.\n\nSome of the significant cultural traits defining the Mesoamerican cultural tradition are:\n* [[sedentism]] based on [[maize]] [[agriculture]]\n* the construction of [[mesoamerican pyramids|stepped pyramids]]\n* the use of two different [[mesoamerican calendars|calendars]] (a 260-day ritual calendar and a 365-day calendar based on the [[solar year]])\n* [[vigesimal]] (base 20) number system\n* the use of locally developed [[pictogram|pictographic]] and [[hieroglyph]]ic (logo-syllabic) [[mesoamerican writing systems|writing systems]]\n* the use of [[natural rubber]] and the practice of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]]\n* the use of [[amate|bark paper]] and [[agave]] for ritual purposes and as a medium for writing and the latter also for cooking and clothing\n* the practice of various forms of ritualistic [[sacrifice]], including [[human sacrifice]]\n* a [[mesoamerican religion|religious complex]] based on a combination of [[shamanism]] and natural deities, and a shared system of symbols\n* a [[sprachbund|linguistic area]] defined by a [[mesoamerican language area|number of grammatical traits]] that have spread through the area by diffusion{{sfn|Campbell|Kaufman|Smith-Stark|1986}}\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Mesoamerica}}\n[[File:Flickr - archer10 (Dennis) - Guatemala 1828 - La Danta at the Mayan site of El Mirador.jpg|thumb|[[El Mirador]] flourished from 600 BCE to 100 CE, and may have had a population of over 100,000.]]\n[[File:Puebla farmers.jpg|right|thumb|Landscape of the Mesoamerican highlands]]\nLocated on the [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle American]] [[isthmus]] joining North and [[South America]] between ''ca.'' 10\u00b0 and 22\u00b0 northern [[latitude]], Mesoamerica possesses a complex combination of ecological systems, topographic zones, and environmental contexts. A main distinction groups these different [[ecological niche|niches]] into two broad categories: the lowlands (those areas between [[sea level]] and 1000 meters) and the ''altiplanos'', or highlands (situated between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level).{{sfn|Coe|1994}}{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996|pp=9\u201311}} In the low-lying regions, [[subtropical climate|sub-tropical]] and [[tropical climate]]s are most common, as is true for most of the coastline along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The highlands show much more climatic diversity, ranging from dry tropical to cold [[mountain climate|mountainous climates]]; the dominant climate is [[temperateness|temperate]] with warm temperatures and moderate rainfall. The rainfall varies from the dry [[Oaxaca]] and north [[Yucat\u00e1n]] to the humid southern Pacific and Caribbean lowlands.\n\n=== Cultural sub-areas ===\nSeveral distinct sub-regions within Mesoamerica are defined by a convergence of geographic and cultural attributes. These sub-regions are more conceptual than culturally meaningful, and the demarcation of their limits is not rigid. The Maya area, for example, can be divided into two general groups: the lowlands and highlands. The lowlands are further divided into the southern and northern Maya lowlands. The southern Maya lowlands are generally regarded as encompassing northern [[Guatemala]], southern [[Campeche]] and [[Quintana Roo]] in [[Mexico]], and [[Belize]]. The northern lowlands cover the remainder of the northern portion of the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Other areas include Central Mexico, West Mexico, the Gulf Coast Lowlands, [[Oaxaca]], the Southern Pacific Lowlands, and Southeast Mesoamerica (including northern [[Honduras]]).\n\n=== Topography ===\nThere is extensive topographic variation in Mesoamerica, ranging from the high peaks circumscribing the [[Valley of Mexico]] and within the central [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]] mountains to the low flatlands of the northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The tallest mountain in Mesoamerica is [[Pico de Orizaba]], a [[dormant volcano]] located on the border of [[Puebla]] and [[Veracruz]]. Its peak elevation is 5,636&nbsp;m (18,490&nbsp;ft).\n\nThe Sierra Madre mountains, which consist of several smaller ranges, run from northern Mesoamerica south through [[Costa Rica]]. The chain is historically [[Volcano|volcanic]]. In central and southern Mexico, a portion of the Sierra Madre chain is known as the [[Eje Volc\u00e1nico Transversal]], or the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt. There are 83 inactive and active volcanoes within the Sierra Madre range, including 11 in Mexico, 37 in Guatemala, 23 in El Salvador, 25 in Nicaragua, and 3 in northwestern Costa Rica. According to the Michigan Technological University,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/world.html |title=MTU Volcanoes Page \u2013 World Reference Map |publisher=Geo.mtu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref> 16 of these are still active. The tallest active volcano is [[Popocat\u00e9petl]] at 5,452&nbsp;m (17,887&nbsp;ft). This volcano, which retains its [[Nahuatl]] name, is located 70&nbsp;km (43&nbsp;mi) southeast of [[Mexico City]]. Other volcanoes of note include Tacana on the Mexico\u2013Guatemala border, [[Volc\u00e1n Tajumulco|Tajumulco]] and [[Santamar\u00eda (volcano)|Santamar\u00eda]] in Guatemala, [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]] in El Salvador, [[Momotombo]] in Nicaragua, and [[Arenal Volcano|Arenal]] in Costa Rica.\n\nOne important topographic feature is the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], a low plateau that breaks up the Sierra Madre chain between the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] to the north and the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]] to the south. At its highest point, the [[Isthmus]] is 224&nbsp;m (735&nbsp;ft) above mean sea level. This area also represents the shortest distance between the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] in Mexico. The distance between the two coasts is roughly 200&nbsp;km (120&nbsp;mi). The northern side of the Isthmus is swampy and covered in dense jungle\u2014but the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, as the lowest and most level point within the Sierra Madre mountain chain, was nonetheless a main transportation, communication, and economic route within Mesoamerica.\n\n=== Bodies of water ===\nOutside of the northern Maya lowlands, [[river]]s are common throughout Mesoamerica. Some of the more important ones served as loci of human occupation in the area. The longest river in Mesoamerica is the [[Usumacinta]], which forms in Guatemala at the convergence of the [[Salinas River (Guatemala)|Salinas]] or [[Chixoy River|Chixoy]] and La [[Pasion River]] and runs north for 970&nbsp;km (600&nbsp;mi)\u2014480&nbsp;km (300&nbsp;mi) of which are navigable\u2014eventually draining into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Other rivers of note include the [[Rio Grande de Santiago]], the [[Grijalva River]], the [[Motagua River]], the [[Ul\u00faa River]], and the [[Hondo River (Belize)|Hondo River]]. The northern Maya lowlands, especially the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, are notable for their nearly complete lack of rivers (largely due to the absolute lack of topographic variation). Additionally, no lakes exist in the northern peninsula. The main source of water in this area is [[aquifer]]s that are accessed through natural surface openings called [[cenote]]s.\n\nWith an area of 8,264&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (3,191&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), [[Lake Nicaragua]] is the largest lake in Mesoamerica. [[Lake Chapala]] is Mexico's largest freshwater lake, but [[Lake Texcoco]] is perhaps most well known as the location upon which [[Tenochtitlan]], capital of the [[Aztec]] Empire, was founded. [[Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1]], in northern Guatemala, is notable as where the last independent Maya city, [[Tayasal]] (or Noh Pet\u00e9n), held out against the Spanish until 1697. Other large lakes include [[Lake Atitl\u00e1n]], [[Lake Izabal]], [[Geography of El Salvador|Lake G\u00fcija]], [[Lemoa]], and [[Lake Managua]].\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\nAlmost all [[ecosystem]]s are present in Mesoamerica; the more well known are the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]], the second largest in the world, and [[La Mosquitia]] (consisting of the [[Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve]], [[Tawahka Asangni]], [[Patuca National Park]], and [[Bosawas Biosphere Reserve]]) a [[rainforest]] second in size in the Americas only to the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2006/1718459.htm |title=Science Show \u2013 Bosawas Bioreserve Nicaragua |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2006-08-19 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref> The highlands present [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|mixed]] and [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] forest. The biodiversity is among the richest in the world, though the number of species in the red list of the [[IUCN]] grows every year.\n\n== Chronology and culture ==\n{{Main|Mesoamerican chronology}}\n[[File:Tikal mayan ruins 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Tikal]] is one of the largest archaeological sites, urban centers, and tourist attractions of the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]]. It is located in the archaeological region of the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin]] in what is now northern [[Guatemala]].]]\n\nThe history of human occupation in Mesoamerica is divided into stages or periods. These are known, with slight variation depending on region, as the [[Paleo-Indian]], the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Archaic Era|Archaic]], the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Preclassic]] (or Formative), the [[Classic Period|Classic]], and the [[Postclassic period|Postclassic]]. The last three periods, representing the core of Mesoamerican cultural fluorescence, are further divided into two or three sub-phases. Most of the time following the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century is classified as the Colonial period.\n\nThe differentiation of early periods (i.e., up through the end of the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Late Preclassic]]) generally reflects [[Sociocultural evolution|different configurations of socio-cultural organization]] that are characterized by [[Urgesellschaft|increasing socio-political complexity]], the adoption of new and different [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence strategies]], and changes in economic organization (including increased interregional interaction). The [[Classic Period|Classic]] period through the [[Postclassic period|Postclassic]] are differentiated by the cyclical crystallization and fragmentation of the various political entities throughout Mesoamerica.\n\n=== Paleo-Indian ===\nThe Mesoamerican Paleo-Indian period precedes the advent of agriculture and is characterized by a nomadic [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] subsistence strategy. Big-game hunting, similar to that seen in contemporaneous [[North America]], was a large component of the subsistence strategy of the Mesoamerican Paleo-Indian.  These sites had [[obsidian]] blades and [[Clovis point|Clovis]]-style fluted [[projectile point]]s.\n\n=== Archaic ===\nThe Archaic period (8000\u20132000 BCE) is characterized by the rise of [[Agriculture in Mesoamerica|incipient agriculture]] in Mesoamerica. The initial phases of the Archaic involved the cultivation of wild plants, transitioning into informal domestication and culminating with [[sedentism]] and agricultural production by the close of the period. Transformations of natural environments have been a common feature at least since the mid Holocene.<ref name=\"franco\">{{cite journal|last=Franco-Gaviria|first=Felipe |url= http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/7001/%284%29Franco.pdf |title= The human impact imprint on modern pollen spectra of the Mayan lands |journal= Bolet\u00edn de la Sociedad Geol\u00f3gica Mexicana |date=2018 |volume=70, 1 |pages= 61\u201378 }}</ref> Archaic sites include ''[[Sipacate]]'' in [[Escuintla]], Guatemala, where maize [[pollen analysis|pollen samples]] date to c. 3500 BCE.<ref name=\"roush\">{{cite journal|last=Roush|first=Wade|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/276/5314/894.summary|title=Archaeobiology: Squash Seeds Yield New View of Early American Farming|journal=Science|date=9 May 1997|volume=276|issue=5314|pages=894\u201395 |doi=10.1126/science.276.5314.894}}</ref>\n\n=== Preclassic/Formative ===\n{{See also|Olmec influences on Mesoamerican cultures}}\n[[File:San Lorenzo Monument 3.jpg|thumb|[[Olmec colossal heads|Olmec Colossal Head]] No. 3 1200\u2013900 BCE]]\n\nThe first complex civilization to develop in Mesoamerica was that of the [[Olmec]], who inhabited the gulf coast region of [[Veracruz]] throughout the Preclassic period. The main sites of the Olmec include [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n]], [[La Venta]], and [[Tres Zapotes]]. Specific dates vary, but these sites were occupied from roughly 1200 to 400 BCE.

Malmstr\u00f6m}}&nbsp;{{small|(10.1&nbsp;KB)}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Middle and Late Preclassic period, the [[Maya civilization]] developed in the southern Maya highlands and lowlands, and at a few sites in the northern Maya lowlands. The earliest Maya sites coalesced after 1000 BCE, and include [[Nakbe]], [[El Mirador]], and [[Cerros]]. Middle to Late [[Preclassic Maya]] sites include [[Kaminaljuy\u00fa]], [[Cival]], [[Edzn\u00e1]], [[Cob\u00e1]], [[Lamanai]], [[Komchen]], [[Dzibilchaltun]], and [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], among others.\n\nThe Preclassic in the central Mexican highlands is represented by such sites as [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya]], [[Tlatilco]], and [[Cuicuilco]]. These sites were eventually superseded by [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]], an important Classic-era site that eventually dominated economic and interaction spheres throughout Mesoamerica. The settlement of Teotihuacan is dated to the later portion of the Late Preclassic, or roughly 50 CE.\n\nIn the [[Valley of Oaxaca]], [[San Jos\u00e9 Mogote]] represents one of the oldest permanent agricultural villages in the area, and one of the first to use pottery. During the Early and Middle Preclassic, the site developed some of the earliest examples of defensive [[palisade]]s, ceremonial structures, the use of [[adobe]], and [[Zapotec writing|hieroglyphic writing]]. Also of importance, the site was one of the first to demonstrate [[ascribed status|inherited status]], signifying a radical shift in socio-cultural and political structure. San Jos\u00e9 Mogote was eventual overtaken by [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]], the subsequent capital of the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec empire]], during the Late Preclassic.\n\nThe Preclassic in western Mexico, in the states of [[Nayarit]], [[Jalisco]], [[Colima]], and [[Michoac\u00e1n]] also known as the Occidente, is poorly understood. This period is best represented by the thousands of figurines recovered by looters and ascribed to the \"[[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition|shaft tomb tradition]]\".\n\n====Preclassic gallery====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Acr\u00f3bata de Tlatilco.JPG|Sculpture of \"The Acrobat\" from [[Tlatilco]].\nFile:Pir\u00e1mide de Cuicuilco al Sur del Distrito Federal.jpg|[[Cuicuilco]] 800\u2013600 BCE\nFile:Nakbe str.JPG|[[Nakb\u00e9]], Mid Preclassic (600 BCE) Palace remains, The Mirador Basin\nFile:San Jose Mogote Pyramid.jpg|The partly excavated main structure of [[San Jose Mogote]] 1500\u2013500 BCE\nFile:Montealban el observatorio.JPG|[[Monte Alban]], Building J in the foreground. 200 BCE \u2013 200 CE\n</gallery>\n\n=== Classic ===\n\n==== Early Classic ====\n[[File:Piramide de la Luna 072006.jpg|thumb|[[Pyramid of the Moon]] viewed from atop of the [[Pyramid of the Sun]].]]\nThe Classic period is marked by the rise and dominance of several polities. The traditional distinction between the Early and Late Classic are marked by their changing fortune and their ability to maintain regional primacy. Of paramount importance are Teotihuac\u00e1n in central Mexico and [[Tikal]] in Guatemala; the Early Classic's temporal limits generally correlate to the main periods of these sites. Monte Alban in Oaxaca is another Classic-period polity that expanded and flourished during this period, but the Zapotec capital exerted less interregional influence than the other two sites.\n\nDuring the Early Classic, Teotihuacan participated in and perhaps dominated a far-reaching macro-regional interaction network. Architectural and artifact styles (talud-tablero, tripod slab-footed ceramic vessels) epitomized at Teotihuacan were mimicked and adopted at many distant settlements. [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|Pachuca]] obsidian, whose trade and distribution is argued to have been economically controlled by Teotihuacan, is found throughout Mesoamerica.\n\nTikal came to dominate much of the southern Maya lowlands politically, economically, and militarily during the Early Classic. An exchange network centered at Tikal distributed a variety of goods and commodities throughout southeast Mesoamerica, such as obsidian imported from central Mexico (e.g., Pachuca) and highland Guatemala (e.g., [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|El Chayal]], which was predominantly used by the Maya during the Early Classic), and [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] from the [[Motagua River|Motagua valley]] in Guatemala. Tikal was often in conflict with other polities in the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin]], as well as with others outside of it, including [[Uaxactun]], [[Caracol, Belize|Caracol]], [[Dos Pilas]], [[Naranjo]], and [[Calakmul]]. Towards the end of the Early Classic, this conflict lead to Tikal's military defeat at the hands of Caracol in 562, and a period commonly known as the [[Tikal#Tikal hiatus|Tikal Hiatus]].\n\n=====Early Classic gallery =====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Teotihuac\u00e1n - Chalchiuhtlicue.jpg|[[Great Goddess of Teotihuacan]] 200\u2013500 CE\nFile:Teuchitlan scale model 1.jpg|A reconstruction of [[Guachimontones]], flourished from 200\u2013400 CE\nFile:Dzibanche, Building 1, Temple of the Owl (14364450242).jpg|Temple of the Owl, Dzibanche 200\u2013600 CE\nFile:Acanceh1.jpg|Acanceh, 200\u2013300 CE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/features/acanceh/history.html|title=Mesoweb Articles|work=mesoweb.com}}</ref>\nFile:Kohunlich Mask cropped.jpg|Mask located on the \"Temple of the Masks\" [[Kohunlich]] c. 500 CE\n</gallery>\n\n==== Late Classic ====\n[[File:Xochicalco Serpiente Emplumada GR.jpg|thumb|[[Xochicalco]], Temple of the Feathered Serpent, 650\u2013900 CE]]\nThe Late Classic period (beginning c. 600 CE until 909 CE) is characterized as a period of interregional competition and factionalization among the numerous regional polities in the Maya area. This largely resulted from the decrease in Tikal's socio-political and economic power at the beginning of the period. It was therefore during this time that other sites rose to regional prominence and were able to exert greater interregional influence, including Caracol, [[Cop\u00e1n]], [[Palenque]], and Calakmul (which was allied with Caracol and may have assisted in the defeat of Tikal), and [[Dos Pilas]] [[Aguateca]] and [[Cancu\u00e9n]] in the [[Petexbat\u00fan]] region of Guatemala. Around 710, Tikal arose again and started to build strong alliances and defeat its worst enemies. In the Maya area, the Late Classic ended with the so-called \"[[Maya collapse]]\", a transitional period coupling the general depopulation of the southern lowlands and development and florescence of centers in the northern lowlands.\n\n=====Late Classic gallery=====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:PalacefromTempleCrossPalenque.JPG|Main palace of Palenque, 7th century CE\nFile:Palenque - Maske des Pakal.jpg|[[K'inich Janaab Pakal I]] of [[Palenque]] 603\u2013683 CE\nFile:Copan St H.jpg|Copan Stela H commissioned by [[Uaxaclajuun Ub\u02bcaah K\u02bcawiil]] 695\u2013738 CE\nFile:Jaina Figurine 1 (T Aleto).jpg|[[Jaina Island]] type figure (Maya) 650\u2013800 CE\nFile:VestidosDeSacerdotes(Hombre-Ave).jpg|[[Cacaxtla]], Mural depicting the Bird Man 650\u2013900 CE\n\n</gallery>\n\n==== Terminal Classic ====\n[[File:0077 Uxmal.JPG|thumb|Detail of the Nunnery Quadrangle at [[Uxmal]], 10th century]]\nGenerally applied to the Maya area, the Terminal Classic roughly spans the time between C. 800/850 and c. 1000 CE. Overall, it generally correlates with the rise to prominence of [[Puuc]] settlements in the northern Maya lowlands, so named after the hills where they are mainly found. Puuc settlements are specifically associated with a unique architectural style (the \"Puuc architectural style\") that represents a technological departure from previous construction techniques. Major Puuc sites include [[Uxmal]], [[Sayil]], [[Labna]], [[Kabah (Maya site)|Kabah]], and [[Oxkintok]]. While generally concentrated within the area in and around the Puuc hills, the style has been documented as far away as at [[Chichen Itza]] to the east and [[Edzna]] to the south.\n\nChich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 was originally thought to have been a Postclassic site in the northern Maya lowlands. Research over the past few decades has established that it was first settled during the Early/Late Classic transition but rose to prominence during the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic. During its apogee, this widely known site economically and politically dominated the northern lowlands. Its participation in the circum-peninsular exchange route, possible through its port site of [[Isla Cerritos]], allowed Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 to remain highly connected to areas such as central Mexico and [[Central America]]. The apparent \"Mexicanization\" of architecture at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 led past researchers to believe that Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 existed under the control of a Toltec empire. Chronological data refutes this early interpretation, and it is now known that Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 predated the Toltec; Mexican architectural styles are now used as an indicator of strong economic and ideological ties between the two regions.\n\n=====Terminal Classic gallery=====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Great Ball Court Chichen Itza 03 2011 1423.jpg|Chichen Itza, Temple of the Jaguars 900\u20131000 CE\nFile:Uxmal - Palacio 16.jpg|Governor's Palace rear view and details,  10th century CE, [[Uxmal]]\nFile:Temple of the Masks, Kabah (8264867094).jpg|Codz Poop,  7th\u201310th centuries CE [[Kabah (Maya site)|Kabah]]\nFile:Sayil Ruta Puuc 1.JPG|[[Sayil]], three-story palace, 600\u2013900 CE\nFile:Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 - 29.jpg|Chichen Itza, \"Temple of Three Dintels\" 600\u20131000 CE\n</gallery>\n\n=== Postclassic ===\nThe Postclassic (beginning 900\u20131000 CE, depending on area) is, like the Late Classic, characterized by the cyclical crystallization and fragmentation of various polities. The main Maya centers were located in the northern lowlands. Following Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, whose political structure collapsed during the Early Postclassic, [[Mayap\u00e1n]] rose to prominence during the Middle Postclassic and dominated the north for c. 200 years. After Mayap\u00e1n's fragmentation, political structure in the northern lowlands revolved around large towns or city-states, such as [[Oxkutzcab]] and [[Ti\u2019ho]] ([[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n]]), that competed with one another.\n\n[[File:Mesoam\u00e9rica y Centroamerica prehispanica siglo XVI.svg|thumb|Mesoamerica and Central America in the 16th century before Spanish arrival]]\n\n[[Tonin\u00e1]], in the Chiapas highlands, and [[Kaminaljuy\u00fa]] in the central Guatemala highlands, were important southern highland Maya centers. The latter site, Kaminaljuy\u00fa, is one of the longest occupied sites in Mesoamerica and was continuously inhabited from c. 800 BCE to around 1200 CE. Other important highland Maya groups include the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] of [[Utatl\u00e1n]], the [[Mam people|Mam]] in [[Zaculeu]], the [[Poqomam language|Poqomam]] in [[Mixco Viejo]], and the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] at [[Iximche]] in the Guatemalan highlands. The [[Pipil people|Pipil]] resided in [[El Salvador]], while the [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']] were in eastern Guatemala and northwestern [[Honduras]].\n\nIn central Mexico, the early portion of the Postclassic correlates with the rise of the [[Toltec]] and an empire based at their capital, [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]] (also known as [[Tollan]]). [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], initially an important Early Classic center contemporaneous with Teotihuacan, maintained its political structure (it did not collapse) and continued to function as a regionally important center during the Postclassic. The latter portion of the Postclassic is generally associated with the rise of the [[Mexica]] and the [[Aztec Empire]]. One of the more commonly known cultural groups in Mesoamerica, the Aztec politically dominated nearly all of central Mexico, the Gulf Coast, Mexico's southern Pacific Coast (Chiapas and into Guatemala), Oaxaca, and [[Guerrero]].\n\nThe [[Tarascan state|Tarascans]] (also known as the [[Pur\u00e9pecha people|P'urh\u00e9pecha]]) were located in [[Michoac\u00e1n]] and Guerrero. With their capital at [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]], the Tarascan state was one of the few to actively and continuously resist Aztec domination during the Late Postclassic. Other important Postclassic cultures in Mesoamerica include the [[Totonac]] along the eastern coast (in the modern-day states of [[Veracruz]], [[Puebla]], and [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]]). The [[Huastec people|Huastec]] resided north of the Totonac, mainly in the modern-day states of [[Tamaulipas]] and northern Veracruz. The [[Mixtec]] and Zapotec cultures, centered at [[Mitla]] and [[Zaachila]] respectively, inhabited Oaxaca.\n\nThe Postclassic ends with the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|arrival of the Spanish]] and their subsequent conquest of the Aztec between 1519 and 1521. Many other cultural groups did not acquiesce until later. For example, Maya groups in the Pet\u00e9n area, including the [[Itza]] at [[Tayasal]] and the [[Kowoj]] at [[Zacpeten]], remained independent until 1697.\n\nSome Mesoamerican cultures never achieved dominant status or left impressive archaeological remains but are nevertheless noteworthy. These include the [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Mixe\u2013Zoquean languages|Mixe\u2013Zoque]] groups (which may or may not have been related to the Olmecs), the northern [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] groups, often referred to as the [[Chichimeca]], that include the [[Cora people|Cora]] and [[Huichol people|Huichol]], the Chontales, the Huaves, and the Pipil, Xincan and Lencan peoples of Central America.\n\n====Postclassic gallery====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Zona Arqueol\u00f3gica Mitla 10.JPG|Palace of [[Mitla]], Oaxaca 12th century\nFile:TlatelolcoSite01.JPG|The Calendar temple of [[Tlatelolco (archaeological site)|Tlatelolco]], 1200 CE\nFile:Codex Zouche-Nuttall, page 20.jpg|Detail of page 20 from the [[Codex Zouche-Nuttall]], 14\u201315th century\nFile:Escudo De Yanhuitl\u00e1n.jpg|Pectoral mixtec, Shield of Yanhuitlan.\nFile:Musee National Anthropologie-Calendrier Maya.jpg|[[Aztec sun stone]], early 16th century\n</gallery>\n\n===Chronology in chart form===\n{{Main|Mesoamerican chronology}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:175px;\"|Period\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Timespan\n! style=\"width:675px;\"|Important cultures, cities\n|- style=\"background:silver\"\n|+'''Summary of the chronology and cultures of Mesoamerica'''\n|[[History of Mesoamerica (Paleo-Indian)|Paleo-Indian]]\n|10,000\u20133500 BCE\n|Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, obsidian and pyrite points, Iztapan\n|-=\"background:silver\"\n|[[Mesoamerican chronology#Archaic Era|Archaic]]\n|3500\u20131800 BCE\n|Agricultural settlements, [[Tehuac\u00e1n, Puebla|Tehuac\u00e1n]]\n|- style=\"background:silver\"\n|[[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Preclassic (Formative)]]\n|2000 BCE \u2013 250 CE\n|Unknown culture in [[La Blanca]] and [[Ujuxte]], [[Monte Alto culture]]\n|-\n|Early Preclassic\n|2000\u20131000 BCE\n|Olmec area: [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan]]; Central Mexico: [[Chalcatzingo]]; Valley of Oaxaca: [[San Jos\u00e9 Mogote]].

The earliest example of [[maize]] dates to c. 4000 BCE and comes from [[Guil\u00e1 Naquitz]], a cave in Oaxaca. Earlier maize samples have been documented at the Los Ladrones cave site in [[Panama]], c. 5500 BCE.<ref>{{cite web|title=Los Ladrones cave site|url=http://www.uacam.mx/.../ee8480fb39dbff8e86256ad3004e1394/$FILE/ATT4M6OX/Campeche%202002%20paper.pdf|publisher=UAC|access-date=2007-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215205412/http://www.uacam.mx/.../ee8480fb39dbff8e86256ad3004e1394/$FILE/ATT4M6OX/Campeche%202002%20paper.pdf|archive-date=2012-02-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> Slightly thereafter, semi-[[agrarian community|agrarian communities]] began to cultivate other crops throughout Mesoamerica.<ref>O'Brien (2005), p. 25.</ref> Maize was the most common domesticate, but the common bean, tepary bean, scarlet runner bean, [[jicama]], [[tomato]] and squash all became common cultivates by 3500 BCE. At the same time, these communities exploited [[cotton]], [[yucca]], and [[agave]] for fibers and [[textile]] materials.<ref>Diamond (1999), pp. 126\u201327.</ref> By 2000 BCE, corn was the staple crop in the region, and remained so through modern times. The Ram\u00f3n or [[Brosimum alicastrum|Breadnut tree]] (''[[Brosimum alicastrum]]'') was an occasional substitute for maize in producing flour. Fruit was also important in the daily diet of Mesoamerican cultures. Some of the main ones consumed include [[avocado]], [[papaya]], [[guava]], [[mamey (disambiguation)|mamey]], [[Sapote|zapote]], and [[annona]].\n\nMesoamerica lacked animals suitable for domestication, most notably domesticated large [[ungulate]]s. The lack of [[draft animals]] for transportation is one notable difference between Mesoamerica and the cultures of the South American Andes. Other animals, including the [[duck]], [[dog]]s, and [[wild turkey|turkey]], were [[domestication|domesticated]]. Turkey was the first, occurring around 3500 BCE.<ref>Diamond (1999) p. 100.</ref> [[Dog meat|Dogs]] were the primary source of animal protein in ancient Mesoamerica,<ref>Coe (1994), p. 45 (\"The only domestic animals were dogs\u2014the principal source of meat for much of Preclassic Mesoamerica\u2014and turkeys\u2014understandably rare because that familiar bird consumes very large quantities of corn and is thus expensive to raise\".)</ref> and dog bones are common in midden deposits throughout the region.\n\nSocieties of this region did hunt certain wild species for food. These animals included deer, [[rabbit]], birds, and various types of insects. They also hunted for luxury items, such as feline fur and bird plumage.<ref>Diamond (1999).</ref>\n\nMesoamerican cultures that lived in the lowlands and coastal plains settled down in agrarian communities somewhat later than did highland cultures due to the fact that there was a greater abundance of fruits and animals in these areas, which made a hunter-gatherer lifestyle more attractive.<ref>O'Brien (2005), p. 25</ref> Fishing also was a major provider of food to lowland and coastal Mesoamericans creating a further disincentive to settle down in permanent communities.\n\n=== Political organization ===\n[[File:ChanBahlumCatherwood.jpg|thumb|upright|[[K'inich Kan B'alam II]], the Classic period ruler of [[Palenque]], as depicted on a [[stele]]]]\n\nCeremonial centers were the nuclei of Mesoamerican settlements. The temples provided spatial orientation, which was imparted to the surrounding town. The cities with their commercial and religious centers were always political entities, somewhat similar to the European [[city-state]], and each person could identify with the city where they lived.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nCeremonial centers were always built to be visible. Pyramids were meant to stand out from the rest of the city, to represent the gods and their powers. Another characteristic feature of the ceremonial centers is historic layers. All the ceremonial edifices were built in various phases, one on top of the other, to the point that what we now see is usually the last stage of construction. Ultimately, the ceremonial centers were the architectural translation of the identity of each city, as represented by the veneration of their gods and masters.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} [[Stela]]e were common public monuments throughout Mesoamerica, and served to commemorate notable successes, events and dates associated with the rulers and nobility of the various sites.\n\n=== Economy ===\n{{See also|Trade in Maya civilization}}\n\nGiven that Mesoamerica was broken into numerous and diverse ecological niches, none of the societies that inhabited the area were self-sufficient.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} For this reason, from the last centuries of the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] period (8000 BC\u2013 1000 BC) onward, regions compensated for the environmental inadequacies by specializing in the extraction of certain abundant natural resources and then trading them for necessary unavailable resources through established commercial trade networks.\n\nThe following is a list of some of the specialized resources traded from the various Mesoamerican sub-regions and environmental contexts:\n* Pacific lowlands: [[cotton]] and [[cochineal]]\n* Maya lowlands and the Gulf Coast: [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[vanilla]], [[jaguar]] skins, birds and bird feathers (especially [[quetzal]] and [[macaw]])\n* Central Mexico: Obsidian ([[Pachuca]])\n* Guatemalan highlands: Obsidian ([[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|San Martin Jilotepeque]], [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|El Chayal]], and [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|Ixtepeque]]), [[pyrite]], and [[jade]] from the [[Motagua River]] valley\n* Coastal areas: [[salt]], dry [[fish]], [[Animal shell|shell]], and [[dye]]s\n\n== Common characteristics of Mesoamerican culture ==\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Mesoamerican architecture}}\n{{Empty section|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== Calendrical systems ===\n{{main|Mesoamerican calendars}}\n[[File:Maya days.jpg|thumb|\"Head Variant\" or \"Patron Gods\" glyphs for Maya days]]\n[[File:Tikalemblem.jpg|thumb|The [[Maya script|emblem glyph]] of Tikal (Mutal)]]\n\nAgriculturally based people historically divide the year into four seasons. These included the two [[solstices]] and the two [[equinoxes]], which could be thought of as the four \"directional pillars\" that support the year. These four times of the year were, and still are, important as they indicate seasonal changes that directly impact the lives of Mesoamerican agriculturalists.\n\nThe Maya closely observed and duly recorded the seasonal markers. They prepared almanacs recording past and recent solar and [[lunar eclipses]], the phases of the [[moon]], the periods of [[Venus]] and [[Mars]], the movements of various other planets, and conjunctions of celestial bodies. These almanacs also made future predictions concerning celestial events. These tables are remarkably accurate, given the technology available, and indicate a significant level of knowledge among Maya [[astronomer]]s.<ref>Roxanne V. Pacheco, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030718193206/http://www.unm.edu/~abqteach/ArcheoCUs/99-01-08.pdf Myths of Mesoamerican Cultures Reflect a Knowledge and Practice of Astronomy], University of New Mexico, ''archived'' July 18, 2003 (accessed January 25, 2016).</ref>\n\nAmong the many types of calendars the Maya maintained, the most important include a 260-day cycle, a 360-day cycle or 'year', a 365-day cycle or year, a lunar cycle, and a Venus cycle, which tracked the [[synodic]] period of Venus. Maya of the European contact period said that knowing the past aided in both understanding the present and predicting the future (Diego de Landa). The 260-day cycle was a calendar to govern agriculture, observe religious holidays, mark the movements of celestial bodies and memorialize public officials. The 260-day cycle was also used for divination, and (like the Catholic calendar of saints) to name newborns.<ref>Bernardino de Sahagun, Historia de las cosas de Nueva Espana; Diego Duran, The Book of The Gods and Rites, Oklahoma; The Books of [[Chilam Balam]] of Mani, Kaua, and Chumayel.</ref>\n\nThe names given to the days, months, and years in the Mesoamerican calendar came, for the most part, from animals, flowers, heavenly bodies, and cultural concepts that held symbolic significance in Mesoamerican culture. This calendar was used throughout the history of Mesoamerican by nearly every culture. Even today, several Maya groups in Guatemala, including the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']], [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']], [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]], and the [[Mixe]] people of Oaxaca continue using modernized forms of the Mesoamerican calendar.\n\n=== Writing systems ===\n{{Main|Mesoamerican writing systems}}\n[[File:La Mojarra Estela 1 (Escritura superior).jpg|thumb|One of the earliest examples of the [[Mesoamerican writing systems]], the [[Epi-Olmec script]] on the [[La Mojarra Stela 1]] dated to around 150 CE. Mesoamerica is one of the five places in the world where [[writing]] has developed independently.]]\nThe Mesoamerican scripts deciphered to date are [[logosyllabary|logosyllabic]] combining the use of [[logograms]] with a [[syllabary]], and they are often called [[hieroglyph]]ic scripts. Five or six different scripts have been documented in Mesoamerica, but archaeological dating methods, and a certain degree of self-interest, create difficulties in establishing priority and thus the forebear from which the others developed. The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and therefore the most widely known, is the classic [[Maya script]]. Others include the [[Olmec hieroglyphs|Olmec]], Zapotec, and [[Epi-Olmec script|Epi-Olmec/Isthmian]] writing systems. An extensive [[Mesoamerican literature]] has been conserved partly in indigenous scripts and partly in the postinvasion transcriptions into [[Latin script]].\n\nThe other [[glyph (archaeology)|glyphic]] writing systems of Mesoamerica, and their interpretation, have been subject to much debate. One important ongoing discussion regards whether non-Maya Mesoamerican texts can be considered examples of true writing or whether non-Maya Mesoamerican texts are best understood as [[pictographic]] conventions that express ideas, specifically religious ones, but don't represent the phonetics of spoken language.\n\nMesoamerican writing is found in several mediums, including large stone monuments such as [[stelae]], carved directly onto architecture, carved or painted over stucco (e.g., [[murals]]), and on [[pottery]]. No Precolumbian Mesoamerican society is known to have had widespread literacy, and literacy was probably restricted to particular social classes, including scribes, painters, merchants, and the nobility.\n\nThe Mesoamerican book was typically written with brush and colored inks on a paper prepared from the inner bark of the ficus amacus. The book consisted of a long strip of the prepared bark, which was folded like a screenfold to define individual pages. The pages were often covered and protected by elaborately carved book boards. Some books were composed of square pages while others were composed of rectangular pages.\n\nFollowing the Spanish conquests in the sixteenth century, Spanish friars taught indigenous scribes to write their languages in alphabetic texts. Many oral histories of the prehispanic period were subsequently recorded in alphabetic texts.  The indigenous in central and southern Mexico continued to produce written texts in the colonial period, many with pictorial elements.  An important scholarly reference work is the ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]], Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources''. [[Mesoamerican codices]] survive from the [[Aztec codices|Aztec]], [[Maya codices|Maya]], [[Mixtec codices|Mixtec]], and [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] regions.\n\n=== Arithmetic ===\n{{See also|Maya numerals}}\n\nMesoamerican [[arithmetic]] treated [[number]]s as having both literal and symbolic value, the result of the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] nature that characterized Mesoamerican ideology.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} As mentioned, the Mesoamerican numbering system was vigesimal (i.e., based on the number 20).\n\nIn representing numbers, a series of bars and dots were employed. Dots had a value of one, and bars had a value of five. This type of arithmetic was combined with a symbolic numerology: '2' was related to origins, as all origins can be thought of as doubling; '3' was related to household fire; '4' was linked to the four corners of the universe; '5' expressed instability; '9' pertained to the underworld and the night; '13' was the number for light, '20' for abundance, and '400' for infinity. The [[0 (number)|concept of zero]] was also used, and its representation at the Late Preclassic occupation of [[Tres Zapotes]] is one of the earliest uses of zero in human history.\n\n=== Food, medicine, and science ===\n{{cquote|Mesoamerica would deserve its place in the human [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] if its inhabitants had only created [[maize]], in terms of harvest weight the world's most important crop.

One writer estimated that Indians developed three-fifths of the crops now grown in cultivation, most of them in Mesoamerica. Having secured their food supply, the Mesoamerican societies turned to intellectual pursuits. In a millennium or less, a comparatively short time, they invented their own [[writing]], [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]], including the [[zero]].<ref>Mann, Charles C. 1491: Revelations of the Americas before Columbus.

In this form, it helps the dead cross the Chicnahuapan, a river that separates the world of the living from the dead.]]\n[[File:Mascara Dios Murcielago.jpg|thumb|Zapotec mask of the Bat God.]]\nThe great breadth of the Mesoamerican [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] of [[deities]] is due to the incorporation of ideological and religious elements from the first primitive religion of Fire, Earth, Water and Nature. Astral divinities (the sun, stars, constellations, and Venus) were adopted and represented in anthropomorphic, [[zoomorphic]], and anthropozoomorphic sculptures, and in day-to-day objects.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} The qualities of these gods and their attributes changed with the passage of time and with cultural influences from other Mesoamerican groups. The gods are at once three: creator, preserver, and destroyer, and at the same time just one. An important characteristic of Mesoamerican religion was the dualism among the divine entities. The gods represented the confrontation between opposite poles: the positive, exemplified by light, the masculine, force, war, the sun, etc.; and the negative, exemplified by darkness, the feminine, repose, peace, the moon, etc.\n\nThe typical Mesoamerican cosmology sees the world as separated into a day world watched by the sun and a night world watched by the moon. More importantly, the three superposed levels of the world are united by a [[Ceiba]] tree (''Yaxche''' in Mayan). The geographic vision is also tied to the cardinal points. Certain geographical features are linked to different parts of this cosmovision. Thus mountains and tall trees connect the middle and upper worlds; caves connect the middle and nether worlds.\n\n==== Sacrifice ====\nGenerally, sacrifice can be divided into two types: [[Bloodletting rituals in Maya culture|autosacrifice]] and [[human sacrifice]]. The different forms of sacrifice are reflected in the imagery used to evoke ideological structure and sociocultural organization in Mesoamerica. In the Maya area, for example, stele depict bloodletting rituals performed by ruling elites, eagles and jaguars devouring human hearts, jade circles or necklaces that represented hearts, and plants and flowers that symbolized both nature and the blood that provided life.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Imagery also showed pleas for rain or pleas for blood, with the same intention to replenish the divine energy. Ritual sacrifice was done in efforts to appease the gods, and was done with the purpose of protection of the population.\n\n===== Autosacrifice =====\n{{Main|Bloodletting in Mesoamerica}}\n{{See also|Sacrifice in Maya culture}}[[File:Human sacrifice (Codex Laud, f.8).png|thumb|Ritual human sacrifice portrayed in [[Codex Laud]]]]\n\nAutosacrifice, also called [[bloodletting]], is the ritualized practice of drawing blood from oneself. It is commonly seen or represented through iconography as performed by ruling elites in highly ritualized ceremonies, but it was easily practiced in mundane sociocultural contexts (i.e., non-elites could perform autosacrifice). The act was typically performed with [[obsidian]] [[prismatic blade]]s or [[Stingray injury#Biological structure of the barb|stingray spines]], and blood was drawn from piercing or cutting the [[tongue]], [[earlobe]]s, and/or [[genitals]] (among other locations). Another form of autosacrifice was conducted by pulling a rope with attached thorns through the tongue or earlobes. The blood produced was then collected on [[amate]] held in a bowl.\n\nAutosacrifice was not limited to male rulers, as their female counterparts often performed these ritualized activities. They are typically shown performing the rope and thorns technique. A recently discovered queen's tomb in the Classic Maya site of [[El Per\u00fa (Maya site)|Waka]] (also known as El Per\u00fa) had a ceremonial stingray spine placed in her genital area, suggesting that women also performed bloodletting in their genitalia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/05/040506073833.htm|title=Archaeologists Announce Discoveries At The Ancient Maya Site Of Waka' In Northern Guatemala|date=May 6, 2004|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n===== Human sacrifice =====\n{{See also|Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|Human sacrifice in Maya culture}}\n\nSacrifice had great importance in the social and religious aspects of Mesoamerican culture. First, it showed death transformed into the divine.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Death is the consequence of a human sacrifice, but it is not the end; it is but the continuation of the cosmic cycle. Death creates life\u2014divine energy is liberated through death and returns to the gods, who are then able to create more life. Secondly, it justifies war, since the most valuable sacrifices are obtained through conflict. The death of the warrior is the greatest sacrifice and gives the gods the energy to go about their daily activities, such as the bringing of rain. Warfare and capturing prisoners became a method of social advancement and a religious cause. Finally, it justifies the control of power by the two ruling classes, the priests and the warriors. The priests controlled the religious ideology, and the warriors supplied the sacrifices. Historically it was also in discussion that those sacrificed were chosen by the gods, this idea of being \"chosen\" was decided by the gods. This was then displayed by acts, such as being struck by lightning. If someone was struck by lightning and a sacrifice was needed they would often be chosen by their population, as they believed they were chosen by the gods.\n\n==== Ballgame ====\n{{Main|Mesoamerican ballgame}}\n[[File:Uaxactunballcourt.jpg|thumb|A small ceremonial ballcourt at [[Uaxactun]].]]\n[[File:Ballgamemarker.jpg|thumb|[[Mesoamerican ballgame|Ballgame marker]] from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|classic]] [[Maya civilization|Lowland Maya]] site of [[Chinkultic]], [[Mexico]] depicting a ballplayer in full gear]]\n\nThe Mesoamerican ballgame was a sport with ritual associations played for over 3000 years by nearly all pre-Columbian peoples of Mesoamerica. The sport had different versions in different places during the millennia, and a modern version of the game, [[ulama (game)|ulama]], is still played in a few places.\n\nOver 1300 [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] have been found throughout Mesoamerica.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Taladoire|2001|p=98}} Note that slightly over 200 ballcourts have also been identified in the [[American Southwest]]. This total does not include those, since they are outside Mesoamerica, and there is discussion whether these areas were actually used for ballplaying.</ref> They vary considerably in size, but they all feature long narrow alleys with side-walls to bounce the balls against.\n\nThe rules of the ballgame are not known, but it was probably similar to volleyball, where the object is to keep the ball in play. In the most well-known version of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, though some versions used forearms or employed rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of solid rubber, and weighed up to 4&nbsp;kg or more, with sizes that differed greatly over time or according to the version played.{{sfn|Filloy Nadal|2001|p=30}}{{sfn|Leyenaar|2001|pp=125\u201326}}\n\nWhile the game was played casually for simple recreation, including by children and perhaps even women, the game also had important ritual aspects, and major formal ballgames were held as ritual events, often featuring human sacrifice.\n\n==== Astronomy ====\nMesoamerican [[astronomy]] included a broad understanding of the cycles of planets and other celestial bodies. Special importance was given to the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[Venus]] as the morning and evening star.\n\nObservatories were built at some sites, including the round observatory at [[Seibal|Ceibal]] and the \u201cObservatorio\u201d at [[Xochicalco]]. Often, the architectural organization of Mesoamerican sites was based on precise calculations derived from astronomical observations. Well-known examples of these include the [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] pyramid at Chichen Itza and the Observatorio at [[Xochicalco]]. A unique and common architectural complex found among many Mesoamerican sites are [[E-Group]]s, which are aligned so as to serve as astronomical observatories. The name of this complex is based on [[Uaxactun]]\u2019s \u201cGroup E,\u201d the first known observatory in the Maya area. Perhaps the earliest observatory documented in Mesoamerica is that of the [[Monte Alto culture]]. This complex consisted of three plain stelae and a temple oriented with respect to the [[Pleiades]].\n\n==== Symbolism of space and time ====\n[[File:Mexico0047.jpg|thumb|The [[Teotihuacan#Site layout|Avenue of the Dead]] in [[Teotihuacan]], an example of a Mesoamerican settlement planned according to concepts of directionality]]\n\nIt has been argued that among Mesoamerican societies the concepts of [[space]] and [[time]] are associated with the four [[cardinal points|cardinal compass points]] and linked together by the [[calendar]].<ref>Duverger 1999</ref> Dates or events were always tied to a compass direction, and the calendar specified the symbolic geographical characteristic peculiar to that period. Resulting from the significance held by the cardinal directions, many Mesoamerican architectural features, if not entire settlements, were planned and oriented with respect to directionality.\n\nIn Maya cosmology, each cardinal point was assigned a specific color and a specific jaguar deity ([[Maya mythology#Bacabs|Bacab]]). They are as follows:\n* '''[[Hacha-kyum|Hobnil]]''', Bacab of the [[East]], associated with the color red and the ''Kan'' years\n* '''[[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings#C|Can Tzicnal]]''', Bacab of the [[North]], assigned the color white and the ''Muluc'' years\n* '''[[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings#Z|Zac Cimi]]''', Bacab of the [[West]], associated with the color black and the ''Ix'' years\n* '''[[Hacha-kyum|Hozanek]]''', Bacab of the [[South]], associated with the color yellow and the ''Cauac'' years.\n\nLater cultures such as the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] and [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] maintain the association of cardinal directions with each color, but utilized different names.\n\nAmong the Aztec, the name of each day was associated with a cardinal point (thus conferring symbolic significance), and each cardinal direction was associated with a group of symbols. Below are the symbols and concepts associated with each direction:\n* '''East''': [[American crocodile|croco]] [[Morelet's crocodile|dile]], the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], [[water]], cane, and movement. The East was linked to the world priests and associated with vegetative fertility, or, in other words, tropical exuberance.\n* '''North''': wind, death, the dog, the jaguar, and [[flint]] (or [[chert]]). The north contrasts with the east in that it is conceptualized as dry, cold, and oppressive. It is considered the nocturnal part of the universe and includes the dwellings of the dead. The dog ([[xoloitzcuintle]]) has a very specific meaning, as it accompanies the deceased during the trip to the lands of the dead and helps them cross the river of death that leads into nothingness. (''See also'' [[Dogs in Mesoamerican folklore and myth]]).\n* '''West''': the house, the deer, the [[New World monkey|monkey]], the [[eagle]], and rain. The west was associated with the cycles of vegetation, specifically the temperate high plains that experience light rains and the change of seasons.\n* '''South''': rabbit, the [[lizard]], dried herbs, the [[New World vulture|buzzard]], and flowers. It is related on the one hand to the luminous Sun and the noon heat, and on the other with rain filled with alcoholic drink. The rabbit, the principal symbol of the west, was associated with farmers and with [[pulque]].\n\n=== Political and religious art ===\n{{Category see also|Mesoamerican art}}\n[[File:Tzompantli Tovar.jpeg|thumb|Art with ideological and political meaning: depiction of an [[Aztec]] ''[[tzompantli]]'' (skull-rack) from the [[Ramirez Codex]]]]\n\nMesoamerican [[art]]istic expression was conditioned by [[ideology]] and generally focused on themes of [[religion]] and/or sociopolitical [[Power (sociology)|power]]. This is largely based on the fact that most works that survived the Spanish conquest were public monuments. These monuments were typically erected by rulers who sought to visually legitimize their sociocultural and political position; by doing so, they intertwined their lineage, personal attributes and achievements, and legacy with religious concepts. As such, these monuments were specifically designed for public display and took many forms, including [[stele]], [[sculpture]], architectural [[relief]]s, and other types of architectural elements (e.g., roofcombs). Other themes expressed include tracking time, glorifying the city, and veneration of the gods\u2014all of which were tied to explicitly aggrandizing the abilities and the reign of the ruler who commissioned the artwork.\n\nThe majority are artwork created during this historical time was in relation to these topics, religion and politics. Rulers were drawn and sculpted. Historical tales and events were then translated into pieces of art, and art was used to relay religious and political messages.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{main|Maya music}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mesoamerica|Geography|Latin America}}\n<!-- {{Wikipedia-Books}} -->\n<!-- {{Main|Outline of Mesoamerica|Index of Mesoamerica-related articles}} -->\n<!-- *[[Bibliography of Mesoamerica]] -->\n*[[Americas (terminology)]]\n*[[Americas]]\n*[[Central America]]\n*[[Hispanic America]]\n*[[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]\n*[[Indigenous peoples of Mexico]]\n*[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n*[[Latin America]]\n*[[Mesoamerican region]]\n*[[Middle America (Americas)]]\n*[[Painting in the Americas before European colonization]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n{{Reflist}}\n{{div col end|2}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite book |title=Cambridge History of the Native peoples of The Americas |volume=2: Mesoamerica |editor1-first=Richard E.

Beginning as early as 7000 BCE, the domestication of [[chocolate|cacao]], [[maize]], [[phaseolus|beans]], [[tomato]], [[avocado]], [[vanilla]], [[squash (plant)|squash]] and [[Chili pepper|chili]], as well as the [[Meleagris gallopavo|turkey]] and [[Xoloitzcuintle|dog]], caused a transition from [[Paleo-Indians|paleo-Indian]] hunter-gatherer tribal grouping to the organization of sedentary agricultural villages. In the subsequent Formative period, agriculture and cultural traits such as a complex [[Mesoamerican religion|mythological and religious tradition]], a [[vigesimal]] numeric system, a [[Mesoamerican calendars|complex calendric system]], a [[Mesoamerican ballgame|tradition of ball playing]], and a distinct [[Mesoamerican architecture|architectural style]], were diffused through the area. Also in this period, villages began to become socially stratified and develop into [[chiefdom]]s with the development of large ceremonial centers, interconnected by a network of trade routes for the exchange of luxury goods, such as [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]], [[jade]], [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[cinnabar]], ''[[Spondylus]]'' shells, [[hematite]], and ceramics. While Mesoamerican civilization did know of the [[wheel]] and basic [[metallurgy]], neither of these technologies became culturally important.{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996|p=55}}\n\nAmong the earliest complex civilizations was the [[Olmec]] culture, which inhabited the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico]] and extended inland and southwards across the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]]. Frequent contact and cultural interchange between the early Olmec and other cultures in Chiapas, Guatemala and Oaxaca laid the basis for the Mesoamerican cultural area. All this was facilitated by considerable [[regional communications in ancient Mesoamerica]], especially along the Pacific coast.\n\nThis formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions, as well as artistic and architectural complexes. In the subsequent [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]], complex urban polities began to develop among the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], with the rise of centers such as [[El Mirador]], [[Calakmul]] and [[Tikal]], and the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] at [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]]. During this period, the first true [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] were developed in the [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] and the Zapotec cultures, and the Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic [[Maya script|Maya hieroglyphic script]].\n\nMesoamerica is one of only three regions of the world where writing is known to have independently developed (the others being ancient [[Sumer]] and China).<ref name=\"FaganBeck1996\">{{cite book|editor=Brian M.

Upon the collapse of Teotihuac\u00e1n around 600 AD, competition between several important political centers in central Mexico, such as [[Xochicalco]] and [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], ensued. At this time during the Epi-Classic period, the [[Nahua people]]s began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of [[Oto-Manguean languages]]. During the early post-Classic period, Central Mexico was dominated by the [[Toltec]] culture, Oaxaca by the [[Mixtec]], and the lowland Maya area had important centers at [[Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1]] and [[Mayap\u00e1n]]. Towards the end of the post-Classic period, the [[Aztec]]s of Central Mexico built a [[tributary states|tributary]] empire covering most of central Mesoamerica.{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996|pp=40\u201380}}\n\nThe distinct Mesoamerican cultural tradition ended with the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]] in the 16th century. Over the next centuries, Mesoamerican indigenous cultures were gradually subjected to Spanish colonial rule. Aspects of the Mesoamerican cultural heritage still survive among the indigenous peoples who inhabit Mesoamerica, many of whom continue to speak their ancestral languages, and maintain many practices harking back to their Mesoamerican roots.{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996}}\n\n== Etymology and definition ==\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=2 widths=70 heights=70 mode=nolines caption=\"Ancient Mesoamerican sites in [[El Salvador]]\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Pinturas Rupestres Corinto Morazan 06.JPG|[[Holy Spirit Grotto]]\nFile:Temazcal en Joya de Cer\u00e9n.jpg|[[Joya de Cer\u00e9n]]\nFile:Tazumal 10.jpg|[[Tazumal]]\nFile:Casa Blanca 1.JPG|[[Casa Blanca, El Salvador|Casa Blanca]]\nFile:ES SanAndres 06 2011 Panorama Estructura 1 y 2 La Acropolis 2194.jpg|[[San Andr\u00e9s, El Salvador|San Andres]]\nFile:Piramide Cihuatan.jpg|[[Cihuat\u00e1n]]\n</gallery>\n}}\n\nThe term ''Mesoamerica'' literally means \"middle America\" in Greek. [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]] often refers to a larger area in the Americas, but it has also previously been used more narrowly to refer to Mesoamerica. An example is the title of the 16 volumes of ''The Handbook of Middle American Indians''.  \"Mesoamerica\" is broadly defined as the area that is home to the Mesoamerican civilization, which comprises a group of peoples with close cultural and historical ties. The exact geographic extent of Mesoamerica has varied through time, as the civilization extended North and South from its heartland in southern Mexico. The term was first used by the [[Germany|German]] [[ethnology|ethnologist]] [[Paul Kirchhoff]], who noted that similarities existed among the various [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian cultures]] within the region that included southern [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[El Salvador]], western [[Honduras]], and the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] lowlands of [[Nicaragua]] and northwestern [[Costa Rica]]. In the tradition of [[culture-historical archaeology|cultural history]], the prevalent [[archaeological theory]] of the early to middle 20th century, Kirchhoff defined this zone as a cultural area based on a suite of interrelated cultural similarities brought about by millennia of inter- and intra-regional interaction (i.e., [[trans-cultural diffusion|diffusion]]).{{sfn|Kirchhoff|1943}}{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996|pp=5\u20138}} Mesoamerica is recognized as a near-prototypical cultural area, and the term is now fully integrated in the standard terminology of pre-Columbian [[cultural anthropology|anthropological]] studies. Conversely, the sister terms [[Aridoamerica]] and [[Oasisamerica]], which refer to northern Mexico and the western [[United States]], respectively, have not entered into widespread usage.\n\nSome of the significant cultural traits defining the Mesoamerican cultural tradition are:\n* [[sedentism]] based on [[maize]] [[agriculture]]\n* the construction of [[mesoamerican pyramids|stepped pyramids]]\n* the use of two different [[mesoamerican calendars|calendars]] (a 260-day ritual calendar and a 365-day calendar based on the [[solar year]])\n* [[vigesimal]] (base 20) number system\n* the use of locally developed [[pictogram|pictographic]] and [[hieroglyph]]ic (logo-syllabic) [[mesoamerican writing systems|writing systems]]\n* the use of [[natural rubber]] and the practice of the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]]\n* the use of [[amate|bark paper]] and [[agave]] for ritual purposes and as a medium for writing and the latter also for cooking and clothing\n* the practice of various forms of ritualistic [[sacrifice]], including [[human sacrifice]]\n* a [[mesoamerican religion|religious complex]] based on a combination of [[shamanism]] and natural deities, and a shared system of symbols\n* a [[sprachbund|linguistic area]] defined by a [[mesoamerican language area|number of grammatical traits]] that have spread through the area by diffusion{{sfn|Campbell|Kaufman|Smith-Stark|1986}}\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Mesoamerica}}\n[[File:Flickr - archer10 (Dennis) - Guatemala 1828 - La Danta at the Mayan site of El Mirador.jpg|thumb|[[El Mirador]] flourished from 600 BCE to 100 CE, and may have had a population of over 100,000.]]\n[[File:Puebla farmers.jpg|right|thumb|Landscape of the Mesoamerican highlands]]\nLocated on the [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle American]] [[isthmus]] joining North and [[South America]] between ''ca.'' 10\u00b0 and 22\u00b0 northern [[latitude]], Mesoamerica possesses a complex combination of ecological systems, topographic zones, and environmental contexts. A main distinction groups these different [[ecological niche|niches]] into two broad categories: the lowlands (those areas between [[sea level]] and 1000 meters) and the ''altiplanos'', or highlands (situated between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level).{{sfn|Coe|1994}}{{sfn|Carmack|Gasco|Gossen|1996|pp=9\u201311}} In the low-lying regions, [[subtropical climate|sub-tropical]] and [[tropical climate]]s are most common, as is true for most of the coastline along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The highlands show much more climatic diversity, ranging from dry tropical to cold [[mountain climate|mountainous climates]]; the dominant climate is [[temperateness|temperate]] with warm temperatures and moderate rainfall. The rainfall varies from the dry [[Oaxaca]] and north [[Yucat\u00e1n]] to the humid southern Pacific and Caribbean lowlands.\n\n=== Cultural sub-areas ===\nSeveral distinct sub-regions within Mesoamerica are defined by a convergence of geographic and cultural attributes. These sub-regions are more conceptual than culturally meaningful, and the demarcation of their limits is not rigid. The Maya area, for example, can be divided into two general groups: the lowlands and highlands. The lowlands are further divided into the southern and northern Maya lowlands. The southern Maya lowlands are generally regarded as encompassing northern [[Guatemala]], southern [[Campeche]] and [[Quintana Roo]] in [[Mexico]], and [[Belize]]. The northern lowlands cover the remainder of the northern portion of the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. Other areas include Central Mexico, West Mexico, the Gulf Coast Lowlands, [[Oaxaca]], the Southern Pacific Lowlands, and Southeast Mesoamerica (including northern [[Honduras]]).\n\n=== Topography ===\nThere is extensive topographic variation in Mesoamerica, ranging from the high peaks circumscribing the [[Valley of Mexico]] and within the central [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas|Sierra Madre]] mountains to the low flatlands of the northern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The tallest mountain in Mesoamerica is [[Pico de Orizaba]], a [[dormant volcano]] located on the border of [[Puebla]] and [[Veracruz]]. Its peak elevation is 5,636&nbsp;m (18,490&nbsp;ft).\n\nThe Sierra Madre mountains, which consist of several smaller ranges, run from northern Mesoamerica south through [[Costa Rica]]. The chain is historically [[Volcano|volcanic]]. In central and southern Mexico, a portion of the Sierra Madre chain is known as the [[Eje Volc\u00e1nico Transversal]], or the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt. There are 83 inactive and active volcanoes within the Sierra Madre range, including 11 in Mexico, 37 in Guatemala, 23 in El Salvador, 25 in Nicaragua, and 3 in northwestern Costa Rica. According to the Michigan Technological University,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.mtu.edu/volcanoes/world.html |title=MTU Volcanoes Page \u2013 World Reference Map |publisher=Geo.mtu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref> 16 of these are still active. The tallest active volcano is [[Popocat\u00e9petl]] at 5,452&nbsp;m (17,887&nbsp;ft). This volcano, which retains its [[Nahuatl]] name, is located 70&nbsp;km (43&nbsp;mi) southeast of [[Mexico City]]. Other volcanoes of note include Tacana on the Mexico\u2013Guatemala border, [[Volc\u00e1n Tajumulco|Tajumulco]] and [[Santamar\u00eda (volcano)|Santamar\u00eda]] in Guatemala, [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]] in El Salvador, [[Momotombo]] in Nicaragua, and [[Arenal Volcano|Arenal]] in Costa Rica.\n\nOne important topographic feature is the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]], a low plateau that breaks up the Sierra Madre chain between the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] to the north and the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]] to the south. At its highest point, the [[Isthmus]] is 224&nbsp;m (735&nbsp;ft) above mean sea level. This area also represents the shortest distance between the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] in Mexico. The distance between the two coasts is roughly 200&nbsp;km (120&nbsp;mi). The northern side of the Isthmus is swampy and covered in dense jungle\u2014but the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, as the lowest and most level point within the Sierra Madre mountain chain, was nonetheless a main transportation, communication, and economic route within Mesoamerica.\n\n=== Bodies of water ===\nOutside of the northern Maya lowlands, [[river]]s are common throughout Mesoamerica. Some of the more important ones served as loci of human occupation in the area. The longest river in Mesoamerica is the [[Usumacinta]], which forms in Guatemala at the convergence of the [[Salinas River (Guatemala)|Salinas]] or [[Chixoy River|Chixoy]] and La [[Pasion River]] and runs north for 970&nbsp;km (600&nbsp;mi)\u2014480&nbsp;km (300&nbsp;mi) of which are navigable\u2014eventually draining into the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Other rivers of note include the [[Rio Grande de Santiago]], the [[Grijalva River]], the [[Motagua River]], the [[Ul\u00faa River]], and the [[Hondo River (Belize)|Hondo River]]. The northern Maya lowlands, especially the northern portion of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, are notable for their nearly complete lack of rivers (largely due to the absolute lack of topographic variation). Additionally, no lakes exist in the northern peninsula. The main source of water in this area is [[aquifer]]s that are accessed through natural surface openings called [[cenote]]s.\n\nWith an area of 8,264&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (3,191&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), [[Lake Nicaragua]] is the largest lake in Mesoamerica. [[Lake Chapala]] is Mexico's largest freshwater lake, but [[Lake Texcoco]] is perhaps most well known as the location upon which [[Tenochtitlan]], capital of the [[Aztec]] Empire, was founded. [[Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1]], in northern Guatemala, is notable as where the last independent Maya city, [[Tayasal]] (or Noh Pet\u00e9n), held out against the Spanish until 1697. Other large lakes include [[Lake Atitl\u00e1n]], [[Lake Izabal]], [[Geography of El Salvador|Lake G\u00fcija]], [[Lemoa]], and [[Lake Managua]].\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\nAlmost all [[ecosystem]]s are present in Mesoamerica; the more well known are the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]], the second largest in the world, and [[La Mosquitia]] (consisting of the [[Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve]], [[Tawahka Asangni]], [[Patuca National Park]], and [[Bosawas Biosphere Reserve]]) a [[rainforest]] second in size in the Americas only to the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2006/1718459.htm |title=Science Show \u2013 Bosawas Bioreserve Nicaragua |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2006-08-19 |accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref> The highlands present [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|mixed]] and [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] forest. The biodiversity is among the richest in the world, though the number of species in the red list of the [[IUCN]] grows every year.\n\n== Chronology and culture ==\n{{Main|Mesoamerican chronology}}\n[[File:Tikal mayan ruins 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Tikal]] is one of the largest archaeological sites, urban centers, and tourist attractions of the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]]. It is located in the archaeological region of the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin]] in what is now northern [[Guatemala]].]]\n\nThe history of human occupation in Mesoamerica is divided into stages or periods. These are known, with slight variation depending on region, as the [[Paleo-Indian]], the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Archaic Era|Archaic]], the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Preclassic]] (or Formative), the [[Classic Period|Classic]], and the [[Postclassic period|Postclassic]]. The last three periods, representing the core of Mesoamerican cultural fluorescence, are further divided into two or three sub-phases. Most of the time following the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century is classified as the Colonial period.\n\nThe differentiation of early periods (i.e., up through the end of the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Late Preclassic]]) generally reflects [[Sociocultural evolution|different configurations of socio-cultural organization]] that are characterized by [[Urgesellschaft|increasing socio-political complexity]], the adoption of new and different [[List of subsistence techniques|subsistence strategies]], and changes in economic organization (including increased interregional interaction). The [[Classic Period|Classic]] period through the [[Postclassic period|Postclassic]] are differentiated by the cyclical crystallization and fragmentation of the various political entities throughout Mesoamerica.\n\n=== Paleo-Indian ===\nThe Mesoamerican Paleo-Indian period precedes the advent of agriculture and is characterized by a nomadic [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and gathering]] subsistence strategy. Big-game hunting, similar to that seen in contemporaneous [[North America]], was a large component of the subsistence strategy of the Mesoamerican Paleo-Indian.  These sites had [[obsidian]] blades and [[Clovis point|Clovis]]-style fluted [[projectile point]]s.\n\n=== Archaic ===\nThe Archaic period (8000\u20132000 BCE) is characterized by the rise of [[Agriculture in Mesoamerica|incipient agriculture]] in Mesoamerica. The initial phases of the Archaic involved the cultivation of wild plants, transitioning into informal domestication and culminating with [[sedentism]] and agricultural production by the close of the period.

The earliest Maya sites coalesced after 1000 BCE, and include [[Nakbe]], [[El Mirador]], and [[Cerros]]. Middle to Late [[Preclassic Maya]] sites include [[Kaminaljuy\u00fa]], [[Cival]], [[Edzn\u00e1]], [[Cob\u00e1]], [[Lamanai]], [[Komchen]], [[Dzibilchaltun]], and [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], among others.\n\nThe Preclassic in the central Mexican highlands is represented by such sites as [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya]], [[Tlatilco]], and [[Cuicuilco]]. These sites were eventually superseded by [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]], an important Classic-era site that eventually dominated economic and interaction spheres throughout Mesoamerica. The settlement of Teotihuacan is dated to the later portion of the Late Preclassic, or roughly 50 CE.\n\nIn the [[Valley of Oaxaca]], [[San Jos\u00e9 Mogote]] represents one of the oldest permanent agricultural villages in the area, and one of the first to use pottery. During the Early and Middle Preclassic, the site developed some of the earliest examples of defensive [[palisade]]s, ceremonial structures, the use of [[adobe]], and [[Zapotec writing|hieroglyphic writing]]. Also of importance, the site was one of the first to demonstrate [[ascribed status|inherited status]], signifying a radical shift in socio-cultural and political structure. San Jos\u00e9 Mogote was eventual overtaken by [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]], the subsequent capital of the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec empire]], during the Late Preclassic.\n\nThe Preclassic in western Mexico, in the states of [[Nayarit]], [[Jalisco]], [[Colima]], and [[Michoac\u00e1n]] also known as the Occidente, is poorly understood. This period is best represented by the thousands of figurines recovered by looters and ascribed to the \"[[Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition|shaft tomb tradition]]\".\n\n====Preclassic gallery====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Acr\u00f3bata de Tlatilco.JPG|Sculpture of \"The Acrobat\" from [[Tlatilco]].\nFile:Pir\u00e1mide de Cuicuilco al Sur del Distrito Federal.jpg|[[Cuicuilco]] 800\u2013600 BCE\nFile:Nakbe str.JPG|[[Nakb\u00e9]], Mid Preclassic (600 BCE) Palace remains, The Mirador Basin\nFile:San Jose Mogote Pyramid.jpg|The partly excavated main structure of [[San Jose Mogote]] 1500\u2013500 BCE\nFile:Montealban el observatorio.JPG|[[Monte Alban]], Building J in the foreground. 200 BCE \u2013 200 CE\n</gallery>\n\n=== Classic ===\n\n==== Early Classic ====\n[[File:Piramide de la Luna 072006.jpg|thumb|[[Pyramid of the Moon]] viewed from atop of the [[Pyramid of the Sun]].]]\nThe Classic period is marked by the rise and dominance of several polities. The traditional distinction between the Early and Late Classic are marked by their changing fortune and their ability to maintain regional primacy. Of paramount importance are Teotihuac\u00e1n in central Mexico and [[Tikal]] in Guatemala; the Early Classic's temporal limits generally correlate to the main periods of these sites. Monte Alban in Oaxaca is another Classic-period polity that expanded and flourished during this period, but the Zapotec capital exerted less interregional influence than the other two sites.\n\nDuring the Early Classic, Teotihuacan participated in and perhaps dominated a far-reaching macro-regional interaction network. Architectural and artifact styles (talud-tablero, tripod slab-footed ceramic vessels) epitomized at Teotihuacan were mimicked and adopted at many distant settlements. [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|Pachuca]] obsidian, whose trade and distribution is argued to have been economically controlled by Teotihuacan, is found throughout Mesoamerica.\n\nTikal came to dominate much of the southern Maya lowlands politically, economically, and militarily during the Early Classic. An exchange network centered at Tikal distributed a variety of goods and commodities throughout southeast Mesoamerica, such as obsidian imported from central Mexico (e.g., Pachuca) and highland Guatemala (e.g., [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|El Chayal]], which was predominantly used by the Maya during the Early Classic), and [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] from the [[Motagua River|Motagua valley]] in Guatemala. Tikal was often in conflict with other polities in the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin]], as well as with others outside of it, including [[Uaxactun]], [[Caracol, Belize|Caracol]], [[Dos Pilas]], [[Naranjo]], and [[Calakmul]]. Towards the end of the Early Classic, this conflict lead to Tikal's military defeat at the hands of Caracol in 562, and a period commonly known as the [[Tikal#Tikal hiatus|Tikal Hiatus]].\n\n=====Early Classic gallery =====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Teotihuac\u00e1n - Chalchiuhtlicue.jpg|[[Great Goddess of Teotihuacan]] 200\u2013500 CE\nFile:Teuchitlan scale model 1.jpg|A reconstruction of [[Guachimontones]], flourished from 200\u2013400 CE\nFile:Dzibanche, Building 1, Temple of the Owl (14364450242).jpg|Temple of the Owl, Dzibanche 200\u2013600 CE\nFile:Acanceh1.jpg|Acanceh, 200\u2013300 CE<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/features/acanceh/history.html|title=Mesoweb Articles|work=mesoweb.com}}</ref>\nFile:Kohunlich Mask cropped.jpg|Mask located on the \"Temple of the Masks\" [[Kohunlich]] c. 500 CE\n</gallery>\n\n==== Late Classic ====\n[[File:Xochicalco Serpiente Emplumada GR.jpg|thumb|[[Xochicalco]], Temple of the Feathered Serpent, 650\u2013900 CE]]\nThe Late Classic period (beginning c. 600 CE until 909 CE) is characterized as a period of interregional competition and factionalization among the numerous regional polities in the Maya area. This largely resulted from the decrease in Tikal's socio-political and economic power at the beginning of the period. It was therefore during this time that other sites rose to regional prominence and were able to exert greater interregional influence, including Caracol, [[Cop\u00e1n]], [[Palenque]], and Calakmul (which was allied with Caracol and may have assisted in the defeat of Tikal), and [[Dos Pilas]] [[Aguateca]] and [[Cancu\u00e9n]] in the [[Petexbat\u00fan]] region of Guatemala. Around 710, Tikal arose again and started to build strong alliances and defeat its worst enemies. In the Maya area, the Late Classic ended with the so-called \"[[Maya collapse]]\", a transitional period coupling the general depopulation of the southern lowlands and development and florescence of centers in the northern lowlands.\n\n=====Late Classic gallery=====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:PalacefromTempleCrossPalenque.JPG|Main palace of Palenque, 7th century CE\nFile:Palenque - Maske des Pakal.jpg|[[K'inich Janaab Pakal I]] of [[Palenque]] 603\u2013683 CE\nFile:Copan St H.jpg|Copan Stela H commissioned by [[Uaxaclajuun Ub\u02bcaah K\u02bcawiil]] 695\u2013738 CE\nFile:Jaina Figurine 1 (T Aleto).jpg|[[Jaina Island]] type figure (Maya) 650\u2013800 CE\nFile:VestidosDeSacerdotes(Hombre-Ave).jpg|[[Cacaxtla]], Mural depicting the Bird Man 650\u2013900 CE\n\n</gallery>\n\n==== Terminal Classic ====\n[[File:0077 Uxmal.JPG|thumb|Detail of the Nunnery Quadrangle at [[Uxmal]], 10th century]]\nGenerally applied to the Maya area, the Terminal Classic roughly spans the time between C. 800/850 and c. 1000 CE. Overall, it generally correlates with the rise to prominence of [[Puuc]] settlements in the northern Maya lowlands, so named after the hills where they are mainly found. Puuc settlements are specifically associated with a unique architectural style (the \"Puuc architectural style\") that represents a technological departure from previous construction techniques. Major Puuc sites include [[Uxmal]], [[Sayil]], [[Labna]], [[Kabah (Maya site)|Kabah]], and [[Oxkintok]]. While generally concentrated within the area in and around the Puuc hills, the style has been documented as far away as at [[Chichen Itza]] to the east and [[Edzna]] to the south.\n\nChich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 was originally thought to have been a Postclassic site in the northern Maya lowlands. Research over the past few decades has established that it was first settled during the Early/Late Classic transition but rose to prominence during the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic. During its apogee, this widely known site economically and politically dominated the northern lowlands. Its participation in the circum-peninsular exchange route, possible through its port site of [[Isla Cerritos]], allowed Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 to remain highly connected to areas such as central Mexico and [[Central America]]. The apparent \"Mexicanization\" of architecture at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 led past researchers to believe that Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 existed under the control of a Toltec empire. Chronological data refutes this early interpretation, and it is now known that Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 predated the Toltec; Mexican architectural styles are now used as an indicator of strong economic and ideological ties between the two regions.\n\n=====Terminal Classic gallery=====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Great Ball Court Chichen Itza 03 2011 1423.jpg|Chichen Itza, Temple of the Jaguars 900\u20131000 CE\nFile:Uxmal - Palacio 16.jpg|Governor's Palace rear view and details,  10th century CE, [[Uxmal]]\nFile:Temple of the Masks, Kabah (8264867094).jpg|Codz Poop,  7th\u201310th centuries CE [[Kabah (Maya site)|Kabah]]\nFile:Sayil Ruta Puuc 1.JPG|[[Sayil]], three-story palace, 600\u2013900 CE\nFile:Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 - 29.jpg|Chichen Itza, \"Temple of Three Dintels\" 600\u20131000 CE\n</gallery>\n\n=== Postclassic ===\nThe Postclassic (beginning 900\u20131000 CE, depending on area) is, like the Late Classic, characterized by the cyclical crystallization and fragmentation of various polities. The main Maya centers were located in the northern lowlands. Following Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, whose political structure collapsed during the Early Postclassic, [[Mayap\u00e1n]] rose to prominence during the Middle Postclassic and dominated the north for c. 200 years. After Mayap\u00e1n's fragmentation, political structure in the northern lowlands revolved around large towns or city-states, such as [[Oxkutzcab]] and [[Ti\u2019ho]] ([[M\u00e9rida, Yucat\u00e1n]]), that competed with one another.\n\n[[File:Mesoam\u00e9rica y Centroamerica prehispanica siglo XVI.svg|thumb|Mesoamerica and Central America in the 16th century before Spanish arrival]]\n\n[[Tonin\u00e1]], in the Chiapas highlands, and [[Kaminaljuy\u00fa]] in the central Guatemala highlands, were important southern highland Maya centers. The latter site, Kaminaljuy\u00fa, is one of the longest occupied sites in Mesoamerica and was continuously inhabited from c. 800 BCE to around 1200 CE. Other important highland Maya groups include the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] of [[Utatl\u00e1n]], the [[Mam people|Mam]] in [[Zaculeu]], the [[Poqomam language|Poqomam]] in [[Mixco Viejo]], and the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] at [[Iximche]] in the Guatemalan highlands. The [[Pipil people|Pipil]] resided in [[El Salvador]], while the [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']] were in eastern Guatemala and northwestern [[Honduras]].\n\nIn central Mexico, the early portion of the Postclassic correlates with the rise of the [[Toltec]] and an empire based at their capital, [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]] (also known as [[Tollan]]). [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], initially an important Early Classic center contemporaneous with Teotihuacan, maintained its political structure (it did not collapse) and continued to function as a regionally important center during the Postclassic. The latter portion of the Postclassic is generally associated with the rise of the [[Mexica]] and the [[Aztec Empire]]. One of the more commonly known cultural groups in Mesoamerica, the Aztec politically dominated nearly all of central Mexico, the Gulf Coast, Mexico's southern Pacific Coast (Chiapas and into Guatemala), Oaxaca, and [[Guerrero]].\n\nThe [[Tarascan state|Tarascans]] (also known as the [[Pur\u00e9pecha people|P'urh\u00e9pecha]]) were located in [[Michoac\u00e1n]] and Guerrero. With their capital at [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]], the Tarascan state was one of the few to actively and continuously resist Aztec domination during the Late Postclassic. Other important Postclassic cultures in Mesoamerica include the [[Totonac]] along the eastern coast (in the modern-day states of [[Veracruz]], [[Puebla]], and [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]]). The [[Huastec people|Huastec]] resided north of the Totonac, mainly in the modern-day states of [[Tamaulipas]] and northern Veracruz. The [[Mixtec]] and Zapotec cultures, centered at [[Mitla]] and [[Zaachila]] respectively, inhabited Oaxaca.\n\nThe Postclassic ends with the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|arrival of the Spanish]] and their subsequent conquest of the Aztec between 1519 and 1521. Many other cultural groups did not acquiesce until later. For example, Maya groups in the Pet\u00e9n area, including the [[Itza]] at [[Tayasal]] and the [[Kowoj]] at [[Zacpeten]], remained independent until 1697.\n\nSome Mesoamerican cultures never achieved dominant status or left impressive archaeological remains but are nevertheless noteworthy. These include the [[Otomi people|Otomi]], [[Mixe\u2013Zoquean languages|Mixe\u2013Zoque]] groups (which may or may not have been related to the Olmecs), the northern [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] groups, often referred to as the [[Chichimeca]], that include the [[Cora people|Cora]] and [[Huichol people|Huichol]], the Chontales, the Huaves, and the Pipil, Xincan and Lencan peoples of Central America.\n\n====Postclassic gallery====\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Zona Arqueol\u00f3gica Mitla 10.JPG|Palace of [[Mitla]], Oaxaca 12th century\nFile:TlatelolcoSite01.JPG|The Calendar temple of [[Tlatelolco (archaeological site)|Tlatelolco]], 1200 CE\nFile:Codex Zouche-Nuttall, page 20.jpg|Detail of page 20 from the [[Codex Zouche-Nuttall]], 14\u201315th century\nFile:Escudo De Yanhuitl\u00e1n.jpg|Pectoral mixtec, Shield of Yanhuitlan.\nFile:Musee National Anthropologie-Calendrier Maya.jpg|[[Aztec sun stone]], early 16th century\n</gallery>\n\n===Chronology in chart form===\n{{Main|Mesoamerican chronology}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:175px;\"|Period\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Timespan\n! style=\"width:675px;\"|Important cultures, cities\n|- style=\"background:silver\"\n|+'''Summary of the chronology and cultures of Mesoamerica'''\n|[[History of Mesoamerica (Paleo-Indian)|Paleo-Indian]]\n|10,000\u20133500 BCE\n|Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, obsidian and pyrite points, Iztapan\n|-=\"background:silver\"\n|[[Mesoamerican chronology#Archaic Era|Archaic]]\n|3500\u20131800 BCE\n|Agricultural settlements, [[Tehuac\u00e1n, Puebla|Tehuac\u00e1n]]\n|- style=\"background:silver\"\n|[[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era|Preclassic (Formative)]]\n|2000 BCE \u2013 250 CE\n|Unknown culture in [[La Blanca]] and [[Ujuxte]], [[Monte Alto culture]]\n|-\n|Early Preclassic\n|2000\u20131000 BCE\n|Olmec area: [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan]]; Central Mexico: [[Chalcatzingo]]; Valley of Oaxaca: [[San Jos\u00e9 Mogote]].

The earliest example of [[maize]] dates to c. 4000 BCE and comes from [[Guil\u00e1 Naquitz]], a cave in Oaxaca. Earlier maize samples have been documented at the Los Ladrones cave site in [[Panama]], c. 5500 BCE.<ref>{{cite web|title=Los Ladrones cave site|url=http://www.uacam.mx/.../ee8480fb39dbff8e86256ad3004e1394/$FILE/ATT4M6OX/Campeche%202002%20paper.pdf|publisher=UAC|access-date=2007-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215205412/http://www.uacam.mx/.../ee8480fb39dbff8e86256ad3004e1394/$FILE/ATT4M6OX/Campeche%202002%20paper.pdf|archive-date=2012-02-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> Slightly thereafter, semi-[[agrarian community|agrarian communities]] began to cultivate other crops throughout Mesoamerica.<ref>O'Brien (2005), p. 25.</ref> Maize was the most common domesticate, but the common bean, tepary bean, scarlet runner bean, [[jicama]], [[tomato]] and squash all became common cultivates by 3500 BCE. At the same time, these communities exploited [[cotton]], [[yucca]], and [[agave]] for fibers and [[textile]] materials.<ref>Diamond (1999), pp. 126\u201327.</ref> By 2000 BCE, corn was the staple crop in the region, and remained so through modern times. The Ram\u00f3n or [[Brosimum alicastrum|Breadnut tree]] (''[[Brosimum alicastrum]]'') was an occasional substitute for maize in producing flour. Fruit was also important in the daily diet of Mesoamerican cultures. Some of the main ones consumed include [[avocado]], [[papaya]], [[guava]], [[mamey (disambiguation)|mamey]], [[Sapote|zapote]], and [[annona]].\n\nMesoamerica lacked animals suitable for domestication, most notably domesticated large [[ungulate]]s. The lack of [[draft animals]] for transportation is one notable difference between Mesoamerica and the cultures of the South American Andes. Other animals, including the [[duck]], [[dog]]s, and [[wild turkey|turkey]], were [[domestication|domesticated]]. Turkey was the first, occurring around 3500 BCE.<ref>Diamond (1999) p. 100.</ref> [[Dog meat|Dogs]] were the primary source of animal protein in ancient Mesoamerica,<ref>Coe (1994), p. 45 (\"The only domestic animals were dogs\u2014the principal source of meat for much of Preclassic Mesoamerica\u2014and turkeys\u2014understandably rare because that familiar bird consumes very large quantities of corn and is thus expensive to raise\".)</ref> and dog bones are common in midden deposits throughout the region.\n\nSocieties of this region did hunt certain wild species for food. These animals included deer, [[rabbit]], birds, and various types of insects. They also hunted for luxury items, such as feline fur and bird plumage.<ref>Diamond (1999).</ref>\n\nMesoamerican cultures that lived in the lowlands and coastal plains settled down in agrarian communities somewhat later than did highland cultures due to the fact that there was a greater abundance of fruits and animals in these areas, which made a hunter-gatherer lifestyle more attractive.<ref>O'Brien (2005), p. 25</ref> Fishing also was a major provider of food to lowland and coastal Mesoamericans creating a further disincentive to settle down in permanent communities.\n\n=== Political organization ===\n[[File:ChanBahlumCatherwood.jpg|thumb|upright|[[K'inich Kan B'alam II]], the Classic period ruler of [[Palenque]], as depicted on a [[stele]]]]\n\nCeremonial centers were the nuclei of Mesoamerican settlements. The temples provided spatial orientation, which was imparted to the surrounding town. The cities with their commercial and religious centers were always political entities, somewhat similar to the European [[city-state]], and each person could identify with the city where they lived.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nCeremonial centers were always built to be visible. Pyramids were meant to stand out from the rest of the city, to represent the gods and their powers. Another characteristic feature of the ceremonial centers is historic layers. All the ceremonial edifices were built in various phases, one on top of the other, to the point that what we now see is usually the last stage of construction. Ultimately, the ceremonial centers were the architectural translation of the identity of each city, as represented by the veneration of their gods and masters.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} [[Stela]]e were common public monuments throughout Mesoamerica, and served to commemorate notable successes, events and dates associated with the rulers and nobility of the various sites.\n\n=== Economy ===\n{{See also|Trade in Maya civilization}}\n\nGiven that Mesoamerica was broken into numerous and diverse ecological niches, none of the societies that inhabited the area were self-sufficient.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} For this reason, from the last centuries of the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] period (8000 BC\u2013 1000 BC) onward, regions compensated for the environmental inadequacies by specializing in the extraction of certain abundant natural resources and then trading them for necessary unavailable resources through established commercial trade networks.\n\nThe following is a list of some of the specialized resources traded from the various Mesoamerican sub-regions and environmental contexts:\n* Pacific lowlands: [[cotton]] and [[cochineal]]\n* Maya lowlands and the Gulf Coast: [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], [[vanilla]], [[jaguar]] skins, birds and bird feathers (especially [[quetzal]] and [[macaw]])\n* Central Mexico: Obsidian ([[Pachuca]])\n* Guatemalan highlands: Obsidian ([[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|San Martin Jilotepeque]], [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|El Chayal]], and [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica#Sources|Ixtepeque]]), [[pyrite]], and [[jade]] from the [[Motagua River]] valley\n* Coastal areas: [[salt]], dry [[fish]], [[Animal shell|shell]], and [[dye]]s\n\n== Common characteristics of Mesoamerican culture ==\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Mesoamerican architecture}}\n{{Empty section|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== Calendrical systems ===\n{{main|Mesoamerican calendars}}\n[[File:Maya days.jpg|thumb|\"Head Variant\" or \"Patron Gods\" glyphs for Maya days]]\n[[File:Tikalemblem.jpg|thumb|The [[Maya script|emblem glyph]] of Tikal (Mutal)]]\n\nAgriculturally based people historically divide the year into four seasons. These included the two [[solstices]] and the two [[equinoxes]], which could be thought of as the four \"directional pillars\" that support the year. These four times of the year were, and still are, important as they indicate seasonal changes that directly impact the lives of Mesoamerican agriculturalists.\n\nThe Maya closely observed and duly recorded the seasonal markers. They prepared almanacs recording past and recent solar and [[lunar eclipses]], the phases of the [[moon]], the periods of [[Venus]] and [[Mars]], the movements of various other planets, and conjunctions of celestial bodies. These almanacs also made future predictions concerning celestial events. These tables are remarkably accurate, given the technology available, and indicate a significant level of knowledge among Maya [[astronomer]]s.<ref>Roxanne V. Pacheco, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030718193206/http://www.unm.edu/~abqteach/ArcheoCUs/99-01-08.pdf Myths of Mesoamerican Cultures Reflect a Knowledge and Practice of Astronomy], University of New Mexico, ''archived'' July 18, 2003 (accessed January 25, 2016).</ref>\n\nAmong the many types of calendars the Maya maintained, the most important include a 260-day cycle, a 360-day cycle or 'year', a 365-day cycle or year, a lunar cycle, and a Venus cycle, which tracked the [[synodic]] period of Venus. Maya of the European contact period said that knowing the past aided in both understanding the present and predicting the future (Diego de Landa). The 260-day cycle was a calendar to govern agriculture, observe religious holidays, mark the movements of celestial bodies and memorialize public officials. The 260-day cycle was also used for divination, and (like the Catholic calendar of saints) to name newborns.<ref>Bernardino de Sahagun, Historia de las cosas de Nueva Espana; Diego Duran, The Book of The Gods and Rites, Oklahoma; The Books of [[Chilam Balam]] of Mani, Kaua, and Chumayel.</ref>\n\nThe names given to the days, months, and years in the Mesoamerican calendar came, for the most part, from animals, flowers, heavenly bodies, and cultural concepts that held symbolic significance in Mesoamerican culture. This calendar was used throughout the history of Mesoamerican by nearly every culture. Even today, several Maya groups in Guatemala, including the [[K'iche' people|K'iche']], [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']], [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]], and the [[Mixe]] people of Oaxaca continue using modernized forms of the Mesoamerican calendar.\n\n=== Writing systems ===\n{{Main|Mesoamerican writing systems}}\n[[File:La Mojarra Estela 1 (Escritura superior).jpg|thumb|One of the earliest examples of the [[Mesoamerican writing systems]], the [[Epi-Olmec script]] on the [[La Mojarra Stela 1]] dated to around 150 CE. Mesoamerica is one of the five places in the world where [[writing]] has developed independently.]]\nThe Mesoamerican scripts deciphered to date are [[logosyllabary|logosyllabic]] combining the use of [[logograms]] with a [[syllabary]], and they are often called [[hieroglyph]]ic scripts. Five or six different scripts have been documented in Mesoamerica, but archaeological dating methods, and a certain degree of self-interest, create difficulties in establishing priority and thus the forebear from which the others developed. The best documented and deciphered Mesoamerican writing system, and therefore the most widely known, is the classic [[Maya script]]. Others include the [[Olmec hieroglyphs|Olmec]], Zapotec, and [[Epi-Olmec script|Epi-Olmec/Isthmian]] writing systems. An extensive [[Mesoamerican literature]] has been conserved partly in indigenous scripts and partly in the postinvasion transcriptions into [[Latin script]].\n\nThe other [[glyph (archaeology)|glyphic]] writing systems of Mesoamerica, and their interpretation, have been subject to much debate. One important ongoing discussion regards whether non-Maya Mesoamerican texts can be considered examples of true writing or whether non-Maya Mesoamerican texts are best understood as [[pictographic]] conventions that express ideas, specifically religious ones, but don't represent the phonetics of spoken language.\n\nMesoamerican writing is found in several mediums, including large stone monuments such as [[stelae]], carved directly onto architecture, carved or painted over stucco (e.g., [[murals]]), and on [[pottery]]. No Precolumbian Mesoamerican society is known to have had widespread literacy, and literacy was probably restricted to particular social classes, including scribes, painters, merchants, and the nobility.\n\nThe Mesoamerican book was typically written with brush and colored inks on a paper prepared from the inner bark of the ficus amacus. The book consisted of a long strip of the prepared bark, which was folded like a screenfold to define individual pages. The pages were often covered and protected by elaborately carved book boards. Some books were composed of square pages while others were composed of rectangular pages.\n\nFollowing the Spanish conquests in the sixteenth century, Spanish friars taught indigenous scribes to write their languages in alphabetic texts. Many oral histories of the prehispanic period were subsequently recorded in alphabetic texts.  The indigenous in central and southern Mexico continued to produce written texts in the colonial period, many with pictorial elements.  An important scholarly reference work is the ''[[Handbook of Middle American Indians]], Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources''. [[Mesoamerican codices]] survive from the [[Aztec codices|Aztec]], [[Maya codices|Maya]], [[Mixtec codices|Mixtec]], and [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] regions.\n\n=== Arithmetic ===\n{{See also|Maya numerals}}\n\nMesoamerican [[arithmetic]] treated [[number]]s as having both literal and symbolic value, the result of the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] nature that characterized Mesoamerican ideology.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} As mentioned, the Mesoamerican numbering system was vigesimal (i.e., based on the number 20).\n\nIn representing numbers, a series of bars and dots were employed. Dots had a value of one, and bars had a value of five. This type of arithmetic was combined with a symbolic numerology: '2' was related to origins, as all origins can be thought of as doubling; '3' was related to household fire; '4' was linked to the four corners of the universe; '5' expressed instability; '9' pertained to the underworld and the night; '13' was the number for light, '20' for abundance, and '400' for infinity. The [[0 (number)|concept of zero]] was also used, and its representation at the Late Preclassic occupation of [[Tres Zapotes]] is one of the earliest uses of zero in human history.\n\n=== Food, medicine, and science ===\n{{cquote|Mesoamerica would deserve its place in the human [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] if its inhabitants had only created [[maize]], in terms of harvest weight the world's most important crop.

One writer estimated that Indians developed three-fifths of the crops now grown in cultivation, most of them in Mesoamerica. Having secured their food supply, the Mesoamerican societies turned to intellectual pursuits. In a millennium or less, a comparatively short time, they invented their own [[writing]], [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]], including the [[zero]].<ref>Mann, Charles C. 1491: Revelations of the Americas before Columbus.

Astral divinities (the sun, stars, constellations, and Venus) were adopted and represented in anthropomorphic, [[zoomorphic]], and anthropozoomorphic sculptures, and in day-to-day objects.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} The qualities of these gods and their attributes changed with the passage of time and with cultural influences from other Mesoamerican groups. The gods are at once three: creator, preserver, and destroyer, and at the same time just one. An important characteristic of Mesoamerican religion was the dualism among the divine entities. The gods represented the confrontation between opposite poles: the positive, exemplified by light, the masculine, force, war, the sun, etc.; and the negative, exemplified by darkness, the feminine, repose, peace, the moon, etc.\n\nThe typical Mesoamerican cosmology sees the world as separated into a day world watched by the sun and a night world watched by the moon. More importantly, the three superposed levels of the world are united by a [[Ceiba]] tree (''Yaxche''' in Mayan). The geographic vision is also tied to the cardinal points. Certain geographical features are linked to different parts of this cosmovision. Thus mountains and tall trees connect the middle and upper worlds; caves connect the middle and nether worlds.\n\n==== Sacrifice ====\nGenerally, sacrifice can be divided into two types: [[Bloodletting rituals in Maya culture|autosacrifice]] and [[human sacrifice]]. The different forms of sacrifice are reflected in the imagery used to evoke ideological structure and sociocultural organization in Mesoamerica. In the Maya area, for example, stele depict bloodletting rituals performed by ruling elites, eagles and jaguars devouring human hearts, jade circles or necklaces that represented hearts, and plants and flowers that symbolized both nature and the blood that provided life.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Imagery also showed pleas for rain or pleas for blood, with the same intention to replenish the divine energy. Ritual sacrifice was done in efforts to appease the gods, and was done with the purpose of protection of the population.\n\n===== Autosacrifice =====\n{{Main|Bloodletting in Mesoamerica}}\n{{See also|Sacrifice in Maya culture}}[[File:Human sacrifice (Codex Laud, f.8).png|thumb|Ritual human sacrifice portrayed in [[Codex Laud]]]]\n\nAutosacrifice, also called [[bloodletting]], is the ritualized practice of drawing blood from oneself. It is commonly seen or represented through iconography as performed by ruling elites in highly ritualized ceremonies, but it was easily practiced in mundane sociocultural contexts (i.e., non-elites could perform autosacrifice). The act was typically performed with [[obsidian]] [[prismatic blade]]s or [[Stingray injury#Biological structure of the barb|stingray spines]], and blood was drawn from piercing or cutting the [[tongue]], [[earlobe]]s, and/or [[genitals]] (among other locations). Another form of autosacrifice was conducted by pulling a rope with attached thorns through the tongue or earlobes. The blood produced was then collected on [[amate]] held in a bowl.\n\nAutosacrifice was not limited to male rulers, as their female counterparts often performed these ritualized activities. They are typically shown performing the rope and thorns technique. A recently discovered queen's tomb in the Classic Maya site of [[El Per\u00fa (Maya site)|Waka]] (also known as El Per\u00fa) had a ceremonial stingray spine placed in her genital area, suggesting that women also performed bloodletting in their genitalia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/05/040506073833.htm|title=Archaeologists Announce Discoveries At The Ancient Maya Site Of Waka' In Northern Guatemala|date=May 6, 2004|accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n===== Human sacrifice =====\n{{See also|Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|Human sacrifice in Maya culture}}\n\nSacrifice had great importance in the social and religious aspects of Mesoamerican culture. First, it showed death transformed into the divine.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Death is the consequence of a human sacrifice, but it is not the end; it is but the continuation of the cosmic cycle. Death creates life\u2014divine energy is liberated through death and returns to the gods, who are then able to create more life. Secondly, it justifies war, since the most valuable sacrifices are obtained through conflict. The death of the warrior is the greatest sacrifice and gives the gods the energy to go about their daily activities, such as the bringing of rain. Warfare and capturing prisoners became a method of social advancement and a religious cause. Finally, it justifies the control of power by the two ruling classes, the priests and the warriors. The priests controlled the religious ideology, and the warriors supplied the sacrifices. Historically it was also in discussion that those sacrificed were chosen by the gods, this idea of being \"chosen\" was decided by the gods. This was then displayed by acts, such as being struck by lightning. If someone was struck by lightning and a sacrifice was needed they would often be chosen by their population, as they believed they were chosen by the gods.\n\n==== Ballgame ====\n{{Main|Mesoamerican ballgame}}\n[[File:Uaxactunballcourt.jpg|thumb|A small ceremonial ballcourt at [[Uaxactun]].]]\n[[File:Ballgamemarker.jpg|thumb|[[Mesoamerican ballgame|Ballgame marker]] from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|classic]] [[Maya civilization|Lowland Maya]] site of [[Chinkultic]], [[Mexico]] depicting a ballplayer in full gear]]\n\nThe Mesoamerican ballgame was a sport with ritual associations played for over 3000 years by nearly all pre-Columbian peoples of Mesoamerica. The sport had different versions in different places during the millennia, and a modern version of the game, [[ulama (game)|ulama]], is still played in a few places.\n\nOver 1300 [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] have been found throughout Mesoamerica.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Taladoire|2001|p=98}} Note that slightly over 200 ballcourts have also been identified in the [[American Southwest]]. This total does not include those, since they are outside Mesoamerica, and there is discussion whether these areas were actually used for ballplaying.</ref> They vary considerably in size, but they all feature long narrow alleys with side-walls to bounce the balls against.\n\nThe rules of the ballgame are not known, but it was probably similar to volleyball, where the object is to keep the ball in play. In the most well-known version of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, though some versions used forearms or employed rackets, bats, or handstones. The ball was made of solid rubber, and weighed up to 4&nbsp;kg or more, with sizes that differed greatly over time or according to the version played.{{sfn|Filloy Nadal|2001|p=30}}{{sfn|Leyenaar|2001|pp=125\u201326}}\n\nWhile the game was played casually for simple recreation, including by children and perhaps even women, the game also had important ritual aspects, and major formal ballgames were held as ritual events, often featuring human sacrifice.\n\n==== Astronomy ====\nMesoamerican [[astronomy]] included a broad understanding of the cycles of planets and other celestial bodies. Special importance was given to the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[Venus]] as the morning and evening star.\n\nObservatories were built at some sites, including the round observatory at [[Seibal|Ceibal]] and the \u201cObservatorio\u201d at [[Xochicalco]]. Often, the architectural organization of Mesoamerican sites was based on precise calculations derived from astronomical observations. Well-known examples of these include the [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|El Castillo]] pyramid at Chichen Itza and the Observatorio at [[Xochicalco]]. A unique and common architectural complex found among many Mesoamerican sites are [[E-Group]]s, which are aligned so as to serve as astronomical observatories. The name of this complex is based on [[Uaxactun]]\u2019s \u201cGroup E,\u201d the first known observatory in the Maya area. Perhaps the earliest observatory documented in Mesoamerica is that of the [[Monte Alto culture]]. This complex consisted of three plain stelae and a temple oriented with respect to the [[Pleiades]].\n\n==== Symbolism of space and time ====\n[[File:Mexico0047.jpg|thumb|The [[Teotihuacan#Site layout|Avenue of the Dead]] in [[Teotihuacan]], an example of a Mesoamerican settlement planned according to concepts of directionality]]\n\nIt has been argued that among Mesoamerican societies the concepts of [[space]] and [[time]] are associated with the four [[cardinal points|cardinal compass points]] and linked together by the [[calendar]].<ref>Duverger 1999</ref> Dates or events were always tied to a compass direction, and the calendar specified the symbolic geographical characteristic peculiar to that period. Resulting from the significance held by the cardinal directions, many Mesoamerican architectural features, if not entire settlements, were planned and oriented with respect to directionality.\n\nIn Maya cosmology, each cardinal point was assigned a specific color and a specific jaguar deity ([[Maya mythology#Bacabs|Bacab]]). They are as follows:\n* '''[[Hacha-kyum|Hobnil]]''', Bacab of the [[East]], associated with the color red and the ''Kan'' years\n* '''[[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings#C|Can Tzicnal]]''', Bacab of the [[North]], assigned the color white and the ''Muluc'' years\n* '''[[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings#Z|Zac Cimi]]''', Bacab of the [[West]], associated with the color black and the ''Ix'' years\n* '''[[Hacha-kyum|Hozanek]]''', Bacab of the [[South]], associated with the color yellow and the ''Cauac'' years.\n\nLater cultures such as the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] and [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] maintain the association of cardinal directions with each color, but utilized different names.\n\nAmong the Aztec, the name of each day was associated with a cardinal point (thus conferring symbolic significance), and each cardinal direction was associated with a group of symbols. Below are the symbols and concepts associated with each direction:\n* '''East''': [[American crocodile|croco]] [[Morelet's crocodile|dile]], the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], [[water]], cane, and movement. The East was linked to the world priests and associated with vegetative fertility, or, in other words, tropical exuberance.\n* '''North''': wind, death, the dog, the jaguar, and [[flint]] (or [[chert]]). The north contrasts with the east in that it is conceptualized as dry, cold, and oppressive. It is considered the nocturnal part of the universe and includes the dwellings of the dead. The dog ([[xoloitzcuintle]]) has a very specific meaning, as it accompanies the deceased during the trip to the lands of the dead and helps them cross the river of death that leads into nothingness. (''See also'' [[Dogs in Mesoamerican folklore and myth]]).\n* '''West''': the house, the deer, the [[New World monkey|monkey]], the [[eagle]], and rain. The west was associated with the cycles of vegetation, specifically the temperate high plains that experience light rains and the change of seasons.\n* '''South''': rabbit, the [[lizard]], dried herbs, the [[New World vulture|buzzard]], and flowers. It is related on the one hand to the luminous Sun and the noon heat, and on the other with rain filled with alcoholic drink. The rabbit, the principal symbol of the west, was associated with farmers and with [[pulque]].\n\n=== Political and religious art ===\n{{Category see also|Mesoamerican art}}\n[[File:Tzompantli Tovar.jpeg|thumb|Art with ideological and political meaning: depiction of an [[Aztec]] ''[[tzompantli]]'' (skull-rack) from the [[Ramirez Codex]]]]\n\nMesoamerican [[art]]istic expression was conditioned by [[ideology]] and generally focused on themes of [[religion]] and/or sociopolitical [[Power (sociology)|power]]. This is largely based on the fact that most works that survived the Spanish conquest were public monuments. These monuments were typically erected by rulers who sought to visually legitimize their sociocultural and political position; by doing so, they intertwined their lineage, personal attributes and achievements, and legacy with religious concepts. As such, these monuments were specifically designed for public display and took many forms, including [[stele]], [[sculpture]], architectural [[relief]]s, and other types of architectural elements (e.g., roofcombs). Other themes expressed include tracking time, glorifying the city, and veneration of the gods\u2014all of which were tied to explicitly aggrandizing the abilities and the reign of the ruler who commissioned the artwork.\n\nThe majority are artwork created during this historical time was in relation to these topics, religion and politics. Rulers were drawn and sculpted. Historical tales and events were then translated into pieces of art, and art was used to relay religious and political messages.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{main|Maya music}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mesoamerica|Geography|Latin America}}\n<!-- {{Wikipedia-Books}} -->\n<!-- {{Main|Outline of Mesoamerica|Index of Mesoamerica-related articles}} -->\n<!-- *[[Bibliography of Mesoamerica]] -->\n*[[Americas (terminology)]]\n*[[Americas]]\n*[[Central America]]\n*[[Hispanic America]]\n*[[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]\n*[[Indigenous peoples of Mexico]]\n*[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n*[[Latin America]]\n*[[Mesoamerican region]]\n*[[Middle America (Americas)]]\n*[[Painting in the Americas before European colonization]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n{{Reflist}}\n{{div col end|2}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite book |title=Cambridge History of the Native peoples of The Americas |volume=2: Mesoamerica |editor1-first=Richard E.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n\nRead The books and you'll find out who its produced by.\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure volumes}}\n\nWritten and illustrated by [[Hirohiko Araki]], ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' began serialization in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' in its combined issue #1\u20132 of 1987, which was published on January 1, 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mediaarts-db.jp/mg/magazine_works/1292 |script-title=ja:\u9031\u520a\u5c11\u5e74\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u3000\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u306e\u5947\u5999\u306a\u5192\u967a(\u8352\u6728\u98db\u5442\u5f66) |website=Media Arts Database |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |language=Japanese |accessdate=July 16, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913191033/http://mediaarts-db.jp/mg/magazine_works/1292 |archivedate=September 13, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The chapters are collected and published into ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by [[Shueisha]], with the first released on August 10, 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-851126-3|title=\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u306e\u5947\u5999\u306a\u5192\u967a 1|trans-title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Volume 1|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|accessdate=August 17, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915175258/http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=4-08-851126-3|archivedate=September 15, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The series is broken into arcs or parts, each of which stars a different descendant of the Joestar family.

The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation.

[[Earl Scruggs]] often ended a song with this [[phrase (music)|phrase]] or a variation of it. On the television show ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', musical cues signifying the coming of a commercial break (cues which were in bluegrass style) frequently ended with \"Shave and a Haircut\".

It was also used as an ending to many cartoon shows, just after the credits. Decades later, the couplet became a plot device to lure-out an intended victim, as used by the chief antagonist [[List of Who Framed Roger Rabbit characters#Judge Doom|Judge Doom]] in the film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', the idea being that [[Cartoon|Toon]]s cannot resist finishing with the \"two bits\" when they hear the opening rhythm.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096438/quotes?qt=qt0406091 |title = Quotes from \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"}}</ref>\n\nThe phrase has been incorporated into countless recordings and performances.

''Halv tolv'' thus means ''half twelve'' and is the correct Swedish equivalent of half past eleven.

This generation took several design cues from the \"HCD-II Epoch\" concept that debuted at the 1993 Detroit Auto Show.

In the UK, Hyundai's entrance into the Formula 2 [[World Rally Championship]] saw the release of the \"F2\" and \"F2 Evolution\" models in 1998 and 1999 respectively.\n\n[[File:Hyundai Coupe F2 1998.jpg|thumb|left|Hyundai Coupe F2 (1998\u20131999, UK)]]The \"F2\" (non Evolution) was released in July 1998. Only available in the UK, the \"F2\" model sold approximately 1100 units in total during 1998 and 1999, (making the \"F2\" a slightly rarer model than the \"F2 Evolution\" which followed). An enhanced version of the UK-spec 2.0 SE, the \"F2\" was available in a choice of three colours; Black (solid), Bright Silver (metallic), or Racing Blue (mica). (This latter colour, a vivid bright blue, was unique to the \"F2\"; no other Hyundai models were ever made available in Racing Blue (mica)). The \"F2\" modifications included 16\" diameter x 7.5J multi-spoke DTM-style alloy wheels. These wheels were fitted with carbon-fibre effect centre-caps incorporating the \"F2\" logo within. According to Hyundai's \"Coupe F2 Tyre Supplement Handbook\", (supplied with each new Coupe F2), these wheels were described as \"Motorsport-style alloy wheels\". The wheels were actually [http://www.teamdynamicsracing.com/whoaretd.htm Team Dynamics] DTM, which were manufactured in England by [http://www.rimstock.co.uk]. These wheels were high-quality for an OEM alloy wheel, weighing only 17.6&nbsp;lbs (8.0&nbsp;kg) per corner and closely emulating the style of the [http://www.tsw.com TSW] Hockenheim R.\n\nTyres were [[Pirelli]] 225/40/16 P7000 directional, their 225 width and 40 profile made these the most aggressive standard-fit tyre supplied with any RD (or RD2) Hyundai Coupe. The \"F2\" also featured a deeper and more aggressive front spoiler, incorporating an oval chrome mesh grille insert. There was also \"F2\" badging on the front wings and rear valance, an uprated CD/tuner stereo by Sony (CDX C5000R with RDS), \"Coupe F2\" monogrammed aluminium kick plates, a unique leather-and-aluminium gearstick and a discreet \"Coupe F2\" badge on the ashtray fascia. The front carpet mats were inlaid with rectangular silver-coloured \"Coupe F2\" badges. According to the Hyundai Coupe F2 brochure, total on-the-road price was \u00a317,999 (as of July 1998).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyundaicoupe.info/models/index.html?page=hcsef2&pix=pix_f2&&menu=m_models_1996 |title=Coupe Models \u2013 The UK Hyundai Coupe Site |publisher=Hyundaicoupe.info |date=19 July 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwo further items were available free to the first five-hundred Hyundai Coupe F2 buyers. Firstly, there was a large aluminium-bound \"F2\" art book, (including various artistic photographs and designer images of the Coupe F2). These books were signed inside by rally driver Kenneth Eriksson, (one of Hyundai's drivers in the F2 World Rally Championship at the time). Secondly, there was an aluminium key-fob, fitted with an LED light and supplied in a small silver-coloured box labelled \"Lexon Design Concept\". Both of these items were packaged together in a large silver cardboard box with \"F2\" printed onto the lid. These items were supplied by the dealer upon collection of the new car. During 1998, there was prominent press and billboard advertising in the UK to promote the new \"Coupe F2\". These advertisements incorporated the tag-line, \"On average, men think about the F2 every 6 seconds.\"\n\n[[File:Hyundai Coupe F2 Evolution.jpg|thumb|left|Hyundai Coupe F2 Evolution (UK)]]The \"F2 Evolution\" became available on 14 June 1999, almost one-year after the \"F2\" had appeared. The \"F2\" was discontinued and the new \"F2 Evolution\" effectively replaced it. The \"F2 Evolution\" was available with just two colour options, either Silver (metallic) or Cobalt Blue (metallic). It was intended as a limited edition of 1500 units, (though 1513 units were eventually produced). The design was led by [[McLaren F1]] stylist [[Peter Stevens (car designer)|Peter Stevens]] in conjunction with [[Hyundai World Rally Team#Motorsport|Hyundai World Rally Team's]] support company Motor Sports Developments (MSD).\n\nStandard 2.0 SE Coupes were delivered to MSD for mechanical and cosmetic modification. These modifications included a bigger front bumper/spoiler, a modified (larger and higher) rear spoiler with end-plates (these spoilers were designed by Stevens to create zero lift rather than ultimate downforce), a high-lift inlet [[camshaft]] (taken from the 1997 1.8-litre Lantra engine) and a 6\"x4\" freeflow exhaust by Magnex (suppliers to [[Aston Martin]]). Wheels were 16\" diameter x 7.0J 5-spoke alloys manufactured by [http://www.tsw.com TSW] (with [[Yokohama Rubber Company|Yokohama]] 205/45/16 tyres).  There were \"F2 Evolution\" badges on the front wings and rear valance. Vehicle security was provided by a Thatcham-approved Category 1 alarm/immobiliser system. Inside, there was an uprated Sony stereo, \"Coupe F2 Evolution\" monogrammed aluminium kick plates, thicker lambswool carpets and cream instrument dials incorporating \"F2 Evolution\" logos. The front carpet mats were inlaid with silver-coloured circular \"Coupe F2 Evolution\" badges. The armrest lid between the front seats was covered in stitched leather (rather than the molded plastic found on lesser models). The gear leaver gaiter was of smooth leather, with a chrome trim surround at the base, manufactured by [http://www.richbrook.co.uk Richbrook]. The gear-knob was of a unique design and had a chrome finish. Additionally, new brake pads were co-developed for the F2 Evolution by MSD and [http://www.apracing.com AP Racing], these new pads provided better \"bite\" and improved fade resistance.\n\nThe mechanical changes were limited to the camshaft and exhaust improvements. Together these modifications saw an increase in power to {{Convert|154|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and torque to {{convert|140|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newtonnet.co.uk/coupe/ |title=Hyundai Coupe F2 Evolution |publisher=Newtonnet.co.uk |accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nEach car was supplied with a metal MSD badge. This was fitted onto the bulkhead inside the engine bay. This badge displayed the MSD build number of each particular conversion to \"F2 Evolution\" spec.\n\nUnlike with the previous year's \"F2\" model, this time no dealer-supplied art-book was supplied. However, a range of \"F2 Evolution\" lifestyle accessories were made available through Hyundai dealerships, such as \"F2 Evolution\" branded pens, chairs, clothing and umbrellas etc.\n\nAccording to Hyundai's product-launch literature, total on-the-road price for the \"F2 Evolution\" was \u00a319,299 (as of June 1999).\n\n===RD2 (1999\u20132001)===\n[[File:2000-2001 Hyundai Tiburon.jpg|thumb|right|Hyundai Tiburon (RD2)]]\n[[File:1998 Hyundai Coupe (RD) FX coupe (2015-08-07) 02.jpg|thumb|right|Hyundai Coupe (RD)]]\n[[File:1999 Hyundai Coupe (RD) SX coupe (2015-08-07) 02.jpg|thumb|right|Hyundai Coupe (RD2)]]\n\nThe RD2 Tiburon is an update on the original RD platform and was released for sale in 1999. The RD2 received a facelift that altered the front and rear bumpers and also provided a refreshed interior dash. In South Korea, the RD2 Tiburon was marketed as the \"Tiburon Turbulence\".\n\nThe RD2 headlights have separate enclosures for the high and low beams giving the four headlight look, similar to [[Acura Integra#Third generation .281994.E2.80.932001.29|the third generation Honda/Acura Integra]] and [[Toyota Celica#Sixth generation .2F T200 Series .281993.E2.80.931999.29|the sixth generation Toyota Celica]].

Hyundai launched a revised Tiburon in 2002 for the 2003 model year, giving it new styling, larger dimensions, and an optional [[V6 engine]]. Tiburon's wheelbase and overall length grew slightly compared to the previous version, increasing curb weight by about {{convert|200|lb||abbr=on}}. In the US, base and GT V6 models were offered with standard front side airbags and optional anti-lock brakes. Base Tiburons retained the {{Convert|138|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while GT V6 coupes got the new 2.7-liter {{Convert|172|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V6 from Hyundai's [[Hyundai Sonata|Sonata]] and [[Hyundai Santa Fe|Santa Fe]]. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, and a four-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] was optional. The automatic unit had a manual shift gate. Also optional on the GT V6 was a six-speed manual gearbox. Base models and GT V6 automatics rode on 16-inch tires, versus 17-inch for the GT V6 manual models. '''Tuscani''' models had all the upgrades being the \"Elite\" model with separate badging to set it apart from all other models. Both had standard four-wheel disc brakes. Leather upholstery was standard in the GT V6, as well as a rear spoiler (high spoiler std. on 6-speed only). Aluminium pedals and a sunroof were optional.\n\nIn 2004, all GT V6s received 17\" wheels.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} A \"special edition\" of the GT V6 was also released. It featured a \"Special Edition\" decal-style badge underneath \"Tiburon\", sport cloth upholstery, a [[Kenwood Corporation|Kenwood]] stereo, red painted front brake calipers, and multigauges above the radio. Only the 6-speed and automatic transmissions were available. The special edition was available in Jet Black, Rally Red, and Sunburst Yellow only. The new design received praise from a number of automotive journalists, some of which compared it to the [[Ferrari 456]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/carreviews/firstdrives/19541/hyundai_coupe.html |title=Hyundai Coupe &#124; First Drives &#124; Car Reviews |magazine=Auto Express |date=1 March 2002 |accessdate=8 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2004 Hyundai Coupe S 1.6 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|2004 Hyundai Coup\u00e9 (GK)]]\n\nIn 2005 Hyundai facelifted the Tiburon and reshuffled the model lineup; offering GS, GT, and SE models. The SE was now a separate trim from the GT models. Hyundai's four-cylinder engine went into the GS, while the other two held the 2.7-liter V6.  A five-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard. A four-speed automatic with a manual shift was optional for GS and GT models, but the SE had exclusive use of a six-speed manual gearbox. Anti-lock brakes was standard on the SE and optional for the GT coupe, which could be equipped with leather upholstery. GS coupes rode on 16-inch wheels, versus 17-inch for other models. All-disc brakes and front side airbags were standard. Anti-lock brakes were made standard on all 2006 model Tiburons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2003-to-2008-hyundai-tiburon.htm |title=2003\u20132008 Hyundai Tiburon: Overview, Updated: 11/13/10, Consumer Guide Automotive |accessdate=17 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623064720/http://consumerguideauto.howstuffworks.com/2003-to-2008-hyundai-tiburon.htm |archivedate=23 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the UK, three models were available before and after the 2005 facelift: the 1.6S, 2.0SE and V6. The 1.6S had a single exhaust and leather seats were optional, although following the 2005 facelift half-leather seats were standard. Both other models have twin exhausts and leather seats as standard. The six-speed gearbox was also standard on the V6 model.\n\nA popular modification saw owners of the first GK model removing the air-filter resonator box.  The resonator box was located directly in front of the front left hand side wheel, behind the fender.  This allowed for a greater airflow to the air filter, gaining a minimal increase of [[brake horsepower]] (bhp).  Hyundai, seeking cost cuts, adopted this modification for 2004+ models. Hyundai also released a new color for their 2006 Tiburon called Regatta blue, between Tidal Wave blue and Midnight blue, which is Metallic. This color is also available for the 2007 Elantra and Tiburon.\n\nIn Greece and perhaps other countries, due to high taxation in hi-displacement engines, a 1.6-liter Turbocharged engine was available for some years, producing 145 PS(107&nbsp;kW) at 5,800&nbsp;rpm and 190 Nm (128&nbsp;lbf) of torque at 4,300&nbsp;rpm and making the 1233&nbsp;kg vehicle capable of accelerating from 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0\u201362&nbsp;mph) in 9.3 seconds and achieving a top speed of 210&nbsp;km/h (131&nbsp;mph). Fuel consumption was 6.4L/100&nbsp;km (36.8 mpg).\n\n===GK F/L (2005\u20132006)===\n{{Multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 2006 Hyundai Tiburon.jpg\n| image2 = Hyundai Coup\u00e9 (GK) Facelift rear 20100923.jpg\n| caption2 = 2005 Hyundai Tiburon/Coup\u00e9\n}}\nHyundai conducted minor tweaks to the 'GK' model in 2005, for the outgoing named 2006. The vehicle incorporated reworked sleeker blackened \"smoked\" headlights, redesigned rear tail lights, more aggressive front air dam, a different range of alloy wheel designs, colored stitching on leather seats (half leather seats available for the 1.6 range).\nIn 2006, Hyundai released the GT Limited Model. This was an upgrade from the GT V6. It included an upgraded tan leather interior, automatic climate controls, a 440w Infinity 6-disc in [[head unit|dash stereo]] with 10\" [[subwoofer]], an upgraded gauge cluster, and side markers. The GT LTD came in black, Blue, and midnight blue.\n\n===TS (2005\u20132006) Australian limited editions===\n\nIn Australia, a limited edition TS was released in October 2005. It had a unique \"tiger orange\" color paintjob (a color that was not available for any other model) and an extra high rear spoiler. Black leather trim with red stitching, sunroof and other extras were included as standard. The name TS stands for \"Tiger Shark\", referring to its exclusive orange color and the shark origins of the Tiburon name.\n\nOnly 80 of these 2005 TS models were released. Each had an individually numbered ID plate inside the driver's door frame. Number 1 had a manual transmission, and number 80 had an automatic transmission.\n\nA limited edition TS of the 2006 model was also released in 2006. It was available in a unique \"vivid blue\" paintjob. Only 62 of these were released.\n\n===GK F/L2 (2007\u20132008)===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 220\n| image1 = 2007-2008 Hyundai Tiburon -- 05-02-2012 2.JPG\n| image2 = 2009 Hyundai Coupe Siii Automatic 2.0 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = 2007\u20132008 Hyundai Tiburon/Coup\u00e9\n}}\n\nA more comprehensive facelift was launched in 2007, named the Coupe SIII in markets such as the UK, this time altering the appearance of the car enough to designate it the fourth generation or GK F/L2 reminiscent of the RD1 and RD2 denotations.\n\nThe headlights are thinner and angled more aggressively; somewhat similar to the original Tiburon headlights with more straight/sharp lines. The tail lights are similar to the RD2 and GK1 but are somewhat smaller and reflect an aftermarket styling. The fenders lose the \"gill fins\" and other small changes are seen.\n\nThe interior is updated with brushed aluminium accents, new blue backlight scheme for gauges and instrumentation and new seats.\n\nHyundai later introduced the limited, special edition TSIII (UK). This upgraded, limited edition included quilted leather interior with embroidered logos, stiffer sports suspension, quad exhaust exit pipes, a higher level rear spoiler and an anthracite finish to the alloy wheels. The performance of the TSIII remained the same as the SIII.

The Tuscani wears a circular badge containing a smaller circle of black and grey horizontal bars which is overlaid with a letter 'T' painted gold on the left and silver on the right. Even in markets where the car is sold as a Hyundai Tiburon or Hyundai Coupe, the name Tuscani has become quite popular. Many cars have been modified aftermarket to be rebadged with Tuscani emblems. In Canada, a special edition of the Tiburon is sold as a \"Tuscani edition\".  There was a rumour that Hyundai is considering a plan to branch off the Tuscani name as a complete sub brand for more exclusive, sporty, and upmarket models. The existence of the name is most likely to achieve greater sales where the Hyundai name has cloying associations with more budget products.\n\nIn some markets secondary badging may denote engine size and variations such as trim, wheel, and other options. These badges include GS, GT, SE and FX, although some use FX across the entire range available. In certain markets, certain exterior colors are not available and identification may require noticing subtle local differences such as alloy wheels, spoilers or dealer fit options such as in car entertainment systems. These can all change from year to year and from market to market, so the variation is quite significant. One notable difference is that the 1.6 engine always has a single exhaust on the right hand side, in all markets where it is sold.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hyundai Genesis Coupe]], a Rear Wheel Drive Hyundai sports car\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category multi|Hyundai Tiburon|Hyundai Coup\u00e9|Hyundai Tuscani}}\n\n{{Hyundai cars}}\n{{Hyundai North America}}\n{{Hyundai Motor Company}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[Category:Hyundai vehicles|Tiburon]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive sports cars]]\n[[Category:Sport compact cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1996]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Rally cars]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Hyundai Tiburon\n| image        = 2005\u20132007 Hyundai Tiburon (GK) V6 coupe.jpg\n| manufacturer = [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]]\n| aka          = Hyundai Coup\u00e9\n| production   = 1996\u20132008\n| class        = [[Sports car]]\n| body_style   = 2-door [[Coup\u00e9|coupe]]\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|FF layout]]\n| predecessor  = [[Hyundai Scoupe]]\n| successor    = [[Hyundai Veloster]]\n}}\nThe '''Hyundai Tiburon''' ({{lang-ko|\ud604\ub300 \ud2f0\ubdf0\ub860}}) known as the '''Hyundai Coup\u00e9''' (\ud604\ub300 \ucfe0\ud398) in the European Market is a [[sports car|sports]] [[Coup\u00e9|coupe]] that was produced by the South Korean manufacturer [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]] from 1996 to 2008.\n\nThe name \"Tiburon\", a slight variation of \"tibur\u00f3n\", the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for \"[[shark]]\", is the name given to the North American, Australian, [[New Zealand]], South African, and [[Austria]]n production of the vehicle.

It was available in a few foreign markets with engine choices of either 1.6L or 1.8L. In the United States, the Tiburon was first offered in 1997 with base models using the Elantra's 1.8L {{Convert|130|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine while the upscale FX received a 2.0L [[Straight-4|four-cylinder engine]]. The 2.0L was rated at {{Convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at the crankshaft (the car's manual specifies {{Convert|102|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} at the flywheel). Base weight was around 2,550&nbsp;lb (1,150&nbsp;kg), giving the RD Tiburon a higher power-to-weight ratio than the newer GK 2.0L.

In 1998 the Tiburon lost its weaker 1.8L engine, giving both models the 2.0L. All versions of the Tiburon manufactured from 1996 to 2002 are known as \"RD\" Tiburons.

There were various options, with or without ABS, 2 [[airbags]], leather, and [[sunroof]].\n\n===RD Special Editions (UK) \u2013 F2 and F2 Evolution===\nVarious special editions were also produced, focusing primarily on cosmetic modifications and improvements. In the UK, Hyundai's entrance into the Formula 2 [[World Rally Championship]] saw the release of the \"F2\" and \"F2 Evolution\" models in 1998 and 1999 respectively.\n\n[[File:Hyundai Coupe F2 1998.jpg|thumb|left|Hyundai Coupe F2 (1998\u20131999, UK)]]The \"F2\" (non Evolution) was released in July 1998. Only available in the UK, the \"F2\" model sold approximately 1100 units in total during 1998 and 1999, (making the \"F2\" a slightly rarer model than the \"F2 Evolution\" which followed). An enhanced version of the UK-spec 2.0 SE, the \"F2\" was available in a choice of three colours; Black (solid), Bright Silver (metallic), or Racing Blue (mica). (This latter colour, a vivid bright blue, was unique to the \"F2\"; no other Hyundai models were ever made available in Racing Blue (mica)). The \"F2\" modifications included 16\" diameter x 7.5J multi-spoke DTM-style alloy wheels. These wheels were fitted with carbon-fibre effect centre-caps incorporating the \"F2\" logo within. According to Hyundai's \"Coupe F2 Tyre Supplement Handbook\", (supplied with each new Coupe F2), these wheels were described as \"Motorsport-style alloy wheels\". The wheels were actually [http://www.teamdynamicsracing.com/whoaretd.htm Team Dynamics] DTM, which were manufactured in England by [http://www.rimstock.co.uk]. These wheels were high-quality for an OEM alloy wheel, weighing only 17.6&nbsp;lbs (8.0&nbsp;kg) per corner and closely emulating the style of the [http://www.tsw.com TSW] Hockenheim R.\n\nTyres were [[Pirelli]] 225/40/16 P7000 directional, their 225 width and 40 profile made these the most aggressive standard-fit tyre supplied with any RD (or RD2) Hyundai Coupe. The \"F2\" also featured a deeper and more aggressive front spoiler, incorporating an oval chrome mesh grille insert. There was also \"F2\" badging on the front wings and rear valance, an uprated CD/tuner stereo by Sony (CDX C5000R with RDS), \"Coupe F2\" monogrammed aluminium kick plates, a unique leather-and-aluminium gearstick and a discreet \"Coupe F2\" badge on the ashtray fascia. The front carpet mats were inlaid with rectangular silver-coloured \"Coupe F2\" badges. According to the Hyundai Coupe F2 brochure, total on-the-road price was \u00a317,999 (as of July 1998).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyundaicoupe.info/models/index.html?page=hcsef2&pix=pix_f2&&menu=m_models_1996 |title=Coupe Models \u2013 The UK Hyundai Coupe Site |publisher=Hyundaicoupe.info |date=19 July 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwo further items were available free to the first five-hundred Hyundai Coupe F2 buyers. Firstly, there was a large aluminium-bound \"F2\" art book, (including various artistic photographs and designer images of the Coupe F2). These books were signed inside by rally driver Kenneth Eriksson, (one of Hyundai's drivers in the F2 World Rally Championship at the time). Secondly, there was an aluminium key-fob, fitted with an LED light and supplied in a small silver-coloured box labelled \"Lexon Design Concept\". Both of these items were packaged together in a large silver cardboard box with \"F2\" printed onto the lid. These items were supplied by the dealer upon collection of the new car. During 1998, there was prominent press and billboard advertising in the UK to promote the new \"Coupe F2\". These advertisements incorporated the tag-line, \"On average, men think about the F2 every 6 seconds.\"\n\n[[File:Hyundai Coupe F2 Evolution.jpg|thumb|left|Hyundai Coupe F2 Evolution (UK)]]The \"F2 Evolution\" became available on 14 June 1999, almost one-year after the \"F2\" had appeared. The \"F2\" was discontinued and the new \"F2 Evolution\" effectively replaced it. The \"F2 Evolution\" was available with just two colour options, either Silver (metallic) or Cobalt Blue (metallic). It was intended as a limited edition of 1500 units, (though 1513 units were eventually produced). The design was led by [[McLaren F1]] stylist [[Peter Stevens (car designer)|Peter Stevens]] in conjunction with [[Hyundai World Rally Team#Motorsport|Hyundai World Rally Team's]] support company Motor Sports Developments (MSD).\n\nStandard 2.0 SE Coupes were delivered to MSD for mechanical and cosmetic modification. These modifications included a bigger front bumper/spoiler, a modified (larger and higher) rear spoiler with end-plates (these spoilers were designed by Stevens to create zero lift rather than ultimate downforce), a high-lift inlet [[camshaft]] (taken from the 1997 1.8-litre Lantra engine) and a 6\"x4\" freeflow exhaust by Magnex (suppliers to [[Aston Martin]]). Wheels were 16\" diameter x 7.0J 5-spoke alloys manufactured by [http://www.tsw.com TSW] (with [[Yokohama Rubber Company|Yokohama]] 205/45/16 tyres).  There were \"F2 Evolution\" badges on the front wings and rear valance. Vehicle security was provided by a Thatcham-approved Category 1 alarm/immobiliser system. Inside, there was an uprated Sony stereo, \"Coupe F2 Evolution\" monogrammed aluminium kick plates, thicker lambswool carpets and cream instrument dials incorporating \"F2 Evolution\" logos. The front carpet mats were inlaid with silver-coloured circular \"Coupe F2 Evolution\" badges. The armrest lid between the front seats was covered in stitched leather (rather than the molded plastic found on lesser models). The gear leaver gaiter was of smooth leather, with a chrome trim surround at the base, manufactured by [http://www.richbrook.co.uk Richbrook]. The gear-knob was of a unique design and had a chrome finish. Additionally, new brake pads were co-developed for the F2 Evolution by MSD and [http://www.apracing.com AP Racing], these new pads provided better \"bite\" and improved fade resistance.\n\nThe mechanical changes were limited to the camshaft and exhaust improvements. Together these modifications saw an increase in power to {{Convert|154|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and torque to {{convert|140|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newtonnet.co.uk/coupe/ |title=Hyundai Coupe F2 Evolution |publisher=Newtonnet.co.uk |accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nEach car was supplied with a metal MSD badge. This was fitted onto the bulkhead inside the engine bay. This badge displayed the MSD build number of each particular conversion to \"F2 Evolution\" spec.\n\nUnlike with the previous year's \"F2\" model, this time no dealer-supplied art-book was supplied. However, a range of \"F2 Evolution\" lifestyle accessories were made available through Hyundai dealerships, such as \"F2 Evolution\" branded pens, chairs, clothing and umbrellas etc.\n\nAccording to Hyundai's product-launch literature, total on-the-road price for the \"F2 Evolution\" was \u00a319,299 (as of June 1999).\n\n===RD2 (1999\u20132001)===\n[[File:2000-2001 Hyundai Tiburon.jpg|thumb|right|Hyundai Tiburon (RD2)]]\n[[File:1998 Hyundai Coupe (RD) FX coupe (2015-08-07) 02.jpg|thumb|right|Hyundai Coupe (RD)]]\n[[File:1999 Hyundai Coupe (RD) SX coupe (2015-08-07) 02.jpg|thumb|right|Hyundai Coupe (RD2)]]\n\nThe RD2 Tiburon is an update on the original RD platform and was released for sale in 1999. The RD2 received a facelift that altered the front and rear bumpers and also provided a refreshed interior dash. In South Korea, the RD2 Tiburon was marketed as the \"Tiburon Turbulence\".\n\nThe RD2 headlights have separate enclosures for the high and low beams giving the four headlight look, similar to [[Acura Integra#Third generation .281994.E2.80.932001.29|the third generation Honda/Acura Integra]] and [[Toyota Celica#Sixth generation .2F T200 Series .281993.E2.80.931999.29|the sixth generation Toyota Celica]].

Hyundai launched a revised Tiburon in 2002 for the 2003 model year, giving it new styling, larger dimensions, and an optional [[V6 engine]]. Tiburon's wheelbase and overall length grew slightly compared to the previous version, increasing curb weight by about {{convert|200|lb||abbr=on}}. In the US, base and GT V6 models were offered with standard front side airbags and optional anti-lock brakes. Base Tiburons retained the {{Convert|138|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine, while GT V6 coupes got the new 2.7-liter {{Convert|172|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V6 from Hyundai's [[Hyundai Sonata|Sonata]] and [[Hyundai Santa Fe|Santa Fe]]. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, and a four-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] was optional. The automatic unit had a manual shift gate. Also optional on the GT V6 was a six-speed manual gearbox. Base models and GT V6 automatics rode on 16-inch tires, versus 17-inch for the GT V6 manual models. '''Tuscani''' models had all the upgrades being the \"Elite\" model with separate badging to set it apart from all other models. Both had standard four-wheel disc brakes. Leather upholstery was standard in the GT V6, as well as a rear spoiler (high spoiler std. on 6-speed only). Aluminium pedals and a sunroof were optional.\n\nIn 2004, all GT V6s received 17\" wheels.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} A \"special edition\" of the GT V6 was also released. It featured a \"Special Edition\" decal-style badge underneath \"Tiburon\", sport cloth upholstery, a [[Kenwood Corporation|Kenwood]] stereo, red painted front brake calipers, and multigauges above the radio. Only the 6-speed and automatic transmissions were available. The special edition was available in Jet Black, Rally Red, and Sunburst Yellow only. The new design received praise from a number of automotive journalists, some of which compared it to the [[Ferrari 456]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/carreviews/firstdrives/19541/hyundai_coupe.html |title=Hyundai Coupe &#124; First Drives &#124; Car Reviews |magazine=Auto Express |date=1 March 2002 |accessdate=8 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2004 Hyundai Coupe S 1.6 Rear.jpg|thumb|left|2004 Hyundai Coup\u00e9 (GK)]]\n\nIn 2005 Hyundai facelifted the Tiburon and reshuffled the model lineup; offering GS, GT, and SE models. The SE was now a separate trim from the GT models. Hyundai's four-cylinder engine went into the GS, while the other two held the 2.7-liter V6.  A five-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard. A four-speed automatic with a manual shift was optional for GS and GT models, but the SE had exclusive use of a six-speed manual gearbox. Anti-lock brakes was standard on the SE and optional for the GT coupe, which could be equipped with leather upholstery. GS coupes rode on 16-inch wheels, versus 17-inch for other models. All-disc brakes and front side airbags were standard.

The 1.6S had a single exhaust and leather seats were optional, although following the 2005 facelift half-leather seats were standard. Both other models have twin exhausts and leather seats as standard. The six-speed gearbox was also standard on the V6 model.\n\nA popular modification saw owners of the first GK model removing the air-filter resonator box.  The resonator box was located directly in front of the front left hand side wheel, behind the fender.  This allowed for a greater airflow to the air filter, gaining a minimal increase of [[brake horsepower]] (bhp).  Hyundai, seeking cost cuts, adopted this modification for 2004+ models. Hyundai also released a new color for their 2006 Tiburon called Regatta blue, between Tidal Wave blue and Midnight blue, which is Metallic. This color is also available for the 2007 Elantra and Tiburon.\n\nIn Greece and perhaps other countries, due to high taxation in hi-displacement engines, a 1.6-liter Turbocharged engine was available for some years, producing 145 PS(107&nbsp;kW) at 5,800&nbsp;rpm and 190 Nm (128&nbsp;lbf) of torque at 4,300&nbsp;rpm and making the 1233&nbsp;kg vehicle capable of accelerating from 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0\u201362&nbsp;mph) in 9.3 seconds and achieving a top speed of 210&nbsp;km/h (131&nbsp;mph).

The vehicle incorporated reworked sleeker blackened \"smoked\" headlights, redesigned rear tail lights, more aggressive front air dam, a different range of alloy wheel designs, colored stitching on leather seats (half leather seats available for the 1.6 range).\nIn 2006, Hyundai released the GT Limited Model. This was an upgrade from the GT V6. It included an upgraded tan leather interior, automatic climate controls, a 440w Infinity 6-disc in [[head unit|dash stereo]] with 10\" [[subwoofer]], an upgraded gauge cluster, and side markers. The GT LTD came in black, Blue, and midnight blue.\n\n===TS (2005\u20132006) Australian limited editions===\n\nIn Australia, a limited edition TS was released in October 2005. It had a unique \"tiger orange\" color paintjob (a color that was not available for any other model) and an extra high rear spoiler. Black leather trim with red stitching, sunroof and other extras were included as standard. The name TS stands for \"Tiger Shark\", referring to its exclusive orange color and the shark origins of the Tiburon name.\n\nOnly 80 of these 2005 TS models were released. Each had an individually numbered ID plate inside the driver's door frame.

The tail lights are similar to the RD2 and GK1 but are somewhat smaller and reflect an aftermarket styling. The fenders lose the \"gill fins\" and other small changes are seen.\n\nThe interior is updated with brushed aluminium accents, new blue backlight scheme for gauges and instrumentation and new seats.\n\nHyundai later introduced the limited, special edition TSIII (UK). This upgraded, limited edition included quilted leather interior with embroidered logos, stiffer sports suspension, quad exhaust exit pipes, a higher level rear spoiler and an anthracite finish to the alloy wheels.

The Tuscani wears a circular badge containing a smaller circle of black and grey horizontal bars which is overlaid with a letter 'T' painted gold on the left and silver on the right. Even in markets where the car is sold as a Hyundai Tiburon or Hyundai Coupe, the name Tuscani has become quite popular. Many cars have been modified aftermarket to be rebadged with Tuscani emblems. In Canada, a special edition of the Tiburon is sold as a \"Tuscani edition\".  There was a rumour that Hyundai is considering a plan to branch off the Tuscani name as a complete sub brand for more exclusive, sporty, and upmarket models. The existence of the name is most likely to achieve greater sales where the Hyundai name has cloying associations with more budget products.\n\nIn some markets secondary badging may denote engine size and variations such as trim, wheel, and other options. These badges include GS, GT, SE and FX, although some use FX across the entire range available. In certain markets, certain exterior colors are not available and identification may require noticing subtle local differences such as alloy wheels, spoilers or dealer fit options such as in car entertainment systems. These can all change from year to year and from market to market, so the variation is quite significant. One notable difference is that the 1.6 engine always has a single exhaust on the right hand side, in all markets where it is sold.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hyundai Genesis Coupe]], a Rear Wheel Drive Hyundai sports car\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category multi|Hyundai Tiburon|Hyundai Coup\u00e9|Hyundai Tuscani}}\n\n{{Hyundai cars}}\n{{Hyundai North America}}\n{{Hyundai Motor Company}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[Category:Hyundai vehicles|Tiburon]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive sports cars]]\n[[Category:Sport compact cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1996]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Rally cars]]\n", "name_user": "Blue Ninjakoopa", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFirst generation (1996\u20132001)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Tiburon"}

Although he temporarily achieved popular success and fortune, Fitzgerald did not receive much critical acclaim until after his death. He published four novels, four collections of short stories, as well as 164 short stories in magazines during his lifetime. Fitzgerald is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.\n\nFitzgerald was born into an upper-middle-class family in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], but was primarily raised in [[New York state|New York]]. He attended [[Princeton University]], but due to a failed relationship and a preoccupation with writing, he left Princeton in 1917 to join the [[United States Army|army]]. While stationed in [[Alabama]], he fell in love with rich socialite [[Zelda Sayre]]. Although she initially rejected him due to his financial situation, Zelda married Fitzgerald after he had published ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' (1920). \n\nIn the 1920s, Fitzgerald  frequented Europe, where his writing was influenced by the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the \"[[Lost Generation]]\" expatriate community. His second novel, ''[[The Beautiful and Damned]]'' (1922), propelled him into the [[New York City]] elite. To maintain his lifestyle during this time, he also wrote several stories for magazines. His third novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925), was inspired by his rise to fame and relationship with Zelda. Although it received mixed reviews, ''The Great Gatsby'' is now widely praised, with some even labeling it the \"[[Great American Novel]]\". While Zelda was placed at a mental institute for her [[schizophrenia]], Fitzgerald completed his final novel, ''[[Tender Is the Night]]'' (1934).\n\nFaced with financial difficulties due to the declining popularity of his works, Fitzgerald began working in [[Hollywood]], writing and revising screenplays. After a long struggle with alcoholism, he died in 1940, at the age of 44. A fifth, unfinished novel, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' (1941), was completed by [[Edmund Wilson]] and published after Fitzgerald's death. \n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\n[[File:F Scott Fitzgerald and his mother St Paul Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Fitzgerald as a child in Minnesota]]\nBorn in 1896 in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], to an upper-middle-class family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, three times removed on his father's side, [[Francis Scott Key]],<ref>Matthew Joseph Bruccoli and Scottie Fitzgerald Smith, ''Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F.

Fitzgerald tried to continue working on his fourth novel, but by this point it had become clear that Zelda had an extreme mental illness as her behavior grew increasingly erratic. By 1930 she was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. Fitzgerald had her treated at [[Prangins clinic]] in [[Switzerland]] They returned to America in September 1931.<ref name=\"life_of_fitzgerald\"/> But once again, February 1932, she was hospitalized at the Phipps Clinic at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/baltimore/baltimore_f_scott_fitzgerald_in_baltimore/|title = F.

The book went through many versions, the first of which was to be a story of [[matricide]].  Some critics have seen the book as a thinly veiled [[autobiographical novel]] recounting Fitzgerald's problems with his wife, the corrosive effects of wealth and a decadent lifestyle, his own egoism and self-confidence, and his continuing [[alcoholism]]. Indeed, Fitzgerald was extremely protective of his \"material\" (i.e., their life together).  When Zelda wrote and sent to Scribner's her own fictional version of their lives in Europe, ''[[Save Me the Waltz]]'', Fitzgerald was angry and was able to make some changes prior to the novel's publication, and convince her doctors to keep her from writing any more about what he called his \"material\", which included their relationship. His book was finally published in 1934 as ''[[Tender Is the Night]]''. Critics who had waited nine years for the followup to ''The Great Gatsby'' had mixed opinions about the novel. Most were thrown off by its three-part structure and many felt that Fitzgerald had not lived up to their expectations.<ref>Donaldson, Scott, ed. Critical Essays on F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. Boston, MA: G.K.

Scott and Zelda moved into a studio-owned bungalow in January of the following year and Fitzgerald soon met and began an affair with [[Lois Moran]].

Another film, ''[[Last Call (2002 film)|Last Call]]'' (2002) ([[Jeremy Irons]] plays Fitzgerald) describes the relationship of Fitzgerald and [[Frances Kroll Ring]] ([[Neve Campbell]]) during his last two years of life.  [[David Hoflin]] and [[Christina Ricci]] portrayed the Fitzgerald\u2019s in [[Amazon Prime]]'s 2015 television series ''[[Z: The Beginning of Everything]]''. Others include the TV movies ''[[Zelda (film)|Zelda]]'' (1993, with [[Timothy Hutton]]), ''F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood'' (1976, with [[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]]), and ''[[F.

Although he temporarily achieved popular success and fortune, Fitzgerald did not receive much critical acclaim until after his death. He published four novels, four collections of short stories, as well as 164 short stories in magazines during his lifetime. Fitzgerald is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.\n\nFitzgerald was born into an upper-middle-class family in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], but was primarily raised in [[New York state|New York]]. He attended [[Princeton University]], but due to a failed relationship and a preoccupation with writing, he left Princeton in 1917 to join the [[United States Army|army]]. While stationed in [[Alabama]], he fell in love with rich socialite [[Zelda Sayre]]. Although she initially rejected him due to his financial situation, Zelda married Fitzgerald after he had published ''[[This Side of Paradise]]'' (1920). \n\nIn the 1920s, Fitzgerald  frequented Europe, where his writing was influenced by the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the \"[[Lost Generation]]\" expatriate community. His second novel, ''[[The Beautiful and Damned]]'' (1922), propelled him into the [[New York City]] elite. To maintain his lifestyle during this time, he also wrote several stories for magazines. His third novel, ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' (1925), was inspired by his rise to fame and relationship with Zelda. Although it received mixed reviews, ''The Great Gatsby'' is now widely praised, with some even labeling it the \"[[Great American Novel]]\". While Zelda was placed at a mental institute for her [[schizophrenia]], Fitzgerald completed his final novel, ''[[Tender Is the Night]]'' (1934).\n\nFaced with financial difficulties due to the declining popularity of his works, Fitzgerald began working in [[Hollywood]], writing and revising screenplays. After a long struggle with alcoholism, he died in 1940, at the age of 44. A fifth, unfinished novel, ''[[The Last Tycoon]]'' (1941), was completed by [[Edmund Wilson]] and published after Fitzgerald's death. \n\n==Life==\n===Early life===\n[[File:F Scott Fitzgerald and his mother St Paul Minnesota.jpg|thumb|Fitzgerald as a child in Minnesota]]\nBorn in 1896 in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], to an upper-middle-class family, Fitzgerald was named after his famous second cousin, three times removed on his father's side, [[Francis Scott Key]],<ref>Matthew Joseph Bruccoli and Scottie Fitzgerald Smith, ''Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F.

Hemingway did not get on well with Zelda, however, and in addition to describing her as \"insane\" in his memoir ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'',<ref>\n{{cite book |last = Hemingway |first = Ernest |author-link= Ernest Hemingway |date= 1964|title= A Moveable Feast  |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Moveable_Feast.html?id=ohpj2Nl9EYQC |location=New York |publisher= Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn= 9780743237291}}</ref> Hemingway claimed that Zelda \"encouraged her husband to drink so as to distract Fitzgerald from his work on his novel\",<ref name=\"canterbury\">Canterbury, E.

Like most professional authors at the time, Fitzgerald supplemented his income by writing short stories for such magazines as ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'', ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'', and ''[[Esquire magazine|Esquire]]'', and sold his stories and novels to Hollywood studios. This \"whoring\", as Fitzgerald and, subsequently, Hemingway called these sales,<ref name=MoveableFeast1>Hemingway, Ernest \u2013 ''A Moveable Feast'', Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1964.</ref> was a sore point in the two authors' friendship. Fitzgerald claimed that he would first write his stories in an 'authentic' manner, then rewrite them to put in the \"twists that made them into salable magazine stories\".<ref name=\"canterbury\"/>\n\nWhile Scott had been writing ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', Zelda had become infatuated with a young French aviator, Edouard S.

After six weeks, Zelda asked for a divorce. Scott at first demanded to confront Jozan, but instead dealt with Zelda's demand by locking her in their house, until she abandoned her request for divorce. Jozan did not know she'd asked for a divorce. He left the Riviera later that year, and the Fitzgeralds never saw him again. Later in life he told Zelda's biographer Milford that any infidelity was imaginary: \"They both had a need of drama, they made it up and perhaps they were the victims of their own unsettled and a little unhealthy imagination.\"<ref>\n{{cite book |last = Milford |first = Nancy |author-link= Nancy Milford |date= 1970|title= Zelda: A Biography  |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NqlaAAAAMAAJ |location=New York |publisher= [[Harper & Row]] |pp=108\u2013112 |isbn= 1-57003-455-9}}</ref> In ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'', Hemingway claimed that Zelda taunted Fitzgerald over the [[Human penis size|size of his penis]].

Fitzgerald tried to continue working on his fourth novel, but by this point it had become clear that Zelda had an extreme mental illness as her behavior grew increasingly erratic. By 1930 she was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. Fitzgerald had her treated at [[Prangins clinic]] in [[Switzerland]] They returned to America in September 1931.<ref name=\"life_of_fitzgerald\"/> But once again, February 1932, she was hospitalized at the Phipps Clinic at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/baltimore/baltimore_f_scott_fitzgerald_in_baltimore/|title = F.

The book went through many versions, the first of which was to be a story of [[matricide]].  Some critics have seen the book as a thinly veiled [[autobiographical novel]] recounting Fitzgerald's problems with his wife, the corrosive effects of wealth and a decadent lifestyle, his own egoism and self-confidence, and his continuing [[alcoholism]]. Indeed, Fitzgerald was extremely protective of his \"material\" (i.e., their life together).  When Zelda wrote and sent to Scribner's her own fictional version of their lives in Europe, ''[[Save Me the Waltz]]'', Fitzgerald was angry and was able to make some changes prior to the novel's publication, and convince her doctors to keep her from writing any more about what he called his \"material\", which included their relationship. His book was finally published in 1934 as ''[[Tender Is the Night]]''. Critics who had waited nine years for the followup to ''The Great Gatsby'' had mixed opinions about the novel. Most were thrown off by its three-part structure and many felt that Fitzgerald had not lived up to their expectations.<ref>Donaldson, Scott, ed. Critical Essays on F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. Boston, MA: G.K.

Scott and Zelda moved into a studio-owned bungalow in January of the following year and Fitzgerald soon met and began an affair with [[Lois Moran]]. The starlet became a temporary muse for the author and he rewrote Rosemary Hoyt, one of the central characters in ''Tender is the Night''\u2014who had been a male in earlier drafts\u2014to closely mirror her.

Another film, ''[[Last Call (2002 film)|Last Call]]'' (2002) ([[Jeremy Irons]] plays Fitzgerald) describes the relationship of Fitzgerald and [[Frances Kroll Ring]] ([[Neve Campbell]]) during his last two years of life.  [[David Hoflin]] and [[Christina Ricci]] portrayed the Fitzgerald\u2019s in [[Amazon Prime]]'s 2015 television series ''[[Z: The Beginning of Everything]]''.

Released on October 28, 1997 by the record label [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]], it is RuPaul's first album featuring Christmas music and serves as a follow-up to his 1996 album [[Foxy Lady (RuPaul album)|''Foxy Lady'']]. RuPaul co-produced the album with [[Fenton Bailey]] and [[Randy Barbato]] from the production company [[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]]. ''Ho Ho Ho'' consists of thirteen tracks, including ten covers of [[Christmas music#Popular Christmas songs|Christmas standards]] and [[Christmas carol|carols]], and three original songs written by Joe Carrano and RuPaul. [[Music criticism|Music critics]] frequently described the album as an example of [[Camp (style)|camp]] though RuPaul clarified that it included several more serious covers, specifically \"[[All Alone on Christmas]]\" and \"[[Hard Candy Christmas]]\".\n\n''Ho Ho Ho'' was praised by critics following its release and during retrospective reviews; its cheerful and humorous compositions were frequently cited as the album's highlights, though some commentators responded negatively to the record's use of humor and the lack of clarity in its overall message. It was included in a 2016 parody list discussing the [[alt-right]], the [[Christmas controversies|\"War on Christmas]]\", and the [[bathroom bill]]. The album peaked at number 27 on the [[Heatseekers Albums]] [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] chart, selling a little more than 4,000 copies in one week.

RuPaul co-produced the album with [[Fenton Bailey]] and [[Randy Barbato]] from the production company [[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]]. ''Ho Ho Ho'' consists of thirteen tracks, including ten covers of [[Christmas music#Popular Christmas songs|Christmas standards]] and [[Christmas carol|carols]], and three original songs written by Joe Carrano and RuPaul. [[Music criticism|Music critics]] frequently described the album as an example of [[Camp (style)|camp]] though RuPaul clarified that it included several more serious covers, specifically \"[[All Alone on Christmas]]\" and \"[[Hard Candy Christmas]]\".\n\n''Ho Ho Ho'' was praised by critics following its release and during retrospective reviews; its cheerful and humorous compositions were frequently cited as the album's highlights, though some commentators responded negatively to the record's use of humor and the lack of clarity in its overall message.
