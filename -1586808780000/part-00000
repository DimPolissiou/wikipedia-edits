Her son Timothy is ill with pneumonia just as the farmer Mr. Fitzgibbon begins preparation for spring plowing in the garden where the Frisby family lives. Normally she would move her family, but Timothy would not survive the cold trip to their summer home. Mrs. Frisby obtains medicine from her friend Mr. Ages, an older white mouse. On the return journey, she saves the life of Jeremy, a young crow, from Dragon, the farmer's cat\u2013 the same cat who killed her husband, Jonathan. Jeremy suggests she seek help in moving Timothy from an owl who dwells in the forest. Jeremy flies Mrs. Frisby to the owl's tree, but the owl says he cannot help until he finds out that she is the widow of Jonathan Frisby. He suggests that Mrs. Frisby seek help from the rats who live in a rosebush near her.\n\nMrs. Frisby discovers the rats have a literate and mechanized society. They have technology such as elevators, have tapped the electricity grid to provide lighting and heating and have acquired other human skills, such as storing food for the winter. Their leader, Nicodemus, tells Mrs. Frisby of the rats' capture by scientists working for a laboratory located at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) and the subsequent experiments that the humans performed on the rats, which increased the rats' intelligence to the point of being able to read, write and operate complicated machines, as well as enhancing their longevity and strength. This increased intelligence and strength allowed them to escape from the NIMH laboratories and migrate to their present location. Jonathan Frisby and Mr. Ages were the only two survivors of a group of eight [[mice]] who had been part of the experiments at NIMH and made the rats' escape possible. Out of their respect and unending gratitude for Jonathan, the rats agree to move Mrs. Frisby's house to a location safe from the plow.\n\nNicodemus also tells Mrs. Frisby about \"The Plan\", which is to abandon their lifestyle of dependence on humans, which some rats regard as theft, for a new, independent farming colony. One rat, Jenner, disagreed vehemently with The Plan and left the colony with a group of followers at some point prior to Mrs. Frisby's arrival.\n\nTo move the Frisby home, the rats have to drug Dragon, as it is too dangerous to work in the open with the cat wandering nearby. However, Mr. Ages has a broken leg and cannot dash to Dragon's bowl to put in the drug. Since the rats are too big to fit into the hole in the wall to enter the house, Mrs. Frisby volunteers to go. Unfortunately, she is caught by the family's son, Billy, who puts her in a cage. While captured, Mrs. Frisby overhears the Fitzgibbons discussing an incident at a nearby hardware store in which a group of rats was electrocuted after seemingly attempting to steal a small motor. This has attracted the attention of a group of men who have offered to exterminate the rat colony on Fitzgibbons' land free of charge for him.\n\nAt night, the rat Justin comes to save Mrs. Frisby and manages to get her out of the cage. Mrs. Frisby warns Justin of what she learned while captured; they assume that the rats at the hardware store were all from Jenner's group and that the group of men were from NIMH and are looking for them specifically.\n\nThe successful house move allows the mouse family to remain so that Timothy has time to recover before moving to their summer home. Although the rats have not yet had time to move everything they needed for The Plan, they manage to destroy their underground rooms and create the vision that they are just regular rats by placing rubbish in the remaining rooms. As the others move, ten rats stay back so the exterminators would not think the rat hole has been abandoned. When the exterminators fill the rat hole with toxic gas, eight of the ten rats manage to escape, while two rats die in the hole. It is not revealed exactly who these two are.\n\nOnce Timothy recovers, Mrs. Frisby and her family move to their summer home and Mrs. Frisby tells her children the full story of their father and the rats of NIMH.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal-winning books from 1966 to 1975, children's author [[John Rowe Townsend]] wrote, \"It seems to me that the fact that all the animals talk and behave intelligently from the beginning of the story detracts from the spectacular development of the laboratory rats... ''Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH'' is a pleasing book, but I find it mildly frustrating; it might have been something more than it is.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Townsend |first=John Rowe |authorlink=John Rowe Townsend |chapter=A Decade of Newbery Books in Perspective |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newberycaldecott0000unse/page/148 148-149] |title=Newbery and Caldecott Medal Books: 1966-1975 |editor-last=Kingman |editor-first=Lee |publisher=[[The Horn Book Magazine|The Horn Book, Incorporated]] |location=[[Boston]] |year=1975 |isbn=0-87675-003-X |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/newberycaldecott0000unse/page/148 }}</ref>\n\n==Related works==\nAfter his death, O'Brien's daughter, [[Jane Leslie Conly]], wrote two other novels based on the rats of NIMH. ''[[Racso and the Rats of NIMH]]'' tells the story of a city rat who runs away to join the new colony, befriending Timothy, while saving the colony from a flood along the way. In ''[[R-T, Margaret, and the Rats of NIMH]]'', the rats rescue two lost human children who in turn help to save the colony before winter.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\nIn 1982, the animated film ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]'' was released, directed by [[Don Bluth]]. The film adds a mystical element completely absent from the novel, with Nicodemus portrayed as a wise, bearded old wizard with magic powers and an enchanted amulet, rather than an equal of the other rats. The character of Jenner is made a villain who is still present with the rats, rather than having left them before the story begins. The crow Jeremy has much greater prominence as [[comic relief]] in the film than he has in the book. Additionally, the Frisby family name was changed to \"Brisby\" to avoid trademark infringement with the [[Frisbee]].<ref name=\"cawley_tail\">{{cite book |last=Cawley |first=John |title=The Animated Films of Don Bluth |date=October 1991 |chapter=The Secret of N.I.M.H. |publisher=Image Pub of New York |isbn=0-685-50334-8 |chapter-url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBnimh.html}}</ref>\n\n'''In production'''\n\nIn July 2009, [[Paramount Pictures]] set [[Neil Burger]] to write the script and [[Cary Granat]] to produce the film based on the book.<ref>{{cite news|last1=O.|first1=Courtney|title=Paramount Set for ''Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH''|url=http://www.movieweb.com/paramount-set-for-mrs-frisby-and-the-rats-of-nimh|accessdate=March 9, 2015|website=movieweb|date=July 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 2015, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]], which had released the 1982 film, acquired the rights to the book to adapt it into a live-action/animated film.

While continuing its predecessor's general mood and atmosphere, it distinguishes itself by incorporating [[synthesizer]]s and other such [[keyboard instrument]]s. ''Autumn Aurora'' has frequently been cited as Drudkh's finest album, although some fans give the nod to the later ''[[Blood in Our Wells]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} This record had a strong critical success: for example, it was chosen the best album of the year by [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] web-zine.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-714_best_albums_of_2004.aspx\n| title = CoC : Rant : Best Albums of 2004\n| work = [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]]\n| date = February 28, 2005\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Autumn Aurora'', Amorth (drums, keyboards) joined the band and replaced Yuriy.\n\n''[[The Swan Road]]'' (''\u041b\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u043b\u044f\u0445''), released on March 14, 2005 (see [[2005 in music]]), marked a departure in a number of ways. It was well reviewed and is the first Drudkh album to have Ukrainian lyrics, all of which are adapted or taken directly from the work ''[[Haydamaky (poem)|The Haidamakas]]'' ([[1841 in literature|1841]]) by [[Taras Shevchenko]], narrating about the [[Koliyivshchyna|Ukrainian anti-Polish uprising]] of 1768.<ref>{{cite web\n| author = Polarstern, Smierc\n| date = 2010\n| url = http://politosophia.org/page/drudkh-s-anthology-of-time.html \n| title = Drudkh\u2019s anthology of time\n| work = Politosophia\n}}</ref> Its CD booklet included prints of Shevchenko's notebooks, which many non-Ukrainian-speaking fans mistook for song lyrics. The addition of Shevchenko's poetry can also be said to have given Drudkh's music a more pronounced [[Ukrainian nationalism|nationalistic leaning]] (a move continued on the next album). The music's atmosphere is also significantly more urgent, with the drums pushed to the forefront of the mix and a vastly increased use of [[blast beat]]s.\n\nOn March 23, 2006 (see [[2006 in music]]), Drudkh released ''Blood in Our Wells'' (''\u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044f\u0445''), once again through Supernal Music. On this album, poetry from four nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets (including [[Oleksandr Oles]] and [[Lina Kostenko]]) serves as lyrical material, and the album itself was dedicated to [[Stepan Bandera]], leader of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]]. Musically, the album adds [[progressive rock]] influences and an increased use of traditional [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[guitar solo|soloing]] into the mix, while retaining the band's tradition of blending black metal and Ukrainian folk music. In part because several tracks sample the Ukrainian poetic film ''[[Mamay (film)|Mamay]]'' (2003), the album is considered more cinematic than its predecessors. Many fans have cited this album as the band's best work to date. It was Drudkh's first record to appear in the ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' Top 40 year list, placing at number 35.<ref name=rocklistmusic.co.uk>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/terroris.htm\n| title = Terrorizer Magazine\n| work = Rocklist.net\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter the release of ''Blood in Our Wells'', Amorth was exiled from the band and new members Krechet (bass) and Vlad (drums) joined.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn October 19, 2006, Drudkh released ''[[Songs of Grief and Solitude]]'' (''\u041f\u0456\u0441\u043d\u0456 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u0456 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0456\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456''). This release is composed of folk music, with much of the music containing melodic elements from previous Drudkh compositions (for example, \"The Cranes Will Never Return Here\" is based on a riff from \"Solitude\" on ''Blood in Our Wells'', and \"Archaic Dance\" is based on a riff from \"Glare of 1768\" on ''The Swan Road''). It is entirely instrumental, with barely any drumming, and prominently features wind instruments.

Its lyrics were based completely on the 1931-1932 works of Ukrainian poet Oleh Olzhych. Reception to the album has been largely positive, with many fans hailing it as a return to the band's roots or praising the band's musicianship demonstrated in the album's many solos. Notably, the album also featured the band's first prominent use of blast beats since ''The Swan Road''.

The music's atmosphere is also significantly more urgent, with the drums pushed to the forefront of the mix and a vastly increased use of [[blast beat]]s.\n\nOn March 23, 2006 (see [[2006 in music]]), Drudkh released ''Blood in Our Wells'' (''\u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044f\u0445''), once again through Supernal Music. On this album, poetry from four nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets (including [[Oleksandr Oles]] and [[Lina Kostenko]]) serves as lyrical material, and the album itself was dedicated to [[Stepan Bandera]], leader of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]]. Musically, the album adds [[progressive rock]] influences and an increased use of traditional [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[guitar solo|soloing]] into the mix, while retaining the band's tradition of blending black metal and Ukrainian folk music. In part because several tracks sample the Ukrainian poetic film ''[[Mamay (film)|Mamay]]'' (2003), the album is considered more cinematic than its predecessors. Many fans have cited this album as the band's best work to date. It was Drudkh's first record to appear in the ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' Top 40 year list, placing at number 35.<ref name=rocklistmusic.co.uk>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/terroris.htm\n| title = Terrorizer Magazine\n| work = Rocklist.net\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter the release of ''Blood in Our Wells'', Amorth was exiled from the band and new members Krechet (bass) and Vlad (drums) joined.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn October 19, 2006, Drudkh released ''[[Songs of Grief and Solitude]]'' (''\u041f\u0456\u0441\u043d\u0456 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u0456 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0456\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456''). This release is composed of folk music, with much of the music containing melodic elements from previous Drudkh compositions (for example, \"The Cranes Will Never Return Here\" is based on a riff from \"Solitude\" on ''Blood in Our Wells'', and \"Archaic Dance\" is based on a riff from \"Glare of 1768\" on ''The Swan Road''). It is entirely instrumental, with barely any drumming, and prominently features wind instruments. The album received mixed reviews, with some fans criticising the band for reusing old material, and others praising the band's radical reconstruction of its own sound.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn April 16, 2007 (see [[2007 in music]]), Supernal Music released Drudkh's ''[[Anti-Urban]]'', a 45-RPM 10&nbsp;inch coloured vinyl limited to 999 copies containing exclusive tracks available only to Supernal Music customers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} [[Season of Mist]] later re-released it as a [[mini CD]] in 2009 as part of the deluxe box-set edition of ''[[Microcosmos (Drudkh album)|Microcosmos]]'', and it was also included on the band's collection ''Eastern Frontier in Flames''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe band's next release, a full-length black metal album titled ''[[Estrangement (album)|Estrangement]]'' (''\u0412i\u0434\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043di\u0441\u0442\u044c''), was released on August 25, 2007 as a deluxe edition.<ref name=supernalmusic>{{cite web\n| url = http://supernalmusic.livejournal.com/37340.html\n| title = Drudkh (Ukr): 'Estrangement' CD Deluxe\n| work = Supernal Music\n| date = August 30, 2007\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref> The album, which had the working title ''River of Tears'', had been rumored to have a \"[[Burzum]]ic\" feel before its release, and in some ways this was borne out by the album's release; its songs were in many ways significantly more minimalistic than those on ''Blood in Our Wells''. Its lyrics were based completely on the 1931-1932 works of Ukrainian poet Oleh Olzhych. Reception to the album has been largely positive, with many fans hailing it as a return to the band's roots or praising the band's musicianship demonstrated in the album's many solos. Notably, the album also featured the band's first prominent use of blast beats since ''The Swan Road''. A spoken introduction in the first track is taken from the 1995 Ukrainian feature film ''{{ill|Assassination.

{"title_page": "Ordnance Survey Memoirs of Ireland", "text_new": "The '''Ordnance Memoir of Ireland''' was a projected 1830s [[topography]] of [[Ireland]] to be published by [[Civil parish (Ireland)|civil parish]] alongside the maps of the [[Ordnance Survey of Ireland]] using materials gathered by surveyors as they traversed the country. The project was cancelled in 1840 as too expensive and beyond the survey's original scope. Material gathered before the cancellation mostly covers [[Ulster]]. Much was eventually published in the later twentieth century. The memoirs are a useful [[primary source]] for [[local history]] and [[genealogy]] of the period shortly before the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].\n\nMaterials gathered for the projected memoir included:\n* 1824\u20131830 journals of the officers of the [[Royal Engineers]] in conformance to the \"blue book\" of instructions from [[Thomas Frederick Colby|Thomas Colby]] as head of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. None of these survive.\n* 1830\u20131837 \"statistical remarks\" of parishes sent by the same officers to [[Thomas Larcom]] from his arrival in Dublin. These vary greatly in substance and reliability depending on the interests and abilities of the officer in charge of the particular parish. They are very extensive for counties [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Antrim|Antrim]], the first and slowest  to be surveyed. As the survey matured and progressed east and south through other [[Counties of Ireland|counties]], it picked up speed in completing its primary mapping work, leaving officers less spare time in which to gather material for the memoir .\n* 1834\u20131840 memoir material gathered by the civilian \"hill sketchers\" sent to revise the original survey in the wake of the Royal Engineers. By 1837 the Engineers ceased collecting material, on the assumption that it would be collected when the area would be revisited by the hill sketchers.  \n* Geological information gathered by [[Joseph Ellison Portlock]]; that relating to County Londonderry (and small adjacent areas) was published in 1843,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Portlock |first1=Joseph Ellison |title=Report on the Geology of the County of Londonderry, and of Parts of Tyrone and Fermanagh |date=1843 |publisher=A. Milliken |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qw68AAAAIAAJ |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> after which the [[Geological Survey of Ireland]] was separated from the Ordnance Survey\n* Related to, but separate from, the memoir material are the \"Ordnance Survey Letters\" and  Name Books compiled by [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] and [[Eugene O'Curry]], of current and historical [[Irish place names|place names]] in English and especially [[Irish language|Irish]], and associated {{lang|ga|[[dindsenchas]]}} folklore and [[Irish annals|annalistic]] references.\n\nOnly one parish was published by the Ordnance Survey, namely Templemore, County Londonderry (comprising [[Derry]] city and the adjacent [[North West Liberties of Londonderry]]) in 1837.<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoir of the City and North Western Liberties of Londonderry \u2014 Parish of Templemore |date=1837 |publisher=Hodges |location=Dublin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EcxcAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP9  |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>  This 350-page volume was a poorly edited agglomeration of material whose production cost of \u00a31,700 was three times the original estimate for publishing the whole county.  ''[[A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland]]'', comprising two volumes plus atlas published in 1837 by [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]], was a similar work on a smaller scale, which undermined the case for a publicly funded memoir. The decennial census of 1841 also rendered redundant much of the basic statistical information in the memoirs. Work ceased in 1840.   In 1842, [[Robert Peel]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], was approached by Irish politicians about reviving the memoir, and agreed to have the question considered by a commission, whose report published in 1843 advocated revival.<ref>{{cite book |title=Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the facts relating to the ordnance memoir of Ireland |date=1844 |url=https://archive.org/details/op1246086-1001/ |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=HMSO |location=London |series=Parliamentary Papers |volume=HC 1844 XXX }}</ref> However, only the geological survey was continued.\n\nThe original memoir material and name books were donated by the Ordnance Survey to the [[Royal Irish Academy]]. The [[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland]] holds [[microfilm]] copies.  The memoir text was published from 1990, in 40 volumes plus index, edited by Ang\u00e9lique Day and Patrick McWilliams of the Institute of Irish Studies at [[Queen's University Belfast]].

The project was cancelled in 1840 as too expensive and beyond the survey's original scope. Material gathered before the cancellation mostly covers [[Ulster]]. Much was eventually published in the later twentieth century. The memoirs are a useful [[primary source]] for [[local history]] and [[genealogy]] of the period shortly before the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].\n\nMaterials gathered for the projected memoir included:\n* 1824\u20131830 journals of the officers of the [[Royal Engineers]] in conformance to the \"blue book\" of instructions from [[Thomas Frederick Colby|Thomas Colby]] as head of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. None of these survive.\n* 1830\u20131837 \"statistical remarks\" of parishes sent by the same officers to [[Thomas Larcom]] from his arrival in Dublin. These vary greatly in substance and reliability depending on the interests and abilities of the officer in charge of the particular parish. They are very extensive for counties [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Antrim|Antrim]], the first and slowest  to be surveyed. As the survey matured and progressed east and south through other [[Counties of Ireland|counties]], it picked up speed in completing its primary mapping work, leaving officers less spare time in which to gather material for the memoir .\n* 1834\u20131840 memoir material gathered by the civilian \"hill sketchers\" sent to revise the original survey in the wake of the Royal Engineers. By 1837 the Engineers ceased collecting material, on the assumption that it would be collected when the area would be revisited by the hill sketchers.  \n* Geological information gathered by [[Joseph Ellison Portlock]]; that relating to County Londonderry (and small adjacent areas) was published in 1843,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Portlock |first1=Joseph Ellison |title=Report on the Geology of the County of Londonderry, and of Parts of Tyrone and Fermanagh |date=1843 |publisher=A. Milliken |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qw68AAAAIAAJ |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> after which the [[Geological Survey of Ireland]] was separated from the Ordnance Survey\n* Related to, but separate from, the memoir material are the \"Ordnance Survey Letters\" and  Name Books compiled by [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] and [[Eugene O'Curry]], of current and historical [[Irish place names|place names]] in English and especially [[Irish language|Irish]], and associated {{lang|ga|[[dindsenchas]]}} folklore and [[Irish annals|annalistic]] references.\n\nOnly one parish was published by the Ordnance Survey, namely Templemore, County Londonderry (comprising [[Derry]] city and the adjacent [[North West Liberties of Londonderry]]) in 1837.<ref>{{cite book |title=Memoir of the City and North Western Liberties of Londonderry \u2014 Parish of Templemore |date=1837 |publisher=Hodges |location=Dublin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EcxcAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP9  |accessdate=13 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>  This 350-page volume was a poorly edited agglomeration of material whose production cost of \u00a31,700 was three times the original estimate for publishing the whole county.  ''[[A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland]]'', comprising two volumes plus atlas published in 1837 by [[Samuel Lewis (publisher)|Samuel Lewis]], was a similar work on a smaller scale, which undermined the case for a publicly funded memoir. The decennial census of 1841 also rendered redundant much of the basic statistical information in the memoirs. Work ceased in 1840.   In 1842, [[Robert Peel]] was approached by Irish politicians about reviving the memoir, and agreed to a commission, whose report published in 1843 advocated reviving it.<ref>{{cite book |title=Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the facts relating to the ordnance memoir of Ireland |date=1844 |url=https://archive.org/details/op1246086-1001/ |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=HMSO |location=London |series=Parliamentary Papers |volume=HC 1844 XXX }}</ref> However, only the geological survey was continued.\n\nThe original memoir material and name books were donated by the Ordnance Survey to the [[Royal Irish Academy]]. The [[Public Record Office of Northern Ireland]] holds [[microfilm]] copies.  The memoir text was published from 1990, in 40 volumes plus index, edited by Ang\u00e9lique Day and Patrick McWilliams of the Institute of Irish Studies at [[Queen's University Belfast]]. A separate volume of some of the pen-and-ink sketches in the memoirs was published in 2014.

His rule was considered secular and as such he was occasionally accorded the title \"king\". However whether this was ever a title accepted by the Holy See is unclear. One of the most fervent contemporary critic of his [[infallibility]] [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|dogma]], [[Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], considered the \"political regime\" of the pope in the Papal States as \"wise, well-intentioned, mild-natured, frugal and open for innovations\".<ref>Schmidlin 45</ref> Yet there was controversy. In the period before the [[1848 revolution]], Pius IX was a most ardent reformer. After the revolution however, his political reforms and constitutional improvements were considered minimalists, remaining largely within the framework of the 1850 laws mentioned above<ref>Schmidlin 47</ref>\n\n=== Governmental structure ===\n{{main|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\nThe governmental structure of the Papal States reflected the dual spiritual-secular character of the papacy at the time. The secular or lay persons were strongly in the majority with 6850 persons versus 300 members of the clergy. But the clergy occupied the key decision making positions and every job applicant had to present a character evaluation from his Parish priests in order to be considered.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\">Stehle 47</ref>\n\nThe Cardinal Secretary of State appointed and dismissed ministers of which three were lay people. Their decisions were subject to papal approvals. They were ministers for: ''Internal Affairs'' including Police and Health; ''Commerce,'' including trade, crafts and industry, agriculture, arts, railways; ''War'', including the papal army; ''Clemency and Justice'' including police and the judiciary.<ref name=\"Stehle 47\"/>\n\n=== Finance ===\n[[File:Romapio9col.jpg|280px|thumb|left|A view of the pastoral setting in the centre of Rome showing the [[Coloseum]] and [[Foro Romano]] around 1870]]\nThe financial administration in the Papal States under Pius IX were increasingly put in the hands of lay persons. The budget and financial administration in the Papal States had long been subject to criticism even before Pius IX, and did not end with his papacy. In 1850, he created a governmental finance congregation consisting of four lay persons with finance    background for the twenty provinces. The chronic budget deficit disappeared by 1858. There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>\n\nThe criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>\n\n=== Commerce and trade ===\n[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>\n\nTo increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>\n\n=== Justice ===\nThe justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]\nA unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>\n\n=== Education ===\nLiberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: he created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, he created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>\n\n[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] \nThe two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities. He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions, and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], and [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums, and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\" /> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>\n\n=== Social life ===\nTheir one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L\u2019Osservatore Romano]] which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]\nPius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman Churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements including the existing marble floors, and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factors for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>\n\nGreat efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discovers of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>\n[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]\n\n=== Protestants and Jews ===\n{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}\nThe Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time: At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>\n\nIn 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\"<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls from [[The Times]], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> to return the child to his parents, were politely rejected.\n\n==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==\n\n===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===\n[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.\n\n===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===\nIn the years that followed, Italian nationalists \u2014 both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution \u2014 saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.\n\n===Second Italian War of Independence===\n[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]\nAfter the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].\n\n===Rome declared capital of Italy===\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]\nRome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].\n\n===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.\n\n:The Pope\u2019s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King\u2019s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.\n\n===Prisoner of the Vatican===\nIn 1929, the papacy \u2014 then under [[Pope Pius XI]] \u2014 renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n* Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877\n* Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K\u00f6stel-Pusztet M\u00fcnchen, 1922-1939\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papal States Under Pope Pius Ix}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius IX]]\n[[Category:History of the Papal States]]\n[[Category:19th century in the Papal States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Merge from|1859 Perugia uprising|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe '''Papal States under [[Pope Pius IX]]''' assumed a much more modern and secular character than had been seen under previous pontificates, and yet this progressive modernization was not nearly sufficient in resisting the tide of political liberalization and unification in Italy during the middle of the 19th century.\n\nA view of the Papal States from the perspective of the mid-19th \ncentury is readily available.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite book \n|title= The Roman Question |author= Edmond About\n|year= 1859 |isbn= 978-1-4255-1934-6}}  This book is a primary reference,\nwritten by a French Catholic observer who visited the Papal States at \nthe time.

There was a steady increase in [[revenue]]s stemming from the [[taxation]] of [[export]]s, [[import]]s and [[trade]] and a decrease in spending especially for the papal army.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\">Schmidlin 50</ref> The tax burden of the citizens was far below European average, which resulted in an influx of foreign residents into Rome, many of them non-Catholics, which created local problems with religious services and their integration. The papacy reacted with new consumption taxes for luxury items and beer, and an exemption from real estate taxes of low-cost houses for long-term residents. A problem after 1850 was the worthless paper money introduced by the revolutionary Republican government in 1848. It was accepted and exchanged at a lower value by the papal treasury.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\">Schmidlin 51</ref>\n\nThe criticism of the economic policies of Pius IX included the argument that the Pope maintained in Rome large areas for [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] at the expense of potential [[industrial development]]. Supporters of Pius point to the increases in agro-industry during his leadership, especially in the areas of [[silk]], [[olive oil]] and [[wine]] production and great productivity gains in agriculture, accredited in part to a scientific research institute and benevolent taxation, which permitted refinancing of existing debts.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 51\"/>\n\n=== Commerce and trade ===\n[[File:Pio91877.jpg|170px|upright|right]]\nPius IX is credited with systematic efforts to improve [[manufacturing]] and trade by giving advantages and papal prizes to domestic producers of [[wool]], [[silk]] and other materials destined for export. He improved the transportation system by building roads, viaducts, bridges and [[sea port]]s. A series of new railway links connected the Papal States to northern Italy. It became soon visible that the Northern Italians were more adept to exploit economically the modern means of communication than the inhabitants in central and Southern Italy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\">Schmidlin 52</ref> A growing discrepancy of income developed poverty in the Papal States, which Pius IX tried to respond to with increased charities. This in turn made him subject to criticism of being too generous to lazy and apathetic populations, making them almost dependent on his social policies.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 52\"/>\n\nTo increase commerce, Pius engaged in numerous and far-reaching agreements with neighbouring states but also with the Belgium, United States, Russia, France, and [[Prussia]] to reduce mutual [[tariff]]s, equal treatment of commercial entities and ships from different states, crime fighting and postal conventions<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\">Schmidlin 53</ref>\n\n=== Justice ===\nThe justice system of the Papal States was subject to numerous accusations at the time, not unlike the justice systems in the rest of Italy. There was a general lack of legal books and standards, and accusations of partiality of the judges. Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\">Schmidlin 49</ref> This problem, immortalized by [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s [[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|''The Betrothed'']], and vividly described by the English Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman]], existed long before Pius IX. In 1854 a reform was issued, intended to clarify jurisdiction. In 1859, Pius ordered the creation of a unified criminal code. He also ordered a reform of papal prisons and penal houses. The Police was put under the Secretary of State, and given more authority and power. This contributed to a significant reduction of crime but also to accusations of partiality.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 49\"/>\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Pio9soldiers.jpg|260px|thumb|upright|left|Papal soldiers around 1860]]\nA unique position was granted to the papal army, consisting almost exclusively of foreigners, since the Roman [[Black Nobility]] was not willing to serve and the population resisted military service as well, despite a decent salary structure and the potential for promotion. A main, but not the only, element of the papal army was the [[Swiss Guard]]. The number of papal soldiers amounted to 15.000 in 1859.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/> The numerous nationalities presented linguistic problems, and their armament was not high on the priority list of Pius IX. During much of his pontificate, the military security was guaranteed by either Austria or France. However, the Austrian and French troops did not always behave like model Christians, creating resentments in the local population and furthering the nationalistic tendencies towards a unified Italy, free of any foreigners.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 50\"/>\n\n=== Education ===\nLiberals attacked Pius IX for his educational policies, which largely were a continuation of traditional Catholic education priorities with an accompanying neglect of the natural sciences on the primary and secondary level. Education was not mandatory in the Papal States, a fact which some attributed to the low educational standards in comparison to other countries. Secondary education was largely in private hands or in the control of Catholic institutes and Religious orders. During his reign, Pius IX undertook innovative efforts: He created new schools for the [[Disability|handicapped]] and evening academies for persons to improve their education after working hours. He also created all-day schools for children, whose parents were absent during the working hours.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> To improve the overall situation, Pius IX created a [[Education|ministry of education]] in 1851.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\">Schmidlin 63</ref>\n\n[[File:Pionono12.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|right|An hagiographic presentation of Pius IX from 1873]] \nThe two papal universities in [[Rome]] and [[Bologna]] suffered much from the revolutionary activities in 1848 but their standards in the areas of science, mathematics, philosophy and theology were considered adequate.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/>  Pius recognized that much had to be done and instituted a reform commission in.<ref>1851</ref> He increased the powers of the ''Camerlengo'' and decided to personally appoint each head of the universities He increased the salaries of the university staff, increased staff positions and added [[geology]], [[agriculture]] [[science]], [[archaeology]], [[astronomy]], [[botany]] to the teaching areas. He created a new clinic for [[pregnant]] women to give birth, several museums and a papal astronomical observatory<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/> [[Theology]] students were subjected to more rigorous training. Theology students from foreign countries benefited from his financial support of [[Germany|German]], [[France|French]], [[Poland|Polish]], [[South America]]n, [[North America]]n, [[England|English]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] seminaries, where they could study together.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 63\"/>\n\n=== Social life ===\nTheir one newspaper ''Giornale di Roma'' and one periodical, ''Civilta Cattolica'', run by [[Jesuits]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 53\"/> When Marcantonio Pacelli, the grandfather of [[Eugenio Pacelli]], approached Pius regarding an official newspaper, [[L\u2019Osservatore Romano]] which actually printed what the Pope said and did the previous day, Pius turned him down. Pacelli published anyway, and [[Leo XIII]] bought it from him a few years later. The social life of Rome centered around the Roman clergy and black nobility, their affairs and scandals. Outsiders, Protestants, and Jews, who came in ever increasing numbers into Rome, had little or no access to these inner circles.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\">Schmidlin 54</ref> After the 1848 revolution, a sense of exclusion and of a lack of progress contributed to the development of an alternative societies, consisting of numerous secret associations, some looking for social change, some conspirative or revolutionary in nature, others aiming at Italian unity, all of which were not tolerated by the government of the Papal States, which saw them threaten the Papal [[theocracy]].<ref name=\"Schmidlin 54\"/>\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:PioLateran.jpg|270px|thumb|upright|left|An 1870 view of the Lateran]]\nPius IX was a patron of the arts like most of his predecessors. The two theatres in Rome were popular in part because he exempted them from any papal [[censorship]]. He generously supported all expressions of art, [[architecture]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[music]], [[goldsmith]]s, [[coppersmith]]s and more, and handed out numerous rewards to its representatives.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\">Schmidlin 55</ref> Much of his efforts were oriented to the Roman Churches but also in the Papal States, many of which were renovated and improved. [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] got numerous improvements including the existing marble floors, and the two statues of the Apostle Peter and Apostle Paul at the Plaza.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 55\"/> He restored profane buildings as well and ordered a renovation of the paintings in the Vatican. He greatly increased the Vatican library and added to the Vatican manufacturing a new factors for mosaics. The papal ministries were ordered to relocate into the centrally located ''Cancellaria'' to enable regular citizens access to papal officials.<ref>Schmidlin 59</ref>\n\nGreat efforts were undertaken to restore historic walls, fountains, streets and bridges. He ordered the excavation of Roman sites, which led to several major discoveries. He ordered the strengthening of the [[Colosseum]] which was threatening to collapse at the time.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\">Schmidlin 61</ref> Huge sums were spent in the discovery of Christian catacombs, for which Pius created a new archaeological commission in 1853. A major success during his pontificate was the discovers of the [[Catacombs of San Callisto]], which included totally unknown tombs, texts and paintings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin 61\"/> Outside of Rome, Pius restored [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and ancient Roman monuments in [[Perugia]], [[Ostia (quarter of Rome)|Ostia]], [[Benevento]], [[Ancona]] and [[Ravenna]]<ref>Schmidlin 62</ref>\n[[File:Pio9stpeter.jpg|300px|thumb|upright|right|An 1870 view of Saint Peter's]]\n\n=== Protestants and Jews ===\n{{Main article|Pope Pius IX and Judaism}}\nThe Papal States were a [[theocracy]] in which the Catholic Church and Catholics had more rights than members of other religions. Pius IX's policies changed over time: At the beginning of his pontificate, together with other liberal measures, Pius opened the Jewish ghetto in Rome. After returning from exile in 1850, during which the [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] issued sharp anti-Church measures,<ref>Pougeois II, p. 429.</ref> the Pope issued a series of anti-liberal measures, including re-instituting the Ghetto.<ref>Pougeois III, 258</ref>\n\nIn 1858, in a highly publicized case, a six-year-old Jewish boy, [[Edgardo Mortara]], was taken from his parents by the police of the Papal States. He had reportedly been [[baptism|baptized]] by a Christian servant girl of the family while he was ill, because she feared that otherwise he would go to [[Hell]] if he died. At that time, the law did not permit Christians to be raised by Jews, even their own parents. Pius IX steadfastly refused \"to extradite a soul\"<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 200.</ref> Calls from [[The Times]], numerous heads of state including [[Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] and Ambassador Gramont<ref>Pougeois IV, p. 196.</ref> to return the child to his parents, were politely rejected.\n\n==Foreign relations and effects of Italian unification==\n\n===Rising tide of Italian nationalism===\n[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which left Italy divided and largely under [[Habsburg]] Austrian domination. In 1848, nationalist and liberal revolutions began to break out across Europe; in 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared and [[Pope Pius IX]] fled the city. [[Napoleon III|Louis Napoleon Bonaparte]], recently elected president of the newly declared [[French Second Republic]], saw an opportunity to assuage conservative Catholic opinion in France, and in cooperation with Austria sent troops to restore Papal rule in Rome. After some hard fighting (in which [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] distinguished himself on the Italian side), Pius was returned to Rome, and repenting of his previous liberal tendencies pursued a harsh, conservative policy even more repressive than that of his predecessors. However, Pius did continue to build railroads, telegraphs, and gas lights.\n\n===Pressures from Sardinia and Savoy===\nIn the years that followed, Italian nationalists \u2014 both those who wished to unify the country under the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and its ruling [[House of Savoy]] and those who favored a republican solution \u2014 saw the Papal States as the chief obstacle to Italian unity. Louis Napoleon, who had now seized control of France as [[Emperor Napoleon III]], tried to play a double game, simultaneously forming an alliance with Sardinia and playing on his famous uncle's nationalist credentials on the one hand and maintaining French troops in Rome to protect the Pope's rights on the other.\n\n===Second Italian War of Independence===\n[[File:Massacro di perugia napoleone verga.jpg|thumb|Regiments of the [[Swiss Guard]] attacking [[1859 Perugia uprising|rebels]] in 1859]]\nAfter the [[Second Italian War of Independence]], much of northern Italy was unified under the House of Savoy's government; in the aftermath, Garibaldi's [[expedition of the Thousand]] overthrew the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] monarchy in the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government in the south, the Sardinians petitioned Napoleon for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the Two Sicilies, which was granted on the condition that Rome was left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year, and a unified Kingdom of Italy was declared. The Papal States were reduced to the [[Latium]] region surrounding Rome, raising the [[Roman Question]].\n\n===Rome declared capital of Italy===\n[[File:Popepiusix.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Pius IX]], under whose rule the Papal States passed into secular control]]\nRome was declared the capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament met in the kingdom's old capital [[Turin]] in Piedmont. However, the Italian Government could not take possession of its capital, because [[Napoleon III]] kept a French garrison in Rome protecting [[Pope Pius IX]]. By the [[September Convention]] of 1864, Napoleon III agreed to withdraw French forces from Rome in return for Italy respecting the borders of the rump Papal States. French forces were withdrawn by 1866, but their absence encouraged Garibaldi to launch a renewed attempt to take Rome and French troops returned, defeating Garibaldi's expedition at the [[Battle of Mentana]] The opportunity to eliminate the last vestige of the Papal States came when the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began in July 1870. Emperor [[Napoleon III]] had to recall his garrison from Rome for France's own defence and could no longer protect the pope. Following the collapse of the Second French Empire at the [[battle of Sedan]].\n\n===Garibaldi's struggle against the papacy===\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon III at Sedan, Garibaldi went to France and assumed command of the Army of the Vosges, an army of volunteers that was never defeated by the Germans. [[Giuseppe Garibaldi#Final struggle with Austria.2C and other adventures|(see Giuseppe Garibaldi)]], widespread public demonstrations demanded that the Italian Government take Rome. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] sent Count [[Gustavo Ponza di San Martino|Ponza di San Martino]] to Pius IX with a personal letter offering a face-saving proposal that would have allowed the peaceful entry of the Italian Army into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope.\n\n:The Pope\u2019s reception of San Martino (10 September 1870) was unfriendly. Pius IX allowed violent outbursts to escape him. Throwing the King\u2019s letter upon the table he exclaimed: \"Fine loyalty! You are all a set of vipers, of whited sepulchres, and wanting in faith.\" He was perhaps alluding to other letters received from the King. Later, growing calmer, he exclaimed: \"I am no prophet, nor son of a prophet, but I tell you, you will never enter Rome!\" San Martino was so mortified that he left the next day.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raffaele |last=De Cesare|title=The Last Days of Papal Rome|url=https://archive.org/details/thelastdaysofpap00cesauoft |publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|location=London|year=1909}}</ref>\n\n===Military resistance to Italy===\nOn September 10, Italy declared war on the Papal States, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the papal frontier on 11 September and advanced slowly toward Rome, hoping that a peaceful entry could be negotiated. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on 19 September and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up at least a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and Latium were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy after a [[plebiscite]] held in the following October.\n\n===Capture of Rome===\n{{Main article|Capture of Rome}}\nThis event, described in Italian history books as a liberation, was taken very bitterly by the Pope. The Italian government had offered to allow the Pope to retain control of the [[Leonine City]] on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], but Pius rejected the overture. Early the following year, the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome. The Pope, whose previous residence, the [[Quirinal Palace]], had become the royal palace of the Kings of Italy, withdrew in protest into the Vatican, where he lived as a [[prisoner in the Vatican|self-proclaimed \"prisoner\"]], refusing to leave or to set foot in [[St. Peter's Square]], and forbidding ([[Non Expedit]]) Catholics on pain of [[excommunication]] to participate in elections in the new Italian state, an action which effectively guaranteed that only persons hostile to the Catholic Church would be involved in the new government.\n\n===Prisoner of the Vatican===\nIn 1929, the papacy \u2014 then under [[Pope Pius XI]] \u2014 renounced its claim to the Papal States<ref>\"The Holy See ... declares that the 'Roman Question' has been definitely and irrevocably settled and therefore eliminated and it recognizes the Kingdom of Italy under the Dynasty of the House of Savoy with Rome as the capital of the Italian State\" ([http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813090725/http://www.vaticanstate.va/NR/rdonlyres/3F574885-EAD5-47E9-A547-C3717005E861/2528/LateranTreaty.pdf |date=2011-08-13 }}</ref> and signed with Italy the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the independent [[Vatican City|State of Vatican City]], \"under the sovereignty of the [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]]\".<ref>Article 26 of the Lateran Treaty</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n* Pougeois, Histoire de Pie IX, son pontificat et son siecle, Vol I-VI, Paris, 1877\n* Schmidlin, Josef, Papstgeschichte, Vol I-IV, K\u00f6stel-Pusztet M\u00fcnchen, 1922-1939\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Papal States Under Pope Pius Ix}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius IX]]\n[[Category:History of the Papal States]]\n[[Category:19th century in the Papal States]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEducation:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papal_States_under_Pope_Pius_IX"}
