Furthermore, Saud's forces brought the highlands of [['Asir]] under their [[suzerainty]], while Muhammad ibn Abd Al Wahhab wrote letters to people and scholars to enter the field of [[jihad]].

{"title_page": "Better Life Programme for Rural Women", "text_new": "{{Short description|Project in Nigeria}}\n\nThe '''Better Life Programme for Rural Women''' or '''BLP''' was a project in Nigeria started in September 1987 by [[Maryam Babangida]], the wife of President [[Ibrahim Babangida]]. The programme was discontinued after a change in government. The idea of BLP originated at a workshop organized by Maryam Babangida with the scope of discussing relegation of rural women in discourse affecting national development and invisibility of positive actions towards causes favoring rural women. When the project started, the objectives were to reduce maternal and child mortality rate by increasing basic healthcare facilities for women, provide income-generating opportunities in agriculture and [[Small business|cottage industries]], integrate rural women into national development plans and develop educational training for women.\n\nHowever, the programme provoked criticism because funds allocated to many projects were unaccounted for largely because there was no budgetary allocation to fund BLP. Access to government funds by a first lady was challenged as unconstitutional and some critics view the project as a means to increase the personality of the first lady.<ref name=\"Amina\"/>\n\n==The Programme==\nPrior to the launch of Better Life, Maryam Babangida held consultations with various stakeholders such as the Directorate for Food and Rural Infrastructure and women organizations about economic and social constraints affecting rural women.

WHAM radio said in a statement that \"although Mr. Lonsberry expressed a willingness to change, it became obvious to us that he is not embracing diversity.\"<ref>(http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_18_104/ai_110076584).</ref>\n\nLonsberry was later fired from WHAM-AM for the remarks (but not from KNRS, both Clear Channel radio stations). When WHAM ratings in his time slot plunged, he was rehired following completion of sensitivity training. During his absence, many fans of his Rochester show boycotted the station and its sponsors until he was returned to the airwaves.\n\nOn June 16, 2010, Lonsberry was fired from [[KNRS-FM|KNRS]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], where he'd hosted show weekdays between 5 AM to 9 AM MT for a decade. In Lonsberry's daily web column, he indicated that the station attributed his firing to his lower listener ratings following the introduction of the [[Portable People Meter]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">http://lonsberry.com/writings.cfm?story=2895&go=4</ref> Lonsberry also suggests that his opposition to Republican primary candidate for US Senate, Mike Lee, a Utah-based attorney whose employer, a law firm whose clients includes one of KNRS's advertisers, may have been a factor in his firing. Lonsberry writes:\n\n:Of course, being suspicious is my stock-in-trade, and the timing of my termination and the stand I\u2019ve been taking on the looming senatorial primary and the fact I\u2019ve been opposing a candidate who made $600,000 from one of our largest advertisers last year, does make me wonder. Strings get pulled in the real world, and politics is hardball, and our program\u2019s effort helped tip the nominating convention, so it\u2019s not impossible that I lost my job in Salt Lake so that somebody else could get a job in Washington.<ref name=\"lonsberry.com\">http://www.lonsberry.com/writings.cfm?story=2895&go=4</ref>\n\nLonsberry vocally supported Mike Lee's primary-election opponent, Tim Bridgewater, a businessman and former Chairman of the Utah County Republican Party.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHQvcK19kIA</ref> The Bridgewater Campaign subsequently pulled all its ads from radio station KNRS.<ref>http://timbridgewater.com/2010/06/bridgewater-campaign-withdraws-ads-from-knrs/</ref>\n\nInterest in Lonsberry's firing from KNRS was high with over a thousand reader comments\u2014several times the normal response\u2014to Lonsberry's weekday blog.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Lonsberry fans also started a grassroots listener campaign with the objective of restoring Lonsberry to his position (www.bringbobbacktoutah.com).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bringbobbacktoutah.com |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621011322/http://www.bringbobbacktoutah.com/ |archivedate=2010-06-21 }}</ref> Lonsberry returned to the Utah airwaves in February 2011 on radio station [[KLO (AM)|KLO]] 1430AM.\n\nOn December 20, 2011, Lonsberry announced that he was doing his last morning broadcast on KLO due to an upcoming schedule change at WHAM. Lonsberry no longer broadcasts in the Utah radio market.\n\nWhile the content of Lonsberry's Rochester and Salt Lake City shows were politically and socially conservative, his approach in two broadcast markets differed due to local content and interests. The former Salt Lake City show was more genteel and included frequent religious references whereas the Rochester show is more raucous and occasionally risqu\u00e9.
