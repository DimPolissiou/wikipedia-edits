It's time to reimagine what we can collectively do for our global environment with activities and events.\n\nThe five components:\n* Citizen Science: Earth Day is leveraging Citizen Science and emerging technologies to engage one million global citizens in the 50th anniversary \u201cEarth Challenge 2020,\u201d collecting one billion data points to measure air quality, water quality, pollution and human health. This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100 million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks. EDN is also working with partners to plant 7.8 billion trees, one for every human who will live on the planet in 2020.   Combined, these volunteer activities will be the largest volunteer event in history. <ref>[https://www.earthday.org/campaigns/greatglobalcleanup/ Great Global CleanUp]</ref><ref>[https://www.earthday.org/earthday/countdown-to-2020 Earth Day 50th Anniversary]</ref><ref>[https://real-leaders.com/earth-day-take-part-in-the-biggest-volunteer-event-in-history/ Earth Day: Take Part in the Biggest Volunteer Event in History]</ref>\n* Education: Earth Day is building environmental and climate literacy worldwide. EDN will continue to work with teachers, students, innovators and thought leaders to educate and activate a new generation of environmental leaders around the world. \n* Events: Earth Day is now recognized worldwide as the planet's most significant civic engagement event each year. The 50th anniversary of Earth Day will be marked by tens of thousands of rallies and community events in every country in the world, and large-scale signature events to take place in Washington, D.C., and other global capitals.\n* Artists for the Earth: As Earth Day reaches its milestone 50th Anniversary in April 2020, nature and the environment are faced with enormous challenges from loss of biodiversity, pollution, degradation of our ecosystems, and climate change.

An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s are considered to start or separate the [[season]]s.\n\n[[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthsite.org |title=EarthSite |accessdate=April 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422193041/http://www.earthsite.org/ |archive-date=April 22, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> first introduced the idea of a global holiday called \"Earth Day\" at the 1969 [[UNESCO]] Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2013  }}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

It's time to reimagine what we can collectively do for our global environment with activities and events.\n\nThe five components:\n* Citizen Science: Earth Day is leveraging Citizen Science and emerging technologies to engage one million global citizens in the 50th anniversary \u201cEarth Challenge 2020,\u201d collecting one billion data points to measure air quality, water quality, pollution and human health. This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100 million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks. EDN is also working with partners to plant 7.8 billion trees, one for every human who will live on the planet in 2020.

EDN will continue to work with teachers, students, innovators and thought leaders to educate and activate a new generation of environmental leaders around the world. \n* Events: Earth Day is now recognized worldwide as the planet's most significant civic engagement event each year. The 50th anniversary of Earth Day will be marked by tens of thousands of rallies and community events in every country in the world, and large-scale signature events to take place in Washington, D.C., and other global capitals.\n* Artists for the Earth: As Earth Day reaches its milestone 50th Anniversary in April 2020, nature and the environment are faced with enormous challenges from loss of biodiversity, pollution, degradation of our ecosystems, and climate change.

An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year.

The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2013  }}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

Belonging to a financially poor family, he did not get the opportunity of an education.\n\n==Military career==\n[[Havildar]] Joginder Singh was enrolled in the [[Indian Army]] on 30 November 1940 at the young age of 18.

On the fateful day of 24th April 1956, Singh was leading a three jeep convoy carrying stores for a forward post at Phek, in the Naga Hills. After crossing milestone 16, insurgents who had set up traps on the curved mountainous track suddenly opened fire and charged the convoy with light machine guns. Havildar Joginder got hit by one of the bullets in his right leg. Undeterred by the gunshot, he jumped out of the jeep and ran towards the militants to attack. Following his brave act, six of his soldiers also braved out of the vehicles and moved forward to attack the militants. Havlidar Joginder was just 25 meters short of the enemy when a bullet hit him in the stomach. Undeterred once again, in spite of being deeply wounded he continued to move towards the enemy by crawling on the ground and finally hit the enemy\u2019s post by two hand grenades. This shot silenced the enemy fire and his fellow soldiers succeeded in destroying the enemy post which was always a hurdle for the movement of the Indian Army.
