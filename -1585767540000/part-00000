{"title_page": "Christian Hebraist", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nA '''Christian Hebraist''' is a [[Hebraist|scholar of Hebrew]] who comes from a [[Christianity|Christian]] family background/belief, or is a [[Jewish Christian|Jewish adherent of Christianity]]. The main area of study is that commonly known as the ''[[Old Testament]]'' to Christians (and ''[[Tanakh]]'' to Jews), but Christians have occasionally taken an interest in the ''[[Talmud]]'', and ''[[Kabbalah]]''.\n\nThe early fathers of the Christian Church got their knowledge of Hebrew traditions ([[Masoretic]], [[Midrashim]], [[Aggadah]]) from their Jewish teachers. This is seen especially in the [[exegesis]] of [[Justin Martyr]], [[Aphraates]], [[Ephraem Syrus]], and [[Origen of Alexandria]]. [[Jerome]]'s teachers are even mentioned by name\u2014e.g., Bar \u1e24anina (Hananiah).\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Middle Ages==\n[[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] have always been reading and using Hebrew texts. In [[western Christianity]], however, knowledge of Hebrew was historically scarce outside of converts from Judaism.<ref name=Grabois>Aryeh Grabois, \"Christian Hebraists\", in [[Joseph Strayer]] (ed.), ''The Dictionary of the Middle Ages'' (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1983), vol. 3, pp. 313\u201314.</ref> It has often been claimed that the [[Venerable Bede]] (d.735) knew something of Hebrew, but his knowledge appears to have been gleaned entirely from St [[Saint Jerome|Jerome]].<ref>E. F. Sutcliffe, \"The Venerable Bede's Knowledge of Hebrew\", ''Biblica'' '''16''' 3 (1935): 300\u201306.</ref> The same may be said of [[Alcuin]] (b. 735), who revised the Biblical translation of Jerome. The ninth-century [[Pseudo-Jerome]], who worked in the circle of [[Rabanus Maurus]] (d.856), had knowledge of Hebrew.<ref name=Grabois/>\n\nDuring the [[Twelfth-Century Renaissance]], contact between Christian and Jewish scholars increased. [[Peter Abelard]] (d.1142) recommended Christian scholars take up the language of the Old Testament and many followed this recommendation. The [[School of Saint Victor]] became the centre of Hebraism in western Europe. The [[Toledo School of Translators|school of Toledo]] also worked with Hebrew, but it was secondary to Arabic. [[Adam of Saint Victor]] (d.1146) was the most prominent Victorine Hebraist and his student, [[Herbert of Bosham]] (fl.1162\u201389), studied with [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] (d.c.1167) to acquire deeper grammatical understanding. The [[Cistercian]] tradition of Hebrew studies began with [[Nicholas Manjacoria]].<ref name=Grabois/>\n\nIn the thirteenth century, Hebrew learning declined among native Christians, while converts from Judaism mainly used their knowledge polemically against their co-ethnics. The tradition of scholarly Hebraism was strongest in England.<ref>The \"''Magister Andreas, natione Anglus''\" mentioned by [[Roger Bacon]], and identified by S. R. Hirsch with an [[Augustinian]] monk who lived about 1150, must at least have been able to read the [[Hebrew Bible|Bible in the Hebrew original]].</ref> Among the prominent English Hebraists were [[Alexander Neckham]] (d.1217); [[Stephen Langton]] (d.1228), who composed a Hebrew\u2013Latin dictionary of Biblical terms; [[William de la Mare]] (fl.1272\u201379), who was patronised by [[Robert Grosseteste]] (d.1253); and [[Roger Bacon]] (d.c.1292), who wrote  Hebrew grammar.<ref name=Grabois/>\n\nIn the fourteenth century, the [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] took up Hebrew, but their purpose was evangelical. They were instrumental, however, in setting up chairs of Hebrew in [[Medieval university|universities]] across Europe. The ecumenical [[Council of Vienne]] (1312) ordered chairs established at the universities of [[Sapienza University of Rome|Rome]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Paris|Paris]], [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]] and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]]. Paris had the leading Hebraist of the period in [[Nicholas of Lyra]] (d.1349), while following him was Bishop [[Paul of Burgos]] (d.1435), a Jewish convert.<ref name=Grabois/>\n\n==Renaissance==\nIt was not, however, until the end of the 15th century that the Renaissance and the Reformation, while awakening a new interest in the classics, brought about a return to the original text of Scripture and an attempt to understand the later literature of the Jews. [[Hieronymus Buslidius]], the friend of [[Erasmus]], gave more than 20,000 francs to establish a Hebrew chair at [[Leuven|Louvain]]; as the chair of Hebrew at the [[University of Paris]], Francis offered the chair to [[Elijah Levita]], the friend of Cardinal [[\u00c6gidius of Viterbo]], who declined to accept it. [[Cardinal Grimani]] and other dignitaries, both of the state and of the Church, studied Hebrew and the Cabala with Jewish teachers; even the warrior [[Guido Rangoni]] attempted the Hebrew language with the aid of [[Jacob Mantino]] (1526). [[Pico de la Mirandola]] (d. 1494) was the first to collect Hebrew manuscripts, and [[Reuchlin]] was the first to write a dictionary and short grammar of the Hebrew language (1506). A more detailed grammar was published by [[Otto Walper]] in 1590. But interest still centered wholly around the Bible and the expository literature immediately connected therewith.\n\nDuring the whole of the 16th century it was Hebrew grammar and Jewish exegesis that claimed attention. Christian scholars were not ashamed to be the students of Jewish teachers. In fact, one of the most noted Hebraists of this period was [[Immanuel Tremellius]] (1510-1580), born Jewish and converted first to Catholicism and soon thereafter became a Calvinist, producing the main Reformed translation of the Hebrew Bible into Latin (he also translated the New Testament from the Syriac into Latin). [[Sebastian M\u00fcnster]] (d. 1552) was known as a grammarian; [[Conrad Pellican|Pellicanus]] (d. 1556) and [[Xanthus Pagninius|Pagninius]] (d. 1541), as lexicographers; [[Daniel Bomberg]] (d. 1549), as a printer of Hebrew books. [[Arius Montanus]] (d. 1598) edited the [[Masoretic Text|Masorah]] and the ''Travels of Benjamin of Tudela''. Widmanstadt (1523), living in a colony of [[Spanish Jew]]ish refugees in [[Naples]], studied Hebrew with [[David ibn Ya'ya]] and [[Baruch of Benevento]], and collected the Hebrew manuscripts which formed the basis of the Hebrew division of the Royal Library at Munich. Vatabl\u00e9 (d. 1547) made use of [[Rashi]]'s commentary. [[Conrad Gesner]] (d. 1565) was the first Christian to compile a catalogue of Hebrew books; [[Jacob Christmann]] (d. 1613) busied himself with the Jewish calendar, and Drusius (d. 1616) with the ethical writings of the Jews.\n\n==17th century==\n\n[[Johannes Buxtorf]] (d. 1629) marks a turning-point in the study of Jewish literature by Christians. He not only studied the ''[[Targum]]'' and the ''Talmud'', but endeavored to understand Jewish history, and he was the first real bibliographer. Women showed an interest: [[Anna Maria Schurman]], the \"star of the century\", in the Dutch Republic; [[Dorothea Moore]] in England; [[Queen Christina of Sweden]] (d. 1689); [[Maria Dorothea]], consort of the [[Duke of Saxe-Weimar]]; [[Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine|Elizabeth]], daughter of [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick of the Palatinate]]; [[Maria Eleanora]], wife of [[Charles Ludwig of the Palatinate]]; Antonia, daughter of [[Duke Eberhard of W\u00fcrttemberg]].\n\nThrough Buxtorf a serious attempt was made to understand the post-Biblical literature, and many of the most important works were translated into Latin. In this connection the following names may be mentioned: [[Johannes Cocceius]] (d. 1667); [[Constantin L'Empereur]] (d. 1648); [[John Lightfoot]] (d. 1675); [[Johann Leusden]] (d. 1699); and especially [[Surenhuis]] (1698), who gave a complete translation of the ''[[Mishnah]]''; Jewish theology was studied by Carpzov (d. 1699), Wagenseil (1705; whose letters show how he gathered information), and [[Johann Stephan Rittangel]] (1641); antiquities, by [[Samuel Bochart]] (d. 1667), Hottinger (d. 1667), Hyde (d. 1700), [[Jacob Trigland (1652-1705)|Trigland]] (d. 1705), Breithaupt (1707), and [[Johann Jakob Schudt]] (d. 1722). It was a time in which the Christian theologian studied Hebrew and rabbinics before taking up his specific theological study. Hackspan (d. 1659) wrote upon the value to the theologian of studying the works of the Rabbis. Their writings on the Bible were read by Schickard (1635), [[Humphrey Hody]] (d. 1706), and [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] (d. 1712), while catalogues of Hebrew collections were published by Plantavitius (d. 1651), Le Long (d. 1721), and Montfaucon (d. 1741). Hottinger gave this literature a place in his ''Bibliotheca Orientalis''; Otho (1672) wrote a biographical lexicon of the Mishnah teachers; and Bartolocci's ''Bibliotheca Rabbinica'' (1675) was a worthy continuation of these bibliographical labors.\n\n==18th century==\n\nThe first half of the 18th century contains the names of three important scholars. [[Jacques Basnage]] knew no Hebrew, but his ''L'Histoire de la Religion des Juifs'' was the first attempt at a complete presentation of the history of Judaism. The ''Entdecktes Judenthum'' of [[Johann Andreas Eisenmenger|Eisenmenger]] (d.1704) exhibits a mass of Jewish learning. [[Johann Christoph Wolf]] (d. 1739), who, with the help of the Oppenheimer library, was able to produce his ''Bibliotheca Hebr\u00e6a'', which laid the foundation for all later works in Hebrew bibliography.\n\n[[Johann Christian Georg Bodenschatz]] (d. 1797), though not a scholarly Hebraist, gave an accurate account of Jewish ceremonials. By the side of these stand [[Bashuysen]] (d. 1750), the translator and printer of Hebrew books; [[Reland]] (d. 1718), the first to use Talmudic material for the study of the geography of Palestine; the bibliographers Unger (d. 1719) and Gagnier (d. 1720), who gave Wolf his information regarding the manuscripts in the Bodleian; J. H. Michaelis (d. 1738) and Mai (d. 1732), who compiled a catalogue of the [[Uffenbach library]]; Baratier (d. 1740), the youthful prodigy, who wrote on [[Benjamin of Tudela]]; Mill (d. 1756), who treated rabbinical exegesis; and W\u00e4hner (1762), who described Hebrew antiquities. [[Biagio Ugolini]] (1744) is said to have been a converted Jew, and therefore finds no place here. Special mention should be made of [[Ezra Stiles]], the learned president of [[Yale College]] (1778), certainly the most learned Christian student of post-Biblical Jewish literature that America has produced.\n\n==Early 19th century==\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century such friends of Hebrew literature became ever rarer. The rise of Biblical criticism and of the study of other [[Semitic language]]s engaged the whole interest of Semitic scholars.\n\nEven [[Johann Jacob Rabe|Rabe]], the translator of the ''[[Mishnah]]'' into German (d. 1798), [[Semmler]], [[Michaelis]], [[Tychsen]] (d. 1815), and [[Sylvestre de Sacy]] (d. 1838) can hardly be mentioned by the side of the humanists of previous centuries. Interest in the text of the Bible caused some work to be done in the collecting of Hebrew manuscripts, especially by [[Benjamin Kennicott]] in England (1776\u201380) and [[Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi]] in Italy (1784\u201388). The last-named made a valuable collection of Hebrew manuscripts; and by his side may be mentioned [[Joseph Pasinus]] (or Giuseppe Passini) in [[Turin]] (d. 1749), [[Antonio Maria Biscioni]] in [[Florence]] (d. 1752), [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani]] in Rome, and Ury in [[Oxford]] (d. 1787).\n\n==At the universities==\n{{POV section|date=December 2014}}\nThe downward trend continued in the first half of the 19th century; [[Jewish literature]] became less and less a subject of investigation by Christians; and when it was studied it was generally for the purpose of forging weapons against the people whose literature it was. This is seen in such works as [[A. T. Hartmann]]'s ''Thesaurus Lingu\u00e6 Hebr. c Mischna Augendi'' (1825), in Winer's ''Biblisches Real W\u00f6rterbuch'', and even in the works of Hitzig and Ewald. There was no understanding even of the period of [[Jewish history]] during which Christianity arose and developed; and [[David Strauss]]'s complaint in regard to this was only too well founded.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, however, the idea gained currency that there was something to be learned by going back to the sources of this history; but only a very few of the universities made a place for this study in their curricula. At the beginning of the 18th century [[David Rudolph (linguist)|David Rudolph]] of [[Liegnitz]] included ''Rabbinisch und Chald\u00e4isch'' among the Oriental languages which he taught at Heidelberg; but he had few imitators; and in the 19th century, apart from a few stray courses, such as [[Emil Kautzsch]]'s on [[David Kimhi|Kimhi]] at T\u00fcbingen, Lagarde's on [[Al-\u1e24arizi]] at [[G\u00f6ttingen]], and [[Strack]]'s on the ''[[Mishnah]]'' at Berlin, the whole of [[rabbinic literature]] was ignored by European universities.\n\nHonorable exceptions in this respect were furnished in the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (where A. Cowley was sublibrarian of the [[Bodleian Library]]) and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (which has produced such scholars as [[W. H. Lowe]], Matthews, and [[Charles Taylor (Hebraist)|Charles Taylor]]) in England, and in [[Columbia University]], the [[University of California]], the [[University of Chicago]], [[Harvard University]], and [[Johns Hopkins University]], in America. The Jews had been allowed to work out by themselves the new Jewish science (''J\u00fcdische Wissenschaft''), little attention being paid to that work by others.\n\nIn more recent times Christian scholars have given Jewish literature their attention. Abb\u00e9 [[Pietro Perreau]] has done good service by his many articles on the literature of the Jews in the [[Middle Ages]] and by the assistance he has given to scholars from the Hebrew manuscripts at [[Parma]]; [[Martin Hartmann]] has translated and commentated the \"Mete\u1e33 Sefatayim\" of [[Immanuel Frances]] (Berlin, 1894); [[Thomas Robinson (scholar)|Thomas Robinson]] has collected some good material in his ''The Evangelists and the Mishna'' (1859). [[August W\u00fcnsche]], in his \"Erl\u00e4uterung der Evangelien aus Midrasch und Talmud\" (1878), enlarged the scope of the inquiry begun by Lightfoot; and his translations from the ''[[Midrash]]'' opened up the stores of ancient Jewish exegesis. Weber's ''System der Altsynagogalen Palestinischen Theologie'' (1880) was, with all its failings, an honest attempt to understand the [[theology]] of the [[Synagogue]], followed by [[Wilhelm Bousset]] in his ''Religiondes Judenthums im Neutestamentlichen Zeitalter'' (1903). [[Dom Pedro II]], Emperor of Brazil, should also be mentioned for his publication of [[Occitan language|Proven\u00e7al]] Jewish poetry.\n\n==Late 19th century==\n\nThe [[Institutum Judaicum]] in [[Leipzig]], founded by [[Franz Delitzsch]], and a similar society bearing the same name in Berlin and founded by [[Hermann Strack]], have attempted, by their various publications, to diffuse in the Christian world a knowledge of Jewish writings. [[Gustav Dalman]] has shown by his philological works on Talmudic grammar and lexicography that he is at home in the rabbinic writings. Hermann Strack in Berlin demands special mention not only for his publications dealing with the literature of the Mishnah and the Talmud, but also on account of the fearless manner in which he has combated [[anti-semitism|anti-Semitic]] prejudice, drawing his material directly from the original sources. [[Carl Siegfried]], in his yearly reports in the ''Theologischer Jahresbericht'', for many years called attention to publications on Jewish subjects, and the mention of such works in the ''Orientalische Bibliographie'' has served to bring them more closely to the attention of Christian scholars. The roll of Christian Hebraists in England includes the names of J. W. Etheridge, the author of a popular ''Introduction to [post-Biblical] Hebrew Literature'' (1856); [[Thomas Chenery]], translator of ''Legends from the Midrash'' (1877), and editor of Al-\u1e24arizi's translation of \u1e24ariri; and [[W. H. Lowe]], who edited the Palestinian recension of the Mishnah.\n\nIn spite, however, of these facts and of the warning given by Lagarde (''Symmicta'', ii. 147; ''Mittheilungen'', ii. 165), that in order to understand the Bible text itself a deep study of the [[Halakah]] is necessary, Christian writers on the life of [[Jesus]] continue their disregard of the primary sources. This may be seen in Hausrath's ''Neutestamentliche Zeitgeschichte'' (''Kaufmann Gedenkbuch'', p.&nbsp;659), and even in Sch\u00fcrer (''Gesch.''), who, though making a great advance upon previous efforts, still relies upon second-hand sources for many of the pictures that he draws (see Abrahams in \"J. Q. R.\" xi. 628). [[Adolph Harnack]], who, in his ''Dogmengeschichte'' (3d ed.), endeavors to do some justice to the rabbis of old, in his ''Wesen des Christenthums'' (1900), sustains potential historical inaccuracies from a perhaps selective review of Jewish literature of the relevant period, possibly most noticeable in a lack of regard for the Jewish literature and history during the most recent eighteen hundred years.<ref>[[Felix Perles]], ''Was Lehrt Uns Harnack?' [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] (1902)</ref>\n\n==List of Christian Hebraists==\nThe following list of Christian Hebraists includes material taken from the Jewish Encyclopedia (1906), compiled upon the basis of Steinschneider's article mentioned in the bibliography below.

The main area of study is that commonly known as the ''[[Old Testament]]'' to Christians (and ''[[Tanakh]]'' to Jews), but Christians have occasionally taken an interest in the ''[[Talmud]]'', and ''[[Kabbalah]]''.\n\nThe early fathers of the Christian Church got their knowledge of Hebrew traditions ([[Masoretic]], [[Midrashim]], [[Aggadah]]) from their Jewish teachers. This is seen especially in the [[exegesis]] of [[Justin Martyr]], [[Aphraates]], [[Ephraem Syrus]], and [[Origen of Alexandria]]. [[Jerome]]'s teachers are even mentioned by name\u2014e.g., Bar \u1e24anina (Hananiah).\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Middle Ages==\n[[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]] have always been reading and using Hebrew texts. In [[western Christianity]], however, knowledge of Hebrew was historically scarce outside of converts from Judaism.<ref name=Grabois>Aryeh Grabois, \"Christian Hebraists\", in [[Joseph Strayer]] (ed.), ''The Dictionary of the Middle Ages'' (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1983), vol. 3, pp. 313\u201314.</ref> It has often been claimed that the [[Venerable Bede]] (d.735) knew something of Hebrew, but his knowledge appears to have been gleaned entirely from St [[Saint Jerome|Jerome]].<ref>E. F. Sutcliffe, \"The Venerable Bede's Knowledge of Hebrew\", ''Biblica'' '''16''' 3 (1935): 300\u201306.</ref> The same may be said of [[Alcuin]] (b. 735), who revised the Biblical translation of Jerome. The ninth-century [[Pseudo-Jerome]], who worked in the circle of [[Rabanus Maurus]] (d.856), had knowledge of Hebrew.<ref name=Grabois/>\n\nDuring the [[Twelfth-Century Renaissance]], contact between Christian and Jewish scholars increased. [[Peter Abelard]] (d.1142) recommended Christian scholars take up the language of the Old Testament and many followed this recommendation. The [[School of Saint Victor]] became the centre of Hebraism in western Europe. The [[Toledo School of Translators|school of Toledo]] also worked with Hebrew, but it was secondary to Arabic. [[Adam of Saint Victor]] (d.1146) was the most prominent Victorine Hebraist and his student, [[Herbert of Bosham]] (fl.1162\u201389), studied with [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] (d.c.1167) to acquire deeper grammatical understanding. The [[Cistercian]] tradition of Hebrew studies began with [[Nicholas Manjacoria]].<ref name=Grabois/>\n\nIn the thirteenth century, Hebrew learning declined among native Christians, while converts from Judaism mainly used their knowledge polemically against their co-ethnics. The tradition of scholarly Hebraism was strongest in England.<ref>The \"''Magister Andreas, natione Anglus''\" mentioned by [[Roger Bacon]], and identified by S. R. Hirsch with an [[Augustinian]] monk who lived about 1150, must at least have been able to read the [[Hebrew Bible|Bible in the Hebrew original]].</ref> Among the prominent English Hebraists were [[Alexander Neckham]] (d.1217); [[Stephen Langton]] (d.1228), who composed a Hebrew\u2013Latin dictionary of Biblical terms; [[William de la Mare]] (fl.1272\u201379), who was patronised by [[Robert Grosseteste]] (d.1253); and [[Roger Bacon]] (d.c.1292), who wrote  Hebrew grammar.<ref name=Grabois/>\n\nIn the fourteenth century, the [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] took up Hebrew, but their purpose was evangelical. They were instrumental, however, in setting up chairs of Hebrew in [[Medieval university|universities]] across Europe. The ecumenical [[Council of Vienne]] (1312) ordered chairs established at the universities of [[Sapienza University of Rome|Rome]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Paris|Paris]], [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]] and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]]. Paris had the leading Hebraist of the period in [[Nicholas of Lyra]] (d.1349), while following him was Bishop [[Paul of Burgos]] (d.1435), a Jewish convert.<ref name=Grabois/>\n\n==Renaissance==\nIt was not, however, until the end of the 15th century that the Renaissance and the Reformation, while awakening a new interest in the classics, brought about a return to the original text of Scripture and an attempt to understand the later literature of the Jews. [[Hieronymus Buslidius]], the friend of [[Erasmus]], gave more than 20,000 francs to establish a Hebrew chair at [[Leuven|Louvain]]; as the chair of Hebrew at the [[University of Paris]], Francis offered the chair to [[Elijah Levita]], the friend of Cardinal [[\u00c6gidius of Viterbo]], who declined to accept it. [[Cardinal Grimani]] and other dignitaries, both of the state and of the Church, studied Hebrew and the Cabala with Jewish teachers; even the warrior [[Guido Rangoni]] attempted the Hebrew language with the aid of [[Jacob Mantino]] (1526). [[Pico de la Mirandola]] (d. 1494) was the first to collect Hebrew manuscripts, and [[Reuchlin]] was the first to write a dictionary and short grammar of the Hebrew language (1506). A more detailed grammar was published by [[Otto Walper]] in 1590. But interest still centered wholly around the Bible and the expository literature immediately connected therewith.\n\nDuring the whole of the 16th century it was Hebrew grammar and Jewish exegesis that claimed attention. Christian scholars were not ashamed to be the students of Jewish teachers. In fact, one of the most noted Hebraists of this period was [[Immanuel Tremellius]] (1510-1580), born Jewish and converted first to Catholicism and soon thereafter became a Calvinist, producing the main Reformed translation of the Hebrew Bible into Latin (he also translated the New Testament from the Syriac into Latin). [[Sebastian M\u00fcnster]] (d. 1552) was known as a grammarian; [[Conrad Pellican|Pellicanus]] (d. 1556) and [[Xanthus Pagninius|Pagninius]] (d. 1541), as lexicographers; [[Daniel Bomberg]] (d. 1549), as a printer of Hebrew books. [[Arius Montanus]] (d. 1598) edited the [[Masoretic Text|Masorah]] and the ''Travels of Benjamin of Tudela''. Widmanstadt (1523), living in a colony of [[Spanish Jew]]ish refugees in [[Naples]], studied Hebrew with [[David ibn Ya'ya]] and [[Baruch of Benevento]], and collected the Hebrew manuscripts which formed the basis of the Hebrew division of the Royal Library at Munich. Vatabl\u00e9 (d. 1547) made use of [[Rashi]]'s commentary. [[Conrad Gesner]] (d. 1565) was the first Christian to compile a catalogue of Hebrew books; [[Jacob Christmann]] (d. 1613) busied himself with the Jewish calendar, and Drusius (d. 1616) with the ethical writings of the Jews.\n\n==17th century==\n\n[[Johannes Buxtorf]] (d. 1629) marks a turning-point in the study of Jewish literature by Christians. He not only studied the ''[[Targum]]'' and the ''Talmud'', but endeavored to understand Jewish history, and he was the first real bibliographer. Women showed an interest: [[Anna Maria Schurman]], the \"star of the century\", in the Dutch Republic; [[Dorothea Moore]] in England; [[Queen Christina of Sweden]] (d. 1689); [[Maria Dorothea]], consort of the [[Duke of Saxe-Weimar]]; [[Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine|Elizabeth]], daughter of [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick of the Palatinate]]; [[Maria Eleanora]], wife of [[Charles Ludwig of the Palatinate]]; Antonia, daughter of [[Duke Eberhard of W\u00fcrttemberg]].\n\nThrough Buxtorf a serious attempt was made to understand the post-Biblical literature, and many of the most important works were translated into Latin. In this connection the following names may be mentioned: [[Johannes Cocceius]] (d. 1667); [[Constantin L'Empereur]] (d. 1648); [[John Lightfoot]] (d. 1675); [[Johann Leusden]] (d. 1699); and especially [[Surenhuis]] (1698), who gave a complete translation of the ''[[Mishnah]]''; Jewish theology was studied by Carpzov (d. 1699), Wagenseil (1705; whose letters show how he gathered information), and [[Johann Stephan Rittangel]] (1641); antiquities, by [[Samuel Bochart]] (d. 1667), Hottinger (d. 1667), Hyde (d. 1700), [[Jacob Trigland (1652-1705)|Trigland]] (d. 1705), Breithaupt (1707), and [[Johann Jakob Schudt]] (d. 1722). It was a time in which the Christian theologian studied Hebrew and rabbinics before taking up his specific theological study. Hackspan (d. 1659) wrote upon the value to the theologian of studying the works of the Rabbis. Their writings on the Bible were read by Schickard (1635), [[Humphrey Hody]] (d. 1706), and [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] (d. 1712), while catalogues of Hebrew collections were published by Plantavitius (d. 1651), Le Long (d. 1721), and Montfaucon (d. 1741). Hottinger gave this literature a place in his ''Bibliotheca Orientalis''; Otho (1672) wrote a biographical lexicon of the Mishnah teachers; and Bartolocci's ''Bibliotheca Rabbinica'' (1675) was a worthy continuation of these bibliographical labors.\n\n==18th century==\n\nThe first half of the 18th century contains the names of three important scholars. [[Jacques Basnage]] knew no Hebrew, but his ''L'Histoire de la Religion des Juifs'' was the first attempt at a complete presentation of the history of Judaism. The ''Entdecktes Judenthum'' of [[Johann Andreas Eisenmenger|Eisenmenger]] (d.1704) exhibits a mass of Jewish learning. [[Johann Christoph Wolf]] (d. 1739), who, with the help of the Oppenheimer library, was able to produce his ''Bibliotheca Hebr\u00e6a'', which laid the foundation for all later works in Hebrew bibliography.\n\n[[Johann Christian Georg Bodenschatz]] (d. 1797), though not a scholarly Hebraist, gave an accurate account of Jewish ceremonials. By the side of these stand [[Bashuysen]] (d. 1750), the translator and printer of Hebrew books; [[Reland]] (d. 1718), the first to use Talmudic material for the study of the geography of Palestine; the bibliographers Unger (d. 1719) and Gagnier (d. 1720), who gave Wolf his information regarding the manuscripts in the Bodleian; J. H. Michaelis (d. 1738) and Mai (d. 1732), who compiled a catalogue of the [[Uffenbach library]]; Baratier (d. 1740), the youthful prodigy, who wrote on [[Benjamin of Tudela]]; Mill (d. 1756), who treated rabbinical exegesis; and W\u00e4hner (1762), who described Hebrew antiquities. [[Biagio Ugolini]] (1744) is said to have been a converted Jew, and therefore finds no place here. Special mention should be made of [[Ezra Stiles]], the learned president of [[Yale College]] (1778), certainly the most learned Christian student of post-Biblical Jewish literature that America has produced.\n\n==Early 19th century==\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century such friends of Hebrew literature became ever rarer. The rise of Biblical criticism and of the study of other [[Semitic language]]s engaged the whole interest of Semitic scholars.\n\nEven [[Johann Jacob Rabe|Rabe]], the translator of the ''[[Mishnah]]'' into German (d. 1798), [[Semmler]], [[Michaelis]], [[Tychsen]] (d. 1815), and [[Sylvestre de Sacy]] (d. 1838) can hardly be mentioned by the side of the humanists of previous centuries. Interest in the text of the Bible caused some work to be done in the collecting of Hebrew manuscripts, especially by [[Benjamin Kennicott]] in England (1776\u201380) and [[Giovanni Bernardo De Rossi]] in Italy (1784\u201388). The last-named made a valuable collection of Hebrew manuscripts; and by his side may be mentioned [[Joseph Pasinus]] (or Giuseppe Passini) in [[Turin]] (d. 1749), [[Antonio Maria Biscioni]] in [[Florence]] (d. 1752), [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani]] in Rome, and Ury in [[Oxford]] (d. 1787).\n\n==At the universities==\n{{POV section|date=December 2014}}\nThe downward trend continued in the first half of the 19th century; [[Jewish literature]] became less and less a subject of investigation by Christians; and when it was studied it was generally for the purpose of forging weapons against the people whose literature it was. This is seen in such works as [[A. T. Hartmann]]'s ''Thesaurus Lingu\u00e6 Hebr. c Mischna Augendi'' (1825), in Winer's ''Biblisches Real W\u00f6rterbuch'', and even in the works of Hitzig and Ewald. There was no understanding even of the period of [[Jewish history]] during which Christianity arose and developed; and [[David Strauss]]'s complaint in regard to this was only too well founded.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, however, the idea gained currency that there was something to be learned by going back to the sources of this history; but only a very few of the universities made a place for this study in their curricula. At the beginning of the 18th century [[David Rudolph (linguist)|David Rudolph]] of [[Liegnitz]] included ''Rabbinisch und Chald\u00e4isch'' among the Oriental languages which he taught at Heidelberg; but he had few imitators; and in the 19th century, apart from a few stray courses, such as [[Emil Kautzsch]]'s on [[David Kimhi|Kimhi]] at T\u00fcbingen, Lagarde's on [[Al-\u1e24arizi]] at [[G\u00f6ttingen]], and [[Strack]]'s on the ''[[Mishnah]]'' at Berlin, the whole of [[rabbinic literature]] was ignored by European universities.\n\nHonorable exceptions in this respect were furnished in the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] (where A. Cowley was sublibrarian of the [[Bodleian Library]]) and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (which has produced such scholars as [[W. H. Lowe]], Matthews, and [[Charles Taylor (Hebraist)|Charles Taylor]]) in England, and in [[Columbia University]], the [[University of California]], the [[University of Chicago]], [[Harvard University]], and [[Johns Hopkins University]], in America. The Jews had been allowed to work out by themselves the new Jewish science (''J\u00fcdische Wissenschaft''), little attention being paid to that work by others.\n\nIn more recent times Christian scholars have given Jewish literature their attention. Abb\u00e9 [[Pietro Perreau]] has done good service by his many articles on the literature of the Jews in the [[Middle Ages]] and by the assistance he has given to scholars from the Hebrew manuscripts at [[Parma]]; [[Martin Hartmann]] has translated and commentated the \"Mete\u1e33 Sefatayim\" of [[Immanuel Frances]] (Berlin, 1894); [[Thomas Robinson (scholar)|Thomas Robinson]] has collected some good material in his ''The Evangelists and the Mishna'' (1859). [[August W\u00fcnsche]], in his \"Erl\u00e4uterung der Evangelien aus Midrasch und Talmud\" (1878), enlarged the scope of the inquiry begun by Lightfoot; and his translations from the ''[[Midrash]]'' opened up the stores of ancient Jewish exegesis. Weber's ''System der Altsynagogalen Palestinischen Theologie'' (1880) was, with all its failings, an honest attempt to understand the [[theology]] of the [[Synagogue]], followed by [[Wilhelm Bousset]] in his ''Religiondes Judenthums im Neutestamentlichen Zeitalter'' (1903). [[Dom Pedro II]], Emperor of Brazil, should also be mentioned for his publication of [[Occitan language|Proven\u00e7al]] Jewish poetry.\n\n==Late 19th century==\n\nThe [[Institutum Judaicum]] in [[Leipzig]], founded by [[Franz Delitzsch]], and a similar society bearing the same name in Berlin and founded by [[Hermann Strack]], have attempted, by their various publications, to diffuse in the Christian world a knowledge of Jewish writings. [[Gustav Dalman]] has shown by his philological works on Talmudic grammar and lexicography that he is at home in the rabbinic writings. Hermann Strack in Berlin demands special mention not only for his publications dealing with the literature of the Mishnah and the Talmud, but also on account of the fearless manner in which he has combated [[anti-semitism|anti-Semitic]] prejudice, drawing his material directly from the original sources. [[Carl Siegfried]], in his yearly reports in the ''Theologischer Jahresbericht'', for many years called attention to publications on Jewish subjects, and the mention of such works in the ''Orientalische Bibliographie'' has served to bring them more closely to the attention of Christian scholars. The roll of Christian Hebraists in England includes the names of J. W. Etheridge, the author of a popular ''Introduction to [post-Biblical] Hebrew Literature'' (1856); [[Thomas Chenery]], translator of ''Legends from the Midrash'' (1877), and editor of Al-\u1e24arizi's translation of \u1e24ariri; and [[W. H. Lowe]], who edited the Palestinian recension of the Mishnah.\n\nIn spite, however, of these facts and of the warning given by Lagarde (''Symmicta'', ii. 147; ''Mittheilungen'', ii. 165), that in order to understand the Bible text itself a deep study of the [[Halakah]] is necessary, Christian writers on the life of [[Jesus]] continue their disregard of the primary sources. This may be seen in Hausrath's ''Neutestamentliche Zeitgeschichte'' (''Kaufmann Gedenkbuch'', p.&nbsp;659), and even in Sch\u00fcrer (''Gesch.''), who, though making a great advance upon previous efforts, still relies upon second-hand sources for many of the pictures that he draws (see Abrahams in \"J. Q. R.\" xi. 628). [[Adolph Harnack]], who, in his ''Dogmengeschichte'' (3d ed.), endeavors to do some justice to the rabbis of old, in his ''Wesen des Christenthums'' (1900), sustains potential historical inaccuracies from a perhaps selective review of Jewish literature of the relevant period, possibly most noticeable in a lack of regard for the Jewish literature and history during the most recent eighteen hundred years.<ref>[[Felix Perles]], ''Was Lehrt Uns Harnack?'

The character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 22 May 2000, played by an uncredited actor and originally referred to as Mark. From October onwards, he is played by [[Andrew Whyment]].\n\n==Storylines==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nKirk first appears when [[Tyrone Dobbs]] ([[Alan Halsall]]) mistakenly believes that he is [[Maria Connor|Maria]]'s ([[Samia Ghadie]]) boyfriend. Maria explains that Kirk is her brother. Kirk briefly leaves Weatherfield after the mistake, but shortly returns soon after. He goes for a drink with local resident [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve]] ([[Simon Gregson]]).\n\nKirk reappears after being kicked out of [[Rovers Return Inn|the Rovers]] by landlord [[Fred Elliott]] ([[John Savident]]), who believes him to be too young to drink. He is the older brother of Maria, with whom he owns Weatherfield Kennels. He is good friends with Tyrone and [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]) and an ex-boyfriend of [[Fiz Brown|Fiz Stape]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) whom he had met at a flat-decorating party. He is also friends with [[Les Battersby]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]), with whom he once lived, acting as best man at his wedding to [[Cilla Battersby-Brown|Cilla Brown]] ([[Wendi Peters]]). He also grew quite close to Cilla's son [[Chesney Brown|Chesney]] ([[Sam Aston]]) while he was with Fiz. Kirk dumps Fiz after he finds out that she had spent the night at her ex-boyfriend Tyrone's house.\n\nKirk meets Thelma Clegg, who hires him to shampoo her poodle. She is so impressed that she asks him to call round to her house regularly. Fiz is suspicious and follows Kirk to Thelma's house where she can see Kirk being entertained by Thelma belly-dancing in her living room. Kirk professes his innocence and says Thelma would not let him out of the house.\n\nKirk loses the kennels, following a lawsuit over the accidental [[neutering]] of a pedigree specimen, and within a week proposes to his girlfriend, Fiz. She dumps him immediately and tells him that she no longer wants to be with him. She leaves Kirk to be with her first love, [[John Stape]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]), leaving Kirk feeling broken and humiliated. Later that month, Kirk and [[Jamie Baldwin]] ([[Rupert Hill]]) rescue [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]), Kirk's next-door-neighbour from her burning house. As a reward, Claire's husband, [[Ashley Peacock|Ashley]] ([[Steven Arnold]]) gives Kirk a job at his butcher's shop. After Cilla receives \u00a345,000 for a necklace, she lets Kirk know first and leaves the street for [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Kirk is left to look after her son, Chesney. Kirk fails to provide adequate care for Chesney, and he is subsequently taken into [[foster care]]. When Fiz returns from a holiday, she is furious but forgives Kirk. She manages to get Chesney home but she has to move in with them, making Kirk believe she still has feelings for him.\n\nKirk leaves to visit his parents in [[Cyprus]] for several weeks. In the days leading up to his return, Fiz dreads him coming home, while she is providing a home for Chesney. On his return, he breaks the news that he has a new girlfriend called [[Julie Carp]] ([[Katy Cavanagh]]), whom he fell in love with in Cyprus. Fiz has taken a dislike to Julie, who then moved in with them at their house.\n\nKirk's nephew Paul Jr is stillborn and he consoles his grieving sister. His brother-in-law [[Liam Connor]] ([[Rob James-Collier]]) dies in a hit and run incident and his parents return to comfort their daughter over the loss of her husband. In November 2008, Kirk, Chesney and later Fiz visit Cilla in [[South Africa]], only to find she's up to her old tricks again. She enters a competition for $500,000 and Kirk poses as a mentally disabled boy, Chesney as a paralysed boy, Cilla's new \"Les\" as \"old\" Les and Fiz as a nun. While on a safari, Kirk saves them from a bush near wild animals. The \"family\" lose the competition when Chesney reveals Cilla's lies after she lied about 'returning' to Weatherfield. In March 2009, Julie admits she thinks she's pregnant but it turns out to be a false alarm. After this, Kirk begins to see that they are drifting apart, as they are too different, and he ends their relationship. However, Kirk supports Julie after the revelation that [[Colin Grimshaw]] ([[Edward DeSouza]]), [[Eileen Grimshaw|Eileen]]'s ([[Sue Cleaver]]) father, is also her father.\n\nKirk decides to move out of No. 5, as he feels he is in the way of Fiz's life. He packs his bags and leaves, only to turn up next door at Maria's. A few weeks later, he decides to pack and move in with Tyrone and [[Molly Dobbs|Molly]] ([[Vicky Binns]]). He then moves out and back into Maria's when she goes to stay in Ireland with the baby at Liam's parent's house after [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]) admits to having Liam killed.\n\nKirk applies for a job at ''Underworld'' as a machinist but ultimately loses out to [[Izzy Armstrong]] ([[Cherylee Houston]]). However, owner [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) offers him a job as a delivery driver. Kirk soon forms a strong friendship with Izzy, and as a result, his feelings for her grow stronger. When [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) is arrested for assaulting a lad who was hassling Izzy, Kirk makes a false statement to the police that it was him who committed the crime. As a result, Gary's military career is not put in jeopardy and this is a relief to Izzy, who has started to harbour feelings for Gary, much to Kirk's dismay.

The character first appeared on-screen during the episode airing on 22 May 2000, played by an uncredited actor and originally referred to as Mark. From October onwards, he is played by [[Andrew Whyment]].\n\n==Storylines==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nKirk first appears when [[Tyrone Dobbs]] ([[Alan Halsall]]) mistakenly believes that he is [[Maria Connor|Maria]]'s ([[Samia Ghadie]]) boyfriend. Maria explains that Kirk is her brother. Kirk briefly leaves Weatherfield after the mistake, but shortly returns soon after. He goes for a drink with local resident [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve]] ([[Simon Gregson]]).\n\nKirk reappears after being kicked out of [[Rovers Return Inn|the Rovers]] by landlord [[Fred Elliott]] ([[John Savident]]), who believes him to be too young to drink. He is the older brother of Maria, with whom he owns Weatherfield Kennels. He is good friends with Tyrone and [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]) and an ex-boyfriend of [[Fiz Brown|Fiz Stape]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) whom he had met at a flat-decorating party. He is also friends with [[Les Battersby]] ([[Bruce Jones (actor)|Bruce Jones]]), with whom he once lived, acting as best man at his wedding to [[Cilla Battersby-Brown|Cilla Brown]] ([[Wendi Peters]]). He also grew quite close to Cilla's son [[Chesney Brown|Chesney]] ([[Sam Aston]]) while he was with Fiz. Kirk dumps Fiz after he finds out that she had spent the night at her ex-boyfriend Tyrone's house.\n\nKirk meets Thelma Clegg, who hires him to shampoo her poodle. She is so impressed that she asks him to call round to her house regularly. Fiz is suspicious and follows Kirk to Thelma's house where she can see Kirk being entertained by Thelma belly-dancing in her living room. Kirk professes his innocence and says Thelma would not let him out of the house.\n\nKirk loses the kennels, following a lawsuit over the accidental [[neutering]] of a pedigree specimen, and within a week proposes to his girlfriend, Fiz. She dumps him immediately and tells him that she no longer wants to be with him. She leaves Kirk to be with her first love, [[John Stape]] ([[Graeme Hawley]]), leaving Kirk feeling broken and humiliated. Later that month, Kirk and [[Jamie Baldwin]] ([[Rupert Hill]]) rescue [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]), Kirk's next-door-neighbour from her burning house. As a reward, Claire's husband, [[Ashley Peacock|Ashley]] ([[Steven Arnold]]) gives Kirk a job at his butcher's shop. After Cilla receives \u00a345,000 for a necklace, she lets Kirk know first and leaves the street for [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Kirk is left to look after her son, Chesney. Kirk fails to provide adequate care for Chesney, and he is subsequently taken into [[foster care]]. When Fiz returns from a holiday, she is furious but forgives Kirk. She manages to get Chesney home but she has to move in with them, making Kirk believe she still has feelings for him.\n\nKirk leaves to visit his parents in [[Cyprus]] for several weeks. In the days leading up to his return, Fiz dreads him coming home, while she is providing a home for Chesney. On his return, he breaks the news that he has a new girlfriend called [[Julie Carp]] ([[Katy Cavanagh]]), whom he fell in love with in Cyprus. Fiz has taken a dislike to Julie, who then moved in with them at their house.\n\nKirk's nephew Paul Jr is stillborn and he consoles his grieving sister. His brother-in-law [[Liam Connor]] ([[Rob James-Collier]]) dies in a hit and run incident and his parents return to comfort their daughter over the loss of her husband. In November 2008, Kirk, Chesney and later Fiz visit Cilla in [[South Africa]], only to find she's up to her old tricks again. She enters a competition for $500,000 and Kirk poses as a mentally disabled boy, Chesney as a paralysed boy, Cilla's new \"Les\" as \"old\" Les and Fiz as a nun. While on a safari, Kirk saves them from a bush near wild animals. The \"family\" lose the competition when Chesney reveals Cilla's lies after she lied about 'returning' to Weatherfield. In March 2009, Julie admits she thinks she's pregnant but it turns out to be a false alarm. After this, Kirk begins to see that they are drifting apart, as they are too different, and he ends their relationship. However, Kirk supports Julie after the revelation that [[Colin Grimshaw]] ([[Edward DeSouza]]), [[Eileen Grimshaw|Eileen]]'s ([[Sue Cleaver]]) father, is also her father.\n\nKirk decides to move out of No. 5, as he feels he is in the way of Fiz's life. He packs his bags and leaves, only to turn up next door at Maria's. A few weeks later, he decides to pack and move in with Tyrone and [[Molly Dobbs|Molly]] ([[Vicky Binns]]). He then moves out and back into Maria's when she goes to stay in Ireland with the baby at Liam's parent's house after [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]) admits to having Liam killed.\n\nKirk applies for a job at ''Underworld'' as a machinist but ultimately loses out to [[Izzy Armstrong]] ([[Cherylee Houston]]). However, owner [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]) offers him a job as a delivery driver. Kirk soon forms a strong friendship with Izzy, and as a result, his feelings for her grow stronger. When [[Gary Windass]] ([[Mikey North]]) is arrested for assaulting a lad who was hassling Izzy, Kirk makes a false statement to the police that it was him who committed the crime. As a result, Gary's military career is not put in jeopardy and this is a relief to Izzy, who has started to harbour feelings for Gary, much to Kirk's dismay. The charges against Kirk are dropped to a lack of sufficient evidence, and he is a free man.\n\nKirk helps Tyrone come to terms with the fact that baby Jack is not his son as he and Maria visit him on Christmas Day. He is later kicked out along with Maria by a frustrated and angry Tyrone. Kirk attends [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]]'s ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) wedding renewal to [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Dawson]]) he arrives with Maria and her boyfriend [[Chris Gray (Coronation Street)|Chris Gray]] ([[Will Thorp]]) he informs Peter that everyone has arrived and that they can start the ceremony. Kirk, Tyrone, Gary, and Tommy abduct Leon Southam, whose girlfriend is harassing Fiz in prison. They hold him hostage in the empty butcher's shop and figure out how they will get out of it, only for Norris to find Leon and perform a citizen's arrest on him. Leon is sent back to jail for violating his parole and Norris is hailed as a hero, only for his fifteen minutes to expire immediately when a drunken Carla crashes into the bookies and almost kills [[Stella Price]] ([[Michelle Collins]]).\n\nIn July, Kirk is put in charge of helping colleague Michelle's son [[Ryan Connor]] ([[Sol Heras]]) in the packing department at ''Underworld'' as Michelle is punishing Ryan for an incident involving setting fire to [[Steve McDonald (Coronation Street)|Steve McDonald]]'s ([[Simon Gregson]]) house. While left alone, Ryan takes advantage and fakes a severe injury in order to take time off. Michelle and [[Rob Donovan]] ([[Marc Baylis]]) take Ryan to hospital, but no injuries are shown. However, later, Ryan announces that he plans to sue Underworld. Months later, Kirk meets [[Beth Tinker]] ([[Lisa George]]) and begins a relationship with her.

Those deemed \"unfit to reproduce\" often included people with [[Mental disabilites |mental]] or [[physical disabilities]], people who scored in the low ranges on different [[Iq tests |IQ tests]], criminals and \"deviants,\" and members of disfavored [[minority groups]].\n\nThe eugenics movement became associated with [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Holocaust]] when the defense of many of the defendants at the [[Nuremberg trials]] of 1945 to 1946 attempted to justify their [[human-rights]] abuses by claiming there was little difference between the [[Nazi eugenics]] programs and the [[Eugenics in the United States |U.S. eugenics]] programs.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics |first1= Alison |last1= Bashford |first2= Philippa |last2= Levine |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] | url= https://books.google.com/?id=g15rfXUA2i8C&pg=PA327&lpg=PA327&dq=eugenics+defense+nuremberg+trials#v=onepage&q=eugenics%20defense%20nuremberg%20trials&f=false |page= 327|isbn= 978-0199706532 |date= 2010-08-03 | access-date = 26 February 2020 | quote = Eugenics was prominent at the Nuremberg trials [...] much was made of the similarity between U.S. and German eugenics by the defense, who argued that German eugenics differed little from that practiced in the United States [...].}}</ref> In the decades following [[World War II]], with more emphasis on [[human rights]], many countries began to abandon eugenics policies, although some Western countries (the [[Compulsory sterilization#United States| United States]], [[Compulsory sterilization in Canada| Canada]], and [[Sweden]] among them) continued to carry out forced sterilizations.\n\nSince the 1980s and 1990s, with new [[assisted reproductive technology]] procedures available, such as [[gestational surrogacy]] (available since 1985), [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (available since 1989), and [[cytoplasmic transfer]] (first performed in 1996), concern has grown about the possible revival of a more potent form of eugenics after decades of promoting human rights.\n\nA criticism of eugenics policies is that, regardless of whether ''negative'' or ''positive'' policies are used, they are susceptible to abuse because the genetic selection criteria are determined by whichever group has [[political power]] at the time.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Furthermore, many criticize ''negative eugenics'' in particular as a violation of [[basic human rights]], seen since 1968's Proclamation of Tehran<ref>\n[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/l2ptichr.htm Proclamation of Tehran, Final Act of the International Conference on Human Rights, Teheran, 22 April to 13 May 1968, U.N.

This scenario would mean the return of coercive state-sponsored [[genetic discrimination]] and [[Human rights violations#Human rights violations|human rights violations]] such as [[compulsory sterilization]] of persons with genetic defects, the [[euthanasia|killing of the institutionalized]] and, specifically, [[racial segregation|segregation]] and [[genocide]] of [[Social interpretations of race|races]] perceived as inferior.{{sfn|Black|2003}} Health law professor [[George Annas]] and technology law professor [[Lori Andrews]] are prominent advocates of the position that the use of these technologies could lead to such human-[[posthuman]] [[caste]] warfare.<ref name=\"Darnovsky Crossroads\">{{cite web |last=Darnovsky |first=Marcy |title=Health and human rights leaders call for an international ban on species-altering procedures |date=2001 |url= http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=2809 |access-date=21 February 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Annas 2002\">{{cite journal |author-link=George Annas |last=Annas |first=George |author2-link=Lori Andrews |last2=Andrews |first2=Lori |author3-link=Rosario Isasi |last3=Isasi |first3=Rosario |title=Protecting the endangered human: Toward an international treaty prohibiting cloning and inheritable alterations |journal=American Journal of Law & Medicine |volume=28 |page=151 |date=2002}}</ref> According to eugenics advocate [[Richard Lynn]], the criticism of eugenics that \"it inevitably leads to measures that are unethical\" is a [[slippery slope]] argument.{{sfn|Lynn|2001|p=241|ps=, \"A number of the opponents of eugenics have resorted to the slippery slope argument, which states that although a number of eugenic measures are unobjectionable in themselves, they could lead to further measures that would be unethical.

He writes that it would be morally wrong for humans to tamper with fundamental aspects of themselves (or their children) in an attempt to overcome universal human limitations, such as vulnerability to [[aging]], [[maximum life span]] and biological constraints on physical and cognitive ability. Attempts to \"improve\" themselves through such manipulation would remove limitations that provide a necessary context for the experience of meaningful human choice. He claims that human lives would no longer seem [[Meaning of life|meaningful]] in a world where such limitations could be overcome with technology. Even the goal of using germinal choice technology for clearly therapeutic purposes should be relinquished, since it would inevitably produce temptations to tamper with such things as cognitive capacities. He argues that it is possible for societies to benefit from renouncing particular technologies, using as examples [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]], [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa Japan]] and the contemporary [[Amish]].<ref name=\"McKibben 2003\">{{cite book |last=McKibben |first=Bill |author-link=Bill McKibben |title=Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age |publisher=Times Books |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-8050-7096-5 |oclc=237794777}}</ref>\n\n====Endorsement====\nSome, for example [[Nathaniel C.

I shall not consider questions of eugenics, confining myself throughout to the traditional concerns of social justice. We should note, though, that it is not in general to the advantage of the less fortunate to propose policies which reduce the talents of others. Instead, by accepting the difference principle, they view the greater abilities as a social asset to be used for the common advantage. But it is also in the interest of each to have greater natural assets. This enables him to pursue a preferred plan of life. In the original position, then, the parties want to insure for their descendants the best genetic endowment (assuming their own to be fixed). The pursuit of reasonable policies in this regard is something that earlier generations owe to later ones, this being a question that arises between generations. Thus over time a society is to take steps at least to preserve the general level of natural abilities and to prevent the diffusion of serious defects.}}</ref> The [[Original position]], a hypothetical situation developed by Rawls, has been used as an argument for ''negative eugenics''.<ref>Shaw, p. 147. Quote: \"What Rawls says is that \"Over time a society is to take steps to preserve the general level of natural abilities and to prevent the diffusion of serious defects.\" The key words here are \"preserve\" and \"prevent\". Rawls clearly envisages only the use of negative eugenics as a preventive measure to ensure a good basic level of genetic health for future generations. To jump from this to \"make the later generations as genetically talented as possible,\" as Pence does, is a masterpiece of misinterpretation. This, then, is the sixth argument against positive eugenics: the Veil of Ignorance argument. Those behind the Veil in Rawls' Original Position would agree to permit negative, but not positive eugenics. This is a more complex variant of the Consent argument, as the Veil of Ignorance merely forces us to adopt a position of hypotethical consent to particular principles of justice.\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Harding |first=John R. |date=1991 |title=Beyond Abortion: Human Genetics and the New Eugenics |url= http://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1677&context=plr |journal=Pepperdine Law Review |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=489\u2013491 |access-date= 2016-06-02 |quote=Rawls arrives at the difference principle by considering how justice might be drawn from a hypothetical \"original position.' A person in the original position operates behind a \"veil of ignorance\" that prevents her from knowing any information about herself such as social status, physical or mental capabilities, or even her belief system. Only from such a position of universal equality can principles of justice be drawn. In establishing how to distribute social primary goods, for example, \"rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth\" and self-respect, Rawls determines that a person operating from the original position would develop two principles. First, liberties ascribed to each individual should be as extensive as possible without infringing upon the liberties of others. Second, social primary goods should be distributed to the greatest advantage of everyone and by mechanisms that allow equal opportunity to all. ... Genetic engineering should not be permitted merely for the enhancement of physical attractiveness because that would not benefit the least advantaged. Arguably, resources should be concentrated on genetic therapy to address disease and genetic defects. However, such a result is not required under Rawls' theory. Genetic enhancement of those already intellectually gifted, for example, might result in even greater benefit to the least advantaged as a result of the gifted individual's improved productivity. Moreover, Rawls asserts that using genetic engineering to prevent the most serious genetic defects is a matter of intergenerational justice.

In this period, people from across the political spectrum espoused eugenic ideas. Consequently, many countries adopted eugenic policies, intended to improve the quality of their populations' genetic stock. Such programs included both ''positive'' measures, such as encouraging individuals deemed particularly \"fit\" to reproduce, and ''negative'' measures, such as marriage prohibitions and [[forced sterilization]] of people deemed unfit for reproduction. Those deemed \"unfit to reproduce\" often included people with [[Mental disabilites |mental]] or [[physical disabilities]], people who scored in the low ranges on different [[Iq tests |IQ tests]], criminals and \"deviants,\" and members of disfavored [[minority groups]].\n\nThe eugenics movement became associated with [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Holocaust]] when the defense of many of the defendants at the [[Nuremberg trials]] of 1945 to 1946 attempted to justify their [[human-rights]] abuses by claiming there was little difference between the [[Nazi eugenics]] programs and the [[Eugenics in the United States |U.S. eugenics]] programs.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Oxford Handbook of the History of Eugenics |first1= Alison |last1= Bashford |first2= Philippa |last2= Levine |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] | url= https://books.google.com/?id=g15rfXUA2i8C&pg=PA327&lpg=PA327&dq=eugenics+defense+nuremberg+trials#v=onepage&q=eugenics%20defense%20nuremberg%20trials&f=false |page= 327|isbn= 978-0199706532 |date= 2010-08-03 | access-date = 26 February 2020 | quote = Eugenics was prominent at the Nuremberg trials [...] much was made of the similarity between U.S. and German eugenics by the defense, who argued that German eugenics differed little from that practiced in the United States [...].}}</ref> In the decades following [[World War II]], with more emphasis on [[human rights]], many countries began to abandon eugenics policies, although some Western countries (the [[Compulsory sterilization#United States| United States]], [[Compulsory sterilization in Canada| Canada]], and [[Sweden]] among them) continued to carry out forced sterilizations.\n\nSince the 1980s and 1990s, with new [[assisted reproductive technology]] procedures available, such as [[gestational surrogacy]] (available since 1985), [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (available since 1989), and [[cytoplasmic transfer]] (first performed in 1996), concern has grown about the possible revival of a more potent form of eugenics after decades of promoting human rights.\n\nA criticism of eugenics policies is that, regardless of whether ''negative'' or ''positive'' policies are used, they are susceptible to abuse because the genetic selection criteria are determined by whichever group has [[political power]] at the time.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Furthermore, many criticize ''negative eugenics'' in particular as a violation of [[basic human rights]], seen since 1968's Proclamation of Tehran<ref>\n[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/l2ptichr.htm Proclamation of Tehran, Final Act of the International Conference on Human Rights, Teheran, 22 April to 13 May 1968, U.N.

Another criticism is that eugenics policies eventually lead to a loss of [[genetic diversity]], thereby resulting in [[inbreeding depression]] due to a loss of genetic variation. Yet another criticism of contemporary eugenics policies is that they propose to permanently and artificially disrupt millions of years of evolution, and that attempting to create genetic lines \"clean\" of \"disorders\" can have far-reaching ancillary downstream effects in the [[genetic ecology]], including negative effects on [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] and on species [[Resilience (disambiguation)|resilience]].\n\n==History==\n{{Quote box\n |quote = We put down mad dogs; we kill the wild, untamed ox; we use the knife on sick sheep to stop their infecting the flock; we destroy abnormal offspring at birth; children, too, if they are born weak or deformed, we drown.

Quote: \"What Rawls says is that \"Over time a society is to take steps to preserve the general level of natural abilities and to prevent the diffusion of serious defects.\" The key words here are \"preserve\" and \"prevent\". Rawls clearly envisages only the use of negative eugenics as a preventive measure to ensure a good basic level of genetic health for future generations. To jump from this to \"make the later generations as genetically talented as possible,\" as Pence does, is a masterpiece of misinterpretation. This, then, is the sixth argument against positive eugenics: the Veil of Ignorance argument. Those behind the Veil in Rawls' Original Position would agree to permit negative, but not positive eugenics. This is a more complex variant of the Consent argument, as the Veil of Ignorance merely forces us to adopt a position of hypotethical consent to particular principles of justice.\"</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Harding |first=John R. |date=1991 |title=Beyond Abortion: Human Genetics and the New Eugenics |url= http://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1677&context=plr |journal=Pepperdine Law Review |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=489\u2013491 |access-date= 2016-06-02 |quote=Rawls arrives at the difference principle by considering how justice might be drawn from a hypothetical \"original position.' A person in the original position operates behind a \"veil of ignorance\" that prevents her from knowing any information about herself such as social status, physical or mental capabilities, or even her belief system. Only from such a position of universal equality can principles of justice be drawn. In establishing how to distribute social primary goods, for example, \"rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth\" and self-respect, Rawls determines that a person operating from the original position would develop two principles. First, liberties ascribed to each individual should be as extensive as possible without infringing upon the liberties of others. Second, social primary goods should be distributed to the greatest advantage of everyone and by mechanisms that allow equal opportunity to all. ... Genetic engineering should not be permitted merely for the enhancement of physical attractiveness because that would not benefit the least advantaged. Arguably, resources should be concentrated on genetic therapy to address disease and genetic defects. However, such a result is not required under Rawls' theory. Genetic enhancement of those already intellectually gifted, for example, might result in even greater benefit to the least advantaged as a result of the gifted individual's improved productivity. Moreover, Rawls asserts that using genetic engineering to prevent the most serious genetic defects is a matter of intergenerational justice.

{"title_page": "Ghost town", "text_new": "{{short description|City depopulated of inhabitants and that stays practically intact}}\n{{Other uses}}\n[[File:Plymouth Montserrat Heli.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Plymouth, Montserrat]] is the only ghost town that is the capital of a modern political territory.]]\nA '''ghost town''' or alternatively '''deserted city''' or '''abandoned city''' is an abandoned [[village]], [[town]], or [[city]], usually one that contains substantial visible remaining buildings and infrastructure such as roads. A town often becomes a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it (usually industrial or agricultural) has failed, or due to natural or human-caused disasters such as [[floods]], prolonged [[drought]]s, government actions, uncontrolled [[lawlessness]], [[war]], [[pollution]], or [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|nuclear disasters]]. The term can sometimes refer to cities, towns, and neighbourhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in past years; for example, those affected by high levels of unemployment and dereliction. Brody Winkler owned a town called Shitt's Creek, 3 years later it became a ghost town<ref name=Baker/>\n\nSome ghost towns, especially those that preserve period-specific architecture, have become tourist attractions. Some examples are [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]] in the United States, [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] in Canada, [[Craco]] in Italy, [[Kolmanskop]] in Namibia, [[Pripyat]] in Ukraine, and [[Danushkodi]] in India.\n\nThe town of [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]] on the Caribbean island of [[Montserrat]] is a ghost town that is the ''[[de jure]]'' [[Capital city|capital]] of Montserrat. It was rendered uninhabitable by volcanic ash from an eruption of the [[Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe definition of a ghost town varies between individuals, and between cultures. Some writers discount settlements that were abandoned as a result of a natural or human-made disaster or other causes using the term only to describe settlements that were deserted because they were no longer economically viable; T. Lindsey Baker, author of ''Ghost Towns of Texas'', defines a ghost town as \"a town for which the reason for being no longer exists\".<ref name=Baker>{{cite book |last=Baker |first= T. Lindsay |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Z4EFgxTW8oC&pg=PR9 |title=More Ghost Towns of Texas |year=2003 |location=Norman, OK |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=0806135182}}</ref> Some believe that any settlement with visible tangible remains should not be called a ghost town;<ref name=Rockies>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Robert L.|title=Ghost Towns of the Colorado Rockies|year=1990|publisher=Caxton Printers|location=Caldwell, Idaho|isbn=0870043420|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXOjzn5b-tAC&pg=PA15}}</ref> others say, conversely, that a ghost town should contain the tangible remains of buildings.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thomsen |first=Clint |year=2012 |title=Ghost Towns: Lost Cities of the Old West |publisher=Osprey Publishing |chapter=What is a ghost town? |isbn=1782001077}}</ref> Whether or not the settlement must be completely deserted, or may contain a small population, is also a matter for debate.<ref name=Rockies/> Generally, though, the term is used in a looser sense, encompassing any and all of these definitions. American author Lambert Florin's defined a ghost town as \"a shadowy semblance of a former self\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Shawn|title=Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of Southern Nevada|year=2010|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=0738570125|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHLCS4HNjuQC&pg=PA7}}</ref>\n\n==Reasons for abandonment==\nFactors leading to the abandonment of towns include depleted natural resources, economic activity shifting elsewhere, railroads and roads bypassing or no longer accessing the town, human intervention, disasters, massacres, wars, and the shifting of politics or fall of empires.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Graves |first1=Philip |last2=Weiler |first2=Stephan |last3=Tynon |first3=Emily |ssrn=1540770 |title=The Economics of Ghost Towns|publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=25 January 2010}}</ref> A town can also be abandoned when it is part of an [[exclusion zone]] due to [[Plymouth, Montserrat|natural]] or [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|man-made causes]].\n\n===Economic activity shifting elsewhere===\n[[File:Abandoned farmhouse, overgrown.jpg|thumb|right|As farms [[Intensive farming|industrialize]], smaller farms are no longer economically viable, leading to rural decay.]]\n\nGhost towns may result when the single activity or resource that created a [[boomtown]] (e.g., nearby mine, mill or resort) is depleted or the resource economy undergoes a \"bust\" (e.g., catastrophic resource price collapse). Boomtowns can often decrease in size as fast as they initially grew. Sometimes, all or nearly the entire population can desert the town, resulting in a ghost town.\n\nThe dismantling of a boomtown can often occur on a planned basis. Mining companies nowadays will create a temporary community to service a mine site, building all the accommodation, shops and services required, and then remove them once the resource has been extracted. Modular buildings can be used to facilitate the process. A [[gold rush]] would often bring intensive but short-lived economic activity to a remote village, only to leave a ghost town once the resource was depleted.\n\nIn some cases, multiple factors may remove the economic basis for a community; some former [[mining town]]s on [[U.S. Route 66]] suffered both mine closures when the resources were depleted and loss of highway traffic as US 66 was diverted away from places like [[Oatman, Arizona]] onto a more direct path. Mine and pulp mill closures have led to many ghost towns in British Columbia, Canada including several relatively recent ones: [[Ocean Falls]] which closed in 1973 after the pulp mill was decommissioned, [[Kitsault]] B.C. whose molybdenum mine shut down after only 18 months in 1982, and [[Cassiar, British Columbia|Cassiar]] whose asbestos mine operated from 1952 to 1992.\n\nIn other cases, the reason for abandonment can arise from a town's intended economic function shifting to another, nearby place. This happened to [[Collingwood, Queensland]] in [[Outback]] [[Australia]] when nearby [[Winton, Queensland|Winton]] outperformed Collingwood as a regional centre for the livestock-raising industry. The railway reached Winton in 1899, linking it with the rest of [[Queensland]], and Collingwood was a ghost town by the following year.\n\nThe Middle East has many ghost towns that were created when the shifting of politics or the fall of empires caused capital cities to be socially or economically unviable, such as [[Ctesiphon]].\n\nThe rise of condominium investment and a resulting real estate bubble may also lead to a ghost town, as real estate prices rise and affordable housing becomes less available. Such examples include China and Canada, where housing is often used as an investment rather than for habitation.<!---What does that first clause mean?--->\n\n===Human intervention===\n[[File:Famagusta-Varosha 2007.JPG|thumb|Prior to the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, [[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha]], now falling into ruin, once was a modern tourist area.]]\n[[File:Akarmaraghosttown.jpg|thumb|[[Akarmara]], a [[mining town]] in [[Abkhazia]]/[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], was abandoned in the early 1990s due to the [[War in Abkhazia (1992\u201393)|War in Abkhazia]].]]\nRailroads and roads bypassing or no longer reaching a town can also create a ghost town. This was the case in many of the ghost towns along Ontario's historic [[Opeongo Line]], and along [[U.S. Route 66]] after motorists bypassed the latter on the faster moving highways [[Interstate 44|I-44]] and [[Interstate 40|I-40]]. Some ghost towns were founded along railways where [[steam train]]s would stop at periodic intervals to take on water. [[Amboy, California]] was part of one such series of villages along the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] across the [[Mojave Desert]].\n\nRiver re-routing is another factor, one example being the towns along the [[Aral Sea]].\n\nGhost towns may be created when land is [[eminent domain|expropriated]] by a government, and residents are required to relocate. One example is the village of [[Tyneham]] in [[Dorset]], England, acquired during World War II to build an artillery range.\n\nA similar situation occurred in the U.S. when [[NASA]] acquired land to construct the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] (SSC), a rocket testing facility in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] (on the Mississippi side of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi\u2013Louisiana)|Pearl River]], which is the [[Mississippi]]\u2013[[Louisiana]] state line). This required NASA to acquire a large (approximately {{convert|34|sqmi|adj=on}}) [[buffer zone]] because of the loud noise and potential dangers associated with testing such rockets. Five thinly populated rural Mississippi communities (Gainesville, Logtown, Napoleon, Santa Rosa, and Westonia), plus the northern portion of a sixth ([[Pearlington, Mississippi|Pearlington]]), along with 700 families in residence, had to be completely relocated away from the facility.\n\nSometimes the town might cease to officially exist, but the physical infrastructure remains. For example, the five Mississippi communities that had to be abandoned to build SSC still have remnants of those communities within the facility itself. These include city streets, now overgrown with forest flora and fauna, and a one-room schoolhouse. Another example of infrastructure remaining is the former town of [[Weston, DuPage County, Illinois|Weston, Illinois]], that voted itself out of existence and turned the land over for construction of the [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]. Many houses and even a few barns remain, used for housing visiting scientists and storing maintenance equipment, while roads that used to cross through the site have been blocked off at the edges of the property, with gatehouses or barricades to prevent unsupervised access.\n\n====Flooding by dams====\nConstruction of dams has produced ghost towns that have been left underwater. Examples include the settlement of [[Loyston, Tennessee]], U.S., inundated by the creation of [[Norris Dam]]. The town was reorganised and reconstructed on nearby higher ground. Other examples are [[The Lost Villages]] of [[Ontario]] flooded by [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] construction in 1958, the hamlets of [[Nether Hambleton]] and [[Middle Hambleton]] in [[Rutland]], England, which were flooded to create [[Rutland Water]], and the villages of [[Ashopton]] and [[Derwent, Derbyshire|Derwent]], England, flooded during the construction of the [[Ladybower Reservoir]]. [[Mologa]] in Russia was flooded by the creation of [[Rybinsk reservoir]], and in France the [[Tignes Dam]] flooded the village of Tignes, displacing 78 families.{{Citation needed|reason=The wiki page for this dam does not mention and therefore does not cite the number of displaced families|date=June 2019}} Many ancient villages had to be abandoned during construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, leading to the displacement of many rural people. In the Costa Rican province of Guanacaste, the town of [[Lake Arenal|Arenal]] was rebuilt to make room for the man-made [[Lake Arenal]]. The old town now lies submerged below the lake. [[Old Adaminaby]] was flooded by a dam of the [[Snowy River Scheme]]. Construction of the [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]] on the [[Nile River]] in Egypt submerged archaeological sites and ancient settlements such as [[Buhen]] under [[Lake Nasser]]. Another example of towns left underwater is [[Tehri]]; by the construction of the [[Tehri Dam]] in the Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]].\n\n====Massacres====\nSome towns become deserted when their populations are [[massacre]]d. The original French village at [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] was destroyed on [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|10 June 1944]] when 642 of its 663 inhabitants were killed by a German [[Waffen-SS]] company. A new village was built after the war on a nearby site, and the ruins of the original have been maintained as a memorial.\n\n===Disasters, actual and anticipated===\n[[File:Craco0001.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Craco]], Italy, was abandoned due to a landslide in 1963. Now it is a popular film set.]]\nNatural and man-made disasters can create ghost towns. For example, after being flooded more than 30 times since their town was founded in 1845, residents of [[Pattonsburg, Missouri]], decided to relocate after two floods in 1993. With government help, the whole town was rebuilt {{convert|3|mi}} away.\n\n[[Craco]], a medieval village in the Italian region of [[Basilicata]], was evacuated after a landslide in 1963. Nowadays it is a famous filming location for many movies, including ''[[The Passion of The Christ]]'' by [[Mel Gibson]], ''[[Christ Stopped at Eboli (film)|Christ Stopped at Eboli]]'' by [[Francesco Rosi]], ''[[The Nativity Story]]'' by [[Catherine Hardwicke]] and ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' by [[Marc Forster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Craco,%20Matera,%20Basilicata,%20Italy&ref_=ttloc_loc_14|title=Most Popular Titles With Location Matching \"Craco, Matera, Basilicata, Italy\"|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] was abandoned due to an uncontainable [[mine fire]], which began in 1962 and still rages to this day; eventually the fire reached an abandoned mine underneath the nearby town of [[Byrnesville, Pennsylvania]], which caused that mine to catch on fire too and forced the evacuation of that town as well.\n\n[[File:Pripyat-today.jpg|thumb|[[Prypiat|Pripyat]], Ukraine, was abandoned after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].]]\nGhost towns may also occasionally come into being due to an ''anticipated'' natural disaster \u2013 for example, the Canadian town of [[Lemieux, Ontario]] was abandoned in 1991 after soil testing revealed that the community was built on an unstable bed of [[Leda clay]]. Two years after the last building in Lemieux was demolished, a landslide swept part of the former town-site into the [[South Nation River]]. Two decades earlier, the Canadian town of [[Saint-Jean-Vianney, Quebec|Saint-Jean-Vianney]], Qu\u00e9bec, also constructed on a Leda clay base, had been abandoned after a landslide on 4 May 1971, which swept away 41 homes, killing 31 people.\n\nFollowing the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, dangerously high levels of nuclear contamination escaped into the surrounding area, and nearly 200 towns and villages in [[Ukraine]] and neighbouring [[Belarus]] were evacuated, including the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]]. The area was so contaminated that many of the evacuees were never permitted to return to their homes. Pripyat is the most famous of these abandoned towns; it was built for the workers of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and had a population of almost 50,000 at the time of the disaster.<ref name=chernobyl>{{cite book|last=Mould|first=R.

It was destroyed during the [[1964 Rameswaram cyclone]] and remains uninhabited in the aftermath.\n\nMany abandoned towns and settlements in the former [[Soviet Union]] were established near [[Gulag]] concentration camps to supply necessary services. Since most of these camps were abandoned in the 1950s, the towns were abandoned as well. One such town is located near the former Gulag camp called [[Butugychag]] (also called Lower Butugychag). Other towns were deserted due to deindustrialisation and the economic crises of the early 1990s attributed to [[post-Soviet conflicts]] \u2013 one example being [[Tkvarcheli]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], a coal mining town that suffered a drastic population decline as a result of the [[War in Abkhazia (1992\u20131993)|War in Abkhazia]] in the early 1990s.\n\n'''INDIA'''\n\n'''[[Dhanushkodi|Dhanuskodi]]''' is an abondened town situated in the south-eastern tip of Pambam Island of the state of Tamil Nadu in India.

It is estimated that around 1,800 people died in that cyclonic storm including 115 passengers on board the Pambam-Dhanuskodi passenger train. The entire city was marooned and the Government of Madras declared Dhanuskodi as a ghost town, unfit for living\n\n'''[[Old Goa]]''' or '''VELHA GOA''' is a historical city which was constructed by Bijapur Sultanate in the 15<sup>th</sup> century and the city also served as the capital of Portuguese India from the 16<sup>th</sup> century. The city is located in the North Goa district in the Indian state of Goa. It was abondened during the 18<sup>th</sup> century\u00a0 due to plague, before the plague the city was used by the Portuguese for trade across the continent. The remains of the city are a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n===Antarctica===\n[[File:Deception-Base.jpg|thumb|The derelict British base in Whalers Bay, [[Deception Island]], destroyed by a volcanic eruption]]\nThe oldest ghost town in [[Antarctica]] is on [[Deception Island]], where in 1906, a Norwegian-Chilean company set up a whaling station at Whalers Bay, which they used as a base for their factory ship, the ''Gobernador Bories''. Other whaling operations followed suit, and by 1914 there were thirteen factory ships based there. The station ceased to be profitable during the [[Great Depression]], and was abandoned in 1931. In 1969, the station was partially destroyed by a volcanic eruption. There are also many abandoned scientific and military bases in Antarctica, especially in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].\n\nThe Antarctic island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] used to have several thriving whaling settlements during the first half of the 20th century, with a combined population exceeding 2,000 in some years. These included [[Grytviken]] (operating 1904-64), [[Leith Harbour]] (1909\u201365), [[Ocean Harbour]] (1909\u201320), [[Husvik]] (1910\u201360), [[Stromness (South Georgia)|Stromness]] (1912\u201361) and [[Prince Olav Harbour]] (1917\u201334). The abandoned settlements have become increasingly dilapidated, and remain uninhabited nowadays except for the Museum curator's family at Grytviken. The jetty, the church, dwellings and industrial buildings at Grytviken have recently been renovated by the South Georgian Government, becoming a popular tourist destination. Some historical buildings in the other settlements are being restored as well.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Oradour-sur-Glane-Streets-1294.jpg|thumb|Main street of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]], France, unchanged since the German massacre.]]\n[[Urbanization]] \u2013 the migration of a country's rural population into the cities \u2013 has left many European towns and villages deserted.

The first village officially declared as \"dead\" was [[:hu:Gy\u0171r\u0171f\u0171|Gy\u0171r\u0171f\u0171]] in the late 1970s, but later it was repopulated as an eco-village. Some other depopulated villages were successfully saved as small rural resorts, such as [[K\u00e1n, Hungary|K\u00e1n]], [[Tornak\u00e1polna]], [[Szanticska]], [[Gorica, Hungary|Gorica]], and [[R\u00e9vfalu]].\n\nIn Spain, large zones of the mountainous [[Iberian System]] and the [[Pyrenees]] have undergone heavy depopulation since the early 20th century, leaving a string of ghost towns in areas such as the [[Solana Valley]]. Traditional agricultural practices such as sheep and goat rearing, on which the mountain village economy was based, were not taken over by the local youth, especially after the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |title=Sos Mundo Rural Aragon\u00e9s alerta de la despoblaci\u00f3n de los pueblos |publisher=Diario de Teruel |language=Spanish |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315150215/http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |archive-date=15 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, thousands of villages were abandoned during the Middle Ages, as a result of [[Black Death]], climate change, revolts, and [[enclosure]], the process by which vast amounts of farmland became privately owned. Since there are rarely any visible remains of these settlements, they are not generally considered ghost towns; instead, they are referred to in archaeological circles as [[deserted medieval village]]s.\n\nSometimes, wars and genocide end a town's life. In 1944, occupying German Waffen-SS troops murdered almost the entire population of the French village [[Oradour-sur-Glane]]. A new settlement was built nearby after the war, but the old town was left depopulated on the orders of President [[Charles de Gaulle]], as a permanent memorial. In Germany, numerous smaller towns and villages in the [[former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories]] were completely destroyed in the last two years of the war. These territories later became part of [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and many of the smaller settlements were never rebuilt or repopulated, for example [[K\u0142omino]] (''Westfalenhof''), [[Pstr\u0105\u017ce]] (''Pstransse''), and [[Janowa G\u00f3ra]] (''Johannesberg''). Some villages in England were also abandoned during the war, but for different reasons. [[Imber]], on [[Salisbury Plain]], and  several villages in the [[Stanford Battle Area]], were commandeered by the [[War Office]] for use as training grounds for British and US troops. Although this was intended to be a temporary measure, the residents were never allowed to return, and the villages have been used for military training ever since. Three miles southeast of Imber is [[Copehill Down]], a deserted village purpose-built for training in [[urban warfare]].\n\nDisasters have played a part in the abandonment of settlements within Europe. After the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]] were evacuated due to dangerous radiation levels within the area. As of today, Pripyat remains completely abandoned, and Chernobyl has around 500 remaining inhabitants.\n\n===North America===\n[[File:RobsartHospital.jpg|thumb|[[Robsart Hospital]], one of many abandoned buildings in [[Robsart, Saskatchewan]]]]\n\n====Canada====\n{{See also|Lists of ghost towns in Canada}}\nThere are ghost towns in parts of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and [[Quebec]]. Some were logging towns or dual mining and logging sites, often [[company town|developed at the behest of the company]]. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, most ghost towns were once farming communities that have since died off due to the removal of the railway through the town or the bypass of a highway. The ghost towns in British Columbia were predominantly mining towns and prospecting camps as well as canneries and, in one or two cases, large smelter and pulp mill towns. British Columbia has more ghost towns than any other jurisdiction on the North American continent, with one estimate at the number of abandoned and semi-abandoned towns and localities upwards of 1500.<ref>Ramsey, Bruce (1963-1975). ''Ghost Towns of British Columbia\". Vancouver: Mitchell Press.</ref> Among the most notable are [[Anyox]], [[Kitsault]], and [[Ocean Falls]].\n\nSome ghost towns have revived their economies and populations due to historical and eco-tourism, such as [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]]. Barkerville, once the largest town north of [[Kamloops]], is now a year-round provincial museum. In Quebec, [[Val-Jalbert, Quebec|Val-Jalbert]] is a well-known tourist ghost town; founded in 1901 around a mechanical [[pulp mill]] that became obsolete when [[paper mill]]s began to break down [[wood fibre]] by chemical means, it was abandoned when the mill closed in 1927 and re-opened as a park in 1960.\n{{clear left}}\n\n====United States====\n{{See also|List of ghost towns in the United States}}\n[[File:A363, Rhyolite, Nevada, USA, John S Cook and Company building, 2004.jpg|thumb|Cook Bank building in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]], a gold mining town]]\nMany ghost towns or abandoned [[unincorporated area|communities]] exist in the American [[Great Plains]], the rural areas of which have lost a third of their population since 1920. Thousands of communities in the northern plains states of [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]] became railroad ghost towns when a rail line failed to materialize. Hundreds of towns were abandoned when the [[Interstate highway system]] replaced the railroads as the favored mode of travel. Ghost towns are common in mining or [[mill town]]s in all the western states, and many eastern and southern states as well. Residents are compelled to leave in search of more productive areas when the resources that had created an employment boom in these towns were eventually consumed. Some unincorporated towns become ghost towns due to flooding caused by dam projects that created man{{endash}}made lakes, such as [[Oketeyeconne, Georgia|Oketeyeconne]].\n\nSometimes a ghost town consists of many abandoned buildings as in [[Bodie, California]], or standing ruins as in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]], while elsewhere only the foundations of former buildings remain as in [[Graysonia, Arkansas]]. Old mining camps that have lost most of their population at some stage of their history such as [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Oatman, Arizona|Oatman]], [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] and [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]] are sometimes referred to as ghost towns although they are presently active towns and cities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Many U.S. ghost towns, such as [[South Pass City, Wyoming|South Pass City in Wyoming]]<ref>Weis, Norman D.

In 1590, mapmaker [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] arrived at the [[Roanoke Colony]], North Carolina to find it deserted, its inhabitants having vanished without a trace. The [[Zwaanendael Colony]] became a ghost town when every one of the colonists was massacred by Indians in 1632.

Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system. Since the 1930s, many rural workers have moved to the big cities. Other ghost towns were created in the aftermath of dinosaur fossil rushes.\n\nA number of ghost towns throughout South America were once mining camps or lumber mills, such as the many [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] mining camps that prospered in Chile from the end of the [[War of the Pacific|Saltpeter War]] until the invention of synthetic saltpeter during World War I. Some of these towns, such as the [[Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works]] in the [[Atacama Desert]], have been declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s. Another former mining town, [[Real de Catorce]] in Mexico, has been used as a backdrop for Hollywood movies such as ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), ''[[The Mexican]]'' (2001), and ''[[Bandidas]]'' (2006).\n\n===Oceania===\nThe boom and bust of gold rushes and the mining of other ores has led to a number of ghost towns in both Australia and New Zealand. Other towns have become abandoned whether due to natural disasters, the weather, or the drowning of valleys to increase the size of lakes.\n\nIn Australia, the [[Victoria gold rush]] led to numerous ghost towns (such as [[Cassilis, Victoria|Cassilis]] and [[Moliagul]]), as did the hunt for gold in [[Western Australia]] (for example, the towns of [[Ora Banda]] and [[Kanowna, Western Australia|Kanowna]]). The mining of iron and other ores has also led to towns thriving briefly before dwindling. \n\nIn New Zealand, the [[Otago gold rush]] similarly led to several ghost towns (such as [[Macetown]]). New Zealand's ghost towns also include numerous coal mining areas in the South Island's [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast Region]], including [[Denniston, New Zealand|Denniston]] and [[Stockton, New Zealand|Stockton]]. Natural disasters have also led to the loss of some towns, notably [[Te Wairoa (village)|Te Wairoa]], \"The Buried Village\", destroyed in the [[1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera]], and the Otago town of [[Kelso, New Zealand|Kelso]], abandoned after it was flooded repeatedly after heavy rainstorms. Early settlements on the rugged southwest coast of the South Island at [[Martins Bay]] and [[Port Craig]] were also abandoned, mainly due to the inhospitable terrain.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Abandoned mine#Abandoned mines|Abandoned mine]]\n*[[Abandoned village]]\n*[[Exclusion zone]]\n*[[List of ghost towns by country]]\n*[[Modern ruins]]\n*[[Old field (ecology)]]\n*[[Phantom settlement]]\n*[[Unused highway]]\n*[[Urban decay]]\n*[[Urban exploration]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- This section holds references that are cited by this article -->\n*{{cite book|last=Baker|first=T.

A town often becomes a ghost town because the economic activity that supported it (usually industrial or agricultural) has failed, or due to natural or human-caused disasters such as [[floods]], prolonged [[drought]]s, government actions, uncontrolled [[lawlessness]], [[war]], [[pollution]], or [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|nuclear disasters]]. The term can sometimes refer to cities, towns, and neighbourhoods that are still populated, but significantly less so than in past years; for example, those affected by high levels of unemployment and dereliction.<ref name=Baker/>\n\nSome ghost towns, especially those that preserve period-specific architecture, have become tourist attractions. Some examples are [[Bannack, Montana|Bannack]] in the United States, [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] in Canada, [[Craco]] in Italy, [[Kolmanskop]] in Namibia, [[Pripyat]] in Ukraine, and [[Danushkodi]] in India.\n\nThe town of [[Plymouth, Montserrat|Plymouth]] on the Caribbean island of [[Montserrat]] is a ghost town that is the ''[[de jure]]'' [[Capital city|capital]] of Montserrat. It was rendered uninhabitable by volcanic ash from an eruption of the [[Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe definition of a ghost town varies between individuals, and between cultures. Some writers discount settlements that were abandoned as a result of a natural or human-made disaster or other causes using the term only to describe settlements that were deserted because they were no longer economically viable; T. Lindsey Baker, author of ''Ghost Towns of Texas'', defines a ghost town as \"a town for which the reason for being no longer exists\".<ref name=Baker>{{cite book |last=Baker |first= T.

American author Lambert Florin's defined a ghost town as \"a shadowy semblance of a former self\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hall|first=Shawn|title=Ghost Towns and Mining Camps of Southern Nevada|year=2010|publisher=Arcadia Pub.|location=Charleston, SC|isbn=0738570125|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHLCS4HNjuQC&pg=PA7}}</ref>\n\n==Reasons for abandonment==\nFactors leading to the abandonment of towns include depleted natural resources, economic activity shifting elsewhere, railroads and roads bypassing or no longer accessing the town, human intervention, disasters, massacres, wars, and the shifting of politics or fall of empires.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Graves |first1=Philip |last2=Weiler |first2=Stephan |last3=Tynon |first3=Emily |ssrn=1540770 |title=The Economics of Ghost Towns|publisher=Social Science Research Network |date=25 January 2010}}</ref> A town can also be abandoned when it is part of an [[exclusion zone]] due to [[Plymouth, Montserrat|natural]] or [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|man-made causes]].\n\n===Economic activity shifting elsewhere===\n[[File:Abandoned farmhouse, overgrown.jpg|thumb|right|As farms [[Intensive farming|industrialize]], smaller farms are no longer economically viable, leading to rural decay.]]\n\nGhost towns may result when the single activity or resource that created a [[boomtown]] (e.g., nearby mine, mill or resort) is depleted or the resource economy undergoes a \"bust\" (e.g., catastrophic resource price collapse). Boomtowns can often decrease in size as fast as they initially grew. Sometimes, all or nearly the entire population can desert the town, resulting in a ghost town.\n\nThe dismantling of a boomtown can often occur on a planned basis. Mining companies nowadays will create a temporary community to service a mine site, building all the accommodation, shops and services required, and then remove them once the resource has been extracted. Modular buildings can be used to facilitate the process. A [[gold rush]] would often bring intensive but short-lived economic activity to a remote village, only to leave a ghost town once the resource was depleted.\n\nIn some cases, multiple factors may remove the economic basis for a community; some former [[mining town]]s on [[U.S. Route 66]] suffered both mine closures when the resources were depleted and loss of highway traffic as US 66 was diverted away from places like [[Oatman, Arizona]] onto a more direct path. Mine and pulp mill closures have led to many ghost towns in British Columbia, Canada including several relatively recent ones: [[Ocean Falls]] which closed in 1973 after the pulp mill was decommissioned, [[Kitsault]] B.C. whose molybdenum mine shut down after only 18 months in 1982, and [[Cassiar, British Columbia|Cassiar]] whose asbestos mine operated from 1952 to 1992.\n\nIn other cases, the reason for abandonment can arise from a town's intended economic function shifting to another, nearby place. This happened to [[Collingwood, Queensland]] in [[Outback]] [[Australia]] when nearby [[Winton, Queensland|Winton]] outperformed Collingwood as a regional centre for the livestock-raising industry. The railway reached Winton in 1899, linking it with the rest of [[Queensland]], and Collingwood was a ghost town by the following year.\n\nThe Middle East has many ghost towns that were created when the shifting of politics or the fall of empires caused capital cities to be socially or economically unviable, such as [[Ctesiphon]].\n\nThe rise of condominium investment and a resulting real estate bubble may also lead to a ghost town, as real estate prices rise and affordable housing becomes less available. Such examples include China and Canada, where housing is often used as an investment rather than for habitation.<!---What does that first clause mean?--->\n\n===Human intervention===\n[[File:Famagusta-Varosha 2007.JPG|thumb|Prior to the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, [[Varosha, Famagusta|Varosha]], now falling into ruin, once was a modern tourist area.]]\n[[File:Akarmaraghosttown.jpg|thumb|[[Akarmara]], a [[mining town]] in [[Abkhazia]]/[[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], was abandoned in the early 1990s due to the [[War in Abkhazia (1992\u201393)|War in Abkhazia]].]]\nRailroads and roads bypassing or no longer reaching a town can also create a ghost town. This was the case in many of the ghost towns along Ontario's historic [[Opeongo Line]], and along [[U.S. Route 66]] after motorists bypassed the latter on the faster moving highways [[Interstate 44|I-44]] and [[Interstate 40|I-40]]. Some ghost towns were founded along railways where [[steam train]]s would stop at periodic intervals to take on water. [[Amboy, California]] was part of one such series of villages along the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] across the [[Mojave Desert]].\n\nRiver re-routing is another factor, one example being the towns along the [[Aral Sea]].\n\nGhost towns may be created when land is [[eminent domain|expropriated]] by a government, and residents are required to relocate. One example is the village of [[Tyneham]] in [[Dorset]], England, acquired during World War II to build an artillery range.\n\nA similar situation occurred in the U.S. when [[NASA]] acquired land to construct the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] (SSC), a rocket testing facility in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]] (on the Mississippi side of the [[Pearl River (Mississippi\u2013Louisiana)|Pearl River]], which is the [[Mississippi]]\u2013[[Louisiana]] state line). This required NASA to acquire a large (approximately {{convert|34|sqmi|adj=on}}) [[buffer zone]] because of the loud noise and potential dangers associated with testing such rockets. Five thinly populated rural Mississippi communities (Gainesville, Logtown, Napoleon, Santa Rosa, and Westonia), plus the northern portion of a sixth ([[Pearlington, Mississippi|Pearlington]]), along with 700 families in residence, had to be completely relocated away from the facility.\n\nSometimes the town might cease to officially exist, but the physical infrastructure remains. For example, the five Mississippi communities that had to be abandoned to build SSC still have remnants of those communities within the facility itself. These include city streets, now overgrown with forest flora and fauna, and a one-room schoolhouse. Another example of infrastructure remaining is the former town of [[Weston, DuPage County, Illinois|Weston, Illinois]], that voted itself out of existence and turned the land over for construction of the [[Fermilab|Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]. Many houses and even a few barns remain, used for housing visiting scientists and storing maintenance equipment, while roads that used to cross through the site have been blocked off at the edges of the property, with gatehouses or barricades to prevent unsupervised access.\n\n====Flooding by dams====\nConstruction of dams has produced ghost towns that have been left underwater. Examples include the settlement of [[Loyston, Tennessee]], U.S., inundated by the creation of [[Norris Dam]]. The town was reorganised and reconstructed on nearby higher ground. Other examples are [[The Lost Villages]] of [[Ontario]] flooded by [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] construction in 1958, the hamlets of [[Nether Hambleton]] and [[Middle Hambleton]] in [[Rutland]], England, which were flooded to create [[Rutland Water]], and the villages of [[Ashopton]] and [[Derwent, Derbyshire|Derwent]], England, flooded during the construction of the [[Ladybower Reservoir]]. [[Mologa]] in Russia was flooded by the creation of [[Rybinsk reservoir]], and in France the [[Tignes Dam]] flooded the village of Tignes, displacing 78 families.{{Citation needed|reason=The wiki page for this dam does not mention and therefore does not cite the number of displaced families|date=June 2019}} Many ancient villages had to be abandoned during construction of the [[Three Gorges Dam]] in China, leading to the displacement of many rural people. In the Costa Rican province of Guanacaste, the town of [[Lake Arenal|Arenal]] was rebuilt to make room for the man-made [[Lake Arenal]]. The old town now lies submerged below the lake. [[Old Adaminaby]] was flooded by a dam of the [[Snowy River Scheme]]. Construction of the [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]] on the [[Nile River]] in Egypt submerged archaeological sites and ancient settlements such as [[Buhen]] under [[Lake Nasser]]. Another example of towns left underwater is [[Tehri]]; by the construction of the [[Tehri Dam]] in the Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]].\n\n====Massacres====\nSome towns become deserted when their populations are [[massacre]]d. The original French village at [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] was destroyed on [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre|10 June 1944]] when 642 of its 663 inhabitants were killed by a German [[Waffen-SS]] company. A new village was built after the war on a nearby site, and the ruins of the original have been maintained as a memorial.\n\n===Disasters, actual and anticipated===\n[[File:Craco0001.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Craco]], Italy, was abandoned due to a landslide in 1963. Now it is a popular film set.]]\nNatural and man-made disasters can create ghost towns. For example, after being flooded more than 30 times since their town was founded in 1845, residents of [[Pattonsburg, Missouri]], decided to relocate after two floods in 1993. With government help, the whole town was rebuilt {{convert|3|mi}} away.\n\n[[Craco]], a medieval village in the Italian region of [[Basilicata]], was evacuated after a landslide in 1963. Nowadays it is a famous filming location for many movies, including ''[[The Passion of The Christ]]'' by [[Mel Gibson]], ''[[Christ Stopped at Eboli (film)|Christ Stopped at Eboli]]'' by [[Francesco Rosi]], ''[[The Nativity Story]]'' by [[Catherine Hardwicke]] and ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' by [[Marc Forster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Craco,%20Matera,%20Basilicata,%20Italy&ref_=ttloc_loc_14|title=Most Popular Titles With Location Matching \"Craco, Matera, Basilicata, Italy\"|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984, [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] was abandoned due to an uncontainable [[mine fire]], which began in 1962 and still rages to this day; eventually the fire reached an abandoned mine underneath the nearby town of [[Byrnesville, Pennsylvania]], which caused that mine to catch on fire too and forced the evacuation of that town as well.\n\n[[File:Pripyat-today.jpg|thumb|[[Prypiat|Pripyat]], Ukraine, was abandoned after the [[Chernobyl disaster]].]]\nGhost towns may also occasionally come into being due to an ''anticipated'' natural disaster \u2013 for example, the Canadian town of [[Lemieux, Ontario]] was abandoned in 1991 after soil testing revealed that the community was built on an unstable bed of [[Leda clay]]. Two years after the last building in Lemieux was demolished, a landslide swept part of the former town-site into the [[South Nation River]]. Two decades earlier, the Canadian town of [[Saint-Jean-Vianney, Quebec|Saint-Jean-Vianney]], Qu\u00e9bec, also constructed on a Leda clay base, had been abandoned after a landslide on 4 May 1971, which swept away 41 homes, killing 31 people.\n\nFollowing the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, dangerously high levels of nuclear contamination escaped into the surrounding area, and nearly 200 towns and villages in [[Ukraine]] and neighbouring [[Belarus]] were evacuated, including the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]]. The area was so contaminated that many of the evacuees were never permitted to return to their homes. Pripyat is the most famous of these abandoned towns; it was built for the workers of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] and had a population of almost 50,000 at the time of the disaster.<ref name=chernobyl>{{cite book|last=Mould|first=R.

Some notable examples are [[Times Beach, Missouri]], whose residents were exposed to a high level of [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], and [[Wittenoom, Western Australia|Wittenoom]], [[Western Australia]], which was once Australia's largest source of [[blue asbestos]], but was shut down in 1966 due to health concerns.

Contamination due to [[ammunition]] caused by military use may also lead to the development of ghost towns. [[Tyneham]], in [[Dorset]], was requisitioned for military exercises during the [[Second World War]], and remains unpopulated, being littered with unexploded munitions from regular shelling.\n\n==Revived ghost towns==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 200\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Walhalla 1910 view4.jpg\n| width1    = \n| alt1      = Walhalla township in 1910\n| caption1  = Walhalla township in 1910\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = WalhallaVicCorner.jpg\n| width2    = \n| alt2      = Walhalla township in 2004\n| caption2  = Part of Walhalla in 2004, showing a mix of original and reconstructed buildings\n<!-- Extra parameters -->\n| header            = \n| header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| header_background = \n| footer            = [[Walhalla, Victoria]] was almost abandoned after being mined for gold, but is now becoming repopulated.\n| footer_align      = left\n| footer_background = \n| background color  = \n}}\n\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2012}}\n\nA few ghost towns get a second life, often due to [[heritage tourism]] generating a new economy able to support residents.

Since most of these camps were abandoned in the 1950s, the towns were abandoned as well. One such town is located near the former Gulag camp called [[Butugychag]] (also called Lower Butugychag). Other towns were deserted due to deindustrialisation and the economic crises of the early 1990s attributed to [[post-Soviet conflicts]] \u2013 one example being [[Tkvarcheli]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], a coal mining town that suffered a drastic population decline as a result of the [[War in Abkhazia (1992\u20131993)|War in Abkhazia]] in the early 1990s.\n\n'''INDIA'''\n\n'''[[Dhanushkodi|Dhanuskodi]]''' is an abondened town situated in the south-eastern tip of Pambam Island of the state of Tamil Nadu in India.

There are also many abandoned scientific and military bases in Antarctica, especially in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].\n\nThe Antarctic island of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]] used to have several thriving whaling settlements during the first half of the 20th century, with a combined population exceeding 2,000 in some years. These included [[Grytviken]] (operating 1904-64), [[Leith Harbour]] (1909\u201365), [[Ocean Harbour]] (1909\u201320), [[Husvik]] (1910\u201360), [[Stromness (South Georgia)|Stromness]] (1912\u201361) and [[Prince Olav Harbour]] (1917\u201334). The abandoned settlements have become increasingly dilapidated, and remain uninhabited nowadays except for the Museum curator's family at Grytviken. The jetty, the church, dwellings and industrial buildings at Grytviken have recently been renovated by the South Georgian Government, becoming a popular tourist destination. Some historical buildings in the other settlements are being restored as well.\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Oradour-sur-Glane-Streets-1294.jpg|thumb|Main street of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]], France, unchanged since the German massacre.]]\n[[Urbanization]] \u2013 the migration of a country's rural population into the cities \u2013 has left many European towns and villages deserted. An increasing number of settlements in Bulgaria are becoming ghost towns for this reason; at the time of the 2011 census, the country had 181 uninhabited settlements.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2011/07/21/1126999_bulgarias-population-is-73-million-official-2011-census-results |title=Bulgaria's population is 7.3 million - official 2011 census results |newspaper=The Sofia Echo |date=21 July 2011 |accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref> In Hungary, dozens of villages are also threatened with abandonment. The first village officially declared as \"dead\" was [[:hu:Gy\u0171r\u0171f\u0171|Gy\u0171r\u0171f\u0171]] in the late 1970s, but later it was repopulated as an eco-village. Some other depopulated villages were successfully saved as small rural resorts, such as [[K\u00e1n, Hungary|K\u00e1n]], [[Tornak\u00e1polna]], [[Szanticska]], [[Gorica, Hungary|Gorica]], and [[R\u00e9vfalu]].\n\nIn Spain, large zones of the mountainous [[Iberian System]] and the [[Pyrenees]] have undergone heavy depopulation since the early 20th century, leaving a string of ghost towns in areas such as the [[Solana Valley]]. Traditional agricultural practices such as sheep and goat rearing, on which the mountain village economy was based, were not taken over by the local youth, especially after the lifestyle changes that swept over rural Spain during the second half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |title=Sos Mundo Rural Aragon\u00e9s alerta de la despoblaci\u00f3n de los pueblos |publisher=Diario de Teruel |language=Spanish |date=12 March 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315150215/http://www.diariodeteruel.net/comarcas/30412-sos-mundo-rural-aragones-alerta-de-la-despoblacion-de-los-pueblos.html |archive-date=15 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, thousands of villages were abandoned during the Middle Ages, as a result of [[Black Death]], climate change, revolts, and [[enclosure]], the process by which vast amounts of farmland became privately owned. Since there are rarely any visible remains of these settlements, they are not generally considered ghost towns; instead, they are referred to in archaeological circles as [[deserted medieval village]]s.\n\nSometimes, wars and genocide end a town's life. In 1944, occupying German Waffen-SS troops murdered almost the entire population of the French village [[Oradour-sur-Glane]]. A new settlement was built nearby after the war, but the old town was left depopulated on the orders of President [[Charles de Gaulle]], as a permanent memorial. In Germany, numerous smaller towns and villages in the [[former eastern territories of Germany|former eastern territories]] were completely destroyed in the last two years of the war. These territories later became part of [[Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]], and many of the smaller settlements were never rebuilt or repopulated, for example [[K\u0142omino]] (''Westfalenhof''), [[Pstr\u0105\u017ce]] (''Pstransse''), and [[Janowa G\u00f3ra]] (''Johannesberg''). Some villages in England were also abandoned during the war, but for different reasons. [[Imber]], on [[Salisbury Plain]], and  several villages in the [[Stanford Battle Area]], were commandeered by the [[War Office]] for use as training grounds for British and US troops. Although this was intended to be a temporary measure, the residents were never allowed to return, and the villages have been used for military training ever since. Three miles southeast of Imber is [[Copehill Down]], a deserted village purpose-built for training in [[urban warfare]].\n\nDisasters have played a part in the abandonment of settlements within Europe. After the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986, the cities of [[Pripyat]] and [[Chernobyl]] were evacuated due to dangerous radiation levels within the area. As of today, Pripyat remains completely abandoned, and Chernobyl has around 500 remaining inhabitants.\n\n===North America===\n[[File:RobsartHospital.jpg|thumb|[[Robsart Hospital]], one of many abandoned buildings in [[Robsart, Saskatchewan]]]]\n\n====Canada====\n{{See also|Lists of ghost towns in Canada}}\nThere are ghost towns in parts of [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]], [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], and [[Quebec]]. Some were logging towns or dual mining and logging sites, often [[company town|developed at the behest of the company]]. In Alberta and Saskatchewan, most ghost towns were once farming communities that have since died off due to the removal of the railway through the town or the bypass of a highway. The ghost towns in British Columbia were predominantly mining towns and prospecting camps as well as canneries and, in one or two cases, large smelter and pulp mill towns. British Columbia has more ghost towns than any other jurisdiction on the North American continent, with one estimate at the number of abandoned and semi-abandoned towns and localities upwards of 1500.<ref>Ramsey, Bruce (1963-1975). ''Ghost Towns of British Columbia\". Vancouver: Mitchell Press.</ref> Among the most notable are [[Anyox]], [[Kitsault]], and [[Ocean Falls]].\n\nSome ghost towns have revived their economies and populations due to historical and eco-tourism, such as [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]]. Barkerville, once the largest town north of [[Kamloops]], is now a year-round provincial museum. In Quebec, [[Val-Jalbert, Quebec|Val-Jalbert]] is a well-known tourist ghost town; founded in 1901 around a mechanical [[pulp mill]] that became obsolete when [[paper mill]]s began to break down [[wood fibre]] by chemical means, it was abandoned when the mill closed in 1927 and re-opened as a park in 1960.\n{{clear left}}\n\n====United States====\n{{See also|List of ghost towns in the United States}}\n[[File:A363, Rhyolite, Nevada, USA, John S Cook and Company building, 2004.jpg|thumb|Cook Bank building in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]], a gold mining town]]\nMany ghost towns or abandoned [[unincorporated area|communities]] exist in the American [[Great Plains]], the rural areas of which have lost a third of their population since 1920. Thousands of communities in the northern plains states of [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]] became railroad ghost towns when a rail line failed to materialize. Hundreds of towns were abandoned when the [[Interstate highway system]] replaced the railroads as the favored mode of travel. Ghost towns are common in mining or [[mill town]]s in all the western states, and many eastern and southern states as well. Residents are compelled to leave in search of more productive areas when the resources that had created an employment boom in these towns were eventually consumed. Some unincorporated towns become ghost towns due to flooding caused by dam projects that created man{{endash}}made lakes, such as [[Oketeyeconne, Georgia|Oketeyeconne]].\n\nSometimes a ghost town consists of many abandoned buildings as in [[Bodie, California]], or standing ruins as in [[Rhyolite, Nevada]], while elsewhere only the foundations of former buildings remain as in [[Graysonia, Arkansas]]. Old mining camps that have lost most of their population at some stage of their history such as [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Deadwood, South Dakota|Deadwood]], [[Oatman, Arizona|Oatman]], [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]] and [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]] are sometimes referred to as ghost towns although they are presently active towns and cities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} Many U.S. ghost towns, such as [[South Pass City, Wyoming|South Pass City in Wyoming]]<ref>Weis, Norman D.

In 1590, mapmaker [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] arrived at the [[Roanoke Colony]], North Carolina to find it deserted, its inhabitants having vanished without a trace. The [[Zwaanendael Colony]] became a ghost town when every one of the colonists was massacred by Indians in 1632. [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], the first permanent English settlement in the Americas, was abandoned when [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] became the new capital of the colony in 1699. <!-- Consider removing this paragraph, off topic -->\n\nStarting in 2002, an attempt to declare an official ghost town in California stalled when the adherents of the town of [[Bodie, California|Bodie]] and those of [[Calico, San Bernardino County, California|Calico]], in [[Southern California]], could not agree on the most deserving settlement for the recognition. A compromise was eventually reached\u2013Bodie became the official state [[gold rush]] ghost town, while Calico was named the official state [[silver rush]] ghost town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/towns/ca_gold_rush_ghost_town.htm |title=California State Gold Rush Ghost Town |publisher=NetState |accessdate=28 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===South America===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a wave of European immigrants arrived in Brazil and settled in the cities, which offered jobs, education, and other opportunities that enabled newcomers to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system. Since the 1930s, many rural workers have moved to the big cities. Other ghost towns were created in the aftermath of dinosaur fossil rushes.\n\nA number of ghost towns throughout South America were once mining camps or lumber mills, such as the many [[sodium nitrate|saltpeter]] mining camps that prospered in Chile from the end of the [[War of the Pacific|Saltpeter War]] until the invention of synthetic saltpeter during World War I. Some of these towns, such as the [[Humberstone and Santa Laura Saltpeter Works]] in the [[Atacama Desert]], have been declared [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s. Another former mining town, [[Real de Catorce]] in Mexico, has been used as a backdrop for Hollywood movies such as ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), ''[[The Mexican]]'' (2001), and ''[[Bandidas]]'' (2006).\n\n===Oceania===\nThe boom and bust of gold rushes and the mining of other ores has led to a number of ghost towns in both Australia and New Zealand. Other towns have become abandoned whether due to natural disasters, the weather, or the drowning of valleys to increase the size of lakes.\n\nIn Australia, the [[Victoria gold rush]] led to numerous ghost towns (such as [[Cassilis, Victoria|Cassilis]] and [[Moliagul]]), as did the hunt for gold in [[Western Australia]] (for example, the towns of [[Ora Banda]] and [[Kanowna, Western Australia|Kanowna]]). The mining of iron and other ores has also led to towns thriving briefly before dwindling. \n\nIn New Zealand, the [[Otago gold rush]] similarly led to several ghost towns (such as [[Macetown]]). New Zealand's ghost towns also include numerous coal mining areas in the South Island's [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast Region]], including [[Denniston, New Zealand|Denniston]] and [[Stockton, New Zealand|Stockton]]. Natural disasters have also led to the loss of some towns, notably [[Te Wairoa (village)|Te Wairoa]], \"The Buried Village\", destroyed in the [[1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera]], and the Otago town of [[Kelso, New Zealand|Kelso]], abandoned after it was flooded repeatedly after heavy rainstorms. Early settlements on the rugged southwest coast of the South Island at [[Martins Bay]] and [[Port Craig]] were also abandoned, mainly due to the inhospitable terrain.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Abandoned mine#Abandoned mines|Abandoned mine]]\n*[[Abandoned village]]\n*[[Exclusion zone]]\n*[[List of ghost towns by country]]\n*[[Modern ruins]]\n*[[Old field (ecology)]]\n*[[Phantom settlement]]\n*[[Unused highway]]\n*[[Urban decay]]\n*[[Urban exploration]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- This section holds references that are cited by this article -->\n*{{cite book|last=Baker|first=T.

Having good communications with London, Chiswick became a popular country retreat and part of the suburban growth of London in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It became the [[Municipal Borough of Brentford and Chiswick]] in 1932 and part of [[Greater London]] in 1965, when it merged into the [[London Borough of Hounslow]]. Chiswick is an affluent area which includes [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]], Grove Park, the Glebe Estate, [[Strand-on-the-Green]] and [[London Underground|Tube]] stations [[Chiswick Park tube station|Chiswick Park]], [[Turnham Green]] and [[Gunnersbury]], as well as the [[Gunnersbury Triangle]] local nature reserve.\n\n[[Chiswick Roundabout]] is the start of the [[A406 road|North Circular Road]] (A406). At [[Hogarth Roundabout]], the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|Great West Road]] from central London becomes the [[M4 motorway (Great Britain)|M4]] motorway, providing a transport connection to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] and the [[M4 corridor]]. The [[A316 road|Great Chertsey Road]] (A316) runs south-west from the Hogarth Roundabout, becoming the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]].\n\nPeople who have lived in Chiswick include the poets [[Alexander Pope]] and [[W.

It contains [[Hogarth's House]], the former residence of the 18th-century English artist [[William Hogarth]]; [[Chiswick House]], a [[neo-Palladian]] villa regarded as one of the finest in England; and [[Fuller's Brewery]], London's largest and oldest brewery. In a [[meander]] of the [[River Thames]] used for competitive and recreational rowing, with several rowing clubs on the river bank, the finishing post for [[the Boat Race]] is just downstream of [[Chiswick Bridge]].\n\nChiswick was an [[St Nicholas Church, Chiswick|ancient parish]] in the county of [[Middlesex]], with an agrarian and fishing economy beside the river. Having good communications with London, Chiswick became a popular country retreat and part of the suburban growth of London in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It became the [[Municipal Borough of Brentford and Chiswick]] in 1932 and part of [[Greater London]] in 1965, when it merged into the [[London Borough of Hounslow]]. Chiswick is an affluent area which includes [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]], Grove Park, the Glebe Estate, [[Strand-on-the-Green]] and [[London Underground|Tube]] stations [[Chiswick Park tube station|Chiswick Park]], [[Turnham Green]] and [[Gunnersbury]], as well as the [[Gunnersbury Triangle]] local nature reserve.\n\n[[Chiswick Roundabout]] is the start of the [[A406 road|North Circular Road]] (A406). At [[Hogarth Roundabout]], the [[A4 road (Great Britain)|Great West Road]] from central London becomes the [[M4 motorway (Great Britain)|M4]] motorway, providing a transport connection to [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]] and the [[M4 corridor]]. The [[A316 road|Great Chertsey Road]] (A316) runs south-west from the Hogarth Roundabout, becoming the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]].\n\nPeople who have lived in Chiswick include the poets [[Alexander Pope]] and [[W.

In 1918, Yaroslavl Demidov State University became a successor university to the '''Demidov Lyceum''', which was founded in 1803.\n\n==History==\n\n===The Higher School of Sciences===\n[[Pavel Grigoryevich Demidov]] established the Demidov Law School by private means in 1803. On June 18, 1803, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander the First]], signed an [[Edict]] to the Senate about opening a higher educational institution in Yaroslavl. At first Demidov has been in contact with the Imperial authorities regarding the foundation of a university in Yaroslavl, even going so far as to promise his own private funding to the new institution; however, when this did not materialise the Imperial government decreed that the school was, upon opening, to have the same status as a university but to carry the title 'higher school of sciences' and thus to be considered junior only to the universities in [[Moscow State University|Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg]]. At first, the new institution enrolled only 11 students, but this situation quickly changed and soon the school was able to found a number of new faculties, including, amongst others, law, mathematics, chemistry, political economy and financial science . In 1819 modern French and German were also added to the syllabus.\n\n[[Image:Pavel Grigorievich Demidov.jpg|thumb|right|Pavel Grigorievich Demidov]]\nTwenty graduates from secondary schools could be educated at the school at the expense of its founder, and even these students had to be admitted from the nobility and other major estates of Yaroslavl Province. However, anyone who presented a certificate of general education or passed the school's entrance examination could be educated at their own expense. In the decrees of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], it was often emphasised that diplomas received from the School of Higher Sciences were equal to university degrees. In 1804, the first five students from the University of Moscow were sent to Yaroslavl to be educated. In 1805, a boarding school was opened so that scholars from other provinces could come to Yaroslavl and prepare themselves for the university's entrance exams, thus causing an exponential increase in the number of students.\n\nLater however, the school's fortunes waned and by the mid-19th century the institution seemed to be in decline. For example, the Minister of Public Education Dmitry Tolstoy, who visited Yaroslavl in 1866, found one professor, four acting professors, one lecturer and 39 students at the Lyceum, and thus in the same year the transformation project of the Lyceum with jurisprudence as its special subject was prepared on his initiative. This later gained assent from Alexander II.\n\n===Demidov Judicial Lyceum===\n[[Image:Demid.gif|thumb|left|The main building of the Demidov Judicial Lyceum. This building was eventually demolished in 1931.]]\nAfter its transformation into a Juridical [[Lyceum]] with higher educational, scientific and publishing status, Demidov's school in Yaroslavl enrolled over 900 students. The opening of the Demidov Juridical Lyceum took place on September 11, 1870, after around two years of preparation for the event. The judicial lyceum was from then on funded directly by the Imperial Russian Government, which mandated the institution of a four-year course which, upon successful completion, culminated in the student concerned being awarded the title 'candidate of judicial sciences'. Twenty scholarships which afforded government maintenance funds to their holders were also prepared and awarded each year.\n\nAfter the first students graduated, the judicial lyceum\u2019s interim statute was made permanent, with Alexander II finally approving the new Statute on January 6, 1875. After this the judicial lyceum became very popular and by the late 19th century had such a large number of students that in terms of ranking it was to be found second only to the universities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Even by 1903, only the [[University of Kiev]]'s faculty of law had successfully surpassed the student numbers of Yaroslavl's institution, so being ranked, along with Moscow and Petersburg's universities, above Demidov's school. In 1905 important changes were then also made to the organisation structure of the judicial lyceum, and resultantly, for the first time ever, the Lyceum\u2019s Council elected the school's director.\n\nThe possibility of transforming the Demidov judicial lyceum into a university began to be discussed in 1906. This initiative came from the Lyceum\u2019s Council and was supported by the larger community of Yaroslavl, the town's authorities and the Ministry of Public Education. Yaroslavl also found support in neighbouring provinces who promised their own material assistance so that a university could be founded close-by and so aid the economic and education development of their own territories. The Yaroslavl town council then states that it was prepared to make a gift of 16 hectares of land and a lump-sum grant of 1 million roubles to go towards the establishment of the university. After the February Revolution of 1917, the Russian Provisional Government at last approved the project of transforming the Lyceum into a university, however the revolutionary events that transpired later in that same year prevented the implementation of these decisions.\n\n===University of 1918===\n[[Image:Gymnasium of P. Antipova.jpg|right|thumb|Girls' school of Praskovya Antipova. The building which first housed the Yaroslavl State University.]]\nOn August 7, 1918, [[Vladimir Lenin]] signed a [[decree]] to change the Demidov Juridical Lyceum into a University. The university had 29 departments, including [[Agronomy|Agronomic]], [[pedagogy|Pedagogical]], [[Medical school|Medical]] and [[Law school|Law]] [[Faculty (division)|faculties]], and an evening school. In 1924, after the death of Vladimir Lenin, the university was closed.\n\nIn accordance with the decree of the Council of People's Commissars of January 21, 1919, signed by Lenin, the Demidov Judicial Lyceum was transformed into Yaroslavl State University. In 1922 its organisation included the Yaroslavl Institute of Education which existed to train teachers, and the Yaroslavl branch of the Moscow Archaeological Institute, which prepared the critics, historians and archaeologists. The university then also had faculties for the social sciences, medicine, agronomy, teaching, and technical education. The university's rectors, during its existence, were Valerian Nikolaevich Shiryaev (1918\u20131922) and Vasily Potemkin (1922\u20131924).\n\nIn 1924, the State University of Yaroslavl was closed due to reorganisation of the new-born USSR's education system, all of which was caused by financial difficulties in the country. The institution's Faculty of Education once again became an independent institution, and for over ten years remained the only institute of higher education in the province - Yaroslavl State Pedagogical Institute. The main building of the Lyceum was set alight and burned on the night of 7 July 1918 (lasting until the next day) during the Yaroslavl Uprising and was finally demolished in 1929 .

In 1918, Yaroslavl Demidov State University became a successor university to the '''Demidov Lyceum''', which was founded in 1803.\n\n==History==\n\n===The Higher School of Sciences===\n[[Image:Yaroslavl State University, 1 corpus.JPG|thumb|left|The main building of the Demidov State University, Red Square.]]\n[[Pavel Grigoryevich Demidov]] established the Demidov Law School by private means in 1803. On June 18, 1803, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander the First]], signed an [[Edict]] to the Senate about opening a higher educational institution in Yaroslavl. At first Demidov has been in contact with the Imperial authorities regarding the foundation of a university in Yaroslavl, even going so far as to promise his own private funding to the new institution; however, when this did not materialise the Imperial government decreed that the school was, upon opening, to have the same status as a university but to carry the title 'higher school of sciences' and thus to be considered junior only to the universities in [[Moscow State University|Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg]]. At first, the new institution enrolled only 11 students, but this situation quickly changed and soon the school was able to found a number of new faculties, including, amongst others, law, mathematics, chemistry, political economy and financial science . In 1819 modern French and German were also added to the syllabus.\n\n[[Image:Pavel Grigorievich Demidov.jpg|thumb|right|Pavel Grigorievich Demidov]]\nTwenty graduates from secondary schools could be educated at the school at the expense of its founder, and even these students had to be admitted from the nobility and other major estates of Yaroslavl Province. However, anyone who presented a certificate of general education or passed the school's entrance examination could be educated at their own expense. In the decrees of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], it was often emphasised that diplomas received from the School of Higher Sciences were equal to university degrees. In 1804, the first five students from the University of Moscow were sent to Yaroslavl to be educated. In 1805, a boarding school was opened so that scholars from other provinces could come to Yaroslavl and prepare themselves for the university's entrance exams, thus causing an exponential increase in the number of students.\n\nLater however, the school's fortunes waned and by the mid-19th century the institution seemed to be in decline. For example, the Minister of Public Education Dmitry Tolstoy, who visited Yaroslavl in 1866, found one professor, four acting professors, one lecturer and 39 students at the Lyceum, and thus in the same year the transformation project of the Lyceum with jurisprudence as its special subject was prepared on his initiative. This later gained assent from Alexander II.\n\n===Demidov Judicial Lyceum===\n[[Image:Demid.gif|thumb|left|The main building of the Demidov Judicial Lyceum. This building was eventually demolished in 1931.]]\nAfter its transformation into a Juridical [[Lyceum]] with higher educational, scientific and publishing status, Demidov's school in Yaroslavl enrolled over 900 students. The opening of the Demidov Juridical Lyceum took place on September 11, 1870, after around two years of preparation for the event. The judicial lyceum was from then on funded directly by the Imperial Russian Government, which mandated the institution of a four-year course which, upon successful completion, culminated in the student concerned being awarded the title 'candidate of judicial sciences'. Twenty scholarships which afforded government maintenance funds to their holders were also prepared and awarded each year.\n\nAfter the first students graduated, the judicial lyceum\u2019s interim statute was made permanent, with Alexander II finally approving the new Statute on January 6, 1875. After this the judicial lyceum became very popular and by the late 19th century had such a large number of students that in terms of ranking it was to be found second only to the universities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Even by 1903, only the [[University of Kiev]]'s faculty of law had successfully surpassed the student numbers of Yaroslavl's institution, so being ranked, along with Moscow and Petersburg's universities, above Demidov's school. In 1905 important changes were then also made to the organisation structure of the judicial lyceum, and resultantly, for the first time ever, the Lyceum\u2019s Council elected the school's director.\n\nThe possibility of transforming the Demidov judicial lyceum into a university began to be discussed in 1906. This initiative came from the Lyceum\u2019s Council and was supported by the larger community of Yaroslavl, the town's authorities and the Ministry of Public Education. Yaroslavl also found support in neighbouring provinces who promised their own material assistance so that a university could be founded close-by and so aid the economic and education development of their own territories. The Yaroslavl town council then states that it was prepared to make a gift of 16 hectares of land and a lump-sum grant of 1 million roubles to go towards the establishment of the university. After the February Revolution of 1917, the Russian Provisional Government at last approved the project of transforming the Lyceum into a university, however the revolutionary events that transpired later in that same year prevented the implementation of these decisions.\n\n===University of 1918===\n[[Image:Gymnasium of P. Antipova.jpg|right|thumb|Girls' school of Praskovya Antipova. The building which first housed the Yaroslavl State University.]]\nOn August 7, 1918, [[Vladimir Lenin]] signed a [[decree]] to change the Demidov Juridical Lyceum into a University. The university had 29 departments, including [[Agronomy|Agronomic]], [[pedagogy|Pedagogical]], [[Medical school|Medical]] and [[Law school|Law]] [[Faculty (division)|faculties]], and an evening school. In 1924, after the death of Vladimir Lenin, the university was closed.\n\nIn accordance with the decree of the Council of People's Commissars of January 21, 1919, signed by Lenin, the Demidov Judicial Lyceum was transformed into Yaroslavl State University. In 1922 its organisation included the Yaroslavl Institute of Education which existed to train teachers, and the Yaroslavl branch of the Moscow Archaeological Institute, which prepared the critics, historians and archaeologists. The university then also had faculties for the social sciences, medicine, agronomy, teaching, and technical education. The university's rectors, during its existence, were Valerian Nikolaevich Shiryaev (1918\u20131922) and Vasily Potemkin (1922\u20131924).\n\nIn 1924, the State University of Yaroslavl was closed due to reorganisation of the new-born USSR's education system, all of which was caused by financial difficulties in the country. The institution's Faculty of Education once again became an independent institution, and for over ten years remained the only institute of higher education in the province - Yaroslavl State Pedagogical Institute. The main building of the Lyceum was set alight and burned on the night of 7 July 1918 (lasting until the next day) during the Yaroslavl Uprising and was finally demolished in 1929 . In 1931, the Demidov pillar was also dismantled.\n\n===Re-establishment===\nOn September 1, 1970, the university was reopened and enrolled 300 students. Since then the university has gone from strength to strength and is now often considered to be one of Russia's premier universities. In the 1990s and 2000s, the university underwent an extensive program of development and has been constantly expanding the number of subject areas it operates in, thus allowing for overall expansion of its academic activities and student population. Every year a number of students from renowned Western universities including, amongst others, the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University College London]], attend Russian language courses at the university. The university also takes place in a number of exchange programs with universities and other higher educational institutions from around the world.\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Faculties===\nYaroslavl Demidov State University has ten faculties.\n\n{| width=\"90%\"\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"33%\"|\n*[[Biology]] and [[Ecology]]\n*[[Computer science]]\n*[[History]]\n|  valign=\"top\" width=\"33%\"|\n*[[Mathematics]]\n*[[Social studies|Socio-Political Sciences]]\n*[[Psychology]]\n|  valign=\"top\" width=\"33%\"|\n*[[Physics]]\n*[[Economics]]\n*[[Law]]\n|}\n\n*The Center of [[Russian Language]] and Russia Area Studies\n\n===Departments===\n\nYaroslavl Demidov State University has four departments.\n\n*International Relations Office\n*Department of foreign languages\n*Centre of New Information Technologies\n*Internet Centre\n \u2022\" Hostel\"\n\n==Campus==\n{| align=\"center\" class=\"standard\"\n|+\n! |Building \u2116\n! |Address\n! |Department/Faculty\n! |Coordinates\n! |Photograph\n|-----\n| I\n| 14 Sovetskaya Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u0434. 14)\n| Administration and rector's office, Faculty of Physics\n| {{coord|57|37|58|N|39|53|14|E}}\n| [[File:Yaroslavl State University, 1 corpus.JPG|150px]]\n|-----\n| II\n| 8/10 Kirova Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0434. 8/10)\n| Faculty of Physics, Applications office\n| {{coord|57|37|35|N|39|53|23|E}}\n| [[File:Yaroslavl State University, 2 corpus.jpg|150px]]\n|-----\n| III\n| 10 Sovetskaya Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u0434. 10)\n| Faculty of History, Faculty of Social and Political Sciences\n| {{coord|57|37|52|N|39|53|25|E}}\n\n Hostel no 5\n street, Gagarina 16\n| [[File:Yaroslavl State University, 3 corpus.jpg|150px]]\n|-----\n| IV\n| 9 Proezd Matrosova<br>(\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434 \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0434. 9)\n| Faculty of Psychology, Faculty of Biology and Ecology\n| {{coord|57|34|27|N|39|51|26|E}}\n| \n|-----\n| V\n| 17d Prospekt Oktyabrya<br>(\u043f\u0440-\u043a\u0442 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f, \u0434. 17\u0434)\n| Faculty of Physics, laboratories \n| {{coord|57|37|58.5|N|39|52|37|E}}\n|-----\n| VI\n| 3 Komsomolskaya Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u0434. 3)\n| Faculty of Economics\n| {{coord|57|37|30.7|N|39|53|4|E}}\n| [[File:\u042f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044c, \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f,3.jpg|150px]]\n|-----\n| VII\n| 144 Soyuznaya Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0434. 144)\n| Faculty of Mathematics, Faculty of Computer Science\n| {{coord|57|37|18|N|39|55|33|E}}\n| [[File:Yaroslval-University-001.jpg|150px]]\n|-----\n| VIII\n| 36a Sobinova Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u0421\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0434. 36\u0430)\n| Faculty of Law\n| {{coord|57|37|34.9|N|39|52|51.5|E}}\n| [[File:Yaroslavl State University, 8 corpus.jpg|150px]]\n|-----\n| IX\n| 14b Slepneva Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u0421\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0430, 14\u0431)\n| University college\n|\n|\n|-----\n| X\n| 1 Polushkina Rosha Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0449\u0430, \u0434. 1)\n| library, sports centre\n| {{coord|57|38|43.5|N|39|52|37|E}}\n| [[File:Yaroslavl State University, 10 corpus.jpg|150px]]\n|+\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Education in Russia]]\n*[[List of universities in Russia]]\n\n==References==\n*[[George Vernadsky]].
