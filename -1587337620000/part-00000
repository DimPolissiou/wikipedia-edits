Deputy Eubanks said, \"We're really, really bored and we need somebody to play with, so you're it, OK?\" Later the staff nurse warned him that \"they like to hurt people around here\" in hopes he would stop picking fights verbally with the arresting officers. An unidentified officer made a shadow-boxing motion. When Hay was eventually searched, an officer twisted his thin frail arm for so long and with such force that he eventually broke it. After spending the night with a broken arm and no medical attention, he was released and sought medical care three days later. In 2002, Hay settled a lawsuit against the department for $147,500.

Deputy Eubanks said, \"We're really, really bored and we need somebody to play with, so you're it, OK?\" Later the staff nurse warned him that \"they like to hurt people around here\" in hopes he would stop picking fights verbally with the arresting officers. An unidentified officer made a shadow-boxing motion. When Hay was eventually searched, an officer twisted his thin frail arm for so long and with such force that he eventually broke it. After spending the night with a broken arm and no medical attention, he was released and sought medical care three days later. In 2002, Hay settled a lawsuit against the department for $147,500.

However, the Stock Market Crash of October 1929, followed by the Great Depression, forced cancellation of the Cuneo Building proposal along with many other architectural projects. Thus, the Carbide & Carbon Building was the practice's last major commission before the Great Depression ended, by which time the firm had become Burnham & Hammond.\n\n==The architects==\nBurnham Brothers was the firm of Daniel H. Jr. and Hubert Burnham, sons of prominent Chicago architect [[Daniel Burnham]], and one of the two successor firms to his [[D.H. Burnham & Company]].  After Burnham senior died in 1912, D.H. Burnham & Co. became Graham, Burnham & Co., named after Burnham's main partner, [[Ernest R. Graham (architect)|Ernest Graham]], and Burnham's two sons.  When the two brothers left in 1917 to start their own firm, the remaining members of Graham, Burnham & Co. formed [[Graham, Anderson, Probst & White]] \u2013 the main successor firm, which carried on Daniel Burnham's remaining work and went on to become one of the major architectural firms in Chicago during the 1920s through the 1940s.  The brothers at first confused matters by reviving the name D.H. Burnham Co. (nearly but not exactly like the original D.H. Burnham & Co.), which they maintained for 11 years until 1928, when the firm officially became Burnham Brothers.  In 1933, the firm joined with C. Herrick Hammond to form Burnham & Hammond.\n\nFor all its success over nine decades, GAP&W \u2013 which had its offices in Burnham's [[Santa Fe Building (Chicago)|Railway Exchange Building]], where D.H. Burnham & Co. had maintained its offices \u2013 had no successor firm (it closed in 2006).  The largest architectural firm in Chicago today and one of the major architectural firms worldwide \u2013 the world-renowned [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]], aka SOM, which also has its headquarters in the Railway Exchange Building \u2013 is actually an offshoot of Burnham Brothers:  Nathaniel A. Owings joined the practice in 1929 and left in 1934, and Louis Skidmore joined in 1930 and left in 1936.  Skidmore and Owings started their own firm in 1936, and John Ogden Merrill joined them in 1939 to create SOM.<ref>Graphic: Chicago Architects: A Genealogy, A Work in Progress building upon the \"Chicago Architects: A Genealogy\" graphic published in the Art Institute of Chicago's exhibition catalog titled ''Chicago Architecture and Design, 1923-1993: Reconfiguration of an American Metropolis in 1993'' by Stanley Tigerman, et al.; Society of Architectural Historians</ref>\n\nThe Carbide & Carbon Building is probably the best known of all the brothers' Chicago commissions.  Their other building designs include the original State of Illinois Building at 160 N. LaSalle St. (1924), the Seneca Hotel at 200 E. Chestnut St. (1926), the Bankers Building, aka the Clark-Adams Building (1927), the City-State Building (1927), the Randolph-Wells Building (1928), and the Engineering Building at 205 W.

However, the Stock Market Crash of October 1929, followed by the Great Depression, forced cancellation of the Cuneo Building proposal along with many other architectural projects. Thus, the Carbide & Carbon Building was the practice's last major commission before the Great Depression ended, by which time the firm had become Burnham & Hammond.\n\n==The architects==\nBurnham Brothers was the firm of Daniel H. Jr. and Hubert Burnham, sons of prominent Chicago architect [[Daniel Burnham]], and one of the two successor firms to his [[D.H. Burnham & Company]].  After Burnham senior died in 1912, D.H. Burnham & Co. became Graham, Burnham & Co., named after Burnham's main partner, [[Ernest R. Graham (architect)|Ernest Graham]], and Burnham's two sons.  When the two brothers left in 1917 to start their own firm, the remaining members of Graham, Burnham & Co. formed [[Graham, Anderson, Probst & White]] \u2013 the main successor firm, which carried on Daniel Burnham's remaining work and went on to become one of the major architectural firms in Chicago during the 1920s through the 1940s.  The brothers at first confused matters by reviving the name D.H. Burnham Co. (nearly but not exactly like the original D.H. Burnham & Co.), which they maintained for 11 years until 1928, when the firm officially became Burnham Brothers.  In 1933, the firm joined with C. Herrick Hammond to form Burnham & Hammond.\n\nFor all its success over nine decades, GAP&W \u2013 which had its offices in Burnham's [[Santa Fe Building (Chicago)|Railway Exchange Building]], where D.H. Burnham & Co. had maintained its offices \u2013 had no successor firm (it closed in 2006).  The largest architectural firm in Chicago today and one of the major architectural firms worldwide \u2013 the world-renowned [[Skidmore, Owings & Merrill]], aka SOM, which also has its headquarters in the Railway Exchange Building \u2013 is actually an offshoot of Burnham Brothers:  Nathaniel A. Owings joined the practice in 1929 and left in 1934, and Louis Skidmore joined in 1930 and left in 1936.  Skidmore and Owings started their own firm in 1936, and John Ogden Merrill joined them in 1939 to create SOM.<ref>Graphic: Chicago Architects: A Genealogy, A Work in Progress building upon the \"Chicago Architects: A Genealogy\" graphic published in the Art Institute of Chicago's exhibition catalog titled ''Chicago Architecture and Design, 1923-1993: Reconfiguration of an American Metropolis in 1993'' by Stanley Tigerman, et al.; Society of Architectural Historians</ref>\n\nThe Carbide & Carbon Building is probably the best known of all the brothers' Chicago commissions.  Their other building designs include the original State of Illinois Building at 160 N. LaSalle St. (1924), the Seneca Hotel at 200 E. Chestnut St. (1926), the Bankers Building, aka the Clark-Adams Building (1927), the City-State Building (1927), the Randolph-Wells Building (1928), and the Engineering Building at 205 W.

Working under the temporarily revived D.H.

Due to the makeup of the Jewish community in the US, most of the prayer books are geared to the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]] custom. In more recent years, Artscroll has collaborated with Sephardic community leaders in an attempt to bridge this gap. Examples of this include a Sephardic [[Haggadah]] published by Artscroll, written by Sephardic Rabbi Eli Mansour, and the book ''[[Aleppo]]'', about a prominent [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]] community in [[Syria]].<ref>{{cite book\n   |title=Through the flames of Aleppo: A novel (ArtScroll youth series)\n   |url=https://www.amazon.com/Through-flames-Aleppo-novel-ArtScroll/dp/1578195381\n   |isbn=1578195381}}</ref>\n\nIn translations and commentaries, ArtScroll accepts [[midrash]]ic accounts in a historical fashion, and at times literally; it disagrees with [[textual criticism]].

The set of Talmud was completed in late 2004, giving a 73 volume English edition of the entire Talmud. This was the second complete translation of the Talmud into English (the other being the [[Soncino Press|Soncino]] Talmud published in the United Kingdom during the mid-twentieth century).\n\nThe first volume, Tractate Makkos, was published in 1990,<ref name=\"ny\"/> and dedicated by Mr. and Mrs. Marcos Katz. [[Jerome Schottenstein]] was introduced by Dr. Norman Lamm to the publication committee shortly thereafter. He began by donating funds for the project in memory of his parents Ephraim and Anna Schottenstein one volume at a time, and later decided to back the entire project. When Jerome died, his children and widow, Geraldine, rededicated the project to his memory in addition to those of his parents. The goal of the project was to, \"open the doors of the Talmud and welcome its people inside.\"\n\nThe text generally consists of two side-by-side pages: one of the [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic|Aramaic]]/[[Mishnaic Hebrew|Hebrew]] [[Vilna Edition]] text, and the corresponding page consists of an English translation. The English translation has a bolded literal translation of the Talmud's text, but also includes un-bolded text clarifying the literal translation. (The original Talmud's text is often very unclear, referring to places, times, people, and laws that it does not explain. The un-bolded text attempts to explain these situations. The text of the Talmud also contains few prepositions, articles, etc. The un-bolded text takes the liberty of inserting these parts of speech.) The result is an English text that reads in full sentences with full explanations, while allowing the reader to distinguish between direct translation and a more liberal approach to the translation. (This also results in one page of the Vilna Talmud requiring several pages of English translation.) Below the English translation appear extensive notes including diagrams.<ref name=\"ny\"/>\n\nArtScroll's English explanations and footnoted commentary in the Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud are based on the perspective of classical Jewish sources. The clarifying explanation is generally based on the viewpoint of [[Rashi]], the medieval commentator who wrote the first comprehensive commentary on the Talmud.

Stone|Stone Editions]] of Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) and [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Pentateuch) use many more transliterated Hebrew words than English words, compared to editions such as the [[Tanakh]] of the [[Jewish Publication Society]]. This reflects a higher use of untranslated Hebrew terminology in Haredi English usage.\n\nArtScroll's transliteration system for [[Hebrew transliteration]] for readers of the English language generally uses [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] consonants and [[Sephardi Hebrew|Sefardi]] vowels. The two major differences between the way Sefardi and Ashkenazi Hebrew dialects are transcribed are as follows:\n*the letter [[Taw (letter)|Tav]] without a [[dagesh]] (emphasis point) is transcribed as [t] and [s] respectively\n**ArtScroll uses the latter\n*the vowel [[niqqud|kamatz gadol]], is transcribed [a] and [o] respectively\n**ArtScroll uses the former\n\nAs such, the following transliterations are used:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Ashkenazi\n!Sefardi\n!ArtScroll\n|-\n|Boruch\n|Barukh\n|Baruch\n|-\n|Shabbos\n|Shabbat\n|Shabbos (<small>ArtScroll makes an exception due to widespread usage</small>)\n|-\n|Succos\n|Succot\n|Succos\n|-\n|Avrohom\n|Avraham\n|Avraham\n|-\n|Akeidas Yitzchok\n|Akedat Yitzhak\n|Akeidas Yitzchak\n|}\n\n==Criticism==\n* A large number of grammatical errors exist in their Bible and commentary translations, changing the meaning of these passages. B. Barry Levy alleged in 1981:<blockquote>''Dikduk'' (grammar) is anathema in many Jewish circles, but the translation and presentation of texts is, to a large extent, a [[Philology|philological]] activity and must be philologically accurate. The ArtScroll effort has not achieved a respectable level. There are dozens of cases where prepositions are misunderstood, where verb tenses are not perceived properly and where grammatical or linguistic terms are used incorrectly. Words are often vocalized incorrectly. These observations, it should be stressed, are not limited to the Bible text but refer to the talmudic, midrashic, targumic, medieval and modern works as well. Rabbinical passages are removed from their contexts, presented in fragmentary form thus distorting their contents, emended to update their messages even though these new ideas were not expressed in the texts themselves, misvocalized, and mistranslated: i.e. misrepresented.<ref>{{cite journal|first=B. Barry |last=Levy |title=Judge Not a Book By Its Cover |journal=Tradition |volume=19 |issue=1 |date=Spring 1981|pages=89&ndash;95}}</ref></blockquote>\n* ArtScroll biographies have been criticized as providing incomplete and partial portrayals of Rabbinic figures. Notably, this is not disputed by ArtScroll. Rabbi Nosson Scherman stated that as it pertains to biographies the mission of ArtScroll \"is to impart a positive message\" without mentioning \"disputes that can often become vitriolic.\"<ref>Scherman in an interview with Rabbi Yitzchok Frankfurter published in ''A Conversation with Rabbi Nosson Scherman On Chinuch'' (p. 66-73 in Ami Magazine, June 21, 2017), in which Frankfurter stated \"[t]o be honest, I sometimes question ArtScroll's approach when it comes to certain things. One of these is the tendency to portray the commonality between ''gedolei Yisrael'' rather than their particular ''hashkafos'' [worldviews]. I grew up in a generation when people liked to debate what this ''gadol'' said versus what another one said. Today there's much more uniformity; everyone believes the same things in the same way.\" Upon responding \"[o]ur role is not to discuss issues in current events. Our intention is to present the text,\" Frankfurter questioned Scherman: \"Even when it comes to biographies and the like?\" Scherman replied: \"We include the opinions of whichever ''gadol'' is the subject of the biography, but we don't necessarily discuss dissenting views. We feel that our mission is to educate people and to be ''marbeh kevod shamayim'' [to increase honor of God]. We try to stay away from disputes that can often become vitriolic. Getting involved in such things is not our mission. Our mission is to impart a positive message.\"</ref>\n* The commentary of [[Rashbam]] to the first chapter of Genesis<ref>ArtScroll omitted entire sections of Rashbam's commentary on Gen. 1:4, 1:5, 1:8, and 1:31.

However, Rashbam takes a [[peshat]] (plain sense) approach, as he does throughout his commentary, reading the verse as follows: \"There was an evening (at the conclusion of daytime) and a morning (at the end of night), one day\"; that is, the day begins in the morning and lasts until the next daybreak.<ref>First identified by [[Marc B.

In more recent years, Artscroll has collaborated with Sephardic community leaders in an attempt to bridge this gap.

When Jerome died, his children and widow, Geraldine, rededicated the project to his memory in addition to those of his parents. The goal of the project was to, \"open the doors of the Talmud and welcome its people inside.\"\n\nThe text generally consists of two side-by-side pages: one of the [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic|Aramaic]]/[[Mishnaic Hebrew|Hebrew]] [[Vilna Edition]] text, and the corresponding page consists of an English translation. The English translation has a bolded literal translation of the Talmud's text, but also includes un-bolded text clarifying the literal translation. (The original Talmud's text is often very unclear, referring to places, times, people, and laws that it does not explain. The un-bolded text attempts to explain these situations. The text of the Talmud also contains few prepositions, articles, etc. The un-bolded text takes the liberty of inserting these parts of speech.) The result is an English text that reads in full sentences with full explanations, while allowing the reader to distinguish between direct translation and a more liberal approach to the translation. (This also results in one page of the Vilna Talmud requiring several pages of English translation.) Below the English translation appear extensive notes including diagrams.<ref name=\"ny\"/>\n\nArtScroll's English explanations and footnoted commentary in the Schottenstein Edition of the Talmud are based on the perspective of classical Jewish sources. The clarifying explanation is generally based on the viewpoint of [[Rashi]], the medieval commentator who wrote the first comprehensive commentary on the Talmud. The Schottenstein Edition does not include contemporary academic or critical scholarship.  The overall guidelines follow a pattern defined by the late Rabbi Hersh Goldwurm, \"a Monsey, N.Y., scholar who died in 1993.\"<ref name=\"ny\"/>\n\nThe total cost of the project is estimated at US$21 million,<ref name=\"ny\"/> most of which was contributed by private donors and foundations. Some volumes have up to 2 million copies in distribution, while more recent volumes have only 90,000 copies currently printed. A completed set was dedicated on February 9, 2005, to the [[Library of Congress]], and the [[siyum]] (celebration at the \"completion\") was held on March 15, 2005, the 13th [[yahrzeit]] of Jerome Schottenstein, at the [[New York Hilton]].\n\nMesorah and the Schottenstein family have also printed a Hebrew version of the commentary and have begun both an English and Hebrew translation of the ''Talmud Yerushalmi'' ([[Jerusalem Talmud]]).\n\nThe blue-covered Hebrew Talmud set, which like the English counterpart is 73 volumes, has a [[Haskama|HasKaMa]] (approbation) from a [[Bobover]] Rebbe, Grand Rabbi [[Naftali Tzvi Halberstam|Naftali Halberstam]].<ref>printed inside</ref>\n\nA French language set was begun.<ref>copies have been sold in the USA. The first volume was in memory of Mr. [[Safra Group|Safra]] of the eponymous bank.</ref>\n\n==Transliteration system==\nArtscroll publications,<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Jewish prayers for Orthodox services - Translation and transliteration\n|url=http://www.kakatuv.com/orthodox.html\n|quote=... correspond to the Rabbinical Council of America Edition of the Artscroll Siddur}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=If You Can Read This - You Can Pray In Hebrew\n|url=http://ou.org.s3.amazonaws.com/publications/siddur.htm}}</ref> such as the [[Irving I. Stone|Stone Editions]] of Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) and [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Pentateuch) use many more transliterated Hebrew words than English words, compared to editions such as the [[Tanakh]] of the [[Jewish Publication Society]]. This reflects a higher use of untranslated Hebrew terminology in Haredi English usage.\n\nArtScroll's transliteration system for [[Hebrew transliteration]] for readers of the English language generally uses [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]] consonants and [[Sephardi Hebrew|Sefardi]] vowels. The two major differences between the way Sefardi and Ashkenazi Hebrew dialects are transcribed are as follows:\n*the letter [[Taw (letter)|Tav]] without a [[dagesh]] (emphasis point) is transcribed as [t] and [s] respectively\n**ArtScroll uses the latter\n*the vowel [[niqqud|kamatz gadol]], is transcribed [a] and [o] respectively\n**ArtScroll uses the former\n\nAs such, the following transliterations are used:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Ashkenazi\n!Sefardi\n!ArtScroll\n|-\n|Boruch\n|Barukh\n|Baruch\n|-\n|Shabbos\n|Shabbat\n|Shabbos (<small>ArtScroll makes an exception due to widespread usage</small>)\n|-\n|Succos\n|Succot\n|Succos\n|-\n|Avrohom\n|Avraham\n|Avraham\n|-\n|Akeidas Yitzchok\n|Akedat Yitzhak\n|Akeidas Yitzchak\n|}\n\n==Criticism==\n* A large number of grammatical errors exist in their Bible and commentary translations, changing the meaning of these passages. B. Barry Levy alleged in 1981:<blockquote>''Dikduk'' (grammar) is anathema in many Jewish circles, but the translation and presentation of texts is, to a large extent, a [[Philology|philological]] activity and must be philologically accurate. The ArtScroll effort has not achieved a respectable level. There are dozens of cases where prepositions are misunderstood, where verb tenses are not perceived properly and where grammatical or linguistic terms are used incorrectly. Words are often vocalized incorrectly. These observations, it should be stressed, are not limited to the Bible text but refer to the talmudic, midrashic, targumic, medieval and modern works as well. Rabbinical passages are removed from their contexts, presented in fragmentary form thus distorting their contents, emended to update their messages even though these new ideas were not expressed in the texts themselves, misvocalized, and mistranslated: i.e. misrepresented.<ref>{{cite journal|first=B. Barry |last=Levy |title=Judge Not a Book By Its Cover |journal=Tradition |volume=19 |issue=1 |date=Spring 1981|pages=89&ndash;95}}</ref></blockquote>\n* ArtScroll biographies have been criticized as providing incomplete and partial portrayals of Rabbinic figures. Notably, this is not disputed by ArtScroll. Rabbi Nosson Scherman stated that as it pertains to biographies the mission of ArtScroll \"is to impart a positive message\" without mentioning \"disputes that can often become vitriolic.\"<ref>Scherman in an interview with Rabbi Yitzchok Frankfurter published in ''A Conversation with Rabbi Nosson Scherman On Chinuch'' (p. 66-73 in Ami Magazine, June 21, 2017), in which Frankfurter stated \"[t]o be honest, I sometimes question ArtScroll's approach when it comes to certain things. One of these is the tendency to portray the commonality between ''gedolei Yisrael'' rather than their particular ''hashkafos'' [worldviews]. I grew up in a generation when people liked to debate what this ''gadol'' said versus what another one said. Today there's much more uniformity; everyone believes the same things in the same way.\" Upon responding \"[o]ur role is not to discuss issues in current events. Our intention is to present the text,\" Frankfurter questioned Scherman: \"Even when it comes to biographies and the like?\" Scherman replied: \"We include the opinions of whichever ''gadol'' is the subject of the biography, but we don't necessarily discuss dissenting views. We feel that our mission is to educate people and to be ''marbeh kevod shamayim'' [to increase honor of God]. We try to stay away from disputes that can often become vitriolic. Getting involved in such things is not our mission. Our mission is to impart a positive message.\"</ref>\n* The commentary of [[Rashbam]] to the first chapter of Genesis<ref>ArtScroll omitted entire sections of Rashbam's commentary on Gen. 1:4, 1:5, 1:8, and 1:31. See [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40236&st=&pgnum=43 David Rosin, ''Perush Rashbam al Ha-Torah'' (Breslau, 1882), pp. 5-6, 9] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219052818/http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40236&st=&pgnum=43 |date=February 19, 2015 }}</ref> in ArtScroll's ''Czuker Edition Hebrew Chumash Mikra'os Gedolos Sefer Bereishis'' (2014) has been censored. The missing passages are related to [[Rashbam]]'s interpretation of the phrase in Genesis 1:5, \"and there was an evening, and there was a morning, one day.\" The Talmud<ref>Hulin 83a</ref> cites these words to support the [[halakhic]] view that the day begins at sundown. However, Rashbam takes a [[peshat]] (plain sense) approach, as he does throughout his commentary, reading the verse as follows: \"There was an evening (at the conclusion of daytime) and a morning (at the end of night), one day\"; that is, the day begins in the morning and lasts until the next daybreak.<ref>First identified by [[Marc B.

Through their [[nomad]]ic movement, the Hawazma know the area, [[terrain]], [[ethnic group]]s, local tribes, tribal [[culture]]s, [[ecosystem]]s, [[climate]], [[vegetation]], existence of risks and [[disease]]s, and water resources better than any other inhabitants of the region. The term Baggara is a collective name applied to all cattle-herding tribes with [[Arab]] roots.  Cattle herders from [[Nuba]] tribes are not called Baggara.  Cattle herders of middle and eastern [[Sudan]], although they Arabic in roots, are also not Baggara.  The Baggara occupies a wide area, from [[Kurdufan|Kordofan]], Mid-Western Sudan, to [[Darfur]] in the far Western Sudan and extending to neighboring [[Chad]].  They are a collection of seven major tribes:  [[Hawazma]], [[Humur|Messiria Humr]] [[Messiria]] Zurug, [[Rizeigat]], [[Ta\u2019isha]], [[Habbaniya people|Habbaniya]], [[Beni Halba]], [[Awlad Himayd]], and [[Beni Selam]].  All Baggara have close physical characteristics, [[costume]]s, [[dance]], [[religion]], [[food]], and in general a common [[culture]] and way of life.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Hawazma are believed to have migrated to Sudan during early days of [[Islam]]ic [[missionaries]] to Africa as part of [[Baggara]] [[Arabs]], perhaps as early as the 12th century.  Most [[historian]]s believe they belong to the  [[Guhayna]] group; a [[clan]] of [[Bedouin]] [[Arab]]s which migrated from [[Saudi Arabia]].  Hawazma traditional historians say they originally came from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to [[Egypt]] then followed the [[Nile River|River Nile]] until they settled on [[Jebel Awliyya]] part of [[Khartoum]] Province and as the grazing land became scarce and overcrowded they gradually moved to Western Sudan.  These stories correspond well with the presence of scores of Hawazma in [[Kosti, Sudan|Kosti]], Middle Sudan, [[Um Rowaba]], Eastern part of Kordofan and [[Al Rahad]], middle-eastern part of Kordofan.  The journey continued beyond Kordofan, to Darfur on the Western Sudan and today they have reached [[Chad]], the country on western border of Sudan.\n\nWherever Baggara settle they start a seasonal nomadic movement that goes from north to south, in a Round-Robin fashion according to the season and perpendicular to their historical migration route.  Mostly they only follow two routes, one route from north to south and different route from south to north. But the routes are not far apart, and they are permanent, they never change them.  Any tribe has its own routes.  Hawazma are mostly found in routes originating from [[Al-Ubayyid|Al Obeid]] city in [[North Kurdufan]], through Deling city and its eastern part, [[Kadugli]] city and its eastern part, to [[Talodi]] region.  [[Messiria]] just borders them to the west.  Humr borders Messiria to the west. And so forth.\n\nToday the Hawazma in particular and Baggara in general bear little resemblance to Bedouin Arabs, due to their acclimatization and their inter-marriage with other African tribes.  Many Hawazma subtribes have dark skin, and closely resemble Nuba tribes.  And many members of these tribes speak Nuba dialects fluently.  Still some tribe names indicate their mixed origins. Other Hawazma subtribes have preserved their Arabic features: light brown complexion, and thick eyebrows and lashes.\n\n==Socio-economic factors: pastoralism and agriculture==\n[[Image:Baggara Arabs.jpg|thumb|right|300px|This picture typical of Hawazma [[Baggara]] when reach [[North Kurdufan]] in their north journey out of the muddy land of [[South Kordofan]]]]\nWhen Hawazma families lose their herds they settle.  Generally, Hawazma settled in [[village]]s or established villages from southern parts of Al Obeid city in Northern Kordofan to Talodi city in South Kordofan.  Those who settled in northern border of [[South Kordofan]] or Southern border of North Kordofan are mostly Gumaiyya, including:  Gumaiyya Kilaibab, Gumaiyya Al Hussienat, and Gumaiyya Matrafia, in addition to other Hawazma Oulad Gaboush and Dar Niayylie.  These subtribes intermarried with Bidaria and Mosabaat and other Kordofanian tribes.  Their lifestyle closely resembles the Kordofanian tribes.  Mostly engaged in raising crops and cattle.  Notably their Hawazma Arabic Accent is inclined to include Kordofanian Arabic accents.  Similarly, they adopted a way of cultivation, crop tending, and harvesting similar to those other Kordofanian tribes.  They used a long-handled spade called Jarrieh and Saloqqa, they tend their farm while standing, not similar to those of Hawazma deep in South Kordofan who tend while they are sitting on their heels.  Their crops include:  millet, watermelon, groundnuts, sesame and hibiscus.\n\n[[Image:Baggara Boys.jpg|thumb|right|300px|This picture typical of Hawazma [[Baggara]] cow boys, in [[North Kurdufan]] ]]\n\nThose who settled in the middle of South Kordofan in Kadugli and its suburb, include:  Gumaiyya Nafar Balal, Gumaiyya Nafar Ayyad, Gumaiyya Nafar Adam and others.  These who settled around the Deling city and its suburb are mostly Hawazma Dar Niayylie.   Both groups have adopted the mainstream Hawazma way of life and their Hawazma Arabic accents.  In terms of agricultural practices, they grow sorghum, sesame, cotton and okra.  They mostly use tools such as Sollucab for seeding and Antabab and axe for clearing shrubs and trees.  Mostly cultivate by uprooting grasses with their bare hands.  These are among the most victimized Hawazma during this civil wars.\nOn the southern parts of South Kordofan, settled Hawazma Al Rawawqa.  Al Rawawqa subtribe embodies large subsubtribal diversity.  Among the most prevalent are Rawawqa Oulad Nuba.  These are group of Hawazma who most resembles Nuba in most of their living habits and agricultural practices.  They cultivate with Jarrieh a Nuba developed tool, tend while sitting on their heels.  Mostly grow sorghum, sesame, and groundnuts and gather wild okra. Again these are among the most victimized Hawazma in the region.\n\nOn the eastern side of South Kordofan, lives Hawazma Darbettie, now separated from those living central South Kordofan, due to geographic distance.\nOn the western parts of South Kordofan, no Hawazma live their, it is found our cousins:  [[Messiria]], Humr, [[Rezeigat]], [[Ta'isha]] and Habbaniya.  They have similar lifestyles as Hawazma, and only differentiated by their phonetic accents of Arabic language.\n\n==Character, appearance and costumes==\n<!--[[Image:How They travel In Kordofan.jpg|thumb|right|300px| This photo seems taken during the early 19th century but still holds as of today.  The Hawazma in particular and [[Baggara]] in general travel by oxen during the rainy season. The long-shafted spear is characteristically for Baggara {{deletable image-caption|Saturday, December 18, 2010|date=December 2010}}]]-->\n\nHawazma, like any other [[Baggara]] people, have graceful slim physical statues; their skins range from light brown to dark colors.  Explorers{{Who|date=February 2012}} to the region motioned that they have far better mental capabilities, wit and humor than any other African tribes around them; they have passion for life and collective life style.  The men wear a white gown called Jallabiyya, white pants (pajamas), a head cap called ''tagiatt'', big white turbans called ''eema'' and locally made leather shoes called ''marqoub''.  Always men of all ages carry knives, which are worn on the forceps of the left arm and hidden in a decorated leather covering, carry sticks, spears, sometimes swords or big spears.  The women wear a dress called ''foustan'', and cover their bodies with taubes such as Indian sari.  Young men wear eye-catching colored flashy shirts, shorts, pants, beads, necklaces, and bracelets.  Young women wear ''foustanff'' during festivals and dancing to show their ornate braided hairstyles.\n\n==Sociological issues: gender, health and education==\nBaggara are mostly illiterate.  In the early days, they look to the school as a way to alienate their kids, to teach them moral delinquencies, to distract them from Baggara way of life: cattle herding and nomadic movement.  Young Baggara look after cows daylong, they return to Baggara camp during evening times. Baggara lack clean drinking water, health clinics, electricity, television, radio and other forms of media.  Pregnant women rarely visit clinics or doctors.  Female genital mutilation is common.  Facial scarring called Shoulokh, lips sticking, and braided hair are usual practices among women.\n\nWomen represent an important workforce; they milk cows, prepare meals, raise kids, market dairy products, build houses, and participate in crop cultivation.  Baggara youth are cheerful group in the Baggara families; their main mental set to look for festivals, rituals, dancing gossip around for absentinence and only supervises young kids to range cattle.  Men are completely idle during dry seasons, play Dala (sort of cards played with sticks) and coordinate the meager activity during summer such as delivering grains to mills and bringing the daily family grocery from women's marketed-dairy-product money.  Baggara raise huge herds, never for marketing, but for prestige.  The wealth and prestige is determined by the size of one's herds.  Women crush on those with large herds.

Most of the fighting were on the Hawazma area.  It has to be noted that all the area inhabited by Hawazma and [[Messiria]] also inhabited by [[Nuba]] tribes. Animosity between [[Baggara Arabs]] and [[Nuba]] was at its peak during 1985 - 2002.]] -->\n\nBeginning in early 1983, radio broadcasts by South Sudanese rebels alarmed the people of South Kordofan and increased tensions in the area.\n\nSoon after, weapons started to appear on the black market. The military started recalling retirees and drafting young men for service. The weapons trade was flourishing with gun sellers roaming the Baggara villages and nomad camps. A young man without a machine gun was just like a woman.  To be a man, you had to have a machine gun. The Baggara started to organize themselves as militia.  The militiamen given themselves roles to protect the Baggara camps and fight to defend the villages.\n\nNomeri's regime began arming [[Messiria]] Zurug and [[Messiria]] Humr to balance the rebel attack on [[Abyei]] area.  The rebels attacked a [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Oil Company]] site, killing four Chevron employees. Also, they attacked the Baggara campuses to acquire cattle for food.  Now the war completely broke at southwest of South Kordofan.  By the end of Normeri's regime, in 1985, South Kordofan was in chaos although other parts of Kordofan were peaceful.\n\nDuring, Al Sadiq Al Mahdi era, the [[Messiria]] Zurug and [[Messiria]] Humr were armored [http://protection.unsudanig.org/data/south/papers/african_rights/2war], the paramilitary forces became legal and carrying weapons was legal.  Everyone had [[AK-47]] machine gun.  During this time rebels attacked the southern part of South Kordofan, especially Gardoud village, around Talodi city.  The Baggara were heavily victimized in Gardoud;  sixty Baggara were dead, 82 wounded; see the first Paragraph in this report [http://protection.unsudanig.org/data/south/papers/african_rights/2war].  Religious leaders and Imams, were publicly executed, women were raped, houses were burned and cattle herds were raided.  South Kordofan now is a war zone.  People evacuated the cities, traders stopped their trades, and all other tribes and ethnic groups not from South Kordofan left the region.\n\n==Civil war==\nIn 1987, [[Yusif Kuwa Mekki]] entered South Kordofan as commander for the rebels [http://protection.unsudanig.org/data/south/papers/african_rights/2war].  Immediately war expanded to [[el Hamra]], [[el Buram]], [[Um Sirdiba]] and surrounding areas.  Hawazma villages were systematically targeted by rebels, killing them as groups, individuals or evacuated them completely as happened in Um Sirdiba. Africa Justice organization provided many reports documenting abuses by [[Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement|SPLA]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20081204103725/http://www.justiceafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/fg_05_spla_record.pdf].  These reports indicate the worse human rights situation in South Kordofan.\n\nIn 1989, Al Boukhas village was completely destroyed and about 40 villages of Hawazma were either attacked or evacuated before the attack and the people left their possessions and crops. By the end of 1989, about 300,000 Baggara were either relocated to big cities or displaced and resettled on the northern border of South Kordofan.  For six years, Kuwa war machines (six battalions) were directed to systematic torturing of Baggara tribes, completely destroying their infrastructures and eliminating their educated youth; leaders; and the elite.  We have not seen any major attack on military campuses or major military stronghold places in South Kordofan.  The war was directed toward Baggara tribesmen.\n\nIn January 1990 Abu Safifa village was burned to the ground. By February 1990, only Baggara men stayed on the villages while kids, women and the elderly were displaced or relocated.  The war became ethnic cleansings against the Baggara, while the west still misleaded with the NGOs, which look after their religious and political agenda in South Kordofan desperate tribal wars.  Rebel guerrilla fighters were looking for excitement in the news by destroying Baggara villages to show their presence, then escape to the mountains tops such as [[Morou Mountain]] or [[Tolishi Mountains]].\n\nNuba militia fighters found a breeding ground in the presence of rebels fighters.  Tarrevera militia fighters, from Morou, crossed the road for every vehicle; evacuating Baggara and executing them.  They placed road mines and ambushed cars.  When mines went off, they would attack; kill or loot goods and then they would escape to mountains or densely forested valleys.\n\nDuring the military regime of President [[Omar Hassan al-Bashir]], which came to power in June 1989, by revolting against elected Prime Minister Sadiq Al Mahdi government, South Kordofan entered a new phase of the civil war. Islamic jihad war against infidels was completely the norm of life in South Kordofan.  Religious decrees (Fatwas) were declared urging people to join the war [http://protection.unsudanig.org/data/south/papers/african_rights/2war].  Baggara are 100 percent Muslims and 75 percent of Nuba are Muslims. Then who was the Islamic war against?  However, due to desperation of Baggara, following the unspeakable atrocities by rebels, they sided with the military forces to protect themselves.  Soon, Yusuf Kuwa and rebels fighters realized the effect of Baggara on the war balance; basically attributed to their knowledge of the terrain and the intricacies of South Kordofan.  The Baggara lead the government forces to caves and hiding places for the rebels.  Rebels Commander [[Yusif Kuwa Mekki]] started to negotiate with Baggara [https://web.archive.org/web/20081021223857/http://www.ifaanet.org/ifaapr/nuba_conflict.htm], either to take side with him or at least to refrain from supporting the government army against the rebels.  Yusuf Kuwa succeeded in convening and writing many mutual agreements with local Baggara leaders.\n\nBaggara held good to their agreements.  This came to disadvantage the government.  The government, thereafter, started a full swing against Baggara, who hold to their agreements by jailing, torturing or killing or forcing them to refrain from any agreements.\n\nAs of today, with peace agreement in progress, Baggara has nothing to negotiate.  They were used, abused and victimized by the rebels and the Government forces. NGOs never came to Baggara villages to report the atrocities, and probably assumed not deserving any human rights.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Baggara]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081204103725/http://www.justiceafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/fg_05_spla_record.pdf African Justice] interviewed [[Yousif Kuwa Mekki]], he said, quote: \"If you look at our soldiers, most of them are not educated and not politically conscious, so you should expect that if someone like this has a gun in his hand, he feels he is powerful and can do whatever he wants.

Through their [[nomad]]ic movement, the Hawazma know the area, [[terrain]], [[ethnic group]]s, local tribes, tribal [[culture]]s, [[ecosystem]]s, [[climate]], [[vegetation]], existence of risks and [[disease]]s, and water resources better than any other inhabitants of the region. The term Baggara is a collective name applied to all cattle-herding tribes with [[Arab]] roots.  Cattle herders from [[Nuba]] tribes are not called Baggara.  Cattle herders of middle and eastern [[Sudan]], although they Arabic in roots, are also not Baggara.  The Baggara occupies a wide area, from [[Kurdufan|Kordofan]], Mid-Western Sudan, to [[Darfur]] in the far Western Sudan and extending to neighboring [[Chad]].  They are a collection of seven major tribes:  Hawazma, [[Humur|Messiria Humr]] [[Messiria]] Zurug, [[Rizeigat]], [[Ta\u2019isha]], [[Habbaniya people|Habbaniya]], [[Beni Halba]], [[Awlad Himayd]], and [[Beni Selam]].  All Baggara have close physical characteristics, [[costume]]s, [[dance]], [[religion]], [[food]], and in general a common [[culture]] and way of life.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Hawazma are believed to have migrated to Sudan during early days of [[Islam]]ic [[missionaries]] to Africa as part of [[Baggara]] [[Arabs]], perhaps as early as the 12th century.  Most [[historian]]s believe they belong to the  [[Guhayna]] group; a [[clan]] of [[Bedouin]] [[Arab]]s which migrated from [[Saudi Arabia]].  Hawazma traditional historians say they originally came from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] to [[Egypt]] then followed the [[Nile River|River Nile]] until they settled on [[Jebel Awliyya]] part of [[Khartoum]] Province and as the grazing land became scarce and overcrowded they gradually moved to Western Sudan.  These stories correspond well with the presence of scores of Hawazma in [[Kosti, Sudan|Kosti]], Middle Sudan, [[Um Rowaba]], Eastern part of Kordofan and [[Al Rahad]], middle-eastern part of Kordofan.  The journey continued beyond Kordofan, to Darfur on the Western Sudan and today they have reached [[Chad]], the country on western border of Sudan.\n\nWherever Baggara settle they start a seasonal nomadic movement that goes from north to south, in a Round-Robin fashion according to the season and perpendicular to their historical migration route.  Mostly they only follow two routes, one route from north to south and different route from south to north. But the routes are not far apart, and they are permanent, they never change them.  Any tribe has its own routes.  Hawazma are mostly found in routes originating from [[Al-Ubayyid|Al Obeid]] city in [[North Kurdufan]], through Deling city and its eastern part, [[Kadugli]] city and its eastern part, to [[Talodi]] region.  [[Messiria]] just borders them to the west.  Humr borders Messiria to the west. And so forth.\n\nToday the Hawazma in particular and Baggara in general bear little resemblance to Bedouin Arabs, due to their acclimatization and their inter-marriage with other African tribes.  Many Hawazma subtribes have dark skin, and closely resemble Nuba tribes.  And many members of these tribes speak Nuba dialects fluently.  Still some tribe names indicate their mixed origins. Other Hawazma subtribes have preserved their Arabic features: light brown complexion, and thick eyebrows and lashes.\n\n==Socio-economic factors: pastoralism and agriculture==\n[[Image:Baggara Arabs.jpg|thumb|right|300px|This picture typical of Hawazma [[Baggara]] when reach [[North Kurdufan]] in their north journey out of the muddy land of [[South Kordofan]]]]\nWhen Hawazma families lose their herds they settle.  Generally, Hawazma settled in [[village]]s or established villages from southern parts of Al Obeid city in Northern Kordofan to Talodi city in South Kordofan.  Those who settled in northern border of [[South Kordofan]] or Southern border of North Kordofan are mostly Gumaiyya, including:  Gumaiyya Kilaibab, Gumaiyya Al Hussienat, and Gumaiyya Matrafia, in addition to other Hawazma Oulad Gaboush and Dar Niayylie.  These subtribes intermarried with Bidaria and Mosabaat and other Kordofanian tribes.  Their lifestyle closely resembles the Kordofanian tribes.  Mostly engaged in raising crops and cattle.  Notably their Hawazma Arabic Accent is inclined to include Kordofanian Arabic accents.  Similarly, they adopted a way of cultivation, crop tending, and harvesting similar to those other Kordofanian tribes.  They used a long-handled spade called Jarrieh and Saloqqa, they tend their farm while standing, not similar to those of Hawazma deep in South Kordofan who tend while they are sitting on their heels.  Their crops include:  millet, watermelon, groundnuts, sesame and hibiscus.\n\n[[Image:Baggara Boys.jpg|thumb|right|300px|This picture typical of Hawazma [[Baggara]] cow boys, in [[North Kurdufan]] ]]\n\nThose who settled in the middle of South Kordofan in Kadugli and its suburb, include:  Gumaiyya Nafar Balal, Gumaiyya Nafar Ayyad, Gumaiyya Nafar Adam and others.  These who settled around the Deling city and its suburb are mostly Hawazma Dar Niayylie.   Both groups have adopted the mainstream Hawazma way of life and their Hawazma Arabic accents.  In terms of agricultural practices, they grow sorghum, sesame, cotton and okra.  They mostly use tools such as Sollucab for seeding and Antabab and axe for clearing shrubs and trees.  Mostly cultivate by uprooting grasses with their bare hands.  These are among the most victimized Hawazma during this civil wars.\nOn the southern parts of South Kordofan, settled Hawazma Al Rawawqa.  Al Rawawqa subtribe embodies large subsubtribal diversity.  Among the most prevalent are Rawawqa Oulad Nuba.  These are group of Hawazma who most resembles Nuba in most of their living habits and agricultural practices.  They cultivate with Jarrieh a Nuba developed tool, tend while sitting on their heels.  Mostly grow sorghum, sesame, and groundnuts and gather wild okra. Again these are among the most victimized Hawazma in the region.\n\nOn the eastern side of South Kordofan, lives Hawazma Darbettie, now separated from those living central South Kordofan, due to geographic distance.\nOn the western parts of South Kordofan, no Hawazma live their, it is found our cousins:  [[Messiria]], Humr, [[Rezeigat]], [[Ta'isha]] and Habbaniya.  They have similar lifestyles as Hawazma, and only differentiated by their phonetic accents of Arabic language.\n\n==Character, appearance and costumes==\n<!--[[Image:How They travel In Kordofan.jpg|thumb|right|300px| This photo seems taken during the early 19th century but still holds as of today.  The Hawazma in particular and [[Baggara]] in general travel by oxen during the rainy season. The long-shafted spear is characteristically for Baggara {{deletable image-caption|Saturday, December 18, 2010|date=December 2010}}]]-->\n\nHawazma, like any other [[Baggara]] people, have graceful slim physical statues; their skins range from light brown to dark colors.  Explorers{{Who|date=February 2012}} to the region motioned that they have far better mental capabilities, wit and humor than any other African tribes around them; they have passion for life and collective life style.  The men wear a white gown called Jallabiyya, white pants (pajamas), a head cap called ''tagiatt'', big white turbans called ''eema'' and locally made leather shoes called ''marqoub''.  Always men of all ages carry knives, which are worn on the forceps of the left arm and hidden in a decorated leather covering, carry sticks, spears, sometimes swords or big spears.  The women wear a dress called ''foustan'', and cover their bodies with taubes such as Indian sari.  Young men wear eye-catching colored flashy shirts, shorts, pants, beads, necklaces, and bracelets.  Young women wear ''foustanff'' during festivals and dancing to show their ornate braided hairstyles.\n\n==Sociological issues: gender, health and education==\nBaggara are mostly illiterate.  In the early days, they look to the school as a way to alienate their kids, to teach them moral delinquencies, to distract them from Baggara way of life: cattle herding and nomadic movement.  Young Baggara look after cows daylong, they return to Baggara camp during evening times. Baggara lack clean drinking water, health clinics, electricity, television, radio and other forms of media.  Pregnant women rarely visit clinics or doctors.  Female genital mutilation is common.  Facial scarring called Shoulokh, lips sticking, and braided hair are usual practices among women.\n\nWomen represent an important workforce; they milk cows, prepare meals, raise kids, market dairy products, build houses, and participate in crop cultivation.  Baggara youth are cheerful group in the Baggara families; their main mental set to look for festivals, rituals, dancing gossip around for absentinence and only supervises young kids to range cattle.  Men are completely idle during dry seasons, play Dala (sort of cards played with sticks) and coordinate the meager activity during summer such as delivering grains to mills and bringing the daily family grocery from women's marketed-dairy-product money.  Baggara raise huge herds, never for marketing, but for prestige.  The wealth and prestige is determined by the size of one's herds.  Women crush on those with large herds.

Most of the fighting were on the Hawazma area.  It has to be noted that all the area inhabited by Hawazma and [[Messiria]] also inhabited by [[Nuba]] tribes. Animosity between [[Baggara Arabs]] and [[Nuba]] was at its peak during 1985 - 2002.]] -->\n\nBeginning in early 1983, radio broadcasts by South Sudanese rebels alarmed the people of South Kordofan and increased tensions in the area.\n\nSoon after, weapons started to appear on the black market. The military started recalling retirees and drafting young men for service. The weapons trade was flourishing with gun sellers roaming the Baggara villages and nomad camps. A young man without a machine gun was just like a woman.  To be a man, you had to have a machine gun. The Baggara started to organize themselves as militia.  The militiamen given themselves roles to protect the Baggara camps and fight to defend the villages.\n\nNomeri's regime began arming [[Messiria]] Zurug and [[Messiria]] Humr to balance the rebel attack on [[Abyei]] area.  The rebels attacked a [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron Oil Company]] site, killing four Chevron employees. Also, they attacked the Baggara campuses to acquire cattle for food.  Now the war completely broke at southwest of South Kordofan.  By the end of Normeri's regime, in 1985, South Kordofan was in chaos although other parts of Kordofan were peaceful.\n\nDuring, Al Sadiq Al Mahdi era, the [[Messiria]] Zurug and [[Messiria]] Humr were armored [http://protection.unsudanig.org/data/south/papers/african_rights/2war], the paramilitary forces became legal and carrying weapons was legal.  Everyone had [[AK-47]] machine gun.  During this time rebels attacked the southern part of South Kordofan, especially Gardoud village, around Talodi city.  The Baggara were heavily victimized in Gardoud;  sixty Baggara were dead, 82 wounded; see the first Paragraph in this report [http://protection.unsudanig.org/data/south/papers/african_rights/2war].  Religious leaders and Imams, were publicly executed, women were raped, houses were burned and cattle herds were raided.  South Kordofan now is a war zone.  People evacuated the cities, traders stopped their trades, and all other tribes and ethnic groups not from South Kordofan left the region.\n\n==Civil war==\nIn 1987, [[Yusif Kuwa Mekki]] entered South Kordofan as commander for the rebels [http://protection.unsudanig.org/data/south/papers/african_rights/2war].  Immediately war expanded to [[el Hamra]], [[el Buram]], [[Um Sirdiba]] and surrounding areas.  Hawazma villages were systematically targeted by rebels, killing them as groups, individuals or evacuated them completely as happened in Um Sirdiba. Africa Justice organization provided many reports documenting abuses by [[Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement|SPLA]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20081204103725/http://www.justiceafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/fg_05_spla_record.pdf].  These reports indicate the worse human rights situation in South Kordofan.\n\nIn 1989, Al Boukhas village was completely destroyed and about 40 villages of Hawazma were either attacked or evacuated before the attack and the people left their possessions and crops. By the end of 1989, about 300,000 Baggara were either relocated to big cities or displaced and resettled on the northern border of South Kordofan.  For six years, Kuwa war machines (six battalions) were directed to systematic torturing of Baggara tribes, completely destroying their infrastructures and eliminating their educated youth; leaders; and the elite.  We have not seen any major attack on military campuses or major military stronghold places in South Kordofan.

Donna, believing that they are being fooled decides to dig a little deeper into the death of Jughead. At school, Cheryl creates a locker memorial for Jughead which makes Betty emotional. She runs to the music room, followed by Archie and they kiss. Cheryl tells Veronica; who angrily confronts them in the lounge. Donna follows Betty into Dilton\u2019s bunker that night to find her and Archie kissing. Knowing that Donna was following her, she hid a very alive Jughead under the cot as a diversion so Bret and Donna would crack under pressure. At home, Betty and Archie flirtatiously text and Hermosa finds evidence about Donna\u2019s identity to help take-down the Stonewall kids.\n | LineColor       = 5B94F6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber   = 73\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n | Title           = Chapter Seventy-Three: The Locked Room\n | DirectedBy      = Tessa Blake\n | WrittenBy       = Aaron Allen\n | OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|11}}\n | ProdCode        = T13.21866\n | Viewers         = 0.66<ref name=\"4.16\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-wednesday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-11-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Wednesday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.11.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 12, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 12, 2020}}</ref>\n | ShortSummary    = Jughead and Betty hold a locked room with the Stonewall kids and Mr. DuPont, explaining all. Mr. Chipping killed himself out of guilt as he orchestrated each student to commit the perfect murder. Whoever was assigned the ghostwriter job, would write their murder. Moose was supposed to be the murdered student. Betty and Jughead deduce that all four students had a hand in killing Jughead. Charles ordered the trio to burn their clothes and all evidence while he took Jughead in for injuries. Betty brings in Charles, FP, and Forsythe. Forsythe has been living in hiding, trying to prove Mr. DuPont murdered his original literary circle. Jughead was bait to lure out Forsythe so Mr. DuPont could finish the murder. DuPont kills himself to avoid jail, Joan leaves the country. Brett reveals the location of the tapes, while he faces charges. Betty blackmails Donna into disappearing, figuring out Donna's grandmother was murdered by DuPont, making her the mastermind behind everything.

Kevin wants to sing a song from the musical, Hedwig, at the school's Variety Show. Archie and the gang decide to sing as a band, however, Principal Honey believes the show to be too inappropriate. Hiram has been skipping his appointments which leads to him collapsing. Betty tutors Jughead, who is not taking it seriously and investigating the videotapes. Cheryl and Toni devise a plan to try to get Honey to accept the show, but he denies, threatening to ban students from Senior Prom. After a peaceful protest, Honey cancels the Variety Show. Veronica and Archie fight over Hiram going to the gym, just as Betty and Jughead fight over him taking school seriously. Only Archie and Betty show up to rehearsal, and they end up kissing. Later, Veronica and Jughead apologize for their blowup, as Betty and Archie look at each other nervously from their windows. Veronica hosts the Variety Show at La Bonne Nuit and the Archies perform there. Watching the tapes, Jughead sees a person tied up wearing a Jughead face mask who is brutally murdered by another person in a Betty face mask.\n | LineColor       = 5B94F6\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber   = 75\n | EpisodeNumber2  = 18\n | Title           = Chapter Seventy-Five: Lynchian\n | RTitle          = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20200416cw08/|title=(#418) \"Chapter Seventy-Five: Lynchian\"|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n | DirectedBy      = [[Steven A.
