At her debut in Yokai Academy's high school, she is immediately revered for her natural good looks and her academic ability, having placed in the teens (out of several hundred students) on one of their exams.{{Ref label|S1 v1|S1 v1}} Although she is good natured and kind, she possesses some naivety that draws her into problematic situations. Prior to the series, she is distrustful of humans, having spent much of her life in the human world, including middle school where she is shunned by her fellow students.{{Ref label|S1 v1|S1 v1}} After meeting Tsukune Aono, however, she begins to trust them.\n\nIn the manga's second serialization, Tsukune and the gang learn that Moka's appearance is that of her mother Akasha Bloodriver.{{Ref label|S2 v7|S2 v7}} When Tsukune and his friends look into Moka's past, they discover that the outer Moka is a pseudo-personality that Akasha creates using the rosario, with the purpose of preserving the blood seal on [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Alucard|Alucard]], and protecting Moka's inner personality while the latter is asleep.{{Ref label|S2 v8|s2 ch 34}} All of her memories pertaining to Alucard are wiped.{{Ref label|S2 v8|S2 ch 35}} In the final chapter, Akasha reveals that Outer Moka is a clone of herself but with her memories wiped so she can protect her daughter.{{Ref label|S2 v14|S2 ch 66.6}} After Akasha disappears, Moka's father later reveals that her personality is still with Moka as long as they have memories of her.{{Ref label|S2 epilogue|S2 epilogue}}\n\n===Inner Moka===\n[[Image:Inner Moka Akashiya.png|thumb|220px|Inner Moka, Moka's true vampiric form]]\nWhen the rosary around Moka's neck is removed, her inner vampiric personality emerges as {{nihongo|Inner Moka|\u88cf\u840c\u9999|Ura-Moka}}<ref name=\"OST\"/> a deeply aristocratic, aggressive and arrogant vampire woman. Her catchphrase at the end of a fight is {{nihongo|\"Learn your place\"|\u8eab\u306e\u7a0b\u3092\u77e5\u308c|Minohodo o shire|also \"Know your place\"}}.\n\nMoka's inner personality is shown to have a more feminine side when she spent a day with Tsukune, similar to the outer half.{{Ref label|S2 v4|S2 ch 16}} It is later revealed that Inner Moka is actually  Moka's true personality. As a newborn, she is injected with blood from Akasha in order to save her life. The \"First Ancestor\" blood that she acquires enables her to have tremendous strength and regeneration, but can only be acquired by transfusion and not by heredity. When Akasha is attacked and seemingly killed by her stepsister [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Aqua Shuzen|Aqua]], Moka snaps where her First Ancestor blood is awaken, which inadvertently awakens the Vampire Lord [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Alucard|Alucard]] as their blood is synchronized with him. To prevent her daughter from being eaten by Alucard so that she can have a normal life, Akasha uses a rosary to seal Moka's First Ancestor blood, and creates a pseudo-personality, \"Outer\" Moka, so that her inner personality can sleep. Akasha designs for Moka's inner personality to occasionally awaken when her rosario is removed by a person who truly cares about her.{{Ref label|S2 v8|S2 v8}}\n\n===Moka's Rosario===\nOnly Tsukune can remove the rosario safely, but Moka is also able, albeit with potentially fatal side-effects. Moka's rosary was the only thing that her mother left behind after she disappeared. It was originally believed that Moka's rosary sealed her true vampiric powers. However, when Moka and her friends went to Hong Kong to see Tohofuhai, the Second Dark Lord, about fixing the rosary, Tohofuhai discovered that the rosary does not actually seal Moka's powers. Much to his surprise, it seals away Moka's memories. The whole point of sealing Inner Moka is to seal away her First Ancestor Blood, which is linked to Alucard's powers, and can only be removed by a person who truly cares for her, in other words, Tsukune.{{Ref label|S2 v8|S2 ch 34}} In the anime adaptation, Moka manages to bypass her rosary seal after Ruby mortally wounds Tsukune during the Witch's Knoll arc, the emotional trauma causing her Inner personality to emerge without having Tsukune remove the seal.{{Ref label|S1 ep 10|S1 ep 10}} Also, if willed on by Moka, it can hold back the awakening of Alucard. She was also able to bypass the seal on her Rosario when witnessing what she thought to be Kurumu and Mizore slain by Aqua's Dimension Sword technique. That was what caused the seal to break, and gave Gyokuro the ability to forcefully remove her cross, when normally only Tsukune could.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Manga===\nIkeda draws Moka with long, pink hair and green eyes. Her inner personality, when manifested, is drawn with silver hair and red eyes. At the beginning of the series, Moka's inner personality mocks Tsukune for his personality, but as the series progresses, she shows an interest in Tsukune by letting him hold her hand in the manga, although this was done so he could learn how to sense when monsters such as her jealous classmates and friends attack.{{Ref label|S2 v4|S2 ch 16}} This is shown more in the anime when Moka's inner personality is left outside after her rosario is used to hold the barrier; she tries to act the same as her outer personality.{{Ref label|S2 ep 12|S2 ep 12}} Inner Moka has no experience in cooking: her attempts to cook a pumpkin pie prove disastrous, although when Tsukune tastes it he tells her he likes it, which makes her very happy.{{Ref label|S2 v6|S2 ch 26}} At the end of chapter 26 of the second serialization, the seal was broken sufficiently enough that Inner Moka has taken over the body and Outer Moka was forced into being the Inner personality, however the two can still converse via the rosario almost normally with each other.{{Ref label|S2 v7|S2 ch 26}} The seal was fixed in later chapters prior to Moka's captivity by Aqua as an emergency measure.\n\n===Anime===\nIn each of the episodes in the anime series, when Moka's rosario is removed, there is a transformation sequence where she becomes a \"super-vampire\".  She still has silver hair and red eyes with slit pupils, but undergoes physical changes to her body such as slightly larger hips and bust size.{{Ref label|S1 ep 1|S1 ep 1}} Her transformation is likened to those of [[magical girl]]s.{{Ref label|S1 ep 1|S1 ep 1}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://annesanimeblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/anime-review-rosario-vampire-season-1-wheee/ |title=Anime Review: Rosario + Vampire Season 1 (Wheee!) |work=Anne's Anime Blog |publisher=Annesanimeblog.wordpress.com |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=February 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303062149/http://annesanimeblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/anime-review-rosario-vampire-season-1-wheee/ |archive-date=March 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{better source|date=February 2014}} Her voice is deeper and more serious, and in the English version, she is voiced by a different voice actor.{{Ref label|S1 ep 1|S1 ep 1}} Following her fights as Inner Moka, the bat character announces the duration of Moka's fight.<ref name=\"them\"/> Her appearance resembles that of her father, Issa Shuzen.\n\n==Character songs==\n\nMoka's first character single, sung by [[Nana Mizuki]] and containing songs {{Nihongo3|Red passion| \u8d64\u3044\u60c5\u71b1|Akai j\u014dnetsu}} and {{Nihongo3|Red sweetpea|\u8d64\u3044\u30b9\u30a4\u30fc\u30c8\u30d4\u30fc|Akai su\u012btop\u012b}}, debuted at number 42 on the [[Oricon]] weekly chart.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/w/2008-02-25/more/6/ | title=2008\u5e7402\u670811\u65e5\uff5e2008\u5e7402\u670817\u65e5\u306eCD\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u9031\u9593\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 | publisher=[[Oricon]] | accessdate=February 7, 2014 | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305114613/http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/w/2008-02-25/more/6/ | archive-date=March 5, 2014 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> and remained on the chart for four weeks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/223926/products/music/746117/1/ | script-title=ja:\u300c\u30ed\u30b6\u30ea\u30aa\u3068\u30d0\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u300d\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30bd\u30f3\u30b0 1 \u8d64\u591c\u840c\u9999 | publisher=Oricon | accessdate=February 7, 2014 | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305103029/http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/223926/products/music/746117/1/ | archive-date=March 5, 2014 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Her character single for the second anime series, containing songs {{Nihongo3|The Kapu Chu to you!|\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306b\u30ab\u30d7\u30c3\uff43\uff48\uff55\uff01|Anata ni kapu~tsu ch\u016b!}} and {{Nihongo3|Desire -passion-|\uff24\uff25\uff33\uff29\uff32\uff25\u3000\uff0d\u60c5\u71b1\uff0d|Dezaia - j\u014dnetsu   }} reached number 40,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/w/2008-11-10/more/5/ | title=2008\u5e7410\u670827\u65e5\uff5e2008\u5e7411\u670802\u65e5\u306eCD\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u9031\u9593\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 | publisher=Oricon | accessdate=February 7, 2014 | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305114617/http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/w/2008-11-10/more/5/ | archive-date=March 5, 2014 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> and remained for a total of three weeks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/223926/products/music/785164/1/ | title=TV\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u300c\u30ed\u30b6\u30ea\u30aa\u3068\u30d0\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2CAPU2\u300d\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30bd\u30f3\u30b0 1 \u8d64\u591c\u840c\u9999 | publisher=Oricon | accessdate=February 7, 2014 | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305103035/http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/223926/products/music/785164/1/ | archive-date=March 5, 2014 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n<!-- POPULARITY; Beyond the single chart, you can add polls, merchandise, and (if existent) voice actor award(s) or her commentaries on character -->\n\n<!-- REVIEWS -->\nIn reviewing the first anime series, Stig H\u00f8gset of THEM Anime Reviews criticized Outer Moka to be ditzy and a \"pink-haired dolt\", with no attention to the usual vampire tropes such as exposure to sunlight, garlic and water, the last of which was explained that Moka is only vulnerable to pure water.

At her debut in Yokai Academy's high school, she is immediately revered for her natural good looks and her academic ability, having placed in the teens (out of several hundred students) on one of their exams.{{Ref label|S1 v1|S1 v1}} Although she is good natured and kind, she possesses some naivety that draws her into problematic situations. Prior to the series, she is distrustful of humans, having spent much of her life in the human world, including middle school where she is shunned by her fellow students.{{Ref label|S1 v1|S1 v1}} After meeting Tsukune Aono, however, she begins to trust them.\n\nIn the manga's second serialization, Tsukune and the gang learn that Moka's appearance is that of her mother Akasha Bloodriver.{{Ref label|S2 v7|S2 v7}} When Tsukune and his friends look into Moka's past, they discover that the outer Moka is a pseudo-personality that Akasha creates using the rosario, with the purpose of preserving the blood seal on [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Alucard|Alucard]], and protecting Moka's inner personality while the latter is asleep.{{Ref label|S2 v8|s2 ch 34}} All of her memories pertaining to Alucard are wiped.{{Ref label|S2 v8|S2 ch 35}} In the final chapter, Akasha reveals that Outer Moka is a clone of herself but with her memories wiped so she can protect her daughter.{{Ref label|S2 v14|S2 ch 66.6}} After Akasha disappears, Moka's father later reveals that her personality is still with Moka as long as they have memories of her.{{Ref label|S2 epilogue|S2 epilogue}}\n\n===Inner Moka===\n[[Image:Inner Moka Akashiya.png|thumb|220px|Inner Moka, Moka's true vampiric form]]\nWhen the rosary around Moka's neck is removed, her inner vampiric personality emerges as {{nihongo|Inner Moka|\u88cf\u840c\u9999|Ura-Moka}}<ref name=\"OST\"/> a deeply aristocratic, aggressive and arrogant vampire woman. Her catchphrase at the end of a fight is {{nihongo|\"Learn your place\"|\u8eab\u306e\u7a0b\u3092\u77e5\u308c|Minohodo o shire|also \"Know your place\"}}.\n\nMoka's inner personality is shown to have a more feminine side when she spent a day with Tsukune, similar to the outer half.{{Ref label|S2 v4|S2 ch 16}} It is later revealed that Inner Moka is actually  Moka's true personality. As a newborn, she is injected with blood from Akasha in order to save her life. The \"First Ancestor\" blood that she acquires enables her to have tremendous strength and regeneration, but can only be acquired by transfusion and not by heredity. When Akasha is attacked and seemingly killed by her stepsister [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Aqua Shuzen|Aqua]], Moka snaps where her First Ancestor blood is awaken, which inadvertently awakens the Vampire Lord [[List of Rosario + Vampire characters#Alucard|Alucard]] as their blood is synchronized with him. To prevent her daughter from being eaten by Alucard so that she can have a normal life, Akasha uses a rosary to seal Moka's First Ancestor blood, and creates a pseudo-personality, \"Outer\" Moka, so that her inner personality can sleep. Akasha designs for Moka's inner personality to occasionally awaken when her rosario is removed by a person who truly cares about her.{{Ref label|S2 v8|S2 v8}}\n\n===Moka's Rosario===\nOnly Tsukune can remove the rosario safely, but Moka is also able, albeit with potentially fatal side-effects. Moka's rosary was the only thing that her mother left behind after she disappeared. It was originally believed that Moka's rosary sealed her true vampiric powers. However, when Moka and her friends went to Hong Kong to see Tohofuhai, the Second Dark Lord, about fixing the rosary, Tohofuhai discovered that the rosary does not actually seal Moka's powers. Much to his surprise, it seals away Moka's memories. The whole point of sealing Inner Moka is to seal away her First Ancestor Blood, which is linked to Alucard's powers, and can only be removed by a person who truly cares for her, in other words, Tsukune.{{Ref label|S2 v8|S2 ch 34}} In the anime adaptation, Moka manages to bypass her rosary seal after Ruby mortally wounds Tsukune during the Witch's Knoll arc, the emotional trauma causing her Inner personality to emerge without having Tsukune remove the seal.{{Ref label|S1 ep 10|S1 ep 10}} Also, if willed on by Moka, it can hold back the awakening of Alucard. She was also able to bypass the seal on her Rosario when witnessing what she thought to be Kurumu and Mizore slain by Aqua's Dimension Sword technique. That was what caused the seal to break, and gave Gyokuro the ability to forcefully remove her cross, when normally only Tsukune could.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Manga===\nIkeda draws Moka with long, pink hair and green eyes. Her inner personality, when manifested, is drawn with silver hair and red eyes. At the beginning of the series, Moka's inner personality mocks Tsukune for his personality, but as the series progresses, she shows an interest in Tsukune by letting him hold her hand in the manga, although this was done so he could learn how to sense when monsters such as her jealous classmates and friends attack.{{Ref label|S2 v4|S2 ch 16}} This is shown more in the anime when Moka's inner personality is left outside after her rosario is used to hold the barrier; she tries to act the same as her outer personality.{{Ref label|S2 ep 12|S2 ep 12}} Inner Moka has no experience in cooking: her attempts to cook a pumpkin pie prove disastrous, although when Tsukune tastes it he tells her he likes it, which makes her very happy.{{Ref label|S2 v6|S2 ch 26}} At the end of chapter 26 of the second serialization, the seal was broken sufficiently enough that Inner Moka has taken over the body and Outer Moka was forced into being the Inner personality, however the two can still converse via the rosario almost normally with each other.{{Ref label|S2 v7|S2 ch 26}} The seal was fixed in later chapters prior to Moka's captivity by Aqua as an emergency measure.\n\n===Anime===\nIn each of the episodes in the anime series, when Moka's rosario is removed, there is a transformation sequence where she becomes a \"super-vampire\".  She still has silver hair and red eyes with slit pupils, but undergoes physical changes to her body such as slightly larger hips and bust size.{{Ref label|S1 ep 1|S1 ep 1}} Her transformation is likened to those of [[magical girl]]s.{{Ref label|S1 ep 1|S1 ep 1}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://annesanimeblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/anime-review-rosario-vampire-season-1-wheee/ |title=Anime Review: Rosario + Vampire Season 1 (Wheee!) |work=Anne's Anime Blog |publisher=Annesanimeblog.wordpress.com |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=February 9, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303062149/http://annesanimeblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/anime-review-rosario-vampire-season-1-wheee/ |archive-date=March 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{better source|date=February 2014}} Her voice is deeper and more serious, and in the English version, she is voiced by a different voice actor.{{Ref label|S1 ep 1|S1 ep 1}} Following her fights as Inner Moka, the bat character announces the duration of Moka's fight.<ref name=\"them\"/> Her appearance resembles that of her father, Issa Shuzen.\n\n==Character songs==\n\nMoka's first character single, sung by [[Nana Mizuki]] and containing songs {{Nihongo3|Red passion| \u8d64\u3044\u60c5\u71b1|Akai j\u014dnetsu}} and {{Nihongo3|Red sweetpea|\u8d64\u3044\u30b9\u30a4\u30fc\u30c8\u30d4\u30fc|Akai su\u012btop\u012b}}, debuted at number 42 on the [[Oricon]] weekly chart.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/w/2008-02-25/more/6/ | title=2008\u5e7402\u670811\u65e5\uff5e2008\u5e7402\u670817\u65e5\u306eCD\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u9031\u9593\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 | publisher=[[Oricon]] | accessdate=February 7, 2014 | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305114613/http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/w/2008-02-25/more/6/ | archive-date=March 5, 2014 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> and remained on the chart for four weeks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/223926/products/music/746117/1/ | script-title=ja:\u300c\u30ed\u30b6\u30ea\u30aa\u3068\u30d0\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u300d\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30bd\u30f3\u30b0 1 \u8d64\u591c\u840c\u9999 | publisher=Oricon | accessdate=February 7, 2014 | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305103029/http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/223926/products/music/746117/1/ | archive-date=March 5, 2014 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Her character single for the second anime series, containing songs {{Nihongo3|The Kapu Chu to you!|\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306b\u30ab\u30d7\u30c3\uff43\uff48\uff55\uff01|Anata ni kapu~tsu ch\u016b!}} and {{Nihongo3|Desire -passion-|\uff24\uff25\uff33\uff29\uff32\uff25\u3000\uff0d\u60c5\u71b1\uff0d|Dezaia - j\u014dnetsu   }} reached number 40,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/w/2008-11-10/more/5/ | title=2008\u5e7410\u670827\u65e5\uff5e2008\u5e7411\u670802\u65e5\u306eCD\u30b7\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\u9031\u9593\u30e9\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0 | publisher=Oricon | accessdate=February 7, 2014 | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305114617/http://www.oricon.co.jp/rank/js/w/2008-11-10/more/5/ | archive-date=March 5, 2014 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> and remained for a total of three weeks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/223926/products/music/785164/1/ | title=TV\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u300c\u30ed\u30b6\u30ea\u30aa\u3068\u30d0\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2CAPU2\u300d\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u30bd\u30f3\u30b0 1 \u8d64\u591c\u840c\u9999 | publisher=Oricon | accessdate=February 7, 2014 | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305103035/http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/223926/products/music/785164/1/ | archive-date=March 5, 2014 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n<!-- POPULARITY; Beyond the single chart, you can add polls, merchandise, and (if existent) voice actor award(s) or her commentaries on character -->\n\n<!-- REVIEWS -->\nIn reviewing the first anime series, Stig H\u00f8gset of THEM Anime Reviews criticized Outer Moka to be ditzy and a \"pink-haired dolt\", with no attention to the usual vampire tropes such as exposure to sunlight, garlic and water, the last of which was explained that Moka is only vulnerable to pure water.

The number of experience gained is based on various factors including the number of opponents destroyed, killstreak and the amount of XP earned throughout the match. The amount of XP players gain has its own set of rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game.\n\nPlayers can also buy X Crystals. X Crystals are a premium currency, which is bought with real world money, and unlocks special skins, graffiti, special shell colors for turret ammo, paints for tanks and containers for module blueprints. X crystals can also be earned by completing missions and entering certain promo codes.\n\n=== Ranked Battles ===\nThe ranked battle system is a ranking ladder which organizes players using RP (reputation points), which are rewarded or lost at the end of a completed battle. These points place players within a certain league, depending on how much RP they have. From lowest to highest, there are 5 leagues: Training, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Masters. Upon entering a league for the first time, the game will grant players with the paint and 5 containers for the corresponding league. Every 2 months, the league system enters a new season. At that time, the game will award players with crystals, x crystals, and league containers for the league they ended the season in.

Five F-1 engines were used in the [[S-IC]] first stage of each [[Saturn V]], which served as the main launch vehicle of the [[Apollo program]]. The F-1 remains the most powerful single [[combustion chamber]] [[liquid-propellant rocket]] engine ever developed.<ref>W.

The E-1, although successfully tested in static firing, was quickly seen as a technological dead-end, and was abandoned for the larger, more powerful F-1. The Air Force eventually halted development of the F-1 because of a lack of requirement for such a large engine. However, the recently created [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) appreciated the usefulness of an engine with so much power and contracted Rocketdyne to complete its development. Test firings of F-1 components had been performed as early as 1957. The first static firing of a full-stage developmental F-1 was performed in March 1959. The first F-1 was delivered to NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center|MSFC]] in October 1963. In December 1964, the F-1 completed flight rating tests. Testing continued at least through 1965.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/Background_F-1_Rocket_Engine.pdf |title=NASA Rocketdyne document |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>\n\nEarly development tests revealed serious [[combustion instability]] problems which sometimes caused [[catastrophic failure]].<ref>{{Citation\n |first       = Renea\n |last        = Ellison\n |first2      = Marlow\n |last2       = Moser\n |title       = Combustion Instability Analysis and the Effects of Drop Size on Acoustic Driving Rocket Flow\n |place       = Huntsville, Alabama\n |publisher   = Propulsion Research Center, University of Alabama in Huntsville\n |url         = http://reap.uah.edu/publications/Ellison.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060907050809/http://reap.uah.edu/publications/Ellison.pdf\n |archivedate = 2006-09-07\n}}</ref> Initially, progress on this problem was slow, as it was intermittent and unpredictable. Oscillations of 4&nbsp;kHz with harmonics to 24&nbsp;kHz were observed. Eventually, engineers developed a diagnostic technique of detonating small explosive charges (which they called \"bombs\") outside the combustion chamber, through a tangential tube (RDX, C4 or black powder were used) while the engine was firing. This allowed them to determine exactly how the running chamber responded to variations in pressure, and to determine how to nullify these oscillations. The designers could then quickly experiment with different co-axial fuel-injector designs to obtain the one most resistant to instability. These problems were addressed from 1959 through 1961. Eventually, engine combustion was so stable, it would [[Damping ratio|self-damp]] artificially induced instability within one-tenth of a second.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:SaturnF1EngineDiagram.png|thumb|right|F-1 rocket engine components]]\n\nThe F-1 engine is the most powerful single-nozzle [[Liquid rocket|liquid-fueled rocket engine]] ever flown. The [[M-1 (rocket engine)|M-1 rocket engine]] was designed to have more thrust, but it was only tested at the component level. Also, the [[RD-170]] produces more thrust, but has four nozzles. The F-1 burned [[RP-1]] (rocket grade [[kerosene]]) as the fuel and used [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) as the oxidizer. A [[turbopump]] was used to inject fuel and oxygen into the combustion chamber. \n\nOne notable challenge in the construction of the F-1 was [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] of the thrust chamber. Chemical engineer Dennis \u201cDan\u201d Brevik was faced with the task of ensuring the preliminary [[combustion chamber]] tube bundle and [[manifold]] design produced by Al Bokstellar would run cool. In essence, Brevik\u2019s job was to \u201cmake sure it doesn\u2019t melt.\u201d Through Brevik\u2019s calculations of the [[hydrodynamic]] and [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] characteristics of the F-1, he and his team were able to fix an issue known as \u2018starvation\u2019. This is when an unbalance of static pressure leads to 'hot spots' in the manifolds. The material used for the F-1 thrust chamber tube bundle, reinforcing bands and manifold was [[Inconel|Inconel-X750]], a refractory nickel based alloy capable of withstanding high temperatures. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387096292|title=The Saturn V F-1 Engine: Powering Apollo into History|last=Young|first=Anthony|date=2008|publisher=Praxis|isbn=978-0-387-09629-2|series=Space Exploration|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe heart of the engine was the thrust chamber, which mixed and burned the fuel and oxidizer to produce thrust. A domed chamber at the top of the engine served as a [[Manifold (general engineering)|manifold]] supplying liquid oxygen to the [[Liquid-propellant rocket#Injectors|injectors]], and also served as a mount for the [[gimbal]] bearing which transmitted the thrust to the body of the rocket. Below this dome were the injectors, which directed fuel and oxidizer into the thrust chamber in a way designed to promote mixing and combustion.  Fuel was supplied to the injectors from a separate manifold; some of the fuel first traveled in 178 tubes down the length of the thrust chamber \u2014 which formed approximately the upper half of the [[Rocket engine nozzle|exhaust nozzle]] \u2014 and back in order to cool the nozzle.\n\nA [[gas-generator cycle|gas generator]] was used to drive a [[turbine]] which drove separate fuel and oxygen pumps, each feeding the thrust chamber assembly. The turbine was driven at 5,500 [[revolutions per minute|RPM]], producing {{convert|55000|bhp|MW}}. The fuel pump delivered {{convert|15,471|gal|l|abbr=off}} of RP-1 per minute while the oxidizer pump delivered {{convert|24,811|gal|l|abbr=on}} of liquid oxygen per minute. Environmentally, the turbopump was required to withstand temperatures ranging from input gas at {{convert|1500|F|-1}} to liquid oxygen at {{convert|\u2212300|F|0}}. Structurally, fuel was used to lubricate and cool the turbine [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]].\n\n[[File:F-1 Engine Test Firing.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Test firing of an F-1 engine at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]]]\nBelow the thrust chamber was the [[nozzle extension]], roughly half the length of the engine. This extension increased the [[Rocket engine#Propellant efficiency|expansion ratio]] of the engine from 10:1 to 16:1.  The exhaust from the turbopump was fed into the nozzle extension by a large, tapered manifold; this relatively cool gas formed a film which protected the nozzle extension from the hot ({{convert|5800|F|-1}}) exhaust gas.<ref name=SVPressKit>{{Citation\n |date= December 1968\n |title= Saturn V News Reference: F-1 Engine Fact Sheet\n |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n |url= http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/F-1_Engine.pdf\n |pages= 3\u20133, 3\u20134\n |accessdate= 2008-06-01\n}}</ref>\n\nEach second, a single F-1 burned {{convert|5683|lb}} of oxidizer and fuel: {{convert|3945|lb|abbr=on}} of liquid oxygen and {{convert|1738|lb|abbr=on}} of RP-1, generating {{convert|1500000|lbf|MN tf|abbr=on}} of thrust.

The cleaning procedure involved pumping TCE through the engine's fuel system and letting the solvent overflow for a period ranging from several seconds to 30\u201335 minutes, depending upon the engine and the severity of the deposits.

The E-1, although successfully tested in static firing, was quickly seen as a technological dead-end, and was abandoned for the larger, more powerful F-1. The Air Force eventually halted development of the F-1 because of a lack of requirement for such a large engine. However, the recently created [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) appreciated the usefulness of an engine with so much power and contracted Rocketdyne to complete its development. Test firings of F-1 components had been performed as early as 1957. The first static firing of a full-stage developmental F-1 was performed in March 1959. The first F-1 was delivered to NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center|MSFC]] in October 1963. In December 1964, the F-1 completed flight rating tests. Testing continued at least through 1965.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/Background_F-1_Rocket_Engine.pdf |title=NASA Rocketdyne document |date= |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>\n\nEarly development tests revealed serious [[combustion instability]] problems which sometimes caused [[catastrophic failure]].<ref>{{Citation\n |first       = Renea\n |last        = Ellison\n |first2      = Marlow\n |last2       = Moser\n |title       = Combustion Instability Analysis and the Effects of Drop Size on Acoustic Driving Rocket Flow\n |place       = Huntsville, Alabama\n |publisher   = Propulsion Research Center, University of Alabama in Huntsville\n |url         = http://reap.uah.edu/publications/Ellison.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060907050809/http://reap.uah.edu/publications/Ellison.pdf\n |archivedate = 2006-09-07\n}}</ref> Initially, progress on this problem was slow, as it was intermittent and unpredictable. Oscillations of 4&nbsp;kHz with harmonics to 24&nbsp;kHz were observed. Eventually, engineers developed a diagnostic technique of detonating small explosive charges (which they called \"bombs\") outside the combustion chamber, through a tangential tube (RDX, C4 or black powder were used) while the engine was firing. This allowed them to determine exactly how the running chamber responded to variations in pressure, and to determine how to nullify these oscillations. The designers could then quickly experiment with different co-axial fuel-injector designs to obtain the one most resistant to instability. These problems were addressed from 1959 through 1961. Eventually, engine combustion was so stable, it would [[Damping ratio|self-damp]] artificially induced instability within one-tenth of a second.\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:SaturnF1EngineDiagram.png|thumb|right|F-1 rocket engine components]]\n\nThe F-1 engine is the most powerful single-nozzle [[Liquid rocket|liquid-fueled rocket engine]] ever flown. The [[M-1 (rocket engine)|M-1 rocket engine]] was designed to have more thrust, but it was only tested at the component level. Also, the [[RD-170]] produces more thrust, but has four nozzles. The F-1 burned [[RP-1]] (rocket grade [[kerosene]]) as the fuel and used [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) as the oxidizer. A [[turbopump]] was used to inject fuel and oxygen into the combustion chamber. \n\nOne notable challenge in the construction of the F-1 was [[Regenerative cooling (rocket)|regenerative cooling]] of the thrust chamber. Chemical engineer Dennis \u201cDan\u201d Brevik was faced with the task of ensuring the preliminary [[combustion chamber]] tube bundle and [[manifold]] design produced by Al Bokstellar would run cool. In essence, Brevik\u2019s job was to \u201cmake sure it doesn\u2019t melt.\u201d Through Brevik\u2019s calculations of the [[hydrodynamic]] and [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] characteristics of the F-1, he and his team were able to fix an issue known as \u2018starvation\u2019. This is when an unbalance of static pressure leads to 'hot spots' in the manifolds. The material used for the F-1 thrust chamber tube bundle, reinforcing bands and manifold was [[Inconel|Inconel-X750]], a refractory nickel based alloy capable of withstanding high temperatures. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387096292|title=The Saturn V F-1 Engine: Powering Apollo into History|last=Young|first=Anthony|date=2008|publisher=Praxis|isbn=978-0-387-09629-2|series=Space Exploration|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe heart of the engine was the thrust chamber, which mixed and burned the fuel and oxidizer to produce thrust. A domed chamber at the top of the engine served as a [[Manifold (general engineering)|manifold]] supplying liquid oxygen to the [[Liquid-propellant rocket#Injectors|injectors]], and also served as a mount for the [[gimbal]] bearing which transmitted the thrust to the body of the rocket. Below this dome were the injectors, which directed fuel and oxidizer into the thrust chamber in a way designed to promote mixing and combustion.  Fuel was supplied to the injectors from a separate manifold; some of the fuel first traveled in 178 tubes down the length of the thrust chamber \u2014 which formed approximately the upper half of the [[Rocket engine nozzle|exhaust nozzle]] \u2014 and back in order to cool the nozzle.\n\nA [[gas-generator cycle|gas generator]] was used to drive a [[turbine]] which drove separate fuel and oxygen pumps, each feeding the thrust chamber assembly. The turbine was driven at 5,500 [[revolutions per minute|RPM]], producing {{convert|55000|bhp|MW}}. The fuel pump delivered {{convert|15,471|gal|l|abbr=off}} of RP-1 per minute while the oxidizer pump delivered {{convert|24,811|gal|l|abbr=on}} of liquid oxygen per minute. Environmentally, the turbopump was required to withstand temperatures ranging from input gas at {{convert|1500|F|-1}} to liquid oxygen at {{convert|\u2212300|F|0}}. Structurally, fuel was used to lubricate and cool the turbine [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]].\n\n[[File:F-1 Engine Test Firing.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Test firing of an F-1 engine at [[Edwards Air Force Base]]]]\nBelow the thrust chamber was the [[nozzle extension]], roughly half the length of the engine. This extension increased the [[Rocket engine#Propellant efficiency|expansion ratio]] of the engine from 10:1 to 16:1.  The exhaust from the turbopump was fed into the nozzle extension by a large, tapered manifold; this relatively cool gas formed a film which protected the nozzle extension from the hot ({{convert|5800|F|-1}}) exhaust gas.<ref name=SVPressKit>{{Citation\n |date= December 1968\n |title= Saturn V News Reference: F-1 Engine Fact Sheet\n |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n |url= http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/F-1_Engine.pdf\n |pages= 3\u20133, 3\u20134\n |accessdate= 2008-06-01\n}}</ref>\n\nEach second, a single F-1 burned {{convert|5683|lb}} of oxidizer and fuel: {{convert|3945|lb|abbr=on}} of liquid oxygen and {{convert|1738|lb|abbr=on}} of RP-1, generating {{convert|1500000|lbf|MN tf|abbr=on}} of thrust.

The cleaning procedure involved pumping TCE through the engine's fuel system and letting the solvent overflow for a period ranging from several seconds to 30\u201335 minutes, depending upon the engine and the severity of the deposits.

The main character of the series is [[#Tsukune Aono|Tsukune Aono]], a teenage boy who, after not getting accepted to any local high schools, enrolls in Yokai Academy, a boarding school for monsters. He meets [[Moka Akashiya]], a [[vampire]] who soon takes a liking to the sweet taste of his blood, and throughout the series, befriends and attracts a variety of monster girls including: [[#Kurumu Kurono|Kurumu Kurono]], a [[succubus]]; [[#Yukari Sendo|Yukari Sendo]] and [[#Ruby Tojo|Ruby Tojo]], who are witches; and [[#Mizore Shirayuki|Mizore Shirayuki]], a [[yuki-onna|snow fairy]].<ref name=\"Funimation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/rosario-vampire|title=Rosario + Vampire|publisher=[[Funimation Entertainment]]|accessdate=March 15, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425072548/http://www.funimation.com/rosario-vampire|archive-date=April 25, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> While protecting Tsukune's identity as a human, they join the school's Newspaper Club; they wind up fighting a variety of monster gangs as well as some teachers. In the second manga serialization, the Newspaper Club faces more monster characters and a larger organization known as Fairy Tale, whose members include Moka's own family.<ref name=\"square\"/>\n\nIn developing the characters for the series, Ikeda cited influences from [[Tim Burton]]'s works, and research on various monsters from encyclopedias and the Internet. The characters have been commented on by reviewers, who had mixed feelings about Ikeda's artwork, but criticized the character development and its missed potential. The anime adaptation received negative criticism for its fanservice, and mixed reviews for other aspects such as voice acting. Characters have also featured in various merchandise, character songs and polls.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Conception and development==\nIkeda drew inspirations from ''[[Kaibutsu-kun]]'' and has incorporated some references later into the first serialization of the ''Rosario + Vampire'' manga. In an interview at [[Lucca Comics & Games|Lucca Comics]] 2012, Ikeda said he is a big fan of [[Tim Burton]] and was inspired by his works, including ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and particularly ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' because the monster has a sensitive soul. He had also researched various monsters from encyclopedias and the Internet. He started with his passion for vampires, and the concept of a beautiful girl vampire with a crucifix around her neck and then created the school of monsters, Tsukune, and others afterwards. He credits the beautiful girls for the series' popularity and added the fighting elements.<ref name=\"nanodainterview\"/>\n\nIkeda has mentioned that he has great respect for real-life teachers, so he designed the monster ones to contrast that and be more comical.<ref name=\"nanodainterview\"/> He also introduced [[#Fangfang Huang|Fangfang Huang]] to increase the number of male characters and to attract more female readers. He created a male counterpart that looks feminine to increase the comic element. During the development of ''Season II'', he also acknowledged that the series would have a finite ending.<ref name=\"nanodainterview\"/> He introduced [[#San Otonashi|San Otonashi]] to reflect the feelings and struggles of young people as they ponder their futures and transitioning into the working world.{{Ref label|S2 v5|S2 v5 author's notes}} In ''Season II, Volume 8'', he noted that he had to postpone the publishing date because he took so much time in drawing it.{{Ref label|S2 v8|S2 v8 author's notes}} In ''Season II, Volume 11'', he mentions his favorite manga characters from other series are: [[Dio Brando|Dio]] (''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure]]''), [[Younger Toguro|Toguro]] (''[[Yu Yu Hakusho]]''), [[Ushio and Tora#Hakumenn No Mono|Hakumen]] (''[[Ushio and Tora|Ushio To Tora]]''), and [[Shigurui#Kogan Iwamoto|Master Kogan]] (''[[Shigurui]]'') - the villains who \"have an inimitable style and play by their own rules. They're powerful and dark, but there's something melancholy about them too as well...and that's what draws me to them.\" He hopes his villains ([[#Aqua Shuzen|Aqua]], [[#Gyokuro Shuzen|Gyokuro]], [[#Miyabi Fujisaki|Miyabi]], [[#Kiria Yoshi|Kiria]], and others) would draw readers.{{Ref label|S2 v11|S2 v11 author's notes}}\n\n==Protagonists==\n{{anchor|Newspaper Club}}\nThe main protagonists are club members of the school's newspaper, the ''Yokai Times'' (anime: ''Yokai Gazette'').

He found the girls \"distinctive, if predictable (the beauty, the boobs, the jailbait)\",<ref name=\"santos gn5\"/> but concluded in a later volume that \"The story's never going to go anywhere, the characters are never going to go anywhere, and the artwork is always going to have that same polished-but-flawed look.\"<ref name=\"santos gn9\"/> Stig H\u00f8gset of THEM Anime Reviews found Moka to be ditzy and a \"pink-haired dolt\"; he criticized her lack of vampire weaknesses such as walking around in broad daylight at a beach, but found her alternate personality as \"pretty damn badass\", \"a great addition to the show, if a severely underutilized one\", and wished that her character was developed better.<ref name=\"them\"/> Deb Aoki of About.com called Moka a magical ditz who loves the doofus but also kicks butt.<ref name=\"about1\">{{cite web |last=Aoki |first=Deb |url=http://manga.about.com/od/vizmedia/gr/RosarioVampire1.htm |title=Rosario + Vampire Volume 1 by Akihisa Ikeda \u2013 Shonen Jump Advanced / VIZ Media \u2013 Rosario + Vampire Volume 1 Manga Review |work=Manga at About.com |date=2013-12-18 |accessdate=2014-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140411195837/http://manga.about.com/od/vizmedia/gr/RosarioVampire1.htm |archive-date=2014-04-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Neil Lumbard of [[DVD Talk]] noted that [[#Koko Shuzen|Kokoa]] is not another character that has a massive crush on the same guy;<ref name=\"lumbard\">{{cite web | url = http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/52716/rosario-vampire-capu2/ | title = Rosario + Vampire: CAPU2 (Season Two) | last = Lumbard | first = Neil | work = DVD Talk | date = January 7, 2012 | access-date = December 16, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141109092505/http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/52716/rosario-vampire-capu2/ | archive-date = November 9, 2014 | url-status = live }}</ref> however, H\u00f8gset noted that her anime role was reduced to obnoxious comedy acts.<ref name=\"them2\">{{cite web |last=H\u00f8gset |first=Stig |url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1105 |title=THEM Anime Reviews 4.0 - Rosario + Vampire capu2 |work=THEM Anime Reviews |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303165042/http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1105 |archive-date=2014-03-03 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<!-- supporting characters and antagonist design -->\nCarlo Santos, in reviewing the manga volumes, found the antagonist monster designs to interest him the most, and wished Ikeda would have focused the story on action-fantasy themed manga.<ref name=\"santos gn5\">{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/rosario+vampire/gn-5 | title=Rosario + Vampire GN 5 - Review | publisher=Anime News Network | date=2009-03-13 | accessdate=2013-12-18 | last=Santos | first=Carlo | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221034838/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/rosario+vampire/gn-5 | archive-date=2013-12-21 | url-status=live }}</ref> He called antagonist [[#Hokuto Kaneshiro|Hokuto Kaneshiro]] a \"dead ringer for [[Light Yagami]] from ''[[Death Note]]''\" and smarter than the usual monsters of the week, but the storyline he is placed in is predictable.<ref name=\"santos gn8\">{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/rosario+vampire/gn-8 | title=Rosario + Vampire GN 8 - Review | publisher=Anime News Network | date=2009-09-07 | accessdate=2013-12-18 | last=Santos | first=Carlo | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221020741/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/rosario+vampire/gn-8 | archive-date=2013-12-21 | url-status=live }}</ref> Although he liked that Hokuto had a \"shocking truth....that could have been a game-changer for the series\", he was disappointed in Ikeda's resolution to the story: \"Hokuto has an arbitrary, unconvincing change of heart, school life is reset to the way it was, and the villain walks off as if nothing happened.\" He found the canned phrases of the girls fighting in some of the comedy chapters to be entertaining, including [[#Kyoko Aono|Kyoko]]'s gold mine of one-liners.<ref name=\"santos gn9\">{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/rosario+vampire/gn-9 | title=Rosario + Vampire GN 9 - Review | publisher=Anime News Network | date=2009-11-04 | accessdate=2013-12-18 | last=Santos | first=Carlo | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221040416/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/rosario+vampire/gn-9 | archive-date=2013-12-21 | url-status=live }}</ref> H\u00f8gset found [[#Mysterious Bat|the bat]] to be really obnoxious with its spouting useless trivia, repeating what happens to Moka, and things that bring the story to a grinding halt<ref name=\"them\"/> or \"make you want to bludgeon your brain out of your cranium with something made of metal.\"<ref name=\"them2\"/> Serdar Yegulalp of About.com also agrees about the bat bringing the action to dead halt.

Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

Some trilobite taxa preserve their digestive tracts. An unnamed dalmanitid is commonly found with its dorsal exoskeleton intact and sometimes seen in such numbers that they cover large surfaces of sediment.<ref name=MikulicBriggs&Kluessendorf1985/><ref name= WendruffBK&M2020/>\n\nSome [[taxa]] do not readily fit within existing arthropod groups, such as the very common \u201cbutterfly animal,\u201d which appears to have two wing-like extensions at its sides, but may be another enigmatic bivalved arthropod.<ref name=MikulicBriggs&Kluessendorf1985/><ref name= WendruffBK&M2020/>\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=180px>\nParioscorpio lungs.png|Pulmonary-cardiovascular structures of ''[[Parioscorpio]]''\nCheloniellid.jpg|A [[cheloniellid]] [[arthropod]]\nDalmanitid trilobite.jpg|Dalmanitid [[trilobite]]; the most common trilobite of the Waukesha Biota\nMeroperyx.jpg|The styginid trilobite ''[[Meroperyx]]''\n</gallery>\n\n=== Anomalocarid? ===\nThe grasping appendage of what is questionably attributed to an [[anomalocarid]] was found among the Waukesha Biota material. <ref name=Wendruff2016>{{cite book |last=Wendruff |first=A.J. |title=Paleobiology and Taphonomy of Exceptionally Preserved Organisms from the Brandon Bridge Formation (Silurian), Wisconsin, USA|date=2016 |publisher=Ph.D dissertation, Ohio State University  |location= |pages=|url= https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:osu1468844814#abstract-files}}</ref> If this identification proves accurate, the specimen would be the first occurrence of an anomalocarid to be found in the Silurian.<ref name=Giribet&Edgecombe2019>{{cite journal | title=The phylogeny and evolutionary history of arthropods |journal=Current Biology |volume=29 |issue= 12|pages=592\u2013602 |year=2019 |last1=Giribet |first1=G. |last2=Edgecombe |first2=G.D. |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2019.04.057 |pmid=31211983 }}</ref>\n\n=== Lobopods ===\nSeveral unnamed species of [[lobopod]]s (worm-like animals with annulated appendages) are known from the Waukesha Biota.<ref name=MikulicBriggs&Kluessendorf1985/><ref name=Wendruff2016/> One of these was originally thought to be a [[myriopod]] arthropod until further study revealed key lobopod characteristics.<ref name=Wilsonetal2004/>\n\n=== \"Worms\" ===\nMany exquisitely preserved [[vermiform]] fossils, some preserving digestive tracts, are part of the Waukesha biota. These include [[annelid]]s, such as an aphroditid [[polychaete]], a spiny [[polychaete]], and an annelid that appears to have a sucker disc at one end.
