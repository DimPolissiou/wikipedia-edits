Formed in 1998, the band is composed of singer [[Julian Casablancas]],   guitarists [[Nick Valensi]] and [[Albert Hammond, Jr.|Albert Hammond Jr.]], bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]], and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]]. Following the conclusion of five-album deals with [[RCA Records|RCA]] and [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]], the band has continued to release new music through Casablancas' [[Cult Records]].\n\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Is This It]]'' (2001),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/thestrokes.html |title=The Strokes at |publisher=Infoplease.com |date= |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}</ref> was met with widespread critical acclaim and helped usher in the [[garage rock revival]] movement of the early 21st century; it was ranked No. 8 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s 100 \"Best Debut Albums of All Time\",<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-100-greatest-debut-albums-of-all-time-20130322 |title=The 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time |magazine=Rolling Stone |accessdate=June 17, 2013}}</ref> No. 2 on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s \"100 Best Albums of the '00s\",<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-2000s-20110718/the-strokes-is-this-it-20110715 |title=100 Best Albums of the 2000s: The Strokes, 'Is This It' |magazine=Rolling Stone |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}</ref> No. 199 on ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s \"[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]\", and No. 4 on ''[[NME]]''{{'s}} \"Top 500 Albums of All Time\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and ''The Modern Age'' EP (1998\u20132001)===\nLead singer-songwriter [[Julian Casablancas]], guitarist [[Nick Valensi]], and drummer [[Fabrizio Moretti]] started playing together while attending [[Dwight School]] in [[Manhattan]]. Bassist [[Nikolai Fraiture]] befriended Casablancas while the two attended the [[Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de New York]]. At age 13, Casablancas was sent to [[Institut Le Rosey|Le Rosey]], a boarding school in [[Switzerland]], to improve his academic performance. There, he met guitarist [[Albert Hammond, Jr.]] Later, when Hammond came to New York to attend [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts]], he shared an apartment with Casablancas. The roommates started a band, first performing at HiFi Bar, then The Spiral, followed by the [[Luna Lounge]] on the [[Lower East Side]] of New York, and then at Manhattan's popular [[Mercury Lounge]]. The Mercury Lounge's booker, [[Ryan Gentles]], quit his job to become the band's manager.<ref>Bush, B. (August 2002). The strokes. Music Connection, 26, 32\u201335.</ref>\n\nThe band began rehearsing a fourteen-song set (an early blueprint of the Strokes\u2019 2001 debut, ''Is This It'')\u2014including, \"Alone, Together,\" \"Barely Legal,\" \"[[Last Nite]],\" \"[[The Modern Age]],\" \"New York City Cops,\" \"Soma,\" \"[[Someday (The Strokes song)|Someday]],\" \"Take It or Leave It,\" and \"This Life\" (an early version of \"Trying Your Luck\"). Most of these songs now feature different [[lyrics]]. The band sent a demo to the newly reformed [[Rough Trade Records]] in the UK, sparking interest there, and leading to their first release (via the website of the UK magazine, ''[[NME]],'' who gave away a free mp3 download of \"[[Last Nite]]\" a week prior to the physical release as part of ''[[The Modern Age]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 2001). The EP sparked a bidding war among [[record label]]s, the largest for a rock band in years.<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtve.com/article.php?ArticleId=4690|title=the Strokes: \"We Just Do Our Own Thing\"|accessdate=January 23, 2007|year=2001|author=Joe D'Angelo|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211070125/http://www.mtve.com/article.php?ArticleId=4690|archivedate=February 11, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In August 2001, the Strokes made their first appearance on the cover of the publication ''[[The Fader]]'' in its ninth issue.<ref>{{cite magazine\n  | title = Fader 50: New York Rock\n  | magazine = The Fader\n  | date = November 26, 2007\n  | url = http://www.thefader.com/2007/11/26/fader-50-new-york-rock/\n  | accessdate=November 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===''Is This It''  (2001\u20132002) ===\n\nThe Strokes released their debut album, ''[[Is This It]],'' in the US in October 2001. The album was produced by Gordon Raphael, as was their follow-up album ''[[Room On Fire]]''. [[RCA]] delayed the North American (US) release over concerns with the album's cover and lyrics. The UK-released cover features a [[black-and-white]] photo of a gloved hand on a woman's naked backside, shown in semi-profile (photographer Colin Lane's then-girlfriend)<ref>The strokes: Never mind the buttocks ...

RCA replaced the track \"New York City Cops\" with \"When It Started\", as the former featured potentially inflammatory lyrics in the wake of the  [[September 11 attacks]]. The track \"New York City Cops\"\u2014featuring the refrain, \"New York City Cops, they ain't too smart\"\u2014was listed as No. 12 on ''New York'' magazine's \"Ultimate New York Playlist\" on March 1, 2010. Despite its delayed release (and the potential controversy), ''Is This It'' received critical acclaim\u2014among other accolades, four stars from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and a 9.1 from [[Pitchfork Media]]. The album made many critics' top-ten lists, was named the best album of the year by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and (in an article previewing summer concerts) ''[[NME]]'' urged readers to attend the Strokes\u2019 shows\u2014as they were touring some of the \"best pop songs ever\". While critics noted the influence of [[CBGB]] stalwarts [[Television (band)|Television]], Casablancas and bandmates said they had never heard the band, instead citing [[the Velvet Underground]] as a reference point.\n\nAfter the release of ''Is This It'', the band toured around the world\u2014including [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]] (the band opened for the [[Rolling Stones]] on numerous occasions during the North American leg of their tour). The self-made mini-documentary \"In Transit\" was filmed during the summer tour of Europe. In August 2002, the band headlined the UK's [[Carling Weekend]] festivals for the second time, subsequently playing at New York's [[Radio City Music Hall]] on a bill with [[the White Stripes]]. [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] joined the Strokes on stage to perform the guitar solo on \"New York City Cops\". During that period, the band also appeared as musical guests on numerous late-night talk shows. ''Is This It'' yielded several singles and music videos, all of which were directed by [[Roman Coppola]].\n\n[[File:Nick valensi 2dollarbill.jpg|thumb|left|Valensi at [[MTV]] 2 Dollar Bill 2002]]\n''Is This It'' has had an enduring impact on fans and critics alike.

They also made the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress [[Drew Barrymore]], which ended in January 2007. The first single taken from ''Room on Fire'' was the song \"[[12:51 (The Strokes song)|12:51]]\", which used distinct keyboard-like sounds produced by Valensi's guitar. The video was also directed by Roman Coppola, and was inspired by the futuristic look of the 1980s film ''[[Tron]]''. This consisted of a mainly black scene, with instances of glowing picton blue and riptide.\n\nIn November 2003, the Strokes played on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', performing \"[[Reptilia (song)|Reptilia]]\", \"What Ever Happened\", \"Under Control\" and \"I Can't Win\".<ref>DeRogatis, J.

While on tour, Spektor and the Strokes recorded the song \"[[Modern Girls & Old Fashion Men]]\", released as a B-side on the \"Reptilia\" single. Also during the tour, the band included [[the Clash]]'s \"Clampdown\" as a cover, which was released as the B-side for \"[[The End Has No End]]\".\n\nIn late 2004, the Strokes revealed plans to release a live album. The ''Live in London'' LP was planned for release in October 2004, but was abandoned, reportedly due to recording quality problems. The chosen gig was one held at the legendary [[Alexandra Palace]] in North London.\n\n=== ''First Impressions of Earth'' and hiatus (2005\u20132007) ===\n[[File:The Strokes in concert.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Strokes in concert, 2006]]\nIn late September 2005, \"[[Juicebox (song)|Juicebox]]\", the first single from the Strokes' then unreleased third album, was leaked online, forcing the single's release date to be advanced. The single was then released as an exclusive on online download services. \"Juicebox\" became the Strokes' second UK Top 10 hit, as well as their second US Modern Rock Top 10 success. During November and December 2005 the Strokes did a promotional tour for the still unreleased album, which involved doing one-off shows in major cities around the world. Their third album, ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'', was released on December 30, 2005, in Germany<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.laut.de/The-Strokes/Alben/First-Impressions-Of-Earth-11120 |title=\"First Impressions of Earth\" von The Strokes |last=Butscher |first=Vicky |website=[[Laut.de]] |language=German |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> and January 3, 2006, elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/first-impressions-of-earth-mw0000339306 |title=First Impressions of Earth - The Strokes |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> It received mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the US and number one in the UK, the latter being a first for the band. In Japan, it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was \"like a scientific breakthrough\". In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' playing \"Juicebox\" and \"[[You Only Live Once (The Strokes song)|You Only Live Once]]\". The album was somewhat a departure from the band's two previous albums. One reason for this was a switch of producers from Gordon Raphael to David Kahne.<ref>Marchese, D. (January 2006).

In February 2006, the Strokes won \"Best International Band\" at the NME Awards. In March, the band returned to the US with their longest tour yet. The second single off ''First Impressions of Earth'', \"Heart in a Cage\", was released in March 2006. During the summer of 2006, the Strokes played several festival dates in Europe, including the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark, the [[Oxegen Festival]] in Ireland, the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, the FIB ([[Festival Internacional de Benic\u00e0ssim]]), [[Fuji Rock Festival]] and headlined the [[Pentaport Rock Festival]] in South Korea. They then toured Australia and Mexico in late August and early September, followed by the second leg of the United States tour. While in the US, the Strokes opened for [[Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers]] for five shows during their Highway Companion tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2006/07/tom-petty-adds-sept-dates-strokes-frank-black/ |title=Tom Petty Adds Sept.

During this final tour Casablancas stated to fans that the band would be taking an extensive break after it finished. An e-mail was sent out soon afterwards by Strokes manager [[Ryan Gentles]], confirming that \"much needed break\". A new band website went online in May 2007 along with the release of an alternate video to their single \"You Only Live Once\" directed by [[Warren Fu]]. The video also featured a brief interlude with \"Ize of the World\", also from ''First Impressions of Earth''. The song \"You Talk Way Too Much\" was used in a commercial for the Ford Sync.

Despite its delayed release (and the potential controversy), ''Is This It'' received critical acclaim\u2014among other accolades, four stars from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and a 9.1 from [[Pitchfork Media]]. The album made many critics' top-ten lists, was named the best album of the year by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', and (in an article previewing summer concerts) ''[[NME]]'' urged readers to attend the Strokes\u2019 shows\u2014as they were touring some of the \"best pop songs ever\". While critics noted the influence of [[CBGB]] stalwarts [[Television (band)|Television]], Casablancas and bandmates said they had never heard the band, instead citing [[the Velvet Underground]] as a reference point.\n\nAfter the release of ''Is This It'', the band toured around the world\u2014including [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]] (the band opened for the [[Rolling Stones]] on numerous occasions during the North American leg of their tour). The self-made mini-documentary \"In Transit\" was filmed during the summer tour of Europe. In August 2002, the band headlined the UK's [[Carling Weekend]] festivals for the second time, subsequently playing at New York's [[Radio City Music Hall]] on a bill with [[the White Stripes]]. [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] joined the Strokes on stage to perform the guitar solo on \"New York City Cops\".

They also made the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress [[Drew Barrymore]], which ended in January 2007. The first single taken from ''Room on Fire'' was the song \"[[12:51 (The Strokes song)|12:51]]\", which used distinct keyboard-like sounds produced by Valensi's guitar. The video was also directed by Roman Coppola, and was inspired by the futuristic look of the 1980s film ''[[Tron]]''. This consisted of a mainly black scene, with instances of glowing picton blue and riptide.\n\nIn November 2003, the Strokes played on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', performing \"[[Reptilia (song)|Reptilia]]\", \"What Ever Happened\", \"Under Control\" and \"I Can't Win\".<ref>DeRogatis, J.

Also during the tour, the band included [[the Clash]]'s \"Clampdown\" as a cover, which was released as the B-side for \"[[The End Has No End]]\".\n\nIn late 2004, the Strokes revealed plans to release a live album. The ''Live in London'' LP was planned for release in October 2004, but was abandoned, reportedly due to recording quality problems. The chosen gig was one held at the legendary [[Alexandra Palace]] in North London.\n\n=== ''First Impressions of Earth'' and hiatus (2005\u20132007) ===\n[[File:The Strokes in concert.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The Strokes in concert, 2006]]\nIn late September 2005, \"[[Juicebox (song)|Juicebox]]\", the first single from the Strokes' then unreleased third album, was leaked online, forcing the single's release date to be advanced. The single was then released as an exclusive on online download services. \"Juicebox\" became the Strokes' second UK Top 10 hit, as well as their second US Modern Rock Top 10 success. During November and December 2005 the Strokes did a promotional tour for the still unreleased album, which involved doing one-off shows in major cities around the world. Their third album, ''[[First Impressions of Earth]]'', was released on December 30, 2005, in Germany<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.laut.de/The-Strokes/Alben/First-Impressions-Of-Earth-11120 |title=\"First Impressions of Earth\" von The Strokes |last=Butscher |first=Vicky |website=[[Laut.de]] |language=German |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> and January 3, 2006, elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/first-impressions-of-earth-mw0000339306 |title=First Impressions of Earth - The Strokes |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> It received mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the US and number one in the UK, the latter being a first for the band. In Japan, it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was \"like a scientific breakthrough\". In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' playing \"Juicebox\" and \"[[You Only Live Once (The Strokes song)|You Only Live Once]]\". The album was somewhat a departure from the band's two previous albums. One reason for this was a switch of producers from Gordon Raphael to David Kahne.<ref>Marchese, D. (January 2006).

The second single off ''First Impressions of Earth'', \"Heart in a Cage\", was released in March 2006. During the summer of 2006, the Strokes played several festival dates in Europe, including the Hultsfred Festival in Sweden, [[Roskilde Festival]] in Denmark, the [[Oxegen Festival]] in Ireland, the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in Switzerland, the FIB ([[Festival Internacional de Benic\u00e0ssim]]), [[Fuji Rock Festival]] and headlined the [[Pentaport Rock Festival]] in South Korea.

An e-mail was sent out soon afterwards by Strokes manager [[Ryan Gentles]], confirming that \"much needed break\". A new band website went online in May 2007 along with the release of an alternate video to their single \"You Only Live Once\" directed by [[Warren Fu]]. The video also featured a brief interlude with \"Ize of the World\", also from ''First Impressions of Earth''. The song \"You Talk Way Too Much\" was used in a commercial for the Ford Sync.

DNA transposons insert themselves into different genomic locations without copying themselves that can cause harmful [[mutations]] (see [[horizontal gene transfer]]). Hence retrotransposons can be thought of as replicative, whereas DNA transposons are non-replicative. Due to their replicative nature, retrotransposons can increase eukaryotic genome size quickly and survive in eukaryotic genomes permanently. It is thought that staying in eukaryotic genomes for such long periods gave rise to special [[Insertion_(genetics)|insertion]] methods that do not affect eukaryotic gene function drastically. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Finnegan DJ | title = Retrotransposons | journal = Cell Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 11 | pages = R432\u2013R437 | date = June 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.04.025 | pmid = 22677280 }}</ref>\n\n==LTR retrotransposons==\n{{Main article |LTR retrotransposon}}\n===Structure and function===\nLong strands of [[Direct repeat|repetitive DNA]] can be found at each end of a LTR retrotransposon. These are termed [[long terminal repeat|long terminal repeats]] (LTR) that are each a few hundred base pairs long, hence retrotransposons with LTRs have the name long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon.\nLTR retrotransposons are over 5 kilobases long. Between the long terminal repeats there are genes that can be transcribed equivalent to retrovirus genes [[Group specific antigen|gag]] and [[Pol_(HIV)|pol]]. These genes overlap so they encode a protease that processes the resulting transcript into functional gene products. Gag gene products associate with other retrotransposon transcripts to form virus-like particles. Pol gene products include enzymes reverse transcriptase, [[integrase]] and [[ribonuclease]] H domains. Reverse transcriptase carries out reverse transcription of retrotransposon DNA. Integrase \u2018integrates\u2019 retrotransposon DNA into eukaryotic genome DNA. Ribonuclease cleaves phosphodiester bonds between RNA nucleotides. \n\n===Synthesis and transposition===\nLTR retrotransposons encode transcripts with tRNA binding sites so that they can undergo reverse transcription. The tRNA-bound RNA transcript binds to a piece of genomic RNA. Template strand of retrotransposon DNA can hence be synthesised. Ribonuclease H domains degrade eukaryotic genomic RNA to give adenine- and guanine-rich DNA sequences that flag where the complementary noncoding strand has to be synthesised. Integrase then \u2018integrates\u2019 the retrotransposon into eukaryotic DNA using the hydroxyl group at the start of retrotransposon DNA. This results in a retrotransposon flagged by long terminal repeats at its ends. Because the retrotransposon contains eukaryotic genome information it can insert copies of itself into other genomic locations within a eukaryotic cell.\n\nLTR retrotransposons are sub-classified into the Ty1-''copia''-like ([[Pseudoviridae]]), Ty3-''gypsy''-like ([[Metaviridae]]), and BEL-Pao-like groups. Ty1-''copia'' and Ty3-''gypsy'' groups of retrotransposons are commonly found with up to a few million copies per [[haploid]] [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] in animals, fungi, protista, and plants genomes.

Instead they have short repeats thats can have an inverted order of bases next to each other aside from [[Direct repeat|direct repeats]] found in LTR retrotransposons that is just one sequence of bases repeating itself. \n\nAlthough they are retrotransposons, they cannot carry out reverse transcription using an RNA transposition intermediate in the same way as LTR retrotransposons. Those two key components of the retrotransposon are still necessary but the way they are incorporated into the chemical reactions is different. This is because unlike LTR retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons do not contain sequences that bind tRNA. \n\nThey mostly fall into two types - LINEs and SINEs. SVA elements are the exception between the two as they share similarities with both LINEs and SINEs, containing Alu elements and different numbers of the same repeat. SVAs are shorter than LINEs but longer than SINEs. \n\nWhile historically viewed as \"junk DNA\", research suggests in some cases, both LINEs and SINEs were incorporated into novel genes so as to evolve new functionality.<ref name=\"Santangelo\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santangelo AM, de Souza FS, Franchini LF, Bumaschny VF, Low MJ, Rubinstein M | title = Ancient exaptation of a CORE-SINE retroposon into a highly conserved mammalian neuronal enhancer of the proopiomelanocortin gene | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = 1813\u201326 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17922573 | pmc = 2000970 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030166 }}</ref>\n\n===LINEs===\n{{Main article | Long interspersed nuclear element}}\n\nWhen a LINE is transcribed, the transcript contains an RNA polymerase II promoter that ensures LINEs can be copied into whichever location it decides to insert itself into.

This transcript is the RNA transposition intermediate.  \n\nThe RNA transposition intermediate moves from the nucleus into the cytoplasm for translation. This gives the two coding regions of a LINE that in turn binds back to the RNA it is transcribed from. The LINE RNA then moves back into the nucleus to insert into the eukaryotic genome. \n\nLINEs insert themselves into regions of the eukaryotic genome that are rich in bases AT. At AT regions LINE uses its nuclease to cut one strand of the eukaryotic double-stranded DNA. The adenine-rich sequence in LINE transcript base pairs with the cut strand to flag where the LINE will be inserted with hydroxyl groups. Reverse transcriptase recognises these hydroxyl groups to synthesise LINE retrotransposon where the DNA is cut. Like with LTR retrotransposons, this new inserted LINE contains eukaryotic genome information so it can be copied and pasted into other genomic regions easily. The information sequences are longer and more variable than those in LTR retrotransposons. \n\nMost LINE copies have variable length at the start because reverse transcription usually stops before DNA synthesis is complete. In some cases this causes RNA polymerase II promoter to be lost so LINEs cannot transpose further.<ref name=Singer>{{cite journal | vauthors = Singer MF | title = SINEs and LINEs: highly repeated short and long interspersed sequences in mammalian genomes | journal = Cell | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 433\u20134 | date = March 1982 | pmid = 6280868 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(82)90194-5 }}</ref>\n\n====Human L1====\n{{Main article | LINE1}}\n\nAmong the LINE, there are several subgroups, such as L1, L2 and L3.

SINEs cannot transpose by themselves because they cannot encode SINE transcripts. They usually consist of parts derived from tRNA and LINEs. The tRNA portion contains an RNA polymerase III promoter which the same kind of enzyme as RNA polymerase II. This makes sure the LINE copies would be transcriped into RNA for further transposition. The LINE component remains so LINE-binding proteins can recognise the LINE part of the SINE.\n\n====Alu elements====\n{{Main article |Alu element}}\nThe most common SINE in primates is [[Alu element|''Alu'']]. Alu elements are approximately 350 base pairs long, do not contain any coding sequences, and can be recognized by the [[restriction enzyme]] [[List of restriction enzyme cutting sites: A#Whole list navigation|AluI]] (hence the name). The distribution of these elements has been implicated in some genetic diseases and cancers. Copy and pasting Alu RNA requires the Alu\u2019s adenine-rich end and the rest of the sequence bound to a signal. The signal-bound Alu region can then associate with ribosomes. LINE RNA associates on the same ribosomes as the Alu elements. Binding to the same ribosome allows Alu elements of SINEs to interact with LINE. This simultaneous translation of Alu element and LINE allows SINE copy and pasting.\n\n==SVA elements==\nSVA elements are present at lower levels than SINES and LINEs in humans. The starts of SVA and Alu elements are similar, followed by repeats and an end similar to endogenous retrovirus. LINEs bind to sites flanking SVA elements to transpose them. SVA are one of the youngest transposable element in great apes genome and among the most active and polymorphic in the human population.\n\nA recent study developed a network method that reveals SVA retroelement (RE) proliferation dynamics in\nhominid genomes <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy OR, Knisbacher BA, Levanon EY, Havlin SH | title = Integrating networks and comparative genomics reveals retroelement proliferation dynamics in hominid genomes | journal = Science Advances | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | date = 2017 | pages = e1701256 | pmid = 29043294| pmc = 5640379 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1701256 }}</ref>The method enable to track the course of SVA proliferation, identify yet unknown active communities, and detect tentative \u201cmaster REs\u201d that play key roles in SVA propagation. Thus, providing  support for the fundamental \u201cmaster gene\u201d model of RE proliferation.\n\n==Role in human disease==\nRetrotransposons ensure they are not lost by chance by occurring only in cell genetics that can be passed on from one generation to the next from parent gametes. However, LINEs can transpose into the human embryo cells that eventually develop into the nervous system, raising the question whether this LINE retrotransposition affects brain function. LINE retrotransposition is also a feature of several cancers, but it is unclear whether retrotransposition itself causes cancer instead of just a symptom.\nUncontrolled retrotransposition is bad for both the host organism and retrotransposons themselves so they have to be regulated. Retrotransposons are regulated by [[RNA interference]]. RNA interference is carried out by a bunch of short [[Non-coding_RNA|non-coding RNAs]]. The short non-coding RNA interacts with protein Argonaute to degrade retrotransposon transcripts and change their DNA histone structure to reduce their transcription.\n\n==Role in evolution==\nLTR retrotransposons came about later than non-LTR retrotransposons, possibly from an ancestral non-LTR retrotransposon acquiring an integrase from a DNA transposon. Retroviruses gained additional properties to their virus envelopes by taking the relevant genes from other viruses using the power of LTR retrotransposon.\n\nDue to their retrotransposition mechanism, retrotransposons amplify in number quickly, composing 40% of the human genome. The insertion rates for LINE1, Alu and SVA elements are 1/200 - 1/20, 1/20 and 1/900 respectively.

DNA transposons insert themselves into different genomic locations without copying themselves that can cause harmful [[mutations]] (see [[horizontal gene transfer]]). Hence retrotransposons can be thought of as replicative, whereas DNA transposons are non-replicative. Due to their replicative nature, retrotransposons can increase eukaryotic genome size quickly and survive in eukaryotic genomes permanently. It is thought that staying in eukaryotic genomes for such long periods gave rise to special [[Insertion_(genetics)|insertion]] methods that do not affect eukaryotic gene function drastically. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Finnegan DJ | title = Retrotransposons | journal = Cell Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 11 | pages = R432\u2013R437 | date = June 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.04.025 | pmid = 22677280 }}</ref>\n\n==LTR retrotransposons==\n{{Main article |LTR retrotransposon}}\n===Structure and function===\nLong strands of [[Direct repeat|repetitive DNA]] can be found at each end of a LTR retrotransposon. These are termed [[long terminal repeat|long terminal repeats]] (LTR) that are each a few hundred base pairs long, hence retrotransposons with LTRs have the name long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon.\nLTR retrotransposons are over 5 kilobases long. Between the long terminal repeats there are genes that can be transcribed equivalent to retrovirus genes [[Group specific antigen|gag]] and [[Pol_(HIV)|pol]]. These genes overlap so they encode a protease that processes the resulting transcript into functional gene products. Gag gene products associate with other retrotransposon transcripts to form virus-like particles. Pol gene products include enzymes reverse transcriptase, [[integrase]] and [[ribonuclease]] H domains. Reverse transcriptase carries out reverse transcription of retrotransposon DNA. Integrase \u2018integrates\u2019 retrotransposon DNA into eukaryotic genome DNA. Ribonuclease cleaves phosphodiester bonds between RNA nucleotides. \n\n===Synthesis and transposition===\nLTR retrotransposons encode transcripts with tRNA binding sites so that they can undergo reverse transcription. The tRNA-bound RNA transcript binds to a piece of genomic RNA. Template strand of retrotransposon DNA can hence be synthesised. Ribonuclease H domains degrade eukaryotic genomic RNA to give adenine- and guanine-rich DNA sequences that flag where the complementary noncoding strand has to be synthesised. Integrase then \u2018integrates\u2019 the retrotransposon into eukaryotic DNA using the hydroxyl group at the start of retrotransposon DNA. This results in a retrotransposon flagged by long terminal repeats at its ends. Because the retrotransposon contains eukaryotic genome information it can insert copies of itself into other genomic locations within a eukaryotic cell.\n\nLTR retrotransposons are sub-classified into the Ty1-''copia''-like ([[Pseudoviridae]]), Ty3-''gypsy''-like ([[Metaviridae]]), and BEL-Pao-like groups. Ty1-''copia'' and Ty3-''gypsy'' groups of retrotransposons are commonly found with up to a few million copies per [[haploid]] [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] in animals, fungi, protista, and plants genomes.

Instead they have short repeats thats can have an inverted order of bases next to each other aside from [[Direct repeat|direct repeats]] found in LTR retrotransposons that is just one sequence of bases repeating itself. \n\nAlthough they are retrotransposons, they cannot carry out reverse transcription using an RNA transposition intermediate in the same way as LTR retrotransposons. Those two key components of the retrotransposon are still necessary but the way they are incorporated into the chemical reactions is different. This is because unlike LTR retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons do not contain sequences that bind tRNA. \n\nThey mostly fall into two types - LINEs and SINEs. SVA elements are the exception between the two as they share similarities with both LINEs and SINEs, containing Alu elements and different numbers of the same repeat. SVAs are shorter than LINEs but longer than SINEs. \n\nWhile historically viewed as \"junk DNA\", research suggests in some cases, both LINEs and SINEs were incorporated into novel genes so as to evolve new functionality.<ref name=\"Santangelo\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santangelo AM, de Souza FS, Franchini LF, Bumaschny VF, Low MJ, Rubinstein M | title = Ancient exaptation of a CORE-SINE retroposon into a highly conserved mammalian neuronal enhancer of the proopiomelanocortin gene | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = 1813\u201326 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17922573 | pmc = 2000970 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030166 }}</ref>\n\n===LINEs===\n{{Main article | Long interspersed nuclear element}}\n\nWhen a LINE is transcribed, the transcript contains an RNA polymerase II promoter that ensures LINEs can be copied into whichever location it decides to insert itself into.

This transcript is the RNA transposition intermediate.  \n\nThe RNA transposition intermediate moves from the nucleus into the cytoplasm for translation. This gives the two coding regions of a LINE that in turn binds back to the RNA it is transcribed from. The LINE RNA then moves back into the nucleus to insert into the eukaryotic genome. \n\nLINEs insert themselves into regions of the eukaryotic genome that are rich in bases AT. At AT regions LINE uses its nuclease to cut one strand of the eukaryotic double-stranded DNA. The adenine-rich sequence in LINE transcript base pairs with the cut strand to flag where the LINE will be inserted with hydroxyl groups. Reverse transcriptase recognises these hydroxyl groups to synthesise LINE retrotransposon where the DNA is cut. Like with LTR retrotransposons, this new inserted LINE contains eukaryotic genome information so it can be copied and pasted into other genomic regions easily. The information sequences are longer and more variable than those in LTR retrotransposons. \n\nMost LINE copies have variable length at the start because reverse transcription usually stops before DNA synthesis is complete. In some cases this causes RNA polymerase II promoter to be lost so LINEs cannot transpose further.<ref name=Singer>{{cite journal | vauthors = Singer MF | title = SINEs and LINEs: highly repeated short and long interspersed sequences in mammalian genomes | journal = Cell | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 433\u20134 | date = March 1982 | pmid = 6280868 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(82)90194-5 }}</ref>\n\n====Human L1====\n{{Main article | LINE1}}\n\nAmong the LINE, there are several subgroups, such as L1, L2 and L3.

SINEs cannot transpose by themselves because they cannot encode SINE transcripts. They usually consist of parts derived from tRNA and LINEs. The tRNA portion contains an RNA polymerase III promoter which the same kind of enzyme as RNA polymerase II. This makes sure the LINE copies would be transcriped into RNA for further transposition. The LINE component remains so LINE-binding proteins can recognise the LINE part of the SINE.\n\n====Alu elements====\n{{Main article |Alu element}}\nThe most common SINE in primates is [[Alu element|''Alu'']]. Alu elements are approximately 350 base pairs long, do not contain any coding sequences, and can be recognized by the [[restriction enzyme]] [[List of restriction enzyme cutting sites: A#Whole list navigation|AluI]] (hence the name). The distribution of these elements has been implicated in some genetic diseases and cancers. Copy and pasting Alu RNA requires the Alu\u2019s adenine-rich end and the rest of the sequence bound to a signal. The signal-bound Alu region can then associate with ribosomes. LINE RNA associates on the same ribosomes as the Alu elements. Binding to the same ribosome allows Alu elements of SINEs to interact with LINE. This simultaneous translation of Alu element and LINE allows SINE copy and pasting.\n\n==SVA elements==\nSVA elements are present at lower levels than SINES and LINEs in humans. The starts of SVA and Alu elements are similar, followed by repeats and an end similar to endogenous retrovirus. LINEs bind to sites flanking SVA elements to transpose them. SVA are one of the youngest transposable element in great apes genome and among the most active and polymorphic in the human population.\n\nA recent study developed a network method that reveals SVA retroelement (RE) proliferation dynamics in\nhominid genomes <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy OR, Knisbacher BA, Levanon EY, Havlin SH | title = Integrating networks and comparative genomics reveals retroelement proliferation dynamics in hominid genomes | journal = Science Advances | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | date = 2017 | pages = e1701256 | pmid = 29043294| pmc = 5640379 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1701256 }}</ref>The method enable to track the course of SVA proliferation, identify yet unknown active communities, and detect tentative \u201cmaster REs\u201d that play key roles in SVA propagation. Thus, providing  support for the fundamental \u201cmaster gene\u201d model of RE proliferation.\n\n==Role in human disease==\nRetrotransposons ensure they are not lost by chance by occuring only in cell genetics that can be passed on from one generation to the next from parent gametes. However, LINEs can transpose into the human embryo cells that eventually develop into the nervous system, raising the question whether this LINE retrotransposition affects brain function. LINE retrotransposition is also a feature of several cancers, but it is unclear whether retrotransposition itself causes cancer instead of just a symptom.\nUncontrolled retrotransposition is bad for both the host organism and retrotransposons themselves so they have to be regulated. Retrotransposons are regulated by [[RNA interference]]. RNA interference is carried out by a bunch of short [[Non-coding_RNA|non-coding RNAs]]. The short non-coding RNA interacts with protein Argonaute to degrade retrotransposon transcripts and change their DNA histone structure to reduce their transcription.\n\n==Role in evolution==\nLTR retrotransposons came about later than non-LTR retrotransposons, possibly from an ancestral non-LTR retrotransposon acquiring an integrase from a DNA transposon. Retroviruses gained additional properties to their virus envelopes by taking the relevant genes from other viruses using the power of LTR retrotransposon.\n\nDue to their retrotransposition mechanism, retrotransposons amplify in number quickly, composing 40% of the human genome. The insertion rates for LINE1, Alu and SVA elements are 1/200 - 1/20, 1/20 and 1/900 respectively. The LINE1 insertion rates have varied a lot over the past 35 million years, so they indicate points in genome evolution. \n\nNotably a large number of 100 kilobases in the maize genome show variety due to the presence or absence of retrotransposons. However since maize is unusually genetically compared to other plants it cannot be used to predict retrotransposition in other plants.\n\nMutations caused by retrotransposons include:\n* Gene inactivation\n* Changing gene regulation\n* Changing gene products\n* Acting as DNA repair sites\n==Role in biotechnology==\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Transposon]]\n* [[Paleogenetics]]\n* [[Paleovirology]]\n* [[Insertion sequences]]\n* [[Copy-number variation]]\n* [[Genomic organization]]\n* [[Interspersed repeat]]\n* [[Retrotransposon marker]]s, a powerful method of reconstructing phylogenies.\n* [[RetrOryza]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Repeated sequence}}\n\n[[Category:Mobile genetic elements]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n", "name_user": "Orenburg1", "label": "safe", "comment": "sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrotransposon"}
