It is about a South Korean woman who accidentally [[Emergency landing|crash-lands]] in [[North Korea]]. It aired on [[TVN (South Korean TV channel)|tvN]] in South Korea and on [[Netflix]] worldwide from December 14, 2019, to February 16, 2020. It is the highest rated tvN drama and the [[Korean drama#List of highest-rated Korean dramas in cable television|second-highest-rated Korean drama in cable television history]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Crash Landing on You'' tells the story of two [[star crossed lovers]], Yoon Se-ri ([[Son Ye-jin]]), a [[South Korea|South Korean]] [[Chaebol]] heiress, and Ri Jeong-hyuk ([[Hyun Bin]]), a member of the [[North Korea]]n elite (who also happens to be an army officer). One day while Yoon Se-ri goes for a short [[paragliding]] ride in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], a sudden tornado knocks her out and blows her off course. She awakens to find herself up a tree in a forest in the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] in [[North Korea]] (a forbidden area for South Koreans). There she meets Ri Jeong-hyuk, a North Korean army officer, literally falling into his arms from the tree.  Ri Jeong-hyuk eventually gives Yoon Se-ri shelter, and develops plans to secretly help her return to South Korea. Over time, they fall in love, despite the [[North Korea\u2013South Korea relations|divide and dispute between their respective countries]].\n\nOne might have expected Se-ri\u2019s disappearance to be national news in South Korea. However, Se-ri\u2019s family suppresses the news for fear it will depress the stock price of the family-controlled chaebol. In particular, Se-ri\u2019s two brothers, Se-jung and Se-hyung, are rivals to succeed their father, who just before Se-ri\u2019s disappearance had announced he planned to anoint her because his sons are incompetent. They are supported by their equally ambitious wives, Do Hye-Ji ([[Hwang Woo-seul-hye]]) and Ko Sang-a ([[Yoon Ji-min]]).  In fact, Se-hyung finds out Se-ri is in the north and tries to keep her there and then to have her killed.\n\nSe-ri\u2019s and Jeong-hyuk\u2019s story is intertwined with that of Seo Dan ([[Seo Ji-hye]]) and Gu Seung-jun ([[Kim_Jung-hyun_(actor,_born_1990)|Kim Jung-hyun]]). Dan is the beautiful daughter of a wealthy North Korean department store owner. She has been studying cello in Russia for several years but returns so that she can marry Jeong-hyuk, to whom she is engaged through an arranged marriage and whom she has only met a few times. As she returns to Pyongyang, she crosses paths, not for the first time, with Gu Seung-jun. Gu Seung-jun, who had previously been engaged to Se-ri, has come to North Korea under the protection of corrupt North Korean officers to escape from the pursuit of Se-ri\u2019s brother Se-hyung, under whose incompetent watch he had embezzled large amounts of money. Although their initial encounters are not promising, they too eventually fall in love.\n\nThe story follows Jeong-Hyuk and Se-ri as they try to get her home. They are impeded by Cho Cheol-gang ([[Oh Man-seok]]), an evil and venal State Security officer, who a number of years ago had arranged for the murder of Jeong-hyuk\u2019s older brother, an officer who tried to expose him. The story eventually shifts to Seoul where both comedy and drama ensue for all four main characters, Se-ri\u2019s family, and the arch-villain Cho Cheol-gang.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Hyun Bin]] as Ri Jeong-hyeok<ref name=\"record\"/>\n: A skilled and dedicated captain in the [[Korean People's Army]] who is from a powerful family (his father is the director of the [[General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army|General Political Bureau]]).

It is about a South Korean woman who accidentally [[Emergency landing|crash-lands]] in [[North Korea]]. It aired on [[TVN (South Korean TV channel)|tvN]] in South Korea and on [[Netflix]] worldwide from December 14, 2019, to February 16, 2020. It is the highest rated tvN drama and the [[Korean drama#List of highest-rated Korean dramas in cable television|second-highest-rated Korean drama in cable television history]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Crash Landing on You'' tells the story of two [[star crossed lovers]], Yoon Se-ri ([[Son Ye-jin]]), a [[South Korea|South Korean]] [[Chaebol]] heiress, and Ri Jeong-hyuk ([[Hyun Bin]]), a member of the [[North Korea]]n elite (who also happens to be an army officer). One day while Yoon Se-ri goes for a short [[paragliding]] ride in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], a sudden tornado knocks her out and blows her off course. She awakens to find herself up a tree in a forest in the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] in [[North Korea]] (a forbidden area for South Koreans). There she meets Ri Jeong-hyuk, a North Korean army officer, literally falling into his arms from the tree.  Ri Jeong-hyuk eventually gives Yoon Se-ri shelter, and develops plans to secretly help her return to South Korea. Over time, they fall in love, despite the [[North Korea\u2013South Korea relations|divide and dispute between their respective countries]].\n\nOne might have expected Se-ri\u2019s disappearance to be national news in South Korea. However, Se-ri\u2019s family suppresses the news for fear it will depress the stock price of the family-controlled chaebol. In particular, Se-ri\u2019s two brothers, Se-jung and Se-hyung, are rivals to succeed their father, who just before Se-ri\u2019s disappearance had announced he planned to anoint her because his sons are incompetent. They are supported by their equally ambitious wives, Do Hye-Ji ([[Hwang Woo-seul-hye]]) and Ko Sang-a ([[Yoon Ji-min]]).  In fact, Se-hyung finds out Se-ri is in the north and tries to keep her there and then to have her killed.\n\nSe-ri\u2019s and Jeong-hyuk\u2019s story is intertwined with that of Seo Dan ([[Seo Ji-hye]]) and Gu Seung-jun ([[Kim_Jung-hyun_(actor,_born_1990)|Kim Jung-hyun]]). Dan is the beautiful daughter of a wealthy North Korean department store owner. She has been studying cello in Russia for several years but returns so that she can marry Jeong-hyuk, to whom she is engaged through an arranged marriage and whom she has only met a few times. As she returns to Pyongyang, she crosses paths, not for the first time, with Gu Seung-jun. Gu Seung-jun, who had previously been engaged to Se-ri, has come to North Korea under the protection of corrupt North Korean officers to escape from the pursuit of Se-ri\u2019s brother Se-hyung, under whose incompetent watch he had embezzled large amounts of money. Although their initial encounters are not promising, they too eventually fall in love.\n\nThe story follows Jeong-Hyuk and Se-ri as they try to get her home. They are impeded by Cho Cheol-gang ([[Oh Man-seok]]), an evil and venal State Security officer, who a number of years ago had arranged for the murder of Jeong-hyuk\u2019s older brother, an officer who tried to expose him. The story eventually shifts to Seoul where both comedy and drama ensue for all four main characters, Se-ri\u2019s family, and the arch-villain Cho Cheol-gang.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Hyun Bin]] as Ri Jeong-hyeok<ref name=\"record\"/>\n: A skilled and dedicated captain in the [[Korean People's Army]] who is from a powerful family (his father is the director of the [[General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army|General Political Bureau]]).

La Trobe sailed into Sydney on 26 July 1839, with his wife and 2-year-old daughter, for training on procedures. The La Trobes went on to Melbourne on 1 October.\n\nLa Trobe bought 12\u00bd acres of land on the fringe of the city, now called [[East Melbourne, Victoria|Jolimont]], at auction at the upset price of \u00a320 an acre; the residents of Melbourne having agreed among themselves not to bid against the superintendent. [[Governor of New South Wales]] [[George Gipps]] was disturbed when he heard about it. La Trobe, however, convinced him that he had acted innocently. On the land he erected his home, which has been preserved and is called [[LaTrobe's Cottage]], which he had transported in sections from London.\n\nMelbourne had a population of around 3,000 at the time and was rapidly expanding{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=August 2017}}. La Trobe commenced works to improve sanitation and streets.<ref name=\"DAB\"/> As Port Phillip District was a dependency of New South Wales at the time, all land sales, building plans and officer appointments had to be approved by Gipps, with whom La Trobe had a good personal and working relationship. \n[[File:Agnes Louisa de La Trobe, Madame Pierre de Salis (d.1916) in 1875 (modified_version).jpg|thumbnail|300px|A carte de visite photo of Charles Latrobe's daughter, Agnes Louisa, Madame [[John Francis William, 6th Count de Salis-Soglio#His brother Count Peter|Pierre de Salis]] (1837-1916) in 1875.]]\nA Separation Association had been formed in 1840 wanting Port Phillip District to become a separate colony. In 1841 La Trobe wrote to Gipps, asking him to visit Melbourne to form his own opinion on the separation question.<ref name=\"DAB\"/> La Trobe did not actively campaign for separation, content that [[Earl Grey]] had included separation in the reorganisation plan for the colonies.<ref name=\"ADB\"/> La Trobe acted as lieutenant-governor of [[Van Diemen's Land]] for four months in 1846-47. By 1851, Port Phillip district had gained separation from New South Wales, becoming the colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and La Trobe was lieutenant-governor for three years \u2013 a position he held until 1854.\n\nSoon after separation, gold was discovered at several locations in Victoria and La Trobe had to deal with the mass exodus of the population of Melbourne to the gold fields.\n\nHe was commonly referred to as \"Charley Joe\", and by extension, any government officials or policemen were called \"joes\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5UkgUWydJmIC&pg=PA222 Edward Ellis Morris, ''Austral English: A Dictionary of Australasian Words, Phrases and Usages'']</ref> La Trobe, who had suffered self-doubt and criticisms due to his inexperience, submitted his resignation in December 1852 but had to wait until a replacement, [[Charles Hotham]], could take his place.\n\n==After Victoria==\nTowards the end of his governorship, La Trobe's wife Sophie became ill and returned to Europe with their four children. Sophie died on 30 January 1854. On his return to Europe after his term, La Trobe in 1855 married Sophie's sister, Rose Isabelle de Meuron (1821\u20131883), a marriage which was illegal in English law as incestuous at the time. (See [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907]].)

In 1847, at Limeburners' Point near [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Charles La Trobe, a keen amateur geologist, was examining the shells from a lime kiln when a worker showed him a set of five keys that he claimed to have found, subsequently named the [[Geelong Keys]]. La Trobe concluded that, based on their appearance, the keys were dropped onto the beach around 100 to 150 years beforehand (i.e., between 1700 and 1750). In 1977, [[Kenneth McIntyre]] hypothesized they were dropped by Portuguese sailors under the command of [[Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o de Mendon\u00e7a]].<ref>McIntyre, K (1977) ''The Secret Discovery of Australia, Portuguese ventures 200 years before Cook'', p.249-262 Souvenir Press, Menindie {{ISBN|0-285-62303-6}}</ref> Since the keys have long been lost, their exact origin cannot be verified. However, research by Geologists [[Edmund Dwen Gill|Edmund Gill]] and P.F.B. Alsop showed the deposit they were found in was 2330\u20132800 years old, making La Trobe's dating impossible.<ref>Gill, E (1987) \"On the McKiggan Theory of the Geelong keys\" in ''The Mahogany ship.

Their first child, Agnes Louisa de La Trobe, was born on 2 April 1837 in Switzerland.\n\n==Lieutenant-governor==\nIn 1837 La Trobe was entrusted with a government commission in the [[West Indies]] and reported on the future education of the recently emancipated slaves.\n\nOn 4 February 1839<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://researchdata.ands.org.au/superintendent-of-the-port-phillip-district/166329|title=Superintendent of the Port Phillip District|access-date=2016-10-04}}</ref> he was appointed superintendent of the [[Port Phillip District]] of [[New South Wales]] though he had little managerial and administrative experience. La Trobe sailed into Sydney on 26 July 1839, with his wife and 2-year-old daughter, for training on procedures. The La Trobes went on to Melbourne on 1 October.\n\nLa Trobe bought 12\u00bd acres of land on the fringe of the city, now called [[East Melbourne, Victoria|Jolimont]], at auction at the upset price of \u00a320 an acre; the residents of Melbourne having agreed among themselves not to bid against the superintendent. [[Governor of New South Wales]] [[George Gipps]] was disturbed when he heard about it. La Trobe, however, convinced him that he had acted innocently. On the land he erected his home, which has been preserved and is called [[LaTrobe's Cottage]], which he had transported in sections from London.\n\nMelbourne had a population of around 3,000 at the time and was rapidly expanding{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=August 2017}}. La Trobe commenced works to improve sanitation and streets.<ref name=\"DAB\"/> As Port Phillip District was a dependency of New South Wales at the time, all land sales, building plans and officer appointments had to be approved by Gipps, with whom La Trobe had a good personal and working relationship. \n[[File:Agnes Louisa de La Trobe, Madame Pierre de Salis (d.1916) in 1875 (modified_version).jpg|thumbnail|300px|A carte de visite photo of Charles Latrobe's daughter, Agnes Louisa, Madame [[John Francis William, 6th Count de Salis-Soglio#His brother Count Peter|Pierre de Salis]] (1837-1916) in 1875.]]\nA Separation Association had been formed in 1840 wanting Port Phillip District to become a separate colony. In 1841 La Trobe wrote to Gipps, asking him to visit Melbourne to form his own opinion on the separation question.<ref name=\"DAB\"/> La Trobe did not actively campaign for separation, content that [[Earl Grey]] had included separation in the reorganisation plan for the colonies.<ref name=\"ADB\"/> La Trobe acted as lieutenant-governor of [[Van Diemen's Land]] for four months in 1846-47. By 1851, Port Phillip district had gained separation from New South Wales, becoming the colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and La Trobe was lieutenant-governor for three years \u2013 a position he held until 1854.\n\nSoon after separation, gold was discovered at several locations in Victoria and La Trobe had to deal with the mass exodus of the population of Melbourne to the gold fields.\n\nHe was commonly referred to as \"Charley Joe\", and by extension, any government officials or policemen were called \"joes\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5UkgUWydJmIC&pg=PA222 Edward Ellis Morris, ''Austral English: A Dictionary of Australasian Words, Phrases and Usages'']</ref> La Trobe, who had suffered self-doubt and criticisms due to his inexperience, submitted his resignation in December 1852 but had to wait until a replacement, [[Charles Hotham]], could take his place.\n\n==After Victoria==\nTowards the end of his governorship, La Trobe's wife Sophie became ill and returned to Europe with their four children. Sophie died on 30 January 1854. On his return to Europe after his term, La Trobe in 1855 married Sophie's sister, Rose Isabelle de Meuron (1821\u20131883), a marriage which was illegal in English law as incestuous at the time. (See [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907]].) The couple had two daughters (born 1856 and 1859) in Switzerland and moved to England in 1861.<ref>[http://latrobefamily.com/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I1404&tree=mytree Mytree]</ref> He did not receive any further British government appointments. His eyesight was increasingly deteriorating, and he was completely blind for the last years of his life.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He died in 1875.\n\n==Geelong keys==\nLa Trobe is also linked to the discovery of a minor piece of evidence suggesting early [[Theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia|European exploration of Australia]]. In 1847, at Limeburners' Point near [[Geelong]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Charles La Trobe, a keen amateur geologist, was examining the shells from a lime kiln when a worker showed him a set of five keys that he claimed to have found, subsequently named the [[Geelong Keys]]. La Trobe concluded that, based on their appearance, the keys were dropped onto the beach around 100 to 150 years beforehand (i.e., between 1700 and 1750). In 1977, [[Kenneth McIntyre]] hypothesized they were dropped by Portuguese sailors under the command of [[Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o de Mendon\u00e7a]].<ref>McIntyre, K (1977) ''The Secret Discovery of Australia, Portuguese ventures 200 years before Cook'', p.249-262 Souvenir Press, Menindie {{ISBN|0-285-62303-6}}</ref> Since the keys have long been lost, their exact origin cannot be verified. However, research by Geologists [[Edmund Dwen Gill|Edmund Gill]] and P.F.B. Alsop showed the deposit they were found in was 2330\u20132800 years old, making La Trobe's dating impossible.<ref>Gill, E (1987) \"On the McKiggan Theory of the Geelong keys\" in ''The Mahogany ship.

Coyote was also an actor, writer and director with the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]]; his prominence in the San Francisco [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] scene led to his being interviewed for the book ''Voices from the Love Generation''.

He served on the CAC from 1975 to 1983. After his first year, Coyote was elected chairman by his peers three years in a row. During his tenure as chairman, the Council's overhead expenses dropped from 50% to 15%, the lowest in the State, and the Arts Council budget rose from $1 million to $16 million. His council introduced the idea of artists as \"creative problem solvers.\" By paying artists to \"solve problems for the state\" rather than to make art, they bypassed the objections of many conservative lawmakers. Coyote engineered relationships with 14 departments of the State of California, which began to use artists in a variety of capacities, paying 50 cents on the dollar for it. The policy and the council were an immense success, giving Coyote the confidence (after 12 years in the counterculture) to try his hand at mainstream film-acting.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Film and television acting==\nIn 1978, Coyote began acting again (\"to shake the rust out\") appearing in plays at San Francisco's award-winning [[Magic Theatre]]. While playing the lead in the world premiere of [[Sam Shepard]]'s ''[[True West (play)|True West]]'', a Hollywood agent approached him, and his film career began with ''[[Die Laughing (film)|Die Laughing]]'' (1980). He gave supporting performances in ''[[Tell Me a Riddle (film)|Tell Me a Riddle]]'' (1980), ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]'' (1981) and as the mysterious scientist \"Keys\" in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982). He was seriously considered for the role of [[Indiana Jones]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and auditioned for the part. Coyote's first starring role was in the science fiction adventure ''[[Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann]]'' (1982). He also starred in ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]'' (1985) and ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' (1987). Since then, he has made more than 120 films for theaters and television and has played starring roles for many directors, including [[Roman Polanski]] (''[[Bitter Moon]]''), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] (''[[Kika (1993 film)|Kika]]''), [[Martin Ritt]] (''[[Cross Creek (film)|Cross Creek]]''), [[Jean-Paul Rappeneau]] (''[[Bon Voyage (2003 film)|Bon Voyage]]''), [[Diane Kurys]] (''[[A Man in Love (1987 film)|A Man in Love]]'') and [[Walter Salles]] (''[[A Grande Arte|Exposure]]''). For his 1990 guest appearance on the television series ''[[Road to Avonlea]]'', he received his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\n[[Leonard Maltin]] once wrote, \"Coyote's no rubber-stamp leading man\", but he seems comfortable with that. \"I'm a [[Zen]] Buddhist student first, actor second\", Coyote has said. \"If I can't reconcile the two lives, I'll stop acting. I spend more time off-screen than on.\" In addition to his movie work in more recent films such as ''[[Sphere (1998 film)|Sphere]]'', ''[[A Walk to Remember]]'', and ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'', Coyote has also appeared in many made-for-TV movies and miniseries, and he does commercial voice-overs. Coyote was cast in lead roles on several television series: ''[[The 4400]]'' in 2004 and ''[[The Inside (TV series)|The Inside]]'' in 2005. After ''The Inside'' was canceled, Coyote returned to ''The 4400'' as a special guest star for their two-part season finale, then joined the cast of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s series ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'' as the [[Vice President of the United States]], and the next year did a four episode turn as [[Sally Field]]'s disreputable boyfriend in ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]''.\n\n==Narration==\nIn 2005, Coyote served as the narrator for several prominent projects including the documentary film ''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'' and the ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''-produced [[PBS]] documentary based on [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''. He also narrated an episode of the series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' in April 2006. In 2008, he narrated ''[[Torturing Democracy]]'', a documentary produced by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] which details the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W.

He also narrated the 12-hour [[Ken Burns]] series on the [[The National Parks: America's Best Idea|National Parks]], and 15 episodes for the ''[[National Geographic Explorer]]'' series. In 2010 he narrated the documentary ''Solitary Confinement'' on the effect of long-term isolation, with footage taken from [[Colorado State Penitentiary]] where all prisoners are held this way. In 2014, he appeared in the [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] television series ''[[Perception (American TV series)|Perception]]'', as the father of the main character, Dr. Daniel Pierce, and narrated Burns' [[The Roosevelts (miniseries)|''The Roosevelts: An Intimate History'']]; the latter saw him win his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]]. In 2019, he narrated Burns' PBS documentary ''[[Country Music (miniseries)]]''.<ref>https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nCoyote's [[left-wing politics]] are evident in his articles for ''[[Mother Jones magazine|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, some of which he wrote as a delegate to the [[1996 Democratic National Convention]]; in his disagreements with [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]]; and in his autobiography ''Sleeping Where I Fall''. In 2006, he developed a political television show for [[Link TV]] called \"The Active Opposition\" and in 2007 created ''Outside the Box with Peter Coyote'' starting on Link TV's special, Special: ''The End of Oil \u2013 Part 2''.\n\nMany of Coyote's stories from the 1967 to 1975 [[counter-culture]] period are included in his memoir, ''Sleeping Where I Fall,'' published by [[Counterpoint Press]] in April 1998. One of the stories incorporated into his book is \"Carla's Story,\" about a 16-year-old mother who lived communally with Coyote, and who, after learning of her husband's murder, became a drug addict, then a prostitute, had her children stolen, and continued to spiral downhill until she turned her life around. This story was published in ''[[Zyzzyva (magazine)|Zyzzyva]]'', and awarded the 1993\u20131994 [[Pushcart Prize]]. He also states he was a close friend of singer [[Janis Joplin]].

This caused him to change his name to Coyote, after meeting [[Rolling Thunder (person)|Rolling Thunder]] (John Pope), a self-styled [[Shamanism|shaman]], who believed the experience was spiritually significant.<ref>\"Krassner reviews 'Sleeping Where I Fall' by Peter Coyote\" (Sep/Oct 1999) ''[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]]'' Vol.14 No.5 pp. 71-74</ref>\n\n==Countercultural activities==\nAfter a short apprenticeship at the San Francisco [[Actor's Workshop]], he joined the [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]], a radical political street theater whose members were arrested for performing in parks without permits.

He served on the CAC from 1975 to 1983. After his first year, Coyote was elected chairman by his peers three years in a row. During his tenure as chairman, the Council's overhead expenses dropped from 50% to 15%, the lowest in the State, and the Arts Council budget rose from $1 million to $16 million. His council introduced the idea of artists as \"creative problem solvers.\" By paying artists to \"solve problems for the state\" rather than to make art, they bypassed the objections of many conservative lawmakers. Coyote engineered relationships with 14 departments of the State of California, which began to use artists in a variety of capacities, paying 50 cents on the dollar for it. The policy and the council were an immense success, giving Coyote the confidence (after 12 years in the counterculture) to try his hand at mainstream film-acting.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n==Film and television acting==\nIn 1978, Coyote began acting again (\"to shake the rust out\") appearing in plays at San Francisco's award-winning [[Magic Theatre]]. While playing the lead in the world premiere of [[Sam Shepard]]'s ''[[True West (play)|True West]]'', a Hollywood agent approached him, and his film career began with ''[[Die Laughing (film)|Die Laughing]]'' (1980). He gave supporting performances in ''[[Tell Me a Riddle (film)|Tell Me a Riddle]]'' (1980), ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]'' (1981) and as the mysterious scientist \"Keys\" in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982). He was seriously considered for the role of [[Indiana Jones]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and auditioned for the part. Coyote's first starring role was in the science fiction adventure ''[[Timerider: The Adventure of Lyle Swann]]'' (1982). He also starred in ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]'' (1985) and ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'' (1987). Since then, he has made more than 120 films for theaters and television and has played starring roles for many directors, including [[Roman Polanski]] (''[[Bitter Moon]]''), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] (''[[Kika (1993 film)|Kika]]''), [[Martin Ritt]] (''[[Cross Creek (film)|Cross Creek]]''), [[Jean-Paul Rappeneau]] (''[[Bon Voyage (2003 film)|Bon Voyage]]''), [[Diane Kurys]] (''[[A Man in Love (1987 film)|A Man in Love]]'') and [[Walter Salles]] (''[[A Grande Arte|Exposure]]''). For his 1990 guest appearance on the television series ''[[Road to Avonlea]]'', he received his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\n[[Leonard Maltin]] once wrote, \"Coyote's no rubber-stamp leading man\", but he seems comfortable with that. \"I'm a [[Zen]] Buddhist student first, actor second\", Coyote has said. \"If I can't reconcile the two lives, I'll stop acting. I spend more time off-screen than on.\" In addition to his movie work in more recent films such as ''[[Sphere (1998 film)|Sphere]]'', ''[[A Walk to Remember]]'', and ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'', Coyote has also appeared in many made-for-TV movies and miniseries, and he does commercial voice-overs. Coyote was cast in lead roles on several television series: ''[[The 4400]]'' in 2004 and ''[[The Inside (TV series)|The Inside]]'' in 2005. After ''The Inside'' was canceled, Coyote returned to ''The 4400'' as a special guest star for their two-part season finale, then joined the cast of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s series ''[[Commander in Chief (TV series)|Commander in Chief]]'' as the [[Vice President of the United States]], and the next year did a four episode turn as [[Sally Field]]'s disreputable boyfriend in ''[[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers & Sisters]]''.\n\n==Narration==\nIn 2005, Coyote served as the narrator for several prominent projects including the documentary film ''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'' and the ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''-produced [[PBS]] documentary based on [[Jared Diamond]]'s ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''. He also narrated an episode of the series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' in April 2006. In 2008, he narrated ''[[Torturing Democracy]]'', a documentary produced by [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] which details the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]'s use of \"[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]\" in the [[War on Terror]]. He also narrated the 12-hour [[Ken Burns]] series on the [[The National Parks: America's Best Idea|National Parks]], and 15 episodes for the ''[[National Geographic Explorer]]'' series. In 2010 he narrated the documentary ''Solitary Confinement'' on the effect of long-term isolation, with footage taken from [[Colorado State Penitentiary]] where all prisoners are held this way. In 2014, he appeared in the [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] television series ''[[Perception (American TV series)|Perception]]'', as the father of the main character, Dr. Daniel Pierce, and narrated Burns' [[The Roosevelts (miniseries)|''The Roosevelts: An Intimate History'']]; the latter saw him win his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]]. In 2019, he narrated Burns' PBS documentary ''[[Country Music (miniseries)]]''.<ref>https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nCoyote's [[left-wing politics]] are evident in his articles for ''[[Mother Jones magazine|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, some of which he wrote as a delegate to the [[1996 Democratic National Convention]]; in his disagreements with [[David Horowitz (conservative writer)|David Horowitz]]; and in his autobiography ''Sleeping Where I Fall''. In 2006, he developed a political television show for [[Link TV]] called \"The Active Opposition\" and in 2007 created ''Outside the Box with Peter Coyote'' starting on Link TV's special, Special: ''The End of Oil \u2013 Part 2''.\n\nMany of Coyote's stories from the 1967 to 1975 [[counter-culture]] period are included in his memoir, ''Sleeping Where I Fall,'' published by [[Counterpoint Press]] in April 1998. One of the stories incorporated into his book is \"Carla's Story,\" about a 16-year-old mother who lived communally with Coyote, and who, after learning of her husband's murder, became a drug addict, then a prostitute, had her children stolen, and continued to spiral downhill until she turned her life around. This story was published in ''[[Zyzzyva (magazine)|Zyzzyva]]'', and awarded the 1993\u20131994 [[Pushcart Prize]]. He also states he was a close friend of singer [[Janis Joplin]].

L. Rev. 417, 425 (2017)</ref> while a group of prominent [[legal historian]]s more narrowly concluded that \"no modern-style nationwide injunctions issued\" at common law.<ref>Brief of Amici Curiae Legal Historians in Support of Plaintiff and Appellee the City of Chicago at 6, City of Chicago v. Whitaker, No. 18-2885 (7th Cir. Nov. 15, 2018)</ref> Courts did have the [[equitable power]] to enjoin defendants with regard to the plaintiff, but typically not the world at large.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 420 (2017)</ref> In cases where multiple parties had a common claim against the same defendant, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|British Chancellor]] sometimes offered a remedy known as a \u201c[[Bill of Peace|bill of peace]].\u201d<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 426 (2017)</ref> The bill of peace bound the defendant against that group of parties with a common claim, regardless of whether they were all parties in the case.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 426 (2017)</ref> For example, if several tenants brought a claim against a landlord that they shared in common with all tenants, then the court of equity might issue a remedy that applied to the landlord's relations with those tenants not before the court.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 426 (2017)</ref> This order only applied to the defendant's interactions with an identified group of similarly situated nonparties, rather than the entire world, and it depended on the group being small enough and enough actual claims being brought by members of the group.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 426 (2017)</ref>\n\n== History in the United States Federal Courts ==\n\n=== First 175 Years ===\nFor the first 175 years of the republic, courts typically did not enjoin defendants with respect to nonparties, especially if that defendant was the federal government. Some scholars have estimated that American federal courts issued a dozen national injunctions during this time, while others have estimated that American federal courts issued zero national injunctions during this time.<ref>Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen, Address at the Administrative Conference of the United States Forum on Nationwide Injunctions and Federal Regulatory Programs (Feb. 12, 2020).</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century, courts occasionally enjoined a municipality or county from enforcing a challenged tax or ordinance against nonparties. This was considered an extension of the \u201cbill of peace\u201d because it resolved a common claim by a small and cohesive group.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 427 (2017)</ref> The Supreme Court in ''[[Frothingham v. Mellon]]'' (1923) said this type of suit was justified by the theory that citizens of a county or municipality have a relationship comparable to that of shareholders to a corporation.<ref>Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 487 (1923)</ref>\n\nOne explanation for the lack of national injunctions is that the federal government itself waived its sovereign immunity from suit in 1976, while another is that venue and personal jurisdiction rules for a long time restricted litigants from suing cabinet officers outside of Washington, D.C. when seeking injunctions.<ref>Amici Curiae Legal Historians in Support of Plaintiff and Appellee the City of Chicago at 7, City of Chicago v. Whitaker, No. 18-2885 (7th Cir. Nov. 15, 2018))</ref>\n\nSome cases from this period raised questions about the lawfulness of national injunctions or closely-related remedies.\n\n* '''Scott v. Donald''' (1897) ''\u2014'' James Donald sued the state of South Carolina for confiscating his alcohol under a statute he argued violated the federal Constitution.<ref>Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 58, 66 (1897)</ref> In addition to damages, Donald asked the court to enjoin the state from enforcing the statute against anyone.<ref>Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 107, 115 (1897)</ref> Despite agreeing that the statute was unconstitutional,<ref>Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 107, 111 (1897)</ref> the Supreme Court held that \u201cwe are unable to wholly approve the decree entered in this case.\u201d<ref>Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 107, 115 (1897)</ref> The Court explained that \u201cthere may be others in like case with the plaintiff, and that such persons may be numerous, but such a state of facts is too conjectural to furnish a safe basis upon which a court of equity ought to grant an injunction.\u201d<ref>Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 107, 115 (1897)</ref>\n* '''Lewis Publishing Co. v. Morgan''' (1913) ''\u2014'' In 1913, the Supreme Court temporarily granted an order \u201crestraining the defendants . . . from enforcing or attempting to enforce the provisions of said statute, and particularly restraining them from denying to appellant and other newspaper publishers the privileges of the mail . . . .\u201d<ref>Mila Sohoni History of the 'Universal' Injunction, 133 Harv. L.

L. Rev. 920, 946 (2020)</ref> Professor Samuel Bray interpreted it as a matter of [[estoppel]] because the government had already promised to the court it would not enforce the provision against anyone during litigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yalejreg.com/nc/a-response-to-the-lost-history-of-the-universal-injunction-by-samuel-bray/|title=A Response to The Lost History of the \"Universal\" Injunction|last=Bray|first=Samuel|date=October 18, 2019|website=Yale Journal on Regulation|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n* '''[[Frothingham v. Mellon]]''' (1923) ''\u2014'' Harriet Frothingham sued the federal government for spending money under the Maternity Act, which she argued exceeded the powers of the federal government.<ref>Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 479 (1923).</ref> She asked the Supreme Court to enjoin the government from carrying out the provisions of this act with regard to her and nonparties alike.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 430-31 (2017)</ref> The Supreme Court held against her unanimously, reasoning that a Court could not provide such relief without \u201cassum[ing] a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and co-equal department, an authority which plainly we do not possess.\u201d<ref>Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 489 (1923)</ref>\n\n=== New Deal Challenges ===\nAfter the federal courts held numerous acts of [[New Deal]] legislation unconstitutional, they did not issue national injunctions. Sometimes over a thousand individual injunctions were granted with regard to a single provision, as each plaintiff brought suit to ensure that the statute could not apply to them.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 433-35 (2017)</ref>\n\n=== Late 20th Century ===\n[[Clarence Thomas|Justice Clarence Thomas]] has written that national injunctions \"emerg[ed] for the first time in the 1960s and dramatically increas[ed] in popularity only very recently.\"<ref>Trump v.

Tracing equity practices at common law, Bray has argued that a federal court may only give an injunction that \"protects the plaintiff vis\u00e0-vis the defendant, wherever the plaintiff and the defendant may both happen to be.\"<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 469 (2017)</ref> It cannot \"constrain the defendant\u2019s conduct vis\u00e0-vis nonparties.\"<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 469 (2017)</ref> That is because, he argues, a federal court \"has no constitutional basis to decide disputes and issue remedies for those who are not parties.\"<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 471 (2017)</ref> Bray has noted that, among other problems, the current practice could lead to \"conflicting injunctions,\" a situation where multiple parties bring suit, one court orders a defendant not to apply a statute or regulation against anyone, and another court orders the same defendant to ignore the first injunction or to continue to implement the statute or regulation.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 462-64 (2017)</ref> Professor Michael Morley has written several articles on national injunctions.<ref>See Michael T. Morley, Nationwide Injunctions, Rule 23(B)(2), and the Remedial Powers of the Lower Courts, 97 B.U. L. Rev. 615, 622-23 (2017)</ref> He has argued that national injunctions through a national \"class action\" are \"presumptively inappropriate,\" but may be lawful when the plaintiffs are asserting clearly established rights, the plaintiffs' rights are indivisible, the plaintiffs' claims are based on the burdens of the unconstitutionality of the challenged provisions, and it would be inappropriate to issue a narrower injunction.<ref>Michael T. Morley, Nationwide Injunctions, Rule 23(B)(2), and the Remedial Powers of the Lower Courts, 97 B.U. L. Rev. 615, 622 (2017)</ref>\n\nProfessor Mila Sohoni has argued that national injunctions are both constitutional and good.<ref>Mila Sohoni, The Lost History of the 'Universal' Injunction, 133 Harv. L. Rev. 920, 924 (2020)</ref> She argues that national injunctions were recognized as a valid remedial power of federal courts for almost all of the twentieth century, and perhaps even earlier.<ref>Mila Sohoni, The Lost History of the 'Universal' Injunction, 133 Harv. L. Rev. 920, 924 (2020)</ref> Similarly, attorneys David Hausman & Spencer E. Amdur have defended national injunctions because they can prevent widespread harm, such as deportations of hundreds of thousands of people.<ref>David Hausman & Spencer E. Amdur, Response, Nationwide Injunctions and Nationwide Harm, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 49, 49-50 (2017)</ref> Hausman and Amdur advocate such injunctions \"when necessary to prevent real-world injuries,\" under a framework that \"would otherwise preserve opportunities for percolation across multiple chancellors.\"<ref>David Hausman & Spencer E. Amdur, Response, Nationwide Injunctions and Nationwide Harm, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 49, 49-50 (2017)</ref> Professor Alan Trammell has argued that preclusion principles justify national injunctions specifically in cases \"when the government acts in bad faith, including most notably when government officials fail to abide by settled law.\"<ref>Alan M.

Hawaii]] concurrence, Justice Thomas noted that \"[i]njunctions that prohibit the Executive Branch from applying a law or policy against anyone\" have been called both \"nationwide\" and \"universal\" injunctions,<ref>Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2424 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring)</ref> but chose to use the latter term \"because it is more precise.\"<ref>Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2424 n.1 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring)</ref> He reasoned that such injunctions \"are distinctive because they prohibit the Government from enforcing a policy with respect to anyone, including nonparties\u2014not because they have wide geographic breadth.\"<ref>Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S. Ct. 2392, 2424 n.1 (2018) (Thomas, J., concurring)</ref> Justice Gorsuch, in his ''Department of Homeland Security v.

New York, 140 S. Ct. 599, 600 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring)</ref>\n\nProfessor Bray has written that \"'Nationwide injunction' is especially inapt, because it emphasizes territorial breadth, when the real point of distinction is that the injunction protects nonparties.\"<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv.

Whitaker, No. 18-2885 (7th Cir. Nov. 15, 2018)</ref> Courts did have the [[equitable power]] to enjoin defendants with regard to the plaintiff, but typically not the world at large.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 420 (2017)</ref> In cases where multiple parties had a common claim against the same defendant, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|British Chancellor]] sometimes offered a remedy known as a \u201c[[Bill of Peace|bill of peace]].\u201d<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 426 (2017)</ref> The bill of peace bound the defendant against that group of parties with a common claim, regardless of whether they were all parties in the case.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 426 (2017)</ref> For example, if several tenants brought a claim against a landlord that they shared in common with all tenants, then the court of equity might issue a remedy that applied to the landlord\u2019s relations with those tenants not before the court.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv.

Some scholars have estimated that American federal courts issued a dozen national injunctions during this time, while others have estimated that American federal courts issued zero national injunctions during this time.<ref>Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen, Address at the Administrative Conference of the United States Forum on Nationwide Injunctions and Federal Regulatory Programs (Feb. 12, 2020).</ref>\n\nIn the nineteenth century, courts occasionally enjoined a municipality or county from enforcing a challenged tax or ordinance against nonparties. This was considered an extension of the \u201cbill of peace\u201d because it resolved a common claim by a small and cohesive group.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 427 (2017)</ref> The Supreme Court in ''[[Frothingham v. Mellon]]'' (1923) said this type of suit was justified by the theory that citizens of a county or municipality have a relationship comparable to that of shareholders to a corporation.<ref>Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 487 (1923)</ref>\n\nOne explanation for the lack of national injunctions is that the federal government itself waived its sovereign immunity from suit in 1976, while another is that venue and personal jurisdiction rules for a long time restricted litigants from suing cabinet officers outside of Washington, D.C. when seeking injunctions.<ref>Amici Curiae Legal Historians in Support of Plaintiff and Appellee the City of Chicago at 7, City of Chicago v. Whitaker, No. 18-2885 (7th Cir. Nov. 15, 2018))</ref>\n\nSome cases from this period raised questions about the lawfulness of national injunctions or closely-related remedies.\n\n* '''Scott v.

Donald, 165 U.S. 107, 111 (1897)</ref> the Supreme Court held that \u201cwe are unable to wholly approve the decree entered in this case.\u201d<ref>Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 107, 115 (1897)</ref> The Court explained that \u201cthere may be others in like case with the plaintiff, and that such persons may be numerous, but such a state of facts is too conjectural to furnish a safe basis upon which a court of equity ought to grant an injunction.\u201d<ref>Scott v. Donald, 165 U.S. 107, 115 (1897)</ref>\n* '''Lewis Publishing Co. v. Morgan''' (1913) ''\u2014'' In 1913, the Supreme Court temporarily granted an order \u201crestraining the defendants . . . from enforcing or attempting to enforce the provisions of said statute, and particularly restraining them from denying to appellant and other newspaper publishers the privileges of the mail . . . .\u201d<ref>Mila Sohoni History of the 'Universal' Injunction, 133 Harv.

L. Rev. 417, 430-31 (2017)</ref> The Supreme Court held against her unanimously, reasoning that a Court could not provide such relief without \u201cassum[ing] a position of authority over the governmental acts of another and co-equal department, an authority which plainly we do not possess.\u201d<ref>Frothingham v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 489 (1923)</ref>\n\n=== New Deal Challenges ===\nAfter the federal courts held numerous acts of [[New Deal]] legislation unconstitutional, they did not issue national injunctions.

Tracing equity practices at common law, Bray has argued that a federal court may only give an injunction that \"protects the plaintiff vis\u00e0-vis the defendant, wherever the plaintiff and the defendant may both happen to be.\"<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 469 (2017)</ref> It cannot \"constrain the defendant\u2019s conduct vis\u00e0-vis nonparties.\"<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 469 (2017)</ref> That is because, he argues, a federal court \"has no constitutional basis to decide disputes and issue remedies for those who are not parties.\"<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 471 (2017)</ref> Bray has noted that, among other problems, the current practice could lead to \"conflicting injunctions,\" a situation where multiple parties bring suit, one court orders a defendant not to apply a statute or regulation against anyone, and another court orders the same defendant to ignore the first injunction or to continue to implement the statute or regulation.<ref>Samuel Bray, Multiple Chancellors: Reforming the National Injunction, 131 Harv. L. Rev. 417, 462-64 (2017)</ref> Professor Michael Morley has written several articles on national injunctions.<ref>See Michael T. Morley, Nationwide Injunctions, Rule 23(B)(2), and the Remedial Powers of the Lower Courts, 97 B.U. L. Rev. 615, 622-23 (2017)</ref> He has argued that national injunctions through a national \"class action\" are \"presumptively inappropriate,\" but may be lawful when the plaintiffs are asserting clearly established rights, the plaintiffs' rights are indivisible, the plaintiffs' claims are based on the burdens of the unconstitutionality of the challenged provisions, and it would be inappropriate to issue a narrower injunction.<ref>Michael T.

Amdur, Response, Nationwide Injunctions and Nationwide Harm, 131 Harv. L.
