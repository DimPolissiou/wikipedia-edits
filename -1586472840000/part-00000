Whereas location may determine how certain processes around a contributing device operate, context may be applied more flexibly with mobile users, especially with users of [[smart phones]]. Context awareness originated as a term from [[ubiquitous computing]] or as so-called pervasive computing which sought to deal with linking changes in the environment with computer systems, which are otherwise static. The term has also been applied to business theory in relation to [[contextual application design]] and [[business process management]] issues.<ref name=\"rosemann2006\">{{cite conference\n| author = Rosemann, M., & Recker, J.\n| year = 2006\n| title = Context-aware process design: Exploring the extrinsic drivers for process flexibility\n| booktitle = 18th international conference on advanced information systems engineering.

Beyond more advanced modalities may apply when not only single entities are addressed, but also clusters of entities that work in a coherence of context, as e.g. teams at work or also single bearers with a multiplicity of appliances.\n\nSome classical understanding of context in business processes is derived from the definition of AAA applications<ref>[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/security/configuration/guide/scfaaa.html CISCO AAA Overview]</ref> with the following three categories:\n* Authentication, which means i.e. confirmation of stated identity\n* Authorisation, which means i.e. allowance to accrual or access  to location, function, data\n* Accounting, which means i.e. the relation to order context and to accounts for applied labour, granted license, and delivered goods,\nthese three terms including additionally location and time as stated.\n\n== Computer science ==\nIn computer science ''context awareness'' refers to the idea that computers can both sense, and react based on their environment.

Since the early 1990s, researchers have developed a large number of software and hardware systems that can collect contextual information (e.g., location, video feeds, away status messages) from users.  This information is then openly shared with other users, thereby improving their situational awareness, and allowing them to identify natural opportunities to interact with each other.  In the early days of context-aware computing, many of the systems developed for this purpose were specifically designed to assist businesses or geographically separated work teams collaborate on shared documents or work artifacts.  More recently, however, there has been a growing body of work that demonstrates how this technique can also be applied to groups of friends or family members to help keep them apprised of each other's activities.\n\nTo date, systems that use context awareness to improve situational awareness can be characterised by:\n* the context(s) that they collect from each user, and \n* the method by which they convey this information to other users\n\nThe most common context to obtain and share for the purposes of improving situational awareness is the user's location. In an early prototype, the Active Badge system,<ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Want, R. |author2=Hopper, A. |author3=Falcao, V. |author4= Gibbons, J. |last-author-amp=yes| year = 1992\n| title = The Active Badge Location System\n| journal = ACM Transactions on Information Systems\n| volume = 10\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 91\u2013102|doi=10.1145/128756.128759 |citeseerx=10.1.1.17.339 }}</ref> for example, each user had a uniquely identifying badge that could be tracked via a series of overhead infrared sensors.  As users walked throughout a building, their location was constantly monitored by a centralized server.  Other users could then view this information (either in text form, or on a map, as was done in later work<ref>{{cite book |author1= McCarthy, J. F. |author2= Meidel, E.

In comparison with Active Badge, which only displays location information, these systems are more proactive, and will alert the users when they are in proximity of each other.  This lets the user know when a potential interaction opportunity is available, thereby increasing his/her chances of taking advantage of it.\n\nAnother popular context to share is a user's work activity, often by sharing video. In the Community Bar system,<ref>{{cite conference\n|author1=Tee, K. |author2=Greenberg, S. |author3=Gutwin, C. |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2006\n| title = Providing Artifact Awareness to a Distributed Group Through Screen Sharing\n| booktitle = CSCW '06\n| pages = 99\u2013108|url=https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/1880/45901/2006-828-21.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y}}</ref> researchers developed a desktop application that periodically took screenshots of the user's display.

This capability to \"glance\" at another user lets users see if they are busy or preoccupied, which in turn helps them better determine the most opportune time to initiate a conversation.\n\nA third type of context to share to improve or enhance situational awareness is the user's audio. In the Thunderwire system,<ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Ackerman, M. |author2=Hindus, D. |author3=Mainwaring, S. |author4=Starr, B. |last-author-amp=yes| year = 1997\n| title = Hanging on the 'Wire: A Field Study of an Audio-Only Media Space\n| journal = ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction\n| volume = 4\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 39\u201366|doi=10.1145/244754.244756 }}</ref> researchers developed an audio-only media space that allowed friends to share  raw audio from their mobile devices' microphones.

Unlike Thunderwire, however, these systems rely on machine learning algorithms in order to analyze the user's audio and determine if the user is talking. This allows the system to provide other users with the same context (i.e., whether or not the user is in a conversation) without having to share the actual audio, thereby making it more privacy centric.\n\nA fourth type of context that is commonly shared is the user's overall activity.  In the Hubbub<ref>{{cite conference\n|author1=Isaacs, E. |author2=Walendowski, A. |author3= Ranganthan, D |last-author-amp=yes| year = 2002\n| title = Hubbub: A Sound-Enhanced Mobile Instant Messenger that Supports Awareness and Opportunistic Interactions\n| booktitle = CHI '02\n| pages = 333\u2013340|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221518280}}</ref> and Conchat<ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Ranganathan, A. |author2=Campbell, R.

This information could then be provided to other users to let them know if and when their friends were available to respond to their messages.  In the Digital Family Portrait system,<ref>{{cite conference\n|author1=Mynatt, E.D. |author2=Rowan, J. |author3=Craighill, S. |author4= Jacobs, A |last-author-amp=yes| year = 2001\n| title = Digital family portraits: supporting peace of mind for extended family members\n| booktitle = CHI '01\n| pages = 333\u2013340|url=http://www.cc.gt.atl.ga.us/fce/ahri/publications/dfp-chi2001.pdf}}</ref> researchers developed a digital picture frame that provides qualitative visualizations of a user's (i.e., an elderly parent/grandparent) daily activities.  This visualization is then provided to the user's adult children so that they could \"check up\" on their parents without having to explicitly bother them, thereby allowing them to \"age in place.\"\n\nAlthough these system demonstrate how context awareness can be used to support situational and social awareness, the long term effectiveness of these systems are not yet fully understood.  Many of the systems described above have only been evaluated at a conceptual level, or to demonstrate that the system is technically feasible.  Consequently, while initial results from these studies suggest that context awareness can support situational awareness tasks, more longitudinal data is required.\n\n== Application in health care ==\nContext-aware mobile [[Software agent|agents]]<ref>[http://recursionsw.com/About_Us/inc/White_papers/Voyager_3rd_Party/Context_Aware_Mobile_Agents_Healthcare.pdf Burstein et.al.

Modern integrated (voice and) data communications equips the workshop or production line staff with smart phones to communicate data with production control for feedback, where data originates from detecting and identifying components and parts to get integrated in flexible production management for on-demand products.\n\nHowever, all attempts to support staff with such approaches are hampered by fixed production schedules unless the information for customer demand and product configuration can be matched with parts supply. Hence a well suited solution has to get rid of missing interaction of production plan and production line occurrence of relevant information and material by means of\n\n* automated identifying actually available parts delivered from stock or out of buffer supplies,\n* automated presenting of the integration requirements for on-demand configuration,\n* automated detecting and reporting of the actually mounted configuration\n  \nThe key requirement is to implement a solution free from manual interaction of worker with information handling. Otherwise the error rate will rise with the rise in information requirements.\n\nAdditionally, none of the conventional RFID, WLAN or RTLS locating solutions advertising for most precise locating serve the required quality, as determining a location in conventional attitude looking for absolute coordinates fails either technically or economically. Other approaches based on [[fuzzy locating]] promise better return on investment.\n\n==Applications in pervasive games==\n\nA [[pervasive game]] is leveraging the sensed human contexts to adapt game system behaviors. By blending of real and virtual elements and enabling users to physically interact with their surroundings during the play, people can become fully involved in and attain better gaming experience.

Since the early 1990s, researchers have developed a large number of software and hardware systems that can collect contextual information (e.g., location, video feeds, away status messages) from users.  This information is then openly shared with other users, thereby improving their situational awareness, and allowing them to identify natural opportunities to interact with each other.  In the early days of context-aware computing, many of the systems developed for this purpose were specifically designed to assist businesses or geographically separated work teams collaborate on shared documents or work artifacts.  More recently, however, there has been a growing body of work that demonstrates how this technique can also be applied to groups of friends or family members to help keep them apprised of each other's activities.\n\nTo date, systems that use context awareness to improve situational awareness can be characterised by:\n* the context(s) that they collect from each user, and \n* the method by which they convey this information to other users\n\nThe most common context to obtain and share for the purposes of improving situational awareness is the user's location. In an early prototype, the Active Badge system,<ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Want, R. |author2=Hopper, A. |author3=Falcao, V. |author4= Gibbons, J. |last-author-amp=yes| year = 1992\n| title = The Active Badge Location System\n| journal = ACM Transactions on Information Systems\n| volume = 10\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 91\u2013102|doi=10.1145/128756.128759 |citeseerx=10.1.1.17.339 }}</ref> for example, each user had a uniquely identifying badge that could be tracked via a series of overhead infrared sensors.  As users walked throughout a building, their location was constantly monitored by a centralized server.  Other users could then view this information (either in text form, or on a map, as was done in later work<ref>{{cite book |author1= McCarthy, J. F. |author2= Meidel, E.

In comparison with Active Badge, which only displays location information, these systems are more proactive, and will alert the users when they are in proximity of each other.  This lets the user know when a potential interaction opportunity is available, thereby increasing his/her chances of taking advantage of it.\n\nAnother popular context to share is a user's work activity, often by sharing video. In the Community Bar system,<ref>{{cite conference\n|author1=Tee, K. |author2=Greenberg, S. |author3=Gutwin, C. |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2006\n| title = Providing Artifact Awareness to a Distributed Group Through Screen Sharing\n| booktitle = CSCW '06\n| pages = 99\u2013108|url=https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/1880/45901/2006-828-21.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y}}</ref> researchers developed a desktop application that periodically took screenshots of the user's display. This information was then shared with the user's co-workers so that they could know what documents/artifacts their teammates was working on, and provided a common frame of reference so that users could n talk about these artifacts as if they were collocated. In Montage,<ref>{{cite conference\n|author1=Tang, J.  |author2=Rua, M. \n| year = 1994\n| title = Montage: Providing Teleproximity for Distributed Groups\n| booktitle = CHI '94\n| pages = 37\u201343\n|citeseerx=10.1.1.476.2157 \n}}</ref> users are given the ability to remotely activate the webcam on another user's computer for a brief amount of time. This capability to \"glance\" at another user lets users see if they are busy or preoccupied, which in turn helps them better determine the most opportune time to initiate a conversation.\n\nA third type of context to share to improve or enhance situational awareness is the user's audio. In the Thunderwire system,<ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Ackerman, M. |author2=Hindus, D. |author3=Mainwaring, S. |author4=Starr, B. |last-author-amp=yes| year = 1997\n| title = Hanging on the 'Wire: A Field Study of an Audio-Only Media Space\n| journal = ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction\n| volume = 4\n| issue = 1\n| pages = 39\u201366|doi=10.1145/244754.244756 }}</ref> researchers developed an audio-only media space that allowed friends to share  raw audio from their mobile devices' microphones.

Unlike Thunderwire, however, these systems rely on machine learning algorithms in order to analyze the user's audio and determine if the user is talking. This allows the system to provide other users with the same context (i.e., whether or not the user is in a conversation) without having to share the actual audio, thereby making it more privacy centric.\n\nA fourth type of context that is commonly shared is the user's overall activity.  In the Hubbub<ref>{{cite conference\n|author1=Isaacs, E. |author2=Walendowski, A. |author3= Ranganthan, D |last-author-amp=yes| year = 2002\n| title = Hubbub: A Sound-Enhanced Mobile Instant Messenger that Supports Awareness and Opportunistic Interactions\n| booktitle = CHI '02\n| pages = 333\u2013340|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221518280}}</ref> and Conchat<ref>{{cite journal\n|author1=Ranganathan, A. |author2=Campbell, R.

This information could then be provided to other users to let them know if and when their friends were available to respond to their messages.  In the Digital Family Portrait system,<ref>{{cite conference\n|author1=Mynatt, E.D. |author2=Rowan, J. |author3=Craighill, S. |author4= Jacobs, A |last-author-amp=yes| year = 2001\n| title = Digital family portraits: supporting peace of mind for extended family members\n| booktitle = CHI '01\n| pages = 333\u2013340|url=http://www.cc.gt.atl.ga.us/fce/ahri/publications/dfp-chi2001.pdf}}</ref> researchers developed a digital picture frame that provides qualitative visualizations of a user's (i.e., an elderly parent/grandparent) daily activities.  This visualization is then provided to the user's adult children so that they could \"check up\" on their parents without having to explicitly bother them, thereby allowing them to \"age in place.\"\n\nAlthough these system demonstrate how context awareness can be used to support situational and social awareness, the long term effectiveness of these systems are not yet fully understood.  Many of the systems described above have only been evaluated at a conceptual level, or to demonstrate that the system is technically feasible.  Consequently, while initial results from these studies suggest that context awareness can support situational awareness tasks, more longitudinal data is required.\n\n== Application in health care ==\nContext-aware mobile [[Software agent|agents]]<ref>[http://recursionsw.com/About_Us/inc/White_papers/Voyager_3rd_Party/Context_Aware_Mobile_Agents_Healthcare.pdf Burstein et.al.

Modern integrated (voice and) data communications equips the workshop or production line staff with smart phones to communicate data with production control for feedback, where data originates from detecting and identifying components and parts to get integrated in flexible production management for on-demand products.\n\nHowever, all attempts to support staff with such approaches are hampered by fixed production schedules unless the information for customer demand and product configuration can be matched with parts supply. Hence a well suited solution has to get rid of missing interaction of production plan and production line occurrence of relevant information and material by means of\n\n* automated identifying actually available parts delivered from stock or out of buffer supplies,\n* automated presenting of the integration requirements for on-demand configuration,\n* automated detecting and reporting of the actually mounted configuration\n  \nThe key requirement is to implement a solution free from manual interaction of worker with information handling. Otherwise the error rate will rise with the rise in information requirements.\n\nAdditionally, none of the conventional RFID, WLAN or RTLS locating solutions advertising for most precise locating serve the required quality, as determining a location in conventional attitude looking for absolute coordinates fails either technically or economically. Other approaches based on [[fuzzy locating]] promise better return on investment.\n\n==Applications in pervasive games==\n\nA [[pervasive game]] is leveraging the sensed human contexts to adapt game system behaviors. By blending of real and virtual elements and enabling users to physically interact with their surroundings during the play, people can become fully involved in and attain better gaming experience. For example, a pervasive game that uses the contexts of human activity and location in [[smart home]]s is reported by an [[autonomous agent]].<ref>[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11042-010-0711-z?LI=true B.

It continued in reruns until July 1, 2006. The show was produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]] with animation provided by [[Dong Yang Animation]].\n\n''Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island'' takes place on an island inhabited exclusively by fruit. The residents enjoy their own tropical paradise without a care in the world; they must share their peaceful utopia with the joyfully strange Coconut Fred, a whimsical, blissfully foolish coconut with the special ability to materialize anything he thinks about. The plot revolves around the adventures of Fred and his friends, as his boundless imagination springs to life while his friends struggle to cover up the collateral. Any conflict could range from getting a \u201cfruit canal\u201d, to sailing off the island only to find themselves in a humongous storm. Spongebob ripoff\n\n==Main characters==\n[[File:Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island.jpg|right|thumb|Main characters of the series.]]\n*'''Coconut Fred''' (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]): A happy-go-lucky [[coconut]] with a strange imagination. Fred has the special ability to turn whatever he imagines into reality. He can often be heard saying his trademark catchphrases, \"Yay me!\" and \"Now you're talking, coconut!\"\n*'''Bingo Cherry''' (voiced by [[Tracey Moore]] for the first two episodes and by [[Britt McKillip]] for the remainder of the series): A shy and timid [[cherry]]. Bingo usually hangs out with Fred, Slip and Slide, and Bunga Berry. Bingo is easily terrified, something that Fred doesn't know and usually provokes.\n*'''Slip & Slide D'Peel''' (both voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]): 'Country' [[banana]] brothers. They are less intelligent than the rest of the cast, and often take things a little too seriously. There is no clear way of telling them apart unless Fred or another character identifies just one of them. They're in a band with Fred called \"Coconut Fred's All-Body Sound Band\", and their music consists mainly of bodily sounds (burping, rude armpit noises, gargling, etc.). \n*'''Mr. Mel Greenrind''' (voiced by [[Michael Donovan]]): A [[watermelon]]. Most commonly assisted by Bingo, Mr. Greenrind routinely attempts to keep everything and everyone in order on the island with his chart of rules known as the squeaky board. A lot of the rules on the squeaky board are really nonsensical, but all of which can be applied to Coconut Fred and his friends. Fred has a tendency to get on Mr. Greenrind's nerves, and sometimes stress him out from all of his antics, though as the series progresses, he was able to show friendliness towards Fred (which usually wouldn't last long).\n*'''Wedgie''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]): A [[lemon]] who works as a sailor. He ended up on Fruit Salad Island due to Fred's intervention. Wedgie spends a great deal of time talking to \"Betty\", the wooden figurehead. He often fabricates plans to escape from the island, all of which are foiled by Fred's antics, either directly or indirectly.\n*'''Bunga Berry''' (Voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]]): A mute wild [[strawberry]]. Bunga communicates exclusively in grunts and growls. Despite this, everyone is still able to understand what he is saying, and is docile enough to interact with other islanders calmly.\n\n===Others===\n*'''Butchy''' (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]): A gravenstein [[apple]]. He is well known as the island's troublemaking bully. He once frightened Bingo, except Fred.\n*'''Black Berry''': Butchy's secretary. As his name describes, he's a [[blackberry]]. Butchy keeps him in his pocket. A parody of the [[BlackBerry]] [[Personal digital assistant]].\n*'''Tiffany Pears''' (voiced by [[Britt McKillip]]): A famous singer on Fruit Salad Island. Everybody likes her music except for Mr. Greenrind. In the episode \"The Ripley Van Ripend Book of World Records\" she had the record for most off-key singer ever to perform in public. Her name is a parody of [[Britney Spears]].\n*'''B.L. Tomato''' (voiced by [[Ashleigh Ball]]): An outcast [[tomato]] that is trying to find out if he's a fruit or a vegetable (although, a tomato is actually a fruit). In the Season 2 episode \"Captain Nut and the Power Fruits\", he joined Blendark, Captain Nut's arch-enemy, and turned to the dark side with a new name, the Tomatonator. Aside from the title song, he never starred in any other episode.\n*'''Rusty Candoo''': Fred's friend. He's a can of fruit. His only appearances are the title song and the episodes: \"Hocus Pocus Lack of Focus\" and \"Amuse-Otel\". After Amuse-Otel, he never appeared again (except still for the title song and a cameo in \"Fred Rules\").\n*'''Slurpy''' (voiced by [[Eddie Deezen]]): A fruit bat who is bent on eating Fruit Salad Island inhabitants. He is afraid of the light.\n*'''Melanie Greenrind''' (voiced by [[Maria Bamford]]): Mr. Greenrind's perky niece. She likes to enforce rules even more than her uncle, and carries around a very noisy chalkboard.\n*'''Vic the Alien''': An [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] from Loft Lost 57 in the Sasaft Quadrant in the depths of other space. After being mistaken as a tourist to Fred and the island, he was actually planning to invade the island with his spaceship fleet, but because of Fred and his friends playing in his ship and almost destroying them by going into [[black holes]] and ramming into [[asteroids]], he aborted the invasion and Fred crashed the ship into Mr. Greenrind's sand castle [[Cabana (structure)|cabana]]. They all survived the crash. This was the only appearance of Vic on the show. The episode he was in was the second season \"Turn On Your Nut Light\".\n*'''Mrs. Plumcott''' (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]]): The token little old [[plum]] lady of the island. She hates Mr. Greenrind. Her favorite line is, \"Oh dear.\"\n*'''Dr. Bartlett''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]): Dr. Bartlett is a [[pear]] dentist on Fruit Salad Island.\n\n==Reception==\nDespite some critics praising the animation and creativity, as well as some elements of the comedy, the series has been panned for its often loud, over-the-top humor.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{Cite book|last=Perlmutter|first=David|year=2018|title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows|edition=1st|page=131|publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]]|isbn=978-1538103739}}</ref> Joly Herman of ''Common Sense Media'' posted a review of ''Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island'' on [[Go.com]]. The review describes the show as \"the TV equivalent of sugary [[cereal]], and nothing more\", and proceeded to give the show two stars out of five.<ref>\"[http://family.go.com/entertainment/article-csm-81413-tv-review--coconut-fred-s-fruit-salad-island-t/ TV Review: Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island]\", ''Common Sense Media'' on [[Go.com]]</ref>\n\n[[Rob Paulsen]], who voiced the main character Coconut Fred, stated that he does not like to remember voicing the character, and said that it was nothing more than a shameless ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' knockoff.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/> \n\nDue to the poor feedback that the show received, the originally 13-episode first season was cut short to nine episodes, and the show went on a 5-month hiatus. The final four episodes were branded as Season Two, and the extremely short second season aired throughout May 2006, after which the series was cancelled.\n\n==Series overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Season\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Episodes\n! colspan=\"2\" |Originally aired\n|-\n!

It continued in reruns until July 1, 2006. The show was produced by [[Warner Bros. Animation]] with animation provided by [[Dong Yang Animation]].\n\n''Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island'' takes place on an island inhabited exclusively by fruit. The residents enjoy their own tropical paradise without a care in the world; they must share their peaceful utopia with the joyfully strange Coconut Fred, a whimsical, blissfully foolish coconut with the special ability to materialize anything he thinks about. The plot revolves around the adventures of Fred and his friends, as his boundless imagination springs to life while his friends struggle to cover up the collateral. Any conflict could range from getting a \u201cfruit canal\u201d, to sailing off the island only to find themselves in a humongous storm.\n\n==Main characters==\n[[File:Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island.jpg|right|thumb|Main characters of the series.]]\n*'''Coconut Fred''' (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]): A happy-go-lucky [[coconut]] with a strange imagination. Fred has the special ability to turn whatever he imagines into reality. He can often be heard saying his trademark catchphrases, \"Yay me!\" and \"Now you're talking, coconut!\"\n*'''Bingo Cherry''' (voiced by [[Tracey Moore]] for the first two episodes and by [[Britt McKillip]] for the remainder of the series): A shy and timid [[cherry]]. Bingo usually hangs out with Fred, Slip and Slide, and Bunga Berry. Bingo is easily terrified, something that Fred doesn't know and usually provokes.\n*'''Slip & Slide D'Peel''' (both voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]): 'Country' [[banana]] brothers. They are less intelligent than the rest of the cast, and often take things a little too seriously. There is no clear way of telling them apart unless Fred or another character identifies just one of them. They're in a band with Fred called \"Coconut Fred's All-Body Sound Band\", and their music consists mainly of bodily sounds (burping, rude armpit noises, gargling, etc.). \n*'''Mr. Mel Greenrind''' (voiced by [[Michael Donovan]]): A [[watermelon]]. Most commonly assisted by Bingo, Mr. Greenrind routinely attempts to keep everything and everyone in order on the island with his chart of rules known as the squeaky board. A lot of the rules on the squeaky board are really nonsensical, but all of which can be applied to Coconut Fred and his friends. Fred has a tendency to get on Mr. Greenrind's nerves, and sometimes stress him out from all of his antics, though as the series progresses, he was able to show friendliness towards Fred (which usually wouldn't last long).\n*'''Wedgie''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]): A [[lemon]] who works as a sailor. He ended up on Fruit Salad Island due to Fred's intervention. Wedgie spends a great deal of time talking to \"Betty\", the wooden figurehead. He often fabricates plans to escape from the island, all of which are foiled by Fred's antics, either directly or indirectly.\n*'''Bunga Berry''' (Voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]]): A mute wild [[strawberry]]. Bunga communicates exclusively in grunts and growls. Despite this, everyone is still able to understand what he is saying, and is docile enough to interact with other islanders calmly.\n\n===Others===\n*'''Butchy''' (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]): A gravenstein [[apple]]. He is well known as the island's troublemaking bully. He once frightened Bingo, except Fred.\n*'''Black Berry''': Butchy's secretary. As his name describes, he's a [[blackberry]]. Butchy keeps him in his pocket. A parody of the [[BlackBerry]] [[Personal digital assistant]].\n*'''Tiffany Pears''' (voiced by [[Britt McKillip]]): A famous singer on Fruit Salad Island. Everybody likes her music except for Mr. Greenrind. In the episode \"The Ripley Van Ripend Book of World Records\" she had the record for most off-key singer ever to perform in public. Her name is a parody of [[Britney Spears]].\n*'''B.L. Tomato''' (voiced by [[Ashleigh Ball]]): An outcast [[tomato]] that is trying to find out if he's a fruit or a vegetable (although, a tomato is actually a fruit). In the Season 2 episode \"Captain Nut and the Power Fruits\", he joined Blendark, Captain Nut's arch-enemy, and turned to the dark side with a new name, the Tomatonator. Aside from the title song, he never starred in any other episode.\n*'''Rusty Candoo''': Fred's friend. He's a can of fruit. His only appearances are the title song and the episodes: \"Hocus Pocus Lack of Focus\" and \"Amuse-Otel\". After Amuse-Otel, he never appeared again (except still for the title song and a cameo in \"Fred Rules\").\n*'''Slurpy''' (voiced by [[Eddie Deezen]]): A fruit bat who is bent on eating Fruit Salad Island inhabitants. He is afraid of the light.\n*'''Melanie Greenrind''' (voiced by [[Maria Bamford]]): Mr. Greenrind's perky niece. She likes to enforce rules even more than her uncle, and carries around a very noisy chalkboard.\n*'''Vic the Alien''': An [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] from Loft Lost 57 in the Sasaft Quadrant in the depths of other space. After being mistaken as a tourist to Fred and the island, he was actually planning to invade the island with his spaceship fleet, but because of Fred and his friends playing in his ship and almost destroying them by going into [[black holes]] and ramming into [[asteroids]], he aborted the invasion and Fred crashed the ship into Mr. Greenrind's sand castle [[Cabana (structure)|cabana]]. They all survived the crash. This was the only appearance of Vic on the show. The episode he was in was the second season \"Turn On Your Nut Light\".\n*'''Mrs. Plumcott''' (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]]): The token little old [[plum]] lady of the island. She hates Mr. Greenrind. Her favorite line is, \"Oh dear.\"\n*'''Dr. Bartlett''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]): Dr. Bartlett is a [[pear]] dentist on Fruit Salad Island.\n\n==Reception==\nDespite some critics praising the animation and creativity, as well as some elements of the comedy, the series has been panned for its often loud, over-the-top humor.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{Cite book|last=Perlmutter|first=David|year=2018|title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows|edition=1st|page=131|publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]]|isbn=978-1538103739}}</ref> Joly Herman of ''Common Sense Media'' posted a review of ''Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island'' on [[Go.com]]. The review describes the show as \"the TV equivalent of sugary [[cereal]], and nothing more\", and proceeded to give the show two stars out of five.<ref>\"[http://family.go.com/entertainment/article-csm-81413-tv-review--coconut-fred-s-fruit-salad-island-t/ TV Review: Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island]\", ''Common Sense Media'' on [[Go.com]]</ref>\n\n[[Rob Paulsen]], who voiced the main character Coconut Fred, stated that he does not like to remember voicing the character, and said that it was nothing more than a shameless ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' knockoff.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/> \n\nDue to the poor feedback that the show received, the originally 13-episode first season was cut short to nine episodes, and the show went on a 5-month hiatus.

The lines, '''Routes 10, 11, 13, 34, and 36''', collectively operate on about {{convert|39.6|mi|km}} of route.<ref name=\"Railopenings\">{{cite web | url=http://www.septa.org/ | last=Smith, Jr. | first=Bill W. | title=U.S. Urban Rail Transit Lines Opened From 1980 | website=SEPTA.org | pages = 1-100 | format=pdf | date=November 2011 | accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref>\n\nSEPTA's [[SEPTA Route 15|Route 15]], the [[Girard Avenue]] Line, is another streetcar line that is designated green on route maps but is not part of the subway\u2013surface system.\n\nLike [[Boston]]'s [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] and [[San Francisco]]'s [[Muni Metro]], the SEPTA trolley line is the descendant of a pre-World War II streetcar system. Where Boston and San Francisco's systems use longer, articulated [[light rail|LRT]] vehicles, Philadelphia uses rigid vehicles roughly four inches longer than the [[PCC streetcar]] they somewhat replaced. The lines use [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company|Kawasaki]] K-Car LRVs delivered in 1981-82. The cars are similar to those on [[SEPTA Routes 101 and 102|Routes 101 and 102]], SEPTA's suburban trolley routes, which were delivered around the same time. However, the subway\u2013surface cars are single-ended and use [[trolley pole]]s, while the suburban lines use double ended cars and [[Pantograph (transport)|pantographs]] for power collection.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Center City===\nStarting from their eastern terminus at [[13th Street station (SEPTA)|13th Street Station]] near [[City Hall (Philadelphia)|City Hall]], the trolleys loop around in a tunnel under City Hall before stopping at under [[Dilworth Park]] at [[15th Street station (SEPTA)|15th Street station]] and then realign back under [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]].\n\nAll five routes also stop at [[19th Street (SEPTA station)|19th Street]], [[22nd Street (SEPTA station)|22nd Street]], [[30th Street station (subway)|30th Street]], and [[33rd Street (SEPTA station)|33rd Street]], which are all underground stations. From 15th to 30th Streets, they run in the same tunnel as SEPTA's [[Market\u2013Frankford Line]], which runs express on the inner tracks while the trolleys utilize the outer ones.\n\nPassengers may transfer free of charge to the Market\u2013Frankford Line at 13th, 15th, and 30th Streets, as well as to the [[Broad Street Line]] at 15th Street. Connections to the [[SEPTA Regional Rail|Regional Rail]] are also available via underground passageways connecting 13th and 15th Street stations to [[Suburban Station]], one of the city's main commuter rail terminals.\n\n===University City===\nAfter traveling under the [[Schuylkill River]], the trolley lines provide access to [[30th Street Station]], a passenger terminal located across the street from the trolley and rapid transit station. Connection is available to Regional Rail, many [[Amtrak]] services, and [[New Jersey Transit]]'s [[Atlantic City Line]]. An underground passageway that connects these two stations is currently closed. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The closure was due to passenger safety issues after a passenger attack in the 1990s. In 2016, the 30th Street Station District proposed overhauling both 30th Street Station's SEPTA and trolley stations including, by public demand, the reopening the tunnel that connects the two (currently separate) stations, thus ceasing the need for passengers to resurface, walk outside to cross the busy 30th Street, and then enter the other station. The timeline called for the tunnel overhaul to be part of Phase 1 and thus completed by 2020. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://planphilly.com/articles/2016/03/15/30th-street-station-district-draft-plan-reopen-septa-tunnel-by-2020-cap-rail-yards-by-2050|title=30th Street Station District draft plan: Reopen SEPTA tunnel by 2020, cap rail yards by 2050|work=PlanPhilly {{!}} 30th Street Station District draft plan: Reopen SEPTA tunnel by 2020, cap rail yards by 2050|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAll routes then stop at 33rd Street, near Drexel University. After this stop, Route 10 diverts from the others and emerges from the tunnel at the [[36th Street Portal]] just south of Market Street, then turns north onto 36th Street and then northwest along [[Lancaster Avenue]] and other surface streets. The other four lines make underground stops at [[36th Street station (SEPTA)|36th and Sansom streets]] and [[37th Street station (SEPTA)|37th and Spruce streets]] on the campus of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] before surfacing at the [[40th Street Portal]] near [[Baltimore Avenue]], heading southwest on surface streets.\n\n===Points south and west===\n{{expand section|date=February 2018}}\nThe Route 11 line travels along Woodland Avenue in Philadelphia and Main Street in [[Darby, Pennsylvania|Darby]]. It crosses a [[CSX Transportation]] railroad line at grade, one of very few at-grade crossing between a trolley line and a major freight rail line in the United States.

At [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]], the line connects to the [[Market\u2013Frankford Line]] at its [[40th Street station (SEPTA)|40th Street station]]. The surface tracks continue southbound to [[Spruce Street (Philadelphia)|Spruce Street]], where they split either eastbound or westbound. Westbound tracks run to 42nd Street where they turn south to either Baltimore Avenue (Route 34), Chester Avenue (Route 13), or Woodland Avenue (Routes 11 and 36).\n\nTracks for the other four routes run northbound along 42nd Street, then turning east onto Spruce Street and then north onto 38th Street ([[U.S. Route 13 in Pennsylvania|US 13]]). From here, it travels to Filbert Street, then turning left and crossing the 40th Street tracks. When Filbert Street terminates at 41st Street, the tracks turn right, and head north until reaching Lancaster Avenue.<ref>[http://www.septa.org/maps/trolley/city.html SEPTA trolley lines map]</ref>\n\nAnother set of diversionary trolley tracks begin near the [[49th Street station (SEPTA Regional Rail)|49th Street Regional Rail station]], connecting Chester Avenue to Woodland Avenue (where Routes 11 and 36 separate) by way of 49th Street.\n\n==History==\n[[File:University of Pennsylvania College Hall.jpg|right|thumb|[[College Hall (University of Pennsylvania)|College Hall]] and Logan Hall on the campus of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], as viewed from Woodland Avenue c. 1892.]]\n[[File:SEPTA Subway-Surface map.png|thumb|Schematic map of subway\u2013surface branches and termini]]\nThe subway\u2013surface lines are remnants of the far more extensive streetcar system that developed in Philadelphia after the arrival of electric trolleys in 1892. Several dozen traction companies were consolidated in 1902 into the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company. The PRT funneled the West Philadelphia lines into subway tunnels as they approached the city center. After the PRT declared bankruptcy in 1939, it was reopened as the [[Philadelphia Transportation Company]] (PTC), which was absorbed into SEPTA in 1968.<ref name=\"route34\">{{cite web| url=http://studio34yoga.com/about-us/our-trolley/ | title=Studio 34's Eponymous Trolley, or, A Short History of Route 34 | accessdate=2008-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2006, [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s class of 1956 funded the construction of an innovative portal for one of the eastbound entrances of the [[37th Street station (SEPTA)|37th Street station]]: a replica of a [[Peter Witt streetcar|Peter Witt]] trolley of the kind manufactured by [[J. G. Brill and Company]] from 1923\u201326. Operated by the Philadelphia Transportation Company, these trolleys brought university students to the campus and to [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]] until 1956. Routes 11, 34 and 37 ran through the Penn campus on Woodland Avenue and Locust Streets for nearly 65 years. In 1956, the trolley route was buried to enable the university to unify its campus, with Woodland Avenue and Locust Street becoming pedestrian walkways.\n\n==Routes==\nAll routes terminate at [[15th Street station (SEPTA)|15th Street station]] between 12:30 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. when 13th Street is closed. On Sunday evenings and during unexpected diversions, all routes are diverted to surface streets and terminate at [[40th Street station (SEPTA)|40th Street station]].

The lines, '''Routes 10, 11, 13, 34, and 36''', collectively operate on about {{convert|39.6|mi|km}} of route.<ref name=\"Railopenings\">{{cite web | url=http://www.septa.org/ | last=Smith, Jr. | first=Bill W. | title=U.S. Urban Rail Transit Lines Opened From 1980 | website=SEPTA.org | pages = 1-100 | format=pdf | date=November 2011 | accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref>\n\nSEPTA's [[SEPTA Route 15|Route 15]], the [[Girard Avenue]] Line, is another streetcar line that is designated green on route maps but is not part of the subway\u2013surface system.\n\nLike [[Boston]]'s [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] and [[San Francisco]]'s [[Muni Metro]], the SEPTA trolley line is the descendant of a pre-World War II streetcar system. Where Boston and San Francisco's systems use longer, articulated [[light rail|LRT]] vehicles, Philadelphia uses rigid vehicles roughly four inches longer than the [[PCC streetcar]] they somewhat replaced. The lines use [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company|Kawasaki]] K-Car LRVs delivered in 1981-82. The cars are similar to those on [[SEPTA Routes 101 and 102|Routes 101 and 102]], SEPTA's suburban trolley routes, which were delivered around the same time. However, the subway\u2013surface cars are single-ended and use [[trolley pole]]s, while the suburban lines use double ended cars and [[Pantograph (transport)|pantographs]] for power collection.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Center City===\nStarting from their eastern terminus at [[13th Street station (SEPTA)|13th Street Station]] near [[City Hall (Philadelphia)|City Hall]], the trolleys loop around in a tunnel under City Hall before stopping at under [[Dilworth Park]] at [[15th Street station (SEPTA)|15th Street station]] and then realign back under [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]].\n\nAll five routes also stop at [[19th Street (SEPTA station)|19th Street]], [[22nd Street (SEPTA station)|22nd Street]], [[30th Street station (subway)|30th Street]], and [[33rd Street (SEPTA station)|33rd Street]], which are all underground stations. From 15th to 30th Streets, they run in the same tunnel as SEPTA's [[Market\u2013Frankford Line]], which runs express on the inner tracks while the trolleys utilize the outer ones.\n\nPassengers may transfer free of charge to the Market\u2013Frankford Line at 13th, 15th, and 30th Streets, as well as to the [[Broad Street Line]] at 15th Street. Connections to the [[SEPTA Regional Rail|Regional Rail]] are also available via underground passageways connecting 13th and 15th Street stations to [[Suburban Station]], one of the city's main commuter rail terminals.\n\n===University City===\nAfter traveling under the [[Schuylkill River]], the trolley lines provide access to [[30th Street Station]], a passenger terminal located across the street from the trolley and rapid transit station. Connection is available to Regional Rail, many [[Amtrak]] services, and [[New Jersey Transit]]'s [[Atlantic City Line]]. An underground passageway that connects these two stations is currently closed. {{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The closure was due to passenger safety issues after a passenger attack in the 1990s. In 2016, the 30th Street Station District proposed overhauling both 30th Street Station's SEPTA and trolley stations including, by public demand, the reopening the tunnel that connects the two (currently separate) stations, thus ceasing the need for passengers to resurface, walk outside to cross the busy 30th Street, and then enter the other station. The timeline called for the tunnel overhaul to be part of Phase 1 and thus completed by 2020. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://planphilly.com/articles/2016/03/15/30th-street-station-district-draft-plan-reopen-septa-tunnel-by-2020-cap-rail-yards-by-2050|title=30th Street Station District draft plan: Reopen SEPTA tunnel by 2020, cap rail yards by 2050|work=PlanPhilly {{!}} 30th Street Station District draft plan: Reopen SEPTA tunnel by 2020, cap rail yards by 2050|access-date=2018-07-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAll routes then stop at 33rd Street, near Drexel University. After this stop, Route 10 diverts from the others and emerges from the tunnel at the [[36th Street Portal]] just south of Market Street, then turns north onto 36th Street and then northwest along [[Lancaster Avenue]] and other surface streets. The other four lines make underground stops at [[36th Street station (SEPTA)|36th and Sansom streets]] and [[37th Street station (SEPTA)|37th and Spruce streets]] on the campus of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] before surfacing at the [[40th Street Portal]] near [[Baltimore Avenue]], heading southwest on surface streets.\n\n===Points south and west===\n{{expand section|date=February 2018}}\nThe Route 11 line travels along Woodland Avenue in Philadelphia and Main Street in [[Darby, Pennsylvania|Darby]].

At [[Market Street (Philadelphia)|Market Street]], the line connects to the [[Market\u2013Frankford Line]] at its [[40th Street station (SEPTA)|40th Street station]]. The surface tracks continue southbound to [[Spruce Street (Philadelphia)|Spruce Street]], where they splits either eastbound or westbound. Westbound tracks run to 42nd Street where they turn south to either Baltimore Avenue (Route 34), Chester Avenue (Route 13), or Woodland Avenue (Routes 11 and 36).\n\nTracks for the other four routes run northbound along 42nd Street, then turning east onto Spruce Street and then north onto 38th Street ([[U.S. Route 13 in Pennsylvania|US 13]]). From here, it travels to Filbert Street, then turning left and crossing the 40th Street tracks. When Filbert Street terminates at 41st Street, the tracks turn right, and head north until reaching Lancaster Avenue.<ref>[http://www.septa.org/maps/trolley/city.html SEPTA trolley lines map]</ref>\n\nAnother set of diversionary trolley tracks begin near the [[49th Street station (SEPTA Regional Rail)|49th Street Regional Rail station]], connecting Chester Avenue to Woodland Avenue (where Routes 11 and 36 separate) by way of 49th Street.\n\n==History==\n[[File:University of Pennsylvania College Hall.jpg|right|thumb|[[College Hall (University of Pennsylvania)|College Hall]] and Logan Hall on the campus of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], as viewed from Woodland Avenue c. 1892.]]\n[[File:SEPTA Subway-Surface map.png|thumb|Schematic map of subway\u2013surface branches and termini]]\nThe subway\u2013surface lines are remnants of the far more extensive streetcar system that developed in Philadelphia after the arrival of electric trolleys in 1892. Several dozen traction companies were consolidated in 1902 into the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company. The PRT funneled the West Philadelphia lines into subway tunnels as they approached the city center. After the PRT declared bankruptcy in 1939, it was reopened as the [[Philadelphia Transportation Company]] (PTC), which was absorbed into SEPTA in 1968.<ref name=\"route34\">{{cite web| url=http://studio34yoga.com/about-us/our-trolley/ | title=Studio 34's Eponymous Trolley, or, A Short History of Route 34 | accessdate=2008-03-11 }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2006, [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s class of 1956 funded the construction of an innovative portal for one of the eastbound entrances of the [[37th Street station (SEPTA)|37th Street station]]: a replica of a [[Peter Witt streetcar|Peter Witt]] trolley of the kind manufactured by [[J. G. Brill and Company]] from 1923\u201326. Operated by the Philadelphia Transportation Company, these trolleys brought university students to the campus and to [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]] until 1956. Routes 11, 34 and 37 ran through the Penn campus on Woodland Avenue and Locust Streets for nearly 65 years. In 1956, the trolley route was buried to enable the university to unify its campus, with Woodland Avenue and Locust Street becoming pedestrian walkways.\n\n==Routes==\nAll routes terminate at [[15th Street station (SEPTA)|15th Street station]] between 12:30 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. when 13th Street is closed. On Sunday evenings and during unexpected diversions, all routes are diverted to surface streets and terminate at [[40th Street station (SEPTA)|40th Street station]].

Caught between them is real-life British engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], builder of the century's greatest ship, {{SS|Great Eastern}}. Brunel is kidnapped by Nemo to help design a submarine with which to fight the laying of the [[Translatlantic telegraph cable]], which links the two colonialist forces Nemo hates, England and the US. Brunel finds himself going up against his own ship, and the strange man hired to protect it, Captain Ahab.\n\nIn March 2019, the film rights to ''The Great Eastern'' were acquired by the UK film company Great Point Media, and Rodman was commissioned to write the screen adaptation.<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Howard A.
