According to [[Louis Duchesne]], the establishment of a see at Soissons dates from about 300.\n\nThe territory of Soissons and Laon played an important political part under the [[Merovingians]]. After the death of [[Clovis I|Clovis]] (511), Soissons was the capital of one of the four kingdoms into which his states were divided. The [[Kingdom of Soissons]], which ceased to exist in 558, when [[Clotaire I]] reunited all the [[Franks|Frankish]] states, came into being again in 561 when the death of Clotaire led to a redivision of the territory. It finally disappeared in 613 when the Frankish lands were once more reunited under [[Clotaire II]].\n\nIt was re-established by the [[Concordat of 1802]] as suffragan of [[Paris]], but in 1821 it became [[suffragan]] of [[Reims]]. It consists of\n\n*all the ancient Diocese of Soissons, except the civil district of [[Compi\u00e8gne]], which went to the [[Diocese of Beauvais]]\n*all of the [[Diocese of Laon]], except two parishes, which went to [[Reims]]\n*that portion of [[Vermandois]] which formerly belonged to the [[Diocese of Noyon]]\n*a few parishes which formerly belonged to [[Cambrai]], [[Meaux]], [[Troyes]], Reims.\n\n==See of Laon==\n{{main|Ancient diocese of Laon}}\n\n==Bishops of Soissons==\n\nThe Bishop of Soissons as senior suffragan of Reims had the privilege, during a vacancy of the metropolitan see, to replace the archbishop at the ceremony of anointing a King of France.

He was imprisoned from June to August 1793. He returned to parish life, and on 14 December 1799 was elected Constitutional Bishop of Seine-Inf\u00e9rieure (Rouen); he was consecrated bishop on 18 January 1800 by Constitutional Bishop Royer. He submitted his resignation to Cardinal Caprara, the Papal Legate, on 15 October 1801.  On 9 April 1802 he was appointed by arr\u00eat of First Consul Bonaparte to the diocese of Soissons, but on 16 April, at a meeting of several constitutional bishops with Cardinal Caprara, he refused to sign a statement disavowing his past conduct. On 29 June 1804 he wrote to [[Pope Pius VII]] proclaiming his submission and his regrets for the past.  On 5 July 1804 he was named to the Legion of Honor.

[[Hilduin]], abbot (822\u201330), in 826 obtained from [[Pope Eugene II]] relics of [[St. Sebastian]] and [[St. Gregory the Great]]; he caused the relics of [[St. Godard]] and [[St. Remi]] to be transferred to the abbey; he rebuilt the church which was consecrated 27 August 841, in the presence of [[Charles the Bald]] and seventy-two prelates. The king bore the body of St. M\u00e9dard into the new basilica.  In 853 Charles the Bald presided over the Council of Soissons at Saint-Medard, in the company of fifty-one bishops.  Bishop Rothadus of Soissons was deposed, due to the malevolence of Archbishop Hincmar of Reims, but restored on orders of [[Pope Nicholas I]].<ref>Fisquet, pp. 150-154.</ref>\n\nThe church was pulled down but rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1131 by [[Pope Innocent II]], who granted those visiting the church indulgences known as \"St. M\u00e9dard's pardons\". In this abbey [[Louis the Pious]] was imprisoned in 833, and there he underwent a public penance. Among the abbots of St. M\u00e9dard's are: [[St. Arnoul]], who in 1081 became Bishop of Soissons; [[Gerald of Sauve-Majeure|St. Gerard]] (close of the eleventh century); [[Cardinal de Bernis]], made commendatory abbot of St. M\u00e9dard in 1756.\n\nThe Benedictine Abbey of Note Dame de Soissons was founded in 660 by [[Ebroin]] and his wife Leutrude. The Cistercian abbey of [[Longpont]], founded in 1131, counted among its monks the theologian [[Pierre Cantor]], who died in 1197, and Blessed [[John de Montmirail]] (1167\u20131217), who abandoned the court of [[Phillipe-Auguste]] in order to become a monk.\n\nThe abbey of St. Vincent at Laon was founded in 580 by Queen Brunehaut. Among its earlier monks were: St. Gobain, who, through love of solitude, retired to a desert place near Oise and was slain there; St. Chagnoaldus, afterward Bishop of Laon, who wished to die in his monastery; St. Humbert, first abbot of Maroilles in Hainaut. The abbey adopted the rule of St. Benedict. It was reformed in 961 by Blessed Malcaleine, a Scotchman, abbot of St. Michael at Thierache, and in 1643 by the [[Benedictines]] of St. Maur. Among the abbots of St. Vincent were: St. Gerard (close of the eleventh century), who wrote the history of St. Adelard, abbot of Corde; Jean de Nouelles (d. 1396), who wrote a history of the world, and began the cartulary of his monastery. The Abbey of St. John at Laon was founded in 650 by St. Salaberga, who built seven churches there; she was its first abbess; St. Austruda (d. 688) succeeded her. In 1128 the abbey became a Benedictine monastery. The Abbey of Nogent sous Coucy was founded in 1076 by Alb\u00e9ric, Lord of Coucy. Among its abbots were St. Geoffroy (end of the eleventh century) and the historian Guibert de Nogent, who died in 1112 and whose autobiography, \"De Vita Sua\" is one of the most interesting documents of the century. Under the title \"Gesta Dei per Francos\" he wrote an account of the First Crusade.\n\nThe Abbey of Cuissy in the Diocese of Laon was founded in 1116 by Blessed [[Lucas de Roucy]], dean of Laon, and followed the rule of [[Premonstratensians]]. In the Diocese of Soissons, the Premonstratensians had the abbeys: Chartreuve, Valsery, [[Saint-Yved de Braine]], Villers Cotterets, Val Secret, Vauchr\u00e9tien, Lieurestaur\u00e9.\n\nThe portion of the ancient [[Diocese of Noyon]] within the jurisdiction of the present Diocese of Soissons includes the town, St-Quentin (Augusta Vermanduorum) where St-Quentin was martyred under Diocletian. It was the chief town of a diocese until 532, when St. M\u00e9dard, the titular, removed the see to Noyon. Abbott Fulrade built the Church of St-Quentin in the eighth century and Pope Stephan II blessed it (816). From the time of Charles Martel until 771, and again from 844 the abbots of St-Quentin were laymen and counts of Vermandois. The abbey church became the [[Saint-Quentin Basilica]], built from the 12th to 15th centuries. During the Middle Ages a distinct type of religious architecture sprang up in Soissons; Eug\u00e9ne Lef\u00e8vre Pontalis has recently brought out a work dealing with its artistic affiliations. After investigation Canon Bauxin concludes that the cathedral of Laon, as it exists, is not the one consecrated in 1114 and visited by Innocent II in 1132; that was the restored ancient Romanesque building; the present one was built 1150\u20131225. Louyis d'Outremer (936), Robert the Pious (996), and [[Philip I of France|Philip I]] (1059) were anointed in Notre Dame de Laon; in the twelfth century Hermann, Abbot of St. Martin's of Tournai, wrote a volume on the miracles of Notre Dame of Laon. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu of Laon, once known as H\u00f4tellerie Notre Dame, was founded in 1019 by the Laon chapter. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu of Ch\u00e2teau Thierry was founded in 1304 by Jeanne, wife of Philip the Fair.\n\n==Saints==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe following are honoured as connected with the religious history of the diocese: [[St. Marculfus]], Abbot of [[Nanteuil]] (sixth century) in the [[Diocese of Coutances]], whose relics, transferred to [[Corbeny]] in the [[Diocese of Laon]], were visited by the kings of France who, after their anointing at Reims, were wont to go to the tomb of St. Marculfus to cure the [[king's evil]].\n\nAmong the natives of the diocese may be mentioned: [[Petrus Ramus]] (1515\u201372), [[Jean Racine]] (1639\u201399), [[La Fontaine]] (1621\u201395), Dom [[Luc d'Achery]] (1609\u20131685), [[Charlevoix]] (1683\u20131761), [[Camille Desmoulins]] (1760\u20131794).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nBefore the application of the Congregations Law (1901), there were in the Diocese of Soissons [[Jesuits]], [[Trinitarians]], and several teaching congregations of brothers. Some congregations of women had their origin in the diocese: the Nursing and Teaching Sisters of the Child Jesus, with mother-house at Soissons, founded in 1714 by the Madame Brulard de Genlis; the Sisters of Notre Dame de Bon Secours, a nursing and teaching order, founded in 1806, with mother-house at Charly; Sisters of Notre Dame, nursing and teaching order, with mother-house at Saint-Erme, founded in 1820 by the Abb\u00e9 Chr\u00e9tien; the Franciscan [[Religious sister (Catholic)|sisters]] of the Sacred Heart, a nursing order, founded in 1867, with mother-house at St-Quentin; the Servants of the Heart of Jesus, of whom there are two branches, the \"Marys\" who lead a contemplative life, and the \"Marthas\" who nurse the sick; they were founded at Strasburg in 1867, and brought to St-Quentin after the war of 1870\u20131.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Councils of Soissons]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Books==\n===Reference works===\n*{{cite book|last=Gams|first=Pius Bonifatius |title=Series episcoporum Ecclesiae catholicae: quotquot innotuerunt a beato Petro apostolo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=os9DAQAAMAAJ|year=1873|publisher=Typis et Sumptibus Georgii Josephi Manz|location=Ratisbon}} (Use with caution; obsolete)\n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 1|date=1913|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol01eubeuoft}}  (in Latin) \n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 2|date=1914|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol02eubeuoft}} (in Latin) \n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|last2=Gulik|first2=Guilelmus|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 3|date=1923|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol02eubeuoft}} \n*{{cite book|last1=Gauchat|first1=Patritius (Patrice)|title=Hierarchia catholica  IV (1592-1667)|date=1935|publisher=Libraria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol04eubeuoft|accessdate=2016-07-06}} \n*{{cite book|last1=Ritzler|first1=Remigius|last2=Sefrin|first2=Pirminus|title=Hierarchia catholica medii et recentis aevi  V (1667-1730)|date=1952|publisher=Messagero di S.

According to [[Louis Duchesne]], the establishment of a see at Soissons dates from about 300.\n\nThe territory of Soissons and Laon played an important political part under the [[Merovingians]]. After the death of [[Clovis I|Clovis]] (511), Soissons was the capital of one of the four kingdoms into which his states were divided. The [[Kingdom of Soissons]], which ceased to exist in 558, when [[Clotaire I]] reunited all the [[Franks|Frankish]] states, came into being again in 561 when the death of Clotaire led to a redivision of the territory. It finally disappeared in 613 when the Frankish lands were once more reunited under [[Clotaire II]].\n\nIt was re-established by the [[Concordat of 1802]] as suffragan of [[Paris]], but in 1821 it became [[suffragan]] of [[Reims]].

[[Hilduin]], abbot (822\u201330), in 826 obtained from [[Pope Eugene II]] relics of [[St. Sebastian]] and [[St. Gregory the Great]]; he caused the relics of [[St. Godard]] and [[St. Remi]] to be transferred to the abbey; he rebuilt the church which was consecrated 27 August 841, in the presence of [[Charles the Bald]] and seventy-two prelates. The king bore the body of St. M\u00e9dard into the new basilica.  In 853 Charles the Bald presided over the Council of Soissons at Saint-Medard, in the company of fifty-one bishops.  Bishop Rothadus of Soissons was deposed, due to the malevolence of Archbishop Hincmar of Reims, but restored on orders of [[Pope Nicholas I]].<ref>Fisquet, pp. 150-154.</ref>\n\nThe church was pulled down but rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1131 by [[Pope Innocent II]], who granted those visiting the church indulgences known as \"St. M\u00e9dard's pardons\". In this abbey [[Louis the Pious]] was imprisoned in 833, and there he underwent a public penance. Among the abbots of St. M\u00e9dard's are: [[St. Arnoul]], who in 1081 became Bishop of Soissons; [[Gerald of Sauve-Majeure|St. Gerard]] (close of the eleventh century); [[Cardinal de Bernis]], made commendatory abbot of St. M\u00e9dard in 1756.\n\nThe Benedictine Abbey of Note Dame de Soissons was founded in 660 by [[Ebroin]] and his wife Leutrude. The Cistercian abbey of [[Longpont]], founded in 1131, counted among its monks the theologian [[Pierre Cantor]], who died in 1197, and Blessed [[John de Montmirail]] (1167\u20131217), who abandoned the court of [[Phillipe-Auguste]] in order to become a monk.\n\nThe abbey of St. Vincent at Laon was founded in 580 by Queen Brunehaut. Among its earlier monks were: St. Gobain, who, through love of solitude, retired to a desert place near Oise and was slain there; St. Chagnoaldus, afterward Bishop of Laon, who wished to die in his monastery; St. Humbert, first abbot of Maroilles in Hainaut. The abbey adopted the rule of St. Benedict. It was reformed in 961 by Blessed Malcaleine, a Scotchman, abbot of St. Michael at Thierache, and in 1643 by the [[Benedictines]] of St. Maur. Among the abbots of St. Vincent were: St. Gerard (close of the eleventh century), who wrote the history of St. Adelard, abbot of Corde; Jean de Nouelles (d. 1396), who wrote a history of the world, and began the cartulary of his monastery. The Abbey of St. John at Laon was founded in 650 by St. Salaberga, who built seven churches there; she was its first abbess; St. Austruda (d. 688) succeeded her. In 1128 the abbey became a Benedictine monastery. The Abbey of Nogent sous Coucy was founded in 1076 by Alb\u00e9ric, Lord of Coucy. Among its abbots were St. Geoffroy (end of the eleventh century) and the historian Guibert de Nogent, who died in 1112 and whose autobiography, \"De Vita Sua\" is one of the most interesting documents of the century. Under the title \"Gesta Dei per Francos\" he wrote an account of the First Crusade.\n\nThe Abbey of Cuissy in the Diocese of Laon was founded in 1116 by Blessed [[Lucas de Roucy]], dean of Laon, and followed the rule of [[Premonstratensians]]. In the Diocese of Soissons, the Premonstratensians had the abbeys: Chartreuve, Valsery, [[Saint-Yved de Braine]], Villers Cotterets, Val Secret, Vauchr\u00e9tien, Lieurestaur\u00e9.\n\nThe portion of the ancient [[Diocese of Noyon]] within the jurisdiction of the present Diocese of Soissons includes the town, St-Quentin (Augusta Vermanduorum) where St-Quentin was martyred under Diocletian. It was the chief town of a diocese until 532, when St. M\u00e9dard, the titular, removed the see to Noyon. Abbott Fulrade built the Church of St-Quentin in the eighth century and Pope Stephan II blessed it (816). From the time of Charles Martel until 771, and again from 844 the abbots of St-Quentin were laymen and counts of Vermandois. The abbey church became the [[Saint-Quentin Basilica]], built from the 12th to 15th centuries. During the Middle Ages a distinct type of religious architecture sprang up in Soissons; Eug\u00e9ne Lef\u00e8vre Pontalis has recently brought out a work dealing with its artistic affiliations. After investigation Canon Bauxin concludes that the cathedral of Laon, as it exists, is not the one consecrated in 1114 and visited by Innocent II in 1132; that was the restored ancient Romanesque building; the present one was built 1150\u20131225. Louyis d'Outremer (936), Robert the Pious (996), and [[Philip I of France|Philip I]] (1059) were anointed in Notre Dame de Laon; in the twelfth century Hermann, Abbot of St. Martin's of Tournai, wrote a volume on the miracles of Notre Dame of Laon. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu of Laon, once known as H\u00f4tellerie Notre Dame, was founded in 1019 by the Laon chapter. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu of Ch\u00e2teau Thierry was founded in 1304 by Jeanne, wife of Philip the Fair.\n\n==Saints==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nThe following are honoured as connected with the religious history of the diocese: [[St. Marculfus]], Abbot of [[Nanteuil]] (sixth century) in the [[Diocese of Coutances]], whose relics, transferred to [[Corbeny]] in the [[Diocese of Laon]], were visited by the kings of France who, after their anointing at Reims, were wont to go to the tomb of St. Marculfus to cure the [[king's evil]].\n\nAmong the natives of the diocese may be mentioned: [[Petrus Ramus]] (1515\u201372), [[Jean Racine]] (1639\u201399), [[La Fontaine]] (1621\u201395), Dom [[Luc d'Achery]] (1609\u20131685), [[Charlevoix]] (1683\u20131761), [[Camille Desmoulins]] (1760\u20131794).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nBefore the application of the Congregations Law (1901), there were in the Diocese of Soissons Jesuits, Trinitarians, and several teaching congregations of brothers. Some congregations of women had their origin in the diocese: the Nursing and Teaching Sisters of the Child Jesus, with mother-house at Soissons, founded in 1714 by the Madame Brulard de Genlis; the Sisters of Notre Dame de Bon Secours, a nursing and teaching order, founded in 1806, with mother-house at Charly; Sisters of Notre Dame, nursing and teaching order, with mother-house at Saint-Erme, founded in 1820 by the Abb\u00e9 Chr\u00e9tien; the Franciscan nuns of the Sacred Heart, a nursing order, founded in 1867, with mother-house at St-Quentin; the Servants of the Heart of Jesus, of whom there are two branches, the \"Marys\" who lead a contemplative life, and the \"Marthas\" who nurse the sick; they were founded at Strasburg in 1867, and brought to St-Quentin after the war of 1870\u20131.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Councils of Soissons]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Books==\n===Reference works===\n*{{cite book|last=Gams|first=Pius Bonifatius |title=Series episcoporum Ecclesiae catholicae: quotquot innotuerunt a beato Petro apostolo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=os9DAQAAMAAJ|year=1873|publisher=Typis et Sumptibus Georgii Josephi Manz|location=Ratisbon}} (Use with caution; obsolete)\n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 1|date=1913|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol01eubeuoft}}  (in Latin) \n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 2|date=1914|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol02eubeuoft}} (in Latin) \n*{{cite book|last1=Eubel|first1=Conradus (ed.)|last2=Gulik|first2=Guilelmus|title=Hierarchia catholica, Tomus 3|date=1923|publisher=Libreria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|edition=second|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol02eubeuoft}} \n*{{cite book|last1=Gauchat|first1=Patritius (Patrice)|title=Hierarchia catholica  IV (1592-1667)|date=1935|publisher=Libraria Regensbergiana|location=M\u00fcnster|url=https://archive.org/details/hierarchiacathol04eubeuoft|accessdate=2016-07-06}} \n*{{cite book|last1=Ritzler|first1=Remigius|last2=Sefrin|first2=Pirminus|title=Hierarchia catholica medii et recentis aevi  V (1667-1730)|date=1952|publisher=Messagero di S.

Over time, the newspaper's coverage expanded further into [[political economy]] and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics. Throughout the mid- to late- 20th century, it greatly expanded its layout and format, adding [[Op-ed|opinion columns]], special reports, [[Political cartoon|political cartoons]], [[Letter to the editor|reader letters]], cover stories, art critique, book reviews, and technology features. The paper is often recognizable by its [[fire engine red|fire-engine-red]] nameplate and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with [[Byline|no byline]], in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. The paper is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, ''[[1843 (magazine)|1843]]'', and a variety of podcasts, films, and books.\n\nThe [[The Economist editorial stance|editorial stance of ''The Economist'']] primarily revolves around [[classical liberalism|classical]], [[Social liberalism|social]], and most notably, [[economic liberalism]].

The newspaper advocates for [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal economics]], particularly [[Free market|free markets]], [[free trade]], [[free immigration]] and [[Globalization|globalisation]].

The top four teams in the new conference qualify for the conference playoffs.\n\nOnly three teams in the Mid-Atlantic Conference qualify for the conference playoffs instead of four teams as in 2017. The top team gets a bye to the conference final.\n\nWith the number of conferences in the Northeast Region reduced from four to three, a wildcard team qualifies for the region semifinals. The wildcard team is the conference final loser with the best regular-season record.\n\nThe East and West Divisions of the Southeast Conference are eliminated, and conference playoff qualification is determined on the basis of conference standings.\n\nThe Lone Star Conference is divided into groups: Red, White and Blue. Teams play the other members of their group twice and other conference members only once. Lone Star Conference playoff qualification is based on standings in the group, not the conference. The top two group winners receive the first and second seeds and a bye to the conference semifinals. The remaining group winner receives the third seed and plays in the conference quarterfinals along with each group's second-place team.\n\nNorthwest Conference teams play each other three times instead of two.\n\nFollowing the expansion of the Golden Gate Conference, members play each other twice instead of three times.\n\nSouth Region Semifinal matchups are predetermined based on pairings of specific conferences and not based on region seeding. The Southeast Conference champion plays the Sunshine Conference champion, and the Lone Star Conference champion plays the Heartland Conference champion. Hone-field advantage for the region semifinals is based on region seeding.\n\nThe Golden Gate Conference receives an additional berth to the West Region playoffs, and the region wildcard berth is eliminated. The Southwest Conference continues to have three berths in the West Region playoffs, but the conference's third seed is determined by a play-in game between the third- and fourth-place teams. West Region Quarterfinal matchups are predetermined based on placing within the conference and not based on region seeding. West Region teams are seeded and bracketed for the semifinals.\n\n[[GBFC Thunder|Greater Binghamton FC Thunder]] moved from the Keystone Conference in the Northeast Region to the East Conference in the Midwest Region. The move puts the Thunder in the same conference as three other [[New York state]] teams: [[FC Buffalo]], the [[Rochester Lancers]] and [[Syracuse FC]]. The other four New York state NPSL teams, the [[Brooklyn Italians]], [[Kingston Stockade FC]], [[New York Athletic Club S.C.|New York Athletic Club]] and the [[New York Cosmos B]], all play in the new North Atlantic Conference in the Northeast Region.\n\n==Teams==\nEighteen new clubs joined the NPSL for the 2018 season, including one that returned from a one-year hiatus, and 16 teams departed.

First, [[Jacksonville Armada FC]] owner Robert Palmer announced that the team would compete in the NPSL in 2018, replacing the club's reserve side, [[Jacksonville Armada U-23]]. Palmer said the roster would include five or six players from the NASL squad and that the players would be using the NPSL games as a preseason training opportunity until the then expected start of the NASL season in August.<ref name=jaxu23 />\n\nThe following day, [[Miami FC]] CEO Sean Flynn announced the formation of a reserve squad, Miami FC 2, which entered the NPSL as an expansion team. Flynn said that he created Miami FC 2 to provide Miami FC's players with live match action instead of being confined to training as they waited for the start of the NASL season.<ref name=mi2expand />\n\nOn February 27, 2018, the NASL announced that it had cancelled its 2018 season; it also announced that three of its teams, Miami FC, Jacksonville Armada FC and the [[New York Cosmos (2010)|New York Cosmos]] would be fielding teams in NPSL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasl.com/news/2018/02/27/north-american-soccer-league-announces-cancellation-of-2018-season|title=North American Soccer League Announces Cancellation of 2018 Season|date=February 27, 2018|website=[[North American Soccer League]]|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, [[Carlos Mendes]] was hired as head coach of the [[New York Cosmos B]], the organization's reserve side, which had competed in the NPSL since 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npsl.com/news/4273|title=Carlos Mendes Named Head Coach of New York Cosmos B|date=March 9, 2018|website=[[National Premier Soccer League]]|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}</ref> Within days the Cosmos B signed [[Danny Szetela]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npsl.com/news/4262|title=Szetela Signs Contract Extension|date=March 12, 2018|website=[[National Premier Soccer League]]|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}</ref> [[Chris Wingert]], [[Bljedi Bardic]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nycosmos.com/news/2018/03/15/cosmos-b-announce-additions-to-2018-roster|title=Cosmos B Announce Additions to 2018 Roster|date=March 15, 2018|website=[[New York Cosmos (2010)|New York Cosmos]]|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}</ref> [[Jonathan Borrajo]], [[Alexis Velela]] and [[Wojciech Wojcik]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npsl.com/news/4192|title=Cosmos B Add Three Players|date=March 19, 2018|website=[[National Premier Soccer League]]|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Other developments===\n[[Virginia Beach City FC]] and [[D.C.

However, the USSF informed the three NASL clubs playing (either directly or through a reserve team) in the NPSL in 2018, that they were not eligible to participate in the tournament, since NPSL teams qualify based on the previous season's results. Neither the New York Cosmos B nor the Jacksonville Armada U-23 were ranked highly enough by the NPSL to qualify, and Miami FC 2 was new to the league. The three clubs appealed this ruling, requesting berths in the tournament. The USSF ultimately reversed its decision and allowed the three teams to participate, bringing the total number of NPSL teams in the tournament to 22.<ref>{{cite news |last=Carlisle |first=Jeff |date=March 30, 2018 |title=NASL Holdovers Cosmos, Miami FC, Armada Cleared for U.S. Open Cup |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/us-open-cup/story/3436475/nasl-holdovers-new-york-cosmos-miami-fc-and-jacksonville-armada-cleared-for-us-open-cup |website=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=August 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA play-in round was added to the U.S. Open Cup for the New York Cosmos B, the Jacksonville Armada FC and Miami FC 2.

In the Midwest and West Regions, conference champions are determined by regular-season standings. The playoff qualification and format rules vary among regions and conferences. Once teams reach the regional playoffs, either by their performance in their conference tournament, their regular-season results or, in the case of the Northeast Region wildcard team, a combination of the two, all matches are knockout matches. The four regional champions advance to the national semifinals and are seeded based on regular-season average points per game. Regular-season average goal difference per game is the first tiebreaker used to determine seeding, if needed. Regular-season average goals scored per game is the second tiebreaker. If the tie is still not broken, a coin toss determines seeding. The #1 seed plays the #4 seed in one national semifinal, and the #2 seed plays the #3 seed in the other national semifinal on July 28. Semifinal winners advance to the NPSL Championship Match on August 4. Home-field advantage in national semifinal and final matches is awarded to the highest seed.\n===Northeast Region Playoffs===\nFour teams qualify for the Northeast Region Semifinals. These are the three winners of the conference championship playoffs and the conference finals loser with the best regular-season average points per game. The four semifinalists are seeded based on regular-season points per game. The three conference champions are not automatically awarded the highest seed; the wildcard team could be the top seed. The #1 seed plays the #4 seed in one regional semifinal. The #2 seed plays the #3 seed in the other regional semifinal. Semifinal winners advance to the Northeast Region Championship Match. Home-field advantage in a regional playoff match is awarded to the highest seed.\n====Keystone Conference Playoffs====\nThe top four teams qualify based on conference standings. The #1 seed plays the #4 seed in one conference semifinal. The #2 seed plays the #3 seed in the other conference semifinal. Semifinal winners meet in the Keystone Conference Championship Match.

Home-field advantage in conference playoff matches is awarded to the highest seed.\n====North Atlantic Conference Playoffs====\nThe top four teams qualify based on conference standings. The #1 seed plays the #4 seed in one conference semifinal. The #2 seed plays the #3 seed in the other conference semifinal. Semifinal winners meet in the North Atlantic Conference Championship Match. Home-field advantage in conference playoff matches is awarded to the highest seed.\n\n===South Region Playoffs===\nThe four conference playoff champions qualify for the South Region Semifinals. Teams are seeded based on regular-season average points per game for hosting purposes, but the semifinal matchups are fixed with the Heartland and Lone Star Conference champions meeting in one semifinal, and the Southeast and Sunshine Conference champions matched up in the other semifinal. Semifinal winners advance to the South Region Championship Match.\n====Southeast Conference Playoffs====\nThe top six teams qualify based on conference standings. The top two teams receive byes to the conference semifinals. The #3 seed plays the #6 seed, and the #4 seed plays the #5 seed in conference quarterfinal matches. The #1 seed plays lowest seeded quarterfinal winner in one semifinal match; the #2 seed plays higher seeded quarterfinal winner in the other semifinal match. Semifinal winners meet in the Southeast Conference Championship Match. Home-field advantage in conference playoff matches is awarded to the highest seed.\n\n====Sunshine Conference Playoffs====\nThe top three teams qualify based on conference standings. The #2 seed plays the #3 seed in a semifinal match, and the winner plays the #1 seed in the Sunshine Conference Championship Match. Home-field advantage in conference playoff matches is awarded to the highest seed.\n====Lone Star Conference Playoffs====\nThe conference is split into three groups: Red, White and Blue. The top two teams from each group receive playoff berths. The three teams that finish first in their groups are awarded the top three seeds based on conference standings. The three teams that finish second in their groups are awarded the fourth through sixth seeds based on conference standings. The top two seeds receive byes to the conference semifinals. The #3 seed plays the #6 seed, and the #4 seed plays the #5 seed in conference quarterfinal matches. The #1 seed plays the lowest seeded quarterfinal winner in one semifinal match; the #2 seed plays higher seeded quarterfinal winner in the other semifinal match. Semifinal winners meet in the Lone Star Conference Championship Match. Home-field advantage in conference playoff matches is awarded to the highest seed.\n\n====Heartland Conference Playoffs====\nThe top four teams qualify based on conference standings.

Home-field advantage in conference playoff matches is awarded to the highest seed.\n\n===Midwest Region Playoffs===\nConference champions are determined based on the regular-season conference standings. The top two teams from each conference qualify for the region playoffs based on conference standings. The three conference champions are awarded the top three seeds. The three teams that finish second in their conferences are awarded the fourth through sixth seeds. The top two seeds receive byes to the region semifinals. The #3 seed hosts a region quarterfinal match against the team seeded 4 through 6 that is geographically closest to it. The remaining two lower seeds play each other with the higher seed hosting. The #1 seed plays the lowest seeded quarterfinal winner in one semifinal match; the #2 seed plays higher seeded quarterfinal winner in the other semifinal match. Semifinal winners meet in the Midwest Region Championship Match. The semifinals and final are held at one venue voted upon by Midwest Region club owners; designation of home teams is determined by the highest seed in each match.

The national semifinal loser from the region with the larger number of teams is ranked third, and the remaining national semifinalist is ranked fourth. The four regional final losers are ranked fifth through eighth based on the number of teams in their region, from largest to smallest. The remaining 22 slots in the rankings are allocated among the regions based on their sizes. The total number of slots allocated to each region are South 9, Northeast 8, Midwest 7 and West 6. Since the [[United States Soccer Federation]] has not yet determined how many berths NPSL clubs will be awarded in the U.S. Open Cup, each of the 22 slots available in the rankings for teams that did not reach the region finals are each allocated to a specific region. This ensures that, regardless of the number of berths awarded to NPSL clubs, the berths will have been allocated as fairly as possible, taking into account the relative sizes of the regions. The allocation of the ninth through 30th slots for this season is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

The NPSL has elected to use results of the 2018 league season to determine which NPSL clubs [[2019 U.S. Open Cup qualification|qualify]] for the 2019 [[U.S. Open Cup]].

The top four teams in the new conference qualify for the conference playoffs.\n\nOnly three teams in the Mid-Atlantic Conference qualify for the conference playoffs instead of four teams as in 2017. The top team gets a bye to the conference final.\n\nWith the number of conferences in the Northeast Region reduced from four to three, a wildcard team qualifies for the region semifinals. The wildcard team is the conference final loser with the best regular-season record.\n\nThe East and West Divisions of the Southeast Conference are eliminated, and conference playoff qualification is determined on the basis of conference standings.\n\nThe Lone Star Conference is divided into groups: Red, White and Blue. Teams play the other members of their group twice and other conference members only once. Lone Star Conference playoff qualification is based on standings in the group, not the conference. The top two group winners receive the first and second seeds and a bye to the conference semifinals. The remaining group winner receives the third seed and plays in the conference quarterfinals along with each group's second-place team.\n\nNorthwest Conference teams play each other three times instead of two.\n\nFollowing the expansion of the Golden Gate Conference, members play each other twice instead of three times.\n\nSouth Region Semifinal matchups are predetermined based on pairings of specific conferences and not based on region seeding. The Southeast Conference champion plays the Sunshine Conference champion, and the Lone Star Conference champion plays the Heartland Conference champion. Hone-field advantage for the region semifinals is based on region seeding.\n\nThe Golden Gate Conference receives an additional berth to the West Region playoffs, and the region wildcard berth is eliminated. The Southwest Conference continues to have three berths in the West Region playoffs, but the conference's third seed is determined by a play-in game between the third- and fourth-place teams. West Region Quarterfinal matchups are predetermined based on placing within the conference and not based on region seeding. West Region teams are seeded and bracketed for the semifinals.\n\n[[GBFC Thunder|Greater Binghamton FC Thunder]] moved from the Keystone Conference in the Northeast Region to the East Conference in the Midwest Region. The move puts the Thunder in the same conference as three other [[New York state]] teams: [[FC Buffalo]], the [[Rochester Lancers]] and [[Syracuse FC]]. The other four New York state NPSL teams, the [[Brooklyn Italians]], [[Kingston Stockade FC]], [[New York Athletic Club S.C.|New York Athletic Club]] and the [[New York Cosmos B]], all play in the new North Atlantic Conference in the Northeast Region.\n\n==Teams==\nEighteen new clubs joined the NPSL for the 2018 season, including one that returned from a one-year hiatus, and 16 teams departed.

However, the USSF informed the three NASL clubs playing (either directly or through a reserve team) in the NPSL in 2018, that they were not eligible to participate in the tournament, since NPSL teams qualify based on the previous season's results. Neither the New York Cosmos B nor the Jacksonville Armada U-23 were ranked highly enough by the NPSL to qualify, and Miami FC 2 was new to the league. The three clubs appealed this ruling, requesting berths in the tournament. The USSF ultimately reversed its decision and allowed the three teams to participate, bringing the total number of NPSL teams in the tournament to 22.<ref>{{cite news |last=Carlisle |first=Jeff |date=March 30, 2018 |title=NASL Holdovers Cosmos, Miami FC, Armada Cleared for U.S. Open Cup |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/us-open-cup/story/3436475/nasl-holdovers-new-york-cosmos-miami-fc-and-jacksonville-armada-cleared-for-us-open-cup |website=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=August 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA play-in round was added to the U.S. Open Cup for the New York Cosmos B, the Jacksonville Armada FC and Miami FC 2.

In the Midwest and West Regions, conference champions are determined by regular-season standings. The playoff qualification and format rules vary among regions and conferences. Once teams reach the regional playoffs, either by their performance in their conference tournament, their regular-season results or, in the case of the Northeast Region wildcard team, a combination of the two, all matches are knockout matches. The four regional champions advance to the national semifinals and are seeded based on regular-season average points per game. Regular-season average goal difference per game is the first tiebreaker used to determine seeding, if needed. Regular-season average goals scored per game is the second tiebreaker. If the tie is still not broken, a coin toss determines seeding. The #1 seed plays the #4 seed in one national semifinal, and the #2 seed plays the #3 seed in the other national semifinal on July 28.

The national semifinal loser from the region with the larger number of teams is ranked third, and the remaining national semifinalist is ranked fourth. The four regional final losers are ranked fifth through eighth based on the number of teams in their region, from largest to smallest. The remaining 22 slots in the rankings are allocated among the regions based on their sizes. The total number of slots allocated to each region are South 9, Northeast 8, Midwest 7 and West 6. Since the [[United States Soccer Federation]] has not yet determined how many berths NPSL clubs will be awarded in the U.S. Open Cup, each of the 22 slots available in the rankings for teams that did not reach the region finals are each allocated to a specific region. This ensures that, regardless of the number of berths awarded to NPSL clubs, the berths will have been allocated as fairly as possible, taking into account the relative sizes of the regions. The allocation of the ninth through 30th slots for this season is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

It served in North Africa and Italy in the  [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] and France and Germany in the [[European Theater of Operations|European theater]] between 1942 and 1945.\n\nOriginally the [[I Armored Corps (United States)|I Armored Corps]] under command of Lieutenant General [[George S. Patton]], it made landfall at Morocco during [[Operation Torch]] as the [[Western Task Force]], the first all-U.S. force to enter the European war. Following successful defeat of the [[Wehrmacht]] under General [[Erwin Rommel]] in North Africa, the I Armored Corps was redesignated the Seventh Army on 10 July 1943 while at sea en route to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of [[Sicily]] as the spearhead of Operation Husky.\n\nAfter the conquests of [[Palermo]] and [[Messina]] the Seventh Army prepared for the invasion of France by its Mediterranean coast as the lead element of [[Operation Dragoon]] in August 1944. It then drove a retreating German army north and then west toward the [[Alsace]], being absorbed into the newly created [[Sixth United States Army Group]] in mid-September. In January 1945 it repelled a fierce but brief enemy counter-offensive  during the German [[Operation Nordwind]], then completed its reduction of the region by mid-March.\n\nIn a lead role in [[Operation Undertone]] launched March 15, the Seventh Army fought its way across the [[Rhine]] into Germany, capturing [[Nuremberg]] and then [[Munich]]. Elements reached Austria and crossed the [[Brenner Pass]] into Italy by May 4, followed shortly by war's end on [[VE-Day]], May 8, 1945.<ref name=Alps>Fifth Army History \u2022 Race to the Alps, Chapter VI : Conclusion [http://www.milhist.net/mto/racealps.html] \"On 3 May the 85th and 88th [Infantry] Divisions sent task forces north over ice and snow 3 feet deep to seal the Austrian frontier and to gain contact with the American Seventh Army, driving southward from Germany.

This was followed four days later by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|declaration of war on the United States]]. By November 8, 1942, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[George S. Patton|George S. Patton Jr.]] was commanding the [[Western Task Force]], the only all-American force landing for [[Operation Torch]], codename for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of [[French North Africa]]. After succeeding there, Patton, now promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]], commanded the Seventh Army, which was formed at midnight on 10 July 1943 by the redesignation of the [[I Armored Corps (United States)|I Armored Corps]], during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943 in conjunction with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], commanded by [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]], Patton's rival. Patton was to command the Seventh Army until early 1944.\n\nThe Seventh Army landed on several beaches in southern Sicily on 10 July 1943 and captured the Sicilian capital of [[Palermo]] on 22 July and, along with the British Eighth Army, captured [[Messina]] on 16 August. During the fighting, the elements of the Seventh Army killed or captured thousands of enemy soldiers, mainly Italians. During the operation the Seventh and Eighth Armies came under the command of the [[15th Army Group]], under General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]]. The headquarters of the Seventh Army remained relatively inactive at Palermo, Sicily, and [[Algiers]] until January 1944, when Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]], then commanding the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] on the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Front]], was assigned as commander and the Seventh Army began planning for the [[Operation Dragoon|invasion of southern France]].\n\nThe invasion was originally given the code name of \"Operation Anvil\", but was changed to \"[[Operation Dragoon]]\" before the landing. In March 1944, Major General [[Alexander Patch]], a highly experienced and competent commander, was assigned to command the Seventh Army, which moved to [[Naples]], [[Italy]], the following July. On 15 August 1944, elements of the Seventh Army assaulted the beaches of [[southern France]] in the [[St. Tropez]] and [[Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, Var|St. Raphael]] area. (Patch was promoted to Lieutenant General three days later.)  On September 15, the Seventh was put under the field control of the [[Sixth United States Army Group|6th Army Group]], under Lieutenant General [[Jacob L. Devers]]. The 6th Army Group also included the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]]. Within one month, the Seventh Army, which by then employed three American [[Division (military)|divisions]], five French divisions and the [[1st Airborne Task Force (Allied)|1st Airborne Task Force]], had advanced 400 miles and joined with the Allied forces [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|coming south from Normandy]]. In the process, the Seventh Army had liberated [[Marseilles]], [[Lyon]], [[Toulon]] and all of Southern France.\n\nThe Seventh Army then assaulted the German forces in the [[Vosges Mountains]] and broke into the [[Alsatian Plain]]. During the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in late December, it extended its flanks to take over much of the area that had been the responsibility of [[United States Army Central|U.S. Third Army]], then commanded by Patton who had previously commanded the Seventh, which allowed the Third to relieve surrounded American forces [[siege of Bastogne|besieged at Bastogne]]. In mid-January 1945, the Seventh engaged in pitched battle seeking to regain ground lost to Germany's [[Operation Nordwind]] New Year's offensive. Along with the French First Army, the Seventh went on the offensive in February 1945 and eliminated the [[Colmar Pocket]]. After capturing the city of [[Strasbourg]], the Seventh went into the [[Saarland|Saar]], assaulted the [[Siegfried Line]], and reached the [[Rhine|River Rhine]] during the first week of March, 1945.\n\nIn a lead role in [[Operation Undertone]], the Seventh Army fought its way across the Rhine into Germany, captured [[Nuremberg]] and then [[Munich]]. Finally it crossed the [[Brenner Pass]] and made contact with Lieutenant General [[Lucian Truscott]]'s U.S. Fifth Army at [[Vipiteno]]<ref name=Alps/> \u2013 once again on Italian soil.\n\nIn less than nine months of continuous fighting, the Seventh Army had advanced over 1,000 miles and for varying times had commanded 24 U.S. and Allied divisions, including the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd]], [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th]], [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd]], [[44th Infantry Division (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th]], [[63rd Infantry Division (United States)|63rd]], [[70th Infantry Division (United States)|70th]], [[100th Infantry Division (United States)|100th]], and [[103rd Infantry Division (United States)|103rd Infantry Divisions]].\n\n===Cold War===\n{{ external media | align = center |audio1 = You may listen members of the [[Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra]] broadcasting on the radio in Europe from 1956\u20132006 [https://www.7aso.org/htmldocs/asaudiop.html  '''here on 7aso.org''']}}\nThe Seventh Army was inactivated in March 1946, in Germany, reactivated for a short time at [[Atlanta, Georgia]], then inactivated again.

It served in North Africa and Italy in the  [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations]] and France and Germany in the [[European Theater of Operations|European theater]] between 1942 and 1945.\n\nOriginally the [[I Armored Corps (United States)|I Armored Corps]] under command of Lieutenant General [[George S. Patton]], it made landfall at Morocco during [[Operation Torch]] as the [[Western Task Force]], the first all-U.S. force to enter the European war. Following successful defeat of the [[Wehrmacht]] under General [[Erwin Rommel]] in North Africa, the I Armored Corps was redesignated the Seventh Army on 10 July 1943 while at sea en route to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of [[Sicily]] as the spearhead of Operation Husky.\n\nAfter the conquests of [[Palermo]] and [[Messina]] the Seventh Army prepared for the invasion of France by its Mediterranean coast as the lead element of [[Operation Dragoon]] in August 1944. It then drove a retreating German army north and then west toward the [[Alsace]], being absorbed into the newly created [[Sixth United States Army Group]] in mid-September. In January 1945 it repelled a fierce but brief enemy counter-offensive  during the German [[Operation Nordwind]], then completed its reduction of the region by mid-March.\n\nIn a lead role in [[Operation Undertone]] launched March 15, the Seventh Army fought its way across the [[Rhine]] into Germany, capturing [[Nuremberg]] and then [[Munich]]. Elements reached Austria and crossed the [[Brenner Pass]] into Italy by May 4, followed shortly by war's end on [[VE-Day]], May 8, 1945.<ref name=Alps>Fifth Army History \u2022 Race to the Alps, Chapter VI : Conclusion [http://www.milhist.net/mto/racealps.html] \"On 3 May the 85th and 88th [Infantry] Divisions sent task forces north over ice and snow 3 feet deep to seal the Austrian frontier and to gain contact with the American Seventh Army, driving southward from Germany.

This was followed four days later by the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[German declaration of war against the United States (1941)|declaration of war on the United States]]. By November 8, 1942, [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[George S. Patton|George S. Patton Jr.]] was commanding the [[Western Task Force]], the only all-American force landing for [[Operation Torch]], codename for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] invasion of [[French North Africa]]. After succeeding there, Patton, now promoted to the rank of [[Lieutenant General (United States)|Lieutenant General]], commanded the Seventh Army, which was formed at midnight on 10 July 1943 by the redesignation of the [[I Armored Corps (United States)|I Armored Corps]], during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943 in conjunction with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], commanded by [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]], Patton's rival. Patton was to command the Seventh Army until early 1944.\n\nThe Seventh Army landed on several beaches in southern Sicily on 10 July 1943 and captured the Sicilian capital of [[Palermo]] on 22 July and, along with the British Eighth Army, captured [[Messina]] on 16 August. During the fighting, the elements of the Seventh Army killed or captured thousands of enemy soldiers, mainly Italians. During the operation the Seventh and Eighth Armies came under the command of the [[15th Army Group]], under General [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]]. The headquarters of the Seventh Army remained relatively inactive at Palermo, Sicily, and [[Algiers]] until January 1944, when Lieutenant General [[Mark W. Clark]], then commanding the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]] on the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Front]], was assigned as commander and the Seventh Army began planning for the [[Operation Dragoon|invasion of southern France]].\n\nThe invasion was originally given the code name of \"Operation Anvil\", but was changed to \"[[Operation Dragoon]]\" before the landing. In March 1944, Major General [[Alexander Patch]], a highly experienced and competent commander, was assigned to command the Seventh Army, which moved to [[Naples]], [[Italy]], the following July. On 15 August 1944, elements of the Seventh Army assaulted the beaches of [[southern France]] in the [[St. Tropez]] and [[Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, Var|St. Raphael]] area. (Patch was promoted to Lieutenant General three days later.)  On September 15, the Seventh was put under the field control of the [[Sixth United States Army Group|6th Army Group]], under Lieutenant General [[Jacob L. Devers]]. The 6th Army Group also included the [[First Army (France)|French First Army]]. Within one month, the Seventh Army, which by then employed three American [[Division (military)|divisions]], five French divisions and the [[1st Airborne Task Force (Allied)|1st Airborne Task Force]], had advanced 400 miles and joined with the Allied forces [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|coming south from Normandy]]. In the process, the Seventh Army had liberated [[Marseilles]], [[Lyon]], [[Toulon]] and all of Southern France.\n\nThe Seventh Army then assaulted the German forces in the [[Vosges Mountains]] and broke into the [[Alsatian Plain]]. During the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in late December, it extended its flanks to take over much of the area that had been the responsibility of [[United States Army Central|U.S. Third Army]], then commanded by Patton who had previously commanded the Seventh, which allowed the Third to relieve surrounded American forces [[siege of Bastogne|besieged at Bastogne]]. In mid-January 1945, the Seventh engaged in pitched battle seeking to regain ground lost to Germany's [[Operation Nordwind]] New Year's offensive. Along with the French First Army, the Seventh went on the offensive in February 1945 and eliminated the [[Colmar Pocket]]. After capturing the city of [[Strasbourg]], the Seventh went into the [[Saarland|Saar]], assaulted the [[Siegfried Line]], and reached the [[Rhine|River Rhine]] during the first week of March, 1945.\n\nIn a lead role in [[Operation Undertone]], the Seventh Army fought its way across the Rhine into Germany, captured [[Nuremberg]] and then [[Munich]]. Finally it crossed the [[Brenner Pass]] and made contact with Lieutenant General [[Lucian Truscott]]'s U.S. Fifth Army at [[Vipiteno]]<ref name=Alps/> \u2013 once again on Italian soil.\n\nIn less than nine months of continuous fighting, the Seventh Army had advanced over 1,000 miles and for varying times had commanded 24 U.S. and Allied divisions, including the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd]], [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th]], [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd]], [[44th Infantry Division (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th]], [[63rd Infantry Division (United States)|63rd]], [[70th Infantry Division (United States)|70th]], [[100th Infantry Division (United States)|100th]], and [[103rd Infantry Division (United States)|103rd Infantry Divisions]].\n\n===Cold War===\n{{ external media | align = center |audio1 = You may listen members of the [[Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra]] broadcasting on the radio in Europe from 1956\u20132006 [https://www.7aso.org/htmldocs/asaudiop.html  '''here on 7aso.org''']}}\nThe Seventh Army was inactivated in March 1946, in Germany, reactivated for a short time at [[Atlanta, Georgia]], then inactivated again.

{"title_page": "Canada\u2013Latin America relations", "text_new": "[[File:Canada (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Map of [[Canada]]]]\n[[File:Latin America (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|Map of [[Latin America]]]]\n\n'''Canada\u2013Latin America relations''' are relations between [[Canada]] and the countries of [[Latin America]]. This includes the bilateral ties between Canada and the individual Latin American states, [[plurilateral]] ties between Canada and any group of those states, or multilateral relations through groups like the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS).\n\nCanada and Latin America share ties of geography as part of the [[Western Hemisphere]] and history through the shared experience of [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]]. Culturally, Canada shares with the other societies in the Americas a mixture of European, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]], and immigrant influences. For both Canadians and Latin Americans, the importance of [[Foreign relations of the United States|relations with the United States]] may overshadow relations with each other. However Canada's importance in the region has risen since joining the OAS in 1990.\n\n==Historical relations to 1968==\nIn the decades following [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867, [[Canada]] had limited political involvement, but after 1898 had significant economic ties in the Caribbean, Mexico and Brazil and Canadians went as businessmen and missionaries to a number of other countries.<ref>J.C.M. Ogelsby, Gringos from the Far North, Essays in the History of Canadian-Latin American Relations, 1866-1968. Macmillan 1976.</ref> As Canadian foreign policy was largely constrained by Canada's ties to the British Empire, political and economic relations remained tethered and controlled. Even after Canada gained political autonomy in foreign relations with the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] (1931) relations with [[Latin America]] remained weak due to domestic economic turmoil.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 11-12.</ref>\n\nFollowing increased solidarity between regions in Latin America throughout the 1800s came the birth of the [[Pan-American Union]] in 1910. Between 1909 and 1941 Latin American states ([[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]] and others) repeatedly appealed for Canadian involvement in union. In accordance with the [[Monroe Doctrine]] the United States actively opposed Canadian involvement as Canada's foreign relations were subject to the interests of a European power, [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Nevertheless, Canada remained outside of the union for reasons of economic disinterest.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 11-12. + McKenna, Peter. \"Canada and the OAS\". (Ottawa: Carlton University Press, 1995) 66-67.</ref>\n\nBy the early 1940s, Canada had become a relatively important industrial producer that was in desperate need of integration in additional foreign markets. Devastation in Europe due to World War II made Latin America a logical alternative. Unfortunately for Canadian interests, the period following the [[Second World War]] marked an important shift in the world political and economic order that saw the growth and spread of [[communism]].\n\nThe onset of the [[Cold War]] had important implications for Canadian foreign policy. Significantly, Canadian officials saw Latin America as a region particularly vulnerable to the spread of communism because of vast underdevelopment and socio-economic disparities.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 31.</ref> More importantly for Canada, however, was the immense propagation of American economic and political dominance and [[Americanization]] throughout the world. While Canada, like the [[United States]] during the early cold war years, could be viewed as a liberal-democracy devoted to the spread of [[capitalism]] and free market ideals, the Canadian form of the ideology was inherently more accepting of socialist facets. Effectively, Canada grew closer to many Latin American states and often acted as a mediator between the United States and Latin America.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 47.</ref>\n\n==Trudeau years 1968\u20131984==\n[[File:Heads of State Cancun Summit 1981.jpg|thumb|right|Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau attending the [[North\u2013South Summit]] along with his Mexican counterpart, President [[Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo]] in [[Canc\u00fan]], Mexico; October 1981.]]\nThe early years of [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s time in office as [[Prime Minister of Canada]] marked an important shift in Canada's role in international politics. During this time Canada, under Trudeau's realist and pragmatist ideals, began to view relations with previously untapped global regions such as Latin America as vital to Canada's future political and economic interests. Trudeau illuminates these ideas:\n\"We have to take greater account of the ties which bind us to other nations in this hemisphere \u2013 in the Caribbean, Latin America \u2013 and of their economic needs. We have to explore relations with Latin America, where more than 400 million people will live by the turn of the century and where we have substantial interests\" <ref>Stevenson, Brian J.R. \"Canada, Latin America, and the New Internationalism: A Foreign Policy Analysis, 1968-1990\". (Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000) 114.</ref>\u2013 Pierre Elliot Trudeau\n\nBetween October and November 1968, Canada sent a delegate of various ministers to tour nine Latin American states (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]], Mexico, [[Costa Rica]], [[Guatemala]])<ref>Stevenson, Brian J.R. \"Canada, Latin America, and the New Internationalism: A Foreign Policy Analysis, 1968-1990\". (Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000) 116.</ref> as a stage in Canada's foreign policy review. From the excursion Canada aimed to a) evaluate potential benefits from increased relations, b) explore global policy congruence with individual Latin American states, c) improve overall relations in [[South America]]. Ultimately, the mission garnered results on several fronts related to issues of economic cooperation, integration and growth, security and nuclear non-proliferation, as well as general information gathering.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 75, 81.</ref>\n\nThe 1968 mission had two profound institutional effects. First, the mission directly led to the creation of a Latin American task force in 1969. This task force was at the forefront of issues involving Canada's role/potential role in joining the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS). Second, the mission was elemental in establishing the founding principles of the Latin American section of Trudeau's complete revision of foreign policy \u2013 a series of documents entitled \"Foreign Policy for Canadians\" released in 1970.<ref>Daudelin, Jean. \"Canada and the Americas: a Time for Modesty\". Behind the Headlines 64.3. (Canadian Institute of International Affairs 2007) 2.</ref> This series of documents considered massive changes in global power dynamics (e.g. the reduced threat of communism), the role of non-state actors, and the absolute necessity of preserving Canadian independence.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 67.</ref>\n\nIn the years following these diplomatic advancements came several key initiatives, programs and institutions. In 1971, to deal with issues of Latin American integration, Trudeau founded the Bureau of Western-Hemispheric Affairs. In 1972, Canada officially entered the OAS under observer status and joined the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] to increasingly aid developmental initiatives in Latin America. Further, by 1972, Canada had seen an increase of roughly 40% in exports to the region in only 4 years and made tremendous progress with individual states like Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela. In spite of some minor shortcomings in certain Latin American states, Canada was overwhelming pleased with advancements in relations between the two regions by 1973.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 83-84, 90.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1970s Canada's national policy toward Latin America \u2013 and other regions of the globe \u2013 had almost completely diverged from that of the United States. This was an especially momentous time in Canadian foreign politics because, until this point, Canada had been under the vast political and economic influence of her neighbour to the South. This incredible divergence was essentially manifested in [[Mitchell Sharp]]'s \"Options for the Future\" (otherwise known as the 'Third Option Paper'), which reaffirmed the tenets of \"Foreign Policy for Canadians\", but considered U.S.\u2013Canada relations in greater detail. Sharp's paper advocated the growth of Canadian economic, political and cultural 'distinctiveness', but did not encourage alienation from America. Ultimately, Sharp's ideas had a profound and lasting effect on Canadian policy and were central to the outward growth of Canada in the international sphere for many years.<ref>Stevenson, Brian J.R. \"Canada, Latin America, and the New Internationalism: A Foreign Policy Analysis, 1968-1990\". (Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000) 95.</ref>\n\nBy and large, the 1970s represented a period of growth in Canada\u2013Latin America relations that produced episodes of incredible significance and garnered tremendous potential for future relations. Importantly, the emerging distinctiveness of Canada on the global stage (in an increasingly multi-polar international system) was particularly visible in relations with Latin America. In radical deviation from the policies and ideological attitudes of the United States, Canada pursued policies of tolerance and acceptance with respect to Latin American states. Canadian tolerance was evident throughout the 1970s \u2013 with the acceptance of thousands of leftist Chilean refugees between 1970 and 1980, opposition to various American political interventions in South America, or Trudeau's tour of Mexico, Venezuela, and Cuba in 1976.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\".

Canada-Venezuela relations have been on good terms since the establishment of diplomatic relationship between the two countries in the 1950s. Those relations however began to sour under Conservative Prime Minister Harper and President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and became sour under Liberal Prime Minister Trudeau (2015- ). Indeed, over the past few years, Canada has stepped out of its comfort zone in hemispheric affairs, to speak and act forcefully, as Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland put it, in solidarity with \"the people of Venezuela and their desire to restore democracy and human in Venezuela\". On January 23rd, 2019, Minister Freeland issued the statement that \u201cCanada recognizes Juan Guaid\u00f3, President of the National Assembly, as the interim President of Venezuela.\" On that occasion she called the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro government \"despicable\". Ottawa imposed targeted sanctions (under the ''Special Economic Measures Act'' and the new ''[[Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act]]'') against 70 Maduro government officials.

This includes the bilateral ties between Canada and the individual Latin American states, [[plurilateral]] ties between Canada and any group of those states, or multilateral relations through groups like the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS).\n\nCanada and Latin America share ties of geography as part of the [[Western Hemisphere]] and history through the shared experience of [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]]. Culturally, Canada shares with the other societies in the Americas a mixture of European, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]], and immigrant influences. For both Canadians and Latin Americans, the importance of [[Foreign relations of the United States|relations with the United States]] may overshadow relations with each other. However Canada's importance in the region has risen since joining the OAS in 1990.\n\n==Historical relations to 1968==\nIn the decades following [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867, [[Canada]] had limited political involvement, but after 1898 had significant economic ties in the Caribbean, Mexico and Brazil and Canadians went as businessmen and missionaries to a number of other countries.<ref>J.C.M. Ogelsby, Gringos from the Far North, Essays in the History of Canadian-Latin American Relations, 1866-1968. Macmillan 1976.</ref> As Canadian foreign policy was largely constrained by Canada's ties to the British Empire, political and economic relations remained tethered and controlled. Even after Canada gained political autonomy in foreign relations with the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] (1931) relations with [[Latin America]] remained weak due to domestic economic turmoil.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 11-12.</ref>\n\nFollowing increased solidarity between regions in Latin America throughout the 1800s came the birth of the [[Pan-American Union]] in 1910. Between 1909 and 1941 Latin American states ([[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]] and others) repeatedly appealed for Canadian involvement in union. In accordance with the [[Monroe Doctrine]] the United States actively opposed Canadian involvement as Canada's foreign relations were subject to the interests of a European power, [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Nevertheless, Canada remained outside of the union for reasons of economic disinterest.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\".

Devastation in Europe due to World War II made Latin America a logical alternative. Unfortunately for Canadian interests, the period following the [[Second World War]] marked an important shift in the world political and economic order that saw the growth and spread of [[communism]].\n\nThe onset of the [[Cold War]] had important implications for Canadian foreign policy. Significantly, Canadian officials saw Latin America as a region particularly vulnerable to the spread of communism because of vast underdevelopment and socio-economic disparities.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 31.</ref> More importantly for Canada, however, was the immense propagation of American economic and political dominance and [[Americanization]] throughout the world. While Canada, like the [[United States]] during the early cold war years, could be viewed as a liberal-democracy devoted to the spread of [[capitalism]] and free market ideals, the Canadian form of the ideology was inherently more accepting of socialist facets. Effectively, Canada grew closer to many Latin American states and often acted as a mediator between the United States and Latin America.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\".

During this time Canada, under Trudeau's realist and pragmatist ideals, began to view relations with previously untapped global regions such as Latin America as vital to Canada's future political and economic interests. Trudeau illuminates these ideas:\n\"We have to take greater account of the ties which bind us to other nations in this hemisphere \u2013 in the Caribbean, Latin America \u2013 and of their economic needs. We have to explore relations with Latin America, where more than 400 million people will live by the turn of the century and where we have substantial interests\" <ref>Stevenson, Brian J.R. \"Canada, Latin America, and the New Internationalism: A Foreign Policy Analysis, 1968-1990\". (Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000) 114.</ref>\u2013 Pierre Elliot Trudeau\n\nBetween October and November 1968, Canada sent a delegate of various ministers to tour nine Latin American states (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]], Mexico, [[Costa Rica]], [[Guatemala]])<ref>Stevenson, Brian J.R. \"Canada, Latin America, and the New Internationalism: A Foreign Policy Analysis, 1968-1990\". (Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000) 116.</ref> as a stage in Canada's foreign policy review. From the excursion Canada aimed to a) evaluate potential benefits from increased relations, b) explore global policy congruence with individual Latin American states, c) improve overall relations in [[South America]]. Ultimately, the mission garnered results on several fronts related to issues of economic cooperation, integration and growth, security and nuclear non-proliferation, as well as general information gathering.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 75, 81.</ref>\n\nThe 1968 mission had two profound institutional effects. First, the mission directly led to the creation of a Latin American task force in 1969. This task force was at the forefront of issues involving Canada's role/potential role in joining the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS). Second, the mission was elemental in establishing the founding principles of the Latin American section of Trudeau's complete revision of foreign policy \u2013 a series of documents entitled \"Foreign Policy for Canadians\" released in 1970.<ref>Daudelin, Jean. \"Canada and the Americas: a Time for Modesty\". Behind the Headlines 64.3. (Canadian Institute of International Affairs 2007) 2.</ref> This series of documents considered massive changes in global power dynamics (e.g. the reduced threat of communism), the role of non-state actors, and the absolute necessity of preserving Canadian independence.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 67.</ref>\n\nIn the years following these diplomatic advancements came several key initiatives, programs and institutions. In 1971, to deal with issues of Latin American integration, Trudeau founded the Bureau of Western-Hemispheric Affairs. In 1972, Canada officially entered the OAS under observer status and joined the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] to increasingly aid developmental initiatives in Latin America. Further, by 1972, Canada had seen an increase of roughly 40% in exports to the region in only 4 years and made tremendous progress with individual states like Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela. In spite of some minor shortcomings in certain Latin American states, Canada was overwhelming pleased with advancements in relations between the two regions by 1973.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\". (Vancouver: UBC Press, 1994), 83-84, 90.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-1970s Canada's national policy toward Latin America \u2013 and other regions of the globe \u2013 had almost completely diverged from that of the United States. This was an especially momentous time in Canadian foreign politics because, until this point, Canada had been under the vast political and economic influence of her neighbour to the South. This incredible divergence was essentially manifested in [[Mitchell Sharp]]'s \"Options for the Future\" (otherwise known as the 'Third Option Paper'), which reaffirmed the tenets of \"Foreign Policy for Canadians\", but considered U.S.\u2013Canada relations in greater detail. Sharp's paper advocated the growth of Canadian economic, political and cultural 'distinctiveness', but did not encourage alienation from America. Ultimately, Sharp's ideas had a profound and lasting effect on Canadian policy and were central to the outward growth of Canada in the international sphere for many years.<ref>Stevenson, Brian J.R. \"Canada, Latin America, and the New Internationalism: A Foreign Policy Analysis, 1968-1990\". (Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2000) 95.</ref>\n\nBy and large, the 1970s represented a period of growth in Canada\u2013Latin America relations that produced episodes of incredible significance and garnered tremendous potential for future relations. Importantly, the emerging distinctiveness of Canada on the global stage (in an increasingly multi-polar international system) was particularly visible in relations with Latin America. In radical deviation from the policies and ideological attitudes of the United States, Canada pursued policies of tolerance and acceptance with respect to Latin American states. Canadian tolerance was evident throughout the 1970s \u2013 with the acceptance of thousands of leftist Chilean refugees between 1970 and 1980, opposition to various American political interventions in South America, or Trudeau's tour of Mexico, Venezuela, and Cuba in 1976.<ref>Rochlin, James. \"Discovering the Americas: The Evolution of Canadian Foreign Policy Towards Latin America\".

Canada-Venezuela relations have been on good terms since the establishment of diplomatic relationship between the two countries in the 1950s. Those relations however began to sour under Conservative Prime Minister Harper and President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and became sour under Liberal Prime Minister Trudeau (2015- ). Indeed, over the past few years, Canada has stepped out of its comfort zone in hemispheric affairs, to speak and act forcefully, as Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland put it, in solidarity with \"the people of Venezuela and their desire to restore democracy and human in Venezuela\". On January 23rd, 2019, Minister Freeland issued the statement that \u201cCanada recognizes Juan Guaid\u00f3, President of the National Assembly, as the interim President of Venezuela.\" On that occasion she called the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro government \"despicable\". Ottawa imposed targeted sanctions (under the ''Special Economic Measures Act'' and the new ''Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act'') against 70 Maduro government officials. Canada has sanctions and related measures in place against nineteen other countries in the world, but only against Venezuela in the southern hemisphere.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grenier|first=Yvon|date=2019-06-26|title=Canada and the Crisis in Venezuela|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3410555|journal=Oasis|volume=30|pages=55-75|via=}}</ref> Canada has been an active member of the Lima Group to put pressure on the Maduro regime. The Lima Group was established on August 8, 2017, in Lima, Peru, to coordinate participating countries\u2019 efforts and apply international pressure on Venezuela. Meetings of the group have been regularly attended by representatives from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Saint Lucia.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Canada|Latin America|Politics}}\n* [[Canada\u2013Central American Free Trade Agreement]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Additional sources==\n*Daudelin, Jean. \"Canada and the Americas: a Time for Modesty\".
