His parents were [[Scottish people|Scots]] who had settled in [[South Carolina]] in 1753. He is the brother of [[Louisa Wells Aikman|Louisa Susannah Wells]] and [[Helena Wells]].\n\nHe was sent to school in [[Dumfries]], [[Scotland]] in 1768, at the age of 11, and after completing his preparatory school studies he attended the [[University of Edinburgh]] for a year.\n\nWells returned to Charleston in 1771 and became a medical apprentice under [[Alexander Garden (naturalist)|Dr Alexander Garden]], a naturalist and  physician, who himself was a pupil of [[Charles Alston (botanist)|Charles Alston]], Director of the [[Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh|Botanical Gardens in Edinburgh]].\n\nIn 1775, soon after the commencement of the American War of Independence, he left Charleston suddenly, and went to [[London]] in England. He had been called upon to sign a paper the object of which was to unite the people in a resistance to the claims of the British Government. This he would not do. In 1776 he returned to the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study medicine graduating with his medical degree in 1778. In the autumn he returned to London, and attended a course of [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter's]] lectures, took instructions in practical Anatomy, and became a surgeon's pupil at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]].\n\nIn 1779 he went to [[Holland]] as a surgeon of the [[British Army]] attached to a Scottish regiment. There he received ill-treatment from his commanding officer, and resigned his commission. On the day on which he received his dismissal from the service, he challenged the officer to a [[duel]]: the officer refused to respond. Wells then moved to [[Leiden]] in the [[Netherlands]] and matriculated at the [[University of Leiden]] Feb. 19, 1780.<ref>Album Studiosorum Academiae Lugduno Batavae MDLXXV-MDCCCLXXV, kol. 1133.</ref><ref>Index to English speaking students who have graduated at Leyden university / by Edward Peacock, F.S.A. - London : For the Index society, by Longmans, Green & co. 1883, p. 103, 1133.</ref> On this University he prepared his dissertation.

He was \"at the same time an officer in a corps of volunteers; a printer, a bookseller, and a merchant, a trustee for some of his father's friends in England for the management of affairs of considerable importance in Carolina; and on one occasion exercised, at the instance of the Colonel Commandant of the militia, the office of Judge Advocate, in conducting a prosecution in a general court martial of militia officers.\" <ref>''Gentleman's Magazine'', November 1817.</ref> When the British withdrew from Charleston in December 1782, he traveled to [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. There he published the ''East Florida Gazette'', the first weekly newspaper printed in Florida. Other publications during the British period of Florida included the ''Address of the principal inhabitants of East Florida''. He returned to England in 1784 to practice medicine.\n\nIn 1790 he was appointed one of the Physicians to the [[Finsbury Dispensary]], and remained so until 1798. In 1793 he was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society]]. In 1798 he was elected Assistant Physician to [[St Thomas's Hospital]]; and in 1800 became one of the Physicians.

But they thought the cold was caused by the dew and frost, not the other way around. In the autumn of 1811 Wells took some measurements and soon came to doubt his old idea. He began serious experiments soon after and published the results in August 1814. He compared the formation of dew under varying conditions of material, location, temperature, humidity, weather, cloud cover, season, and time of day. Wells concluded that dew is a condensation of [[water vapor]] in the air caused by just the right combination of conditions involving especially temperature, temperature change, and heat conductivity of materials.\n\nWells' inquiry into the nature of dew were widely cited in the 1830s as an outstanding example of inductive scientific inquiry.<ref>Preface to ''An Essay on Dew and Several Appearances Connected with It,'' edited, with annotations by L.

He had been called upon to sign a paper the object of which was to unite the people in a resistance to the claims of the British Government. This he would not do. In 1776 he returned to the [[University of Edinburgh]] to study medicine graduating with his medical degree in 1778. In the autumn he returned to London, and attended a course of [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter's]] lectures, took instructions in practical Anatomy, and became a surgeon's pupil at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]].\n\nIn 1779 he went to [[Holland]] as an surgeon of the [[British Army]] attached to a Scottish regiment.

Ashley and several of the apartment's other residents were suspected of involvement in large-scale drug deals. Having previously served two years on a charge of [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]], Ashley had been witness to a pubroom stabbing several months earlier, when a friend of his attacked someone else before Ashley pulled him away. A search of the premises later turned up a small amount of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. Ashley's death led to the resignation of the [[chief constable]] of the police force responsible, and resulted in several prosecutions and is an important case in the history of British police shootings.\n\n==Prelude==\nJames \"Jimmy\" Ashley was a 39-year-old man from [[Liverpool]] living in [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], [[East Sussex]], on the south coast of England. He was suspected by [[Sussex Police]] of being involved in the distribution of heroin, and the police had heard unsubstantiated rumours that he owned a gun. Ashley and a group of friends occupied three flats in a converted house in Western Road. The police placed the building under surveillance in October 1997, though the operation was wound up without producing any substantive evidence.<ref name=\"davies\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/may/23/ukcrime.nickdavies|title=Armed and dangerous: the police with their fingers on the trigger|last=Davies|first=Nick|authorlink=Nick Davies|date=23 May 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 1998, Ashley was present when a friend he had been drinking with, Thomas \"Tosh\" McCrudden, stabbed and seriously wounded another man in an argument outside a pub in [[Hastings]] town centre, though Ashley's only involvement was to pull McCrudden away from the victim. In the following week, armed officers were deployed to pursue several leads but failed to apprehend McCrudden. Officers believed McCrudden was staying in the Western Road house and formulated a plan to raid it, which was approved by the [[deputy chief constable]], Mark Jordan.<ref name=\"davies\"/>\n\n==Shooting==\nOn 15 January, at approximately 0430, officers from Sussex Police executed a [[search warrant]] on the Western Road house. The operation had three stated objectives\u2014the apprehension of McCrudden, the retrieval of a large quantity of cocaine believed to have been delivered to the premises (based on a tip-off from a detective in the regional crime squad), and the seizure of a firearm believed to be kept there. The officers conducting the raid were briefed that McCrudden was dangerous and known to be in the flats, that there was a firearm in the building, and that Ashley was wanted for shooting a man in [[Eastbourne]] and had a previous conviction for attempted murder. At the time, it was the largest firearms operation in the force's history, using 25 armed officers. The operation used a technique known as \"Bermuda\", which was known to be high-risk as it involved lone officers rapidly entering an assigned room before calling in backup if a threat was found.

Justice Dobbs ruled, on [[summary judgment]], that the police's offer meant that continuing with the other claims would be an abuse of process, and that the action for battery had no realistic prospect of success as the burden of proof was on the claimants, who could not negate the self-defence claim of the officer responsible from the criminal trial.<ref name=\"fordham245\"/>\n\nThe Ashleys appealed the striking out of their claim for battery to the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]], where the case was heard in 2006. The Court of Appeal held that Dobbs had erred in her decision that the battery claim had no realistic prospect of success and in her decision that the burden of proof rested with the claimant to disprove a defence of self defence in a civil case. The court allowed the family's appeal, holding that\u2014in a civil action for negligence\u2014the burden was on the respondent (the police) to prove their claim of self-defence, and that the claim had to be based on both an \"honest\" and a \"reasonable\" belief of being in imminent danger, a higher standard than in criminal law. The majority also held that continuing the claim for battery would not be an abuse of process, even though the police had offered to pay the full amount of compensation sought by the family under the claim for negligence, meaning that they would receive no further damages if their claim for battery succeeded.

Ashley and several of the apartment's other residents were suspected of involvement in large-scale drug deals. Having previously served two years on a charge of [[manslaughter in English law|manslaughter]], Ashley had been witness to a pubroom stabbing several months earlier, when a friend of his attacked someone else before Ashley pulled him away. A search of the premises later turned up a small amount of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. Ashley's death led to the resignation of the [[chief constable]] of the police force responsible, and resulted in several prosecutions and is an important case in the history of British police shootings.\n\n==Prelude==\nJames \"Jimmy\" Ashley was a 39-year-old man from [[Liverpool]] living in [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], [[East Sussex]], on the south coast of England. He was suspected by [[Sussex Police]] of being involved in the distribution of heroin, and the police had heard unsubstantiated rumours that he owned a gun. Ashley and a group of friends occupied three flats in a converted house in Western Road. The police placed the building under surveillance in October 1997, though the operation was wound up without producing any substantive evidence.<ref name=\"davies\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/may/23/ukcrime.nickdavies|title=Armed and dangerous: the police with their fingers on the trigger|last=Davies|first=Nick|authorlink=Nick Davies|date=23 May 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 1998, Ashley was present when a friend he had been drinking with, Thomas \"Tosh\" McCrudden, stabbed and seriously wounded another man in an argument outside a pub in [[Hastings]] town centre, though Ashley's only involvement was to pull McCrudden away from the victim. In the following week, armed officers were deployed to pursue several leads but failed to apprehend McCrudden. Officers believed McCrudden was staying in the Western Road house and formulated a plan to raid it, which was approved by the [[deputy chief constable]], Mark Jordan.<ref name=\"davies\"/>\n\n==Shooting==\nOn 15 January, at approximately 0430, officers from Sussex Police executed a [[search warrant]] on the Western Road house. The operation had three stated objectives\u2014the apprehension of McCrudden, the retrieval of a large quantity of cocaine believed to have been delivered to the premises (based on a tip-off from a detective in the regional crime squad), and the seizure of a firearm believed to be kept there. The officers conducting the raid were briefed that McCrudden was dangerous and known to be in the flats, that there was a firearm in the building, and that Ashley was wanted for shooting a man in [[Eastbourne]] and had a previous conviction for attempted murder. At the time, it was the largest firearms operation in the force's history, using 25 armed officers. The operation used a technique known as \"Bermuda\", which was known to be high-risk as it involved lone officers rapidly entering an assigned room before calling in backup if a threat was found. The technique had previously been criticised in the media and other police forces had discontinued its use. Only four of the six occupants of the flats were the target of the raid, but the police did not have details of which occupants lived in which of the flats; the police also lacked plans for the building, hampering the raid as they encountered a locked internal door which had not been anticipated, and which blocked the door to Ashley's flat when open, delaying the officers in entering the flat.<ref name=\"davies\" /><ref>Punch, p. 12.</ref> \n\nAshley had been in bed with his girlfriend and got out of bed to investigate a noise, likely caused by police forcing doors in the building.

Justice Dobbs ruled, on [[summary judgment]], that the police's offer meant that continuing with the other claims would be an abuse of process, and that the action for battery had no realistic prospect of success as the burden of proof was on the claimants, who could not negate the self-defence claim of the officer responsible from the criminal trial.<ref name=\"fordham245\"/>\n\nThe Ashleys appealed the striking out of their claim for battery to the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]], where the case was heard in 2006. The Court of Appeal held that Dobbs had erred in her decision that the battery claim had no realistic prospect of success and in her decision that the the burden of proof rested with the claimant to disprove a defence of self defence in a civil case. The court allowed the family's appeal, holding that\u2014in a civil action for negligence\u2014the burden was on the respondent (the police) to prove their claim of self-defence, and that the claim had to be based on both an \"honest\" and a \"reasonable\" belief of being in imminent danger, a higher standard than in criminal law. The majority also held that continuing the claim for battery would not be an abuse of process, even though the police had offered to pay the full amount of compensation sought by the family under the claim for negligence, meaning that they would receive no further damages if their claim for battery succeeded. The police appealed the decision to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]].<ref name=\"fordham245\"/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notes}}\n\n== References ==\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite journal|last=Fordham|first=Margaret|date=July 2009|title=A Policeman, a Gun, and a Fatal Mistake\u2014Self Defence in the Tort of Batery: Ashley v.
