It was because the radio personality she heard in middle school was a voice actor, that she yearned to be a voice actress, admiring the fact there was a job \"like that.\" She is from a 16th graduating class for Aoni Juku Osaka School. Hirohashi made her voice acting debut in the series ''[[Aquarian Age: Sign for Evolution]]''.

Matsue is located at the northernmost point of Shimane Prefecture,  between [[Lake Shinji]] and [[Nakaumi]] on the banks of the Ohashi River connecting the two [[lake]]s, though the [[city proper]] reaches the [[Sea of Japan]] coast. Matsue is the center of the Lake Shinji-Nakaumi [[metropolitan area]], and with a population of approximately 600,000 is the second largest on the Sea of Japan coast after [[Niigata (city)|Niigata]]. Matsue is sometimes called the {{Nihongo|\"water city\"|\u6c34\u306e\u90fd}} due to the prominence of the lakes, [[river]]s and [[canal]]s in the city-scape and scenery.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nMatsue is home to the  [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]]-era [[Matsue Castle]], one of the last surviving [[feudal]] castles in Japan.\n\n== History ==\n{{stack|[[File:Matsue01.jpg|thumb|City view from [[Matsue Castle]]]]}}\nThe present-day castle town of Matsue was originally established by [[Horio Yoshiharu]], lord of the Matsue clan, when he built Matsue castle and planned the surrounding Castle town over a five-year period from 1607 to 1611. Matsue continued to be the seat of power in the Sanin Region for many years.\n\nMatsue was first ruled by the Horio family. Horio Yoshiharu's son Tadauji died before his father, thus the province was inherited by his grandson Tadaharu. However, Tadaharu died childless so the province was passed on to the [[Ky\u014dgoku clan|Kyogoku]]. The Kyogoku were ''daimy\u014d'' from Omi and Wakasa. Kyogoku Takatsugu served Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Takatsugu's son Tadataka married the 4th daughter of Hidetada, Hatsu. He served in the Battle of Osaka and reportedly took 300 heads. In 1634, he received the province of Izumo, succeeding the childless Horio Tadaharu. During his rule he was instrumental in engineering projects that helped control the flow of the Hiikawa river.\n\nIn 1637, Tadataka also died childless and the domain passed to the Matsudaira. Naomasa was the third son of Hideyasu. Hideyasu, daimy\u014d of Echizen, himself was the second son of Tokugawa Ieyasu, making Naomasa the grandson of the first Tokugawa Sh\u014dgun Ieyasu. Naomasa made a name for himself fighting in the Battle of Osaka at the age of 14. He was daimy\u014d of Ono in Echizen and later Matsumoto in Shinano before becoming the ruler of Izumo 1638. Unlike the previous rulers Naomasa had children and his heirs managed to keep Izumo for ten generations until the end of the Edo Bakufu.\nOverall, ten Matsudaira Daimy\u014d ruled from Matsue. The most famous after the first (Matsudaira Naomasa) is the seventh, [[Matsudaira Harusato]], more commonly referred to as Lord Fumai (\u4e0d\u6627\u516c).<ref>https://fumaikou.jp/about</ref> He revolutionized the administrative system of the Matsue clan which was in financial difficulties and put it back on its feet. He invested in Mulberry bushes and promoted special foods like clams that were a delicacy in Matsue. Harusato was a great enthusiast of Tea Ceremony. His Tea Ceremony name was Fumai. He founded his own school, Unshyu. He has left the Meimei-An a famous tea house still operating in Matsue. Because his influence on wagashi, Japanese sweets for Tea Ceremony from Matsue are famous, especially one called ''wakakusa''.\n\nThe city boasts [[Matsue Castle]], the \"black castle\" or \"plover castle\". It is one of the 12 remaining original castles in Japan. It is the second largest, the third tallest and the sixth oldest. The castle grounds include a winding path through mixed forests of bamboo, shrubs and trees, many of which are very old and identified by species. Surrounding the grounds and the castle park is the old moat, \"horikawa\".\n\nAuthor [[Lafcadio Hearn]] taught in Matsue from 1890\u20131891. His [[Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum|house is now a museum]] about his life, and a popular tourist attraction in Matsue. Throughout the city there are monuments and landmarks honouring Hearn. Other museums in the city include the [[Shimane Art Museum]] and [[Tanabe Art Museum]].\n\n[[Sada Jinja]] in Matsue is the home to Sada Shin Noh, a sacred dance comprising a series of purification rituals related to the changing of the rush mats within the shrine. The mats are held by dancers who then offer them to deities to sit upon. Diverse dance forms are performed on a stage in the shrine accompanied by singing, flute and drums. The performance art is transmitted from generation to generation by the community.

Matsue is located at the northernmost point of Shimane Prefecture,  between [[Lake Shinji]] and [[Nakaumi]] on the banks of the Ohashi River connecting the two [[lake]]s, though the [[city proper]] reaches the [[Sea of Japan]] coast. Matsue is the center of the Lake Shinji-Nakaumi [[metropolitan area]], and with a population of approximately 600,000 is the second largest on the Sea of Japan coast after [[Niigata (city)|Niigata]]. Matsue is sometimes called the {{Nihongo|\"water city\"|\u6c34\u306e\u90fd}} due to the prominence of the lakes, [[river]]s and [[canal]]s in the city-scape and scenery.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nMatsue is home to the  [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]]-era [[Matsue Castle]], one of the last surviving [[feudal]] castles in Japan.\n\n== History ==\n{{stack|[[File:Matsue01.jpg|thumb|City view from [[Matsue Castle]]]]}}\nThe present-day castle town of Matsue was originally established by [[Horio Yoshiharu]], lord of the Matsue clan, when he built Matsue castle and planned the surrounding Castle town over a five-year period from 1607 to 1611. Matsue continued to be the seat of power in the Sanin Region for many years.\n\nMatsue was first ruled by the Horio family. Horio Yoshiharu's son Tadauji died before his father, thus the province was inherited by his grandson Tadaharu. However, Tadaharu died childless so the province was passed on to the [[Ky\u014dgoku clan|Kyogoku]]. The Kyogoku were ''daimy\u014d'' from Omi and Wakasa. Kyogoku Takatsugu served Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Takatsugu's son Tadataka married the 4th daughter of Hidetada, Hatsu. He served in the Battle of Osaka and reportedly took 300 heads. In 1634, he received the province of Izumo, succeeding the childless Horio Tadaharu. During his rule he was instrumental in engineering projects that helped control the flow of the Hiikawa river.\n\nIn 1637, Tadataka also died childless and the domain passed to the Matsudaira. Naomasa was the third son of Hideyasu. Hideyasu, daimy\u014d of Echizen, himself was the second son of Tokugawa Ieyasu, making Naomasa the grandson of the first Tokugawa Sh\u014dgun Ieyasu. Naomasa made a name for himself fighting in the Battle of Osaka at the age of 14. He was daimy\u014d of Ono in Echizen and later Matsumoto in Shinano before becoming the ruler of Izumo 1638. Unlike the previous rulers Naomasa had children and his heirs managed to keep Izumo for ten generations until the end of the Edo Bakufu.\nOverall, ten Matsudaira Daimy\u014d ruled from Matsue. The most famous after the first (Matsudaira Naomasa) is the seventh, [[Matsudaira Harusato]], more commonly referred to as Lord Fumai (\u4e0d\u6627\u516c).<ref>https://fumaikou.jp/about</ref> He revolutionized the administrative system of the Matsue clan which was in financial difficulties and put it back on its feet. He invested in Mulberry bushes and promoted special foods like clams that were a delicacy in Matsue. Harusato was a great enthusiast of Tea Ceremony. His Tea Ceremony name was Fumai. He founded his own school, Unshyu. He has left the Meimei-An a famous tea house still operating in Matsue. Because his influence on wagashi, Japanese sweets for Tea Ceremony from Matsue are famous, especially one called ''wakakusa''.\n\nThe city boasts [[Matsue Castle]], the \"black castle\" or \"plover castle\". It is one of the 12 remaining original castles in Japan. It is the second largest, the third tallest and the sixth oldest. The castle grounds include a winding path through mixed forests of bamboo, shrubs and trees, many of which are very old and identified by species. Surrounding the grounds and the castle park is the old moat, \"horikawa\".\n\nAuthor [[Lafcadio Hearn]] taught in Matsue from 1890\u20131891. His [[Lafcadio Hearn Memorial Museum|house is now a museum]] about his life, and a popular tourist attraction in Matsue. Throughout the city there are monuments and landmarks honouring Hearn. Other museums in the city include the [[Shimane Art Museum]] and [[Tanabe Art Museum]].\n\n[[Sada Jinja]] in Matsue is the home to Sada Shin Noh, a sacred dance comprising a series of purification rituals related to the changing of the rush mats within the shrine. The mats are held by dancers who then offer them to deities to sit upon. Diverse dance forms are performed on a stage in the shrine accompanied by singing, flute and drums. The performance art is transmitted from generation to generation by the community. In November 2011, Sada Shin Noh was inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&pg=00011&RL=00412 |title=Sada Shin Noh, sacred dancing at Sada shrine, Shimane |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref> Other important shrines include [[Yaegaki Shrine|Yaegaki Jinja]], [[Kamosu Jinja]], and [[Miho Jinja]], and there are the ruins of [[Izumo Province|Izumo]] [[Provincial temple|Kokubunji]], an [[Monuments of Japan|Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kunishitei.bunka.go.jp/heritage/detail/401/2149 |title=Izumo Kokunbunji |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |accessdate=31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Municipal timeline ===\n* April 1, 1889: the original city of Matsue was founded. \n* March 31, 2005: the original city of Matsue absorbed the towns of [[Kashima, Shimane|Kashima]], [[Mihonoseki, Shimane|Mihonoseki]], [[Shimane, Shimane|Shimane]], [[Shinji, Shimane|Shinji]], [[Tamayu, Shimane|Tamayu]] and [[Yatsuka, Shimane|Yatsuka]], and the village of [[Yakumo, Shimane|Yakumo]], all from [[Yatsuka District, Shimane|Yatsuka District]], to create the new and expanded city of Matsue.\n* August 1, 2011: the town of [[Higashiizumo, Shimane|Higashiizumo]] (also from [[Yatsuka District, Shimane|Yatsuka District]]) was merged into Matsue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanin-chuo.co.jp/news/modules/news/article.php?storyid=523566006 |script-title=ja:\u677e\u6c5f\u5e02\u304c\u4eba\u53e3\u300c\u6700\u4e0b\u4f4d\u300d\u3092\u8fd4\u4e0a |publisher=Sanin-Ch\u016b\u014d Shimbun |language=ja |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224233713/http://www.sanin-chuo.co.jp/news/modules/news/article.php?storyid=523566006 |archive-date=2010-12-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nMatsue has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'') with very warm summers and cool winters.

When they were young, their father and most of their hive were attacked and killed by local Imperials, forcing Miek to flee underground. They were accidentally rescued, as an outcast slave, during Hulk's battle with the Red King. Soon after, the Warbound escaped with Miek secretly leading them to the place where their father was killed. The Warbound then aided them in securing their revenge. Miek and Brood, who have formed a connection due to their insect nature, freed Miek's brothers and added the Warbound to their Hive. Within a short time they underwent a metamorphosis and evolved into a giant heavily armoured \"King\" version of their race.\n\nMiek located one of the last Queens of their race, at an egg farm at which the Warbound were hiding. Unfortunately for Miek, and their species, the Queen was consumed by a Spike infection and had to be killed.{{issue|date=March 2013}} Miek led the Warbound in Hulk's place while [[Hulk]], [[Hiroim]], and [[Caiera]] attempted to obtain the allegiance of Caiera and Hiroim's people.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nFollowing the death of Caiera Oldstrong, Miek and the rest of the Warbound accompanied the Hulk back to Earth, where they pledged to aid him in a quest of vengeance against those responsible for the Hulk's forced exile.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4 (2007)</ref>\n\nOn Earth, Miek was one of the most vocal in encouraging the destruction of the planet in revenge for what was done. By the end, it was revealed that Miek knew all along that the Illuminati were not responsible. Red King loyalists had planted a damaged warp core on the Hulk's ship hoping it would kill the Hulk. Miek did not tell the Hulk hoping it would encourage the Hulk to keep destroying. Enraged, the Hulk and [[No-Name]] nearly killed Miek.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #5 (2007)</ref> After the Hulk's defeat Miek was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. in Wonderland and relayed information about the Warbound to help recapture them.<ref>''World War Hulk Aftersmash: Warbound'' #1 (2008)</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Miek was presumably still imprisoned in the Negative Zone supervised by Wonderland's freed inmates.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\n===Chaos War===\nMiek made a full recovery as they remained locked away in Prison 42 and stayed there until Amatsu-Mikaboshi became the Chaos King and attacked all of reality. As order gave way to chaos, Miek found his freedom along with many other prisoners. They pledged their service to the Chaos King, who sought to destroy everything much like Miek wished Hulk would.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nMiek, with an army of other former prisoners, attacked Amadeus Cho and Galactus as they attempted to complete a gateway to a pocket universe to save creation. Cho recognized them from the attack on New York but could not reason with them. Miek was unwilling to trust anything Cho said and tried to stop Cho from completing the gateway. Despite Miek initially had the upper hand and nearly killed Cho, an earthquake caused by the fight between Chaos King and Hercules caused them to lose their prey. Amadeus quickly knocked him with the Golden Mace, causing Miek to fly away.<ref>''Chaos War'' #5</ref>\n\n===Planet Savage===\nMiek found that as a result of their exposure to the Chaos King's energies, they had become biologically female. This allowed them to lay clutches of eggs, but the hatchlings could not survive long after birthing. Miek found their way to the Savage Land, and in the process of asserting themselves there, slaughtered forty-three Sakaarian refugees residing there. They had also grown considerably larger and more powerful through this time. Ka-Zar contacted Hulk regarding the deaths of the Sakaarians, and Hulk assembled their Warbound and headed there directly, despite the grievous injuries they'd sustained from his battle with Zeus. During the Warbound's first night there, the Sakaarian elder had drugged the group, allowing Miek and his insect horde to abduct the Hulk. The elder had made an agreement with Miek that his people would be spared if he helped Miek obtain the Hulk as a sacrifice.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #622</ref>\n\nMiek had attempted to supplant their hatchlings into the bodies of Sakaarians, to keep them fed and safe, but that had not worked. When attempting it with the Hulk's unconscious body, the hatchlings thrived. Using exceedingly strong insect chemicals, Miek kept the Hulk drugged and under mind control while his hatchlings gestated in Hulk's chest, even sending the mind-controlled Hulk against his own Warbound in an attempt to stop them from rescuing his captive. When the Hulk's rage burned off the mind control, Miek tried to convince the Warbound to help them keep his hatchlings alive.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #623</ref>\n\nHulk then tore the infants from his chest and attempted to stomp them, before he set about killing Miek. Skaar then tackled Hulk, smashing his head into the ground, and calling him a \"stupid monster\". Skaar promised the infant insects that no one would hurt them and that he'd care for them, as he could sympathize with their plight. Miek attempted to drug Skaar, to make him kill his father, only to have another of their arms chopped off by Hulk, who then punched Miek through a volcano and across the Savage Land into a mountain of ice. Hulk chased after and tried to save Miek, but Miek would not let him, and fell presumably to their death.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #625</ref>\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\nAs a Sakaaran Native, Miek hatched from an egg in a grub-like larval stage and eventually entered a cocoon-like pupae stage after several months.  Six months later, they emerged from their cocoon as an adult Native, with fully formed antennae, six limbs, and postpharyngeal glands used to communicate with other members of their familial hive.  Later in life, Miek entered into a second pupae stage and emerged as a Native king, with an armor-like chitinous carapace, longer mandibles, clawed phalanges, and overall greater body mass.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Anthony Flamini|Flamini, Anthony]] & Pak, Greg |penciller=[[Jim Calafiore|Calafiore, James]] |title=Planet Hulk: Gladiator Guidebook |issue=#1 |date=July 19, 2006 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\nAs a gladiator on Sakaar, they developed six-limbed fighting skills, often wielding four weapons at a time to keep their opponents off-balance.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Anthony Flamini|Flamini, Anthony]] & Pak, Greg |penciller=[[Jim Calafiore|Calafiore, James]] |title=Planet Hulk: Gladiator Guidebook |issue=#1 |date=July 19, 2006 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Marvel Zombies Return''===\nIn the 4th issue of ''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]'', when Hulk and the Warbound land on the moon they are met by zombiefied versions of [[Giant Man]] and the Immortals.

When they were young, their father and most of their hive were attacked and killed by local Imperials, forcing Miek to flee underground. They were accidentally rescued, as an outcast slave, during Hulk's battle with the Red King. Soon after, the Warbound escaped with Miek secretly leading them to the place where their father was killed. The Warbound then aided them in securing their revenge. Miek and Brood, who have formed a connection due to their insect nature, freed Miek's brothers and added the Warbound to their Hive. Within a short time they underwent a metamorphosis and evolved into a giant heavily armoured \"King\" version of their race.\n\nMiek located one of the last Queens of their race, at an egg farm at which the Warbound were hiding. Unfortunately for Miek, and their species, the Queen was consumed by a Spike infection and had to be killed.{{issue|date=March 2013}} Miek led the Warbound in Hulk's place while [[Hulk]], [[Hiroim]], and [[Caiera]] attempted to obtain the allegiance of Caiera and Hiroim's people.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nFollowing the death of Caiera Oldstrong, Miek and the rest of the Warbound accompanied the Hulk back to Earth, where they pledged to aid him in a quest of vengeance against those responsible for the Hulk's forced exile.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #4 (2007)</ref>\n\nOn Earth, Miek was one of the most vocal in encouraging the destruction of the planet in revenge for what was done. By the end, it was revealed that Miek knew all along that the Illuminati were not responsible. Red King loyalists had planted a damaged warp core on the Hulk's ship hoping it would kill the Hulk. Miek did not tell the Hulk hoping it would encourage the Hulk to keep destroying. Enraged, the Hulk and [[No-Name]] nearly killed Miek.<ref>''World War Hulk'' #5 (2007)</ref> After the Hulk's defeat Miek was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. in Wonderland and relayed information about the Warbound to help recapture them.<ref>''World War Hulk Aftersmash: Warbound'' #1 (2008)</ref>\n\nFollowing the ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' storyline, Miek was presumably still imprisoned in the Negative Zone supervised by Wonderland's freed inmates.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\n===Chaos War===\nMiek made a full recovery as they remained locked away in Prison 42 and stayed there until Amatsu-Mikaboshi became the Chaos King and attacked all of reality. As order gave way to chaos, Miek found his freedom along with many other prisoners. They pledged their service to the Chaos King, who sought to destroy everything much like Miek wished Hulk would.{{issue|date=March 2013}}\n\nMiek, with an army of other former prisoners, attacked Amadeus Cho and Galactus as they attempted to complete a gateway to a pocket universe to save creation. Cho recognized them from the attack on New York but could not reason with them. Miek was unwilling to trust anything Cho said and tried to stop Cho from completing the gateway. Despite Miek initially had the upper hand and nearly killed Cho, an earthquake caused by the fight between Chaos King and Hercules caused them to lose their prey. Amadeus quickly knocked him with the Golden Mace, causing Miek to fly away.<ref>''Chaos War'' #5</ref>\n\n===Planet Savage===\nMiek found that as a result of their exposure to the Chaos King's energies, they had become biologically female. This allowed them to lay clutches of eggs, but the hatchlings could not survive long after birthing. Miek found their way to the Savage Land, and in the process of asserting themselves there, slaughtered forty-three Sakaarian refugees residing there. They had also grown considerably larger and more powerful through this time. Ka-Zar contacted Hulk regarding the deaths of the Sakaarians, and Hulk assembled their Warbound and headed there directly, despite the grievous injuries they'd sustained from his battle with Zeus. During the Warbound's first night there, the Sakaarian elder had drugged the group, allowing Miek and his insect horde to abduct the Hulk. The elder had made an agreement with Miek that his people would be spared if he helped Miek obtain the Hulk as a sacrifice.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #622</ref>\n\nMiek had attempted to supplant their hatchlings into the bodies of Sakaarians, to keep them fed and safe, but that had not worked. When attempting it with the Hulk's unconscious body, the hatchlings thrived. Using exceedingly strong insect chemicals, Miek kept the Hulk drugged and under mind control while his hatchlings gestated in Hulk's chest, even sending the mind-controlled Hulk against his own Warbound in an attempt to stop them from rescuing his captive. When the Hulk's rage burned off the mind control, Miek tried to convince the Warbound to help them keep his hatchlings alive.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #623</ref>\n\nHulk then tore the infants from his chest and attempted to stomp them, before he set about killing Miek. Skaar then tackled Hulk, smashing his head into the ground, and calling him a \"stupid monster\". Skaar promised the infant insects that no one would hurt them and that he'd care for them, as he could sympathize with their plight. Miek attempted to drug Skaar, to make him kill his father, only to have another of their arms chopped off by Hulk, who then punched Miek through a volcano and across the Savage Land into a mountain of ice. Hulk chased after and tried to save Miek, but Miek would not let him, and fell presumably to their death.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #625</ref>\n\n==Powers and Abilities==\nAs a Sakaaran Native, Miek hatched from an egg in a grub-like larval stage and eventually entered a cocoon-like pupae stage after several months.  Six months later, they emerged from their cocoon as an adult Native, with fully formed antennae, six limbs, and postpharyngeal glands used to communicate with other members of their familial hive.  Later in life, Miek entered into a second pupae stage and emerged as a Native king, with an armor-like chitinous carapace, longer mandibles, clawed phalanges, and overall greater body mass.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Anthony Flamini|Flamini, Anthony]] & Pak, Greg |penciller=[[Jim Calafiore|Calafiore, James]] |title=Planet Hulk: Gladiator Guidebook |issue=#1 |date=July 19, 2006 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\nAs a gladiator on Sakaar, they developed six-limbed fighting skills, often wielding four weapons at a time to keep their opponents off-balance.<ref>{{Cite comic |writer=[[Anthony Flamini|Flamini, Anthony]] & Pak, Greg |penciller=[[Jim Calafiore|Calafiore, James]] |title=Planet Hulk: Gladiator Guidebook |issue=#1 |date=July 19, 2006 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n\n===''Marvel Zombies Return''===\nIn the 4th issue of ''[[Marvel Zombies Return]]'', when Hulk and the Warbound land on the moon they are met by zombiefied versions of [[Giant Man]] and the Immortals.

An updated version with additional content entitled ''Accounting+'' was released on December 19, 2017 for PlayStation VR, and eventually on PC on October 18, 2018.\n\n==Gameplay and plot==\nThe player is introduced in a small basement office by two accountants ([[William Pugh (game designer)|William Pugh]] and Dominik Johann) through a phone call as a candidate for a new \"virtual reality accounting\" experiment, which supposedly increases efficiency in accounting: the player is invited to put on (in-game) a VR helmet. The player is then teleported to a small idyllic meadow, but that's interrupted by a puffy white person sticking out of a [[tree hollow]] ([[Justin Roiland]]) throwing insults and profanity at the player for showing up uninvited. The accountants contact the player through a [[landline phone]] and express their panic about the experiment going wrong, while the player can use a nearby VR helmet to go one level deeper into virtual reality. The player arrives in an alleyway where four animal-like gangsters Ging ([[Cassie Steele]]), Zing ([[Rich Fulcher]]), Ming (Vatche Panos), and Ding (Roiland) are holding a profanity-laden conversation. The gang name the player 'Scooter' and exhort him to do illegal acts until the player throws a brick through a window, alerting the police. Using Ding's posterior as a headset, the player then escapes to a dungeon, meeting The King of VR (Panos), another puffy obese creature, who is initially friendly but gradually turns insulting; the player stabs and disembowels the King, and pulls out yet another VR helmet from its body to go one level deeper. In the next world, a player finds a [[xylophone]] made out of bones, with two chatty skulls (Roiland and Steele) attached, who urge the player to use other bones to play the xylophone, appearing to have some sort of sexual satisfaction if the player does so and disappointment if the player stops. In a cabinet behind the player, a small jar of acid is found: drinking it causes the player to die. In the PlayStation VR and SteamVR version, a coin in the cabinet can be used to enter a door, transporting the player to a room with two fast-food addicted demon worshippers ([[Chelsea Kane]] and Roiland). They help the player to summon Satan with the help of a rap [[mixtape]] performed by [[Casper (rapper)|Casper]]. After the player eats a plate of feces, Satan arrives and squashes everyone.\n\nEither way, the player dies and arrives back one layer in virtual reality, where the player is on trial for killing The King. Though the player has access to a variety of Little Public Defenders ([[Echo Kellum]], Kane, and Scott Chernoff), tiny egg-like defense lawyers who argue the player's innocence, picking them up and throwing them around will upset the judge (Roiland) who orders the player's execution via [[guillotine]]. The player arrives one layer back in reality in the car of the animal gang. They are fleeing the police and Ding is dead; soon after Ging and Ming die as well. Zing, the driver, encourages you to shoot the fleeing police with a 'seed gun' which causes their cars to explode. The shootout ends with the player defeating the chief of police, a robot pirate captain (Joe Finegold). Zing dies by the player's hand, and the car crashes. Then the player appears in the meadow again, but it's entirely on fire, and the tree person angrily orders the player to keep a talking bomb ([[Arin Hanson]]) away from the blaze. The player is too late, however, and the bomb explodes, killing the player once again and bringing them back to the basement, where the accountants express their joy about the successful experiment, and the end credits are displayed on a whiteboard. The player can at this point find a loaded gun in a drawer and shoot themselves in the head, which then removes the final layer of (actual) virtual reality and ends the game.

An updated version with additional content entitled ''Accounting+'' was released on December 19, 2017 for PlayStation VR, and eventually on PC on October 18, 2018.\n\n==Gameplay and plot==\nThe player is introduced in a small basement office by two accountants ([[William Pugh (game designer)|William Pugh]] and Dominik Johann) through a phone call as a candidate for a new \"virtual reality accounting\" experiment, which supposedly increases efficiency in accounting: the player is invited to put on (in-game) a VR helmet. The player is then teleported to a small idyllic meadow, but that's interrupted by a puffy white person sticking out of a [[tree hollow]] ([[Justin Roiland]]) throwing insults and profanity at the player for showing up uninvited. The accountants contact the player through a [[landline phone]] and express their panic about the experiment going wrong, while the player can use a nearby VR helmet to go one level deeper into virtual reality. The player arrives in an alleyway where four animal-like gangsters Ging ([[Cassie Steele]]), Zing ([[Rich Fulcher]]), Ming (Vatche Panos), and Ding (Roiland) are holding a profanity-laden conversation. The gang name the player 'Scooter' and exhort him to do illegal acts until the player throws a brick through a window, alerting the police. Using Ding's posterior as a headset, the player then escapes to a dungeon, meeting The King of VR (Panos), another puffy obese creature, who is initially friendly but gradually turns insulting; the player stabs and disembowels the King, and pulls out yet another VR helmet from its body to go one level deeper. In the next world, a player finds a [[xylophone]] made out of bones, with two chatty skulls (Roiland and Steele) attached, who urge the player to use other bones to play the xylophone, appearing to have some sort of sexual satisfaction if the player does so and disappointment if the player stops. In a cabinet behind the player, a small jar of acid is found: drinking it causes the player to die. In the PlayStation VR and SteamVR version, a coin in the cabinet can be used to enter a door, transporting the player to a room with two fast-food addicted demon worshippers ([[Chelsea Kane]] and Roiland). They help the player to summon Satan with the help of a rap [[mixtape]] performed by [[Casper (rapper)|Casper]]. After the player eats a plate of feces, Satan arrives and squashes everyone.\n\nEither way, the player dies and arrives back one layer in virtual reality, where the player is on trial for killing The King. Though the player has access to a variety of Little Public Defenders ([[Echo Kellum]], Kane, and Scott Chernoff), tiny egg-like defense lawyers who argue the player's innocence, picking them up and throwing them around will upset the judge (Roiland) who orders the player's execution via [[guillotine]]. The player arrives one layer back in reality in the car of the animal gang. They are fleeing the police and Ding is dead; soon after Ging and Ming die as well. Zing, the driver, encourages you to shoot the fleeing police with a 'seed gun' which causes their cars to explode. The shootout ends with the player defeating the chief of police, a robot pirate captain (Joe Finegold). Zing dies by the player's hand, and the car crashes. Then the player appears in the meadow again, but it's entirely on fire, and the tree person angrily orders the player to keep a talking bomb ([[Arin Hanson]]) away from the blaze. The player is too late, however, and the bomb explodes, killing the player once again and bringing them back to the basement, where the accountants express their joy about the successful experiment, and the end credits are displayed on a whiteboard. The player can at this point find a loaded gun in a drawer and shoot themselves in the head, which then removes the final layer of (actual) virtual reality and ends the game. If the player chooses to flip the whiteboard after the accountants finish their dialogue, it leaves you with a special message from [[Reggie Watts]].\n\nThroughout the game, the player can interact with a variety of objects, which don't change the outcome of the game, and most characters will continue their dialogue indefinitely. ''Accounting+'' features a tutorial hosted by the soft spoken narrator Clovis (Pugh) and a hidden level where a clown in a waterpark control room rants about another hidden level.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Justin Roiland]] as Tree Guy / The Judge / Derek Smith / Skeleton Boy / Cool Knight / Ding \n* [[Cassie Steele]] as Skeltal Girl / Ging\n* Vatche Panos as The King of VR / Ming\n* [[Rich Fulcher]] as Zing\n* Joe Finegold as The Gatekeeper / The Final Boss / The Brick\n* [[Echo Kellum]] and Scott Chernoff as Little Public Defenders / Cops\n* [[Arin Hanson]] as The Bomb\n* [[Chelsea Kane]] as Little Public Defender / Enthusiastic Occultist\n* Tom Schley as The Lone Bard / Flute Guy\n* Alicia Contestabile as White Magic Summoner\n* [[William Pugh (game designer)|William Pugh]] as  Accountant A / Clovis / Dark Serious\n* Dominik Johann as Accountant 1 / The Biggest Fan / Slorn\n* [[Casper (rapper)|Benjamin Griffey]] as Ritual Rapper\n* [[Reggie Watts]] as Just Keep Flipping (PS4 Version)\n* [[Dan Harmon]] as Just Keep Flipping (PC Version)\n\n==Sources==\n* [https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/rick-morty-creator-makes-vr-game-accounting-funny-w439390 The Rolling Stone]\n* [https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/rick-morty-co-creator-sits-with-ars-shows-us-what-accounting-looks-like-in-vr/ Arstechnica]\n* [https://thenextweb.com/gaming/2016/09/14/rick-and-morty-co-creators-first-vr-game-is-an-absurd-adventure-about-accounting/ The Next Web inf]\n* [http://www.digitaltrends.com/virtual-reality/squanchtendo-accounting-vr-hands-on/ Digital trends]\n* [https://venturebeat.com/2016/09/13/accounting-is-a-free-htc-vive-vr-game-from-the-creators-of-rick-morty-and-the-stanley-parable/ Venture beat listing]\n* [https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/09/13/accounting-free-vr-game/ Game data]\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://accountingvr.com/}}\n* {{IMDb title|7772228}}\n\n[[Category:2016 video games]]\n[[Category:Adventure games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only games]]\n[[Category:Oculus Rift games]]\n[[Category:HTC Vive games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation VR games]]\n", "name_user": "Nealbo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGameplay and plot:clean up,typo(s) fixed: soft spoken \u2192 soft-spoken", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_(video_game)"}

After losing consciousness and dying, she wakes in another world in the body of Iris, the villain of an [[otome game]] she had been playing before she died. To her shock she discovers that she has reincarnated at the exact moment where Iris's former fianc\u00e9, Prince Edward, confronts her in front of the entire school over her bullying of Yuri, the daughter of a baron and the game's heroine. Thinking fast, Iris manages to leave the school with her dignity intact and upon returning home, is also able to avoid being sent to a [[nunnery]], the fate of the original Iris. Impressed by her rational thinking, Iris's father Duke Louis de Armelia leaves her in control of the family's [[fief]] in place of her brother Bern, who is one of Edward's supporters and is also in love with Yuri.\n\nAs the series progresses Iris uses her knowledge from her previous life to bring about major, positive changes and products to her fief and the kingdom such as the concept of banking and schooling for commoners who would otherwise not receive an education. She also introduces products that had not previously existed in the kingdom or were only available in a crude format such as chocolate and cosmetics, going so far as to create her own successful business. This brings both positive and negative attention to Iris, her family, and the fief, especially as it angers Prince Edward, who wanted her to be more severely punished. It's also shown that Iris was not responsible for all of the bullying claimed by Yuri, as she had only spread rumors and made negative comments, and that Iris was a far kinder person than the one portrayed in the game's storyline. Furthermore, Yuri's personality is shown to possibly be a facade. It is also hinted that she is a spy sent to disrupt the kingdom and that she is purposefully draining the kingdom's finances via Edward under the guise of charity in order to weaken it against an impending invasion.\n\nIris finds herself and her family stuck in the middle of a rivalry over the throne, as there is a vocal faction of people who support Edward's older brother Alfred, who is reported to be traveling to gain more support as well as to avoid assassination by his stepmother, the mother of Edward.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Almeria family, servants, and employees===\n* Iris Lana Almeria: She is the first daughter of the Duke and Prime Minister,  Louis de Armelia. The in-game version of Iris was portrayed as a villain who was sent to a nunnery as a result of her actions. The real version of Iris is shown to be more generous and kind, as she has gone out of her way to rescue several children from dying in abject poverty and giving them jobs as servants in her mansion. Although she has managed to prevent herself from being sent to a nunnery, Iris was still expelled from school and sent to her home fief, where she serves as its acting lord due to her brother's support of Edward's actions. \n* Bern Tashi Almeria: Iris's brother, Bern was a love interest in the otome game. He was present when Edward confronted Iris and supported his actions, going so far as to publicly denounce her as well. These actions cost him much of his parents' respect and as a result Iris is appointed as the acting lord instead of him. He is initially indignant and resentful of his father's actions but comes to respect his sister after witnessing the amount of time and hard work she has put into the job. This, along with a scolding from his father for neglecting his responsibilities, also causes Bern to see Yuri in a different light after she suggests dismantling the military force in order to fund meals for the poor. He then begins to support his sister and family, his love for Yuri destroyed. \n* Duke Louis de Armelia: Iris's father and the Prime Minister. He supports the royal family and gives them advice. He was against Iris marrying Edward because it would give them too much political power and put their family at risk. \n* Merellis Reiser Armelia: Iris's mother, she helps support Iris's business ventures and is a major person of influence and power in social circles. \n* Tanya: Iris's personal maid, she almost starved to death as a child due to her being a poverty-stricken orphan. Due to Iris rescuing her and nursing her back to health, as well as giving her a secure position within the Almeria household, she is completely loyal to her mistress. \n* Lyle: Iris's bodyguard.\n* Dida: Iris's bodyguard.\n* Rehme: Librarian of the Almeria family library. \n* Sebastian: Head butler.\n\n===Royal family===\n* Prince Alfred of Tasmeria/Dean: He is the first prince of Tasmeria. He was not present in the otome game but was mentioned. Some of his supporters want him to ascend the throne, as they view Edward as too much of a liability to trust with that much power. The prince spends much of his time away from the royal capital due to the risk of being assassinated by his step-mother, who views both him and his little sister (who were birthed by the first queen) as a threat to their half-brother Edward's ability to rule. He spends much of his time under the alias of Dean and working for Iris, who he eventually comes to love. \n* Prince Edward of Tasmeria: Iris's former fianc\u00e9, Edward's in-game portrayal is in sharp contrast to his real personality, which is hot-headed and impulsive. This causes many to see him as a poor choice for king, as they believe that he is incapable of making wise decisions for the kingdom. These fears are exacerbated by his relationship with Yuri, as he is blind to the fact that Yuri's spending, along with that of the Queen, has almost completely drained the kingdom's finances. His hatred of Iris is also a factor, as he is willing to alienate and even destroy her duchy to seek retribution, which would have lasting negative repercussions for the entire kingdom and put them at risk. \n* Princess Leticia of Tasmeria: She is Alfred's sister and Edward's half-sister. \n* Queen Ellia Tasmenia: Edward's mother and the step-mother of Alfred and his younger sister Leticia. It is implied in the series that she caused the death of the first queen so she could take her place. \n* Dowager Queen Arya Von Tasmeria: She is the grandmother of Alfred, Edward, and Leticia. She supports Alfred as the next king, as she is unconvinced that Edward would make a wise ruler. The Dowager Queen has an extremely strong political and social presence. \n* King Tasmenia: He is absent for much of the series as he is in poor health.\n\n===Other nobles===\n* Van Lutasha: The son of the current Pope and one of the capturable love interests in the game, Van is infatuated with Yuri. \n* Dorsen Katabelia: The son of the commander of the Royal Guards, Dorsen is another love interests in the game. He is initially infatuated with Yuri but becomes disillusioned with her over time. \n* Yuri Neuer: She is the main character in the game, where she is portrayed as an honest and innocent young lady. In the series this is shown to be an act as she was actually sent by Tasmenia's enemies to serve as a spy and to disrupt the kingdom from the inside so that it could be conquered. She is the illegitimate daughter of a baron and grew up in poverty, which is her reason for disliking the kingdom of Tasmenia and trying to cause its downfall.\n\n==Media==\n===Web novelization===\n''Accomplishments of the Duke's Daughter'' was initially self-published through the novel publishing website [[Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d]].

After losing consciousness and dying, she wakes in another world in the body of Iris, the villain of an [[otome game]] she had been playing before she died. To her shock she discovers that she has reincarnated at the exact moment where Iris's former fiance, Prince Edward, confronts her in front of the entire school over her bullying of Yuri, the daughter of a baron and the game's heroine. Thinking fast, Iris manages to leave the school with her dignity intact and upon returning home, is also able to avoid being sent to a [[nunnery]], the fate of the original Iris. Impressed by her rational thinking, Iris's father Duke Louis de Armelia leaves her in control of the family's [[fief]] in place of her brother Bern, who is one of Edward's supporters and is also in love with Yuri.\n\nAs the series progresses Iris uses her knowledge from her previous life to bring about major, positive changes and products to her fief and the kingdom such as the concept of banking and schooling for commoners who would otherwise not receive an education. She also introduces products that had not previously existed in the kingdom or were only available in a crude format such as chocolate and cosmetics, going so far as to create her own successful business. This brings both positive and negative attention to Iris, her family, and the fief, especially as it angers Prince Edward, who wanted her to be more severely punished. It's also shown that Iris was not responsible for all of the bullying claimed by Yuri, as she had only spread rumors and made negative comments, and that Iris was a far kinder person than the one portrayed in the game's storyline. Furthermore, Yuri's personality is shown to possibly be a facade. It is also hinted that she is a spy sent to disrupt the kingdom and that she is purposefully draining the kingdom's finances via Edward under the guise of charity in order to weaken it against an impending invasion.\n\nIris finds herself and her family stuck in the middle of a rivalry over the throne, as there is a vocal faction of people who support Edward's older brother Alfred, who is reported to be traveling to gain more support as well as to avoid assassination by his stepmother, the mother of Edward.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Almeria family, servants, and employees===\n* Iris Lana Almeria: She is the first daughter of the Duke and Prime Minister,  Louis de Armelia. The in-game version of Iris was portrayed as a villain who was sent to a nunnery as a result of her actions. The real version of Iris is shown to be more generous and kind, as she has gone out of her way to rescue several children from dying in abject poverty and giving them jobs as servants in her mansion. Although she has managed to prevent herself from being sent to a nunnery, Iris was still expelled from school and sent to her home fief, where she serves as its acting lord due to her brother's support of Edward's actions. \n* Bern Tashi Almeria: Iris's brother, Bern was a love interest in the otome game. He was present when Edward confronted Iris and supported his actions, going so far as to publicly denounce her as well. These actions cost him much of his parents' respect and as a result Iris is appointed as the acting lord instead of him. He is initially indignant and resentful of his father's actions but comes to respect his sister after witnessing the amount of time and hard work she has put into the job. This, along with a scolding from his father for neglecting his responsibilities, also causes Bern to see Yuri in a different light after she suggests dismantling the military force in order to fund meals for the poor. He then begins to support his sister and family, his love for Yuri destroyed. \n* Duke Louis de Armelia: Iris's father and the Prime Minister. He supports the royal family and gives them advice. He was against Iris marrying Edward because it would give them too much political power and put their family at risk. \n* Merellis Reiser Armelia: Iris's mother, she helps support Iris's business ventures and is a major person of influence and power in social circles. \n* Tanya: Iris's personal maid, she almost starved to death as a child due to her being a poverty-stricken orphan. Due to Iris rescuing her and nursing her back to health, as well as giving her a secure position within the Almeria household, she is completely loyal to her mistress. \n* Lyle: Iris's bodyguard.\n* Dida: Iris's bodyguard.\n* Rehme: Librarian of the Almeria family library. \n* Sebastian: Head butler.\n\n===Royal family===\n* Prince Alfred of Tasmeria/Dean: He is the first prince of Tasmeria. He was not present in the otome game but was mentioned. Some of his supporters want him to ascend the throne, as they view Edward as too much of a liability to trust with that much power. The prince spends much of his time away from the royal capital due to the risk of being assassinated by his step-mother, who views both him and his little sister (who were birthed by the first queen) as a threat to their half-brother Edward's ability to rule. He spends much of his time under the alias of Dean and working for Iris, who he eventually comes to love. \n* Prince Edward of Tasmeria: Iris's former fiance, Edward's in-game portrayal is in sharp contrast to his real personality, which is hot-headed and impulsive. This causes many to see him as a poor choice for king, as they believe that he is incapable of making wise decisions for the kingdom. These fears are exacerbated by his relationship with Yuri, as he is blind to the fact that Yuri's spending, along with that of the Queen, has almost completely drained the kingdom's finances. His hatred of Iris is also a factor, as he is willing to alienate and even destroy her duchy to seek retribution, which would have lasting negative repercussions for the entire kingdom and put them at risk. \n* Princess Leticia of Tasmeria: She is Alfred's sister and Edward's half-sister. \n* Queen Ellia Tasmenia: Edward's mother and the step-mother of Alfred and his younger sister Leticia. It is implied in the series that she caused the death of the first queen so she could take her place. \n* Dowager Queen Arya Von Tasmeria: She is the grandmother of Alfred, Edward, and Leticia. She supports Alfred as the next king, as she is unconvinced that Edward would make a wise ruler. The Dowager Queen has an extremely strong political and social presence. \n* King Tasmenia: He is absent for much of the series as he is in poor health.\n\n===Other nobles===\n* Van Lutasha: The son of the current Pope and one of the capturable love interests in the game, Van is infatuated with Yuri. \n* Dorsen Katabelia: The son of the commander of the Royal Guards, Dorsen is another love interests in the game. He is initially infatuated with Yuri but becomes disillusioned with her over time. \n* Yuri Neuer: She is the main character in the game, where she is portrayed as an honest and innocent young lady. In the series this is shown to be an act as she was actually sent by Tasmenia's enemies to serve as a spy and to disrupt the kingdom from the inside so that it could be conquered. She is the illegitimate daughter of a baron and grew up in poverty, which is her reason for disliking the kingdom of Tasmenia and trying to cause its downfall.\n\n==Media==\n===Web novelization===\n''Accomplishments of the Duke's Daughter'' was initially self-published through the novel publishing website [[Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d]].
