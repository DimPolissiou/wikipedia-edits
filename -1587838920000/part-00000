It is a member of the long-necked lute family, with a round body with a flat top and a long neck with a fretted fingerboard. It has steel strings and is played with a [[plectrum]] producing a sharp metallic sound, reminiscent of a [[mandolin]] but pitched lower. There are two main types of bouzouki: the ''trichordo'' (''three-course'') has three pairs of strings (known as courses) and the ''tetrachordo'' (''four-course'') has four pairs of strings. The instrument was brought to Greece in the [[1900s (decade)|1900s]] by [[Greeks|Greek]] immigrants from [[Turkey]], and quickly became the central instrument to the [[rebetiko]] genre and its music branches.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bouzouki|url=http://www.foundationhellenicculture.com/music|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209203513/http://www.foundationhellenicculture.com/music|archivedate=2012-02-09}}</ref> It is now an important element of modern [[Greek music]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''bouzouki'' comes from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word {{lang|tr|bozuk}}, meaning \"broken\" or \"modified\",<ref>''Musical Traditions'', Issues 2\u20134, 1984, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6CLaAAAAMAAJ&q=bouzouk+broken+turkish+music&dq=bouzouk+broken+turkish+music&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I1eWUubCDNTMsATMhIHIAQ&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg p. 19]</ref> and comes from a particular [[Reentrant tuning|re-entrant tuning]] called {{lang|tr|bozuk d\u00fczen}}, which was commonly used on its Turkish counterpart, the {{lang|tr|saz-bozuk}}. It is in the same instrumental family as the [[mandolin]] and the [[lute]]. Originally the body was carved from a solid block of wood, similar to the [[Saz (musical instrument)|saz]], but upon its arrival in Greece in the early 1910s it was modified by the addition of a staved back borrowed from the Neapolitan mandola, and the top angled in the manner of a Neapolitan mandolins so as to increase the strength of the body to withstand thicker steel strings. The type of the instrument used in Rembetika music was a three-course instrument with three pairs of strings, but in the 1950s a four-course variety was developed and was made popular by [[Manolis Chiotis]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bouzouki name origin|url=http://www.foundationhellenicculture.com/music|access-date=2012-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209203513/http://www.foundationhellenicculture.com/music|archive-date=2012-02-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Construction ==\n[[image:DSC 3510 athens Bouzouki player street july 2018.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bouzouki player in [[Athens]], July 2018]]\nFrom a construction point of view, the bouzouki can have differences not only in the number of strings but also in other features, e.g. neck length, width, height, depth of the bowl or main body, the width of the staves (the wooden [[Gore (segment)|gores]] or slices of the bowl) etc. These differences are determined by the manufacturer, who in his experience and according to the sound that the instrument should make, modifies his functional elements to achieve a more piercing, deeper or heavier sound.\n\nThe size and type of the resonating body largely determine the instrument's timbre, while the length of the neck, and by extension the strings, determines the instrument's pitch range, as well as influencing the timbre. While neck length can vary from instrument to instrument, most bouzoukis have the same number of frets (27), spaced such as to provide a chromatic scale in 12-tone equal temperament.  On modern instruments the frets are metal, and set into fixed position in the fingerboard (in contrast to early instruments and the related baglama, in which frets were of gut or cord tied onto the neck, and moveable.) The quality of the wood from which the instrument is made is of great importance to the sound. For the construction of the bowl, mulberry, apricot, cherry, acacia, and elm are considered to be the best woods with walnut, plane, and chestnut being slightly inferior. The wood must be solid and sourced from slow growth trees. The top or soundboard should be cedar or spruce (preferably spruce) if possible, cut in one piece.

In the two lower-pitched ([[Bass (sound)|bass]]) courses, the pair consists of a thick wound string and a thin string tuned an [[octave]] apart. On the bouzouki the lower-pitched string comes first in these courses, the reverse of most other instruments with octave-paired courses (such as the [[12-string guitar]], [[charango]] or [[bajo sexto]]). These 'octave strings' add to the fullness of the sound and are used in chords and bass drones (continuous low notes that are played throughout the music). The guitar-like tuning was introduced by composer and soloist [[Manolis Hiotis]], who found it better suited to the kind of virtuoso playing he was famous for. Today, the tetrachordo is the most common bouzouki used in Greek music, though a few traditionalists still prefer the trichordo, particularly for the older ''rebetika'' style of playing.<ref>[https://cliojournal.wikispaces.com/A+History+of+the+Bouzouki+and+its+Music  A History of the Bouzouki and Its Music]</ref>\n\n==Amplification==\nIn addition to developing the modern tetrachordo bouzouki, Manolis Hiotis was a pioneer the use of amplification for the instrument, which he may have been using as early as 1945.<ref>Shorelis, Tasos; \"''Rebetiki anthologia''\"; Athens: ''Plethron''; 1981:4, pp. 179\u2013180.</ref> However, the earliest documented use of amplification for the bouzouki comes from a 1952 photograph, showing Vasilis Tsitsanis and Yiannis Papaioannou playing bouzoukis, each with an electric guitar-style pick-up attached in the soundhole.  There are also numerous photographs between 1953 and 1959 showing bands in which both vocalists and bouzouki players are using microphones for amplification.<ref name=\"Petropoulos\">Petropoulos, Ilias; ''Rebetika tragoudia'', 2nd ed.; Athens: Kedros, 1979. p. 488.</ref>  By 1960 special bouzouki pickups (such as the [[Germany|German]] \"Ideal\") were being produced and permanently mounted in the instruments.<ref name=\"Petropoulos\"/><ref>Gauntlett, Stathis; ''Folklore and populism: The 'greening' of the Greek blues''; in Margaret Clarke (ed.), ''Proceedings of the Fourth National Folk Conference'': 1991a. pp. 86-91.,</ref><ref>Gauntlett, Stathis; \"Orpheus in the criminal underworld.

It is a member of the long-necked lute family, with a round body with a flat top and a long neck with a fretted fingerboard. It has steel strings and is played with a [[plectrum]] producing a sharp metallic sound, reminiscent of a [[mandolin]] but pitched lower. There are two main types of bouzouki: the ''trichordo'' (''three-course'') has three pairs of strings (known as courses) and the ''tetrachordo'' (''four-course'') has four pairs of strings. The instrument was brought to Greece in the [[1900s (decade)|1900s]] by [[Greeks|Greek]] immigrants from [[Turkey]], and quickly became the central instrument to the [[rebetiko]] genre and its music branches.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bouzouki|url=http://www.foundationhellenicculture.com/music|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209203513/http://www.foundationhellenicculture.com/music|archivedate=2012-02-09}}</ref> It is now an important element of modern [[Greek music]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''bouzouki'' comes from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word {{lang|tr|bozuk}}, meaning \"broken\" or \"modified\",<ref>''Musical Traditions'', Issues 2\u20134, 1984, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6CLaAAAAMAAJ&q=bouzouk+broken+turkish+music&dq=bouzouk+broken+turkish+music&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I1eWUubCDNTMsATMhIHIAQ&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg p. 19]</ref> and comes from a particular [[Reentrant tuning|re-entrant tuning]] called {{lang|tr|bozuk d\u00fczen}}, which was commonly used on its Turkish counterpart, the {{lang|tr|saz-bozuk}}. It is in the same instrumental family as the [[mandolin]] and the [[lute]]. Originally the body was carved from a solid block of wood, similar to the [[Saz (musical instrument)|saz]], but upon its arrival in Greece in the early 1910s it was modified by the addition of a staved back borrowed from the Neapolitan mandola, and the top angled in the manner of a Neapolitan mandolins so as to increase the strength of the body to withstand thicker steel strings. The type of the instrument used in Rembetika music was a three-course instrument with three pairs of strings, but in the 1950s a four-course variety was developed and was made popular by [[Manolis Chiotis]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bouzouki name origin|url=http://www.foundationhellenicculture.com/music|access-date=2012-02-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209203513/http://www.foundationhellenicculture.com/music|archive-date=2012-02-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Construction ==\n[[image:DSC 3510 athens Bouzouki player street july 2018.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bouzouki player in [[Athens]], July 2018]]\nFrom a construction point of view, the bouzouki can have differences not only in the number of strings but also in other features, e.g. neck length, width, height, depth of the bowl or main body, the width of the staves (the wooden [[Gore (segment)|gores]] or slices of the bowl) etc. These differences are determined by the manufacturer, who in his experience and according to the sound that the instrument should make, modifies his functional elements to achieve a more piercing, deeper or heavier sound.\n\nThe size and type of the resonating body largely determine the instrument's timbre, while the length of the neck, and by extension the strings, determines the instrument's pitch range, as well as influencing the timbre. While neck length can vary from instrument to instrument, most bouzoukis have the same number of frets (27), spaced such as to provide a chromatic scale in 12-tone equal temperament.  On modern instruments the frets are metal, and set into fixed position in the fingerboard (in contrast to early instruments and the related baglama, in which frets were of gut or cord tied onto the neck, and moveable.) The quality of the wood from which the instrument is made is of great importance to the sound. For the construction of the bowl, mulberry, apricot, cherry, acacia, and elm are considered to be the best woods with walnut, plane, and chestnut being slightly inferior. The wood must be solid and sourced from slow growth trees. The top or soundboard should be cedar or spruce (preferably spruce) if possible, cut in one piece. The top plays a major role in the sound because it resonates and strengthens and prolongs the vibration of the strings. Another factor that affects the quality of the sound is the varnish and the method of its application. The best varnish is a natural one made of [[shellac]], which is applied by hand in many layers in the traditional way, for both acoustic and visual effect. The neck must be of very dry hardwood in order not to warp and increase the distance of the strings from the fret board (the action height) which makes playing the instrument more laborious. To achieve this, manufacturers use different techniques, each one having their own secrets. Many modern instrument have a metal rod or bar (truss-rod) set into a channel in the neck, under the fingerboard, which adds some weight, but increases rigidity, and allows adjustment of the neck should it begin to warp.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Lute#History and evolution of the lute}}\n[[Image:Bouzoukis.jpg|left|thumb|210px|Bouzouki in the [[Museum of Greek Folk Musical Instruments]] in [[Athens]]]]\nThe Greek bouzouki is a plucked musical instrument of the lute family, called the [[thaboura]]s or tambouras family.

Today, the tetrachordo is the most common bouzouki used in Greek music, though a few traditionalists still prefer the trichordo, particularly for the older ''rebetika'' style of playing.<ref>[https://cliojournal.wikispaces.com/A+History+of+the+Bouzouki+and+its+Music  A History of the Bouzouki and Its Music]</ref>\n\n==Amplification==\nIn addition to developing the modern tetrachordo bouzouki, Manolis Hiotis was a pioneer the use of amplification for the instrument, which he may have been using as early as 1945.<ref>Shorelis, Tasos; \"''Rebetiki anthologia''\"; Athens: ''Plethron''; 1981:4, pp. 179\u2013180.</ref> However, the earliest documented use of amplification for the bouzouki comes from a 1952 photograph, showing Vasilis Tsitsanis and Yiannis Papaioannou playing bouzoukis, each with an electric guitar-style pick-up attached in the soundhole.  There are also numerous photographs between 1953 and 1959 showing bands in which both vocalists and bouzouki players are using microphones for amplification.<ref name=\"Petropoulos\">Petropoulos, Ilias; ''Rebetika tragoudia'', 2nd ed.; Athens: Kedros, 1979. p. 488.</ref>  By 1960 special bouzouki pickups (such as the [[Germany|German]] \"Ideal\") were being produced and permanently mounted in the instruments.<ref name=\"Petropoulos\"/><ref>Gauntlett, Stathis; ''Folklore and populism: The 'greening' of the Greek blues''; in Margaret Clarke (ed.), ''Proceedings of the Fourth National Folk Conference'': 1991a. pp. 86-91.,</ref><ref>Gauntlett, Stathis; \"Orpheus in the criminal underworld.

It is tuned the same as the trichordo bouzouki but pitched an octave higher (nominally D\u2013A\u2013D), with unison pairs on the four highest strings and an octave pair on the lower D. Musically, the baglamas is most often found supporting the bouzouki in the [[Piraeus]] style of [[rebetika]].\n* [[Irish bouzouki]]\n* [[Lute]]\n* [[Mandolin]]\n* [[Pandura]]\n* [[Tambura (instrument)|Tambura]]\n* [[Ba\u011flama]]\n* [[\u0160argija|Shargia]]\n\n==Notable players==<!--Linked from 'Music of Greece'-->\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*[[Angelo Avramakis]]\n*[[Manolis Chiotis]]\n*[[Anestis Delias]]\n*[[Alec Finn]]\n*[[Dimitris Gogos]]\n*[[Colin Meloy]]\n*[[Giannis Papaioannou]]\n*[[Spyros Peristeris]]\n*[[Giannis Tatasopoulos]]\n*[[Vangelis Trigas]]\n*[[Babis Tsertos]]\n*[[Vassilis Tsitsanis]]\n*[[Markos Vamvakaris]]\n*[[Nikos Vrachnas]]\n*[[Giorgos Zambetas]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Greek music]]\n*[[Celtic music]]\n*[[Greek folk music]]\n*[[Irish folk music]]\n*[[Laouto]], another Greek lute\n*[[Stringed instrument tunings]]\n*[[Rebetiko]]\n*[[Laiko]]\n*[[Tzouras]]\n*[[Lute]]\n*[[Mandolin]]\n*[[Octave mandolin|Octave Mandolin]]\n*[[Mandola]]\n*[[Cittern]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book\n | title = The Greek Bouzouki Chord Bible: CFAD Standard Tuning 1,728 Chords\n | first = Tobe A.\n | last = Richards\n | location = United Kingdom\n | publisher = Cabot Books\n | year = 2007\n | isbn = 978-0-9553944-8-5\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | title = Brief History of Bouzouki Instrument in Greek Language\n | first = Dimitrios\n | last =  Stathakopoulos\n | edition = Greek\n | location = New York\n | publisher = Seaburn Books\n | year = 2014\n | isbn = 1592325173\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | title = Markos Vamvakaris: The Man and the Bouzouki\n | first = Markos\n | last = Vamvakaris\n | location = \n | publisher = greeklines.com\n | year = 2015\n | isbn = 0993263305\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons category inline|Bouzoukis}}\n*[https://www.britannica.com/art/bouzouki Greek Bouzouki musical instrument] at britannica.com\n\n{{Greek musical instruments}}{{Celtic music}}\n[[Category:Greek musical instruments]]\n[[Category:Cypriot musical instruments]]\n[[Category:String instruments]]\n[[Category:Necked bowl lutes]]\n[[Category:Greek inventions]]\n[[Category:Turkish words and phrases]]\n", "name_user": "Greco22", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouzouki"}

It premiered on the [[NBC]] [[Television Network]] on October 11, 1975, under the title ''NBC's Saturday Night''. The show often satirizes contemporary American popular culture and politics. ''Saturday Night Live'' features a two-tiered cast: the repertory members, also known as the \"Not Ready for Prime-Time Players,\" and newer cast members, known as \"Featured Players.\" Each week, the show features a host, often a well-known celebrity, who delivers an opening [[monologue]] and performs in sketches with the cast. A musical guest is also invited to perform several sets (usually two, occasionally more). Every so often a host or musical guest fills both roles. With the exception of [[Saturday Night Live (season 7)|season 7]] and several other rare cases, the show begins with a [[cold open]] that ends with someone's [[breaking character]] and proclaiming \"[[Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!]]\"\n\n''Saturday Night Live'' is one of the [[List of longest running United States television series|longest running]] network programs in American television history, with more than 800 episodes broadcast over five [[Timeline_of_the_20th_century|decade]]s. A number of the show's sketches have been developed into [[feature film]]s, including ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', ''[[Wayne's World]]'', ''[[A Night at the Roxbury]]'', ''[[Superstar (1999 film)|Superstar]]'', ''[[Coneheads]]'', and ''[[MacGruber (film)|MacGruber]]''.\n\nSeasons 1 through 5 are [[List of Saturday Night Live DVD releases|available on DVD]] in [[DVD region code#1|Region{{nbsp}}1]]. Various ''Saturday Night Live'' sketches are available in several [[new media]] formats, including [[streaming media|streaming]] on [[Hulu]] and [[Netflix]]. A number of sketches are available to view via the show's official [[YouTube]] channel, along with best-of compilations for sale through digital video retailers.\n\n{|id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"

It premiered on the [[NBC]] [[Television Network]] on October 11, 1975, under the title ''NBC's Saturday Night''. The show often satirizes contemporary American popular culture and politics. ''Saturday Night Live'' features a two-tiered cast: the repertory members, also known as the \"Not Ready for Prime-Time Players,\" and newer cast members, known as \"Featured Players.\" Each week, the show features a host, often a well-known celebrity, who delivers an opening [[monologue]] and performs in sketches with the cast. A musical guest is also invited to perform several sets (usually two, occasionally more). Every so often a host or musical guest fills both roles. With the exception of [[Saturday Night Live (season 7)|season 7]] and several other rare cases, the show begins with a [[cold open]] that ends with someone's [[breaking character]] and proclaiming \"[[Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!]]\"\n\n''Saturday Night Live'' is one of the [[List of longest running United States television series|longest running]] network programs in American television history, with more than 800 episodes broadcast over five [[Timeline_of_the_20th_century|decade]]s. A number of the show's sketches have been developed into [[feature film]]s, including ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'', ''[[Wayne's World]]'', ''[[A Night at the Roxbury]]'', ''[[Superstar (1999 film)|Superstar]]'', ''[[Coneheads]]'', and ''[[MacGruber (film)|MacGruber]]''.\n\nSeasons 1 through 5 are [[List of Saturday Night Live DVD releases|available on DVD]] in [[DVD region code#1|Region{{nbsp}}1]]. Various ''Saturday Night Live'' sketches are available in several [[new media]] formats, including [[streaming media|streaming]] on [[Hulu]] and [[Netflix]]. A number of sketches are available to view via the show's official [[YouTube]] channel, along with best-of compilations for sale through digital video retailers.\n\n{|id=\"toc\" class=\"toc\"

Term \"chastushki\" was first used by [[Gleb Uspensky]] in his book about Russian folk rhymes published 1889. Usually many chastushki are sung one after another. Chastushki make use of a simple [[rhyme|rhyming]] scheme to convey [[humor]]ous or [[irony|ironic]] content. The singing and recitation of such rhymes were an important part of [[peasant]] [[popular culture]] both before and after the [[Bolshevik Revolution of 1917]].\n\n==Form==\n\nA chastushka (plural: chastushki) is a simple rhyming poem which would be characterized derisively in English as [[doggerel]]. The name originates from the Russian word \"\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\" (\"chasto\") \u2013 \"frequently\", or from ''\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0301\u0442\u044c'' (\"chastit\"), meaning  \"to do something with high frequency\" and probably refers to high [[Beat (music)|beat]] frequency of chastushkas.\n\nThe basic form is a simple four-line [[quatrain|verse]] making use of an ''ABAB'', ''ABCB,'' or ''AABB'' [[rhyme scheme]].\n\nUsually humorous, [[satire|satirical]], or ironic in nature, chastushki are often put to music as well, usually with [[balalaika]] or [[accordion]] accompaniment. The rigid, short structure (and, to a lesser degree, the type of humor used) parallels the poetic genre of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]] in British culture.\n\nSometimes several chastushki are delivered in sequence to form a song. After each chastushka, there is a full musical refrain without lyrics to give the listeners a chance to laugh without missing the next one. Originally chastushki were a form of folk entertainment, not intended to be performed on stage. Often they are sung in turns by a group of people. Sometimes they are used as a medium for a back-and-forth mocking contest. Improvisation is highly valued during chastuska singing.\n\n==Content==\n\nChastushki cover a very wide spectrum of topics, from lewd jokes to political satire, including such diverse themes as love songs and Communist [[propaganda]].\n\nFollowing the [[1917 Russian Revolution]], chastushki varied considerably in content from region to region. In some areas hit particularly hard by the [[Prodrazvyorstka|grain requisitioning]] of the Soviet regime during the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], such as [[Riazan]], peasant chastushki tended to be bitterly hostile.<ref name=\"Fitz28\">Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''Stalin's Peasants: Resistance and Survival in the Russian Village After Collectivization.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1994; pg. 28.</ref> In other places, particularly those in close proximity to [[Moscow]] under Stalin's leadership, \"Soviet chastushki\" favorable to Stalin's [[Bolshevik]] government were sung and recited.<ref name=\"Fitz28\" />\n\nIn the early 1920s chastushki were used by [[Komsomol|Young Communists]] in organized village gatherings as a form of anti-religious [[propaganda]], subjecting the church and the rural clergy to ridicule using the traditional rural poetic form.<ref name=\"Viola50\">Lynne Viola, ''Peasant Rebels Under Stalin: Collectivization and the Culture of Peasant Resistance.''

Term \"chastushki\" was first used by [[Gleb Uspensky]] in his book about Russian folk rhymes published 1889. Usually many chastushki are sung one after another. Chastushki make use of a simple [[rhyme|rhyming]] scheme to convey [[humor]]ous or [[irony|ironic]] content. The singing and recitation of such rhymes were an important part of [[peasant]] [[popular culture]] both before and after the [[Bolshevik Revolution of 1917]].\n\n==Form==\n\nA chastushka (plural: chastushki) is a simple rhyming poem which would be characterized derisively in English as [[doggerel]]. The name originates from the Russian word \"\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\" (\"chasto\") \u2013 \"frequently\", or from ''\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0301\u0442\u044c'' (\"chastit\"), meaning  \"to do something with high frequency\" and probably refers to high [[Beat (music)|beat]] frequency of chastushkas.\n\nThe basic form is a simple four-line [[quatrain|verse]] making use of an ''ABAB'', ''ABCB,'' or ''AABB'' [[rhyme scheme]].\n\nUsually humorous, [[satire|satirical]], or ironic in nature, chastushki are often put to music as well, usually with [[balalaika]] or [[accordion]] accompaniment. The rigid, short structure (and, to a lesser degree, the type of humor used) parallels the poetic genre of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]] in British culture.\n\nSometimes several chastushki are delivered in sequence to form a song. After each chastuska, there is a full musical refrain without lyrics to give the listeners a chance to laugh without missing the next one. Originally chastushki were a form of folk entertainment, not intended to be performed on stage. Often they are sung in turns by a group of people. Sometimes they are used as a medium for a back-and-forth mocking contest. Improvisation is highly valued during chastuska singing.\n\n==Content==\n\nChastushki cover a very wide spectrum of topics, from lewd jokes to political satire, including such diverse themes as love songs and Communist [[propaganda]].\n\nFollowing the [[1917 Russian Revolution]], chastushki varied considerably in content from region to region. In some areas hit particularly hard by the [[Prodrazvyorstka|grain requisitioning]] of the Soviet regime during the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], such as [[Riazan]], peasant chastushki tended to be bitterly hostile.<ref name=\"Fitz28\">Sheila Fitzpatrick, ''Stalin's Peasants: Resistance and Survival in the Russian Village After Collectivization.''
