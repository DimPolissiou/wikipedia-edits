In many cases, the incremental effort in some projects can lead to significant financial loss. One of the important factors is the right choice of technology for the project, as this determines further work. \n\n===Business process and system design===\n\nThe scope of a project is linked intimately to the proposed business processes and systems that the project is going to deliver. Regardless of whether the project is to launch a new product range or discontinue unprofitable parts of the business, the change will have some impact on business processes and systems. The documentation of your business processes and system requirements are as fundamental to project scoping as an architects plans would be to the costing and scoping of the construction of a building.\n\n===Project management support===\n\nThe most successful business projects are always those that are driven by an employee who has the authority, vision and influence to drive the required changes in a business. It is highly unlikely that a business owner (decision maker or similar) will realize the changes unless one has one of these people in the employment. However, the project leadership role typically requires significant experience and skills which are not usually found within a company focused on day-to-day operations.  Due to this requirement within more significant business change projects/programs, outside expertise is often sought from firms which can bring this specific skill set to the company.\n\n==IT consulting skills==\n\nAn IT consultant needs to possess the following skills:\n\n* Advisory skills\n* Technical skills\n* Business skills\n* [[Communication skills]]\n* Management skills\n* Advisory language skills\n* Business and management language skills\n* Technical language skills\n\n==Consulting fees==\nUnder normal circumstances a fee for IT consulting is measured on a per day, per consultant basis. There is however an alternative option; fixed fee IT consulting. A fixed fee IT consulting contract applies only to projects which are well defined, for example:\n\n*Infrastructure refreshment projects\n*[[Network design]]\n*Implementation of specific well described features, such as monitoring platforms\n*Infrastructure capacity planning\n\nGenerally, fixed fee IT consulting is for a specific amount of work, within a defined timeframe.\n\nMany companies are now moving towards a fixed priced IT consulting model.\n\nThis trend is expected to continue as more companies now require delivery of IT Consulting services within a defined time and price structure.\n\nOpen ended consultancy models generally favour the consulting firm, as the consultancy firm is rewarded on a per day basis, there is no incentive to complete assignments within a fixed time. The result often being risk of project and cost overrun.\n\n==Management consulting and IT consulting==\nThere is a relatively unclear line between [[management consulting]] and IT consulting. There are sometimes overlaps between the two fields, but IT consultants often have degrees in [[computer science]], [[electronics]], [[technology]], or [[management information systems]] while management consultants often have degrees in [[accounting]], [[economics]], [[Industrial Engineering]], [[finance]], or a generalized [[MBA]] (Masters in Business Administration).\n\nAccording to the Institute for Partner Education & Development, IT consultants' revenues come predominantly from design and planning based consulting with a mixture of IT and business consulting.
