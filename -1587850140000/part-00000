Treatment is tailored towards the symptoms of the individual. Therapies for lissencephaly are to deal with the symptoms as the syndrome is congenital. Supportive care may be needed to help with comfort and nursing needs. Seizures may be controlled with medication and hydrocephalus may require shunting. If feeding becomes difficult, a [[gastrostomy]] tube may be considered.\n\nThere are a number of organisations that raise awareness and funding for rare diseases such as lissencephaly. They also seek to increase the quality of life for individuals living with related disabilities. In the United States, these organisation include [[Arc of the United States]], [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]], and [[March of Dimes]].\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe prognosis for children with lissencephaly varies depending on the malformation and severity of the syndrome. Many individuals remain in a 3\u20135 month developmental level. Life expectancy is short and many children with lissencephaly will die before the age of 10. Some children with lissencephaly will be able to roll over, sit, reach for objects, and smile socially.

Treatment is tailored towards the symptoms of the individual. Therapies for lissencephaly are to deal with the symptoms as the syndrome is congenital. Supportive care may be needed to help with comfort and nursing needs. Seizures may be controlled with medication and hydrocephalus may require shunting. If feeding becomes difficult, a [[gastrostomy]] tube may be considered.\n\nThere are a number of organisations that raise awareness and funding for rare diseases such as lissencephaly. They also seek to increase the quality of life for individuals living with related disabilities. In the United States, these organisation include [[Arc of the United States]], [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]], and [[March of Dimes]].\n\n==Prognosis==\nThe prognosis for children with lissencephaly varies depending on the malformation and severity of the syndrome. Many individuals remain in a 3\u20135 month developmental level. Life expectancy is short and many children with lissencephaly will die before the age of 10. Some children with lissencephaly will be able to roll over, sit, reach for objects, and smile socially.

Most applications fall into one of the following two broad categories:\n* If the goal is prediction, forecasting, or error reduction,{{clarify|date=May 2018|reason=\"error reduction\" in what sense?}} linear regression can be used to fit a predictive model to an observed [[data set]] of values of the response and explanatory variables. After developing such a model, if additional values of the explanatory variables are collected without an accompanying response value, the fitted model can be used to make a prediction of the response.\n* If the goal is to explain variation in the response variable that can be attributed to variation in the explanatory variables, linear regression analysis can be applied to quantify the strength of the relationship between the response and the explanatory variables, and in particular to determine whether some explanatory variables may have no linear relationship with the response at all, or to identify which subsets of explanatory variables may contain redundant information about the response.\n\nLinear regression models are often fitted using the [[least squares]] approach, but they may also be fitted in other ways, such as by minimizing the \"lack of fit\" in some other [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] (as with [[least absolute deviations]] regression), or by minimizing a penalized version of the least squares [[Loss function|cost function]] as in [[ridge regression]] (''L''<sup>2</sup>-norm penalty) and [[Lasso (statistics)|lasso]] (''L''<sup>1</sup>-norm penalty). Conversely, the least squares approach can be used to fit models that are not linear models. Thus, although the terms \"least squares\" and \"linear model\" are closely linked, they are not synonymous.\n\n== Introduction ==\n[[File:Linear least squares example2.png|thumb|In linear regression, the observations (<span style=\"color:red\">'''red'''</span>) are assumed to be the result of random deviations (<span style=\"color:green\">'''green'''</span>) from an underlying relationship (<span style=\"color:blue;\">'''blue'''</span>) between a dependent variable (''y'') and an independent variable (''x'').]]\n\nGiven a [[data]] set <math>\\{y_i,\\, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ip}\\}_{i=1}^n</math> of ''n'' [[statistical unit]]s, a linear regression model assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable ''y'' and the [[Multivector|''p''-vector]] of regressors '''x''' is [[linear function|linear]]. This relationship is modeled through a ''disturbance term'' or ''error variable'' ''\u03b5'' \u2014 an unobserved [[random variable]] that adds \"noise\" to the linear relationship between the dependent variable and regressors. Thus the model takes the form\n: <math>\n y_i = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{i1} + \\cdots + \\beta_{p} x_{ip} + \\varepsilon_i\n = \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_i\\boldsymbol\\beta + \\varepsilon_i,\n \\qquad i = 1, \\ldots, n,\n </math>\nwhere <sup>T</sup> denotes the [[transpose]], so that '''x'''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>T</sup>'''''\u03b2''''' is the [[inner product]] between [[coordinate vector|vectors]] '''x'''<sub>''i''</sub> and '''''\u03b2'''''.\n\nOften these ''n'' equations are stacked together and written in [[matrix notation]] as\n: <math>\n \\mathbf{y} = X\\boldsymbol\\beta + \\boldsymbol\\varepsilon, \\,\n </math>\nwhere\n: <math>\n \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n</math>\n\n: <math>\n X = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_n \\end{pmatrix}\n = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &  x_{11} & \\cdots & x_{1p} \\\\\n 1 & x_{21} & \\cdots & x_{2p} \\\\\n \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n 1 & x_{n1} & \\cdots & x_{np}\n \\end{pmatrix}, \n</math>\n\n: <math>\n \\boldsymbol\\beta = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_p \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n \\boldsymbol\\varepsilon = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_1 \\\\ \\varepsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\varepsilon_n \\end{pmatrix}.\n </math>\nSome remarks on notation and terminology:\n* <math>\\mathbf{y}</math> is a vector of observed values <math>y_i\\ (i=1,\\ldots,n)</math> of the variable called the ''regressand'', ''endogenous variable'', ''response variable'', ''measured variable'', ''criterion variable'', or ''[[dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]]''. This variable is also sometimes known as the ''predicted variable'', but this should not be confused with ''predicted values'', which are denoted <math>\\hat{y}</math>. The decision as to which variable in a data set is modeled as the dependent variable and which are modeled as the independent variables may be based on a presumption that the value of one of the variables is caused by, or directly influenced by the other variables. Alternatively, there may be an operational reason to model one of the variables in terms of the others, in which case there need be no presumption of causality.\n* <math>X</math> may be seen as a matrix of row-vectors <math>\\mathbf{x}_i</math> or of ''n''-dimensional column-vectors <math>X_j</math>, which are known as ''regressors'', ''exogenous variables'', ''explanatory variables'', ''covariates'', ''input variables'', ''predictor variables'', or ''[[dependent and independent variables|independent variables]]'' (not to be confused with the concept of [[independent random variables]]). The matrix <math>X</math> is sometimes called the [[design matrix]].\n** {{anchor|Intercept}}Usually a constant is included as one of the regressors. In particular, <math>\\mathbf{x}_{i0}=1</math> for <math>i=1,\\ldots,n</math>. The corresponding element of '''''\u03b2''''' is called the ''[[Y-intercept|intercept]]''. Many statistical inference procedures for linear models require an intercept to be present, so it is often included even if theoretical considerations suggest that its value should be zero.\n** Sometimes one of the regressors can be a non-linear function of another regressor or of the data, as in [[polynomial regression]] and [[segmented regression]]. The model remains linear as long as it is linear in the parameter vector '''''\u03b2'''''.\n** The values ''x''<sub>''ij''</sub> may be viewed as either observed values of [[random variable]]s ''X''<sub>''j''</sub> or as fixed values chosen prior to observing the dependent variable. Both interpretations may be appropriate in different cases, and they generally lead to the same estimation procedures; however different approaches to asymptotic analysis are used in these two situations.\n* <math>\\boldsymbol\\beta</math> is a <math>(p+1)</math>-dimensional ''parameter vector'', where <math>\\beta_0</math> is the intercept term (if one is included in the model\u2014otherwise <math>\\boldsymbol\\beta</math> is ''p''-dimensional). Its elements are known as ''effects'' or ''regression coefficients'' (although the latter term is sometimes reserved for the ''estimated'' effects). Statistical [[estimation theory|estimation]] and [[statistical inference|inference]] in linear regression focuses on '''''\u03b2'''''. The elements of this parameter vector are interpreted as the [[partial derivative]]s of the dependent variable with respect to the various independent variables.\n* <math>\\boldsymbol\\varepsilon</math> is a vector of values <math>\\varepsilon_i</math>. This part of the model is called the ''error term'', ''disturbance term'', or sometimes ''noise'' (in contrast with the \"signal\" provided by the rest of the model). This variable captures all other factors which influence the dependent variable ''y'' other than the regressors '''x'''. The relationship between the error term and the regressors, for example their [[correlation]], is a crucial consideration in formulating a linear regression model, as it will determine the appropriate estimation method.\n\n'''Example'''.<!-- this example is referred to again below, so check the rest of article if you make substantive changes here --> Consider a situation where a small ball is being tossed up in the air and then we measure its heights of ascent ''h<sub>i</sub>'' at various moments in time ''t<sub>i</sub>''.

Linear regression can be used to estimate the values of ''\u03b2''<sub>1</sub> and ''\u03b2''<sub>2</sub> from the measured data.

Numerous extensions have been developed that allow each of these assumptions to be relaxed (i.e. reduced to a weaker form), and in some cases eliminated entirely. Generally these extensions make the estimation procedure more complex and time-consuming, and may also require more data in order to produce an equally precise model.\n\n[[Image:Polyreg scheffe.svg|thumb|325px|Example of a cubic polynomial regression, which is a type of linear regression.]]\nThe following are the major assumptions made by standard linear regression models with standard estimation techniques (e.g. [[ordinary least squares]]):\n\n*'''Weak exogeneity'''.  This essentially means that the predictor variables ''x'' can be treated as fixed values, rather than [[random variable]]s.  This means, for example, that the predictor variables are assumed to be error-free\u2014that is, not contaminated with measurement errors. Although this assumption is not realistic in many settings, dropping it leads to significantly more difficult [[errors-in-variables model]]s.\n*'''Linearity'''.  This means that the mean of the response variable is a [[linear combination]] of the parameters (regression coefficients) and the predictor variables.  Note that this assumption is much less restrictive than it may at first seem.  Because the predictor variables are treated as fixed values (see above), linearity is really only a restriction on the parameters.  The predictor variables themselves can be arbitrarily transformed, and in fact multiple copies of the same underlying predictor variable can be added, each one transformed differently.  This technique is used, for example, in [[polynomial regression]], which uses linear regression to fit the response variable as an arbitrary [[polynomial]] function (up to a given rank) of a predictor variable. This makes linear regression an extremely powerful inference method.  In fact, models such as polynomial regression are often \"too powerful\", in that they tend to [[overfit]] the data.  As a result, some kind of [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] must typically be used to prevent unreasonable solutions coming out of the estimation process.  Common examples are [[ridge regression]] and [[lasso regression]].  [[Bayesian linear regression]] can also be used, which by its nature is more or less immune to the problem of overfitting. (In fact, [[ridge regression]] and [[lasso regression]] can both be viewed as    special cases of Bayesian linear regression, with particular types of [[prior distribution]]s placed on the regression coefficients.)\n*'''Constant variance''' (a.k.a. '''[[homoscedasticity]]''').  This means that different values of the response variable have the same [[variance]] in their errors, regardless of the values of the predictor variables. In practice this assumption is invalid (i.e. the errors are [[heteroscedasticity|heteroscedastic]]) if the response variable can vary over a wide scale. In order to check for heterogeneous error variance, or when a pattern of residuals violates model assumptions of homoscedasticity (error is equally variable around the 'best-fitting line' for all points of x), it is prudent to look for a \"fanning effect\" between residual error and predicted values. This is to say there will be a systematic change in the absolute or squared residuals when plotted against the predictive variables. Errors will not be evenly distributed across the regression line. Heteroscedasticity will result in the averaging over of distinguishable variances around the points to get a single variance that is inaccurately representing all the variances of the line. In effect, residuals appear clustered and spread apart on their predicted plots for larger and smaller values for points along the linear regression line, and the mean squared error for the model will be wrong. Typically, for example, a response variable whose mean is large will have a greater variance than one whose mean is small. For example, a given person whose income is predicted to be $100,000 may easily have an actual income of $80,000 or $120,000 (a [[standard deviation]] of around $20,000), while another person with a predicted income of $10,000 is unlikely to have the same $20,000 standard deviation, which would imply their actual income would vary anywhere between -$10,000 and $30,000. (In fact, as this shows, in many cases\u2014often the same cases where the assumption of normally distributed errors fails\u2014the variance or standard deviation should be predicted to be proportional to the mean, rather than constant.) Simple linear regression estimation methods give less precise parameter estimates and misleading inferential quantities such as standard errors when substantial heteroscedasticity is present. However, various estimation techniques (e.g. [[weighted least squares]] and [[heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors]]) can handle heteroscedasticity in a quite general way. [[Bayesian linear regression]] techniques can also be used when the variance is assumed to be a function of the mean. It is also possible in some cases to fix the problem by applying a transformation to the response variable (e.g. fit the [[logarithm]] of the response variable using a linear regression model, which implies that the response variable has a [[log-normal distribution]] rather than a [[normal distribution]]).\n*'''Independence''' of errors.  This assumes that the errors of the response variables are uncorrelated with each other. (Actual [[Independence (probability theory)|statistical independence]] is a stronger condition than mere lack of correlation and is often not needed, although it can be exploited if it is known to hold.) Some methods (e.g. [[generalized least squares]]) are capable of handling correlated errors, although they typically require significantly more data unless some sort of [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] is used to bias the model towards assuming uncorrelated errors. [[Bayesian linear regression]] is a general way of handling this issue.\n*'''Lack of perfect multicollinearity''' in the predictors.  For standard [[least squares]] estimation methods, the design matrix ''X'' must have full [[column rank]] ''p''; otherwise, we have a condition known as perfect [[multicollinearity]] in the predictor variables.  This can be triggered by having two or more perfectly correlated predictor variables (e.g. if the same predictor variable is mistakenly given twice, either without transforming one of the copies or by transforming one of the copies linearly). It can also happen if there is too little data available compared to the number of parameters to be estimated (e.g. fewer data points than regression coefficients). In the case of perfect multicollinearity, the parameter vector '''''\u03b2''''' will be [[non-identifiable]]\u2014it has no unique solution.  At most we will be able to identify some of the parameters, i.e. narrow down its value to some linear subspace of '''R'''<sup>''p''</sup>. See [[partial least squares regression]].  Methods for fitting linear models with multicollinearity have been developed;<ref name=\"tibs_lasso\" /><ref name=\"efron_lars\" /><ref name=\"hawkins_pcr\" /><ref name=\"joliffe_pcr\" /> some require additional assumptions such as \"effect sparsity\"\u2014that a large fraction of the effects are exactly zero.<br /> Note that the more computationally expensive iterated algorithms for parameter estimation, such as those used in [[generalized linear model]]s, do not suffer from this problem.\n\nBeyond these assumptions, several other statistical properties of the data strongly influence the performance of different estimation methods:\n* The statistical relationship between the error terms and the regressors plays an important role in determining whether an estimation procedure has desirable sampling properties such as being unbiased and consistent.\n* The arrangement, or [[probability distribution]] of the predictor variables '''x''' has a major influence on the precision of estimates of '''''\u03b2'''''. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] and [[design of experiments]] are highly developed subfields of statistics that provide guidance for collecting data in such a way to achieve a precise estimate of '''''\u03b2'''''.\n\n===Interpretation===\n[[File:Anscombe's quartet 3.svg|thumb|upright=2|The data sets in the [[Anscombe's quartet]] are designed to have approximately the same linear regression line (as well as nearly identical means, standard deviations, and correlations) but are graphically very different. This illustrates the pitfalls of relying solely on a fitted model to understand the relationship between variables.]]\nA fitted linear regression model can be used to identify the relationship between a single predictor variable ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> and the response variable ''y'' when all the other predictor variables in the model are \"held fixed\". Specifically, the interpretation of ''\u03b2''<sub>''j''</sub> is the [[expected value|expected]] change in ''y'' for a one-unit change in ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> when the other covariates are held fixed\u2014that is, the expected value of the [[partial derivative]] of ''y'' with respect to ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>. This is sometimes called the ''unique effect'' of ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> on ''y''. In contrast, the ''marginal effect'' of ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> on ''y'' can be assessed using a [[Pearson correlation|correlation coefficient]] or [[simple linear regression]] model relating only ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> to ''y''; this effect is the [[total derivative]] of ''y'' with respect to ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>.\n\nCare must be taken when interpreting regression results, as some of the regressors may not allow for marginal changes (such as [[Dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variables]], or the intercept term), while others cannot be held fixed (recall the example from the introduction: it would be impossible to \"hold ''t<sub>i</sub>'' fixed\" and at the same time change the value of ''t<sub>i</sub>''<sup>2</sup>).\n\nIt is possible that the unique effect can be nearly zero even when the marginal effect is large. This may imply that some other covariate captures all the information in ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>, so that once that variable is in the model, there is no contribution of ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> to the variation in ''y''. Conversely, the unique effect of ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> can be large while its marginal effect is nearly zero. This would happen if the other covariates explained a great deal of the variation of ''y'', but they mainly explain variation in a way that is complementary to what is captured by ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>. In this case, including the other variables in the model reduces the part of the variability of ''y'' that is unrelated to ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>, thereby strengthening the apparent relationship with ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>.\n\nThe meaning of the expression \"held fixed\" may depend on how the values of the predictor variables arise. If the experimenter directly sets the values of the predictor variables according to a study design, the comparisons of interest may literally correspond to comparisons among units whose predictor variables have been \"held fixed\" by the experimenter. Alternatively, the expression \"held fixed\" can refer to a selection that takes place in the context of data analysis. In this case, we \"hold a variable fixed\" by restricting our attention to the subsets of the data that happen to have a common value for the given predictor variable. This is the only interpretation of \"held fixed\" that can be used in an observational study.\n\nThe notion of a \"unique effect\" is appealing when studying a complex system where multiple interrelated components influence the response variable. In some cases, it can literally be interpreted as the causal effect of an intervention that is linked to the value of a predictor variable. However, it has been argued that in many cases multiple regression analysis fails to clarify the relationships between the predictor variables and the response variable when the predictors are correlated with each other and are not assigned following a study design.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Regression Analysis: A Constructive Critique | journal=Criminal Justice Review | volume=32 | issue=3 | pages=301\u2013302 | author=Berk, Richard A. | doi=10.1177/0734016807304871| year=2007 }}</ref> [[Commonality analysis]] may be helpful in disentangling the shared and unique impacts of correlated independent variables.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|title=Beyond multiple regression: Using commonality analysis to better understand R2 results|journal=Gifted Child Quarterly|date=2011|volume=55|issue=4|pages=313\u2013318|doi=10.1177/0016986211422217}}</ref>\n\n==Extensions==\nNumerous extensions of linear regression have been developed, which allow some or all of the assumptions underlying the basic model to be relaxed.\n\n===Simple and multiple linear regression===\n[[Image:Linear regression.svg|thumb|right|400px|Example of [[simple linear regression]], which has one independent variable]]\nThe very simplest case of a single [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] predictor variable ''x'' and a single scalar response variable ''y'' is known as ''[[simple linear regression]]''.  The extension to multiple and/or [[Euclidean vector|vector]]-valued predictor variables (denoted with a capital ''X'') is known as ''multiple linear regression'', also known as ''multivariable linear regression''.  Nearly all real-world regression models involve multiple predictors, and basic descriptions of linear regression are often phrased in terms of the multiple regression model.  Note, however, that in these cases the response variable ''y'' is still a scalar. Another term, ''multivariate linear regression'', refers to cases where ''y'' is a vector, i.e., the same as ''general linear regression''.\n\n===General linear models===\nThe [[general linear model]] considers the situation when the response variable is not a scalar (for each observation) but a vector, '''y'''<sub>''i''</sub>. Conditional linearity of <math>E(\\mathbf{y}\\mid\\mathbf{x}_i)=\\mathbf{x}_i^\\mathsf{T}B</math> is still assumed, with a matrix ''B'' replacing the vector '''''\u03b2''''' of the classical linear regression model. Multivariate analogues of [[ordinary least squares]] (OLS) and [[generalized least squares]] (GLS) have been developed. \"General linear models\" are also called \"multivariate linear models\". These are not the same as multivariable linear models (also called \"multiple linear models\").\n\n===Heteroscedastic models===\nVarious models have been created that allow for [[heteroscedasticity]], i.e. the errors for different response variables may have different [[variance]]s.  For example, [[weighted least squares]] is a method for estimating linear regression models when the response variables may have different error variances, possibly with correlated errors. (See also [[Linear least squares (mathematics)#Weighted linear least squares|Weighted linear least squares]], and [[Generalized least squares]].) [[Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors]] is an improved method for use with uncorrelated but potentially heteroscedastic errors.\n\n===Generalized linear models===\n[[Generalized linear model]]s (GLMs) are a framework for modeling response variables that are bounded or discrete. This is used, for example:\n*when modeling positive quantities (e.g. prices or populations) that vary over a large scale\u2014which are better described using a [[skewed distribution]] such as the [[log-normal distribution]] or [[Poisson distribution]] (although GLMs are not used for log-normal data, instead the response variable is simply transformed using the logarithm function);\n*when modeling [[categorical data]], such as the choice of a given candidate in an election (which is better described using a [[Bernoulli distribution]]/[[binomial distribution]] for binary choices, or a [[categorical distribution]]/[[multinomial distribution]] for multi-way choices), where there are a fixed number of choices that cannot be meaningfully ordered;\n*when modeling [[ordinal data]], e.g. ratings on a scale from 0 to 5, where the different outcomes can be ordered but where the quantity itself may not have any absolute meaning (e.g. a rating of 4 may not be \"twice as good\" in any objective sense as a rating of 2, but simply indicates that it is better than 2 or 3 but not as good as 5).\nGeneralized linear models allow for an arbitrary ''link function'', ''g'', that relates the [[mean]] of the response variable(s) to the predictors: <math>E(Y) = g^{-1}(XB)</math>. The link function is often related to the distribution of the response, and in particular it typically has the effect of transforming between the <math>(-\\infty,\\infty)</math> range of the linear predictor and the range of the response variable.\n\nSome common examples of GLMs are:\n*[[Poisson regression]] for count data.\n*[[Logistic regression]] and [[probit regression]] for binary data.\n*[[Multinomial logistic regression]] and [[multinomial probit]] regression for categorical data.\n*[[Ordered logit]] and [[ordered probit]] regression for ordinal data.\n\nSingle index models{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} allow some degree of nonlinearity in the relationship between ''x'' and ''y'', while preserving the central role of the linear predictor ''\u03b2''\u2032''x'' as in the classical linear regression model. Under certain conditions, simply applying OLS to data from a single-index model will consistently estimate ''\u03b2'' up to a proportionality constant.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The Identification of a Particular Nonlinear Time Series System | last=Brillinger | first=David R. | journal=Biometrika | volume=64 | year=1977 | pages=509\u2013515 | doi=10.1093/biomet/64.3.509 | issue=3 | jstor=2345326}}</ref>\n\n===Hierarchical linear models===\n[[Hierarchical linear models]] (or ''multilevel regression'') organizes the data into a hierarchy of regressions, for example where ''A'' is regressed on ''B'', and ''B'' is regressed on ''C''. It is often used where the variables of interest have a natural hierarchical structure such as in educational statistics, where students are nested in classrooms, classrooms are nested in schools, and schools are nested in some administrative grouping, such as a school district. The response variable might be a measure of student achievement such as a test score, and different covariates would be collected at the classroom, school, and school district levels.\n\n===Errors-in-variables===\n[[Errors-in-variables model]]s (or \"measurement error models\") extend the traditional linear regression model to allow the predictor variables ''X'' to be observed with error. This error causes standard estimators of ''\u03b2'' to become biased. Generally, the form of bias is an attenuation, meaning that the effects are biased toward zero.\n\n===Others===\n* In [[Dempster\u2013Shafer theory]], or a [[linear belief function]] in particular, a linear regression model may be represented as a partially swept matrix, which can be combined with similar matrices representing observations and other assumed normal distributions and state equations. The combination of swept or unswept matrices provides an alternative method for estimating linear regression models.\n\n==Estimation methods==\nA large number of procedures have been developed for [[parameter]] estimation and inference in linear regression. These methods differ in computational simplicity of algorithms, presence of a closed-form solution, robustness with respect to heavy-tailed distributions, and theoretical assumptions needed to validate desirable statistical properties such as [[consistent estimator|consistency]] and asymptotic [[efficiency (statistics)|efficiency]].\n\nSome of the more common estimation techniques for linear regression are summarized below.\n\n===Least-squares estimation and related techniques===\n{{main|Linear least squares}}\n[[File:Galton's correlation diagram 1875.jpg|thumb|upright=2|[[Francis Galton|Francis Galton's]] 1875 illustration of the correlation between the heights of adults and their parents.

The \"locus of horizontal tangential points\" passing through the leftmost and rightmost points on the ellipse (which is a [[level curve]] of the [[bivariate normal distribution]] estimated from the data) is the [[Ordinary least squares|OLS]] estimate of the regression of parents' heights on children's heights, while the \"locus of vertical tangential points\" is the OLS estimate of the regression of children's heights on parent's heights.

(See also [[Bayesian multivariate linear regression]].) In particular, the regression coefficients \u03b2 are assumed to be [[random variable]]s with a specified [[prior distribution]].  The prior distribution can bias the solutions for the regression coefficients, in a way similar to (but more general than) [[ridge regression]] or [[lasso regression]].  In addition, the Bayesian estimation process produces not a single point estimate for the \"best\" values of the regression coefficients but an entire [[posterior distribution]], completely describing the uncertainty surrounding the quantity.  This can be used to estimate the \"best\" coefficients using the mean, mode, median, any quantile (see [[quantile regression]]), or any other function of the posterior distribution.\n* '''[[Quantile regression]]''' focuses on the conditional quantiles of ''y'' given ''X'' rather than the conditional mean of ''y'' given ''X''. Linear quantile regression models a particular conditional quantile, for example the conditional median, as a linear function \u03b2<sup>T</sup>''x'' of the predictors.\n* '''[[Mixed model]]s''' are widely used to analyze linear regression relationships involving dependent data when the dependencies have a known structure. Common applications of mixed models include analysis of data involving repeated measurements, such as longitudinal data, or data obtained from cluster sampling. They are generally fit as [[parametric statistics|parametric]] models, using maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation. In the case where the errors are modeled as [[normal distribution|normal]] random variables, there is a close connection between mixed models and generalized least squares.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Multilevel Mixed Linear Model Analysis Using Iterative Generalized Least Squares | last=Goldstein | first=H. | journal=Biometrika | volume=73 | year=1986 | pages=43\u201356 | doi=10.1093/biomet/73.1.43 | issue=1 | jstor=2336270}}</ref> [[Fixed effects estimation]] is an alternative approach to analyzing this type of data.\n* '''[[Principal component regression]]''' (PCR)<ref name=\"hawkins_pcr\">{{cite journal | title=On the Investigation of Alternative Regressions by Principal Component Analysis | last=Hawkins | first=Douglas M. | journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C | volume=22 | year=1973 | pages=275\u2013286 | issue=3 | jstor=2346776}}</ref><ref name=\"joliffe_pcr\">{{cite journal | title=A Note on the Use of Principal Components in Regression | last=Jolliffe | first= Ian T. | journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C | volume=31 | year=1982 | pages=300\u2013303 | issue=3 | jstor=2348005}}</ref> is used when the number of predictor variables is large, or when strong correlations exist among the predictor variables.

It ranks as one of the most important tools used in these disciplines.\n\n===Trend line===\n{{Main|Trend estimation}}\nA '''trend line''' represents a trend, the long-term movement in [[time series]] data after other components have been accounted for. It tells whether a particular data set (say GDP, oil prices or stock prices) have increased or decreased over the period of time. A trend line could simply be drawn by eye through a set of data points, but more properly their position and slope is calculated using statistical techniques like linear regression. Trend lines typically are straight lines, although some variations use higher degree polynomials depending on the degree of curvature desired in the line.\n\nTrend lines are sometimes used in business analytics to show changes in data over time. This has the advantage of being simple. Trend lines are often used to argue that a particular action or event (such as training, or an advertising campaign) caused observed changes at a point in time. This is a simple technique, and does not require a control group, experimental design, or a sophisticated analysis technique. However, it suffers from a lack of scientific validity in cases where other potential changes can affect the data.\n\n===Epidemiology===\nEarly evidence relating [[tobacco smoking]] to mortality and [[morbidity]] came from [[observational studies]] employing regression analysis. In order to reduce [[spurious correlation]]s when analyzing observational data, researchers usually include several variables in their regression models in addition to the variable of primary interest. For example, in a regression model in which cigarette smoking is the independent variable of primary interest and the dependent variable is lifespan measured in years, researchers might include education and income as additional independent variables, to ensure that any observed effect of smoking on lifespan is not due to those other [[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic factors]]. However, it is never possible to include all possible [[confounding]] variables in an empirical analysis. For example, a hypothetical gene might increase mortality and also cause people to smoke more. For this reason, [[randomized controlled trial]]s are often able to generate more compelling evidence of causal relationships than can be obtained using regression analyses of observational data. When controlled experiments are not feasible, variants of regression analysis such as [[instrumental variables]] regression may be used to attempt to estimate causal relationships from observational data.\n\n===Finance===\nThe [[capital asset pricing model]] uses linear regression as well as the concept of [[Beta (finance)|beta]] for analyzing and quantifying the systematic risk of an investment. This comes directly from the beta coefficient of the linear regression model that relates the return on the investment to the return on all risky assets.\n\n===Economics===\n{{Main|Econometrics}}\nLinear regression is the predominant empirical tool in [[economics]].

Most applications fall into one of the following two broad categories:\n* If the goal is prediction, forecasting, or error reduction,{{clarify|date=May 2018|reason=\"error reduction\" in what sense?}} linear regression can be used to fit a predictive model to an observed [[data set]] of values of the response and explanatory variables. After developing such a model, if additional values of the explanatory variables are collected without an accompanying response value, the fitted model can be used to make a prediction of the response.\n* If the goal is to explain variation in the response variable that can be attributed to variation in the explanatory variables, linear regression analysis can be applied to quantify the strength of the relationship between the response and the explanatory variables, and in particular to determine whether some explanatory variables may have no linear relationship with the response at all, or to identify which subsets of explanatory variables may contain redundant information about the response.\n\nLinear regression models are often fitted using the [[least squares]] approach, but they may also be fitted in other ways, such as by minimizing the \"lack of fit\" in some other [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] (as with [[least absolute deviations]] regression), or by minimizing a penalized version of the least squares [[Loss function|cost function]] as in [[ridge regression]] (''L''<sup>2</sup>-norm penalty) and [[Lasso (statistics)|lasso]] (''L''<sup>1</sup>-norm penalty). Conversely, the least squares approach can be used to fit models that are not linear models. Thus, although the terms \"least squares\" and \"linear model\" are closely linked, they are not synonymous.\n\n== Introduction ==\n[[File:Linear least squares example2.png|thumb|In linear regression, the observations (<span style=\"color:red\">'''red'''</span>) are assumed to be the result of random deviations (<span style=\"color:green\">'''green'''</span>) from an underlying relationship (<span style=\"color:blue;\">'''blue'''</span>) between a dependent variable (''y'') and an independent variable (''x'').]]\n\nGiven a [[data]] set <math>\\{y_i,\\, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ip}\\}_{i=1}^n</math> of ''n'' [[statistical unit]]s, a linear regression model assumes that the relationship between the dependent variable ''y'' and the [[Multivector|''p''-vector]] of regressors '''x''' is [[linear function|linear]]. This relationship is modeled through a ''disturbance term'' or ''error variable'' ''\u03b5'' \u2014 an unobserved [[random variable]] that adds \"noise\" to the linear relationship between the dependent variable and regressors. Thus the model takes the form\n: <math>\n y_i = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} x_{i1} + \\cdots + \\beta_{p} x_{ip} + \\varepsilon_i\n = \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_i\\boldsymbol\\beta + \\varepsilon_i,\n \\qquad i = 1, \\ldots, n,\n </math>\nwhere <sup>T</sup> denotes the [[transpose]], so that '''x'''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>T</sup>'''''\u03b2''''' is the [[inner product]] between [[coordinate vector|vectors]] '''x'''<sub>''i''</sub> and '''''\u03b2'''''.\n\nOften these ''n'' equations are stacked together and written in [[matrix notation]] as\n: <math>\n \\mathbf{y} = X\\boldsymbol\\beta + \\boldsymbol\\varepsilon, \\,\n </math>\nwhere\n: <math>\n \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n</math>\n\n: <math>\n X = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{x}^\\mathsf{T}_n \\end{pmatrix}\n = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &  x_{11} & \\cdots & x_{1p} \\\\\n 1 & x_{21} & \\cdots & x_{2p} \\\\\n \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n 1 & x_{n1} & \\cdots & x_{np}\n \\end{pmatrix}, \n</math>\n\n: <math>\n \\boldsymbol\\beta = \\begin{pmatrix} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\beta_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_p \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n \\boldsymbol\\varepsilon = \\begin{pmatrix} \\varepsilon_1 \\\\ \\varepsilon_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\varepsilon_n \\end{pmatrix}.\n </math>\nSome remarks on notation and terminology:\n* <math>\\mathbf{y}</math> is a vector of observed values <math>y_i\\ (i=1,\\ldots,n)</math> of the variable called the ''regressand'', ''endogenous variable'', ''response variable'', ''measured variable'', ''criterion variable'', or ''[[dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]]''. This variable is also sometimes known as the ''predicted variable'', but this should not be confused with ''predicted values'', which are denoted <math>\\hat{y}</math>. The decision as to which variable in a data set is modeled as the dependent variable and which are modeled as the independent variables may be based on a presumption that the value of one of the variables is caused by, or directly influenced by the other variables. Alternatively, there may be an operational reason to model one of the variables in terms of the others, in which case there need be no presumption of causality.\n* <math>X</math> may be seen as a matrix of row-vectors <math>\\mathbf{x}_i</math> or of ''n''-dimensional column-vectors <math>X_j</math>, which are known as ''regressors'', ''exogenous variables'', ''explanatory variables'', ''covariates'', ''input variables'', ''predictor variables'', or ''[[dependent and independent variables|independent variables]]'' (not to be confused with the concept of [[independent random variables]]). The matrix <math>X</math> is sometimes called the [[design matrix]].\n** {{anchor|Intercept}}Usually a constant is included as one of the regressors. In particular, <math>\\mathbf{x}_{i0}=1</math> for <math>i=1,\\ldots,n</math>. The corresponding element of '''''\u03b2''''' is called the ''[[Y-intercept|intercept]]''. Many statistical inference procedures for linear models require an intercept to be present, so it is often included even if theoretical considerations suggest that its value should be zero.\n** Sometimes one of the regressors can be a non-linear function of another regressor or of the data, as in [[polynomial regression]] and [[segmented regression]]. The model remains linear as long as it is linear in the parameter vector '''''\u03b2'''''.\n** The values ''x''<sub>''ij''</sub> may be viewed as either observed values of [[random variable]]s ''X''<sub>''j''</sub> or as fixed values chosen prior to observing the dependent variable. Both interpretations may be appropriate in different cases, and they generally lead to the same estimation procedures; however different approaches to asymptotic analysis are used in these two situations.\n* <math>\\boldsymbol\\beta</math> is a <math>(p+1)</math>-dimensional ''parameter vector'', where <math>\\beta_0</math> is the intercept term (if one is included in the model\u2014otherwise <math>\\boldsymbol\\beta</math> is ''p''-dimensional). Its elements are known as ''effects'' or ''regression coefficients'' (although the latter term is sometimes reserved for the ''estimated'' effects). Statistical [[estimation theory|estimation]] and [[statistical inference|inference]] in linear regression focuses on '''''\u03b2'''''. The elements of this parameter vector are interpreted as the [[partial derivative]]s of the dependent variable with respect to the various independent variables.\n* <math>\\boldsymbol\\varepsilon</math> is a vector of values <math>\\varepsilon_i</math>. This part of the model is called the ''error term'', ''disturbance term'', or sometimes ''noise'' (in contrast with the \"signal\" provided by the rest of the model). This variable captures all other factors which influence the dependent variable ''y'' other than the regressors '''x'''. The relationship between the error term and the regressors, for example their [[correlation]], is a crucial consideration in formulating a linear regression model, as it will determine the appropriate estimation method.\n\n'''Example'''.<!-- this example is referred to again below, so check the rest of article if you make substantive changes here --> Consider a situation where a small ball is being tossed up in the air and then we measure its heights of ascent ''h<sub>i</sub>'' at various moments in time ''t<sub>i</sub>''. Physics tells us that, ignoring the drag, the relationship can be modeled as\n: <math>\n h_i = \\beta_1 t_i + \\beta_2 t_i^2 + \\varepsilon_i,\n </math>\nwhere ''\u03b2''<sub>1</sub> determines the initial velocity of the ball, ''\u03b2''<sub>2</sub> is proportional to the [[standard gravity]], and ''\u03b5''<sub>''i''</sub> is due to measurement errors. Linear regression can be used to estimate the values of ''\u03b2''<sub>1</sub> and ''\u03b2''<sub>2</sub> from the measured data.

Numerous extensions have been developed that allow each of these assumptions to be relaxed (i.e. reduced to a weaker form), and in some cases eliminated entirely. Generally these extensions make the estimation procedure more complex and time-consuming, and may also require more data in order to produce an equally precise model.\n\n[[Image:Polyreg scheffe.svg|thumb|325px|Example of a cubic polynomial regression, which is a type of linear regression.]]\nThe following are the major assumptions made by standard linear regression models with standard estimation techniques (e.g. [[ordinary least squares]]):\n\n*'''Weak exogeneity'''.  This essentially means that the predictor variables ''x'' can be treated as fixed values, rather than [[random variable]]s.  This means, for example, that the predictor variables are assumed to be error-free\u2014that is, not contaminated with measurement errors. Although this assumption is not realistic in many settings, dropping it leads to significantly more difficult [[errors-in-variables model]]s.\n*'''Linearity'''.  This means that the mean of the response variable is a [[linear combination]] of the parameters (regression coefficients) and the predictor variables.  Note that this assumption is much less restrictive than it may at first seem.  Because the predictor variables are treated as fixed values (see above), linearity is really only a restriction on the parameters.  The predictor variables themselves can be arbitrarily transformed, and in fact multiple copies of the same underlying predictor variable can be added, each one transformed differently.  This technique is used, for example, in [[polynomial regression]], which uses linear regression to fit the response variable as an arbitrary [[polynomial]] function (up to a given rank) of a predictor variable. This makes linear regression an extremely powerful inference method.  In fact, models such as polynomial regression are often \"too powerful\", in that they tend to [[overfit]] the data.  As a result, some kind of [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] must typically be used to prevent unreasonable solutions coming out of the estimation process.  Common examples are [[ridge regression]] and [[lasso regression]].  [[Bayesian linear regression]] can also be used, which by its nature is more or less immune to the problem of overfitting. (In fact, [[ridge regression]] and [[lasso regression]] can both be viewed as    special cases of Bayesian linear regression, with particular types of [[prior distribution]]s placed on the regression coefficients.)\n*'''Constant variance''' (a.k.a. '''[[homoscedasticity]]''').  This means that different values of the response variable have the same [[variance]] in their errors, regardless of the values of the predictor variables. In practice this assumption is invalid (i.e. the errors are [[heteroscedasticity|heteroscedastic]]) if the response variable can vary over a wide scale. In order to check for heterogeneous error variance, or when a pattern of residuals violates model assumptions of homoscedasticity (error is equally variable around the 'best-fitting line' for all points of x), it is prudent to look for a \"fanning effect\" between residual error and predicted values. This is to say there will be a systematic change in the absolute or squared residuals when plotted against the predictive variables. Errors will not be evenly distributed across the regression line. Heteroscedasticity will result in the averaging over of distinguishable variances around the points to get a single variance that is inaccurately representing all the variances of the line. In effect, residuals appear clustered and spread apart on their predicted plots for larger and smaller values for points along the linear regression line, and the mean squared error for the model will be wrong. Typically, for example, a response variable whose mean is large will have a greater variance than one whose mean is small. For example, a given person whose income is predicted to be $100,000 may easily have an actual income of $80,000 or $120,000 (a [[standard deviation]] of around $20,000), while another person with a predicted income of $10,000 is unlikely to have the same $20,000 standard deviation, which would imply their actual income would vary anywhere between -$10,000 and $30,000. (In fact, as this shows, in many cases\u2014often the same cases where the assumption of normally distributed errors fails\u2014the variance or standard deviation should be predicted to be proportional to the mean, rather than constant.) Simple linear regression estimation methods give less precise parameter estimates and misleading inferential quantities such as standard errors when substantial heteroscedasticity is present. However, various estimation techniques (e.g. [[weighted least squares]] and [[heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors]]) can handle heteroscedasticity in a quite general way. [[Bayesian linear regression]] techniques can also be used when the variance is assumed to be a function of the mean. It is also possible in some cases to fix the problem by applying a transformation to the response variable (e.g. fit the [[logarithm]] of the response variable using a linear regression model, which implies that the response variable has a [[log-normal distribution]] rather than a [[normal distribution]]).\n*'''Independence''' of errors.  This assumes that the errors of the response variables are uncorrelated with each other. (Actual [[Independence (probability theory)|statistical independence]] is a stronger condition than mere lack of correlation and is often not needed, although it can be exploited if it is known to hold.) Some methods (e.g. [[generalized least squares]]) are capable of handling correlated errors, although they typically require significantly more data unless some sort of [[regularization (mathematics)|regularization]] is used to bias the model towards assuming uncorrelated errors. [[Bayesian linear regression]] is a general way of handling this issue.\n*'''Lack of perfect multicollinearity''' in the predictors.  For standard [[least squares]] estimation methods, the design matrix ''X'' must have full [[column rank]] ''p''; otherwise, we have a condition known as perfect [[multicollinearity]] in the predictor variables.  This can be triggered by having two or more perfectly correlated predictor variables (e.g. if the same predictor variable is mistakenly given twice, either without transforming one of the copies or by transforming one of the copies linearly). It can also happen if there is too little data available compared to the number of parameters to be estimated (e.g. fewer data points than regression coefficients). In the case of perfect multicollinearity, the parameter vector '''''\u03b2''''' will be [[non-identifiable]]\u2014it has no unique solution.  At most we will be able to identify some of the parameters, i.e. narrow down its value to some linear subspace of '''R'''<sup>''p''</sup>. See [[partial least squares regression]].  Methods for fitting linear models with multicollinearity have been developed;<ref name=\"tibs_lasso\" /><ref name=\"efron_lars\" /><ref name=\"hawkins_pcr\" /><ref name=\"joliffe_pcr\" /> some require additional assumptions such as \"effect sparsity\"\u2014that a large fraction of the effects are exactly zero.<br /> Note that the more computationally expensive iterated algorithms for parameter estimation, such as those used in [[generalized linear model]]s, do not suffer from this problem.\n\nBeyond these assumptions, several other statistical properties of the data strongly influence the performance of different estimation methods:\n* The statistical relationship between the error terms and the regressors plays an important role in determining whether an estimation procedure has desirable sampling properties such as being unbiased and consistent.\n* The arrangement, or [[probability distribution]] of the predictor variables '''x''' has a major influence on the precision of estimates of '''''\u03b2'''''. [[Sampling (statistics)|Sampling]] and [[design of experiments]] are highly developed subfields of statistics that provide guidance for collecting data in such a way to achieve a precise estimate of '''''\u03b2'''''.\n\n===Interpretation===\n[[File:Anscombe's quartet 3.svg|thumb|upright=2|The data sets in the [[Anscombe's quartet]] are designed to have approximately the same linear regression line (as well as nearly identical means, standard deviations, and correlations) but are graphically very different. This illustrates the pitfalls of relying solely on a fitted model to understand the relationship between variables.]]\nA fitted linear regression model can be used to identify the relationship between a single predictor variable ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> and the response variable ''y'' when all the other predictor variables in the model are \"held fixed\". Specifically, the interpretation of ''\u03b2''<sub>''j''</sub> is the [[expected value|expected]] change in ''y'' for a one-unit change in ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> when the other covariates are held fixed\u2014that is, the expected value of the [[partial derivative]] of ''y'' with respect to ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>. This is sometimes called the ''unique effect'' of ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> on ''y''. In contrast, the ''marginal effect'' of ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> on ''y'' can be assessed using a [[Pearson correlation|correlation coefficient]] or [[simple linear regression]] model relating only ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> to ''y''; this effect is the [[total derivative]] of ''y'' with respect to ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>.\n\nCare must be taken when interpreting regression results, as some of the regressors may not allow for marginal changes (such as [[Dummy variable (statistics)|dummy variables]], or the intercept term), while others cannot be held fixed (recall the example from the introduction: it would be impossible to \"hold ''t<sub>i</sub>'' fixed\" and at the same time change the value of ''t<sub>i</sub>''<sup>2</sup>).\n\nIt is possible that the unique effect can be nearly zero even when the marginal effect is large. This may imply that some other covariate captures all the information in ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>, so that once that variable is in the model, there is no contribution of ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> to the variation in ''y''. Conversely, the unique effect of ''x''<sub>''j''</sub> can be large while its marginal effect is nearly zero. This would happen if the other covariates explained a great deal of the variation of ''y'', but they mainly explain variation in a way that is complementary to what is captured by ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>. In this case, including the other variables in the model reduces the part of the variability of ''y'' that is unrelated to ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>, thereby strengthening the apparent relationship with ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>.\n\nThe meaning of the expression \"held fixed\" may depend on how the values of the predictor variables arise. If the experimenter directly sets the values of the predictor variables according to a study design, the comparisons of interest may literally correspond to comparisons among units whose predictor variables have been \"held fixed\" by the experimenter. Alternatively, the expression \"held fixed\" can refer to a selection that takes place in the context of data analysis. In this case, we \"hold a variable fixed\" by restricting our attention to the subsets of the data that happen to have a common value for the given predictor variable. This is the only interpretation of \"held fixed\" that can be used in an observational study.\n\nThe notion of a \"unique effect\" is appealing when studying a complex system where multiple interrelated components influence the response variable. In some cases, it can literally be interpreted as the causal effect of an intervention that is linked to the value of a predictor variable. However, it has been argued that in many cases multiple regression analysis fails to clarify the relationships between the predictor variables and the response variable when the predictors are correlated with each other and are not assigned following a study design.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Regression Analysis: A Constructive Critique | journal=Criminal Justice Review | volume=32 | issue=3 | pages=301\u2013302 | author=Berk, Richard A. | doi=10.1177/0734016807304871| year=2007 }}</ref> [[Commonality analysis]] may be helpful in disentangling the shared and unique impacts of correlated independent variables.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|title=Beyond multiple regression: Using commonality analysis to better understand R2 results|journal=Gifted Child Quarterly|date=2011|volume=55|issue=4|pages=313\u2013318|doi=10.1177/0016986211422217}}</ref>\n\n==Extensions==\nNumerous extensions of linear regression have been developed, which allow some or all of the assumptions underlying the basic model to be relaxed.\n\n===Simple and multiple linear regression===\n[[Image:Linear regression.svg|thumb|right|400px|Example of [[simple linear regression]], which has one independent variable]]\nThe very simplest case of a single [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] predictor variable ''x'' and a single scalar response variable ''y'' is known as ''[[simple linear regression]]''.  The extension to multiple and/or [[Euclidean vector|vector]]-valued predictor variables (denoted with a capital ''X'') is known as ''multiple linear regression'', also known as ''multivariable linear regression''.  Nearly all real-world regression models involve multiple predictors, and basic descriptions of linear regression are often phrased in terms of the multiple regression model.  Note, however, that in these cases the response variable ''y'' is still a scalar. Another term, ''multivariate linear regression'', refers to cases where ''y'' is a vector, i.e., the same as ''general linear regression''.\n\n===General linear models===\nThe [[general linear model]] considers the situation when the response variable is not a scalar (for each observation) but a vector, '''y'''<sub>''i''</sub>. Conditional linearity of <math>E(\\mathbf{y}\\mid\\mathbf{x}_i)=\\mathbf{x}_i^\\mathsf{T}B</math> is still assumed, with a matrix ''B'' replacing the vector '''''\u03b2''''' of the classical linear regression model. Multivariate analogues of [[ordinary least squares]] (OLS) and [[generalized least squares]] (GLS) have been developed. \"General linear models\" are also called \"multivariate linear models\". These are not the same as multivariable linear models (also called \"multiple linear models\").\n\n===Heteroscedastic models===\nVarious models have been created that allow for [[heteroscedasticity]], i.e. the errors for different response variables may have different [[variance]]s.  For example, [[weighted least squares]] is a method for estimating linear regression models when the response variables may have different error variances, possibly with correlated errors. (See also [[Linear least squares (mathematics)#Weighted linear least squares|Weighted linear least squares]], and [[Generalized least squares]].) [[Heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors]] is an improved method for use with uncorrelated but potentially heteroscedastic errors.\n\n===Generalized linear models===\n[[Generalized linear model]]s (GLMs) are a framework for modeling response variables that are bounded or discrete. This is used, for example:\n*when modeling positive quantities (e.g. prices or populations) that vary over a large scale\u2014which are better described using a [[skewed distribution]] such as the [[log-normal distribution]] or [[Poisson distribution]] (although GLMs are not used for log-normal data, instead the response variable is simply transformed using the logarithm function);\n*when modeling [[categorical data]], such as the choice of a given candidate in an election (which is better described using a [[Bernoulli distribution]]/[[binomial distribution]] for binary choices, or a [[categorical distribution]]/[[multinomial distribution]] for multi-way choices), where there are a fixed number of choices that cannot be meaningfully ordered;\n*when modeling [[ordinal data]], e.g. ratings on a scale from 0 to 5, where the different outcomes can be ordered but where the quantity itself may not have any absolute meaning (e.g. a rating of 4 may not be \"twice as good\" in any objective sense as a rating of 2, but simply indicates that it is better than 2 or 3 but not as good as 5).\nGeneralized linear models allow for an arbitrary ''link function'', ''g'', that relates the [[mean]] of the response variable(s) to the predictors: <math>E(Y) = g^{-1}(XB)</math>. The link function is often related to the distribution of the response, and in particular it typically has the effect of transforming between the <math>(-\\infty,\\infty)</math> range of the linear predictor and the range of the response variable.\n\nSome common examples of GLMs are:\n*[[Poisson regression]] for count data.\n*[[Logistic regression]] and [[probit regression]] for binary data.\n*[[Multinomial logistic regression]] and [[multinomial probit]] regression for categorical data.\n*[[Ordered logit]] and [[ordered probit]] regression for ordinal data.\n\nSingle index models{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} allow some degree of nonlinearity in the relationship between ''x'' and ''y'', while preserving the central role of the linear predictor ''\u03b2''\u2032''x'' as in the classical linear regression model. Under certain conditions, simply applying OLS to data from a single-index model will consistently estimate ''\u03b2'' up to a proportionality constant.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The Identification of a Particular Nonlinear Time Series System | last=Brillinger | first=David R. | journal=Biometrika | volume=64 | year=1977 | pages=509\u2013515 | doi=10.1093/biomet/64.3.509 | issue=3 | jstor=2345326}}</ref>\n\n===Hierarchical linear models===\n[[Hierarchical linear models]] (or ''multilevel regression'') organizes the data into a hierarchy of regressions, for example where ''A'' is regressed on ''B'', and ''B'' is regressed on ''C''. It is often used where the variables of interest have a natural hierarchical structure such as in educational statistics, where students are nested in classrooms, classrooms are nested in schools, and schools are nested in some administrative grouping, such as a school district. The response variable might be a measure of student achievement such as a test score, and different covariates would be collected at the classroom, school, and school district levels.\n\n===Errors-in-variables===\n[[Errors-in-variables model]]s (or \"measurement error models\") extend the traditional linear regression model to allow the predictor variables ''X'' to be observed with error. This error causes standard estimators of ''\u03b2'' to become biased. Generally, the form of bias is an attenuation, meaning that the effects are biased toward zero.\n\n===Others===\n* In [[Dempster\u2013Shafer theory]], or a [[linear belief function]] in particular, a linear regression model may be represented as a partially swept matrix, which can be combined with similar matrices representing observations and other assumed normal distributions and state equations. The combination of swept or unswept matrices provides an alternative method for estimating linear regression models.\n\n==Estimation methods==\nA large number of procedures have been developed for [[parameter]] estimation and inference in linear regression. These methods differ in computational simplicity of algorithms, presence of a closed-form solution, robustness with respect to heavy-tailed distributions, and theoretical assumptions needed to validate desirable statistical properties such as [[consistent estimator|consistency]] and asymptotic [[efficiency (statistics)|efficiency]].\n\nSome of the more common estimation techniques for linear regression are summarized below.\n\n===Least-squares estimation and related techniques===\n{{main|Linear least squares}}\n[[File:Galton's correlation diagram 1875.jpg|thumb|upright=2|[[Francis Galton|Francis Galton's]] 1875 illustration of the correlation between the heights of adults and their parents.

(See also [[Bayesian multivariate linear regression]].) In particular, the regression coefficients \u03b2 are assumed to be [[random variable]]s with a specified [[prior distribution]].  The prior distribution can bias the solutions for the regression coefficients, in a way similar to (but more general than) [[ridge regression]] or [[lasso regression]].  In addition, the Bayesian estimation process produces not a single point estimate for the \"best\" values of the regression coefficients but an entire [[posterior distribution]], completely describing the uncertainty surrounding the quantity.  This can be used to estimate the \"best\" coefficients using the mean, mode, median, any quantile (see [[quantile regression]]), or any other function of the posterior distribution.\n* '''[[Quantile regression]]''' focuses on the conditional quantiles of ''y'' given ''X'' rather than the conditional mean of ''y'' given ''X''. Linear quantile regression models a particular conditional quantile, for example the conditional median, as a linear function \u03b2<sup>T</sup>''x'' of the predictors.\n* '''[[Mixed model]]s''' are widely used to analyze linear regression relationships involving dependent data when the dependencies have a known structure. Common applications of mixed models include analysis of data involving repeated measurements, such as longitudinal data, or data obtained from cluster sampling. They are generally fit as [[parametric statistics|parametric]] models, using maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimation. In the case where the errors are modeled as [[normal distribution|normal]] random variables, there is a close connection between mixed models and generalized least squares.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Multilevel Mixed Linear Model Analysis Using Iterative Generalized Least Squares | last=Goldstein | first=H. | journal=Biometrika | volume=73 | year=1986 | pages=43\u201356 | doi=10.1093/biomet/73.1.43 | issue=1 | jstor=2336270}}</ref> [[Fixed effects estimation]] is an alternative approach to analyzing this type of data.\n* '''[[Principal component regression]]''' (PCR)<ref name=\"hawkins_pcr\">{{cite journal | title=On the Investigation of Alternative Regressions by Principal Component Analysis | last=Hawkins | first=Douglas M. | journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C | volume=22 | year=1973 | pages=275\u2013286 | issue=3 | jstor=2346776}}</ref><ref name=\"joliffe_pcr\">{{cite journal | title=A Note on the Use of Principal Components in Regression | last=Jolliffe | first= Ian T. | journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C | volume=31 | year=1982 | pages=300\u2013303 | issue=3 | jstor=2348005}}</ref> is used when the number of predictor variables is large, or when strong correlations exist among the predictor variables. This two-stage procedure first reduces the predictor variables using [[principal component analysis]] then uses the reduced variables in an OLS regression fit.

It ranks as one of the most important tools used in these disciplines.\n\n===Trend line===\n{{Main|Trend estimation}}\nA '''trend line''' represents a trend, the long-term movement in [[time series]] data after other components have been accounted for. It tells whether a particular data set (say GDP, oil prices or stock prices) have increased or decreased over the period of time. A trend line could simply be drawn by eye through a set of data points, but more properly their position and slope is calculated using statistical techniques like linear regression. Trend lines typically are straight lines, although some variations use higher degree polynomials depending on the degree of curvature desired in the line.\n\nTrend lines are sometimes used in business analytics to show changes in data over time. This has the advantage of being simple. Trend lines are often used to argue that a particular action or event (such as training, or an advertising campaign) caused observed changes at a point in time. This is a simple technique, and does not require a control group, experimental design, or a sophisticated analysis technique. However, it suffers from a lack of scientific validity in cases where other potential changes can affect the data.\n\n===Epidemiology===\nEarly evidence relating [[tobacco smoking]] to mortality and [[morbidity]] came from [[observational studies]] employing regression analysis. In order to reduce [[spurious correlation]]s when analyzing observational data, researchers usually include several variables in their regression models in addition to the variable of primary interest. For example, in a regression model in which cigarette smoking is the independent variable of primary interest and the dependent variable is lifespan measured in years, researchers might include education and income as additional independent variables, to ensure that any observed effect of smoking on lifespan is not due to those other [[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic factors]]. However, it is never possible to include all possible [[confounding]] variables in an empirical analysis. For example, a hypothetical gene might increase mortality and also cause people to smoke more. For this reason, [[randomized controlled trial]]s are often able to generate more compelling evidence of causal relationships than can be obtained using regression analyses of observational data. When controlled experiments are not feasible, variants of regression analysis such as [[instrumental variables]] regression may be used to attempt to estimate causal relationships from observational data.\n\n===Finance===\nThe [[capital asset pricing model]] uses linear regression as well as the concept of [[Beta (finance)|beta]] for analyzing and quantifying the systematic risk of an investment. This comes directly from the beta coefficient of the linear regression model that relates the return on the investment to the return on all risky assets.\n\n===Economics===\n{{Main|Econometrics}}\nLinear regression is the predominant empirical tool in [[economics]].

After they perform covers of famous songs, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to guess who the celebrities could be after each performs, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. It was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] as \"Monster\" and [[Wayne Brady]] as \"Fox\", respectively. While noted for being more positive than other [[reality television]] shows, the series has received generally unfavorable reviews from critics. However, its costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination. The series has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from being revealed before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider it at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. In an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

After they perform covers of famous songs, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to guess who the celebrities could be after each performs, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. It was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] as \"Monster\" and [[Wayne Brady]] as \"Fox\", respectively. While noted for being more positive than other [[reality television]] shows, the series has received generally unfavorable reviews from critics. However, its costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination. The series has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nExtensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from being revealed before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider it at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. The series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020.

To the north and west was [[Gadap Town]], and to the south lie the towns of [[Gulberg Town, Karachi|Gulberg Town]] and [[North Nazimabad Town]]. The population of New Karachi Town was estimated to be more than 680,000 at the 1998 census. [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajirs]] constitute an overwhelming majority of the population.\n\n==History==\nThe federal government under [[Pervez Musharraf]], who seized power in a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|1999 coup d'etat]], introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \"third tier of government\" ([[Divisions of Pakistan|administrative divisions]]) and replaced it with the fourth tier ([[Districts of Pakistan|districts]]). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former [[Karachi Division]] in 2001, and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including New Karachi Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the [[Karachi Metropolitan Corporation]] system was reintroduced. In 2015, New Karachi Town was re-organized as part of [[District of Central Karachi|Karachi Central]] district.\n\n==Neighbourhoods==\nFatima Jinnah Colony is named after [[Fatima Jinnah]], the sister of the founder of Pakistan, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. The neighbourhood of Hakim Ahsan is named after the mayor of Karachi who met [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] at Karachi airport in 1947.

To the north and west was [[Gadap Town]], and to the south lie the towns of [[Gulberg Town, Karachi|Gulberg Town]] and [[North Nazimabad Town]]. The population of New Karachi Town was estimated to be more than 680,000 at the 1998 census. [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajirs]] constitute an overwhelming majority of the population.\n\n==History==\nThe federal government under [[Pervez Musharraf]], who seized power in a [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|1999 coup d'etat]], introduced local government reforms in the year 2000, which eliminated the previous \"third tier of government\" ([[Divisions of Pakistan|administrative divisions]]) and replaced it with the fourth tier ([[Districts of Pakistan|districts]]). The effect in Karachi was the dissolution of the former [[Karachi Division]] in 2001, and the merging of its five districts to form a new Karachi City-District with eighteen autonomous constituent towns including New Karachi Town. In 2011, the system was disbanded but remained in place for bureaucratic administration until 2015, when the [[Karachi Metropolitan Corporation]] system was reintroduced. In 2015, New Karachi Town was re-organized as part of [[District of Central Karachi|Karachi Central]] district.\n\n==Neighbourhoods==\nFatima Jinnah Colony is named after [[Fatima Jinnah]], the sister of the founder of Pakistan, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]. The neighbourhood of Hakim Ahsan is named after the mayor of Karachi who met [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] at Karachi airport in 1947. Shah Nawaz Bhutto Colony is named after the father of the former [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and grandfather of the later Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]]. [[Shah Nawaz Bhutto]] was the last Prime Minister of the [[princely state]] of [[Junagadh]] and was instrumental in the accession of the state to Pakistan in 1947.
