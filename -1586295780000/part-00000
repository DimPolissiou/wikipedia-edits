It was made and patented by [[Uwe M\u00e8ffert]] after the original 3 layered Rubik's Cube by [[Erno Rubik]], and introduced by [[Tomy|Tomy Toys]] of Japan (then the 3rd largest toy company in the world) in rrr.The largest version of the puzzle is 1.5 feet. <ref>http://www.mefferts.com/puzzles-pyraminx-kokonotsu.htm</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n\n[[File:Pyraminx-3.jpg|frame|right|Pyraminx in the middle of a twist]]\n\nThe Pyraminx was first conceived by M\u00e8ffert in 1970.  He did nothing with his design until 1981 when he first brought it to Hong Kong for production.  Uwe is fond of saying had it not been for Erno Rubik's invention of the cube, his Pyraminx would have never been produced.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe Pyraminx is a puzzle in the shape of a regular tetrahedron, divided into 4 axial pieces, 6 edge pieces, and 4 trivial tips. It can be twisted along its cuts to permute its pieces. The axial pieces are [[octahedron|octahedral]] in shape, although this is not immediately obvious, and can only rotate around the axis they are attached to. The 6 edge pieces can be freely permuted. The trivial tips are so called because they can be twisted independently of all other pieces, making them trivial to place in solved position. Meffert also produces a similar puzzle called the '''Tetraminx''', which is the same as the Pyraminx except that the trivial tips are removed, turning the puzzle into a [[truncated tetrahedron]].\n\n[[File:Pyraminx-4.jpg|frame|right|Scrambled Pyraminx]]\nThe purpose of the Pyraminx is to scramble the colors, and then restore them to their original configuration.\n\nThe 4 trivial tips can be easily rotated to line up with the axial piece they are respectively attached to, and the axial pieces are also easily rotated so that their colors line up with each other. This leaves only the 6 edge pieces as a real challenge to the puzzle. They can be solved by repeatedly applying two 4-twist sequences, which are mirror-image versions of each other. These sequences permute 3 edge pieces at a time and change their orientation differently, so that a combination of both sequences is sufficient to solve the puzzle. However, more efficient solutions (requiring a smaller total number of twists) are generally available (see below).\n\nThe twist of any axial piece is independent of the other three, as is the case with the tips. The six edges can be placed in 6!/2 positions and flipped in 2<sup>5</sup> ways, accounting for parity. Multiplying this by the 3<sup>8</sup> factor for the axial pieces gives 75,582,720 possible positions. However, setting the trivial tips to the right positions reduces the possibilities to 933,120, which is also the number of possible patterns on the Tetraminx. Setting the axial pieces as well reduces the figure to only 11,520, making this a rather simple puzzle to solve.\n\n== Optimal solutions ==\n\nThe maximum number of twists required to solve the Pyraminx is 11. There are 933,120 different positions (disregarding the trivial rotation of the tips), a number that is sufficiently small to allow a computer search for optimal solutions. The table below summarizes the result of such a search, stating the number ''p'' of positions that require ''n'' twists to solve the Pyraminx<ref name=jaap>[https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/pyraminx.htm Pyraminx] - Jaap's Puzzle Page</ref>:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''n''\n|0||1||2 ||3  ||4   ||5   ||6    ||7     ||8     ||9     ||10  ||11\n|-\n!''p''\n|1||8||48||288||1728||9896||51808||220111||480467||166276||2457||32\n|}\n\n== Records ==\n[[File:Pyraminx, Estonian Open 2011.jpg|thumb|Solving a Pyraminx in competition.

They can be split up into two groups.\n\n1) V first- In these methods, two or three edges, and not a side, are solved first, and a set of algorithms, also called LL algs (last layer algs), is given to solve the remaining puzzle.\n\n2) Top first methods- In these methods, three edges around a corner are solved first, and the remaining puzzle is solved using a set of algorithms.\n\nCommon V first methods-\n\na) Layer by Layer - In this method, a face with all edges oriented in the right spot (a.k.a. a layer) is solved, and then the remaining puzzle is solved by a single algorithm from a set of 5.\n\nb) L4E- L4E or last 4 edges is very similar to Layer by Layer. The only difference is that TWO edges are solved around three centers, and the rest is done by a set of algorithms.\n\nc) Intuitive L4E- A method similar to the L4E, as the name suggests, in which a lot of visualization is required. The set of algorithms mentioned in the previous method is not memorized. In speedsolving, cases are solved intuitively by anticipating the movement of pieces. This is the most advanced V first method.\n\nCommon top first methods-\n\na) One Flip- This method uses two edges around one center solved and the third edge flipped. There are a total of six cases after this step, for which algorithms are memorized and executed. The third step involves using a common set of algorithms for ALL top first methods, also called Keyhole last layer, which involves 5 algorithms, four of them being the mirrors of each other.\n\nb) Keyhole- This method uses two edges in the right place around one center, and the third edge does not match any color of the edge i.e. it is not in the right place OR flipped. The centers of the fourth color are then solved using the non-oriented edge (a.k.a. keyhole). The last step is solved using Keyhole last layer algorithms.\n\nc) OKA- In this method, one edge is oriented around two edges in the wrong place, but one of the edges that is in the wrong place belongs to the block itself. The last edge is found on the bottom layer, and a very simple algorithm is executed to get it in the right place, followed by keyhole last layer algorithms.\n\nSome other common top first methods are WO and Nutella.\n\nMany Pyraminx speedsolvers learn several methods, and while observing a case, decide which method best suits that case.<ref name=\"results\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2010BRAD01?tab=results-by-event&event=pyram - Drew Brads results.]</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Tetraminx.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A solved Tetraminx.]]\nThere are several variations of the puzzle. The simplest, '''Tetraminx''', is equivalent to the (3x) Pyraminx but without the tips (see photo).  There also exist \"higher-order\" versions, such as the 4x Master Pyraminx (see photos) and the 5x Professor's Pyraminx.\n\n[[File:MasterPyraminx-Scrambled.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A basic pattern on a Master Pyraminx]]\n[[File:MasterPyraminx-Solved.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A solved Master Pyraminx]]\nThe '''Master Pyraminx''' has 4 layers and 16 triangles-per-face (compared to 3 layers and 9 triangles-per-face of the original), and is based on the [[Skewb Diamond]] mechanism.

''Noblesse'' was first posted on [[Line Webtoon|Naver Webtoon]] on 30 December 2007, and was concluded on 7 January 2019; it was among the first webtoons to receive an English translation at the launch of Line Webtoon in July 2014. It has been adapted into a South Korean animation in 2015 and an [[original video animation]] (OVA) in 2016, and an anime television series by [[Production I.G]] is currently planned for production.\n\n==Plot==\n''Noblesse'' is about a powerful noble - Cadis Etrama Di Raizel (referred to as Rai) - who has been asleep for 820 years with no knowledge of mankind's advancement and scientific successes. At the start of the webtoon, Rai wakes up in an abandoned building in [[South Korea]],<ref name=chap6/> and starts to get used to the [[Contemporary history|modern world]]. He goes to a school, where he reunites with his loyal servant Frankenstein. With Frankenstein's help, Rai enrolls into high school and inadvertently befriends athletic teenager Shinwoo, computer geek Ikhan, and Shinwoo's crush Yuna, and a few others. ''Noblesse'' follows the group's often dangerous adventures against a secret organization while uncovering Rai's past.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Multiple issues|section=April 2017|\n{{in-universe|section|date=March 2016}}\n{{original research|section|date=March 2016}}\n}}\n'''Cadis Etrama Di Raizel (a.k.a. Rai)'''\n\nRai is a very charming, elegant, and mysterious Noble. He has no knowledge whatsoever of the 21st century, and will often become lost and confused especially with regards to modern-day technology (such as using a cell phone). He is often used as the manhwa's comic relief with his love of ramen, the errors he makes with technology, and his terrible sense of direction. He had fallen into a deep slumber for 820 years, and had woken up in an abandoned building in South Korea. After seeing what most of the humans on the streets were wearing, Rai took on the uniform of a student from Ye Ran High School, which is under the administration of Frankenstein, and inadvertently followed the students there.<ref name=\"chap1\" /> He currently resides with Frankenstein. He is shown to be extremely powerful with the ability of mind control, along with a technique called \"Blood Field,\" which is capable of erasing all traces of its victims' existence. Although he seems cold on the outside, Rai has shown an incredible depth of personal understanding and compassion, regardless of species, origin, or past grievances. Rai is extremely handsome and possesses a youthful appearance, scarlet-red eyes (a common trait among pureblood Nobles), beautiful jet black hair and a quiet disposition and he is usually seen wearing the Ye Ran High School uniform and a silver cross earring on his left ear (a gift from the previous Lord and an item that seals away the majority of his power). It seems that if Rai uses his powers extensively, his overall health and well-being deteriorate, as seen after the battle with the DA-5, although Rai said that it was nothing to worry about. Nevertheless, Frankenstein knows that his master needs time to fully recover his old strength. However, as said by Regis, even in his current state Rai possesses an enormous power comparable, if not superior, to that of the current Lord. During the confrontation between him and the Lord (during the Lukedonia Arc), Rai has shown superiority over the lord. Rai demonstrates his absolute governance over blood by creating powerful blood fields with perfect form without the use of an apparent soul weapon. Gejutel, an ancient advisor to Lord, explains that Rai's soul weapon does not materialize as a weapon; Rai's blood and soul is his soul weapon. Noblesse is the title of a single Noble (Rai), and was later adopted by Nobles as the name of their race, (some time after Rai went to sleep). In their society there are two beings who are held in high esteem: one is the Lord who rules with authority, and one is the Noblesse, with strength above all others, who watches over and protects the Nobles. The previous Lord left his soul weapon in the shrine of Reijar as a gift (although Rai cannot use Ragnarok because he is not related by blood to the previous Lord). Rai is shown to have relinquished his ownership of Ragnarok so that the current Lord can complete her soul weapon Ragnarok. Rai's power consumes his life force when used. Frankenstein finally gets Rai to take a short hibernation, but as soon as he wakes up, he uses a great amount of power.\n;Frankenstein\nFrankenstein is Rai's devoted servant. He supports Rai whole-heartedly and calls him \"Master\".<ref name=chap6/> He had tried searching for his master after Rai disappeared and eventually went into [[seclusion]] to search for Rai privately. Frankenstein is the principal/director of Ye Ran High School, which he founded so that if Rai should return, Rai would be able to live a normal life. He was stunned to find Rai in his school office after Rai had woken up and assumed the [[uniform]] of the school's students. Frankenstein is immensely powerful. When he caused a disturbance in the world, the previous Lord sent two clan leaders (the Kertia and Landegre clan leaders) to capture him. Frankenstein is the only human to be acknowledged by the previous Lord because he exceeded human limitations and acquired power by his own means. Later, however, his powers had been sealed away by Rai due to misdeeds committed in pursuit of scientific knowledge and power. Frankenstein is a very cheerful person, but becomes quite serious and calculating when the situation calls for it, although during battles Frankenstein has shown a sadistic side. He is extremely organized and loathes messiness (especially in his house). Like Rai, he is very compassionate towards human beings, especially the students in his school. Frankenstein is an impressive scientist, who has researched human modification. All the research done was recorded down in his diaries, however one diary is now in the possession of Dr. Crombel and another in possession of the Union. His research is responsible for many of the advances humans made with modification. He was very familiar with the previous Lord, whom he calls \"old bugger.\" Frankenstein is actually human;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/noblesse/ep-190/viewer?title_no=87&episode_no=190|title=Noblesse - Ep. 190|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> gaining his strength and knowledge of human modification not by experimenting on others, but rather only on himself. Frankenstein has possession of Dark Spear, a human-created weapon modeled after Nobles' soul weapons. He created it from souls and Central Order knights who were experimented on and therefore bear a grudge towards Frankenstein. Consequently, Dark Spear constantly wishes to devour him.\n\n;Han Shinwoo (spelled Shinwu in English)\nShinwoo is an energetic and athletic teenager with bright red hair. He is always seen with a bandage over the bridge of his nose. He is well-known within the city for being skilled at martial arts and feared by gangs. He is on par at fighting the top level trained agents of the Union, those who have not been transformed. He fights the infected guy and causes very serious damage to him while receiving no significant damage from him. Shinwoo is often shown sleeping (and drooling) in class and slacking off. Though he is shown as a lazy student, he is very courageous and would protect his friends at all costs. Shinwoo is shown to be popular among the student body of Ye Ran High and other schools due to his superior fighting skills. At the beginning of volume 4, he was scouted by KSA to become a modified human because of that very reason. Shinwoo is hinted to have feelings towards Seira, who displays favor for him.\n\n;Woo Ikhan\nIkhan is Shinwoo and Yuna's childhood friend. He is extremely skilled in technology, especially computers and games. He has been shown in the series to be a highly skilled hacker. Ikhan has short brown hair and glasses and is 157&nbsp;cm (5.15&nbsp;ft) tall. He has a height complex, being so short, but has found some comfort in meeting Regis, who is about the same height. He has started to become infatuated with their friend Sui Lim. His computer skills showed to be his utmost talent and became useful in certain situations. He protects the intel of the local police manned by his uncle, in which the situation led him to meet the Union's assassin member: Tao. This talent of his also attracts the attention of the Korean government, as he was enlisted as a candidate for KSA recruitment.\n\n;Suh Yuna\nYuna is Shinwoo and Ikhan's childhood friend. Yuna rejected Shinwoo when he confessed to her two years ago. Yuna accidentally becomes the target of the infected guy when their paths cross one night. Yuna is a friendly, ordinary and sensible young woman, demonstrably more level-headed than her friends, who tend to sedately sit out, be amused by and often reminds them of the mundane reality behind their dramatics. When she and Rai are introduced to video games, she apparently is quite competent despite it being her first try. It has been hinted that she has a crush on M-21 after he becomes a guard at her high school.\n\n;Lim Sui\nSui is a pretty popular pop idol who is studying at Ye Ran High School. She first appeared in chapter 94 of the series; she returned to school after doing her concert. Sui is friends with Ikhan, Shinwoo and Yuna; she is always shown hanging out with the group. She later joined Shinwoo and the others in visiting Frankenstein's house regularly.\n\n===Nobles/Noblesse===\nThe Nobles are a race of nearly immortal, elegant and powerful beings. Although occasionally referred to as vampires, they are not in fact vampires. (Though they do have some of the traits typically thought of as vampiric traits, such as near immortality, exceptional speed, strength, and endurance, as well as the ability to create infected (\"mutant\") humans that are the true source of the vampire lore. Nobles do not require blood to survive, whereas the mutants do.) Due to their inability to ignore the slaughter of the weak, helpless [[Human beings|humans]], they have been guarding the latter against predators since ancient times. \"Noblesse\" was the title given to only one person, Rai, but the Nobles adopted it as the name for their race some time after Rai entered his long sleep. Pureblood Nobles seem to share crimson red eyes and a common power of [[mind control]].\n\nIn this series, the concept that we know of as \"Noblesse Oblige\" (a French term meaning \"nobility obligates\", implying those with power have the obligation to use it to help those without) historically stems from the behavior of the Noblesse (Rai), who protected the weak. People from the Union have thought Noblesse to be beings at the top of the race of the vampires. It is later known, however, that \"vampires\" are what humans perceive to be infected beings created when Nobles \"awaken\" humans and those humans share the power to create other vampires. These \"infected\" are often understood to be less sensible, often relying on instinct in the consumption of human blood.\n\n==Animation==\n{{tone|section|date=March 2016}}\n\n=== 2015 animation===\nThe first [[animation|animated]] version of ''Noblesse'' was revealed at the 17th Bucheon International Animation Festival.

''Noblesse'' was first posted on [[Line Webtoon|Naver Webtoon]] on 30 December 2007, and was concluded on 7 January 2019; it was among the first webtoons to receive an English translation at the launch of Line Webtoon in July 2014. It has been adapted into a South Korean animation in 2015 and an [[original video animation]] (OVA) in 2016, and an anime television series by [[Production I.G]] is currently planned for production.\n\n==Plot==\n''Noblesse'' is about a powerful noble - Cadis Etrama Di Raizel (referred to as Rai) - who has been asleep for 820 years with no knowledge of mankind's advancement and scientific successes. At the start of the webtoon, Rai wakes up in an abandoned building in [[South Korea]],<ref name=chap6/> and starts to get used to the [[Contemporary history|modern world]]. He goes to a school, where he reunites with his loyal servant Frankenstein. With Frankenstein's help, Rai enrolls into high school and inadvertently befriends athletic teenager Shinwoo, computer geek Ikhan, and Shinwoo's crush Yuna, and a few others. ''Noblesse'' follows the group's often dangerous adventures against a secret organization while uncovering Rai's past.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Multiple issues|section=April 2017|\n{{in-universe|section|date=March 2016}}\n{{original research|section|date=March 2016}}\n}}\n'''Cadis Etrama Di Raizel (a.k.a. Rai)'''\n\nRai is a very charming, elegant, and mysterious Noble. He has no knowledge whatsoever of the 21st century, and will often become lost and confused especially with regards to modern-day technology (such as using a cell phone). He is often used as the manhwa's comic relief with his love of ramen, the errors he makes with technology, and his terrible sense of direction. He had fallen into a deep slumber for 820 years, and had woken up in an abandoned building in South Korea. After seeing what most of the humans on the streets were wearing, Rai took on the uniform of a student from Ye Ran High School, which is under the administration of Frankenstein, and inadvertently followed the students there.<ref name=\"chap1\" /> He currently resides with Frankenstein. He is shown to be extremely powerful with the ability of mind control, along with a technique called \"Blood Field,\" which is capable of erasing all traces of its victims' existence. Although he seems cold on the outside, Rai has shown an incredible depth of personal understanding and compassion, regardless of species, origin, or past grievances. Rai is extremely handsome and possesses a youthful appearance, scarlet-red eyes (a common trait among pureblood Nobles), beautiful jet black hair and a quiet disposition and he is usually seen wearing the Ye Ran High School uniform and a silver cross earring on his left ear (a gift from the previous Lord and an item that seals away the majority of his power). It seems that if Rai uses his powers extensively, his overall health and well-being deteriorate, as seen after the battle with the DA-5, although Rai said that it was nothing to worry about. Nevertheless, Frankenstein knows that his master needs time to fully recover his old strength. However, as said by Regis, even in his current state Rai possesses an enormous power comparable, if not superior, to that of the current Lord. During the confrontation between him and the Lord (during the Lukedonia Arc), Rai has shown superiority over the lord. Rai demonstrates his absolute governance over blood by creating powerful blood fields with perfect form without the use of an apparent soul weapon. Gejutel, an ancient advisor to Lord, explains that Rai's soul weapon does not materialize as a weapon; Rai's blood and soul is his soul weapon. Noblesse is the title of a single Noble (Rai), and was later adopted by Nobles as the name of their race, (some time after Rai went to sleep). In their society there are two beings who are held in high esteem: one is the Lord who rules with authority, and one is the Noblesse, with strength above all others, who watches over and protects the Nobles. The previous Lord left his soul weapon in the shrine of Reijar as a gift (although Rai cannot use Ragnarok because he is not related by blood to the previous Lord). Rai is shown to have relinquished his ownership of Ragnarok so that the current Lord can complete her soul weapon Ragnarok. Rai's power consumes his life force when used. Frankenstein finally gets Rai to take a short hibernation, but as soon as he wakes up, he uses a great amount of power.\n;Frankenstein\nFrankenstein is Rai's devoted servant. He supports Rai whole-heartedly and calls him \"Master\".<ref name=chap6/> He had tried searching for his master after Rai disappeared and eventually went into [[seclusion]] to search for Rai privately. Frankenstein is the principal/director of Ye Ran High School, which he founded so that if Rai should return, Rai would be able to live a normal life. He was stunned to find Rai in his school office after Rai had woken up and assumed the [[uniform]] of the school's students. Frankenstein is immensely powerful. When he caused a disturbance in the world, the previous Lord sent two clan leaders (the Kertia and Landegre clan leaders) to capture him. Frankenstein is the only human to be acknowledged by the previous Lord because he exceeded human limitations and acquired power by his own means. Later, however, his powers had been sealed away by Rai due to misdeeds committed in pursuit of scientific knowledge and power. Frankenstein is a very cheerful person, but becomes quite serious and calculating when the situation calls for it, although during battles Frankenstein has shown a sadistic side. He is extremely organized and loathes messiness (especially in his house). Like Rai, he is very compassionate towards human beings, especially the students in his school. Frankenstein is an impressive scientist, who has researched human modification. All the research done was recorded down in his diaries, however one diary is now in the possession of Dr. Crombel and another in possession of the Union. His research is responsible for many of the advances humans made with modification. He was very familiar with the previous Lord, whom he calls \"old bugger.\" Frankenstein is actually human;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/noblesse/ep-190/viewer?title_no=87&episode_no=190|title=Noblesse - Ep. 190|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> gaining his strength and knowledge of human modification not by experimenting on others, but rather only on himself. Frankenstein has possession of Dark Spear, a human-created weapon modeled after Nobles' soul weapons. He created it from souls and Central Order knights who were experimented on and therefore bear a grudge towards Frankenstein. Consequently, Dark Spear constantly wishes to devour him.\n\n;Shinwoo Han (spelled Shinwu in English)\nShinwoo is an energetic and athletic teenager with bright red hair. He is always seen with a bandage over the bridge of his nose. He is well-known within the city for being skilled at martial arts and feared by gangs. He is on par at fighting the top level trained agents of the Union, those who have not been transformed. He fights the infected guy and causes very serious damage to him while receiving no significant damage from him. Shinwoo is often shown sleeping (and drooling) in class and slacking off. Though he is shown as a lazy student, he is very courageous and would protect his friends at all costs. Shinwoo is shown to be popular among the student body of Ye Ran High and other schools due to his superior fighting skills. At the beginning of volume 4, he was scouted by KSA to become a modified human because of that very reason. Shinwoo is hinted to have feelings towards Seira, who displays favor for him.\n\n;Ikhan Woo\nIkhan is Shinwoo and Yuna's childhood friend. He is extremely skilled in technology, especially computers and games. He has been shown in the series to be a highly skilled hacker. Ikhan has short brown hair and glasses and is 157&nbsp;cm (5.15&nbsp;ft) tall. He has a height complex, being so short, but has found some comfort in meeting Regis, who is about the same height. He has started to become infatuated with their friend Sui Lim. His computer skills showed to be his utmost talent and became useful in certain situations. He protects the intel of the local police manned by his uncle, in which the situation led him to meet the Union's assassin member: Tao. This talent of his also attracts the attention of the Korean government, as he was enlisted as a candidate for KSA recruitment.\n\n;Yuna Suh\nYuna is Shinwoo and Ikhan's childhood friend. Yuna rejected Shinwoo when he confessed to her two years ago. Yuna accidentally becomes the target of the infected guy when their paths cross one night. Yuna is a friendly, ordinary and sensible young woman, demonstrably more level-headed than her friends, who tend to sedately sit out, be amused by and often reminds them of the mundane reality behind their dramatics. When she and Rai are introduced to video games, she apparently is quite competent despite it being her first try. It has been hinted that she has a crush on M-21 after he becomes a guard at her high school.\n\n;Sui Lim\nSui is a pretty popular pop idol who is studying at Ye Ran High School. She first appeared in chapter 94 of the series; she returned to school after doing her concert. Sui is friends with Ikhan, Shinwoo and Yuna; she is always shown hanging out with the group. She later joined Shinwoo and the others in visiting Frankenstein's house regularly.\n\n===Nobles/Noblesse===\nThe Nobles are a race of nearly immortal, elegant and powerful beings. Although occasionally referred to as vampires, they are not in fact vampires. (Though they do have some of the traits typically thought of as vampiric traits, such as near immortality, exceptional speed, strength, and endurance, as well as the ability to create infected (\"mutant\") humans that are the true source of the vampire lore. Nobles do not require blood to survive, whereas the mutants do.) Due to their inability to ignore the slaughter of the weak, helpless [[Human beings|humans]], they have been guarding the latter against predators since ancient times. \"Noblesse\" was the title given to only one person, Rai, but the Nobles adopted it as the name for their race some time after Rai entered his long sleep. Pureblood Nobles seem to share crimson red eyes and a common power of [[mind control]].\n\nIn this series, the concept that we know of as \"Noblesse Oblige\" (a French term meaning \"nobility obligates\", implying those with power have the obligation to use it to help those without) historically stems from the behavior of the Noblesse (Rai), who protected the weak. People from the Union have thought Noblesse to be beings at the top of the race of the vampires. It is later known, however, that \"vampires\" are what humans perceive to be infected beings created when Nobles \"awaken\" humans and those humans share the power to create other vampires. These \"infected\" are often understood to be less sensible, often relying on instinct in the consumption of human blood.\n\n==Animation==\n{{tone|section|date=March 2016}}\n\n=== 2015 animation===\nThe first [[animation|animated]] version of ''Noblesse'' was revealed at the 17th Bucheon International Animation Festival.

The term '''Arthropoda''' as originally proposed refers to a proposed grouping of Euarthropods and the phylum [[Onychophora]].\n\nArthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and [[Arthropod cuticle|cuticle]] made of [[chitin]], often [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralised]] with [[calcium carbonate]]. The arthropod [[body plan]] consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by [[moulting]]. Arthropods are bilaterally symmetrical and their body possesses an [[exoskeleton|external skeleton]]. Some species have wings.\n\nTheir versatility has enabled arthropods to become the most species-rich members of all [[Guild (ecology)|ecological guilds]] in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80 percent of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most other animals, are very successful in dry environments. Arthropods range in size from the microscopic crustacean ''[[Stygotantulus]]'' up to the [[Japanese spider crab]].\n\nAn arthropods' primary internal cavity is a [[haemocoel]], which accommodates their internal [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and through which their [[haemolymph]] \u2013 analogue of [[blood]] \u2013 circulates; they have [[Circulatory system#Open circulatory system|open circulatory systems]]. Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments. Their [[nervous system]] is \"ladder-like\", with paired [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] [[Ventral nerve cord|nerve cords]] running through all segments and forming paired [[ganglia]] in each segment. Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their [[brain]]s are formed by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the [[esophagus]]. The [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[excretion|excretory]] systems of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the [[subphylum]] to which they belong. \n\nTheir vision relies on various combinations of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-pit [[ocelli]]: in most species the ocelli can only detect the direction from which light is coming, and the compound eyes are the main source of information, but the main eyes of [[spider]]s are ocelli that can form images and, in a few cases, can swivel to track prey. Arthropods also have a wide range of chemical and mechanical sensors, mostly based on modifications of the many bristles known as [[seta]]e that project through their cuticles.\n\nArthropods' methods of reproduction and development are diverse; all terrestrial species use [[internal fertilization]], but this is often by indirect transfer of the sperm via an appendage or the ground, rather than by direct injection. Aquatic species use either internal or [[external fertilization]]. Almost all arthropods lay eggs, but [[scorpion]]s give birth to live young after the eggs have hatched inside the mother. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs and [[caterpillar]]s that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total [[metamorphosis]] to produce the adult form. The level of maternal care for hatchlings varies from nonexistent to the prolonged care provided by scorpions.\n\nThe evolutionary ancestry of arthropods dates back to the [[Cambrian]] period. The group is generally regarded as [[monophyletic]], and many analyses support the placement of arthropods with [[cycloneuralia]]ns (or their constituent clades) in a superphylum [[Ecdysozoa]]. Overall, however, the [[basal (evolution)|basal]] relationships of animals are not yet well resolved. Likewise, the relationships between various arthropod groups are still actively debated. \n\nArthropods contribute to the human food supply both directly as food, and more importantly indirectly as [[pollination|pollinators]] of crops. Some species are known to spread severe disease to humans, [[livestock]], and crops.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word ''arthropod'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|\u1f04\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}} ''\u00e1rthron'', \"[[joint]]\", and {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2}} ''pous'' ([[genitive|gen.]] ''podos (\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2)''), i.e. \"foot\" or \"[[leg]]\", which together mean \"jointed leg\".<ref name=OnlineEtDict>{{cite web|title=Arthropoda|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Arthropoda&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|access-date=2013-05-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307075628/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Arthropoda&allowed_in_frame=0|archive-date=2013-03-07|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n\nArthropods are [[invertebrate]]s with [[Segmentation (biology)|segmented]] bodies and jointed limbs.<ref>{{citation |author=Valentine, J.

Arthropods therefore replace their exoskeletons by undergoing [[ecdysis]] (moulting), or shedding the old exoskeleton after growing a new one that is not yet hardened. Moulting cycles run nearly continuously until an arthropod reaches full size.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 523\u2013524</ref>\n\nThe developmental stages between each moult (ecdysis) until sexual maturity is reached is called an [[instar]]. Differences between instars can often be seen in altered body proportions, colors, patterns, changes in the number of body segments or head width. After moulting, i.e. shedding their exoskeleton, the juvenile arthropods continue in their life cycle until they either pupate or moult again.\n\nIn the initial phase of moulting, the animal stops feeding and its epidermis releases moulting fluid, a mixture of [[enzyme]]s that digests the [[endocuticle]] and thus detaches the old cuticle. This phase begins when the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] has secreted a new [[epicuticle]] to protect it from the enzymes, and the epidermis secretes the new exocuticle while the old cuticle is detaching. When this stage is complete, the animal makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, and this makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest. It commonly takes several minutes for the animal to struggle out of the old cuticle. At this point, the new one is wrinkled and so soft that the animal cannot support itself and finds it very difficult to move, and the new endocuticle has not yet formed. The animal continues to pump itself up to stretch the new cuticle as much as possible, then hardens the new exocuticle and eliminates the excess air or water. By the end of this phase, the new endocuticle has formed. Many arthropods then eat the discarded cuticle to reclaim its materials.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\" />\n\nBecause arthropods are unprotected and nearly immobilized until the new cuticle has hardened, they are in danger both of being trapped in the old cuticle and of being attacked by predators. Moulting may be responsible for 80 to 90% of all arthropod deaths.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\" />\n\n=== Internal organs ===\n{{Annotated image/Basic arthropod internal structure}}\nArthropod bodies are also segmented internally, and the nervous, muscular, circulatory, and excretory systems have repeated components.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P518\" /> Arthropods come from a lineage of animals that have a [[coelom]], a membrane-lined cavity between the gut and the body wall that accommodates the internal organs. The strong, segmented limbs of arthropods eliminate the need for one of the coelom's main ancestral functions, as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], which muscles compress in order to change the animal's shape and thus enable it to move. Hence the coelom of the arthropod is reduced to small areas around the reproductive and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a [[hemocoel]], a cavity that runs most of the length of the body and through which [[blood]] flows.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 527\u2013528</ref>\n\n=== Respiration and circulation ===\n{{See also|Hemolymph|hemocyte}}\nArthropods have open [[circulatory system]]s, although most have a few short, open-ended [[artery|arteries]]. In chelicerates and crustaceans, the blood carries [[oxygen]] to the tissues, while [[hexapoda|hexapods]] use a separate system of [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheae]]. Many crustaceans, but few chelicerates and [[tracheata|tracheates]], use [[respiratory pigment]]s to assist oxygen transport. The most common respiratory pigment in arthropods is [[copper]]-based [[hemocyanin]]; this is used by many crustaceans and a few [[centipede]]s. A few crustaceans and insects use iron-based [[hemoglobin]], the respiratory pigment used by [[vertebrate]]s. As with other invertebrates, the respiratory pigments of those arthropods that have them are generally dissolved in the blood and rarely enclosed in [[Blood cell|corpuscles]] as they are in vertebrates.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\" />\n\nThe heart is typically a muscular tube that runs just under the back and for most of the length of the hemocoel. It contracts in ripples that run from rear to front, pushing blood forwards. Sections not being squeezed by the heart muscle are expanded either by elastic [[ligament]]s or by small [[muscle]]s, in either case connecting the heart to the body wall. Along the heart run a series of paired ostia, non-return valves that allow blood to enter the heart but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\" />\n\nArthropods have a wide variety of respiratory systems. Small species often do not have any, since their high ratio of surface area to volume enables simple diffusion through the body surface to supply enough oxygen. Crustacea usually have gills that are modified appendages. Many arachnids have [[book lung]]s.<ref name=\"Garwood\" /> Tracheae, systems of branching tunnels that run from the openings in the body walls, deliver oxygen directly to individual cells in many insects, myriapods and [[arachnid]]s.<ref>[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 530, 733</ref>\n\n=== Nervous system ===\nLiving arthropods have paired main nerve cords running along their bodies below the gut, and in each segment the cords form a pair of [[ganglia]] from which [[sensory nerve|sensory]] and [[motor nerve|motor]] nerves run to other parts of the segment. Although the pairs of ganglia in each segment often appear physically fused, they are connected by [[commissure]]s (relatively large bundles of nerves), which give arthropod nervous systems a characteristic \"ladder-like\" appearance. The brain is in the head, encircling and mainly ''above'' the esophagus. It consists of the fused ganglia of the acron and one or two of the foremost segments that form the head&nbsp;\u2013 a total of three pairs of ganglia in most arthropods, but only two in chelicerates, which do not have antennae or the ganglion connected to them. The ganglia of other head segments are often close to the brain and function as part of it. In insects these other head ganglia combine into a pair of [[subesophageal ganglia]], under and behind the esophagus. Spiders take this process a step further, as ''all'' the [[segmental ganglia]] are incorporated into the subesophageal ganglia, which occupy most of the space in the cephalothorax (front \"super-segment\").<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P531To532\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 531\u2013532</ref>\n\n=== Excretory system ===\nThere are two different types of arthropod excretory systems. In aquatic arthropods, the end-product of biochemical reactions that [[metabolism|metabolise]] [[nitrogen]] is [[ammonia]], which is so toxic that it needs to be diluted as much as possible with water. The ammonia is then eliminated via any permeable membrane, mainly through the gills.<ref name=\"Garwood\" /> All crustaceans use this system, and its high consumption of water may be responsible for the relative lack of success of crustaceans as land animals.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 529\u2013530</ref> Various groups of terrestrial arthropods have independently developed a different system: the end-product of nitrogen metabolism is [[uric acid]], which can be excreted as dry material; the [[Malpighian tubule system]] filters the uric acid and other nitrogenous waste out of the blood in the hemocoel, and dumps these materials into the hindgut, from which they are expelled as [[feces]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\" /> Most aquatic arthropods and some terrestrial ones also have organs called [[nephridia]] (\"little [[kidney]]s\"), which extract other wastes for excretion as [[urine]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\" />\n\n=== Senses ===\n\n==== Optical ====\n{{main|Arthropod eye}}\nThe stiff [[cuticle]]s of arthropods would block out information about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly [[seta]]e, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of [[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]], often by means of setae. Pressure sensors often take the form of membranes that function as [[eardrum]]s, but are connected directly to nerves rather than to [[auditory ossicle]]s. The [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] of most hexapods include sensor packages that monitor [[humidity]], moisture and temperature.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 532\u2013537</ref>\n\n[[File:Wasp ocelli.JPG|240px|thumb|right|Head of a [[wasp]] with three ocelli (center), and compound eyes at the left and right]]\nMost arthropods have sophisticated visual systems that include one or more usually both of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-cup [[ocelli]] (\"little eyes\"). In most cases ocelli are only capable of detecting the direction from which light is coming, using the shadow cast by the walls of the cup. However, the main eyes of [[spider]]s are pigment-cup ocelli that are capable of forming images,<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\" /> and those of [[jumping spider]]s can rotate to track prey.<ref>[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 578\u2013580</ref>\n\nCompound eyes consist of fifteen to several thousand independent [[ommatidia]], columns that are usually [[hexagon]]al in [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]].

Proponents of polyphyly argued the following: that the similarities between these groups are the results of [[convergent evolution]], as natural consequences of having rigid, segmented [[exoskeleton]]s; that the three groups use different chemical means of hardening the cuticle; that there were significant differences in the construction of their compound eyes; that it is hard to see how such different configurations of segments and appendages in the head could have evolved from the same ancestor; and that crustaceans have [[biramous]] limbs with separate gill and leg branches, while the other two groups have [[uniramous]] limbs in which the single branch serves as a leg.<ref>{{citation |author=Gillott, C. |title=Entomology |pages=17\u201319 |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-306-44967-3}}</ref>\n<div style=\"float:right; width:auto; max-width:100%; border:solid 1px silver; padding:2px; margin:2px; font-size:80%;\">\n<div style=\"width:auto; border:solid 1px silver; padding:5px\">\n{{clade\n |1={{clade\n    |1=[[onychophora]]ns,<br />including ''[[Aysheaia]]'' and ''[[Peripatus]]''\n    |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n          |1=armored [[lobopod]]s,<br />including ''[[Hallucigenia]]'' and ''[[Microdictyon]]''\n          |2={{clade\n              |1=[[anomalocarid]]-like taxa,<br />including modern [[tardigrade]]s as<br />well as extinct animals like<br />''[[Kerygmachela]]'' and ''[[Opabinia]]''\n              |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Anomalocaris]]''\n                  |2=arthropods,<br />including living groups and<br />extinct forms such as [[trilobite]]s\n                 }}\n             }}\n         }}\n       }}\n    }}\n}}\n</div>Simplified summary of Budd's \"broad-scale\" cladogram (1996)<ref name=\"Budd1996\" /></div>\nFurther analysis and discoveries in the 1990s reversed this view, and led to acceptance that arthropods are [[monophyletic]], in other words they do share a common ancestor that was itself an arthropod.<ref>{{citation |author=Adrain, J. |title=Book Review: Arthropod Fossils and Phylogeny, edited by Gregory D.

The earliest known arthropods ate mud in order to extract food particles from it, and possessed variable numbers of segments with unspecialized appendages that functioned as both gills and legs. Anomalocarids were, by the standards of the time, huge and sophisticated predators with specialized mouths and grasping appendages, fixed numbers of segments some of which were specialized, tail fins, and gills that were very different from those of arthropods.

There had been competing proposals that arthropods were closely related to other groups such as [[nematode]]s, [[priapulid]]s and [[tardigrade]]s, but these remained minority views because it was difficult to specify in detail the relationships between these groups.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic]] analyses of [[DNA]] sequences produced a coherent scheme showing arthropods as members of a [[superphylum]] labelled Ecdysozoa (\"animals that moult\"), which contained nematodes, priapulids and tardigrades but excluded annelids. This was backed up by studies of the anatomy and development of these animals, which showed that many of the features that supported the Articulata hypothesis showed significant differences between annelids and the earliest Panarthropods in their details, and some were hardly present at all in arthropods. This hypothesis groups annelids with molluscs and [[brachiopod]]s in another superphylum, [[Lophotrochozoa]].\n\nIf the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is correct, then segmentation of arthropods and annelids either has evolved [[Convergent evolution|convergently]] or has been inherited from a much older ancestor and subsequently lost in several other lineages, such as the non-arthropod members of the Ecdysozoa.<ref>{{citation |author1=Schmidt-Rhaesa, A. |author2=Bartolomaeus, T. |author3=Lemburg, C. |author4=Ehlers, U. |author5=Garey, J.

The term '''Arthropoda''' as originally proposed refers to a proposed grouping of Euarthropods and the phylum [[Onychophora]].\n\nArthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and [[Arthropod cuticle|cuticle]] made of [[chitin]], often [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralised]] with [[calcium carbonate]]. The arthropod [[body plan]] consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by [[moulting]]. Arthropods are bilaterally symmetrical and their body possesses an [[exoskeleton|external skeleton]]. Some species have wings.\n\nTheir versatility has enabled arthropods to become the most species-rich members of all [[Guild (ecology)|ecological guilds]] in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80 percent of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most other animals, are very successful in dry environments. Arthropods range in size from the microscopic crustacean ''[[Stygotantulus]]'' up to the [[Japanese spider crab]].\n\nAn arthropods' primary internal cavity is a [[haemocoel]], which accommodates their internal [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], and through which their [[haemolymph]] \u2013 analogue of [[blood]] \u2013 circulates; they have [[Circulatory system#Open circulatory system|open circulatory systems]]. Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments. Their [[nervous system]] is \"ladder-like\", with paired [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] [[Ventral nerve cord|nerve cords]] running through all segments and forming paired [[ganglia]] in each segment. Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their [[brain]]s are formed by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the [[esophagus]]. The [[respiratory system|respiratory]] and [[excretion|excretory]] systems of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the [[subphylum]] to which they belong. \n\nTheir vision relies on various combinations of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-pit [[ocelli]]: in most species the ocelli can only detect the direction from which light is coming, and the compound eyes are the main source of information, but the main eyes of [[spider]]s are ocelli that can form images and, in a few cases, can swivel to track prey. Arthropods also have a wide range of chemical and mechanical sensors, mostly based on modifications of the many bristles known as [[seta]]e that project through their cuticles.\n\nArthropods' methods of reproduction and development are diverse; all terrestrial species use [[internal fertilization]], but this is often by indirect transfer of the sperm via an appendage or the ground, rather than by direct injection. Aquatic species use either internal or [[external fertilization]]. Almost all arthropods lay eggs, but [[scorpion]]s give birth to live young after the eggs have hatched inside the mother. Arthropod hatchlings vary from miniature adults to grubs and [[caterpillar]]s that lack jointed limbs and eventually undergo a total [[metamorphosis]] to produce the adult form. The level of maternal care for hatchlings varies from nonexistent to the prolonged care provided by scorpions.\n\nThe evolutionary ancestry of arthropods dates back to the [[Cambrian]] period. The group is generally regarded as [[monophyletic]], and many analyses support the placement of arthropods with [[cycloneuralia]]ns (or their constituent clades) in a superphylum [[Ecdysozoa]]. Overall, however, the [[basal (evolution)|basal]] relationships of animals are not yet well resolved. Likewise, the relationships between various arthropod groups are still actively debated. \n\nArthropods contribute to the human food supply both directly as food, and more importantly indirectly as [[pollination|pollinators]] of crops. Some species are known to spread severe disease to humans, [[livestock]], and crops.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word ''arthropod'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|\u1f04\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd}} ''\u00e1rthron'', \"[[joint]]\", and {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2}} ''pous'' ([[genitive|gen.]] ''podos (\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2)''), i.e. \"foot\" or \"[[leg]]\", which together mean \"jointed leg\".<ref name=OnlineEtDict>{{cite web|title=Arthropoda|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Arthropoda&allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|access-date=2013-05-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307075628/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Arthropoda&allowed_in_frame=0|archive-date=2013-03-07|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n\nArthropods are [[invertebrate]]s with [[Segmentation (biology)|segmented]] bodies and jointed limbs.<ref>{{citation |author=Valentine, J.

Setae are as varied in form and function as appendages. For example, they are often used as sensors to detect air or water currents, or contact with objects; aquatic arthropods use [[feather]]-like setae to increase the surface area of swimming appendages and to [[filter feeding|filter]] food particles out of water; aquatic insects, which are air-breathers, use thick [[felt]]-like coats of setae to trap air, extending the time they can spend under water; heavy, rigid setae serve as defensive spines.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P518\" />\n\nAlthough all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, some still use [[hydraulic]] pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors;<ref>{{citation |author1=Barnes, R.

Arthropods therefore replace their exoskeletons by undergoing [[ecdysis]] (moulting), or shedding the old exoskeleton after growing a new one that is not yet hardened. Moulting cycles run nearly continuously until an arthropod reaches full size.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 523\u2013524</ref>\n\nThe developmental stages between each moult (ecdysis) until sexual maturity is reached is called an [[instar]]. Differences between instars can often be seen in altered body proportions, colors, patterns, changes in the number of body segments or head width. After moulting, i.e. shedding their exoskeleton, the juvenile arthropods continue in their life cycle until they either pupate or moult again.\n\nIn the initial phase of moulting, the animal stops feeding and its epidermis releases moulting fluid, a mixture of [[enzyme]]s that digests the [[endocuticle]] and thus detaches the old cuticle. This phase begins when the [[epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] has secreted a new [[epicuticle]] to protect it from the enzymes, and the epidermis secretes the new exocuticle while the old cuticle is detaching. When this stage is complete, the animal makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, and this makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest. It commonly takes several minutes for the animal to struggle out of the old cuticle. At this point, the new one is wrinkled and so soft that the animal cannot support itself and finds it very difficult to move, and the new endocuticle has not yet formed. The animal continues to pump itself up to stretch the new cuticle as much as possible, then hardens the new exocuticle and eliminates the excess air or water. By the end of this phase, the new endocuticle has formed. Many arthropods then eat the discarded cuticle to reclaim its materials.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\" />\n\nBecause arthropods are unprotected and nearly immobilized until the new cuticle has hardened, they are in danger both of being trapped in the old cuticle and of being attacked by predators. Moulting may be responsible for 80 to 90% of all arthropod deaths.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524\" />\n\n=== Internal organs ===\n{{Annotated image/Basic arthropod internal structure}}\nArthropod bodies are also segmented internally, and the nervous, muscular, circulatory, and excretory systems have repeated components.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P518\" /> Arthropods come from a lineage of animals that have a [[coelom]], a membrane-lined cavity between the gut and the body wall that accommodates the internal organs. The strong, segmented limbs of arthropods eliminate the need for one of the coelom's main ancestral functions, as a [[hydrostatic skeleton]], which muscles compress in order to change the animal's shape and thus enable it to move. Hence the coelom of the arthropod is reduced to small areas around the reproductive and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a [[hemocoel]], a cavity that runs most of the length of the body and through which [[blood]] flows.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 527\u2013528</ref>\n\n=== Respiration and circulation ===\n{{See also|Hemolymph|hemocyte}}\nArthropods have open [[circulatory system]]s, although most have a few short, open-ended [[artery|arteries]]. In chelicerates and crustaceans, the blood carries [[oxygen]] to the tissues, while [[hexapoda|hexapods]] use a separate system of [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheae]]. Many crustaceans, but few chelicerates and [[tracheata|tracheates]], use [[respiratory pigment]]s to assist oxygen transport. The most common respiratory pigment in arthropods is [[copper]]-based [[hemocyanin]]; this is used by many crustaceans and a few [[centipede]]s. A few crustaceans and insects use iron-based [[hemoglobin]], the respiratory pigment used by [[vertebrate]]s. As with other invertebrates, the respiratory pigments of those arthropods that have them are generally dissolved in the blood and rarely enclosed in [[Blood cell|corpuscles]] as they are in vertebrates.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\" />\n\nThe heart is typically a muscular tube that runs just under the back and for most of the length of the hemocoel. It contracts in ripples that run from rear to front, pushing blood forwards. Sections not being squeezed by the heart muscle are expanded either by elastic [[ligament]]s or by small [[muscle]]s, in either case connecting the heart to the body wall. Along the heart run a series of paired ostia, non-return valves that allow blood to enter the heart but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P527To528\" />\n\nArthropods have a wide variety of respiratory systems. Small species often do not have any, since their high ratio of surface area to volume enables simple diffusion through the body surface to supply enough oxygen. Crustacea usually have gills that are modified appendages. Many arachnids have [[book lung]]s.<ref name=\"Garwood\" /> Tracheae, systems of branching tunnels that run from the openings in the body walls, deliver oxygen directly to individual cells in many insects, myriapods and [[arachnid]]s.<ref>[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 530, 733</ref>\n\n=== Nervous system ===\nLiving arthropods have paired main nerve cords running along their bodies below the gut, and in each segment the cords form a pair of [[ganglia]] from which [[sensory nerve|sensory]] and [[motor nerve|motor]] nerves run to other parts of the segment. Although the pairs of ganglia in each segment often appear physically fused, they are connected by [[commissure]]s (relatively large bundles of nerves), which give arthropod nervous systems a characteristic \"ladder-like\" appearance. The brain is in the head, encircling and mainly ''above'' the esophagus. It consists of the fused ganglia of the acron and one or two of the foremost segments that form the head&nbsp;\u2013 a total of three pairs of ganglia in most arthropods, but only two in chelicerates, which do not have antennae or the ganglion connected to them. The ganglia of other head segments are often close to the brain and function as part of it. In insects these other head ganglia combine into a pair of [[subesophageal ganglia]], under and behind the esophagus. Spiders take this process a step further, as ''all'' the [[segmental ganglia]] are incorporated into the subesophageal ganglia, which occupy most of the space in the cephalothorax (front \"super-segment\").<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P531To532\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 531\u2013532</ref>\n\n=== Excretory system ===\nThere are two different types of arthropod excretory systems. In aquatic arthropods, the end-product of biochemical reactions that [[metabolism|metabolise]] [[nitrogen]] is [[ammonia]], which is so toxic that it needs to be diluted as much as possible with water. The ammonia is then eliminated via any permeable membrane, mainly through the gills.<ref name=\"Garwood\" /> All crustaceans use this system, and its high consumption of water may be responsible for the relative lack of success of crustaceans as land animals.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 529\u2013530</ref> Various groups of terrestrial arthropods have independently developed a different system: the end-product of nitrogen metabolism is [[uric acid]], which can be excreted as dry material; the [[Malpighian tubule system]] filters the uric acid and other nitrogenous waste out of the blood in the hemocoel, and dumps these materials into the hindgut, from which they are expelled as [[feces]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\" /> Most aquatic arthropods and some terrestrial ones also have organs called [[nephridia]] (\"little [[kidney]]s\"), which extract other wastes for excretion as [[urine]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P529To530\" />\n\n=== Senses ===\n\n==== Optical ====\n{{main|Arthropod eye}}\nThe stiff [[cuticle]]s of arthropods would block out information about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly [[seta]]e, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of [[taste]] and [[Olfaction|smell]], often by means of setae. Pressure sensors often take the form of membranes that function as [[eardrum]]s, but are connected directly to nerves rather than to [[auditory ossicle]]s. The [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] of most hexapods include sensor packages that monitor [[humidity]], moisture and temperature.<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\">[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 532\u2013537</ref>\n\n[[File:Wasp ocelli.JPG|240px|thumb|right|Head of a [[wasp]] with three ocelli (center), and compound eyes at the left and right]]\nMost arthropods have sophisticated visual systems that include one or more usually both of [[compound eye]]s and pigment-cup [[ocelli]] (\"little eyes\"). In most cases ocelli are only capable of detecting the direction from which light is coming, using the shadow cast by the walls of the cup. However, the main eyes of [[spider]]s are pigment-cup ocelli that are capable of forming images,<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\" /> and those of [[jumping spider]]s can rotate to track prey.<ref>[[#refRuppert|Ruppert, Fox & Barnes (2004)]], pp. 578\u2013580</ref>\n\nCompound eyes consist of fifteen to several thousand independent [[ommatidia]], columns that are usually [[hexagon]]al in [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]. Each ommatidium is an independent sensor, with its own light-sensitive cells and often with its own [[lens (anatomy)|lens]] and [[cornea]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\" /> Compound eyes have a wide field of view, and can detect fast movement and, in some cases, the [[light polarization|polarization of light]].<ref>{{citation\n |url=http://www.suss-microoptics.com/downloads/Publications/Miniaturized_Imaging_Systems.pdf \n |doi=10.1016/S0167-9317(03)00102-3 \n |title=Miniaturized imaging systems \n |author1=V\u00f6lkel, R. \n |author2=Eisner, M. \n |author3=Weible, K.

The self-righting behavior of [[cockroach]]es is triggered when pressure sensors on the underside of the feet report no pressure. However, many [[malacostracan]] crustaceans have [[statocyst]]s, which provide the same sort of information as the balance and motion sensors of the vertebrate [[inner ear]].<ref name=\"RuppertFoxBarnes2004P532To537\" />\n\nThe [[proprioceptor]]s of arthropods, sensors that report the force exerted by muscles and the degree of bending in the body and joints, are well understood.

[[Opiliones]] (harvestmen), [[millipede]]s, and some crustaceans use modified appendages such as [[gonopod]]s or [[Opiliones penis|penises]] to transfer the sperm directly to the female. However, most male [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] arthropods produce [[spermatophore]]s, waterproof packets of [[sperm]], which the females take into their bodies.

Instead, they proposed that three separate groups of \"arthropods\" evolved separately from common worm-like ancestors: the [[chelicerate]]s, including [[spider]]s and [[scorpion]]s; the crustaceans; and the [[uniramia]], consisting of [[onychophoran]]s, [[myriapod]]s and [[hexapoda|hexapods]]. These arguments usually bypassed [[trilobite]]s, as the evolutionary relationships of this class were unclear. Proponents of polyphyly argued the following: that the similarities between these groups are the results of [[convergent evolution]], as natural consequences of having rigid, segmented [[exoskeleton]]s; that the three groups use different chemical means of hardening the cuticle; that there were significant differences in the construction of their compound eyes; that it is hard to see how such different configurations of segments and appendages in the head could have evolved from the same ancestor; and that crustaceans have [[biramous]] limbs with separate gill and leg branches, while the other two groups have [[uniramous]] limbs in which the single branch serves as a leg.<ref>{{citation |author=Gillott, C. |title=Entomology |pages=17\u201319 |publisher=Springer |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-306-44967-3}}</ref>\n<div style=\"float:right; width:auto; max-width:100%; border:solid 1px silver; padding:2px; margin:2px; font-size:80%;\">\n<div style=\"width:auto; border:solid 1px silver; padding:5px\">\n{{clade\n |1={{clade\n    |1=[[onychophora]]ns,<br />including ''[[Aysheaia]]'' and ''[[Peripatus]]''\n    |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n          |1=armored [[lobopod]]s,<br />including ''[[Hallucigenia]]'' and ''[[Microdictyon]]''\n          |2={{clade\n              |1=[[anomalocarid]]-like taxa,<br />including modern [[tardigrade]]s as<br />well as extinct animals like<br />''[[Kerygmachela]]'' and ''[[Opabinia]]''\n              |2={{clade\n                  |1=''[[Anomalocaris]]''\n                  |2=arthropods,<br />including living groups and<br />extinct forms such as [[trilobite]]s\n                 }}\n             }}\n         }}\n       }}\n    }}\n}}\n</div>Simplified summary of Budd's \"broad-scale\" cladogram (1996)<ref name=\"Budd1996\" /></div>\nFurther analysis and discoveries in the 1990s reversed this view, and led to acceptance that arthropods are [[monophyletic]], in other words they do share a common ancestor that was itself an arthropod.<ref>{{citation |author=Adrain, J. |title=Book Review: Arthropod Fossils and Phylogeny, edited by Gregory D.

The earliest known arthropods ate mud in order to extract food particles from it, and possessed variable numbers of segments with unspecialized appendages that functioned as both gills and legs. Anomalocarids were, by the standards of the time, huge and sophisticated predators with specialized mouths and grasping appendages, fixed numbers of segments some of which were specialized, tail fins, and gills that were very different from those of arthropods. This reasoning implies that ''[[Parapeytoia]]'', which has legs and a backward-pointing mouth like that of the earliest arthropods, is a more credible closest relative of arthropods than is ''[[Anomalocaris]]''.<ref>{{citation |author1=Bergstr\u00f6m, J. |author2=Hou, X.-G. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Arthropod origins |journal=[[Bulletin of Geosciences]] |volume=78 |issue=4 |pages=323\u2013334 |year=2003 |url=http://www.geology.cz/bulletin/contents/2003/vol79no4/323_bergstrom.pdf |access-date=2008-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216220103/http://www.geology.cz/bulletin/contents/2003/vol79no4/323_bergstrom.pdf |archive-date=2008-12-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2006, they suggested that arthropods were more closely related to [[lobopod]]s and [[tardigrade]]s than to anomalocarids.<ref>{{citation |author1=Hou, X.-G. |author2=Bergstr\u00f6m, J. |author3=Jie, Y. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Distinguishing anomalocaridids from arthropods and priapulids |journal=[[Geological Journal]] |volume=41 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=259\u2013269 |year=2006 |doi=10.1002/gj.1050}}</ref> In 2014, research indicated that tardigrades were more closely related to arthropods than velvet worms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/misunderstood-worm-like-fossil-finds-its-place-in-the-tree-of-life|title=Misunderstood worm-like fossil finds its place in the Tree of Life|date=17 August 2014|access-date=24 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107150001/http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/misunderstood-worm-like-fossil-finds-its-place-in-the-tree-of-life|archive-date=7 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n<div style=\"float:right; width:auto; max-width:100%; border:solid 1px silver; padding:2px; margin:2px; font-size:80%;\">\n<div style=\"width:auto; border:solid 1px silver; padding:5px\">\n{{clade\n  |label1=[[Protostome]]s\n  |1={{clade\n|1=[[Chaetognatha]]\n|2={{clade\n       |1=[[Spiralia]] ([[annelid]]s, [[mollusc]]s, [[brachiopod]]s, etc.)\n       |label2=[[Ecdysozoa]]\n       |2={{clade\n            |1=[[Nematoida]] ([[nematode]]s and close relatives)\n            |2=[[Scalidophora]] ([[priapulid]]s and [[Kinorhyncha]], and [[Loricifera]])\n            |label3=[[Panarthropoda]]\n            |3={{clade\n                 |1=[[Onychophora]]ns\n                 |label2=[[Tactopoda]]\n                 |2={{clade\n                     |1=[[Tardigrade]]s\n                 |label2=Euarthropoda\n                 |2={{clade\n                      |1=[[Chelicerate]]s\n                      |label2=[[Mandibulata]]\n                      |2={{clade\n                           |1=\u2020[[Euthycarcinoid]]s\n                           |2={{clade\n                                |1=[[Myriapod]]s\n                                |label2=[[Pancrustacea]]\n                                |2={{clade\n                                     |1=[[Crustacean]]s\n                                     |2=[[Hexapoda|Hexapods]]\n                                    }}\n                              }}\n                         }}\n                    }}\n               }}\n          }}\n     }}\n}}\n}}\n}}\n</div>Relationships of Ecdysozoa to each other and to annelids, etc.,<ref name=\"TelfordBourlatEtAl2008EvolutionOfEcdysozoa\" /> including euthycarcinoids<ref name=\"Vaccari2004\">{{citation |author1=Vaccari, N.

There had been competing proposals that arthropods were closely related to other groups such as [[nematode]]s, [[priapulid]]s and [[tardigrade]]s, but these remained minority views because it was difficult to specify in detail the relationships between these groups.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic]] analyses of [[DNA]] sequences produced a coherent scheme showing arthropods as members of a [[superphylum]] labelled Ecdysozoa (\"animals that moult\"), which contained nematodes, priapulids and tardigrades but excluded annelids. This was backed up by studies of the anatomy and development of these animals, which showed that many of the features that supported the Articulata hypothesis showed significant differences between annelids and the earliest Panarthropods in their details, and some were hardly present at all in arthropods. This hypothesis groups annelids with molluscs and [[brachiopod]]s in another superphylum, [[Lophotrochozoa]].\n\nIf the Ecdysozoa hypothesis is correct, then segmentation of arthropods and annelids either has evolved [[Convergent evolution|convergently]] or has been inherited from a much older ancestor and subsequently lost in several other lineages, such as the non-arthropod members of the Ecdysozoa.<ref>{{citation |author1=Schmidt-Rhaesa, A. |author2=Bartolomaeus, T. |author3=Lemburg, C. |author4=Ehlers, U. |author5=Garey, J.

It was founded in 1993 and currently there are over 220 students. It is known for its high level of learning and for being one of the most serious hesder yeshivas in Israel. \n==History==\nIn the early 1970s, a group of [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionists]] settled in Yeruham with the goal of imporving the south of Israel, and helping to increase the quality of life for the residents of Yerucham.  Over time, the group grew in number and expanded its activities by taking on educational responsibilities as well. After establishing \"Midreshet B'Yahad\", a Seminar Center of Judaism, Society and Zionism Studies, the group realized the need for a [[yeshiva]] as the next step in strengthening the existing projects by bringing youth to Yeruham.\n\nThe leader of this group, Shmuel Friedman Ben-Shalom, approached [[Eliyahu Blumenzweig|Rabbi Eliyhau Blumenzweig]], who at the time taught at [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], with a proposition to be the Rosh Yeshiva, which he accepted. The yeshiva subsequently opened its doors in 1993<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/index.php?lang=he|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.  \n\nToday, the yeshiva is considered to be one of the most serious hesder yeshivas in the country.\n<br />\n==Curriculum==\nYeshivat HaHesder Yerucham emphasizes the importance of learning [[Talmud]] in depth, specifically through applying the [[Brisker method|Brisker Method]]. A typical day in Yeshiva will include two sessions of intensive Talmud study (''iyun'') and one of extensive study (''bekiut''). \n\nShachris at the Yeshiva is at 6:30am, followed by halachah seder until 8:00am. Breakfast is from 8:00am-8:30am. After breakfast is morning seder, which is typically gemara iyun, and it goes from 8:30am-1:00pm. Following morning seder is lunch and a break from 1:00pm-3pm. Mincha is at 3:00pm, followed by afternoon seder, from about 3:20pm-7:30pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah. Many of the students use the entire afternoon seder for learning machshava, tanach, mussar, and emmunah. From 7:30pm-8:00pm is Maariv, followed by supper from 8:00pm-8:30pm. Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.\n\n\n\n'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\n\n\nThe yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rabbi A.Y.

The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to Rabbi Blumenzweig, rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva include Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.
