[[Hudson's Bay Company]] explorers and traders from [[Mackenzie River]] trading posts used two different routes to enter Yukon and created trading posts along the way. The northern route started in [[Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories]] along the [[Mackenzie River]], crossed the mountains into the [[Bell River (Yukon)|Bell]] and [[Porcupine River]]s to the [[Yukon River]]. The southern route started at [[Fort Liard, Northwest Territories]], then westward along the [[Liard River]] to [[Frances Lake]] and then along the [[Pelly River]] to its juncture with Yukon River.\n\nAfter establishing [[Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories]], [[John Bell (explorer)|John Bell]] crossed the mountains into Yukon River watershed in 1845, and went down the Rat River (today the Bell River) to its confluence with the [[Porcupine River]]. After managing the fur trade at Fort McPherson, he returned to the Bell River, and followed the Porcupine to its juncture with Yukon River, the eventual site of [[Fort Yukon]]. Soon after, [[Alexander Hunter Murray]] established trading posts at [[Lapierre House, Yukon|Lapierre House]] (1846) and at [[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]] (1847) at the juncture of the Porcupine and Yukon Rivers. Murray drew numerous sketches of fur trade posts and of people and wrote the ''Journal of Yukon, 1847\u201348'', which give valuable insight into the culture of local [[Gwich\u2019in]] First Nation people at the time.\n\nWhile the post was actually in [[Russian Alaska]], the Hudson's Bay Company continued to trade there until expelled by the American traders in 1869, following the [[Alaska Purchase]]. A new trading post, [[Rampart House]] was established upstream along the Porcupine, but it also proved to be just inside Alaska's boundary. Gwich\u2019in people, especially under the leadership of [[Sahneuti]], played off the Hudson's Bay Company against American traders from the [[Alaska Commercial Company]].\n\nAt about the same time, [[Robert Campbell (fur trader)|Robert Campbell]], coming from [[Fort Simpson]] explored a large part of the southern Yukon and established [[Fort Frances, Yukon|Fort Frances]] (1842) on [[Frances Lake]] in the [[Liard River]] basin and [[Fort Selkirk, Yukon]] (1848) at the juncture of the [[Yukon River]] and the [[Pelly River]]. In 1852, Fort Selkirk was sacked by [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] warriors from the coast who objected to its interference with their trade. Fort Selkirk was abandoned and not reestablished until 1889.\n\n[[Anglican]] and [[Roman Catholic]] [[missionaries]] followed in the wake of the fur trade. Of note is [[William Carpenter Bompas]] who became the first Anglican [[bishop]] of the Yukon. Catholic missionaries were mainly from the order of [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate]], who still retain a presence in the Yukon today.\n\nIn 1859, [[Robert Kennicott]] set off on an expedition to collect natural history specimens in what is now the [[Mackenzie River]] and Yukon River valleys and in the [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] beyond. Kenicott became popular with Hudson's Bay Company fur traders in the area and encouraged them to collect and send natural history specimens and First Nations artifacts to the Smithsonian. In 1865 the [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] was mounted to find a possible route for a telegraph line between [[North America]] and [[Russia]] by way of the [[Bering Sea]]. Kennicott was the chief scientist for this expedition and the party of naturalists sent to assist him included [[W.H. Dall]]. Kennicott died of a heart attack while travelling up the Yukon River. However, Kennicott's efforts brought what is now the Yukon to the world's attention.\n\nRumours of the presence of gold in the area had been reported by Hudson's Bay Company traders, but little had been done about them. Following the Alaska purchase and the abandonment of Rampart house, Alaska Commercial Company traders started working along the upper Yukon River. Three miners &mdash; [[Alfred Mayo]], [[Jack McQuesten]] and [[Arthur Harper (trader)|Arthur Harper]] &mdash; having heard of these rumours, went to work for the Alaska Commercial Company as traders, although their main interest was in the gold prospects. In 1874, Mayo and McQuesten established [[Fort Reliance]], a few miles downstream of what later became [[Dawson City]]. Miners and prospectors slowly trickled in, and gold was found in many areas but rarely in paying quantities.\n\nIn 1885, a paying amount of gold was found on the [[Stewart River (Yukon)|Stewart River]], and McQuesten convinced the Alaska Commercial Company to start catering to miners rather than focusing only on the fur trade. The following year, paying quantities of coarse gold were found on the [[Fortymile River]], and a new trading post, [[Forty Mile, Yukon]] was established at the confluence of the Fortymile with the Yukon River.\n[[Image:Forty Mile Yukon.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Forty Mile Historic Site from the Yukon River.]]\n\nAt the same time as the initial gold discoveries were being made, the [[US Army]] sent lieutenant [[Frederick Schwatka]] to reconnoiter the Yukon River. Going over the [[Chilkoot Pass]], his party built rafts and floated down the Yukon River to its mouth in the Bering Sea, naming many geographic features along the way. Schwatka's expedition alarmed the Canadian government, who then sent an expedition under [[George Mercer Dawson]] in 1887. [[William Ogilvie (surveyor)|William Ogilvie]], a surveyor who was later to become famous during the Klondike gold Rush and was part of Dawson's expedition, surveyed the boundary with Alaska.\n\nIn 1894, concerned about the influx of American miners and the [[liquor]] trade, the Canadian government sent inspector [[Charles Constantine]] of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] to examine conditions in the [[Yukon districts]].\n\n==Klondike Gold Rush==\n[[Image:Klondike mining camp.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Gold mining on [[Bonanza Creek]].]]\n{{Main|Klondike Gold Rush}}\nThe [[Klondike Gold Rush]] was the seminal event in the Yukon's history. A party led by [[Skookum Jim Mason]] discovered [[gold]] in [[Bonanza Creek]], a tributary of the [[Klondike River]], in August 1896. An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 people braved numerous hardships to reach the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] gold fields in the winter and spring of 1897-1898 after the discovery became known in 1897. With the influx of American stampeders, the Canadian government decided to create a separate territory to better control the situation.\n\nIn 1901, after many had gone back, the [[Census in Canada|Census]] put the population of the territory at 27,219, a figure that was not reached again until 1991. The influx of people greatly stimulated mineral exploration in other parts of the Yukon and led to two subsidiary gold rushes in [[Atlin, British Columbia]] and [[Nome, Alaska]] as well as a number of mini-rushes. Transportation needs to the gold fields led to the construction of the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]].\n\n==Twentieth century==\n[[File:Stadtmuseum Dawson.JPG|thumb| Old Territorial Admistration Building, [[Dawson City]]]]\nAround the start of the 20th century the [[U.S. Army]] began the construction of a telegraph line which ran through [[Tanacross, Alaska|Tanacross]], crossing the [[Tanana River]] at a place called Tanana Crossing. The line continued northward, past the village of Ketchumstuck, and the forked, one branch going west to [[Fairbanks]] and the other to the military post at [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]]. The direct impact of the line was brief, however, since by 1915 the greater part was abandoned and by 1926 only 11 miles remained. In 1912 the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Protestant Episcopal Church]] purchased the telegraph installation at Tanana Crossing and established St. Timothy's mission.\n\nAfter the gold rush, the population of the territory declined precipitously, reaching a low of 4,157 in 1921 and remained fairly steady until the 1940s. This was despite the development of other mining areas including silver in [[List of communities in Yukon#Ghost towns and First Nations communities|Conrad]], [[Yukon]] and especially near [[Mayo, Yukon|Mayo]], gold in the [[Kluane Lake]] area, and copper near [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]]. In the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]], individual miners' claims were bought out and consolidated with the help of the government by a small number of companies, including the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim|Guggenheim]]'s Yukon Gold Corporation who used large floating [[dredge]]s. The Yukon Consolidated Gold Company continued to dredge for gold until the 1960s. A brief period of prosperity ensued during the 1930s when the price of gold rose.\n\nBy 1920, the elected territorial council had been reduced to three members and the territory was directly ruled by the [[Commissioners of Yukon|Gold commissioner]], a federal civil servant reporting to the [[Minister of the Interior (Canada)|Minister of the Interior]].\n\n[[Image:Discovery Claim at Bonanza Creek (1).JPG|thumb|right|Bonanza Creek]]\nThe next important event in Yukon's history was the construction of the [[Alaska Highway]] during the [[Second World War]], which, after its badly needed reconstruction by the Canadian Government in the late 1940s, opened up the territory to road traffic. The [[Alaska Highway]] has played an extremely important role in the acculturation of the people. Today, the highway remains a scenic and well-maintained route throughout the year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://travelyukon.com/About/History |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231529/http://travelyukon.com/About/History |archive-date=2013-10-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The war also saw the construction of a number of airfields as part of the [[Northwest Staging Route]]. However, the influx of southern highway construction crews had a devastating effect on some [[First Nations]], who suffered from a large number of deaths from diseases to which they had no immunity.\n\nOther [[List of Yukon territorial highways|highways]] were built during the 1950s and 1960s, resulting the decline and disappearance of the [[riverboat]]s that had provided the main means of transportation until the 1960s. In the 1950s, the [[White Pass & Yukon Route]] pioneered the use of [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] [[Containerization|containerized]] shipping. Mining activity also revived, including copper mining in Whitehorse, silver and lead in [[Keno City, Yukon|Keno]] and [[Elsa, Yukon|Elsa]], asbestos in [[Clinton Creek, Yukon|Clinton Creek]]. The world's largest [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]] zinc and lead mine was opened in [[Faro, Yukon|Faro]] in the early 1970s. Gold mining came back to the Klondike and other areas with the large rise in gold prices in the late 1970s.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, mining declined and the role of government increased considerably with larger and larger transfers from the federal government. In 1978, party politics was introduced to the Yukon Legislative Assembly. In October 1979, [[responsible government]] was granted by Minister [[Jake Epp]]. On another front, [[First Nations]] started lobbying and entered in [[Yukon Land Claims|land claims negotiations]] in the 1970s which culminated in the signing of an \"Umbrella Final Agreement\" in 1992. Although most First Nations have signed agreements, land claims and self-government negotiations are still going on today. The First Nations are now considered a fourth level of government and the specific nature of inter-governmental relationships is still being worked out. Today, the Canadian government is investing in clean energy research and environmental protection in the territory, with one of the goals being the increased involvement of the First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples in the northern economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1228917/government-of-canada-invests-in-alternative-energy-research-in-yukon|title=Government of Canada Invests in Alternative Energy Research in Yukon|author=|date=|website=www.newswire.ca|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\nWhitcomb, Dr. Ed.

The Yukon was part of the long disappeared [[Beringia]] and hosted a wide variety of megafaunal species like [[steppe wisent]]s, [[American lion]]s, [[short-faced bear]]s, [[woolly mammoth]]s, [[Castoroides|giant beavers]], [[American mastodon]]s, [[stag-moose]], [[ground sloth]]s, ''[[Camelops]]'', [[Dire wolf|dire wolves]], [[caribou]], [[muskox]]en, [[saiga]], [[American cheetah]]s, [[bison]],  [[grizzly bear]]s, ''[[Equus scotti]]'', ''[[Equus lambei]]'', [[Gray wolf|gray wolves]] and [[yak]]s.\n\n==Yukon first nations==\n[[File:Tlingit women and children.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Tlingit]] women and children.]]\n{{main|Indigenous peoples of Yukon}}\n\nEstimates of population of Yukon at the beginning of the 19th century strongly differ.

And in the south, down the [[Teslin River]] there lived continental [[Tlingit]] (Teslin) whose [[Tlingit language|language]] together with [[Athabaskan languages]] is included into [[Na-Dene languages|Na-Dene]] language family.<ref name=\"Wurm, Stephen A. 1996\"/>\n\nCovered with snow [[Mount Saint Elias]] in the extreme southwest of Yukon was unsettled.\n\n==Nineteenth century==\nEuropean incursions into what later became the Yukon started in the first half of the 19th century with the fur trade. [[Hudson's Bay Company]] explorers and traders from [[Mackenzie River]] trading posts used two different routes to enter Yukon and created trading posts along the way. The northern route started in [[Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories]] along the [[Mackenzie River]], crossed the mountains into the [[Bell River (Yukon)|Bell]] and [[Porcupine River]]s to the [[Yukon River]]. The southern route started at [[Fort Liard, Northwest Territories]], then westward along the [[Liard River]] to [[Frances Lake]] and then along the [[Pelly River]] to its juncture with Yukon River.\n\nAfter establishing [[Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories]], [[John Bell (explorer)|John Bell]] crossed the mountains into Yukon River watershed in 1845, and went down the Rat River (today the Bell River) to its confluence with the [[Porcupine River]]. After managing the fur trade at Fort McPherson, he returned to the Bell River, and followed the Porcupine to its juncture with Yukon River, the eventual site of [[Fort Yukon]]. Soon after, [[Alexander Hunter Murray]] established trading posts at [[Lapierre House, Yukon|Lapierre House]] (1846) and at [[Fort Yukon, Alaska|Fort Yukon]] (1847) at the juncture of the Porcupine and Yukon Rivers. Murray drew numerous sketches of fur trade posts and of people and wrote the ''Journal of Yukon, 1847\u201348'', which give valuable insight into the culture of local [[Gwich\u2019in]] First Nation people at the time.\n\nWhile the post was actually in [[Russian Alaska]], the Hudson's Bay Company continued to trade there until expelled by the American traders in 1869, following the [[Alaska Purchase]]. A new trading post, [[Rampart House]] was established upstream along the Porcupine, but it also proved to be just inside Alaska's boundary. Gwich\u2019in people, especially under the leadership of [[Sahneuti]], played off the Hudson's Bay Company against American traders from the [[Alaska Commercial Company]].\n\nAt about the same time, [[Robert Campbell (fur trader)|Robert Campbell]], coming from [[Fort Simpson]] explored a large part of the southern Yukon and established [[Fort Frances, Yukon|Fort Frances]] (1842) on [[Frances Lake]] in the [[Liard River]] basin and [[Fort Selkirk, Yukon]] (1848) at the juncture of the [[Yukon River]] and the [[Pelly River]]. In 1852, Fort Selkirk was sacked by [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] warriors from the coast who objected to its interference with their trade. Fort Selkirk was abandoned and not reestablished until 1889.\n\n[[Anglican]] and [[Roman Catholic]] [[missionaries]] followed in the wake of the fur trade. Of note is [[William Carpenter Bompas]] who became the first Anglican [[bishop]] of the Yukon. Catholic missionaries were mainly from the order of [[Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate]], who still retain a presence in the Yukon today.\n\nIn 1859, [[Robert Kennicott]] set off on an expedition to collect natural history specimens in what is now the [[Mackenzie River]] and Yukon River valleys and in the [[Arctic]] [[tundra]] beyond. Kenicott became popular with Hudson's Bay Company fur traders in the area and encouraged them to collect and send natural history specimens and First Nations artifacts to the Smithsonian. In 1865 the [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] was mounted to find a possible route for a telegraph line between [[North America]] and [[Russia]] by way of the [[Bering Sea]]. Kennicott was the chief scientist for this expedition and the party of naturalists sent to assist him included [[W.H. Dall]]. Kennicott died of a heart attack while travelling up the Yukon River. However, Kennicott's efforts brought what is now the Yukon to the world's attention.\n\nRumours of the presence of gold in the area had been reported by Hudson's Bay Company traders, but little had been done about them. Following the Alaska purchase and the abandonment of Rampart house, Alaska Commercial Company traders started working along the upper Yukon River. Three miners &mdash; [[Alfred Mayo]], [[Jack McQuesten]] and [[Arthur Harper (trader)|Arthur Harper]] &mdash; having heard of these rumours, went to work for the Alaska Commercial Company as traders, although their main interest was in the gold prospects. In 1874, Mayo and McQuesten established [[Fort Reliance]], a few miles downstream of what later became [[Dawson City]]. Miners and prospectors slowly trickled in, and gold was found in many areas but rarely in paying quantities.\n\nIn 1885, a paying amount of gold was found on the [[Stewart River (Yukon)|Stewart River]], and McQuesten convinced the Alaska Commercial Company to start catering to miners rather than focusing only on the fur trade. The following year, paying quantities of coarse gold were found on the [[Fortymile River]], and a new trading post, [[Forty Mile, Yukon]] was established at the confluence of the Fortymile with the Yukon River.\n[[Image:Forty Mile Yukon.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Forty Mile Historic Site from the Yukon River.]]\n\nAt the same time as the initial gold discoveries were being made, the [[US Army]] sent lieutenant [[Frederick Schwatka]] to reconnoiter the Yukon River. Going over the [[Chilkoot Pass]], his party built rafts and floated down the Yukon River to its mouth in the Bering Sea, naming many geographic features along the way. Schwatka's expedition alarmed the Canadian government, who then sent an expedition under [[George Mercer Dawson]] in 1887. [[William Ogilvie (surveyor)|William Ogilvie]], a surveyor who was later to become famous during the Klondike gold Rush and was part of Dawson's expedition, surveyed the boundary with Alaska.\n\nIn 1894, concerned about the influx of American miners and the [[liquor]] trade, the Canadian government sent inspector [[Charles Constantine]] of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] to examine conditions in the [[Yukon districts]].\n\n==Klondike Gold Rush==\n[[Image:Klondike mining camp.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Gold mining on [[Bonanza Creek]].]]\n{{Main|Klondike Gold Rush}}\nThe [[Klondike Gold Rush]] was the seminal event in the Yukon's history. A party led by [[Skookum Jim Mason]] discovered [[gold]] in [[Bonanza Creek]], a tributary of the [[Klondike River]], in August 1896. An estimated 30,000 to 40,000 people braved numerous hardships to reach the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] gold fields in the winter and spring of 1897-1898 after the discovery became known in 1897. With the influx of American stampeders, the Canadian government decided to create a separate territory to better control the situation.\n\nIn 1901, after many had gone back, the [[Census in Canada|Census]] put the population of the territory at 27,219, a figure that was not reached again until 1991. The influx of people greatly stimulated mineral exploration in other parts of the Yukon and led to two subsidiary gold rushes in [[Atlin, British Columbia]] and [[Nome, Alaska]] as well as a number of mini-rushes. Transportation needs to the gold fields led to the construction of the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]].\n\n==Twentieth century==\n[[File:Stadtmuseum Dawson.JPG|thumb| Old Territorial Admistration Building, [[Dawson City]]]]\nAround the start of the 20th century the [[U.S. Army]] began the construction of a telegraph line which ran through [[Tanacross, Alaska|Tanacross]], crossing the [[Tanana River]] at a place called Tanana Crossing. The line continued northward, past the village of Ketchumstuck, and the forked, one branch going west to [[Fairbanks]] and the other to the military post at [[Eagle, Alaska|Eagle]]. The direct impact of the line was brief, however, since by 1915 the greater part was abandoned and by 1926 only 11 miles remained. In 1912 the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Protestant Episcopal Church]] purchased the telegraph installation at Tanana Crossing and established St. Timothy's mission.\n\nAfter the gold rush, the population of the territory declined precipitously, reaching a low of 4,157 in 1921 and remained fairly steady until the 1940s. This was despite the development of other mining areas including silver in [[List of communities in Yukon#Ghost towns and First Nations communities|Conrad]], [[Yukon]] and especially near [[Mayo, Yukon|Mayo]], gold in the [[Kluane Lake]] area, and copper near [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]]. In the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]], individual miners' claims were bought out and consolidated with the help of the government by a small number of companies, including the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim|Guggenheim]]'s Yukon Gold Corporation who used large floating [[dredge]]s. The Yukon Consolidated Gold Company continued to dredge for gold until the 1960s. A brief period of prosperity ensued during the 1930s when the price of gold rose.\n\nBy 1920, the elected territorial council had been reduced to three members and the territory was directly ruled by the [[Commissioners of Yukon|Gold commissioner]], a federal civil servant reporting to the [[Minister of the Interior (Canada)|Minister of the Interior]].\n\n[[Image:Discovery Claim at Bonanza Creek (1).JPG|thumb|right|Bonanza Creek]]\nThe next important event in Yukon's history was the construction of the [[Alaska Highway]] during the [[Second World War]], which, after its badly needed reconstruction by the Canadian Government in the late 1940s, opened up the territory to road traffic. The [[Alaska Highway]] has played an extremely important role in the acculturation of the people. Today, the highway remains a scenic and well-maintained route throughout the year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://travelyukon.com/About/History |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231529/http://travelyukon.com/About/History |archive-date=2013-10-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The war also saw the construction of a number of airfields as part of the [[Northwest Staging Route]]. However, the influx of southern highway construction crews had a devastating effect on some [[First Nations]], who suffered from a large number of deaths from diseases to which they had no immunity.\n\nOther [[List of Yukon territorial highways|highways]] were built during the 1950s and 1960s, resulting the decline and disappearance of the [[riverboat]]s that had provided the main means of transportation until the 1960s. In the 1950s, the [[White Pass & Yukon Route]] pioneered the use of [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal]] [[Containerization|containerized]] shipping. Mining activity also revived, including copper mining in Whitehorse, silver and lead in [[Keno City, Yukon|Keno]] and [[Elsa, Yukon|Elsa]], asbestos in [[Clinton Creek, Yukon|Clinton Creek]]. The world's largest [[Open-pit mining|open-pit]] zinc and lead mine was opened in [[Faro, Yukon|Faro]] in the early 1970s. Gold mining came back to the Klondike and other areas with the large rise in gold prices in the late 1970s.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, mining declined and the role of government increased considerably with larger and larger transfers from the federal government. In 1978, party politics was introduced to the Yukon Legislative Assembly. In October 1979, [[responsible government]] was granted by Minister [[Jake Epp]]. On another front, [[First Nations]] started lobbying and entered in [[Yukon Land Claims|land claims negotiations]] in the 1970s which culminated in the signing of an \"Umbrella Final Agreement\" in 1992. Although most First Nations have signed agreements, land claims and self-government negotiations are still going on today. The First Nations are now considered a fourth level of government and the specific nature of inter-governmental relationships is still being worked out. Today, the Canadian government is investing in clean energy research and environmental protection in the territory, with one of the goals being the increased involvement of the First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples in the northern economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1228917/government-of-canada-invests-in-alternative-energy-research-in-yukon|title=Government of Canada Invests in Alternative Energy Research in Yukon|author=|date=|website=www.newswire.ca|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\nWhitcomb, Dr. Ed.

In his book ''The Political Theatre'', Piscator wrote: \"Perhaps my whole style of directing is a direct result of the total lack of suitable plays. It would certainly not have taken so dominant form if adequate plays had been on hand when I started\" (1929, 185).</ref> Brecht collaborated with Piscator during the period of the latter's landmark productions, ''[[Hoppla, We're Alive!]]'' by [[Ernst Toller|Toller]], ''Rasputin'', ''[[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk|The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik]]'', and ''Konjunktur'' by [[L\u00e9o Lania|Lania]].<ref>Willett (1978, 74).</ref> Brecht's most significant contribution was to the adaptation of the unfinished episodic comic novel ''Schweik'', which he later described as a \"montage from the novel\".<ref>See Brecht's ''Journal'' entry for 24 June 1943. Brecht claimed to have written the adaptation (in his ''Journal'' entry), but Piscator contested that; the manuscript bears the names \"Brecht, [Felix] Gasbarra, [[Erwin Piscator|Piscator]], [[George Grosz|G. Grosz]]\" in Brecht's handwriting (Willett 1978, 110). See also Willett (1978, 90\u201395). Brecht wrote a sequel to the novel in 1943, ''[[Schweik in the Second World War]]''.</ref> The Piscator productions influenced Brecht's ideas about staging and design, and alerted him to the radical potentials offered to the \"[[Non-Aristotelian drama|epic]]\" playwright by the development of stage technology (particularly projections).<ref>Willett (1998, 104). In relation to his innovations in the use of theatre technology, Piscator wrote: \"technical innovations were never an end in themselves for me. Any means I have used or am currently in the process of using were designed to elevate the events on the stage onto a [[Historicization|historical plane]] and not just to enlarge the technical range of the stage machinery. My technical devices had been developed to cover up the deficiencies of the dramatists' products\" (\"Basic Principles of a Sociological Drama\" [1929]; in Kolocotroni, Goldman and Taxidou [1998, 243]).</ref> What Brecht took from Piscator \"is fairly plain, and he acknowledged it\" Willett suggests:\n<blockquote>The emphasis on Reason and didacticism, the sense that the new subject matter demanded a [[Non-Aristotelian drama|new dramatic form]], the use of songs to [[Interruptions (epic theatre)|interrupt]] and comment: all these are found in his notes and essays of the 1920s, and he bolstered them by citing such Piscatorial examples as the step-by-step narrative technique of ''Schweik'' and the oil interests handled in ''Konjunktur'' ('Petroleum resists the five-act form').<ref>Willett (1978, 109\u2013110). The similarities between Brecht's and Piscator's theoretical formulations from the time indicate that the two agreed on fundamentals; compare Piscator's summation of the achievements of his first company (1929), which follows, with Brecht's [[The Modern Theatre Is the Epic Theatre|''Mahagonny'' Notes]] (1930): \"In lieu of private themes we had generalisation, in lieu of what was special the typical, in lieu of accident causality. Decorativeness gave way to constructedness, Reason was put on a par with Emotion, while sensuality was replaced by didacticism and fantasy by documentary reality.\" From a speech given by Piscator on 25 March 1929, and reproduced in ''Schriften 2'' p.&nbsp;50; Quoted by Willett (1978, 107). See also Willett (1998, 104\u2013105).</ref></blockquote>\nBrecht was struggling at the time with the question of how to dramatize the complex economic relationships of modern capitalism in his unfinished project ''Joe P. Fleischhacker'' (which Piscator's theatre announced in its programme for the 1927\u201328 season). It wasn't until his ''[[Saint Joan of the Stockyards]]'' (written between 1929\u20131931) that Brecht solved it.<ref>Willett (1998, 104\u2013105).</ref> In 1928 he discussed with Piscator plans to stage [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and Brecht's own ''[[Drums in the Night]]'', but the productions did not materialize.<ref>Willett (1978, 76).</ref>\n\n1927 also saw the first collaboration between Brecht and the young composer [[Kurt Weill]].<ref>The two first met in March 1927, after Weill had written a critical introduction to the broadcast on Berlin Radio of an adaptation of Brecht's ''[[Man Equals Man]]''. When they met, Brecht was 29 years old and Weill was 27. Brecht had experience of writing songs and had performed his own with tunes he had composed; at the time he was also married to an opera singer (Zoff). Weill had collaborated with [[Georg Kaiser]], one of the few [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] playwrights that Brecht admired; he was married to the actress [[Lotte Lenya]]. Willett and Manheim (1979, xv).</ref> Together they began to develop Brecht's ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny|Mahagonny]]'' project, along thematic lines of the biblical [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Cities of the Plain]] but rendered in terms of the ''[[New Objectivity|Neue Sachlichkeit]]'''s ''Amerikanismus'', which had informed Brecht's previous work.<ref>Willet and Manheim (1979, xv\u2013xviii). In Munich in 1924 Brecht had begun referring to some of the stranger aspects of life in post-[[Beer Hall Putsch|putsch]] Bavaria under the codename \"Mahagonny\". The ''Amerikanismus'' imagery appears in his first three \"Mahagonny Songs\", with their Wild West references. With that, however, the project stalled for two and a half years. With Hauptmann, who wrote the two English-language \"Mahagonny Songs\", Brecht had begun work on an opera to be called ''Sodom and Gomorrah'' or ''The Man from Manhattan'' and a radio play called ''The Flood'' or 'The Collapse of Miami, the Paradise City', both of which came to underlie the new scheme with Weill. See Willett and Manheim (1979, xv\u2013xvi). The influence of ''Amerikanismus'' is most clearly discernible in Brecht's ''[[In the Jungle of Cities]]''.</ref> They produced ''[[Mahagonny-Songspiel|The Little Mahagonny]]'' for a music festival in July, as what Weill called a \"stylistic exercise\" in preparation for the large-scale piece. From that point on [[Caspar Neher]] became an integral part of the collaborative effort, with words, music and visuals conceived in relation to one another from the start.<ref>In this respect, the creative process for ''[[Mahagonny]]'' was quite different from ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', with the former being ''durchkomponiert'' or set to music right through, whereas on the latter Weill was brought at a late stage to set the songs. See Willett and Manheim (1979, xv).</ref> The model for their mutual articulation lay in Brecht's newly formulated principle of the \"[[separation of the elements]]\", which he first outlined in \"[[The Modern Theatre Is the Epic Theatre]]\" (1930). The principle, a variety of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]], proposed by-passing the \"great struggle for supremacy between words, music and production\" as Brecht put it, by showing each as self-contained, independent works of art that [[Gestus|adopt attitudes]] towards one another.<ref>Willett and Manheim (1979, xvii) and {{harvnb|Brecht|1964|pp=37\u201338}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1988, MiNr Block 091.jpg|thumb|Stamp from the former [[East Germany]] depicting Brecht and a scene from his ''[[Life of Galileo]]'']]\n\nIn 1930 Brecht married Weigel; their daughter Barbara Brecht was born soon after the wedding.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/642308/Barbara-Brecht-Schall|title=Barbara Brecht-Schall&nbsp;\u2013 About This Person|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> She also became an actress and would later share the [[copyright]]s of Brecht's work with her siblings.\n\nBrecht formed a writing collective which became prolific and very influential. [[Elisabeth Hauptmann]], Margarete Steffin, Emil Burri, [[Ruth Berlau]] and others worked with Brecht and produced the multiple [[Lehrst\u00fccke|teaching plays]], which attempted to create a new [[dramaturgy]] for participants rather than passive audiences. These addressed themselves to the massive worker arts organisation that existed in Germany and Austria in the 1920s. So did Brecht's first great play, ''[[Saint Joan of the Stockyards]]'', which attempts to portray the drama in financial transactions.\n\nThis collective adapted [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', with Brecht's lyrics set to music by [[Kurt Weill]]. Retitled ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' (''Die Dreigroschenoper'') it was the biggest hit in Berlin of the 1920s and a renewing influence on the musical worldwide. One of its most famous lines underscored the hypocrisy of conventional morality imposed by the Church, working in conjunction with the established order, in the face of working-class hunger and deprivation:\n\n{|\n|<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">''Erst kommt das Fressen''\n''Dann kommt die Moral.''</poem>\n|<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">First the grub (lit. \"eating like animals, gorging\")\nThen the morality.</poem>\n|}\n\nThe success of ''The Threepenny Opera'' was followed by the quickly thrown together ''Happy End''. It was a personal and a commercial failure. At the time the book was purported to be by the mysterious Dorothy Lane (now known to be Elisabeth Hauptmann, Brecht's secretary and close collaborator). Brecht only claimed authorship of the song texts. Brecht would later use elements of ''Happy End'' as the germ for his ''Saint Joan of the Stockyards'', a play that would never see the stage in Brecht's lifetime. ''Happy End'''s score by Weill produced many Brecht/Weill hits like \"Der Bilbao-Song\" and \"Surabaya-Jonny\".\n\nThe masterpiece of the Brecht/Weill collaborations, ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny]]'' (''Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny''), caused an uproar when it premiered in 1930 in Leipzig, with Nazis in the audience protesting. The ''Mahagonny'' opera would premier later in Berlin in 1931 as a triumphant sensation.\n\nBrecht spent the last years of the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar-era]] (1930\u20131933) in Berlin working with his \"collective\" on the ''Lehrst\u00fccke''. These were a group of plays driven by morals, music and Brecht's budding epic theatre. The ''Lehrst\u00fccke'' often aimed at educating workers on Socialist issues. ''[[The Decision (play)|The Measures Taken]]'' (''Die Massnahme'') was scored by [[Hanns Eisler]]. In addition, Brecht worked on a script for a semi-documentary feature film about the human impact of mass unemployment, ''[[Kuhle Wampe]]'' (1932), which was directed by [[Slatan Dudow]]. This striking film is notable for its subversive humour, outstanding [[cinematography]] by [[G\u00fcnther Krampf]], and Hanns Eisler's dynamic musical contribution. It still provides a vivid insight into Berlin during the last years of the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n=== Nazi Germany and World War II (1933\u20131945) ===\n{{Quote box\n|bgcolor = #c6dbf7\n|quote = Unhappy the land where heroes are needed.\n|source = [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], in Brecht's ''[[Life of Galileo]]'' ([[1943 in literature#New drama|1943]])\n|salign = right\n}}\nFearing persecution, Brecht left [[Nazi Germany]] in February 1933, just after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] took power.

Although he was one of 19 witnesses who declared that they would refuse to appear, Brecht eventually decided to testify. He later explained that he had followed the advice of attorneys and had not wanted to delay a planned trip to Europe. On 30 October 1947 Brecht testified that he had never been a member of the [[Communist Party]].<ref name=HUAC2/> He made wry jokes throughout the proceedings, punctuating his inability to speak English well with continuous references to the translators present, who transformed his German statements into English ones unintelligible to himself. HUAC vice-chairman [[Karl E. Mundt|Karl Mundt]] thanked Brecht for his co-operation. The remaining witnesses, the so-called [[Hollywood Ten]], refused to testify and were cited for contempt. Brecht's decision to appear before the committee led to criticism, including accusations of betrayal. The day after his testimony, on 31 October, Brecht returned to Europe.\n\nHe lived in [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]] in Switzerland for a year. In February 1948 in [[Chur]], Brecht staged an adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'', based on a translation by [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin|H\u00f6lderlin]]. It was published under the title ''Antigonemodell 1948'', accompanied by an essay on the importance of creating a \"[[Non-Aristotelian drama|non-Aristotelian]]\" form of theatre.\n\nIn 1949 he moved to [[East Berlin]] and established his theatre company there, the [[Berliner Ensemble]].  He retained his Austrian nationality (granted in 1950) and overseas bank accounts from which he received valuable hard currency remittances.

At this time he wrote some of his most famous poems, including the \"Buckow Elegies\".\n\nAt first Brecht apparently supported the measures taken by the East German government against the [[uprising of 1953 in East Germany]], which included the use of Soviet military force. In a letter from the day of the uprising to [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] First Secretary [[Walter Ulbricht]], Brecht wrote that: \"History will pay its respects to the revolutionary impatience of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The great discussion [exchange] with the masses about the speed of socialist construction will lead to a viewing and safeguarding of the socialist achievements. At this moment I must assure you of my allegiance to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.\"<ref>Letter published in the ''Neues Deutschland'', 21 June 1953.</ref>\n[[File:Brechtgrave.jpg|thumb|Graves of Helene Weigel and Bertolt Brecht in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]]]]\nBrecht's subsequent commentary on those events, however, offered a very different assessment\u2014in one of the poems in the ''Elegies'', \"[[Die L\u00f6sung]]\" (The Solution), a disillusioned Brecht writes a few months later:\n<blockquote><poem>\nAfter the uprising of the 17th of June\nThe Secretary of the Writers Union\nHad leaflets distributed in the [[Stalinallee]]\nStating that the people\nHad forfeited the confidence of the government\nAnd could win it back only\nBy redoubled efforts.\n\nWould it not be easier\nIn that case for the government\nTo dissolve the people\nAnd elect another?<ref>Brecht (2000b, 440). The poem was first printed in the West-German newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' in 1959 and subsequently in the ''Buckow Elegies'' in the West 1964. It was first published in the GDR in 1969 after Helene Weigel had insisted on its inclusion in a collected edition of Brecht's works.</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\n=== Death ===\nBrecht died on 14 August 1956<ref>{{Britannica|78614}}</ref> of a heart attack at the age of 58. He is buried in the Dorotheenst\u00e4dtischer cemetery on Chausseestra\u00dfe in the [[Mitte]] neighbourhood of Berlin, overlooked by the residence he shared with Helene Weigel.\n\nAccording to Stephen Parker, who reviewed Brecht's writings and unpublished medical records, Brecht contracted rheumatic fever as a child, which led to an enlarged heart, followed by lifelong chronic heart failure and [[Sydenham's chorea]]. A report of a radiograph taken of Brecht in 1951 describes a badly diseased heart, enlarged to the left with a protruding [[aortic knob]] and with seriously impaired pumping. Brecht's colleagues described him as being very nervous, and sometimes shaking his head or moving his hands erratically. This can be reasonably attributed to Sydenham's chorea, which is also associated with [[emotional lability]], personality changes, [[obsessive-compulsive]] behavior, and hyperactivity, which matched Brecht's behavior. \"What is remarkable,\" wrote Parker, \"is his capacity to turn abject physical weakness into peerless artistic strength, arrhythmia into the rhythms of poetry, chorea into the choreography of drama.\"<ref name=\"Parker\">{{cite journal | title =Diagnosing Bertolt Brecht.| journal =Lancet| date =2 April 2011| author =Parker S.| volume =377| issue =9772| pages =1146\u20137| url =http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2960453-4/fulltext#| doi =10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60453-4| pmid =21465701| pmc =}}</ref>\n\n== Theory and practice of theatre ==\n[[File:Cremer Brecht.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Brecht outside the Berliner Ensemble's theatre in Berlin]]\nBrecht developed the combined theory and practice of his \"[[Epic theatre]]\" by synthesizing and extending the experiments of [[Erwin Piscator]] and [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] to explore the theatre as a [[Political theatre|forum for political ideas]] and the creation of a critical aesthetics of [[dialectical materialism]].\n\nEpic Theatre proposed that a play should not cause the spectator to identify emotionally with the characters or action before him or her, but should instead provoke rational self-reflection and a critical view of the action on the stage. Brecht thought that the experience of a [[Climax (narrative)|climactic]] [[catharsis]] of emotion left an audience complacent. Instead, he wanted his audiences to adopt a critical perspective in order to recognise social injustice and exploitation and to be moved to go forth from the theatre and effect change in the world outside.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Critical Response to Heidi M.

By highlighting the constructed nature of the theatrical event, Brecht hoped to communicate that the audience's reality was equally constructed and, as such, was changeable.\n\nBrecht's [[Modernism|modernist]] concern with drama-as-a-[[Medium specificity|medium]] led to his refinement of the \"[[Non-Aristotelian drama|epic form]]\" of the drama. This dramatic form is related to similar modernist innovations in other [[The arts|arts]], including the strategy of divergent chapters in [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s evolution of a [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] \"[[Soviet montage theory|montage]]\" in the cinema, and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s introduction of [[Cubism|cubist]] \"collage\" in the visual arts.<ref>On these relationships, see \"autonomization\" in Jameson (1998, 43\u201358) and \"non-organic work of art\" in B\u00fcrger (1984, 87\u201392).  Willett observes: \"With Brecht the same [[Soviet montage theory|montage]] technique spread to the drama, where the old [[Procrustes|Procrustean]] plot yielded to a more \"[[Non-Aristotelian drama|epic]]\" form of narrative better able to cope with wide-ranging modern socio-economic themes. That, at least, was how Brecht theoretically justified his choice of form, and from about 1929 on he began to interpret its penchant for \"[[contradiction]]s\", much as had [[Sergei Eisenstein]], in terms of the [[dialectic]]. It is fairly clear that in Brecht's case the practice came before the theory, for his actual composition of a play, with its switching around of scenes and characters, even the physical cutting up and sticking together of the typescript, shows that montage was the structural technique most natural to him. Like [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]] and Joyce he had not learnt this scissors-and-paste method from the Soviet cinema but picked it out of the air\" (1978, 110).</ref>\n\nOne of Brecht's most important principles was what he called the ''[[Verfremdungseffekt]]'' (translated as \"defamiliarization effect\", \"distancing effect\", or \"estrangement effect\", and often mistranslated as \"alienation effect\").<ref>Brooker (1994, 193). Brooker writes that \"the term 'alienation' is an inadequate and even misleading translation of Brecht's ''Verfremdung''. The terms 'de-familiarisation' or 'estrangement', when understood as more than purely formal devices, give a more accurate sense of Brecht's intentions. A better term still would be 'de-[[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]'\".</ref> This involved, Brecht wrote, \"stripping the event of its self-evident, familiar, obvious quality and creating a sense of astonishment and curiosity about them\".<ref>Brecht, quoted by Brooker (1994, 191).</ref> To this end, Brecht employed techniques such as the actor's direct address to the audience, harsh and bright stage lighting, the use of songs to [[Interruptions (epic theatre)|interrupt]] the action, explanatory placards, the transposition of text to the [[Grammatical person|third person]] or [[past tense]] in rehearsals, and speaking the stage directions out loud.{{sfn|Brecht|1964|p=138}}\n\nIn contrast to many other [[avant-garde]] approaches, however, Brecht had no desire to [[Anti-art|destroy art]] as an institution; rather, he hoped to \"[[Refunctioning|re-function]]\" the theatre to a new social use. In this regard he was a vital participant in the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] debates of his era\u2014particularly over the \"[[High culture|high art]]/popular culture\" dichotomy\u2014vying with the likes of [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]], [[Ernst Bloch]], and developing a close friendship with [[Walter Benjamin]]. Brechtian theatre articulated popular themes and forms with avant-garde formal experimentation to create a modernist realism that stood in sharp contrast both to its [[Realism (theatre)|psychological]] and [[Socialist realism|socialist]] varieties. \"Brecht's work is the most important and original in European drama since [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] and [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]],\" [[Raymond Williams]] argues, while [[Peter B\u00fcrger]] dubs him \"the most important [[Materialism|materialist]] writer of our time.\"<ref>The quotation from Raymond Williams is on page 277 of his book (1993) and that from Peter B\u00fcrger on page 88 of his (1984).</ref>\n\nBrecht was also influenced by Chinese theatre, and used its aesthetic as an argument for ''Verfremdungseffekt''. Brecht believed, \"Traditional Chinese acting also knows the alienation [sic] effect, and applies it most subtly.<ref>\"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic\" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 91</ref>... The [Chinese] performer portrays incidents of utmost passion, but without his delivery becoming heated.\"<ref>\"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic\" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 92</ref> Brecht attended a Chinese opera performance and was introduced to the famous Chinese opera performer [[Mei Lanfang]] in 1935.<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=40246399|title=Bertolt Brecht in China and His Impact on Chinese Drama|first=Adrian|last=Hsia|journal=[[Comparative Literature Studies]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=<!-- [northern] Summer --> 1983|pages=231\u2013245}}</ref> However, Brecht was sure to distinguish between Epic and Chinese theatre. He recognized that the Chinese style was not a \"transportable piece of technique,\"<ref>\"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic\" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 95</ref> and that Epic theatre sought to historicize and address social and political issues.<ref>\"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic\" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 96</ref>\n\nBrecht used his poetry to criticize European culture, including [[Nazis]], and the German [[bourgeoisie]]. Brecht's poetry is marked by the effects of the First and [[Second World War]]s.\n\nThroughout his theatric production, poems are incorporated into this plays with music. In 1951, Brecht issued a recantation of his apparent suppression of poetry in his plays with a note titled ''On Poetry and Virtuosity''. He writes:\n<blockquote>We shall not need to speak of a play's poetry ... something that seemed relatively unimportant in the immediate past. It seemed not only unimportant, but misleading, and the reason was not that the poetic element had been sufficiently developed and observed, but that reality had been tampered with in its name ... we had to speak of a truth as distinct from poetry ... we have given up examining works of art from their poetic or artistic aspect, and got satisfaction from theatrical works that have no sort of poetic appeal ... Such works and performances may have some effect, but it can hardly be a profound one, not even politically. For it is a peculiarity of the theatrical medium that it communicates awarenesses and impulses in the form of pleasure: the depth of the pleasure and the impulse will correspond to the depth of the pleasure.\n</blockquote>\nBrecht's most influential poetry is featured in his ''Manual of Piety (Devotions)'', establishing him as a noted poet.\n\n== Legacy ==\nBrecht's widow, the actress [[Helene Weigel]], continued to manage the Berliner Ensemble until her death in 1971; it was primarily devoted to performing Brecht's plays.\n\nBesides being an influential dramatist and poet, some scholars have stressed the significance of Brecht's original contributions in political and social philosophy.<ref>{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to the Social and Political Philosophy of Bertolt Brecht|last = Squiers|first = Anthony|publisher = Rodopi|year = 2014|isbn = 9789042038998|location = Amsterdam|pages = }}</ref>\n\nBrecht's collaborations with Kurt Weill have had some influence in rock music.

Jameson describes the creator of the work not as Brecht the individual, but rather as 'Brecht': a collective subject that \"certainly seemed to have a distinctive style (the one we now call 'Brechtian') but was no longer personal in the bourgeois or [[Individualism|individualistic]] sense.\" During the course of his career, Brecht sustained many long-lasting creative relationships with other writers, composers, [[scenographer]]s, directors, [[dramaturg]]s and actors; the list includes: [[Elisabeth Hauptmann]], [[Margarete Steffin]], [[Ruth Berlau]], [[Slatan Dudow]], [[Kurt Weill]], [[Hanns Eisler]], [[Paul Dessau]], [[Caspar Neher]], [[Teo Otto]], [[Karl von Appen]], [[Ernst Busch (actor)|Ernst Busch]], [[Lotte Lenya]], [[Peter Lorre]], [[Therese Giehse]], [[Angelika Hurwicz]], [[Carola Neher]] and Helene Weigel herself.

In his book ''The Political Theatre'', Piscator wrote: \"Perhaps my whole style of directing is a direct result of the total lack of suitable plays. It would certainly not have taken so dominant form if adequate plays had been on hand when I started\" (1929, 185).</ref> Brecht collaborated with Piscator during the period of the latter's landmark productions, ''[[Hoppla, We're Alive!]]'' by [[Ernst Toller|Toller]], ''Rasputin'', ''[[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk|The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik]]'', and ''Konjunktur'' by [[L\u00e9o Lania|Lania]].<ref>Willett (1978, 74).</ref> Brecht's most significant contribution was to the adaptation of the unfinished episodic comic novel ''Schweik'', which he later described as a \"montage from the novel\".<ref>See Brecht's ''Journal'' entry for 24 June 1943. Brecht claimed to have written the adaptation (in his ''Journal'' entry), but Piscator contested that; the manuscript bears the names \"Brecht, [Felix] Gasbarra, [[Erwin Piscator|Piscator]], [[George Grosz|G. Grosz]]\" in Brecht's handwriting (Willett 1978, 110). See also Willett (1978, 90\u201395). Brecht wrote a sequel to the novel in 1943, ''[[Schweik in the Second World War]]''.</ref> The Piscator productions influenced Brecht's ideas about staging and design, and alerted him to the radical potentials offered to the \"[[Non-Aristotelian drama|epic]]\" playwright by the development of stage technology (particularly projections).<ref>Willett (1998, 104). In relation to his innovations in the use of theatre technology, Piscator wrote: \"technical innovations were never an end in themselves for me. Any means I have used or am currently in the process of using were designed to elevate the events on the stage onto a [[Historicization|historical plane]] and not just to enlarge the technical range of the stage machinery. My technical devices had been developed to cover up the deficiencies of the dramatists' products\" (\"Basic Principles of a Sociological Drama\" [1929]; in Kolocotroni, Goldman and Taxidou [1998, 243]).</ref> What Brecht took from Piscator \"is fairly plain, and he acknowledged it\" Willett suggests:\n<blockquote>The emphasis on Reason and didacticism, the sense that the new subject matter demanded a [[Non-Aristotelian drama|new dramatic form]], the use of songs to [[Interruptions (epic theatre)|interrupt]] and comment: all these are found in his notes and essays of the 1920s, and he bolstered them by citing such Piscatorial examples as the step-by-step narrative technique of ''Schweik'' and the oil interests handled in ''Konjunktur'' ('Petroleum resists the five-act form').<ref>Willett (1978, 109\u2013110). The similarities between Brecht's and Piscator's theoretical formulations from the time indicate that the two agreed on fundamentals; compare Piscator's summation of the achievements of his first company (1929), which follows, with Brecht's [[The Modern Theatre Is the Epic Theatre|''Mahagonny'' Notes]] (1930): \"In lieu of private themes we had generalisation, in lieu of what was special the typical, in lieu of accident causality. Decorativeness gave way to constructedness, Reason was put on a par with Emotion, while sensuality was replaced by didacticism and fantasy by documentary reality.\" From a speech given by Piscator on 25 March 1929, and reproduced in ''Schriften 2'' p.&nbsp;50; Quoted by Willett (1978, 107). See also Willett (1998, 104\u2013105).</ref></blockquote>\nBrecht was struggling at the time with the question of how to dramatize the complex economic relationships of modern capitalism in his unfinished project ''Joe P. Fleischhacker'' (which Piscator's theatre announced in its programme for the 1927\u201328 season). It wasn't until his ''[[Saint Joan of the Stockyards]]'' (written between 1929\u20131931) that Brecht solved it.<ref>Willett (1998, 104\u2013105).</ref> In 1928 he discussed with Piscator plans to stage [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' and Brecht's own ''[[Drums in the Night]]'', but the productions did not materialize.<ref>Willett (1978, 76).</ref>\n\n1927 also saw the first collaboration between Brecht and the young composer [[Kurt Weill]].<ref>The two first met in March 1927, after Weill had written a critical introduction to the broadcast on Berlin Radio of an adaptation of Brecht's ''[[Man Equals Man]]''. When they met, Brecht was 29 years old and Weill was 27. Brecht had experience of writing songs and had performed his own with tunes he had composed; at the time he was also married to an opera singer (Zoff). Weill had collaborated with [[Georg Kaiser]], one of the few [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] playwrights that Brecht admired; he was married to the actress [[Lotte Lenya]]. Willett and Manheim (1979, xv).</ref> Together they began to develop Brecht's ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny|Mahagonny]]'' project, along thematic lines of the biblical [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Cities of the Plain]] but rendered in terms of the ''[[New Objectivity|Neue Sachlichkeit]]'''s ''Amerikanismus'', which had informed Brecht's previous work.<ref>Willet and Manheim (1979, xv\u2013xviii). In Munich in 1924 Brecht had begun referring to some of the stranger aspects of life in post-[[Beer Hall Putsch|putsch]] Bavaria under the codename \"Mahagonny\". The ''Amerikanismus'' imagery appears in his first three \"Mahagonny Songs\", with their Wild West references. With that, however, the project stalled for two and a half years. With Hauptmann, who wrote the two English-language \"Mahagonny Songs\", Brecht had begun work on an opera to be called ''Sodom and Gomorrah'' or ''The Man from Manhattan'' and a radio play called ''The Flood'' or 'The Collapse of Miami, the Paradise City', both of which came to underlie the new scheme with Weill. See Willett and Manheim (1979, xv\u2013xvi). The influence of ''Amerikanismus'' is most clearly discernible in Brecht's ''[[In the Jungle of Cities]]''.</ref> They produced ''[[Mahagonny-Songspiel|The Little Mahagonny]]'' for a music festival in July, as what Weill called a \"stylistic exercise\" in preparation for the large-scale piece. From that point on [[Caspar Neher]] became an integral part of the collaborative effort, with words, music and visuals conceived in relation to one another from the start.<ref>In this respect, the creative process for ''[[Mahagonny]]'' was quite different from ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', with the former being ''durchkomponiert'' or set to music right through, whereas on the latter Weill was brought at a late stage to set the songs. See Willett and Manheim (1979, xv).</ref> The model for their mutual articulation lay in Brecht's newly formulated principle of the \"[[separation of the elements]]\", which he first outlined in \"[[The Modern Theatre Is the Epic Theatre]]\" (1930). The principle, a variety of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]], proposed by-passing the \"great struggle for supremacy between words, music and production\" as Brecht put it, by showing each as self-contained, independent works of art that [[Gestus|adopt attitudes]] towards one another.<ref>Willett and Manheim (1979, xvii) and {{harvnb|Brecht|1964|pp=37\u201338}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1988, MiNr Block 091.jpg|thumb|Stamp from the former [[East Germany]] depicting Brecht and a scene from his ''[[Life of Galileo]]'']]\n\nIn 1930 Brecht married Weigel; their daughter Barbara Brecht was born soon after the wedding.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/person/642308/Barbara-Brecht-Schall|title=Barbara Brecht-Schall&nbsp;\u2013 About This Person|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> She also became an actress and would later share the [[copyright]]s of Brecht's work with her siblings.\n\nBrecht formed a writing collective which became prolific and very influential. [[Elisabeth Hauptmann]], Margarete Steffin, Emil Burri, [[Ruth Berlau]] and others worked with Brecht and produced the multiple [[Lehrst\u00fccke|teaching plays]], which attempted to create a new [[dramaturgy]] for participants rather than passive audiences. These addressed themselves to the massive worker arts organisation that existed in Germany and Austria in the 1920s. So did Brecht's first great play, ''[[Saint Joan of the Stockyards]]'', which attempts to portray the drama in financial transactions.\n\nThis collective adapted [[John Gay]]'s ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', with Brecht's lyrics set to music by [[Kurt Weill]]. Retitled ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' (''Die Dreigroschenoper'') it was the biggest hit in Berlin of the 1920s and a renewing influence on the musical worldwide. One of its most famous lines underscored the hypocrisy of conventional morality imposed by the Church, working in conjunction with the established order, in the face of working-class hunger and deprivation:\n\n{|\n|<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">''Erst kommt das Fressen''\n''Dann kommt die Moral.''</poem>\n|<poem style=\"margin-left: 2em;\">First the grub (lit. \"eating like animals, gorging\")\nThen the morality.</poem>\n|}\n\nThe success of ''The Threepenny Opera'' was followed by the quickly thrown together ''Happy End''. It was a personal and a commercial failure. At the time the book was purported to be by the mysterious Dorothy Lane (now known to be Elisabeth Hauptmann, Brecht's secretary and close collaborator). Brecht only claimed authorship of the song texts. Brecht would later use elements of ''Happy End'' as the germ for his ''Saint Joan of the Stockyards'', a play that would never see the stage in Brecht's lifetime. ''Happy End'''s score by Weill produced many Brecht/Weill hits like \"Der Bilbao-Song\" and \"Surabaya-Jonny\".\n\nThe masterpiece of the Brecht/Weill collaborations, ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny]]'' (''Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny''), caused an uproar when it premiered in 1930 in Leipzig, with Nazis in the audience protesting. The ''Mahagonny'' opera would premier later in Berlin in 1931 as a triumphant sensation.\n\nBrecht spent the last years of the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar-era]] (1930\u20131933) in Berlin working with his \"collective\" on the ''Lehrst\u00fccke''. These were a group of plays driven by morals, music and Brecht's budding epic theatre. The ''Lehrst\u00fccke'' often aimed at educating workers on Socialist issues. ''[[The Decision (play)|The Measures Taken]]'' (''Die Massnahme'') was scored by [[Hanns Eisler]]. In addition, Brecht worked on a script for a semi-documentary feature film about the human impact of mass unemployment, ''[[Kuhle Wampe]]'' (1932), which was directed by [[Slatan Dudow]]. This striking film is notable for its subversive humour, outstanding [[cinematography]] by [[G\u00fcnther Krampf]], and Hanns Eisler's dynamic musical contribution. It still provides a vivid insight into Berlin during the last years of the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\n=== Nazi Germany and World War II (1933\u20131945) ===\n{{Quote box\n|bgcolor = #c6dbf7\n|quote = Unhappy the land where heroes are needed.\n|source = [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], in Brecht's ''[[Life of Galileo]]'' ([[1943 in literature#New drama|1943]])\n|salign = right\n}}\nFearing persecution, Brecht left [[Nazi Germany]] in February 1933, just after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] took power. After brief spells in Prague, Zurich and Paris he and Weigel accepted an invitation from journalist and author [[Karin Micha\u00eblis]] to move to Denmark. The family first stayed with Karin Micha\u00eblis at her house on the small island of [[Thur\u00f8]] close to the island of [[Funen]]. They later bought their own house in [[Svendborg]] on Funen. This house located at Skovsbo Strand 8 in Svendborg became the residence of the Brecht family for the next six years, where they often received guests including [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Hanns Eisler]] and [[Ruth Berlau]]. During this period Brecht also travelled frequently to Copenhagen, Paris, Moscow, New York and London for various projects and collaborations.\n\nWhen war seemed imminent in April 1939, he moved to [[Stockholm]], Sweden, where he remained for a year.<ref>german.wisc.edu</ref> After Hitler invaded [[Norway]] and Denmark, Brecht left Sweden for [[Helsinki]], Finland, where he lived and waited for his visa for the United States until 3 May 1941.<ref name=\"german.wisc.edu\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.brechtsociety.org/brecht_chronology|title=International Brecht Society \u2013 Brecht Chronology|website=www.brechtsociety.org}}</ref> During this time he wrote the play ''[[Mr Puntila and his Man Matti]]'' (''Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti'') with [[Hella Wuolijoki]], with whom he lived in {{Interlanguage link multi|Marleb\u00e4ck|de}}.\n\nDuring the war years, Brecht became a prominent writer of the [[Exilliteratur]].<ref name=\"Exilliteratur\">Exilliteratur.</ref><ref name=\"Exilliteratur\" /> He expressed his opposition to the National Socialist and Fascist movements in his most famous plays: ''[[Life of Galileo]]'', ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]'', ''[[The Good Person of Szechwan]]'', ''[[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui]]'', ''[[The Caucasian Chalk Circle]]'', ''[[Fear and Misery of the Third Reich]]'', and many others.\n\nBrecht co-wrote the screenplay for the [[Fritz Lang]]-directed film ''[[Hangmen Also Die!]]'' which was loosely based on the 1942 assassination of [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the [[Nazism|Nazi]] Deputy Reich Protector of the German-occupied [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s right-hand man in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], and a chief architect of the [[Holocaust]], who was known as \"The Hangman of Prague.\" [[Hanns Eisler]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for his musical score. The collaboration of three prominent refugees from Nazi Germany&nbsp;\u2013 Lang, Brecht and Eisler&nbsp;\u2013 is an example of the influence this generation of German exiles had on American culture.\n\n''Hangmen Also Die!'' was Brecht's only script for a Hollywood film. The money he earned from writing the film enabled him to write ''[[The Visions of Simone Machard]]'', ''[[Schweik in the Second World War]]'' and an adaptation of [[John Webster|Webster]]'s ''[[The Duchess of Malfi (Brecht)|The Duchess of Malfi]]''.\n\nIn 1942 Brecht's reluctance to help [[Carola Neher]], who died in a [[gulag]] prison in the [[USSR]] after being arrested during the 1936 [[Great Purge|purges]], caused much controversy among Russian emigrants in the West.<ref>{{Interlanguage link multi|Walter Held|de}}: \"Stalins deutsche Opfer und die Volksfront\", in the underground magazine ''Unser Wort'', Nr. 4/5, October 1938, pp. 7 ff.; {{Interlanguage link multi|Michael Rohrwasser|de}}, ''Der Stalinismus und die Renegaten.

Although he was one of 19 witnesses who declared that they would refuse to appear, Brecht eventually decided to testify. He later explained that he had followed the advice of attorneys and had not wanted to delay a planned trip to Europe. On 30 October 1947 Brecht testified that he had never been a member of the [[Communist Party]].<ref name=HUAC2/> He made wry jokes throughout the proceedings, punctuating his inability to speak English well with continuous references to the translators present, who transformed his German statements into English ones unintelligible to himself. HUAC vice-chairman [[Karl E. Mundt|Karl Mundt]] thanked Brecht for his co-operation. The remaining witnesses, the so-called [[Hollywood Ten]], refused to testify and were cited for contempt. Brecht's decision to appear before the committee led to criticism, including accusations of betrayal. The day after his testimony, on 31 October, Brecht returned to Europe.\n\nHe lived in [[Z\u00fcrich|Zurich]] in Switzerland for a year. In February 1948 in [[Chur]], Brecht staged an adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'', based on a translation by [[Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin|H\u00f6lderlin]]. It was published under the title ''Antigonemodell 1948'', accompanied by an essay on the importance of creating a \"[[Non-Aristotelian drama|non-Aristotelian]]\" form of theatre.\n\nIn 1949 he moved to [[East Berlin]] and established his theatre company there, the [[Berliner Ensemble]].  He retained his Austrian nationality (granted in 1950) and overseas bank accounts from which he received valuable hard currency remittances. The copyrights on his writings were held by a Swiss company.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/authors/about_bertolt_brecht.html|title=Bertolt Brecht Biography \u2013 List of Works, Study Guides & Essays|author=GradeSaver}}</ref> At the time he drove a pre-war [[DKW]] car\u2014a rare luxury in the austere divided capital.\n\nThough he was never a member of the Communist Party, Brecht had been schooled in [[Marxism]] by the dissident communist [[Karl Korsch]].

Brecht received the [[Stalin Peace Prize]] in 1954.<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Petersburg Times|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19541221&id=2Y4zAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gHoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3712,12840|date=21 December 1954}}</ref>\n\nBrecht wrote very few plays in his final years in East Berlin, none of them as famous as his previous works. He dedicated himself to directing plays and developing the talents of the next generation of young directors and dramaturgs, such as Manfred Wekwerth, [[Benno Besson]] and [[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Carl Weber]]. At this time he wrote some of his most famous poems, including the \"Buckow Elegies\".\n\nAt first Brecht apparently supported the measures taken by the East German government against the [[uprising of 1953 in East Germany]], which included the use of Soviet military force. In a letter from the day of the uprising to [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] First Secretary [[Walter Ulbricht]], Brecht wrote that: \"History will pay its respects to the revolutionary impatience of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The great discussion [exchange] with the masses about the speed of socialist construction will lead to a viewing and safeguarding of the socialist achievements.

The poem was first printed in the West-German newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' in 1959 and subsequently in the ''Buckow Elegies'' in the West 1964. It was first published in the GDR in 1969 after Helene Weigel had insisted on its inclusion in a collected edition of Brecht's works.</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\n=== Death ===\nBrecht died on 14 August 1956<ref>{{Britannica|78614}}</ref> of a heart attack at the age of 58. He is buried in the Dorotheenst\u00e4dtischer cemetery on Chausseestra\u00dfe in the [[Mitte]] neighbourhood of Berlin, overlooked by the residence he shared with Helene Weigel.\n\nAccording to Stephen Parker, who reviewed Brecht's writings and unpublished medical records, Brecht contracted rheumatic fever as a child, which led to an enlarged heart, followed by lifelong chronic heart failure and [[Sydenham's chorea]]. A report of a radiograph taken of Brecht in 1951 describes a badly diseased heart, enlarged to the left with a protruding [[aortic knob]] and with seriously impaired pumping. Brecht's colleagues described him as being very nervous, and sometimes shaking his head or moving his hands erratically. This can be reasonably attributed to Sydenham's chorea, which is also associated with [[emotional lability]], personality changes, [[obsessive-compulsive]] behavior, and hyperactivity, which matched Brecht's behavior. \"What is remarkable,\" wrote Parker, \"is his capacity to turn abject physical weakness into peerless artistic strength, arrhythmia into the rhythms of poetry, chorea into the choreography of drama.\"<ref name=\"Parker\">{{cite journal | title =Diagnosing Bertolt Brecht.| journal =Lancet| date =2 April 2011| author =Parker S.| volume =377| issue =9772| pages =1146\u20137| url =http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2811%2960453-4/fulltext#| doi =10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60453-4| pmid =21465701| pmc =}}</ref>\n\n== Theory and practice of theatre ==\n[[File:Cremer Brecht.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Brecht outside the Berliner Ensemble's theatre in Berlin]]\nBrecht developed the combined theory and practice of his \"[[Epic theatre]]\" by synthesizing and extending the experiments of [[Erwin Piscator]] and [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]] to explore the theatre as a [[Political theatre|forum for political ideas]] and the creation of a critical aesthetics of [[dialectical materialism]].\n\nEpic Theatre proposed that a play should not cause the spectator to identify emotionally with the characters or action before him or her, but should instead provoke rational self-reflection and a critical view of the action on the stage. Brecht thought that the experience of a [[Climax (narrative)|climactic]] [[catharsis]] of emotion left an audience complacent. Instead, he wanted his audiences to adopt a critical perspective in order to recognise social injustice and exploitation and to be moved to go forth from the theatre and effect change in the world outside.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = A Critical Response to Heidi M. Silcox's \"What's Wrong with Alienation?\"|last = Squiers|first = Anthony|date = 2015|journal = Philosophy and Literature|volume = 39|pages = 243\u2013247|doi = 10.1353/phl.2015.0016|pmid = }}</ref> For this purpose, Brecht employed the use of techniques that remind the spectator that the play is a [[Metatheatre|representation of reality]] and not reality itself. By highlighting the constructed nature of the theatrical event, Brecht hoped to communicate that the audience's reality was equally constructed and, as such, was changeable.\n\nBrecht's [[Modernism|modernist]] concern with drama-as-a-[[Medium specificity|medium]] led to his refinement of the \"[[Non-Aristotelian drama|epic form]]\" of the drama. This dramatic form is related to similar modernist innovations in other [[The arts|arts]], including the strategy of divergent chapters in [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s evolution of a [[Constructivism (art)|constructivist]] \"[[Soviet montage theory|montage]]\" in the cinema, and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s introduction of [[Cubism|cubist]] \"collage\" in the visual arts.<ref>On these relationships, see \"autonomization\" in Jameson (1998, 43\u201358) and \"non-organic work of art\" in B\u00fcrger (1984, 87\u201392).  Willett observes: \"With Brecht the same [[Soviet montage theory|montage]] technique spread to the drama, where the old [[Procrustes|Procrustean]] plot yielded to a more \"[[Non-Aristotelian drama|epic]]\" form of narrative better able to cope with wide-ranging modern socio-economic themes. That, at least, was how Brecht theoretically justified his choice of form, and from about 1929 on he began to interpret its penchant for \"[[contradiction]]s\", much as had [[Sergei Eisenstein]], in terms of the [[dialectic]]. It is fairly clear that in Brecht's case the practice came before the theory, for his actual composition of a play, with its switching around of scenes and characters, even the physical cutting up and sticking together of the typescript, shows that montage was the structural technique most natural to him. Like [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]] and Joyce he had not learnt this scissors-and-paste method from the Soviet cinema but picked it out of the air\" (1978, 110).</ref>\n\nOne of Brecht's most important principles was what he called the ''[[Verfremdungseffekt]]'' (translated as \"defamiliarization effect\", \"distancing effect\", or \"estrangement effect\", and often mistranslated as \"alienation effect\").<ref>Brooker (1994, 193). Brooker writes that \"the term 'alienation' is an inadequate and even misleading translation of Brecht's ''Verfremdung''. The terms 'de-familiarisation' or 'estrangement', when understood as more than purely formal devices, give a more accurate sense of Brecht's intentions. A better term still would be 'de-[[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]'\".</ref> This involved, Brecht wrote, \"stripping the event of its self-evident, familiar, obvious quality and creating a sense of astonishment and curiosity about them\".<ref>Brecht, quoted by Brooker (1994, 191).</ref> To this end, Brecht employed techniques such as the actor's direct address to the audience, harsh and bright stage lighting, the use of songs to [[Interruptions (epic theatre)|interrupt]] the action, explanatory placards, the transposition of text to the [[Grammatical person|third person]] or [[past tense]] in rehearsals, and speaking the stage directions out loud.{{sfn|Brecht|1964|p=138}}\n\nIn contrast to many other [[avant-garde]] approaches, however, Brecht had no desire to [[Anti-art|destroy art]] as an institution; rather, he hoped to \"[[Refunctioning|re-function]]\" the theatre to a new social use. In this regard he was a vital participant in the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] debates of his era\u2014particularly over the \"[[High culture|high art]]/popular culture\" dichotomy\u2014vying with the likes of [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]], [[Ernst Bloch]], and developing a close friendship with [[Walter Benjamin]]. Brechtian theatre articulated popular themes and forms with avant-garde formal experimentation to create a modernist realism that stood in sharp contrast both to its [[Realism (theatre)|psychological]] and [[Socialist realism|socialist]] varieties. \"Brecht's work is the most important and original in European drama since [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] and [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]],\" [[Raymond Williams]] argues, while [[Peter B\u00fcrger]] dubs him \"the most important [[Materialism|materialist]] writer of our time.\"<ref>The quotation from Raymond Williams is on page 277 of his book (1993) and that from Peter B\u00fcrger on page 88 of his (1984).</ref>\n\nBrecht was also influenced by Chinese theatre, and used its aesthetic as an argument for ''Verfremdungseffekt''. Brecht believed, \"Traditional Chinese acting also knows the alienation [sic] effect, and applies it most subtly.<ref>\"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic\" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 91</ref>... The [Chinese] performer portrays incidents of utmost passion, but without his delivery becoming heated.\"<ref>\"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic\" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 92</ref> Brecht attended a Chinese opera performance and was introduced to the famous Chinese opera performer [[Mei Lanfang]] in 1935.<ref>{{Cite journal|jstor=40246399|title=Bertolt Brecht in China and His Impact on Chinese Drama|first=Adrian|last=Hsia|journal=[[Comparative Literature Studies]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=<!-- [northern] Summer --> 1983|pages=231\u2013245}}</ref> However, Brecht was sure to distinguish between Epic and Chinese theatre. He recognized that the Chinese style was not a \"transportable piece of technique,\"<ref>\"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic\" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 95</ref> and that Epic theatre sought to historicize and address social and political issues.<ref>\"Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic\" Translated and Edited by John Willett, page 96</ref>\n\nBrecht used his poetry to criticize European culture, including [[Nazis]], and the German [[bourgeoisie]]. Brecht's poetry is marked by the effects of the First and [[Second World War]]s.\n\nThroughout his theatric production, poems are incorporated into this plays with music. In 1951, Brecht issued a recantation of his apparent suppression of poetry in his plays with a note titled ''On Poetry and Virtuosity''. He writes:\n<blockquote>We shall not need to speak of a play's poetry ... something that seemed relatively unimportant in the immediate past. It seemed not only unimportant, but misleading, and the reason was not that the poetic element had been sufficiently developed and observed, but that reality had been tampered with in its name ... we had to speak of a truth as distinct from poetry ... we have given up examining works of art from their poetic or artistic aspect, and got satisfaction from theatrical works that have no sort of poetic appeal ... Such works and performances may have some effect, but it can hardly be a profound one, not even politically. For it is a peculiarity of the theatrical medium that it communicates awarenesses and impulses in the form of pleasure: the depth of the pleasure and the impulse will correspond to the depth of the pleasure.\n</blockquote>\nBrecht's most influential poetry is featured in his ''Manual of Piety (Devotions)'', establishing him as a noted poet.\n\n== Legacy ==\nBrecht's widow, the actress [[Helene Weigel]], continued to manage the Berliner Ensemble until her death in 1971; it was primarily devoted to performing Brecht's plays.\n\nBesides being an influential dramatist and poet, some scholars have stressed the significance of Brecht's original contributions in political and social philosophy.<ref>{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to the Social and Political Philosophy of Bertolt Brecht|last = Squiers|first = Anthony|publisher = Rodopi|year = 2014|isbn = 9789042038998|location = Amsterdam|pages = }}</ref>\n\nBrecht's collaborations with Kurt Weill have had some influence in rock music.

Jameson describes the creator of the work not as Brecht the individual, but rather as 'Brecht': a collective subject that \"certainly seemed to have a distinctive style (the one we now call 'Brechtian') but was no longer personal in the bourgeois or [[Individualism|individualistic]] sense.\" During the course of his career, Brecht sustained many long-lasting creative relationships with other writers, composers, [[scenographer]]s, directors, [[dramaturg]]s and actors; the list includes: [[Elisabeth Hauptmann]], [[Margarete Steffin]], [[Ruth Berlau]], [[Slatan Dudow]], [[Kurt Weill]], [[Hanns Eisler]], [[Paul Dessau]], [[Caspar Neher]], [[Teo Otto]], [[Karl von Appen]], [[Ernst Busch (actor)|Ernst Busch]], [[Lotte Lenya]], [[Peter Lorre]], [[Therese Giehse]], [[Angelika Hurwicz]], [[Carola Neher]] and Helene Weigel herself.

He was voted the [[SABR]] \"Centennial Celebrity\" of 1983, as the best baseball player or figure born in 1883. However, the SABR ''Baseball Research Journal'' for 1983 acknowledges that there are discrepancies in records about Bender's birth year, ranging from 1883 to 1885. 1884 is the figure most often given.</ref> \u2013 May 22, 1954) was a [[pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] during the 1910s and 1920s. In 1911, Bender tied a record by pitching three [[complete game]]s in a single [[World Series]]. He finished his career with a 212\u2013127 [[win-loss record]] for a .625 winning percentage and a career 2.46 [[earned run average]] (ERA).\n\nAfter his major league playing career, Bender filled multiple baseball roles, including service as a major league coach, minor league manager and player-manager, college manager and professional scout. He was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1953 and he died not long before his induction ceremony the following year.\n\n==Early life==\nBender was born in [[Crow Wing County, Minnesota]], as a member of the [[Ojibwe]] tribe. His father was German and his mother was part Chippewa. As a child, he was given the [[Ojibwe language]] name \"'''Mandowescence'''\", meaning \"Little Spirit Animal\". His family had {{Convert|160|acres||abbr=}} on the [[White Earth Indian Reservation]] near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. His father taught him to farm on the reservation.<ref>Kashatus, pp. 5-6</ref> He graduated from [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] and attended [[Dickinson College]].\n\n==Baseball career==\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 140\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    =Bender1903.png\n| alt1     =\n| caption1 =1903 E107 \"Chief\" Bender (Collection RC)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    =Chiefbender.jpg\n| alt2     =\n| caption2 =Bender in 1911\n}}\n\n===Early career===\nBender debuted in the major leagues in 1903. He is one of only a few pitchers in the 20th century to throw 200 or more innings at the age of 19. His walks per nine innings rate was 2.17; only a few pitchers since 1893 have had a rate below 2.2 at the age of 20 or younger. That year, he also won a game against [[Cy Young]] and even met his future wife Marie.<ref>Swift, p. 108</ref>\n\nIn 1905, Bender earned an 18\u201311 [[win-loss record]] with a 2.83 ERA, helping the A's win the AL pennant, but they lost the World Series in five games to the New York Giants. Bender went 1\u20131, 1.06 ERA in the series, pitching a 4-hit, 3\u20130 complete game shutout in Game 2, striking out 9, and again went the distance in Game 5, giving up just two earned runs in eight innings and losing 2\u20130 to Christy Mathewson.\n\nAfter solid seasons in 1906 (15\u201310, 2.53), 1907 (16\u20138, 2.05), 1908 (8\u20139 despite a 1.75 ERA) and 1909 (18\u20138, 1.66), he led the Athletics to the AL pennant in 1910 as Philadelphia went 102\u201348, 14\u00bd games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees. Bender led the AL in winning percentage at .821, going 23\u20135 with a 1.58 ERA. He went 1\u20131 with a 1.93 ERA in the World Series as the A's beat the Chicago Cubs, who had gone 104\u201350 in the regular season, in five games. Bender pitched a complete-game three-hitter in the opener, striking out 8 and giving up only one unearned run. He lost Game 4 of the series in another complete game effort, 4\u20133 in 10 innings. Bender pitched all 9\u2154 innings for the Athletics, striking out 6.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Moving Picture News (1911) (1911) (14801801473).jpg|right|thumb|260px|The four stars of the world champion Philadelphia Athletics \u2014 Bender, [[Cy Morgan]], [[Jack Coombs]] and [[Rube Oldring]] \u2014 were featured in the [[Thanhouser Company]] film, ''[[The Baseball Bug]]'' (1911)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thanhouser.org/tcocd/Filmography_files/idhud4dk.htm |title=The Baseball Bug |publisher=Thanhouser Company Film Preservation, Inc. |access-date=2016-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107150024/http://www.thanhouser.org/tcocd/Filmography_files/idhud4dk.htm |archive-date=2017-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>]]\nIn 1911, he led the AL in winning percentage again (.773), going 17\u20135 with a 2.16 ERA as the A's won their second consecutive AL pennant, going 101\u201350 and finishing 13\u00bd games ahead of the Detroit Tigers. In a rematch of the 1905 World Series, the Athletics got their revenge, defeating the New York Giants and becoming the first American League team to win back-to-back World Series (the Chicago Cubs from the NL had won back-to-back titles in 1907 and 1908). After losing the opener 2\u20131 to Christy Mathewson, though pitching a complete game, giving up just 5 hits and 2 runs (1 earned run) and striking out 11, he returned in Game 4, beating the Giants 4\u20132 on a complete game 7-hitter, and closed out the Series in game 6 with a 13\u20132 A's victory. Bender again went the distance (his 3rd complete game of the series), a 4-hit performance which he gave up no earned runs (the two Giants runs were unearned). He went 2\u20131, with 1.04 ERA and 3 complete games in the series.\n\nIn 1912 Bender was 13\u20138 with a 2.74 ERA. He did not start for nearly 40 games late in the year and was suspended by the A's in September for alcohol abuse. His next contract had a clause saying he had to abstain from drinking to earn his full salary. In 1913, he went 21\u201310 with a 2.21 ERA, helping the A's win their third AL pennant in four years. They would also make it three World Series titles in four years by defeating the Giants in five games. Bender went 2\u20130 in the series with complete-game victories in Games 1 and 4.\n\nHe led the AL in winning percentage (.850) for the third time in 1914, going 17\u20133 with a 2.26 ERA, and the A's would win their fourth AL pennant in five years. But the Philadelphia Athletics would be swept by the underdog Boston Braves, with Bender losing Game 1 7\u20131 and giving up 6 earned runs in 5\u2153 innings. It was the only World Series game he failed to finish after completing his previous nine starts in the Fall Classic.\n\nWhen the [[Baltimore Terrapins]] of the upstart Federal League offered Bender a significant increase in salary, Athletics manager [[Connie Mack]] knew he could not hope to match it and released him. Bender went 4\u201316 for the Terrapins and later regretted leaving Philadelphia. After two years with the Phillies, he left baseball in 1918 to work in the shipyards during [[World War I]].\n\nOver his career, his win-loss record was 212\u2013127, for a .625 winning percentage (a category in which he led the [[American League]] in three seasons) and a career 2.46 ERA. His talent was even more noticeable in the high-pressure environment of the [[World Series]]; in five trips to the championship series, he managed six wins and a 2.44 [[Earned run average|ERA]], completing 9 of the 10 games he started, putting him 2nd in World Series history behind Christy Mathewson. In the [[1911 World Series|1911 Series]], he pitched three [[complete game]]s to tie [[Christy Mathewson]]'s record of three complete games in a World Series. He also threw a [[no-hitter]] on May 12, 1910, beating the Cleveland Indians 4\u20130.\n\nBender was a very adept hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .212 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (243-for-1,147) with 102 [[run (baseball)|runs]], 6 [[home runs]] and 116 [[RBI]]. He had 10 or more RBI in a season four times, with a career high 16 in 1910.\n\n===Minor leagues===\nIn 1919, Bender pitched in the minor leagues for the [[Richmond Colts]] of the [[Virginia League]]. He earned a 29\u20132 record that year. He spent the next three seasons as a player-manager; the first two seasons were with the New Haven Weissmen/Indians, and the third was with the Class AA Reading Aces. For the 1920 New Haven team, Bender recorded 25 wins as a pitcher. His record declined to 13\u20137 in 1921 and 8\u201313 in 1922.<ref name=BRMinors>{{cite web|title=Chief Bender Minor League Statistics & History|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=bender001cha|website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|accessdate=July 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923 and 1924, Bender did not manage but did pitch for the minor league [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]] and the New Haven Profs, respectively.

After he threw one of the most dominating games of the early years of the American League, Bender was depicted wielding a tomahawk and wearing a headdress as though he was a happy warrior.\"<ref>Swift, p. 5</ref>\n\nHe also faced discrimination on the field. Swift writes that taunting from the bench was common in Bender's era and that the opposition or the fans often made war whoops or yelled taunts such as \"Nig!\" or \"Back to the reservation!\" Bender usually remained calm, sometimes smiling at the insults. After an inning in which he had pitched particularly well, he might yell back, \"Foreigners!

He was voted the [[SABR]] \"Centennial Celebrity\" of 1983, as the best baseball player or figure born in 1883. However, the SABR ''Baseball Research Journal'' for 1983 acknowledges that there are discrepancies in records about Bender's birth year, ranging from 1883 to 1885. 1884 is the figure most often given.</ref> \u2013 May 22, 1954) was a [[pitcher]] in [[Major League Baseball]] during the 1910s and 1920s. In 1911, Bender tied a record by pitching three [[complete game]]s in a single [[World Series]]. He finished his career with a 212\u2013127 [[win-loss record]] for a .625 winning percentage and a career 2.46 [[earned run average]] (ERA).\n\nAfter his major league playing career, Bender filled multiple baseball roles, including service as a major league coach, minor league manager and player-manager, college manager and professional scout. He was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1953 and he died not long before his induction ceremony the following year.\n\n==Early life==\nBender was born in [[Crow Wing County, Minnesota]] as a member of the [[Ojibwe]] tribe. His father was German and his mother was part Chippewa. As a child, he was given the [[Ojibwe language]] name \"'''Mandowescence'''\", meaning \"Little Spirit Animal\". His family had {{Convert|160|acres||abbr=}} on the [[White Earth Indian Reservation]] near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]].

He is one of only a few pitchers in the 20th century to throw 200 or more innings at the age of 19. His walks per nine innings rate was 2.17; only a few pitchers since 1893 have had a rate below 2.2 at the age of 20 or younger. That year, he also won a game against [[Cy Young]] and even met his future wife Marie.<ref>Swift, p. 108</ref>\n\nIn 1905, Bender earned an 18\u201311 [[win-loss record]] with a 2.83 ERA, helping the A's win the AL pennant, but they lost the World Series in five games to the New York Giants. Bender went 1\u20131, 1.06 ERA in the series, pitching a 4-hit, 3\u20130 complete game shutout in Game 2, striking out 9, and again went the distance in Game 5, giving up just two earned runs in eight innings and losing 2\u20130 to Christy Mathewson.\n\nAfter solid seasons in 1906 (15\u201310, 2.53), 1907 (16\u20138, 2.05), 1908 (8\u20139 despite a 1.75 ERA) and 1909 (18\u20138, 1.66), he led the Athletics to the AL pennant in 1910 as Philadelphia went 102\u201348, 14\u00bd games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees. Bender led the AL in winning percentage at .821, going 23\u20135 with a 1.58 ERA. He went 1\u20131 with a 1.93 ERA in the World Series as the A's beat the Chicago Cubs, who had gone 104\u201350 in the regular season, in five games. Bender pitched a complete-game three-hitter in the opener, striking out 8 and giving up only one unearned run. He lost Game 4 of the series in another complete game effort, 4\u20133 in 10 innings. Bender pitched all 9\u2154 innings for the Athletics, striking out 6.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Moving Picture News (1911) (1911) (14801801473).jpg|right|thumb|260px|The four stars of the world champion Philadelphia Athletics \u2014 Bender, [[Cy Morgan]], [[Jack Coombs]] and [[Rube Oldring]] \u2014 were featured in the [[Thanhouser Company]] film, ''[[The Baseball Bug]]'' (1911)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thanhouser.org/tcocd/Filmography_files/idhud4dk.htm |title=The Baseball Bug |publisher=Thanhouser Company Film Preservation, Inc. |access-date=2016-01-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170107150024/http://www.thanhouser.org/tcocd/Filmography_files/idhud4dk.htm |archive-date=2017-01-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>]]\nIn 1911, he led the AL in winning percentage again (.773), going 17\u20135 with a 2.16 ERA as the A's won their second consecutive AL pennant, going 101\u201350 and finishing 13\u00bd games ahead of the Detroit Tigers. In a rematch of the 1905 World Series, the Athletics got their revenge, defeating the New York Giants and becoming the first American League team to win back-to-back World Series (the Chicago Cubs from the NL had won back-to-back titles in 1907 and 1908). After losing the opener 2\u20131 to Christy Mathewson, though pitching a complete game, giving up just 5 hits and 2 runs (1 earned run) and striking out 11, he returned in Game 4, beating the Giants 4\u20132 on a complete game 7-hitter, and closed out the Series in game 6 with a 13\u20132 A's victory. Bender again went the distance (his 3rd complete game of the series), a 4-hit performance which he gave up no earned runs (the two Giants runs were unearned). He went 2\u20131, with 1.04 ERA and 3 complete games in the series.\n\nIn 1912 Bender was 13\u20138 with a 2.74 ERA. He did not start for nearly 40 games late in the year and was suspended by the A's in September for alcohol abuse. His next contract had a clause saying he had to abstain from drinking to earn his full salary. In 1913, he went 21\u201310 with a 2.21 ERA, helping the A's win their third AL pennant in four years. They would also make it three World Series titles in four years by defeating the Giants in five games. Bender went 2\u20130 in the series with complete-game victories in Games 1 and 4.\n\nHe led the AL in winning percentage (.850) for the third time in 1914, going 17\u20133 with a 2.26 ERA, and the A's would win their fourth AL pennant in five years. But the Philadelphia Athletics would be swept by the underdog Boston Braves, with Bender losing Game 1 7\u20131 and giving up 6 earned runs in 5\u2153 innings. It was the only World Series game he failed to finish after completing his previous nine starts in the Fall Classic.\n\nWhen the [[Baltimore Terrapins]] of the upstart Federal League offered Bender a significant increase in salary, Athletics manager [[Connie Mack]] knew he could not hope to match it and released him. Bender went 4\u201316 for the Terrapins and later regretted leaving Philadelphia. After two years with the Phillies, he left baseball in 1918 to work in the shipyards during [[World War I]].\n\nOver his career, his win-loss record was 212\u2013127, for a .625 winning percentage (a category in which he led the [[American League]] in three seasons) and a career 2.46 ERA. His talent was even more noticeable in the high-pressure environment of the [[World Series]]; in five trips to the championship series, he managed six wins and a 2.44 [[Earned run average|ERA]], completing 9 of the 10 games he started, putting him 2nd in World Series history behind Christy Mathewson. In the [[1911 World Series|1911 Series]], he pitched three [[complete game]]s to tie [[Christy Mathewson]]'s record of three complete games in a World Series. He also threw a [[no-hitter]] on May 12, 1910, beating the Cleveland Indians 4\u20130.\n\nBender was a very adept hitting pitcher in his major league career, posting a .212 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (243-for-1,147) with 102 [[run (baseball)|runs]], 6 [[home runs]] and 116 [[RBI]]. He had 10 or more RBI in a season four times, with a career high 16 in 1910.\n\n===Minor leagues===\nIn 1919, Bender pitched in the minor leagues for the [[Richmond Colts]] of the [[Virginia League]]. He earned a 29\u20132 record that year. He spent the next three seasons as a player-manager; the first two seasons were with the New Haven Weissmen/Indians, and the third was with the Class AA Reading Aces. For the 1920 New Haven team, Bender recorded 25 wins as a pitcher.

He then returned to the Athletics where he worked the rest of his life as a scout, minor league manager, and coach.\n\n==Personal==\nBender was nicknamed \"Chief\", a common nickname for baseball players of Native American descent.<ref>Swift, p. 4</ref> Biographer Tom Swift writes that Bender \"was often portrayed as a caricature and was the subject of myriad cartoons \u2013 many exhibits of narrow-mindedness. After he threw one of the most dominating games of the early years of the American League, Bender was depicted wielding a tomahawk and wearing a headdress as though he was a happy warrior.\"<ref>Swift, p. 5</ref>\n\nHe also faced discrimination on the field. Swift writes that taunting from the bench was common in Bender's era and that the opposition or the fans often made war whoops or yelled taunts such as \"Nig!\" or \"Back to the reservation!\" Bender usually remained calm, sometimes smiling at the insults. After an inning in which he had pitched particularly well, he might yell back, \"Foreigners! Foreigners!\"<ref>Swift, p. 6</ref>\n\nOff the baseball field, Bender was one of several prominent baseball players who enjoyed [[trap shooting]], bowling and golf.<ref name=Salon>{{cite web|last1=Kaufman|first1=King|title=Chief Bender's Burden (review)|url=http://www.salon.com/2008/05/23/bender/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon.com]]|accessdate=November 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Trap>{{cite news|title=Big Chief Bender trap-shooting star|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19150302&id=qvkgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Y3UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3270,241701|accessdate=November 1, 2014|work=[[The Day (New London)]]|date=March 2, 1915}}</ref> He felt that shooting in the offseason helped to train his eye and increase his self-control.

Bender, also played professional baseball. John Bender was suspended from minor league baseball for three years beginning in 1908 after he stabbed his manager, [[Win Clark]], several times during a fight.

He grew a number of fruits and vegetables, especially corn, and either ate, sold or gave away what he grew.<ref>Swift, pp. 281-282</ref> After the 1950 season, Bender took his last position in the major leagues, replacing [[Mickey Cochrane]] as the pitching coach for the Athletics.<ref>Kashatus, p. 146</ref> Bender's coaching helped pitcher [[Bobby Shantz]] to the [[American League Most Valuable Player Award]] in 1952.<ref>Kashatus, p. 148</ref> Bender was struggling with health problems, including arthritis and a cancer he did not disclose, during his tenure with Philadelphia.<ref>Kashatus, p. 149</ref>\n\nIn his last days, Bender remained close friends with Athletics coach [[Bing Miller]], who used to bring Bender a container of ice cream almost every day. Bender was hospitalized in Philadelphia in mid-April 1954. He died there on May 22, 1954, of [[prostate cancer]]. He had also been suffering from cardiac problems.<ref>Swift, p. 285</ref> While he had been hospitalized, Bender sent Marie to [[Shibe Park]] for each home game so that she could report back to him on his team's pitching. Bender was buried in the Philadelphia suburb of [[Roslyn, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=Kashatus152/>\n\n==Legacy==\nBender was well liked by his fellow players.
