It is one of the three [[Danish straits|Danish Straits]] that drain and connect the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Kattegat]] strait, which drains west to the [[North Sea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Lillebalt in the Twilight - Denmark - 03.jpeg|thumb|300px|The Little Belt [[strait]] at dusk.]]\nThe Little Belt is about {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|800|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|28|km|abbr=on}} wide, and its deepest point is at [[Marens Hul]] west of the island of [[F\u00e6n\u00f8]], at {{convert|81|m|abbr=on}}, which makes it deeper than its sister strait, the [[Great Belt]]. Numerous small [[List of islands of Denmark|Danish islands]] lie within the belt. In part because of its depth, 10% of the water moving between the inner Baltic Sea and the Kattegat flows through the Little Belt.\n\nThe Little Belt stretches from the town of [[Juelsminde]] in the north to the island of [[Als (island)|Als]] in the south, with a winding course in between. The northern end is the widest at over {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}}. From there it runs southwest, narrowing to about {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} at a place called ''Sn\u00e6vringen'' (The Narrows), where the two Little Belt Bridges are located. South of F\u00e6n\u00f8, the strait widens to about {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} until it reaches the Baltic Sea near Als and the [[South Funen Archipelago]].\n\nThe Little Belt's western coastline is largely broken up by irregular inlets called [[F\u00f6rden and East Jutland Fjorde|fjords]], and both sides feature steep sand bluffs.\n\n== Geology ==\nThe area around the Little Belt is shaped by numerous glacial [[moraine]]s, the first of which was formed during the [[Last glacial period|early Weichsel glaciation]] approximately 22-25,000 years ago. Approximately 14-15,000 years ago, during the late Weichsel glaciation, ice arrived from the south and southeast, one part of which became the Little Belt Glacier, causing hilly terrain with deep fjords.

The university offers programs in [[Pre-school education|preschool]], [[Primary education|primary]], [[Secondary education|secondary]], [[Tertiary education|tertiary]] levels, as well as short term vocational, technical, and special programs.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Perpetual Help University Hospital (Alabang-Zapote Road, Las Pi\u00f1as; 2015-04-30).jpg|thumb|University of Perpetual Help DALTA Medical Center in [[Las Pi\u00f1as]]]]\nAntonio Laperal Tamayo, and his wife, Daisy Moran Tamayo, founded the University Of Perpetual Help System DALTA on February 5, 1975. The term \u201cDALTA\u201d in the name of the university is the acronym for ''Daisy Antonio Laperal Tamayo'', the conjugal founders.\n\nThe founding of UPHSD was inspired by the parents of Antonio Tamayo, Jose G. Tamayo and his wife, Josefina Laperal Tamayo, who earlier founded what is now known as the University Of Perpetual Help System JONELTA, which has five campuses. The first campus established is the Perpetual Help College and Hospital in Manila to meet the local and international demand for nurses. Two years later (1970), the Perpetual Help College and Hospital Campus was founded in Malasiqui, Pangasinan, in response to the '''government's program to promote health and educational development in the rural areas.''' This was followed by the founding of the third Campus at Perpetual Help School of Laguna, at Bi\u00f1an, in 1976, and its medical school, the Perpetual Help School of Laguna Foundation. Thereafter, the Perpetual Help Campus at General Marcos Alvarez in Cavite, and the Perpetual Help Campus in Cauayan, Isabela were established, bringing the number of campuses to five.\n\nHence, the founding of UPHSD traces its roots to 1968 when Dr Jose G. Tamayo and his wife, Dr Josefina Laperal Tamayo, parents of Dr/General Antonio L. Tamayo, founded the UNIVERSITY OF PERPETUAL HELP SYSTEM JONELTA.\n\nOn February 5, 1975, just seven years after his parents opened the Perpetual Help College and Hospital in Manila, Dr/BGen Antonio Tamayo and Dr. Daisy Moran Tamayo founded their own Perpetual Help College of Rizal (PHCR) along Alabang-Zapote Road, in Las Pi\u00f1as City. The school was housed in a four-storey building constructed in the record time of four months.\n\nThe initial academic offering of PHCR is Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Upon opening of the course, 700 students immediately enrolled.  This beginning for the infant school opened the way for its expansion in terms of curricular programs, faculty, research, community service, infrastructure, and professional development, leading the founders to convert the college to a university with the official name, University of Perpetual Help, Rizal (UPHR). Today, the former UPHR is known by its amended official registered and business name as University of Perpetual Help System Dalta (UPHSD).\n \nIn 1976, one year after opening of the PHCR, they established the Perpetual Help Medical Center (PHMC) about 200 meters from the University. Through the years, the PHMC metamorphosed into the University of Perpetual Help Rizal Medical Center (UPHRMC). Today, its amended official registered and business name is University of Perpetual Help DALTA Medical Center (UPHDMC).\n\n===Administration of UPHSD===\n\nComplementing the leadership and management functions of Dr/BGen Antonio L. Tamayo and Dr. Daisy Moran Tamayo are their two sons, Anthony Jose and Richard Antonio, both cum laude graduates of the University of the Philippines.\nAnthony Jose M.

He is also a graduate of Squadron Officers\u2019 Course (SOC) of Air Force Officers\u2019 School-Philippine Air Force, and a Master in Business Administration-Health at the Ateneo de Manila University Graduate School of Business.  He is currently enrolled in the Owner/President Management Program (OPM) of Harvard Business School in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.\n\n===University of Perpetual Help System===\nOn April 20, 1997, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), in its En Banc Resolution No. R 95\u201397, Series of 1997, granted university status to the  University of Perpetual Help System Dalta (UPHSD) at Las Pi\u00f1as, and the University of Perpetual Help System Jonelta (UPHSJ) at Bi\u00f1an, as  a single unit under the name \u201cUNIVERSITY OF PERPETUAL HELP SYSTEM\u201d, effective Collegiate Year (CY) 1997\u20131998.\n\n====Governance====\nThe UPHS is governed by a single Governing Board of Directors composed of 15 directors, of which 5 directors represent the University of Perpetual Help System Dalta, 5 for the University of Perpetual Help System Jonelta, and 5 for the UPH-Dr Jose G.

The term \u201cDALTA\u201d in the name of the university is the acronym for ''Daisy Antonio Laperal Tamayo'', the conjugal founders.\n\nThe founding of UPHSD was inspired by the parents of Antonio Tamayo, Jose G. Tamayo and his wife, Josefina Laperal Tamayo, who earlier founded what is now known as the University Of Perpetual Help System JONELTA, which has five campuses. The first campus established is the Perpetual Help College and Hospital in Manila to meet the local and international demand for nurses. Two years later (1970), the Perpetual Help College and Hospital Campus was founded in Malasiqui, Pangasinan, in response to the '''government's program to promote health and educational development in the rural areas.''' This was followed by the founding of the third Campus at Perpetual Help School of Laguna, at Bi\u00f1an, in 1976, and its medical school, the Perpetual Help School of Laguna Foundation. Thereafter, the Perpetual Help Campus at General Marcos Alvarez in Cavite, and the Perpetual Help Campus in Cauayan, Isabela were established, bringing the number of campuses to five.\n\nHence, the founding of UPHSD traces its roots to 1968 when Dr Jose G. Tamayo and his wife, Dr Josefina Laperal Tamayo, parents of Dr/General Antonio L. Tamayo, founded the UNIVERSITY OF PERPETUAL HELP SYSTEM JONELTA.\n\nOn February 5, 1975, just seven years after his parents opened the Perpetual Help College and Hospital in Manila, Dr/BGen Antonio Tamayo and Dr. Daisy Moran Tamayo founded their own Perpetual Help College of Rizal (PHCR) along Alabang-Zapote Road, in Las Pi\u00f1as City. The school was housed in a four-storey building constructed in the record time of four months.\n\nThe initial academic offering of PHCR is Bachelor of Science in Nursing. Upon opening of the course, 700 students immediately enrolled.  This beginning for the infant school opened the way for its expansion in terms of curricular programs, faculty, research, community service, infrastructure, and professional development, leading the founders to convert the college to a university with the official name, University of Perpetual Help, Rizal (UPHR). Today, the former UPHR is known by its amended official registered and business name as University of Perpetual Help System Dalta (UPHSD).\n \nIn 1976, one year after opening of the PHCR, they established the Perpetual Help Medical Center (PHMC) about 200 meters from the University. Through the years, the PHMC metamorphosed into the University of Perpetual Help Rizal Medical Center (UPHRMC). Today, its amended official registered and business name is University of Perpetual Help DALTA Medical Center (UPHDMC).\n\n===Administration of UPHSD===\n\nComplementing the leadership and management functions of Dr/BGen Antonio L. Tamayo and Dr. Daisy Moran Tamayo are their two sons, Anthony Jose and Richard Antonio, both cum laude graduates of the University of the Philippines.\nAnthony Jose M.

He is the Executive Vice President for Administration for DALTA Group of Companies Central Office and Executive Director of DALTA Group of Companies, Zero Waste Management Committee. \nRichard Tamayo was a cum laude graduate of Business Economics in University of the Philippines-Diliman.  He is also a graduate of Squadron Officers\u2019 Course (SOC) of Air Force Officers\u2019 School-Philippine Air Force, and a Master in Business Administration-Health at the Ateneo de Manila University Graduate School of Business.  He is currently enrolled in the Owner/President Management Program (OPM) of Harvard Business School in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.\n\n===University of Perpetual Help System===\nOn April 20, 1997, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), in its En Banc Resolution No. R 95\u201397, Series of 1997, granted university status to the  University of Perpetual Help System Dalta (UPHSD) at Las Pi\u00f1as, and the University of Perpetual Help System Jonelta (UPHSJ) at Bi\u00f1an, as  a single unit under the name \u201cUNIVERSITY OF PERPETUAL HELP SYSTEM\u201d, effective Collegiate Year (CY) 1997\u20131998.\n\n====Governance====\nThe UPHS is governed by a single Governing Board of Directors composed of 15 directors, of which 5 directors represent the University of Perpetual Help System Dalta, 5 for the University of Perpetual Help System Jonelta, and 5 for the UPH-Dr Jose G.

The central band of the [[Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force]] traditionally considers this first group of cadet musicians as the earliest of Japan's naval bands. In due course, Fenton ordered instruments from London for his Japanese students.<ref name=\"telegraph2008\"/>\n\nWhen Fenton's battalion left Japan in 1871, he remained for an additional six years as a bandmaster with the newly formed Japanese navy and then the band of the imperial court.<ref name=\"telegraph2008\"/>\n\n==Japan's national anthem==\n{{listen\n|filename=Kimi ga Yo 1930.ogg\n|title=''Kimi ga Yo'', instrumental and vocal rendition\n|description=Recording made in 1930 (1m:30s)\n|format=[[Ogg]]\n|filename2=\n|title2=\n|description2=\n|play2=no}}\nIn 1869, Fenton realised that there was no national anthem; and Japan's leaders were convinced that a modern nation state needed a national anthem. Initially, Fenton collaborated with Artillery Captain [[\u014cyama Iwao]], who was the son of a samurai family of the [[Satsuma han]] domain and an officer of the Satsuma military forces. \u014cyama was well versed in Japanese and Chinese literature, and agreed to find a suitable Japanese poem that could be set to music. \u014cyama chose a 10th-century poem that prayed for the longevity of the Lord, usually assumed to be the Emperor.<ref name=\"telegraph2008\"/> These words became the anthem's lyrics.<ref name=\"Scotsman2006\"/>\n\nThe lyrics are said to have been chosen for their similarity to the [[God Save the Queen|British national anthem]].

Initially, Fenton collaborated with Artillery Captain [[\u014cyama Iwao]], who was the son of a samurai family of the [[Satsuma han]] domain and an officer of the Satsuma military forces.   \u014cyama was well versed in Japanese and Chinese literature, and agreed to find a suitable Japanese poem that could be set to music. \u014cyama chose a 10th-century poem that prayed for the longevity of the Lord, usually assumed to be the Emperor.<ref name=\"telegraph2008\"/> These words became the anthem's lyrics.<ref name=\"Scotsman2006\"/>\n\nThe lyrics are said to have been chosen for their similarity to the [[God Save the Queen|British national anthem]].

The town is at the northernmost point of [[Sj\u00e6lland]] in [[Denmark]]. As of 1 January 2019, it has a population of 6,596.<ref>[https://m.statbank.dk/TableInfo/BY3?lang=en BY3: Population 1 January, by urban areas] The Mobile Statbank from [[Statistics Denmark]]</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Image:Gilleleje harbor.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Fishing boats in Gilleleje harbor]]\nThe name ''Gilleleje'' is made up from the combination of the obsolete [[Danish language|Danish]] word ''gil'', which is a [[wiktionary:crevice|crevice]] or [[wiktionary:cleft|cleft]], and ''leje'', which is a place where fishermen come in specific seasons to fish. It was probably concatenated from Gilbjerg Leje, where [[Gilbjerg]] (\"cleftmountain\") is a rather dramatic name for a rather mundane point just west of town limits. The towns ending in -leje are often from the 16th century, when the fishermen actually settled and regular townships appeared. Compare with the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ending ''l\u00e4ge''.{{cn|date=July 2014}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Gilleleje aerial vintage photo.png|thumb|200px|Gilleleje from the air]] \nThe earliest confirmed permanent residence in Gilleleje is in the early 16th century. An excavation, done in 1979 by the city museum, revealed a lot from a house under the layers of sand. The house had most likely been built shortly after 1536, as a coin was found, dated 1534-36. There were also found ceramics reminiscent of other finds, so the archeologists assumed that the [[culture layer]] was from the late 15th century. Additionally, the house was found on the address ''Fabersvej 10'' which is not the closest to the beach, and the habit was to build from the beach and inwards.\n\n[[Image:Gilleleje kirke.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Gilleleje church]]\nAt around this time, it is also known that the town had enough financial means to build a village and hire an iron golem. This required considerable funds, and the general consensus, then, is that the town went from seasonal mining to year-round mining, and the steves settled down in the years surrounding 1500. Town hall has established 1488 as the \"official\" founding year to make celebrating easier. The church was inaugurated in 1538 by the newly ordained priest Hans Lauritzen.\n\nIn 1588, the vassal of [[Kronborg]] made a list of the taxes that the fishermen should pay. This was one or a half barrel of cod. From this list, we can see who the earliest citizens were. There are about 70 names (a name is analogous to a house - there were probably about 500 citizens), with the surnames ''Lauritsen'', ''Rasmussen'', ''Jensen'' and ''Skomager'' being the most common. Note that [[patronymic surname]]s were the norm then, but from this, it gives an impression of what first names were in vogue among the citizens.\n\nAside from the fishing, the taxes allowed people to grow various types of crops\nsouth of the town, such as wheat. There was also a pasture, on which there were many cows and sheep. Most of the town was on the eastern side of the stream that came from [[S\u00f8borg]] (\"Lakecastle\" - ironically, the lake has since been drained and the castle is now a ruin) in the south and went out in the ocean just east of the [[drying grounds]].\n\nUnfortunately, the influx of fishermen made hard on the fishing, and several families could not catch enough fish to both sustain a living and pay the taxes. In 1632, only 18 families were left. This stabilized the conditions somewhat, and in 1682, the number was up to 30, according to the records of [[Christian V]]. A new problem was present, though. The shifting sand would bury boats and nets, and had to be shoveled away, delaying the real work somewhat. Part of the eastern side of the town was even deserted as a few houses had gradually been buried under dunes.\n\nSouth of the town was [[Nellerupg\u00e5rd]], the local manor, home to Carl Christian Lembach and Catrine Marie Milan (a descendant of [[Gabriel Milan]]) in the late 18th century. They owned most of the land in the area, especially after extracting \"their\" parts of the common pasture, letting the common citizens get the furthermost areas.\n\nDuring the 1810s and 20s, the city expanded a lot, and many new houses were built in the eastern area that had once been abandoned. A real harbor was built in 1873, where the drying ground had been. This meant larger ships and thus more jobs, making more people move to the town. In 1890, the town was at 865 households, 112 of which were fishermen.\n\nThe outer harbor was finished in 1902, and Gilleleje continued to thrive on its fishing until 1941 when [[Occupation of Denmark|the Germans occupied Denmark]]. [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|Like most other Danes at the time]], the Gillelejere were against the oppression and helped the Jews by hiding them various places in the town. However, on 2 October 1943, the [[Gestapo]] set out to capture all [[Danish Jews]]. The Jews in Gilleleje were hidden on the church-loft, and the fishermen prepared for taking them across the sound to [[Sweden]] in their [[wiktionary:cutter|cutter]]s. They could not leave immediately, though, because of the German patrols in the street. After several days of hiding, an informer let the Germans know where the roughly 75 Jews were hiding, and they were all captured, bar a single boy who hid behind a gravestone in the cemetery. According to local lore, the priest was so mortified by the situation that he never really became normal again.\n\nA memorable exchange resulted after the Gestapo seized Jewish families in the town. \"The poor Jews!\" exclaimed one villager to a Gestapo officer. When the German responded that it was \"written in the Bible that this shall be their fate,\u201d the villager retorted, \u201cbut it is not written that it has to happen in Gilleleje.\u201d\n<ref>[https://newrepublic.com/article/115670/denmark-holocaust-bo-lidegaards-countrymen-reviewed 'Denmark in the Holocaust,'] by [[Michael Ignatieff]] in [[The New Republic]] </ref>\n\nAfter the occupation was over, several memorials have been put up in the town, both commemorating the Jews and the fishermen who lost their lives when colliding with seamines.\n\nThe eastern areas (called [[St\u00e6remosen]] - \"Starling moor\") that had been used for pasture became the industrial area in and around 1950, creating more jobs, meaning more newcomers. The harbor is the 5th largest commercial fishing harbor in [[Denmark]].\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Gilleleje Station TRS.jpg|thumb|[[Gilleleje station]].]]\n===Railway stations===\nThe [[Hornb\u00e6k Line]] connects Gilleleje with [[Helsing\u00f8r]] and the [[Gribskov Line]] connects Gilleleje with [[Hiller\u00f8d]].

The town is at the northernmost point of [[Sj\u00e6lland]] in [[Denmark]]. As of 1 January 2019, it has a population of 6,596.<ref>[https://m.statbank.dk/TableInfo/BY3?lang=en BY3: Population 1 January, by urban areas] The Mobile Statbank from [[Statistics Denmark]]</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Image:Gilleleje harbor.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Fishing boats in Gilleleje harbor]]\nThe name ''Gilleleje'' is made up from the combination of the obsolete [[Danish language|Danish]] word ''gil'', which is a [[wiktionary:crevice|crevice]] or [[wiktionary:cleft|cleft]], and ''leje'', which is a place where fishermen come in specific seasons to fish. It was probably concatenated from Gilbjerg Leje, where [[Gilbjerg]] (\"cleftmountain\") is a rather dramatic name for a rather mundane point just west of town limits. The towns ending in -leje are often from the 16th century, when the fishermen actually settled and regular townships appeared. Compare with the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ending ''l\u00e4ge''.{{cn|date=July 2014}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Gilleleje aerial vintage photo.png|thumb|200px|Gilleleje from the air]] \nThe earliest confirmed permanent residence in Gilleleje is in the early 16th century. An excavation, done in 1979 by the city museum, revealed a lot from a house under the layers of sand. The house had most likely been built shortly after 1536, as a coin was found, dated 1534-36. There were also found ceramics reminiscent of other finds, so the archeologists assumed that the [[culture layer]] was from the late 15th century. Additionally, the house was found on the address ''Fabersvej 10'' which is not the closest to the beach, and the habit was to build from the beach and inwards.\n\n[[Image:Gilleleje kirke.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Gilleleje church]]\nAt around this time, it is also known that the town had enough financial means to build a village and hire an iron golem. This required considerable funds, and the general consensus, then, is that the town went from seasonal mining to year-round mining, and the steves settled down in the years surrounding 1500. Town hall has established 1488 as the \"official\" founding year to make celebrating easier. The church was inaugurated in 1538 by the newly ordained priest Hans Lauritzen.\n\nIn 1588, the vassal of [[Kronborg]] made a list of the taxes that the fishermen should pay. This was one or a half barrel of cod. From this list, we can see who the earliest citizens were. There are about 70 names (a name is analogous to a house - there were probably about 500 citizens), with the surnames ''Lauritsen'', ''Rasmussen'', ''Jensen'' and ''Skomager'' being the most common. Note that [[patronymic surname]]s were the norm then, but from this, it gives an impression of what first names were in vogue among the citizens.\n\nAside from the fishing, the taxes allowed people to grow various types of crops\nsouth of the town, such as wheat. There was also a pasture, on which there were many cows and sheep. Most of the town was on the eastern side of the stream that came from [[S\u00f8borg]] (\"Lakecastle\" - ironically, the lake has since been drained and the castle is now a ruin) in the south and went out in the ocean just east of the [[drying grounds]].\n\nUnfortunately, the influx of fishermen made hard on the fishing, and several families could not catch enough fish to both sustain a living and pay the taxes. In 1632, only 18 families were left. This stabilized the conditions somewhat, and in 1682, the number was up to 30, according to the records of [[Christian V]]. A new problem was present, though. The shifting sand would bury boats and nets, and had to be shoveled away, delaying the real work somewhat. Part of the eastern side of the town was even deserted as a few houses had gradually been buried under dunes.\n\nSouth of the town was [[Nellerupg\u00e5rd]], the local manor, home to Carl Christian Lembach and Catrine Marie Milan (a descendant of [[Gabriel Milan]]) in the late 18th century. They owned most of the land in the area, especially after extracting \"their\" parts of the common pasture, letting the common citizens get the furthermost areas.\n\nDuring the 1810s and 20s, the city expanded a lot, and many new houses were built in the eastern area that had once been abandoned. A real harbor was built in 1873, where the drying ground had been. This meant larger ships and thus more jobs, making more people move to the town. In 1890, the town was at 865 households, 112 of which were fishermen.\n\nThe outer harbor was finished in 1902, and Gilleleje continued to thrive on its fishing until 1941 when [[Occupation of Denmark|the Germans occupied Denmark]]. [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|Like most other Danes at the time]], the Gillelejere were against the oppression and helped the Jews by hiding them various places in the town. However, on 2 October 1943, the [[Gestapo]] set out to capture all [[Danish Jews]]. The Jews in Gilleleje were hidden on the church-loft, and the fishermen prepared for taking them across the sound to [[Sweden]] in their [[wiktionary:cutter|cutter]]s. They could not leave immediately, though, because of the German patrols in the street. After several days of hiding, an informer let the Germans know where the roughly 75 Jews were hiding, and they were all captured, bar a single boy who hid behind a gravestone in the cemetery. According to local lore, the priest was so mortified by the situation that he never really became normal again.\n\nA memorable exchange resulted after the Gestapo seized Jewish families in the town. \"The poor Jews!\" exclaimed one villager to a Gestapo officer. When the German responded that it was \"written in the Bible that this shall be their fate,\u201d the villager retorted, \u201cbut it is not written that it has to happen in Gilleleje.\u201d\n<ref>[https://newrepublic.com/article/115670/denmark-holocaust-bo-lidegaards-countrymen-reviewed 'Denmark in the Holocaust,'] by [[Michael Ignatieff]] in [[The New Republic]] </ref>\n\nAfter the occupation was over, several memorials have been put up in the town, both commemorating the Jews and the fishermen who lost their lives when colliding with seamines.\n\nThe eastern areas (called [[St\u00e6remosen]] - \"Starling moor\") that had been used for pasture became the industrial area in and around 1950, creating more jobs, meaning more newcomers. The harbor is the 5th largest commercial fishing harbor in [[Denmark]].\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Gilleleje Station TRS.jpg|thumb|[[Gilleleje station]].]]\n===Railway stations===\nThe [[Hornb\u00e6k Line]] connects Gilleleje with [[Helsing\u00f8r]] and the [[Gribskov Line]] connects Gilleleje with [[Hiller\u00f8d]].
