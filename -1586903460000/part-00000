This type of terrain commonly has rocks, roots, loose dirt, and steep grades. Many trails have additional [[Glossary of cycling#TTF |TTF]]s (Technical Trail Features) such as [[Glossary of cycling#log pile |log pile]]s, [[Glossary of cycling#log ride |log ride]]s, [[Glossary of cycling#rock garden |rock gardens]], [[Glossary of cycling#skinny |skinnies]], [[Glossary of cycling#gap jump |gap jump]]s, and [[Glossary of cycling#wall-ride |wall-ride]]s. Mountain bikes are built{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} to handle these types of terrain and features.

(1999). Mountain biking. Mechanicsburg, PA: Stackpole Books.</ref>\n\nSince the development of the sport of [[mountain biking]] in the 1970s, many new subtypes of mountain biking have developed, such as [[Cross-country cycling| cross-country (XC)]], all-day endurance, [[freeride]], [[Downhill mountain biking| downhill]], and a variety of track and slalom types. Each of these place different demands on the bike, requiring different designs for optimal performance. MTB development has led to an increase in suspension travel, now often up to {{convert|8|in|mm}}, and gearing up to 27 speeds, to facilitate both climbing and rapid descents. Advances in [[Bicycle gearing| gearing]] have also led to a \"1x\" (pronounced \"one-by\") trend, simplifying the gearing to one [[Chainset| chainring]] in the front and a [[Cogset#Cassettes |cassette]] at the rear, typically with 9 to 12 [[sprocket]]s.\n\nThe expressions \"all terrain bicycle\", \"all terrain bike\", and the acronym \"ATB\" are used as synonyms for \"mountain bike\",<ref>{{cite book\n| title = The History of Cycling in Fifty Bikes\n| author = Tom Ambrose\n| publisher = Rodale Press\n| date = 2013\n| page = 157\n| quote = They were well placed to exploit the coming market, but the company thought all-terrain bikes would be a short-lived phenomenon.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.livestrong.com/article/185083-the-best-all-terrain-bikes/\n| title = The Best All-Terrain Bikes\n| author = Max Roman Dilthey\n| date = February 5, 2014\n| publisher = LiveStrong.com\n| quote = All-terrain bikes come suited to a variety of disciplines and conditions. \n| accessdate = 2017-05-21}}</ref><ref name = BikeRadar>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/gear/article/what-is-a-29er-28684/\n| title = What is a 29er?\n| author = Steve Worland\n| work = BikeRadar\n| quote = Unfortunately, the Moulton ATB had a fairly fundamental flaw.\n| date = September 18, 2012\n| accessdate = 27 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| title = Sloane's Complete Book of All-terrain Bicycles\n| author = Eugene A.

The front suspension is usually a [[Bicycle fork#Suspension|telescopic fork]] similar to that of a motorcycle, and the rear is suspended by a mechanical linkage with components for absorbing shock.\n\n===Discipline-oriented designs===\nThere are several different styles of mountain biking, usually defined by the terrain, and therefore the type of bicycles employed.  Styles have evolved rapidly.\n\n'''[[Cross-country cycling|Cross country]]''' bicycles are designed primarily around the discipline of cross country racing. Emphasis is on endurance which demands lightweight and efficient designs. In the 1980s and early 1990s, this typically consisted of a lightweight steel rigid frame and fork. Throughout the 1990s, lightweight aluminum frames and short travel (65 to 110&nbsp;mm) suspension forks gained influence. Full suspension designs have since become more popular among racers and enthusiasts. The use of advanced carbon fiber composites allows designers to produce full-suspension designs under {{convert|10|kg|lb}}. [[29er (bicycle)|700c wheels]] have largely replaced the original standard of 26\". Typical head angles are 70\u201371\u00b0, a geometry which favors climbing ability and fast responses over descending and stability. Although intended for off-road use, they are not designed for use on steep or particularly rough terrain. \n\n'''\"Trail\" bicycles are a development from cross country and are generally used by recreational cyclists. They typically have 120\u2013140&nbsp;mm (5\") of travel, weigh {{convert|11|to|15|kg|lb}}, with geometry situated somewhere between cross country and All-Mountain designs. Examples include the Giant Trance, the Trek Fuel EX series, and the Specialized Stumpjumper FSR. Having a slacker head angle (68-69\u00b0) provides greater stability while descending. With less of an emphasis on weight, typically they are designed to handle rougher terrain.\n\n'''Enduro/all-mountain (AM)''' bikes bridge the gap between cross-country and free-ride bikes, such as the Trek Remedy and Specialized Enduro series, typically weighing between {{convert|13|to|16|kg|lb}}. These bikes tend to feature greater suspension travel, frequently as much as {{convert|6|in|mm}} or {{convert|7|in|mm}} of front and rear travel that is often adjustable on newer mid- and high-end bikes, and slacker head angles (65-66\u00b0). Designed to be able to climb and descend well, these bikes are intended to be taken on all-day rides involving both steep climbs and steep descents, hence the term 'all-mountain'. In terms of aggressiveness, these bikes are intended for anywhere from 50-70% downhill riding, and 30-50% uphill riding, bridging the gap between trail and downhill bikes. In recent years, there has been somewhat of a split between Enduro and All-Mountain bikes, with the former placing more emphasis on descent due to the increased emphasis on timed downhill runs in [[Enduro (mountain biking)|Enduro]] racing when compared to more typical all-mountain riding.\n[[File:SpecializedBigHit2.jpeg|thumb|An upgraded [[Downhill mountain biking|Downhill]]/[[Freeride]] bike: Specialized Bighit 2006 with {{convert|203|mm|in}} of travel in the front and {{convert|190|mm|in}} of travel in the back.]]\n\n'''[[Downhill bike|Downhill]] (DH)''' bikes typically have {{convert|8|in|mm}} or more of suspension travel, and extremely low, slack geometry (head angles of 63-64\u00b0) intended to set the rider in a comfortable position when descending steep trails at high speed. Due to their often high gear ratios, soft suspension, and aggressive geometry, Downhill bikes are ideal only for riding down dedicated trails or race courses, almost universally requiring the bike to be carried or shuttled uphill rather than ridden. Downhill frames are often intended for racing, and as such are required to be both extremely durable and lightweight. Bicycle designers often make use of similar materials in the construction of Downhill and XC frames and components (e.g. carbon fiber), despite their vastly different purposes, as the ultimate goal of a high strength to weight ratio is the same. In recent years, more advanced frame and component designs have produced high-end downhill bikes with similar weights to average Trail and All-Mountain bikes, with an increasing expectation that complete downhill bikes remain below 40&nbsp;lbs (18&nbsp;kg) even in budget models. This advancement, along with increased speeds and forces in racing, and the use of downhill frames for freeride applications, has necessitated or otherwise inspired many unique design features and advancements in design present on Downhill bikes, many of which later find use on less aggressive types of bikes (bash guards, clutch derailleurs, wide handlebars, advanced air suspension, bimetallic brake rotors, slack and long geometry). Several types of [[Fastest speed on a bicycle|bicycle speed records]] have been registered using Downhill bikes.\n\n'''[[Freeride]] (FR)''' mountain bikes are similar to downhill bikes, with less emphasis on weight and more on strength, though many frame and component manufacturers no longer distinguish the two in their downhill oriented products. Free-ride bikes have ample suspension and typically have at least {{convert|7|in|mm}} of travel. Free-ride bikes are intended for trail features with large air time, such as jumps and drops, and as such are designed to handle heavy impacts, whether from landings or crashes. Free-ride frames and parts are rarely made from carbon fiber due to strength and durability concerns and are instead usually made from aluminum, sacrificing marginal weight gain for more predictable material response under heavy usage. Certain free-ride specific bikes can be ridden uphill more easily than downhill bikes, but are inefficient in pedaling and difficult to maneuver while angled uphill. Originally, free-ride bikes sat between All-Mountain and downhill bikes in geometry, with frame angles steeper than those found in downhill bikes and higher rider positioning, enhancing maneuverability on [[Glossary of cycling#technical|technical]] or low-speed features commonly found on \"North Shore\" style trails. Free-ride bikes typically range in weight from {{convert|14|to|20|kg|lb}}, with the wide variability resulting from the variety of components applicable for the purpose. Slopestyle and Dirt Jump bikes are included in this category by some, due to similar purposes, but the distinction in bike design is significant between the three.\n\n'''[[Dirt jumping]], urban and street''' mountain bikes lie somewhere in between a BMX bike and a free-ride bike. They are either arranged as rigid or hard-tail bikes, with {{convert|3|to|4.5|in|mm}} of front suspension, and rigid, durable frames with low bottom brackets and short chainstays to improve maneuverability. Dirt Jump bikes often overlap in design with Four-Cross bikes, though that discipline has largely fallen out of favor, with many frames including removable derailleur hangers and/or integrated chain tensioners to allow for single speed and multi-speed arrangements (Four-Cross bikes mostly use derailleurs while Dirt Jumpers usually use single speed setups). Tires on these bikes are usually 24 or 26\" diameter, fast-rolling slicks or semi-slicks, with narrow casings (approx. 1.8-2.2\"). Dirt jumpers usually have low [[seatpost]]s and oversized handlebars, to make room for tricks. Most dirt jumpers have an extended rear brake cable installed and have no front brake, which allows the rider to spin the handle bars multiple times without tangling the brake cables.\n\n'''[[Slopestyle|Slope-style]] (SS)''' bikes are a strange blend of Dirt Jump and Free-ride bikes, having the geometry similar to Dirt Jumpers, but with approximately 4\" (100mm) of suspension travel in both the front and rear. These bikes are mostly used by professional slope-style riders, this specific usage being their origin, and as such are designed for the extremely large jumps and high speeds encountered in competition. The frames are either adapted from existing All-Mountain or Free-ride designs or designed specifically for the purpose, with durable frame designs and sophisticated suspension linkages to make the most of their minimal suspension travel. These bikes usually have relatively slack head angles, relative to their short suspension travel, with a slightly more aggressive overall geometry than the Dirt Jumpers many are based on. These bikes are often equipped with a mix of Dirt Jump and All-Mountain interface specifications (headset size, bottom bracket style, rear axle width and diameter, rear derailleur hanger) to accommodate both Free-ride and Dirt Jump components as necessary to handle the high speeds and harsh impacts associated with their use. Slope-style bikes are also used for light downhill or trail riding by many, if not riding jumps on the same scale as professional riders, with their durability and sophisticated suspension designs allowing for extra versatility when compared to Dirt Jump bikes.\n\n'''[[Bike trials|Trials]]''' bikes are set up very specifically for the purpose of bicycle trials. Two varieties of trials bike exist, those with 26\" wheels (referred to as 'stock') and those with 20\" wheels (referred to as 'mod' because historically they were modified BMX bikes). They typically have no suspension at all, though some still make use of some form of it. Competition rules require stock bikes to have multiple gears for competition, but most riders never use their shifters. Competition rules do not require mod bikes to have any gears. Many non-competitive riders run single-speed, choosing a fairly low-speed, high-torque gear. Most modern trials bikes have no seat at all, as the rider spends all of his time out of the saddle, and trials riding is not conducive to the use of the saddle as a control interface as in normal mountain biking. These bikes are significantly lighter than almost all other mountain bikes, ranging from {{convert|7|to|11|kg|lb}}. This makes maneuvering the bike much easier.\n[[File:Dirtbike on sylt.jpg|thumb|A simple [[Dirt jumping|dirt jump]] bike.]]\n\n'''[[Single-speed bicycle|Single-speed]] (SS)''' mountain bikes have one set gear ratio. The gear ratio chosen depends on the terrain being ridden, the strength and skill of the rider, and the size of the bike (a bike with 29\" wheels often requires a different gearing than a bike with 26\" wheels). Often single-speeds are fully rigid, steel-framed bikes. These are typically ridden by very fit individuals on mild to moderate cross country terrain.\n\n'''[[Four-cross|Mountain cross or \"Four-cross\" (4X)]]''' is a type of racing in which four bikers race downhill on a prepared, BMX style track. These bikes generally fall under the categories of Dirt Jump or Slope-style designs, with the main distinctions being the use of a derailleur rather than a single speed setup, or slightly slacker head angles than ordinary Dirt Jump bikes for increased stability at race speeds. Four-Cross racing has fallen in popularity recently, with the UCI removing Four-Cross from the World Cup due to excessive erosion and inconvenience caused by the purpose-built race tracks.\n\n'''Dual slalom (DS)''' is similar to Four-cross, but instead of four competing cyclists during a race, there are only two, racing in parallel lanes. The courses are in general more [[Glossary of cycling#technical|technical]] with smaller jumps than Four-cross courses. Dual Slalom races originally took place on grass slopes with gates and minimal jumps, but are now held on man-made courses. Dual slalom racers will usually use Dirt Jump, Slope-style, or Dirt Jump bikes.\n\n'''Indycross (IX)'''  is essentially a Mountain Cross event featuring a wide variety of features run by one competitor per time.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://diablofreeridepark.com/indycross.html\n|title = Diablo Freeride Park\n|accessdate = 2008-09-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080503100742/http://diablofreeridepark.com/indycross.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-03}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Mountain biking in British Columbia|North Shore]]''' bikes are much like free-ride bikes in their geometry and downhill bikes in their component makeup. Because north shore stunts have evolved to not only include simple and complex bridges but also large drops and high-speed descents through a series of stunts north shore bikes commonly have as much travel as downhill and freeride bikes, however with much more nimble and maneuverable frame designs, and often lighter weight.\n\n'''Circle dirt track racing''' In this class of racing any kind of bikes are used, most commonly a hard tail mountain bike with front suspension. Many different modifications are made to track racing bikes, such as reducing bike weight, increasing brake power, trying different cambers (so that when the bike leans the tire is more level with the track thus creating more grip), and trying different gear ratios.\n\nIn the earliest days of mountain biking, all mountain bikes were somewhat custom, home-built machines, and were used for any number of stunts, tricks, racing or other activities. The general design of the bikes were similar. As the sport grew, more specialized designs and equipment were introduced. The further market segmentation beyond simple front suspension XC bicycles began to occur in the mid-1990s, as large bicycle and equipment manufacturers were able to cater specifically to changing demands.\n\n==Modern designs==\n[[File:2002 Trek 800 Sport.JPG|thumb|A 2002 rigid 21 speed Trek 800 Sport]]\n\n===Gears===\n{{Main|Bicycle gearing}}\nSince the 1980s,<ref name=\"Reinventing\">{{cite journal|date=1 August 1992|title=Reinventing the wheel|journal=The Economist|volume=324|issue=7770|pages=61\u201362}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruibal\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/cycling/2006-03-22-cycling-bikes_x.htm|title=Still shredding after all these years|last=Ruibal|first=Sal|date=22 March 2006|work=USA Today|accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref> mountain bikes have had anywhere from 7 to 27 speeds, with 1 to 3 chain-rings on the [[crankset]] and 4 to 12 sprockets in the [[cogset]]. 30-speed and 33-speed mountain bikes were found to be unworkable, as the mud-shedding capabilities of a 10-speed or 11-speed cassette, and the intricacies of a 10-speed or 11-speed rear derailleur have never been suitable. However, many pro-level mountain bikers have taken to using a narrower 10-speed road chain with a 9-speed setup in an effort to reduce the weight of their bike. In early 2009, component group [[SRAM Corporation|SRAM]] announced their release of their XX groupset, which uses a 2-speed front derailleur, and a 10-speed rear derailleur and cassette, similar to that of a road bike. Mud-shedding capabilities of their 10-speed XX cassette are made suitable for MTB use by extensive CNC machining of the cassette. Due to the time and cost involved in such a product, they were only aimed at top-end XC-racers. However, 10-speed has become the norm by 2011 and the market leader [[Shimano]] even offers its budget groupset \"Alivio\" in a 10-speed version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikerumor.com/2011/03/16/bikerumor-chain-challenge-the-definitive-9-vs-10-speed-mtb-chain-wear-test/|title=BikeRumor Chain Challenge: The Definitive 9 VS 10 Speed MTB Chain Wear Test|work=Bikerumor|accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> In July 2012, SRAM announced a 1x11 drivetrain called XX1 that does not make use of a front derailleur for lighter weight and simplicity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/news/article/sram-xx1-set-for-release-in-october-2012-34457/|title=SRAM XX1 set for release in October 2012|author=BikeRadar UK|work=BikeRadar|accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref>\nIn the 2014 Commonwealth Games at Glasgow all leading riders used 1x11 drivetrains. SRAM's new 1x12 gearing was introduced in 2016 as SRAM Eagle. This gives a single chain ring bike better ability to climb.\n\n===Geometry===\n{{main|Bicycle frame#Frame geometry|l1=Bicycle frame geometry}}\nThe critical angles in [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry|bicycle geometry]] are the [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Steering axis angle|head angle]] (the angle of the [[Bicycle frame#Head tube|head tube]]), and the seat tube angle (the angle of the [[Bicycle frame#Seat tube|seat tube]]). These angles are measured from the horizontal, and drastically affect the rider position and performance characteristics of the bicycle. Mountain bike geometry will often feature a seat tube angle around 73 degrees, with a head tube angle of anywhere from 60-73 degrees. The intended application of the bike affects its geometry very heavily. In general, steeper angles (closer to 90 degrees from the horizontal) are more efficient for pedaling up hills and make for sharper handling. Slacker angles (leaning farther from the vertical) are preferred for high speeds and downhill stability.\n\n===Suspension===\n[[File:Full suspension mountain bike.jpg|thumb|A full suspension mountain bike]]\n\n{{main|Bicycle suspension}}\n\nIn the past mountain bikes had a rigid frame and fork. In the early 1990s, the first mountain bikes with suspension forks were introduced. This made riding on rough terrain easier and less physically stressful. The first front suspension forks had about 1\u00bd to 2&nbsp;inches (38 to 50&nbsp;mm) of suspension travel. Once suspension was introduced, bikes with front suspension and rigid, non-suspended rear wheels, or \"hardtails\", became popular nearly overnight. While the hardtail design has the benefits of lower cost, less maintenance, and better pedaling efficiency, it is slowly losing popularity due to improvements in full suspension designs. Front fork suspensions are now available with {{convert|8|in|mm}} of travel or more (see above under \"Design.\")\n\nMany new mountain bikes integrate a \"full suspension\" design known as Dual Suspension, meaning that both the front and rear wheel are fitted with a shock absorber in some form as the wheel attaches to the bike. This provides a smoother ride as the front and rear wheels can now travel up and down to absorb the force of obstacles striking the tires. Dual suspension bikes of a similar quality are considerably more expensive, but this price increase brings an enormous off-road performance upgrade as dual suspension bikes are much faster on downhill and technical/rough sections, than other forms of the mountain bike. This is because when the wheel strikes an obstacle its tendency is to bounce up. Due to some forward energy being lost in the upward movement some speed is lost. Dual Suspension bikes solve this problem by absorbing this upward force and transmit it into the shocks of the front and rear wheels, drastically decreasing the translation of forward momentum into useless upward movement. Disadvantages of rear suspension are increased weight, increased price, and with some designs, decreased pedaling efficiency, which is especially noticeable when cycling on roads and hard trails. At first, early rear suspension designs were overly heavy, and susceptible either to pedaling-induced bobbing or lockout.\n\n===Disc brakes===\n[[File:BrakeDiskVR.JPG|thumb|A front disc brake, mounted to the fork and hub]]\n{{about||further information see|Bicycle brake#Disc brakes|general information|Disc brake}}\n\nMost new mountain bikes use disc brakes. They offer much improved stopping power (less lever pressure is required providing greater braking modulation) over rim brakes under all conditions especially adverse conditions, because they are located at the center of the wheel (on the wheel hub).  They therefore remain drier and cleaner than wheel rims, which are more readily soiled or damaged.  The disadvantage of disc brakes is their increased cost and often greater weight. Disc brakes do not allow heat to build up in the tires on long descents; instead, heat builds up in the rotor, which can become extremely hot.\n\n==Wheel and tire design==\nTypical features of a mountain bike are wide knobby tires. The original 26 inch [[bicycle wheel|wheel]] diameter with ~2.125\" width ([[ISO 5775#Rims|ISO]] 559&nbsp;mm rim diameter) is increasingly being displaced by 29 inch wheels with ~2.35\" width (ISO 622&nbsp;mm rim diameter), as well as the 27.5 inch wheel diameter with ~2.25 widths (ISO 584&nbsp;mm rim diameter). Mountain bikes with 24 inch wheels are also available, sometimes for dirt jumping, or as a junior bike.<ref name=\"brown\"/>\n\nBicycle wheel sizes are not precise measurements: a 29-inch mountain bike wheel with a {{convert|622|mm|inch}} bead seat diameter (the term, bead seat diameter (BSD), is used in the [[ETRTO]] tire and rim sizing system), and the average 29\" mountain bike tire is (in ISO notation) 59-622 corresponds to an outside diameter of about 29.15 inches (740&nbsp;mm).<ref name=\"brown\"/>\n\n622&nbsp;mm wheels are standard on road bikes and are commonly known as 700C. In some countries, mainly in [[Continental Europe]], 700C (622&nbsp;mm) wheels are commonly called 28&nbsp;inch wheels.<ref name=\"brown\">{{cite web\n|url = http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html\n|title = Sheldon Brown: Tire Sizing Systems\n|accessdate = 2008-09-21}}</ref> 24&nbsp;inch wheels are used for dirt jumping bikes and sometimes on freeride bikes, rear wheel only, as this makes the bike more maneuverable. 29&nbsp;inch wheels were once used for only Cross Country purposes, but are now becoming more commonplace in other disciplines of mountain biking. A mountain bike with 29\" wheels is often referred to as a [[29er (bicycle)|29er]], and a bike with 27.5 inch wheels is called a [[27.5 Mountain bike|27.5 mountain bike]] or as a marketing term \u2033650B bike\u2033.<ref name=\"brown\"/>\n\nWheels come in a variety of widths, ranging from standard [[Bicycle wheel#Rim|rims]] suitable for use with tires in the 1.90 to 2.10 [[Inch|in]] (48 to 53&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]]) size, to {{convert|2.35|and|3.00|in|mm|abbr=on}} widths popular with freeride and downhill bicycles. Although heavier wheelsets are favored in the freeride and downhill disciplines, advances in wheel technology continually shave weight off strong wheels. This is highly advantageous as rolling weight greatly affects handling and control, which are very important to the technical nature of freeride and downhill riding.\n[[File:15-07-19-Fahrradcorso-RalfR-DSCF6576 1.jpg|thumb|A [[Fatbike|fat tire bicycle]]]]\nThe widest wheel/tire widths, typically 3.8 in (97&nbsp;mm) or larger, are sometimes used by [[icebiking|icebikers]] who use their mountain bikes for winter-time riding in snowy conditions.\n\nManufacturers produce [[bicycle tire]]s with a wide variety of tread patterns to suit different needs. Among these styles are: slick street tires, street tires with a center ridge and outer tread, fully knobby, front-specific, rear-specific, and snow studded. Some tires can be specifically designed for use in certain weather (wet or dry) and terrain (hard, soft, muddy, etc.) conditions. Other tire designs attempt to be all-around applicable. Within the same intended application, more expensive tires tend to be lighter and have less rolling resistance. Sticky Rubber tires are now available for use on freeride and downhill bikes. While these tires wear down more quickly, they provide greater traction in all conditions, especially during cornering. Tires and rims are available in either tubed or tubeless designs, with [[tubeless tire]]s recently (2004) gaining favor for their pinch flat resistance.\n\nTires also come with tubes, tubeless and tubeless-ready.  Tires with tubes are the standard design and the easiest to use and maintain.  Tubeless tires often have better performance because you can run them at a lower tire pressure which results in better traction and increasing rolling resistance.  Tubeless-ready tires are tires that can use tubes or go tubeless.  A liquid sealant is used without the tube to secure the seal to the rim.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Dan|author2=Charlie Layton|title=Know Your Rubber|journal=Mountain Bike|date=May 2009|page=51}}</ref>  Popular tire manufacturers include [[Wilderness Trail Bikes]], Schwalbe, Maxxis, Nokian, Michelin, Continental, Tioga, Kenda, Hutchinson Specialized and Panaracer.\n\n==Tandems==\n[[File:Tandem VTT doublettrack Tthunder.jpg|thumb|right|A tandem, full-suspension mountain bike]]\nMountain bikes are available in [[tandem bicycle|tandem]] configurations.

Each of these place different demands on the bike, requiring different designs for optimal performance. MTB development has led to an increase in suspension travel, now often up to {{convert|8|in|mm}}, and gearing up to 27 speeds, to facilitate both climbing and rapid descents. Advances in [[Bicycle gearing| gearing]] have also led to a \"1x\" (pronounced \"one-by\") trend, simplifying the gearing to one [[Chainset| chainring]] in the front and a [[Cogset#Cassettes |cassette]] at the rear, typically with 9 to 12 [[sprocket]]s.\n\nThe expressions \"all terrain bicycle\", \"all terrain bike\", and the acronym \"ATB\" are used as synonyms for \"mountain bike\",<ref>{{cite book\n| title = The History of Cycling in Fifty Bikes\n| author = Tom Ambrose\n| publisher = Rodale Press\n| date = 2013\n| page = 157\n| quote = They were well placed to exploit the coming market, but the company thought all-terrain bikes would be a short-lived phenomenon.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.livestrong.com/article/185083-the-best-all-terrain-bikes/\n| title = The Best All-Terrain Bikes\n| author = Max Roman Dilthey\n| date = February 5, 2014\n| publisher = LiveStrong.com\n| quote = All-terrain bikes come suited to a variety of disciplines and conditions. \n| accessdate = 2017-05-21}}</ref><ref name = BikeRadar>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/gear/article/what-is-a-29er-28684/\n| title = What is a 29er?\n| author = Steve Worland\n| work = BikeRadar\n| quote = Unfortunately, the Moulton ATB had a fairly fundamental flaw.\n| date = September 18, 2012\n| accessdate = 27 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| title = Sloane's Complete Book of All-terrain Bicycles\n| author = Eugene A.

The front suspension is usually a [[Bicycle fork#Suspension|telescopic fork]] similar to that of a motorcycle, and the rear is suspended by a mechanical linkage with components for absorbing shock.\n\n===Discipline-oriented designs===\nThere are several different styles of mountain biking, usually defined by the terrain, and therefore the type of bicycles employed.  Styles have evolved rapidly.\n\n'''[[Cross-country cycling|Cross country]]''' bicycles are designed primarily around the discipline of cross country racing. Emphasis is on endurance which demands lightweight and efficient designs. In the 1980s and early 1990s, this typically consisted of a lightweight steel rigid frame and fork. Throughout the 1990s, lightweight aluminum frames and short travel (65 to 110&nbsp;mm) suspension forks gained influence. Full suspension designs have since become more popular among racers and enthusiasts. The use of advanced carbon fiber composites allows designers to produce full-suspension designs under {{convert|10|kg|lb}}. [[29er (bicycle)|700c wheels]] have largely replaced the original standard of 26\". Typical head angles are 70\u201371\u00b0, a geometry which favors climbing ability and fast responses over descending and stability. Although intended for off-road use, they are not designed for use on steep or particularly rough terrain. \n\n'''\"Trail\" Bikes''' are a development of XC bikes that are generally used by recreational mountain bikers either at purpose built \"trail centers\" or on natural off-road trails. They usually have around 120\u2013140&nbsp;mm (5\") of travel, weigh {{convert|11|to|15|kg|lb}}, and have geometries situated somewhere between full XC and All-Mountain bikes. Examples include the Giant Trance, the Trek Fuel EX series, and the Specialized Stumpjumper FSR, among many others. With less of an emphasis on weight, trail bikes are typically built to handle rougher terrain than dedicated XC bikes while having slacker head angles (68-69\u00b0) which provide greater stability while descending. Trail bikes are designed for approximately 60-70% uphill, and 30-40% downhill riding.\n\n'''Enduro/all-mountain (AM)''' bikes bridge the gap between cross-country and free-ride bikes, such as the Trek Remedy and Specialized Enduro series, typically weighing between {{convert|13|to|16|kg|lb}}. These bikes tend to feature greater suspension travel, frequently as much as {{convert|6|in|mm}} or {{convert|7|in|mm}} of front and rear travel that is often adjustable on newer mid- and high-end bikes, and slacker head angles (65-66\u00b0). Designed to be able to climb and descend well, these bikes are intended to be taken on all-day rides involving both steep climbs and steep descents, hence the term 'all-mountain'. In terms of aggressiveness, these bikes are intended for anywhere from 50-70% downhill riding, and 30-50% uphill riding, bridging the gap between trail and downhill bikes. In recent years, there has been somewhat of a split between Enduro and All-Mountain bikes, with the former placing more emphasis on descent due to the increased emphasis on timed downhill runs in [[Enduro (mountain biking)|Enduro]] racing when compared to more typical all-mountain riding.\n[[File:SpecializedBigHit2.jpeg|thumb|An upgraded [[Downhill mountain biking|Downhill]]/[[Freeride]] bike: Specialized Bighit 2006 with {{convert|203|mm|in}} of travel in the front and {{convert|190|mm|in}} of travel in the back.]]\n\n'''[[Downhill bike|Downhill]] (DH)''' bikes typically have {{convert|8|in|mm}} or more of suspension travel, and extremely low, slack geometry (head angles of 63-64\u00b0) intended to set the rider in a comfortable position when descending steep trails at high speed. Due to their often high gear ratios, soft suspension, and aggressive geometry, Downhill bikes are ideal only for riding down dedicated trails or race courses, almost universally requiring the bike to be carried or shuttled uphill rather than ridden. Downhill frames are often intended for racing, and as such are required to be both extremely durable and lightweight. Bicycle designers often make use of similar materials in the construction of Downhill and XC frames and components (e.g. carbon fiber), despite their vastly different purposes, as the ultimate goal of a high strength to weight ratio is the same. In recent years, more advanced frame and component designs have produced high-end downhill bikes with similar weights to average Trail and All-Mountain bikes, with an increasing expectation that complete downhill bikes remain below 40&nbsp;lbs (18&nbsp;kg) even in budget models. This advancement, along with increased speeds and forces in racing, and the use of downhill frames for freeride applications, has necessitated or otherwise inspired many unique design features and advancements in design present on Downhill bikes, many of which later find use on less aggressive types of bikes (bash guards, clutch derailleurs, wide handlebars, advanced air suspension, bimetallic brake rotors, slack and long geometry). Several types of [[Fastest speed on a bicycle|bicycle speed records]] have been registered using Downhill bikes.\n\n'''[[Freeride]] (FR)''' mountain bikes are similar to downhill bikes, with less emphasis on weight and more on strength, though many frame and component manufacturers no longer distinguish the two in their downhill oriented products. Free-ride bikes have ample suspension and typically have at least {{convert|7|in|mm}} of travel. Free-ride bikes are intended for trail features with large air time, such as jumps and drops, and as such are designed to handle heavy impacts, whether from landings or crashes. Free-ride frames and parts are rarely made from carbon fiber due to strength and durability concerns and are instead usually made from aluminum, sacrificing marginal weight gain for more predictable material response under heavy usage. Certain free-ride specific bikes can be ridden uphill more easily than downhill bikes, but are inefficient in pedaling and difficult to maneuver while angled uphill. Originally, free-ride bikes sat between All-Mountain and downhill bikes in geometry, with frame angles steeper than those found in downhill bikes and higher rider positioning, enhancing maneuverability on [[Glossary of cycling#technical|technical]] or low-speed features commonly found on \"North Shore\" style trails. Free-ride bikes typically range in weight from {{convert|14|to|20|kg|lb}}, with the wide variability resulting from the variety of components applicable for the purpose. Slopestyle and Dirt Jump bikes are included in this category by some, due to similar purposes, but the distinction in bike design is significant between the three.\n\n'''[[Dirt jumping]], urban and street''' mountain bikes lie somewhere in between a BMX bike and a free-ride bike. They are either arranged as rigid or hard-tail bikes, with {{convert|3|to|4.5|in|mm}} of front suspension, and rigid, durable frames with low bottom brackets and short chainstays to improve maneuverability. Dirt Jump bikes often overlap in design with Four-Cross bikes, though that discipline has largely fallen out of favor, with many frames including removable derailleur hangers and/or integrated chain tensioners to allow for single speed and multi-speed arrangements (Four-Cross bikes mostly use derailleurs while Dirt Jumpers usually use single speed setups). Tires on these bikes are usually 24 or 26\" diameter, fast-rolling slicks or semi-slicks, with narrow casings (approx. 1.8-2.2\"). Dirt jumpers usually have low [[seatpost]]s and oversized handlebars, to make room for tricks. Most dirt jumpers have an extended rear brake cable installed and have no front brake, which allows the rider to spin the handle bars multiple times without tangling the brake cables.\n\n'''[[Slopestyle|Slope-style]] (SS)''' bikes are a strange blend of Dirt Jump and Free-ride bikes, having the geometry similar to Dirt Jumpers, but with approximately 4\" (100mm) of suspension travel in both the front and rear. These bikes are mostly used by professional slope-style riders, this specific usage being their origin, and as such are designed for the extremely large jumps and high speeds encountered in competition. The frames are either adapted from existing All-Mountain or Free-ride designs or designed specifically for the purpose, with durable frame designs and sophisticated suspension linkages to make the most of their minimal suspension travel. These bikes usually have relatively slack head angles, relative to their short suspension travel, with a slightly more aggressive overall geometry than the Dirt Jumpers many are based on. These bikes are often equipped with a mix of Dirt Jump and All-Mountain interface specifications (headset size, bottom bracket style, rear axle width and diameter, rear derailleur hanger) to accommodate both Free-ride and Dirt Jump components as necessary to handle the high speeds and harsh impacts associated with their use. Slope-style bikes are also used for light downhill or trail riding by many, if not riding jumps on the same scale as professional riders, with their durability and sophisticated suspension designs allowing for extra versatility when compared to Dirt Jump bikes.\n\n'''[[Bike trials|Trials]]''' bikes are set up very specifically for the purpose of bicycle trials. Two varieties of trials bike exist, those with 26\" wheels (referred to as 'stock') and those with 20\" wheels (referred to as 'mod' because historically they were modified BMX bikes). They typically have no suspension at all, though some still make use of some form of it. Competition rules require stock bikes to have multiple gears for competition, but most riders never use their shifters. Competition rules do not require mod bikes to have any gears. Many non-competitive riders run single-speed, choosing a fairly low-speed, high-torque gear. Most modern trials bikes have no seat at all, as the rider spends all of his time out of the saddle, and trials riding is not conducive to the use of the saddle as a control interface as in normal mountain biking. These bikes are significantly lighter than almost all other mountain bikes, ranging from {{convert|7|to|11|kg|lb}}. This makes maneuvering the bike much easier.\n[[File:Dirtbike on sylt.jpg|thumb|A simple [[Dirt jumping|dirt jump]] bike.]]\n\n'''[[Single-speed bicycle|Single-speed]] (SS)''' mountain bikes have one set gear ratio. The gear ratio chosen depends on the terrain being ridden, the strength and skill of the rider, and the size of the bike (a bike with 29\" wheels often requires a different gearing than a bike with 26\" wheels). Often single-speeds are fully rigid, steel-framed bikes. These are typically ridden by very fit individuals on mild to moderate cross country terrain.\n\n'''[[Four-cross|Mountain cross or \"Four-cross\" (4X)]]''' is a type of racing in which four bikers race downhill on a prepared, BMX style track. These bikes generally fall under the categories of Dirt Jump or Slope-style designs, with the main distinctions being the use of a derailleur rather than a single speed setup, or slightly slacker head angles than ordinary Dirt Jump bikes for increased stability at race speeds. Four-Cross racing has fallen in popularity recently, with the UCI removing Four-Cross from the World Cup due to excessive erosion and inconvenience caused by the purpose-built race tracks.\n\n'''Dual slalom (DS)''' is similar to Four-cross, but instead of four competing cyclists during a race, there are only two, racing in parallel lanes. The courses are in general more [[Glossary of cycling#technical|technical]] with smaller jumps than Four-cross courses. Dual Slalom races originally took place on grass slopes with gates and minimal jumps, but are now held on man-made courses. Dual slalom racers will usually use Dirt Jump, Slope-style, or Dirt Jump bikes.\n\n'''Indycross (IX)'''  is essentially a Mountain Cross event featuring a wide variety of features run by one competitor per time.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://diablofreeridepark.com/indycross.html\n|title = Diablo Freeride Park\n|accessdate = 2008-09-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080503100742/http://diablofreeridepark.com/indycross.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-03}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Mountain biking in British Columbia|North Shore]]''' bikes are much like free-ride bikes in their geometry and downhill bikes in their component makeup. Because north shore stunts have evolved to not only include simple and complex bridges but also large drops and high-speed descents through a series of stunts north shore bikes commonly have as much travel as downhill and freeride bikes, however with much more nimble and maneuverable frame designs, and often lighter weight.\n\n'''Circle dirt track racing''' In this class of racing any kind of bikes are used, most commonly a hard tail mountain bike with front suspension. Many different modifications are made to track racing bikes, such as reducing bike weight, increasing brake power, trying different cambers (so that when the bike leans the tire is more level with the track thus creating more grip), and trying different gear ratios.\n\nIn the earliest days of mountain biking, all mountain bikes were somewhat custom, home-built machines, and were used for any number of stunts, tricks, racing or other activities. The general design of the bikes were similar. As the sport grew, more specialized designs and equipment were introduced. The further market segmentation beyond simple front suspension XC bicycles began to occur in the mid-1990s, as large bicycle and equipment manufacturers were able to cater specifically to changing demands.\n\n==Modern designs==\n[[File:2002 Trek 800 Sport.JPG|thumb|A 2002 rigid 21 speed Trek 800 Sport]]\n\n===Gears===\n{{Main|Bicycle gearing}}\nSince the 1980s,<ref name=\"Reinventing\">{{cite journal|date=1 August 1992|title=Reinventing the wheel|journal=The Economist|volume=324|issue=7770|pages=61\u201362}}</ref><ref name=\"Ruibal\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/cycling/2006-03-22-cycling-bikes_x.htm|title=Still shredding after all these years|last=Ruibal|first=Sal|date=22 March 2006|work=USA Today|accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref> mountain bikes have had anywhere from 7 to 27 speeds, with 1 to 3 chain-rings on the [[crankset]] and 4 to 12 sprockets in the [[cogset]]. 30-speed and 33-speed mountain bikes were found to be unworkable, as the mud-shedding capabilities of a 10-speed or 11-speed cassette, and the intricacies of a 10-speed or 11-speed rear derailleur have never been suitable. However, many pro-level mountain bikers have taken to using a narrower 10-speed road chain with a 9-speed setup in an effort to reduce the weight of their bike. In early 2009, component group [[SRAM Corporation|SRAM]] announced their release of their XX groupset, which uses a 2-speed front derailleur, and a 10-speed rear derailleur and cassette, similar to that of a road bike. Mud-shedding capabilities of their 10-speed XX cassette are made suitable for MTB use by extensive CNC machining of the cassette. Due to the time and cost involved in such a product, they were only aimed at top-end XC-racers. However, 10-speed has become the norm by 2011 and the market leader [[Shimano]] even offers its budget groupset \"Alivio\" in a 10-speed version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikerumor.com/2011/03/16/bikerumor-chain-challenge-the-definitive-9-vs-10-speed-mtb-chain-wear-test/|title=BikeRumor Chain Challenge: The Definitive 9 VS 10 Speed MTB Chain Wear Test|work=Bikerumor|accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref> In July 2012, SRAM announced a 1x11 drivetrain called XX1 that does not make use of a front derailleur for lighter weight and simplicity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/news/article/sram-xx1-set-for-release-in-october-2012-34457/|title=SRAM XX1 set for release in October 2012|author=BikeRadar UK|work=BikeRadar|accessdate=27 August 2015}}</ref>\nIn the 2014 Commonwealth Games at Glasgow all leading riders used 1x11 drivetrains. SRAM's new 1x12 gearing was introduced in 2016 as SRAM Eagle. This gives a single chain ring bike better ability to climb.\n\n===Geometry===\n{{main|Bicycle frame#Frame geometry|l1=Bicycle frame geometry}}\nThe critical angles in [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry|bicycle geometry]] are the [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Steering axis angle|head angle]] (the angle of the [[Bicycle frame#Head tube|head tube]]), and the seat tube angle (the angle of the [[Bicycle frame#Seat tube|seat tube]]). These angles are measured from the horizontal, and drastically affect the rider position and performance characteristics of the bicycle. Mountain bike geometry will often feature a seat tube angle around 73 degrees, with a head tube angle of anywhere from 60-73 degrees. The intended application of the bike affects its geometry very heavily. In general, steeper angles (closer to 90 degrees from the horizontal) are more efficient for pedaling up hills and make for sharper handling. Slacker angles (leaning farther from the vertical) are preferred for high speeds and downhill stability.\n\n===Suspension===\n[[File:Full suspension mountain bike.jpg|thumb|A full suspension mountain bike]]\n\n{{main|Bicycle suspension}}\n\nIn the past mountain bikes had a rigid frame and fork. In the early 1990s, the first mountain bikes with suspension forks were introduced. This made riding on rough terrain easier and less physically stressful. The first front suspension forks had about 1\u00bd to 2&nbsp;inches (38 to 50&nbsp;mm) of suspension travel. Once suspension was introduced, bikes with front suspension and rigid, non-suspended rear wheels, or \"hardtails\", became popular nearly overnight. While the hardtail design has the benefits of lower cost, less maintenance, and better pedaling efficiency, it is slowly losing popularity due to improvements in full suspension designs. Front fork suspensions are now available with {{convert|8|in|mm}} of travel or more (see above under \"Design.\")\n\nMany new mountain bikes integrate a \"full suspension\" design known as Dual Suspension, meaning that both the front and rear wheel are fitted with a shock absorber in some form as the wheel attaches to the bike. This provides a smoother ride as the front and rear wheels can now travel up and down to absorb the force of obstacles striking the tires. Dual suspension bikes of a similar quality are considerably more expensive, but this price increase brings an enormous off-road performance upgrade as dual suspension bikes are much faster on downhill and technical/rough sections, than other forms of the mountain bike. This is because when the wheel strikes an obstacle its tendency is to bounce up. Due to some forward energy being lost in the upward movement some speed is lost. Dual Suspension bikes solve this problem by absorbing this upward force and transmit it into the shocks of the front and rear wheels, drastically decreasing the translation of forward momentum into useless upward movement. Disadvantages of rear suspension are increased weight, increased price, and with some designs, decreased pedaling efficiency, which is especially noticeable when cycling on roads and hard trails. At first, early rear suspension designs were overly heavy, and susceptible either to pedaling-induced bobbing or lockout.\n\n===Disc brakes===\n[[File:BrakeDiskVR.JPG|thumb|A front disc brake, mounted to the fork and hub]]\n{{about||further information see|Bicycle brake#Disc brakes|general information|Disc brake}}\n\nMost new mountain bikes use disc brakes. They offer much improved stopping power (less lever pressure is required providing greater braking modulation) over rim brakes under all conditions especially adverse conditions, because they are located at the center of the wheel (on the wheel hub).  They therefore remain drier and cleaner than wheel rims, which are more readily soiled or damaged.  The disadvantage of disc brakes is their increased cost and often greater weight. Disc brakes do not allow heat to build up in the tires on long descents; instead, heat builds up in the rotor, which can become extremely hot.\n\n==Wheel and tire design==\nTypical features of a mountain bike are wide knobby tires. The original 26 inch [[bicycle wheel|wheel]] diameter with ~2.125\" width ([[ISO 5775#Rims|ISO]] 559&nbsp;mm rim diameter) is increasingly being displaced by 29 inch wheels with ~2.35\" width (ISO 622&nbsp;mm rim diameter), as well as the 27.5 inch wheel diameter with ~2.25 widths (ISO 584&nbsp;mm rim diameter). Mountain bikes with 24 inch wheels are also available, sometimes for dirt jumping, or as a junior bike.<ref name=\"brown\"/>\n\nBicycle wheel sizes are not precise measurements: a 29-inch mountain bike wheel with a {{convert|622|mm|inch}} bead seat diameter (the term, bead seat diameter (BSD), is used in the [[ETRTO]] tire and rim sizing system), and the average 29\" mountain bike tire is (in ISO notation) 59-622 corresponds to an outside diameter of about 29.15 inches (740&nbsp;mm).<ref name=\"brown\"/>\n\n622&nbsp;mm wheels are standard on road bikes and are commonly known as 700C. In some countries, mainly in [[Continental Europe]], 700C (622&nbsp;mm) wheels are commonly called 28&nbsp;inch wheels.<ref name=\"brown\">{{cite web\n|url = http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tire-sizing.html\n|title = Sheldon Brown: Tire Sizing Systems\n|accessdate = 2008-09-21}}</ref> 24&nbsp;inch wheels are used for dirt jumping bikes and sometimes on freeride bikes, rear wheel only, as this makes the bike more maneuverable. 29&nbsp;inch wheels were once used for only Cross Country purposes, but are now becoming more commonplace in other disciplines of mountain biking. A mountain bike with 29\" wheels is often referred to as a [[29er (bicycle)|29er]], and a bike with 27.5 inch wheels is called a [[27.5 Mountain bike|27.5 mountain bike]] or as a marketing term \u2033650B bike\u2033.<ref name=\"brown\"/>\n\nWheels come in a variety of widths, ranging from standard [[Bicycle wheel#Rim|rims]] suitable for use with tires in the 1.90 to 2.10 [[Inch|in]] (48 to 53&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]]) size, to {{convert|2.35|and|3.00|in|mm|abbr=on}} widths popular with freeride and downhill bicycles. Although heavier wheelsets are favored in the freeride and downhill disciplines, advances in wheel technology continually shave weight off strong wheels. This is highly advantageous as rolling weight greatly affects handling and control, which are very important to the technical nature of freeride and downhill riding.\n[[File:15-07-19-Fahrradcorso-RalfR-DSCF6576 1.jpg|thumb|A [[Fatbike|fat tire bicycle]]]]\nThe widest wheel/tire widths, typically 3.8 in (97&nbsp;mm) or larger, are sometimes used by [[icebiking|icebikers]] who use their mountain bikes for winter-time riding in snowy conditions.\n\nManufacturers produce [[bicycle tire]]s with a wide variety of tread patterns to suit different needs. Among these styles are: slick street tires, street tires with a center ridge and outer tread, fully knobby, front-specific, rear-specific, and snow studded. Some tires can be specifically designed for use in certain weather (wet or dry) and terrain (hard, soft, muddy, etc.) conditions. Other tire designs attempt to be all-around applicable. Within the same intended application, more expensive tires tend to be lighter and have less rolling resistance. Sticky Rubber tires are now available for use on freeride and downhill bikes. While these tires wear down more quickly, they provide greater traction in all conditions, especially during cornering. Tires and rims are available in either tubed or tubeless designs, with [[tubeless tire]]s recently (2004) gaining favor for their pinch flat resistance.\n\nTires also come with tubes, tubeless and tubeless-ready.  Tires with tubes are the standard design and the easiest to use and maintain.  Tubeless tires often have better performance because you can run them at a lower tire pressure which results in better traction and increasing rolling resistance.  Tubeless-ready tires are tires that can use tubes or go tubeless.  A liquid sealant is used without the tube to secure the seal to the rim.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Dan|author2=Charlie Layton|title=Know Your Rubber|journal=Mountain Bike|date=May 2009|page=51}}</ref>  Popular tire manufacturers include [[Wilderness Trail Bikes]], Schwalbe, Maxxis, Nokian, Michelin, Continental, Tioga, Kenda, Hutchinson Specialized and Panaracer.\n\n==Tandems==\n[[File:Tandem VTT doublettrack Tthunder.jpg|thumb|right|A tandem, full-suspension mountain bike]]\nMountain bikes are available in [[tandem bicycle|tandem]] configurations. For example, [[Cannondale Bicycle Corporation|Cannondale]] and [[Santana Cycles]] offer ones without suspension, while [[Ellsworth Handcrafted Bicycles|Ellsworth]], Nicolai, and Ventana manufacture tandems with full suspension.\n\n==See also==\n<!-- if you add something here it has to be notable, otherwise it will be removed.
