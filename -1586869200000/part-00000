Marston was intensely happy for a time in the affection of [[Mary Nesbit]]. \nThe death of his betrothed from rapid [[Tuberculosis|consumption]], in November 1871, devastated him, and was the precursor of a series of calamities which may have produced the morbid element in his views of life and nature.{{sfn|Garnett|1893}}\n\nIn 1874, a friend, [[Oliver Madox Brown]], died suddenly. In 1878 Marston lost with equal suddenness of his beloved sister Cicely, to whom one of his most beautiful poems is addressed. \nHis surviving sister, Eleanor, died early in the following year; her husband, [[Arthur O'Shaughnessy]], followed shortly. \nIn 1882, the death of Marston's chief poetic ally and inspirer, [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], was followed closely by that of another kindred spirit, [[James Thomson (B.V.)|James Thomson]],{{sfn|Garnett|1893}} who was carried dying from his blind friend's rooms, where he had sought refuge from his latest miseries early in June of the same year.\n\nMarston's poetry became sorrowful and melancholy. The idylls of flower-life, such as the early ''The Rose and the Wind'', were succeeded by dreams of sleep and the repose of death. These qualities and gradations of feeling are traceable through his three published collections, ''Songtide'' (1871), ''All in All'' (1873) and ''Wind Voices'' (1883). Marston's poetry was collected in 1892 by [[Louise Chandler Moulton]], a loyal friend, and herself a poet.\n\nIn his later years Marston wrote short stories for ''[[Home Chimes]]'', as well as American magazines, through the agency of Mrs. Chandler Moulton. His popularity in America far exceeded that in his own country.\n\nThe three volumes of poetry published in his lifetime, ''Song-Tide and other Poems'' (1871), ''All in All'' (1875), and ''Wind Voices'' (1883), abound with beautiful thoughts expressed in beautiful language. \nHis short stories were collected by Mr. Sharp under the title of ''For a Song's Sake and other Stories'' (1887, 8vo).{{sfn|Garnett|1893}}\n\n==Literature==\n* [[Coulson Kernahan]], in ''Sorrow and Song'' (Philadelphia, 1894)  \n* [[William Sharp (writer)|William Sharp]], in ''Papers Critical and Reminiscent'' (New York, 1912)\n\n==References==\n{{wikisource author}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n*{{DNB|wstitle=Marston, Philip Bourke |first=Richard|last=Garnett|volume=36}}\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Marston, Philip Bourke}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Philip Bourke Marston}}\n* {{Librivox author |id=4633}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Marston, Philip Bourke}}\n[[Category:English poets]]\n[[Category:1850 births]]\n[[Category:1887 deaths]]\n[[Category:Writers from London]]\n[[Category:English male poets]]\n[[Category:19th-century English poets]]\n[[Category:19th-century British male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{More footnotes|date=March 2012}}\n'''Philip Bourke Marston''' (13 August 1850 \u2013 13 February 1887) was an English poet.\n\n==Life==\nHe was the son of [[John Westland Marston]].\nHe was born in London 13 August 1850. \nPhilip James Bailey and Dinah Maria Mulock were his sponsors, and the most popular of the latter's short poems, \"Philip, my King,\" is addressed to him. \nAt age three, Marston partially lost his vision due to the injudicious administration of [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]] (as a prophylactic against [[scarlet fever]]), potentially aggravated by an accidental blow. \nFor many years he maintained enough vision to see, in his own words, \"the tree-boughs waving in the wind, the pageant of sunset in the west, and the glimmer of a fire upon the hearth;\" and this dim, imperfect perception may have been more stimulating to his imagination than either perfect sight or total blindness.{{sfn|Garnett|1893}}\n\nHe indulged, like [[Hartley Coleridge]], in a consecutive series of imaginary adventures and in the reveries called up by music, for which he exhibited the usual fondness of the blind. \nHis skills in verbal expression and melody were soon manifested in poems of remarkable merit for his years, and displaying a power of delineating the aspects of nature which, his affliction considered, seemed almost incomprehensible. \nThese efforts met full recognition from the brilliant literary circle then gathered around his father.

The [[population density]] was 1,029.2 people per square mile (397.3/km\u00b2). There were 2,565 housing units at an average density of 365.4 per square mile (141.1/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 66.65% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 25.12% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.78% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.39% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.11% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 5.08% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.87% from two or more races.

The average household size was 3.07 and the average family size was 3.38.\n\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 35.5% under the age of 18, 8.6% from 18 to 24, 37.2% from 25 to 44, 15.0% from 45 to 64, and 3.7% who were 65 years of age or older.

The only people that get variance's are Big Corporations that are beginning to dominate the city with huge homes and small lots. The zoning commission will approve the big corporation wants, yet will deny a small variance to a young couple who wants to build in the City. The City Manager basically makes the sale for the big corporations, yet will do nothing for the citizens. The City Manager has also screamed and yelled at a citizen like a child having a tantrum; calling him a \"liar\", \"don't point at me\". When the citizen gave him a paper, the continued with the tantrum, violently throwing it into the trash can screaming and interrupting another speaker yelling \"I don't care\". The Demographics are changing because the City council is wanting more money. The percentage of tax may have gone down, but the Huge homes being built on small lots are falsely increasing the value of the properties. Giving the council more hard earned money to waste. The Cities Police and Fire fighters Associations (Scab Unions) unfairly dominate the political landscape getting the council members who will vote them pay raises and new facilities, thinking of themselves and not the people of Glenn Heights. This is a very volatile little community. The City Council and City Manager delete comments and reviews from the city website to prevent so many citizens that put honest statements that are derogatory towards the city manager and council.\n\n==Education==\nThe Dallas County portion of Glenn Heights is served by the [[DeSoto Independent School District]], while the Ellis County portion is served by the [[Red Oak Independent School District]].\n\nThe Dallas County portion is zoned to either Frank D.

Shields Elementary School, Red Oak Intermediate School, Red Oak Junior High School, and [[Red Oak High School (Texas)|Red Oak High School]].\n\n==Transportation==\nGlenn Heights is the only suburb (except for [[Cockrell Hill, Texas|Cockrell Hill]], which is technically an [[enclave]] and not a suburb) in the southern half of Dallas County that is a member of [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]]; it has been since DART's inception in 1983.

The [[population density]] was 1,029.2 people per square mile (397.3/km\u00b2). There were 2,565 housing units at an average density of 365.4 per square mile (141.1/km\u00b2). The racial makeup of the city was 66.65% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 25.12% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.78% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.39% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.11% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 5.08% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.87% from two or more races.

The only people that get variance's are Big Corporations that are beginning to dominate the city with huge homes and small lots. The zoning commission will approve the big corporation wants, yet will deny a small variance to a young couple who wants to build in the City. The City Manager basically makes the sale for the big corporations, yet will do nothing for the citizens. The City Manager has also screamed and yelled at a citizen like a child having a tantrum; calling him a \"liar\", \"don't point at me\". When the citizen gave him a paper, the continued with the tantrum, violently throwing it into the trash can screaming and interrupting another speaker yelling \"I don't care\". The Demographics are changing because the City council is wanting more money. The percentage of tax may have gone down, but the Huge homes being built on small lots are falsely increasing the value of the the properties. Giving the council more hard earned money to waste. The Cities Police and Fire fighters Associations (Scab Unions) unfairly dominate the political landscape getting the council members who will vote them pay raises and new facilities, thinking of themselves and not the people of Glenn Heights. This is a very volatile little community. The City Council and City Manager delete comments and reviews from the city website to prevent so many citizens that put honest statements that are derogatory towards the city manager and council.\n\n==Education==\nThe Dallas County portion of Glenn Heights is served by the [[DeSoto Independent School District]], while the Ellis County portion is served by the [[Red Oak Independent School District]].\n\nThe Dallas County portion is zoned to either Frank D.

The locomotives were built in [[Schenectady, New York]], in the [[United States]] by a partnership of the [[American Locomotive Company]] (ALCO) and [[General Electric]] (GE) between June 1946 and December 1953. They were of a [[cab unit]] design, and both cab-equipped lead [[A unit]] '''PA''' and cabless booster [[B unit]] '''PB''' models were built.\n\nExternally, the PA and PB models looked very similar to the [[ALCO FA]] models produced in the same period.  Both the PA and FA models were styled by General Electric's Ray Patten. They shared many of the same characteristics both aesthetically and mechanically.  It was the locomotive's mechanical qualities (the [[ALCO 244]] [[V16 engine|V-16]] prime mover) and newer locomotive models from both [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) and [[General Electric]] (the partnership with ALCO was dissolved in 1953) that ultimately led to the retirement of the PA/PB locomotive model from revenue service.  Six examples of PAs and PBs have been preserved in railroad museums.\n\nALCO's designation of P indicates that they were geared for higher speeds and passenger use, whereas the F designation marks these locomotives as being geared primarily for freight use. However, beyond this their design was largely similar - aside from the PA/PB's both being larger A1A-A1A types with an even more striking nose - and many railroads used FA and PA locomotives for both freight and passenger service.\n\n==Background and development==\nThe PAs, as well as their cousins, the [[ALCO FA]]s, were born as a result of Alco's development of a new diesel engine design, the Model 244.  In early 1944, development started on the new design, and by November 1945, the first engines were beginning to undergo tests.  This unusually short testing sequence was brought about by the decision of Alco's senior management that the engine and an associated line of road locomotives had to be introduced no later than the end of 1946.\n\nIn preparation for this deadline, by January 1946, the first 16-cylinder 244 engines were being tested, and while a strike delayed work on the locomotives, the first two PA units were released for road tests in June 1946, for testing for one month on the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]]. After these first tests were completed, the locomotives returned to the factory for refurbishment and engine replacement.\n\nIn September 1946, the first production units, an A-B-A set of PA1s in [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] colors, were released from the factory, and sent to New York's [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], which had a private railroad siding, for exhibition before being launched into road service.<ref name=\"Alco\">{{cite book|last=Steinbrenner|first=Richard T|title=The American Locomotive Company: A Centennial Remembrance|year=2003|publisher=On Track Publishers|isbn=0-911122-07-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nTwo models were offered: the {{convert|2000|hp}} '''PA-1'''/'''PB-1''' (built between September, 1946 and June, 1950); the {{convert|2250|hp}} '''PA-2'''/'''PB-2''' (built between April, 1950 and December, 1953)\n\nModels popularly termed the '''PA-3'''/'''PB-3''' were in fact only an upgrade of the '''PA-2'''/'''PB-2'''. The true '''PA-3'''/'''PB-3''' model would have boasted {{convert|2400|hp}}, though none were ever built. Aside from the small power increase between the PA-1 and the PA-2, differences were minor. Externally PA-2s could be distinguished by the absence of the \"eyebrow\" trim piece on the grille behind the cab and the porthole window behind the radiator shutters. Internally, later PA-2 and PB-2 production featured a water-cooled turbocharger and other engine compartment changes, but these were frequently added to older models undergoing major repairs or overhauls. Four PA-1s were upgraded by Morrison-Knudsen in 1974-75 for passenger service on the Delaware & Hudson and became the PA4.<ref>See Anderson, Norman E. and MacDermott, C. G., \"PA4 Locomotive.\" (Burlingame, Chatham Publishing Co.)(1978). {{ISBN|0896850358}}.</ref> These were eventually used by Amtrak for the \"Adirondack\" train and then by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority]] before being sold to Mexico.\n\n[[Image:D-H18.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The cab and nose design profile of D&H Alco PA4 No. 18, returning from [[Morrison-Knudsen]] rebuild in 1975, as compared to that of an [[Amtrak]] [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] [[EMD F-unit|F unit]].]]\n[[File:Santa Fe ALCO PA-1 1946.JPG|thumb|Publicity photo of an ALCO PA-1 ABA set of the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railway]] in September, 1946.]]\n\nLike its smaller cousin, the [[ALCO FA]], the PA had distinctive styling, with a long, straight flat-tipped nose with a headlight in a square, slitted grille, raked windshields, and trim pieces behind the cab windows that lengthened and sleekened the lines. The overall design owed something to the [[Fairbanks-Morse]] [[FM Erie-built|Erie-built]] design, which had been constructed by ALCO's electrical equipment partner [[General Electric]] at their [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] plant. The majority of PA components were compatible with the FA.\n\nFans deemed the PA one of the most beautiful diesels and an \"Honorary Steam Locomotive\", as noted by Professor [[George Hilton (historian)|George W. Hilton]] in a book review in September, 1968 ''[[Trains Magazine]]''. When accelerating, until the turbocharger came up to speed thick clouds of black smoke would pour from the exhaust stacks, due to [[turbo lag]]. Photographing a moving PA while smoking became a prime objective of [[railfans]]<ref>Ingles, J.

The later [[ALCO 251|251]]-series engine, a vastly improved prime mover, was not available in time for ALCO to recover the loss of reputation caused by the unreliability of the [[ALCO 244|244]], which was a key factor in the dissolution of the partnership with GE. By the time the [[ALCO 251]] engine was accepted into widespread use, General Electric had launched their own entries into the diesel-electric locomotive market, notably the [[GE U25B|U25B]].

In 1974-1975, these four units were rebuilt for the D&H by [[Washington Group International|Morrison-Knudsen]] and equipped with ALCO's 251V12 engines. During this rebuilding the units were given the designation '''PA-4''' by MK. These locomotives were later sold to Mexico. Of the D&H units, two are in the United States, [[Delaware & Hudson 16|No.16]] and No.18. These units returned to the U.S. in 2000 after years of storage at [[Empalme, Sonora|Empalme]], [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]]. \n**No.16, which was heavily damaged in a derailment while in Mexico, was planned to be cosmetically restored into its original \"[[Warbonnet (paint scheme)|Warbonnet]]\" colors for the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The unit was acquired by the [[Museum of the American Railroad]] and transported to the museum's new site in Frisco, Texas in April 2011. This unit will be restored to full operational status as [http://www.pa59.org America's PA] for use in special trains across the United States.<ref>http://www.pa59.org</ref>\n**No.18 is owned by [[Doyle McCormack]] and currently undergoing restoration at the [[Oregon Rail Heritage Center]], in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Although of ATSF heritage, it is being restored as [[Nickel Plate Road 190]], a recreation of the first locomotive McCormack got to ride.<ref>https://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2019/03/21-mccormack-retires-as-oregon-rail-heritage-foundation-president</ref>\n**No.19 is kept in operational condition at the National Museum of Mexican Railroad in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], while No.17 remains on display in the museum. Unit DH-17 (former D&H #17) was painted in the classic [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] [[Coast Daylight (SP)|Daylight]] colors, but as of February 2010 had been painted over in primer.\n*Ex-Denver and Rio Grande PB-1 6002 was converted to a steam generator car in October 1965; it later gained Blomberg B trucks in 1980. It was sold to Ansco in late 1987 for service on the [[Ski Train]], and later sold again in 2007 to the [[Algoma Central Railway]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Aslaksen, James and McCormack, Doyle.

The locomotives were built in [[Schenectady, New York]], in the [[United States]] by a partnership of the [[American Locomotive Company]] (ALCO) and [[General Electric]] (GE) between June 1946 and December 1953. They were of a [[cab unit]] design, and both cab-equipped lead [[A unit]] '''PA''' and cabless booster [[B unit]] '''PB''' models were built.\n\nExternally, the PA and PB models looked very similar to the [[ALCO FA]] models produced in the same period.  Both the PA and FA models were styled by General Electric's Ray Patten. They shared many of the same characteristics both aesthetically and mechanically.  It was the locomotive's mechanical qualities (the [[ALCO 244]] [[V16 engine|V-16]] prime mover) and newer locomotive models from both [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) and [[General Electric]] (the partnership with ALCO was dissolved in 1953) that ultimately led to the retirement of the PA/PB locomotive model from revenue service.  Six examples of PAs and PBs have been preserved in railroad museums.\n\nALCO's designation of P indicates that they were geared for higher speeds and passenger use, whereas the F designation marks these locomotives as being geared primarily for freight use. However, beyond this their design was largely similar - aside from the PA/PB's both being larger A1A-A1A types with an even more striking nose - and many railroads used FA and PA locomotives for both freight and passenger service.\n\n==Background and development==\nThe PAs, as well as their cousins, the [[ALCO FA]]s, were born as a result of Alco's development of a new diesel engine design, the Model 244.  In early 1944, development started on the new design, and by November 1945, the first engines were beginning to undergo tests.  This unusually short testing sequence was brought about by the decision of Alco's senior management that the engine and an associated line of road locomotives had to be introduced no later than the end of 1946.\n\nIn preparation for this deadline, by January 1946, the first 16-cylinder 244 engines were being tested, and while a strike delayed work on the locomotives, the first two PA units were released for road tests in June 1946, for testing for one month on the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]]. After these first tests were completed, the locomotives returned to the factory for refurbishment and engine replacement.\n\nIn September 1946, the first production units, an A-B-A set of PA1s in [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe]] colors, were released from the factory, and sent to New York's [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], which had a private railroad siding, for exhibition before being launched into road service.<ref name=\"Alco\">{{cite book|last=Steinbrenner|first=Richard T|title=The American Locomotive Company: A Centennial Remembrance|year=2003|publisher=On Track Publishers|isbn=0-911122-07-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nTwo models were offered: the {{convert|2000|hp}} '''PA-1'''/'''PB-1''' (built between September, 1946 and June, 1950); the {{convert|2250|hp}} '''PA-2'''/'''PB-2''' (built between April, 1950 and December, 1953)\n\nModels popularly termed the '''PA-3'''/'''PB-3''' were in fact only an upgrade of the '''PA-2'''/'''PB-2'''. The true '''PA-3'''/'''PB-3''' model would have boasted {{convert|2400|hp}}, though none were ever built. Aside from the small power increase between the PA-1 and the PA-2, differences were minor. Externally PA-2s could be distinguished by the absence of the \"eyebrow\" trim piece on the grille behind the cab and the porthole window behind the radiator shutters. Internally, later PA-2 and PB-2 production featured a water-cooled turbocharger and other engine compartment changes, but these were frequently added to older models undergoing major repairs or overhauls. Four PA-1s were upgraded by Morrison-Knudsen in 1974-75 for passenger service on the Delaware & Hudson and became the PA4.<ref>See Anderson, Norman E. and MacDermott, C. G., \"PA4 Locomotive.\" (Burlingame, Chatham Publishing Co.)(1978). {{ISBN|0896850358}}.</ref> These were eventually used by Amtrak for the \"Adirondack\" train and then by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority]] before being sold to Mexico.\n\n[[Image:D-H18.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The cab and nose design profile of D&H Alco PA4 No. 18, returning from [[Morrison-Knudsen]] rebuild in 1975, as compared to that of an [[Amtrak]] [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] [[EMD F-unit|F unit]].]]\n[[File:Santa Fe ALCO PA-1 1946.JPG|thumb|Publicity photo of an ALCO PA-1 ABA set of the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railway]] in September, 1946.]]\n\nLike its smaller cousin, the [[ALCO FA]], the PA had distinctive styling, with a long, straight flat-tipped nose with a headlight in a square, slitted grille, raked windshields, and trim pieces behind the cab windows that lengthened and sleekened the lines. The overall design owed something to the [[Fairbanks-Morse]] [[FM Erie-built|Erie-built]] design, which had been constructed by ALCO's electrical equipment partner [[General Electric]] at their [[Erie, Pennsylvania]] plant. The majority of PA components were compatible with the FA.\n\nFans deemed the PA one of the most beautiful diesels and an \"Honorary Steam Locomotive\", as noted by Professor [[George Hilton (historian)|George W. Hilton]] in a book review in September, 1968 ''[[Trains Magazine]]''. When accelerating, until the turbocharger came up to speed thick clouds of black smoke would pour from the exhaust stacks, due to [[turbo lag]].

The later [[ALCO 251|251]]-series engine, a vastly improved prime mover, was not available in time for ALCO to recover the loss of reputation caused by the unreliability of the [[ALCO 244|244]], which was a key factor in the dissolution of the partnership with GE. By the time the [[ALCO 251]] engine was accepted into widespread use, General Electric had launched their own entries into the diesel-electric locomotive market, notably the [[GE U25B|U25B]]. General Electric eventually supplanted ALCO as a manufacturer of locomotives, leading to ALCO's exit from the locomotive market in 1969.\n\nThe original Santa Fe three unit set #51L, 51A and 51B was repowered in August 1954 with EMD 16-567C engines rated at 1,750&nbsp;hp (1,305&nbsp;kW). This EMD repowering of the PAs was economically unfeasible and the remaining Santa Fe PAs retained their 244 engines. \n\n== Original owners ==\n<br>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! bgcolor=#CCCCCC | Railroad\n! bgcolor=#CCCCCC | PA1\n! bgcolor=#CCCCCC | PB1\n! bgcolor=#CCCCCC | PA2\n! bgcolor=#CCCCCC | PB2\n! bgcolor=#CCCCCC | PA1 Road Numbers\n! bgcolor=#CCCCCC | PB1 Road Numbers\n! bgcolor=#CCCCCC | PA2 Road Numbers\n! bgcolor=#CCCCCC | PB2 Road Numbers\n! bgcolor=#CCCCCC class=\"unsortable\"| Notes\n|-\n| ALCO-GE Demonstrators || || || align=right|1 || align=right|1 || || || align=center|8375 || align=center|8375B || to New York Central Railroad 4212 and 4304\n|-\n| ALCO-GE Demonstrators || align=right|2 || || || || align=center|9077-9078 || || || || Demonstrated on Canadian National, painted in CN green and gold, later to Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad as PA-2s 59A,C.

A restoration was begun in 2001 but has not been completed.\n*Four (No.16-19) are of the ex-Santa Fe group of locomotives purchased by the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway|Delaware & Hudson]] in 1967. In 1974-1975, these four units were rebuilt for the D&H by [[Washington Group International|Morrison-Knudsen]] and equipped with ALCO's 251V12 engines. During this rebuilding the units were given the designation '''PA-4''' by MK. These locomotives were later sold to Mexico. Of the D&H units, two are in the United States, [[Delaware & Hudson 16|No.16]] and No.18. These units returned to the U.S. in 2000 after years of storage at [[Empalme, Sonora|Empalme]], [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]]. \n**No.16, which was heavily damaged in a derailment while in Mexico, was planned to be cosmetically restored into its original \"[[Warbonnet (paint scheme)|Warbonnet]]\" colors for the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The unit was acquired by the [[Museum of the American Railroad]] and transported to the museum's new site in Frisco, Texas in April 2011. This unit will be restored to full operational status as [http://www.pa59.org America's PA] for use in special trains across the United States.<ref>http://www.pa59.org</ref>\n**No.18 is owned by [[Doyle McCormack]] and currently undergoing restoration at the [[Oregon Rail Heritage Center]], in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Although of ATSF heritage, it is being restored as [[Nickel Plate Road 190]], a recreation of the the first locomotive McCormack got to ride.<ref>https://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2019/03/21-mccormack-retires-as-oregon-rail-heritage-foundation-president</ref>\n**No.19 is kept in operational condition at the National Museum of Mexican Railroad in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], while No.17 remains on display in the museum. Unit DH-17 (former D&H #17) was painted in the classic [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]] [[Coast Daylight (SP)|Daylight]] colors, but as of February 2010 had been painted over in primer.\n*Ex-Denver and Rio Grande PB-1 6002 was converted to a steam generator car in October 1965; it later gained Blomberg B trucks in 1980. It was sold to Ansco in late 1987 for service on the [[Ski Train]], and later sold again in 2007 to the [[Algoma Central Railway]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Aslaksen, James and McCormack, Doyle.
