It began academic works as a female education institution; in 1962 it acquired its national and joint character.\n\nIt offers 20 undergraduate academic programs and 19 graduate, within which is the only doctorate in education offered in the country, in agreement with the [[University of Valle|Universidad del Valle]] and [[District University of Bogot\u00e1|Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Caldas]].\n\nThe National Pedagogic University has the principal goal of integral teacher training through a coherent educational plan based on the principles underlying its nature and rationale. teach excellence, quality, equity, membership and academic rigor of the training programs and processes in teaching, research and extension. That is because of its slogan \"Educating Educators\". The university has received the high quality institutional accreditation by the Ministry of Education in 2016.\n\n== History ==\nThe university is a chapter in Colombian history linked to the development of education, for their contribution to teacher training in different areas of knowledge and research, production and dissemination of national educational thinking.

They were known in the local dialect as ''''Th' Deighn Layrocks''''.\n\n== Background ==\nDean is a small community within the east Lancashire valley of Rossendale, near [[Water, Lancashire|Water]] between [[Rawtenstall]] and [[Burnley]], part of the area in which the textile industry expanded massively during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In 1835 the Scottish writer [[George Hogarth]] noted 'In the densely populated manufacturing districts&nbsp;... music is cultivated among the working classes to an extent unparalleled in any other part of the country', in his ''Musical History'', referring to the industrialised parts of England. Soon after, in 1862 [[Edwin Waugh]] describing [[Manchester]] in the [[Lancashire Cotton Famine|Cotton Famine]] mentions 'swarms of strange, shy, sad-looking singers and instrumental performers in the work-worn clothing of factory-operatives'.

As in many similar communities [[chapels]] were built throughout Rossendale during the following years. Influenced by the preacher John Nuttall a small [[Baptist]] chapel was built in 1750 and rebuilt later in Goodshaw in 1760. Nuttall was the minister until his death in 1792. Richard Hudson was another preacher working with Nuttall who was responsible for the religious music that was a feature of the worship. Goodshaw Chapel became a magnet for music. The group who called themselves The Larks of Dean carried their instruments over the rough moorland terrain every Sunday to perform in the Chapel. The tradition flourished for a century until the Chapel closed in 1860.<ref name=\"Jean Seymour pp 14-21\">Jean Seymour; article West Gallery no.6 Spring 1994 pp 14\u201321</ref>\n\n== The music ==\nThere are well over a thousand [[psalm]] and [[hymn]] tunes collected together from the Larks of Dean. The earliest dated appears to be 1745, and the Rev. John Nuttall's two sons, James and Henry contributed most, with Henry composing about 100. Other composers were John Hargreaves, Reuben Hudson, Abraham and Robert Ashworth, and other members of the Nuttall family.<ref name=\"Jean Seymour pp 14-21\"/>\n\nThere are many stories of practices going into the early hours, even of Sunday sessions continuing into Monday.

One remarkable member was Robert o' t'h Moss (Ashworth), and Thomas Newbigging tells the story of him playing a hornpipe on his cello; when an old deacon exclaimed \"Robert, that's an idle tune\", he replied, \"There are no idle tunes.\" <ref>A Rossendale Anthology; Ronald Digby 1969, The Forest Press, Bacup - quoting Thomas Newbigging's 'History of Rossendale'</ref>\n\nToday the Larks of Dean Quire, based in [[Bury, Greater Manchester]] continue this tradition, though their singing of hymns, psalms, [[anthems]], and [[carols]], are mostly performed unaccompanied, and they have their own Larks of Dean Quire website [http://www.larksofdean.co.uk/]. A collection of instruments and manuscripts belonging to the original Larks of Dean are on display in Whitaker Park Museum, [[Rawtenstall]].\n\n== \"Wandering Minstrels; or, Wails of the Workless Poor\"==\n\nDean is a small settlement about 3 miles due east of Goodshaw Chapel. The places are not connected by road, rather by several of the countless footpaths that criss-cross the [[moorland]]s of the area. These paths are exposed and high, potentially dangerous in the winter months. The musicians would have walked these paths to reach their place of worship and music-making. [[Edwin Waugh]], in his 'Home-Life of the Lancashire Factory Folk during the Cotton Famine' gives a vivid but historically interesting insight into the lives of the Larks of Dean in the following passage:\n\n\"Up in the forest of Rosendale, between Deerply Moor and the wild hill\ncalled Swinshaw, there is a little lone valley, a green cup in the\nmountains, called \"Dean.\" The inhabitants of this valley are so\nnotable for their love of music, that they are known all through the\nvales of Rosendale as \"Th' Deighn Layrocks,\" or \"The Larks of Dean.\"\n\n\"In the twilight of a glorious Sunday evening, in the height of\nsummer, I was roaming over the heathery waste of Swinshaw, towards\nDean, in company with a musical friend of mine, who lived in the\nneighbouring clough, when we saw a little crowd of people coming\ndown a moorland slope, far away in front of us. As they drew nearer,\nwe found that many of them had musical instruments, and when we met,\nmy friend recognised them as working people living in the district,\nand mostly well known to him. He inquired where they had been; and\nthey told him that they had \"bin to a bit ov a sing deawn i'th\nDeighn.\" \"Well,\" said he, \"can't we have a tune here?\" \"Sure, yo\ncon, wi' o' th' plezzur i'th world,\" replied he who acted as\nspokesman; and a low buzz of delighted consent ran through the rest\nof the company.

In 2000, he starred as [[Dracula in popular culture|Dracula]] in the horror film ''[[Dracula 2000]]'' with [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Jonny Lee Miller]].\n\nHe subsequently played [[Attila|Attila the Hun]] in the miniseries ''[[Attila (miniseries)|Attila]]'' (2001) and then appeared in the films ''[[Reign of Fire (film)|Reign of Fire]]'' with [[Christian Bale]] (2002) and ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider \u2013 The Cradle of Life]]'' with [[Angelina Jolie]] (2003), before playing Andr\u00e9 Marek in the adaptation of [[Michael Crichton]]'s science fiction adventure ''[[Timeline (2003 film)|Timeline]]'' (2003). He then was cast as the role of [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik, The Phantom]] in [[Joel Schumacher]]'s 2004 film adaptation of the musical ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' alongside [[Emmy Rossum]]. That role earned him a [[Satellite Award]] nomination for [[Satellite Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Actor]].\n\nButler gained worldwide recognition for his portrayal of [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]] in [[Zack Snyder]]'s fantasy war film ''[[300 (film)|300]]''. That role earned him nominations for an [[Empire Award for Best Actor]] and a [[Saturn Award for Best Actor]] and a win for [[MTV Movie Award for Best Fight]]. In the 2010s, he voiced the role of Stoick the Vast in the animated action-fantasy film ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'', a role he later reprised in ''[[Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon]]'' (2010), ''[[Gift of the Night Fury]]'' (2011), ''[[How to Train Your Dragon 2]]'' (2014), and ''[[How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World]]'' (2019). Also in the 2010s, he portrayed Secret Service agent Mike Banning in the action thriller trilogy ''[[Olympus Has Fallen]]'', ''[[London Has Fallen]]'', and ''[[Angel Has Fallen]]''. He played military leader [[Attius Tullius|Tullus Aufidius]] in the 2011 film ''[[Coriolanus (2011 film)|Coriolanus]]'', a modernized adaptation of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Coriolanus|tragedy of the same name]].

He mostly lived in [[Venice Beach]], working at different jobs, travelling often, and, according to him, drinking heavily, at one point being arrested for alcohol-related disorderly conduct. Butler later described this year as, \"I was out of control, and justifying it with this idea that 'I'm young, this is life. This is me just being boisterous.\" After his time off in America, he returned to Scotland to take his final year at law school.<ref name=esq/>\nButler had an ear surgery when he was a child that left him with a mangled ear.

However, he continued to stay out late drinking and he frequently missed work because of this. One week before he qualified as a lawyer, he was fired. At the age of 25, and an unqualified lawyer, Butler moved to London to pursue his dream of becoming famous. He admitted, \"When I started out, I'm not sure I was actually in it for the right reasons. I wanted very much to be famous.\"<ref name=\"telegraph\" />\n\nUnable to win any acting roles initially, he worked in a variety of jobs including as a waiter, a telemarketer and a demonstrator of how toys work at fairs. Whilst in London, he met an old friend from his teenage days in the Scottish Youth Theatre, who was now a London casting director. At that time, he was her boyfriend and her assistant. She took him to an audition for [[Steven Berkoff]]'s play of ''[[Coriolanus]]''.<ref name=\"paisley\" /> The director said of Butler's audition, \"When he read, he had such vigour and enthusiasm\u2014so much that it made the other actors seem limp\u2014that I decided to cast him in the ensemble.\"<ref name=\"telegraph_a\" />\n\nThen aged 27, Butler had his first professional acting job. Less than a year later, he won a part in a theatre adaptation of ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'', which he performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. At age 30, Butler decided to move to Los Angeles; there he won parts in ''[[Dracula 2000]]'', ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life|Tomb Raider 2]]'', ''[[Dear Frankie]]'', and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]''.<ref name=\"telegraph_a\" />\n\n===Acting career===\nIn [[London]], Butler held a series of odd jobs until being cast by actor and director [[Steven Berkoff]] (who later appeared alongside him in ''[[Attila (TV miniseries)|Attila]]'' (2001)) in a stage production of ''[[Coriolanus]]''. He was cast as [[Ewan McGregor]]'s character Renton in the stage adaptation of ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', the same play that had inspired him to become an actor.<ref name=\"film\"/> His film debut was as [[Billy Connolly]]'s character's younger brother in ''[[Mrs Brown]]'' (1997).<ref>{{cite web|title=Mrs Brown|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0078lkb|publisher=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nHis film career continued with small roles, first in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997)<ref name=\"film\">{{cite web|title=Gerard Butler Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/gerard-butler-20808745|publisher=biography.com|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref> and then [[Russell Mulcahy]]'s ''[[Tale of the Mummy]]'' (1998). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being Attila the Hun in the American TV miniseries ''[[Attila (TV miniseries)|Attila]]'' (2001). The film's producers wanted a known actor to play the part but eventually chose Butler.<ref>{{cite web|title=Attila: hot babes, baths and, erm, birth control|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/28/reel-history-attila-gerard-butler|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 February 2015|date=28 January 2010}}</ref> He was cast as Dracula in ''[[Dracula 2000]]'' (2000).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Graph Of Manliness: Gerard Butle|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/graph-of-manliness-gerard-butler/|publisher=empireonline.com|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gerard Butler IMG 4383.JPG|thumb|upright|Butler at the 2012 [[Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]]]\n\nHe then appeared in ''[[Reign of Fire (film)|Reign of Fire]]'' (2002)<ref>{{cite web|title=Reign of Fire|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/i560848-8/gerard-butler-career-in-pictures-reign-of-fire.html|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref> as Creedy and ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider \u2013 The Cradle of Life]]'' (2003) as Terry Sheridan, alongside [[Angelina Jolie]].

After studying law, Butler turned to acting in the mid-1990s with small roles in productions such as ''[[Mrs Brown]]'' (1997), the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997), and ''[[Tale of the Mummy]]'' (1998). In 2000, he starred as [[Dracula in popular culture|Dracula]] in the horror film ''[[Dracula 2000]]'' with [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Jonny Lee Miller]].\n\nHe subsequently played [[Attila|Attila the Hun]] in the miniseries ''[[Attila (miniseries)|Attila]]'' (2001) and then appeared in the films ''[[Reign of Fire (film)|Reign of Fire]]'' with [[Christian Bale]] (2002) and ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider \u2013 The Cradle of Life]]'' with [[Angelina Jolie]] (2003), before playing Andr\u00e9 Marek in the adaptation of [[Michael Crichton]]'s science fiction adventure ''[[Timeline (2003 film)|Timeline]]'' (2003). He then was cast as the role of [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik, The Phantom]] in [[Joel Schumacher]]'s 2004 film adaptation of the musical ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' alongside [[Emmy Rossum]]. That role earned him a [[Satellite Award]] nomination for [[Satellite Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture|Best Actor]].\n\nButler gained worldwide recognition for his portrayal of [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]] in [[Zack Snyder]]'s fantasy war film ''[[300 (film)|300]]''. That role earned him nominations for an [[Empire Award for Best Actor]] and a [[Saturn Award for Best Actor]] and a win for [[MTV Movie Award for Best Fight]]. In the 2010s, he voiced the role of Stoick the Vast in the animated action-fantasy film ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'', a role he later reprised in ''[[Legend of the Boneknapper Dragon]]'' (2010), ''[[Gift of the Night Fury]]'' (2011), ''[[How to Train Your Dragon 2]]'' (2014), and ''[[How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World]]'' (2019). Also in the 2010s, he portrayed Secret Service agent Mike Banning in the action thriller trilogy ''[[Olympus Has Fallen]]'', ''[[London Has Fallen]]'', and ''[[Angel Has Fallen]]''. He played military leader [[Attius Tullius|Tullus Aufidius]] in the 2011 film ''[[Coriolanus (2011 film)|Coriolanus]]'', a modernized adaptation of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Coriolanus|tragedy of the same name]]. He also played [[Sam Childers]] in the 2011 action biopic ''[[Machine Gun Preacher]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nGerard James Butler<ref name=filmref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/73/Gerard-Butler.html|title=Gerard Butler Biography (1969-)| publisher=FilmReference.com|accessdate=7 August 2016|archivedate=4 March 2016| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100828/http://www.filmreference.com/film/73/Gerard-Butler.html| url-status=live}}</ref><!--cited source, FilmReference.com, also verifies middle name James--> was born on 13 November 1969 in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]],<ref name=esq>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/gerard-butler-interview-0809-2|title=300 Things We Didn't Know About Gerard Butler|publisher=Esquire.com|date=13 June 2009|accessdate=9 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330201934/http://www.esquire.com/features/gerard-butler-interview-0809-2|archivedate=30 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Scotland, the youngest of three children of Margaret and Edward Butler, a [[bookmaker]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Fox |first=Chloe |title=Gerard Butler interview for The Ugly Truth |work=The Daily Telegraph|date=20 July 2009 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/5836476/Gerard-Butler-interview-for-The-Ugly-Truth.html |accessdate=16 November 2010 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrathofgods.com/gerard-butler-interview/|title=Gerard Butler in Wrath Of Gods|date=15 March 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://my.cineplex.com/showbiz-news/2010/03/drawn-together-gerard-butler-craig-ferguson/ |title=Drawn Together: Gerard Butler & Craig Ferguson |publisher=Cineplex Movie Blog |date=15 March 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323014638/http://my.cineplex.com/showbiz-news/2010/03/drawn-together-gerard-butler-craig-ferguson/ |archivedate=23 March 2010  }}</ref> He is from a [[Catholic]] family of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJJmoYp_2tw |title=Gerard Butler Apologises for Irish Accent |publisher=YouTube |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Gerard Butler: \u2018Why I am still single\u2019|url=http://www.no1magazine.co.uk/interviews/60_gerardbutler.html|accessdate=25 February 2015|publisher=Now Magazine|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330034813/http://www.no1magazine.co.uk/interviews/60_gerardbutler.html|archivedate=30 March 2015}}</ref> Butler's family moved to [[Montreal]], Quebec, when he was six months old.<ref>Daily News. \"[http://www.dailynews.com/celebrities/ci_12901408 Gerard Butler breaks the mold] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304143137/http://www.dailynews.com/celebrities/ci_12901408 |date=4 March 2010 }}\"</ref> When his parents' marriage broke down, his mother left Quebec and returned to Scotland with baby Gerard aged 18 months.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/5836476/Gerard-Butler-interview-for-The-Ugly-Truth.htm |title=Gerard Butler interview for The Ugly Truth |first=Chloe |last=Fox |work=Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=20 July 2009 |archivedate=4 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304140942/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/5836476/Gerard-Butler-interview-for-The-Ugly-Truth.html}}</ref>\n\nButler was head boy at [[St Mirin's Academy|St Mirin's & St Margaret's High School]] in Paisley and won a place at [[University of Glasgow School of Law]].<ref name=dailyrecord>{{cite news|last=Stewart|first=Stephen|title=Gerard Butler's school pal on how Hollywood star phoned to grovel after branding her a flirt on TV |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/gerard-butlers-school-pal-on-how-1054405 |accessdate=1 February 2013|newspaper=Daily Record|date=28 March 2010}}</ref><ref name=mensjournal>{{cite news|last=Hedegaard|first=Erik|title=Gerry the Sinner, Gerry the Saint|url=http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/gerry-the-sinner-gerry-the-saint-gerard-butler-20121031?page=3|accessdate=1 February 2013|newspaper=Men's Journal|date=April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720025300/http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/gerry-the-sinner-gerry-the-saint-gerard-butler-20121031?page=3|archivedate=20 July 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also attended [[Scottish Youth Theatre]] while a teenager.

He mostly lived in [[Venice Beach]], working at different jobs, travelling often, and, according to him, drinking heavily, at one point being arrested for alcohol-related disorderly conduct. Butler later described this year as, \"I was out of control, and justifying it with this idea that 'I'm young, this is life. This is me just being boisterous.\" After his time off in America, he returned to Scotland to take his final year at law school.<ref name=esq/>\nButler had an ear surgery when he was a child that left him with a mangled ear.

However, he continued to stay out late drinking and he frequently missed work because of this. One week before he qualified as a lawyer, he was fired. At the age of 25, and an unqualified lawyer, Butler moved to London to pursue his dream of becoming famous. He admitted, \"When I started out, I'm not sure I was actually in it for the right reasons. I wanted very much to be famous.\"<ref name=\"telegraph\" />\n\nUnable to win any acting roles initially, he worked in a variety of jobs including as a waiter, a telemarketer and a demonstrator of how toys work at fairs. Whilst in London, he met an old friend from his teenage days in the Scottish Youth Theatre, who was now a London casting director. At that time, he was her boyfriend and her assistant. She took him to an audition for [[Steven Berkoff]]'s play of ''[[Coriolanus]]''.<ref name=\"paisley\" /> The director said of Butler's audition, \"When he read, he had such vigour and enthusiasm\u2014so much that it made the other actors seem limp\u2014that I decided to cast him in the ensemble.\"<ref name=\"telegraph_a\" />\n\nThen aged 27, Butler had his first professional acting job. Less than a year later, he won a part in a theatre adaptation of ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'', which he performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. At age 30, Butler decided to move to Los Angeles; there he won parts in ''[[Dracula 2000]]'', ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life|Tomb Raider 2]]'', ''[[Dear Frankie]]'', and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (2004 film)|Phantom of the Opera]]''.<ref name=\"telegraph_a\" />\n\n===Acting career===\nIn [[London]], Butler held a series of odd jobs until being cast by actor and director [[Steven Berkoff]] (who later appeared alongside him in ''[[Attila (TV miniseries)|Attila]]'' (2001)) in a stage production of ''[[Coriolanus]]''. He was cast as [[Ewan McGregor]]'s character Renton in the stage adaptation of ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', the same play that had inspired him to become an actor.<ref name=\"film\"/> His film debut was as [[Billy Connolly]]'s character's younger brother in ''[[Mrs Brown]]'' (1997).<ref>{{cite web|title=Mrs Brown|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0078lkb|publisher=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nHis film career continued with small roles, first in the [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] film ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'' (1997)<ref name=\"film\">{{cite web|title=Gerard Butler Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/gerard-butler-20808745|publisher=biography.com|accessdate=25 February 2015}}</ref> and then [[Russell Mulcahy]]'s ''[[Tale of the Mummy]]'' (1998). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being Attila the Hun in the American TV miniseries ''[[Attila (TV miniseries)|Attila]]'' (2001).
