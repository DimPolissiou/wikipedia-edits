After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040606160402/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |url-status = dead|archive-date=6 June 2004 |title=Second boost as Arbroath harbour back on the map |accessdate=30 January 2007 |date=4 March 2004 |work=The Courier and Advertiser |publisher=D.C Thompson |df= }}</ref> There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from [[Aberdeen]] and ports further north.

After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat.<ref name='defra1'>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/pfn/products/registered/arbsm.htm \n |title=Arbroath Smokie PGI \n |accessdate=8 February 2009 \n |date=31 March 2004 \n |work=Protected Food Names \n |publisher=HM Government \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225130959/http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/pfn/products/registered/arbsm.htm \n |archivedate=25 December 2008 \n |url-status = dead\n |df=dmy \n}} \n</ref> The preparation of smokies remains a [[cottage industry]] in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area.

After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present.

Since his tenure was marked by various internal conflicts, Kalinik decided to resign his post, and even went a step further: he sent a pre-agreed petition to the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] asking for the abolition of the Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107, citing accumulated debts as the main reason for this motion, signed by him and 5 other bishops.

Published at the Province of Negros Occidental official website</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nCandoni was derived from the native phrase Kan Dune,<ref name=\"CANDONI\" /> which means belonging to Dune, a legendary beautiful maiden named Dionesia who committed suicide after being forced by her parents to marry a man she did not love.\n\n==History==\n\nFormerly a barrio of the Municipality of Cauayan, Candoni started as the center of the Tabla Valley Settlement founded in 1935 by Santiago H. Diego, a prominent man from the Municipality of Isabela. He led a group of settlers with a pioneering spirit and prompted by the desire to have a piece of land they could call their own.  Pooling their resources and organizing themselves into a cooperative they called Tablenos, the settlers started clearing the valley starting from where the town is now located.  They toiled the forests enduring hardships, but many of them died of malaria.\n\nTheir efforts were noticed by the Provincial Government who supported them, starting with Gov. Emilio Gaston to Gov. Valenciano Gatuslao, who along with then Speaker Gil Montilla, helped them appeal to President Manuel Roxas in Malacanang for tangible government aid, which came in the form of the road from Dancalan, Ilog to Candoni, following the trail blazed by the Tablenos.\n\nCandoni was finally declared a municipality on August 22, 1958 through Executive Order No. 314 signed by President Carlos P. Garcia.  It was inaugurated on August 12, 1961, with Benjamin R. Nava as its first acting mayor.\n\nRecent history of Candoni again showed its people's struggle, this time, against the turmoils brought about by the insurgency problem. Fed up with being caught in the crossfire of battles between rebels and government forces, the people of Sitio Cantomanyog in Barangay Haba of the town declared their area as a \"Zone of Peace\", the first in the country ever to be declared as such by the residents composed of some 40 families, and this policy is respected by both rebels and government troops.\n\n==Geography==\n\nCandoni is located about 131&nbsp;km<ref name=\"CANDONI\"/> south-south-west of the provincial capital, [[Bacolod City]].

Amado Picardal.</ref> Zone of Peace in the Philippines. Peace Zone culture is so influential that the people of Cantomanyog were able to produce cultural products therefrom like oral history of Cantomanyog, poetry and music to the extent that it inspired a cluster of communities to do same.\n\nThe first skirmish between the NPA and the military happened in Southern Negros on September 1971. With the information that the NPA had a base in the towns of Candoni and Kabankalan, the military immediately sent troops in the said area to hunt down the rebels. The NPA's popularity in the hinterlands of Southern Negros, where government was seldom seen and felt, could be explained by its ability to dispense swift, revolutionary justice and maintain order in the community. On April 18, 1989, an undetermined number of NPA guerillas launched a surprise attack on the 7th IB, Alpha Company Detachment at Caningay, Candoni. The Caningay raid was one of the NPA's most daring attacks on a military outpost in Candoni.\n\nIn 1989, on the island of Negros, because of the inhuman conditions in the evacuation centers, nearly 300 persons - most of them were children - died from malnutrition and measles as the result of the U.S.-organized bombing raid, \"Operation Thunderbolt\" in the municipalities of Candoni, [[Hinoba-an, Negros Occidental|Hino\u2013baan]], [[Ilog, Negros Occidental|Ilog]], [[Cauayan, Negros Occidental|Cauayan]], [[Kabankalan]] and [[Sipalay, Negros Occidental|Sipalay]] popularly referred to as the CHICKS area. The people of Cantomanyog began to ask themselves, \"Why is this war happening here?\"\n\nIn November 1989, the Area Core Group leaders of the Gagmay'ng Kristiyanong Katilingban of Cantomanyog (GKK) or the Basic Ecclesial Community of Cantomanyog (BEC) after their usual panimbahon (community prayer meeting) discussed the peace zone concept. On December 4, 1989, the Basic Christian Community of Cantomanyog gathered for a General assembly wherein a Resolution to Establish the Zone of Peace was read, passed and approved. Their simple declaration was delivered to both the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the New People's Army. The NPA and the AFP respected the Zone of Peace.\n\nOn February 16, 1990, during a worship service and Eucharist, Natividad Epalan, a community leader holding her two-year-old child, read a statement declaring the village of Cantomanyog to be the first \"zone of peace\" in the Philippines.\n\n:''\"Our village is open to everyone whose intentions are good,\" she read. \"We wish to be free of the danger of weapons of war and death\u2026Therefore, whoever enters this zone of peace should not bring any guns with them.\"''\n\nOn 25 May 1993, Senator [[Rodolfo Biazon|Rodolfo G. Biazon]] sponsored a resolution passed by the Senate as Resolution No. 435 urging the Executive Department for the declaration of Cantomanyog and the other six Peace Zones as Special Development Areas. [[Fidel Ramos|President Ramos]], consequently and in cognizance to the Comprehensive Peace Policy, recognized the legitimacy of the said Peace Zones and further declared them as Special Development Areas (SDAs). Each of the seven SDAs was allocated P5,000,000.00 for community development projects through the then National Program for Unification and Development Council now part of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process under the Office of the President.\n\n=== Sit-an Cave ===\n\nSit-an Cave is a natural marvel that extends about one hundred fifty meters from its entrance to its hindmost part which resembles a church-like cavern with cool natural pool with overflowing water ranging from knee-high to waistline depth that forms an underground stream running along the columns of stalactites that hung like a pendant from its roof.\n\n===Festivals===\n\nThe [[Dinagyaw sa Tablas Festival]] is the annual town fiesta happen every February 7\u201311 and it is also called Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes. The [[Dinagyaw sa Tablas Festival]] aims to project and manifest the spirit of cooperation exerted by the Tablenos when they trail blazed the wilderness of the Tabla Velley and established the Tabla Valley settlement that became the predecessor of Candoni.\n\nDinagyaw came from the word ''dagyaw'' a Hiligaynon term which means a group of people helping each other to perform a specific task.\n\nAside from the annual town fiesta, Candonians also enjoy from multiple Barangay and community fiestas whole year-round.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Leopoldo Serantes]] &ndash;

Published at the Province of Negros Occidental official website</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nCandoni was derived from the native phrase Kan Dune,<ref name=\"CANDONI\" /> which means belonging to Dune, a legendary beautiful maiden named Dionesia who committed suicide after being forced by her parents to marry a man she did not love.\n\n==History==\n\nFormerly a barrio of the Municipality of Cauayan, Candoni started as the center of the Tabla Valley Settlement founded in 1935 by Santiago H. Diego, a prominent man from the Municipality of Isabela. He led a group of settlers with a pioneering spirit and prompted by the desire to have a piece of land they could call their own.  Pooling their resources and organizing themselves into a cooperative they called Tablenos, the settlers started clearing the valley starting from where the town is now located.  They toiled the forests enduring hardships, but many of them died of malaria.\n\nTheir efforts were noticed by the Provincial Government who supported them, starting with Gov. Emilio Gaston to Gov. Valenciano Gatuslao, who along with then Speaker Gil Montilla, helped them appeal to President Manuel Roxas in Malacanang for tangible government aid, which came in the form of the road from Dancalan, Ilog to Candoni, following the trail blazed by the Tablenos.\n\nCandoni was finally declared a municipality on August 22, 1958 through Executive Order No. 314 signed by President Carlos P. Garcia.  It was inaugurated on August 12, 1961, with Benjamin R. Nava as its first acting mayor.\n\nRecent history of Candoni again showed its people's struggle, this time, against the turmoils brought about by the insurgency problem. Fed up with being caught in the crossfire of battles between rebels and government forces, the people of Sitio Cantomanyog in Barangay Haba of the town declared their area as a \"Zone of Peace\", the first in the country ever to be declared as such by the residents composed of some 40 families, and this policy is respected by both rebels and government troops.\n\n==Geography==\n\nCandoni is located about 131&nbsp;km<ref name=\"CANDONI\"/> south-south-west of the provincial capital, [[Bacolod City]]. It is approximately four hour drive from Bacolod City aboard a public utility vehicle and about two hours and 45 minutes on a private car.  From Bacolod City, buses are available at Bacolod South Terminal. From [[Kabankalan City]], one can take the public utility jeepneys or buses going to this town. Candoni is the third town with highest elevation in Negros Occidental after [[Salvador Benedicto, Negros Occidental|Salvador Benedicto]] and [[San Carlos City, Negros Occidental|San Carlos City]].\n\n==Barangays==\n\nCandoni is politically subdivided into 9 [[barangay]]s.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Amado Picardal.</ref> Zone of Peace in the Philippines. Peace Zone culture is so influential that the people of Cantomanyog were able to produce cultural products therefrom like oral history of Cantomanyog, poetry and music to the extent that it inspired a cluster of communities to do same.\n\nThe first skirmish between the NPA and the military happened in Southern Negros on September 1971. With the information that the NPA had a base in the towns of Candoni and Kabankalan, the military immediately sent troops in the said area to hunt down the rebels. The NPA's popularity in the hinterlands of Southern Negros, where government was seldom seen and felt, could be explained by its ability to dispense swift, revolutionary justice and maintain order in the community. On April 18, 1989, an undetermined number of NPA guerillas launched a surprise attack on the 7th IB, Alpha Company Detachment at Caningay, Candoni. The Caningay raid was one of the NPA's most daring attacks on a military outpost in Candoni.\n\nIn 1989, on the island of Negros, because of the inhuman conditions in the evacuation centers, nearly 300 persons - most of them were children - died from malnutrition and measles as the result of the U.S.-organized bombing raid, \"Operation Thunderbolt\" in the municipalities of Candoni, [[Hinoba-an, Negros Occidental|Hino\u2013baan]], [[Ilog, Negros Occidental|Ilog]], [[Cauayan, Negros Occidental|Cauayan]], [[Kabankalan]] and [[Sipalay, Negros Occidental|Sipalay]] popularly referred to as the CHICKS area. The people of Cantomanyog began to ask themselves, \"Why is this war happening here?\"\n\nIn November 1989, the Area Core Group leaders of the Gagmay'ng Kristiyanong Katilingban of Cantomanyog (GKK) or the Basic Ecclesial Community of Cantomanyog (BEC) after their usual panimbahon (community prayer meeting) discussed the peace zone concept. On December 4, 1989, the Basic Christian Community of Cantomanyog gathered for a General assembly wherein a Resolution to Establish the Zone of Peace was read, passed and approved. Their simple declaration was delivered to both the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the New People's Army. The NPA and the AFP respected the Zone of Peace.\n\nOn February 16, 1990, during a worship service and Eucharist, Natividad Epalan, a community leader holding her two-year-old child, read a statement declaring the village of Cantomanyog to be the first \"zone of peace\" in the Philippines.\n\n:''\"Our village is open to everyone whose intentions are good,\" she read. \"We wish to be free of the danger of weapons of war and death\u2026Therefore, whoever enters this zone of peace should not bring any guns with them.\"''\n\nOn 25 May 1993, Senator [[Rodolfo Biazon|Rodolfo G. Biazon]] sponsored a resolution passed by the Senate as Resolution No. 435 urging the Executive Department for the declaration of Cantomanyog and the other six Peace Zones as Special Development Areas. [[Fidel Ramos|President Ramos]], consequently and in cognizance to the Comprehensive Peace Policy, recognized the legitimacy of the said Peace Zones and further declared them as Special Development Areas (SDAs). Each of the seven SDAs was allocated P5,000,000.00 for community development projects through the then National Program for Unification and Development Council now part of the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process under the Office of the President.\n\n=== Sit-an Cave ===\n\nSit-an Cave is a natural marvel that extends about one hundred fifty meters from its entrance to its hindmost part which resembles a church-like cavern with cool natural pool with overflowing water ranging from knee-high to waistline depth that forms an underground stream running along the columns of stalactites that hung like a pendant from its roof.\n\n===Festivals===\n\nThe [[Dinagyaw sa Tablas Festival]] is the annual town fiesta happen every February 7\u201311 and it is also called Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes. The [[Dinagyaw sa Tablas Festival]] aims to project and manifest the spirit of cooperation exerted by the Tablenos when they trail blazed the wilderness of the Tabla Velley and established the Tabla Valley settlement that became the predecessor of Candoni.\n\nDinagyaw came from the word ''dagyaw'' a Hiligaynon term which means a group of people helping each other to perform a specific task.\n\nAside from the annual town fiesta, Candonians also enjoy from multiple Barangay and community fiestas whole year-round.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Leopoldo Serantes]] &ndash; competed at the 1988 Seoul Olympics in the Light Flyweight (-48&nbsp;kg) division winning the bronze medal\n*[http://boxrec.com/boxer/693054 Romel Oliveros] &ndash; a super flyweight national boxer\n*[https://global.theiia.org/about/about-the-iia/Pages/William-S-Smith-Award.aspx Elisheba Etabag Manzano] &ndash; 2007 Gold Medal (Top 1) \u2013 Highest Achievement Award for Certified Internal Auditor exam.\n*[[Mary Grace Baloyo]] &ndash; was a First lieutenant in the Philippine Air Force who posthumously received the Philippines' highest military award for courage - the Medal of Valor\n\n==Climate==\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Candoni, Negros Occidental\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 31\n|Feb high C = 31\n|Mar high C = 32\n|Apr high C = 34\n|May high C = 33\n|Jun high C = 32\n|Jul high C = 31\n|Aug high C = 31\n|Sep high C = 31\n|Oct high C = 32\n|Nov high C = 31\n|Dec high C = 31\n|year high C = 34\n|Jan low C = 23\n|Feb low C = 23\n|Mar low C = 24\n|Apr low C = 25\n|May low C = 25\n|Jun low C = 25\n|Jul low C = 24\n|Aug low C = 24\n|Sep low C = 24\n|Oct low C = 24\n|Nov low C = 24\n|Dec low C = 23\n|year low C = 23\n|Jan precipitation mm = 39.2\n|Feb precipitation mm = 35.5\n|Mar precipitation mm = 38\n|Apr precipitation mm = 56.7\n|May precipitation mm = 155.6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 236.9\n|Jul precipitation mm = 375.8\n|Aug precipitation mm = 338.2\n|Sep precipitation mm = 249.7\n|Oct precipitation mm = 191.3\n|Nov precipitation mm = 133.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 113.9\n<!-- Average number of rainy days -->\n|Jan rain days = 11\n|Feb rain days = 7\n|Mar rain days = 8\n|Apr rain days = 6\n|May rain days = 13\n|Jun rain days = 19\n|Jul rain days = 22\n|Aug rain days = 19\n|Sep rain days = 19\n|Oct rain days = 19\n|Nov rain days = 16\n|Dec rain days = 14\n|source 1 = [http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Candoni-weather-averages/Negros-Occidental/PH.aspx worldweatheronline.com]\n|date=July 2016\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120413163013/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081120024509/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/census2007/index.html Philippine Census Information]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160304205713/http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=9&frmIdProvince=55&frmIdLgu=986 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Centre = Candoni\n| North  = [[Cauayan, Negros Occidental|Cauayan]]\n| East   = [[Ilog, Negros Occidental|Ilog]]\n| South  = [[Hinoba-an, Negros Occidental|Hinoba-an]]\n| West   = [[Sipalay]]\n}}\n{{Negros Occidental}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Negros Occidental]]\n", "name_user": "Uzume", "label": "safe", "comment": "defaults to the current QID", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candoni,_Negros_Occidental"}
