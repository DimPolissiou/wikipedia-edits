As its name suggests, it is aimed at children under 7 who have not started full-day school yet.

After Nickelodeon's preschool block premiered a slew of new shows in 1987, it began using the ''Nick Junior'' branding on January 4, 1988,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ8y7f0g0uI|title=Nickelodeon Early-Morning TV Broadcast from 1988 (with commercials)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=February 17, 2019}}</ref> coinciding with the premiere of ''[[The World of David the Gnome]]''.

Nick Jr.'s initial [[Station identification|network IDs]] were filmed in live action featuring two children wearing Nick Jr. shirts walking to a refrigerator and opening it, revealing an animated cartoon character. From 1989 to 2000, other companies and animators produced IDs for Nick Jr.\n\nUntil July 1990, ''[[Pinwheel (TV series)|Pinwheel]]'' was featured, originally for three hours (two in the morning and one at noon), then for one hour starting in spring 1989. When Nick Jr.'s original series ''[[Eureeka's Castle]]'' premiered in September, ''Pinwheel'' was split into two separate half hours in the morning and afternoon, where it remained until July 1990. Much of Nick Jr.'s other programs at the time were of Japanese or foreign origin (including ''[[Sharon, Lois & Bram's Elephant Show]]'', ''[[Adventures of the Little Koala]]'', ''[[The World of David the Gnome|David the Gnome]]'', ''[[Noozles]]'', ''[[Maya the Honey Bee|Maya the Bee]]'', and ''[[The Littl' Bits]]'').\n\n===Grow, Learn, and Play (1993\u20131994)===\nOn April 5, 1993, Nick Jr. premiered a new series ''[[Cappelli & Company]]'' and received a new rebrand which prominently featured a new Nick Jr. logo consisting of an orange parent and a blue child, and the slogan ''Grow, Learn, and Play''. Several Nick Jr. promos and bumpers featured kids playing near the Nick Jr. logo and a theme song with the slogan sung to the melody of [[London Bridge Is Falling Down|''London Bridge'']], and a few featured ''Cappelli & Company'' host [[Frank Cappelli]]. Nick Jr. also started using a female announcer (who was replaced by a different one in 1994, 1998 and 2003) in its promos and bumpers. Nick Jr. began to invest more into producing original interstitial series (including 1994's ''Muppet Time'', forty two-minute shorts from [[The Jim Henson Company]]) in order to stay within a self-imposed limit of five minutes of commercials per hour.\n\nDue to Nick Jr.'s declining ratings as well as competition from [[PBS]]' children's programming and [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]]'s ''[[Ready Set Learn]]'' block, Nickelodeon decided to spend $30 million on revamping their Nick Jr. block in 1994.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-03-28.pdf Nick to spend $30 million on kids (page 53)] from Broadcasting & Cable</ref> On April 4, the \"Jim Henson's Muppet Hour\" sub-block was created by pairing ''[[Jim Henson's Muppet Babies]]'' reruns with the new acquisition ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.\n\n===Play to Learn (1994\u20132003)===\nOn September 5, 1994, Nick Jr. rebranded and introduced Face, an animated host that introduced shows and interstitials and led into commercial breaks. In the context of his segments, Face was capable of materializing objects such as an astronaut, a robot, a clown, a window, a traffic light, stars, and even wood. He was also capable of creating a number of foley sound effects and voices including a signature three-note [[trumpet]] noise usually following the name \"Nick Jr.\" and at the end of almost every bumper. Also, he changed colors, moods, and feelings. Face was voiced by [[Chris Phillips (voice actor)|Chris Phillips]], who also narrated several Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. promos. More than 400 Face promos were produced by [[Nickelodeon Digital|Nick Digital]] (from 1994 to 1996 and 2000 to 2003) and DMA Animation (from 1996 to 1999). In October, Nick Jr. introduced two new original series, ''[[Gullah Gullah Island]]'' and ''[[Allegra's Window]]'', resulting in 50% rating gains for the block.\n\nOn September 8, 1996, the first episode of ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' premiered in prime-time on [[Nickelodeon]], then debuted on the Nick Jr. block the next day. Nick Jr. also premiered four new interstitial series and received a new rebrand produced by Pittard Sullivan. ''Blue's Clues'' quickly dethroned ''[[Gullah Gullah Island]]'' as Nick Jr.'s most popular series. In 1998, Nick Jr. rebranded again and introduced the \"Just for Me\" slogan.\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, Nick Jr. replaced most of its older series with newer series such as ''[[Franklin (TV series)|Franklin]]'', ''[[Kipper (TV series)|Kipper]]'', ''[[Maisy]]'', and ''[[Little Bill]]'' which helped increase the block's ratings. Nick Jr. briefly aired reruns of ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' in the Summer of 2000 to promote ''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'' before replacing it with ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'', which became one of Nick Jr.'s most successful series. ''[[Maggie and the Ferocious Beast]]'' premiered on the same day as when the block started airing ''Shining Time Station''. ''[[Bob the Builder]]'' and ''[[Oswald (TV series)|Oswald]]'' premiered in 2001. On September 3, 2001, Nick Jr. received a new rebrand produced by AdamsMorioka (who had previously rebranded Nickelodeon and [[Nick at Nite]]) and Editional Effects.\n\n===Nick Jr. Play Along (2003\u20132004)===\nOn September 1, 2003, Nick Jr. premiered the new series ''[[Rubbadubbers]]'' and received a rebrand that introduced more than a dozen new logos. A new interstitial series called ''Nick Jr. Play Along'' debuted, which were hosted by two fun live-action hosts: Robin (played by actress [[Hillary Hawkins]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Hillary Hawkins|url = http://www.hillaryhawkins.com|website = Hillary Hawkins|accessdate = 2015-07-29}}</ref>) and Zack (played by actor Travis Guba<ref>{{cite web|title = About|url = http://www.travisguba.com/about.html|website = www.travisguba.com|accessdate = 2015-07-29}}</ref>). Alongside Robin and Zack were two [[Sock puppet|sock puppets]] called the Feetbeats. \n\nNew Face interstitials were produced featuring a redesigned Face, who has added eyebrows and a chin and straightened the eyes by inverting their colors from white dots on black eyes to larger black dots on white eyes, and was voiced by [[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick on CBS]] announcer Babi Floyd. The new Face promos were produced by Vee-Pee Cartoons. Nick Jr. also removed most of its older interstitial series, although they briefly returned in 2004 due to polarizing reactions to their new interstitial series.\n\n===Love to Play! (2004\u20132007)===\nOn September 13, 2004, Nick Jr. received a rebrand containing interstitials co-produced with [[Little Airplane Productions]] featuring the block's new host Piper O'Possum (voiced by [[Ali Brustofski]]), and the new slogan \"Love to Play\". Nick Jr.'s female announcer was replaced with Kobie Powell and Chris Phillips. Nick Jr. used its new on-screen bug to promote its website, but it was changed on March 6, 2006 after the FCC forbade this and used Nick Jr.'s 2003\u20132004 regular screen bug again. ''[[LazyTown]]'', ''[[Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends]]'' and ''[[The Backyardigans]]'' premiered on Nick Jr. in 2004; they were briefly shown on Noggin during Thanksgiving week before joining Noggin's regular schedule later.\n\nOn September 7, 2007, the Piper O'Possum interstitials ended their 3-year run.\n\n===Play With Us (2007\u20132009)===\nOn September 10, 2007, Nick Jr. received another rebrand. The block's bumpers (which were often similar to Noggin's \"Puzzle Time\" interstitials) encouraged preschoolers to \"Play With Us\" and featured the Nick Jr. logo in the form of two stuffed animals animated in stop-motion. This marks the first time that the Nick Jr. block had no host since 1994. Nick Jr. also stopped airing interstitial series and increased the amount of commercials it aired. Starting in the spring of 2008, the block began at 8:30 am.\n\nOn January 30, 2009, the original block ended its 21-year run, with ''[[Ni Hao, Kai-Lan]]'' being the last show to air on the block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://animesuperhero.com/forums/threads/nick-tv-schedule-january-26-february-1-2009.4664301/|title=Nick TV Schedule: January 26 \u2013 February 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Nickelodeon branding (2009\u20132014)===\n{{main|Nick Jr.}}\nOn February 2, 2009, the classic Nick Jr. block was re-branded as ''Nick Play Date''; ''[[Olivia (TV series)|Olivia]]'' premiered on the classic block the week before. The block's branding was based on Noggin's branding, and many bumpers featured drawings, finger puppets or cupcakes. The bumpers' music was a choir of kids vocalizing, and [[Nicolette Pierini]] was the announcer of each bumper. On September 28, 2009, Nick Jr. replaced [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] as a 24/7 TV channel as part of Nickelodeon's overall rebrand. In 2011, ''Play Date'' received a new rebrand featuring characters from the block's shows. The following year, the block's ''Play Date'' branding was replaced with a modified version of Nick Jr.'s new branding known as ''Nick: The Smart Place to Play''. Despite Nickelodeon displaying its shows credits during the last 30 seconds before it since 2012, the branding retained the split-screen credits for Nick Jr. shows airing on the block until May 2, 2014.\n\n===Return of Nick Jr. branding (2014\u2013present)===\nOn May 5, 2014, Nickelodeon's preschool block re-branded itself as Nick Jr. while still using the Nickelodeon name for the screen bug (and promos starting in 2015). When aired on the Nick Jr. channel, commercials for programs broadcast on Nickelodeon's Nick Jr. block usually end with \"Over on Nickelodeon\" to differentiate the titles. The Nick Jr. block also began to use Nick's superimposed credits to air more commercials. On June 10, 2015, Nick Jr.'s website was completely redesigned to match up with the Nick Jr. app.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2015/06/10/nick-jr-site-gets-a-redesign-debuts-new-preschool-series/|title=Nick Jr. site gets a redesign, debuts new preschool series|publisher=|accessdate=5 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn May 21, 2018, the Nick Jr. block changed its name to \"Nick Jr. on Nick\", refreshing its imaging with new bumpers and curriculum boards. From November 12, 2018 to March 2020, the block reverted back to using the Nickelodeon name for the screen bug and in advertisements while retaining the refreshed Nick Jr. bumpers and curriculum boards.\n\n==Slogans==\n*Nick Jr.'s Just For You!

From 2002 to 2004, it was part of the general ''Nick on CBS'' block, which also included programming from the main Nickelodeon channel. The block was replaced by the ''[[KOL Secret Slumber Party]]'' block on September 16, 2006.\n\nSpanish-language American network [[Telemundo]] has aired ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' (from 1998 to 2000, as part of the ''Nickelodeon en Telemundo'' block) and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' (from 2005 to 2006, as part of the ''Telemundo Kids'' block) in Spanish. In Fall of 2006, after the sale of Telemundo to NBC in 2001 and the CBS/Viacom split in early 2006, the ''Telemundo Kids'' block was replaced with a Spanish version of [[NBC]]/[[Ion Television|Ion]]'s ''[[Qubo]]'' block.\n\nOn April 5, 2008, competing Spanish network [[Univision]] added back the Spanish-dubbed version of ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and also added a Spanish-dubbed version of ''[[Go, Diego, Go!]]'' to their Saturday morning ''[[Planeta U]]'' line-up. A Spanish-dubbed version of [[The Backyardigans]] was later added to the line-up on January 8, 2011.\n\nFor a brief time in summer 2010, [[MTV Tres|Tr3s]], a sister network to [[Nickelodeon]], aired a daily block of Spanish-dubbed Nick Jr. programs under the name ''Tr3s Jr.'' Shows like ''Pistas de Blue'' (the Spanish version of ''[[Blue's Clues]]'') and ''[[Wonder Pets!]]'' were featured in the block.\n\n===Face's reappearances===\nFace (the '90s version) made an appearance during the 2012 New Year edition of [[NickRewind|The '90s Are All That]], [[TeenNick]]'s former 1990s-oriented late night block. Face's appearances consisted of out-of-context clips that make him appear to be drunk or making adult comments (e.g.: \"Yeah, grow a pair!\").\n\nFace also appeared in an Easter promo for [[NickRewind|The Splat]], The '90s Are All That's successor, in 2016, encouraging viewers to look for the [[Easter Bunny]] in '90s [[Nickelodeon]] shows.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dance and Sing!

From 1989 to 2000, other companies and animators produced IDs for Nick Jr.\n\nUntil July 1990, ''[[Pinwheel (TV series)|Pinwheel]]'' was featured, originally for three hours (two in the morning and one at noon), then for one hour starting in spring 1989. When Nick Jr.'s original series ''[[Eureeka's Castle]]'' premiered in September, ''Pinwheel'' was split into two separate half hours in the morning and afternoon, where it remained until July 1990. Much of Nick Jr.'s other programs at the time were of Japanese or foreign origin (including ''[[Sharon, Lois & Bram's Elephant Show]]'', ''[[Adventures of the Little Koala]]'', ''[[The World of David the Gnome|David the Gnome]]'', ''[[Noozles]]'', ''[[Maya the Honey Bee|Maya the Bee]]'', and ''[[The Littl' Bits]]'').\n\n===Grow, Learn, and Play (1993\u20131994)===\nOn April 5, 1993, Nick Jr. premiered a new series ''[[Cappelli & Company]]'' and received a new rebrand which prominently featured a new Nick Jr. logo consisting of an orange parent and a blue child, and the slogan ''Grow, Learn, and Play''. Several Nick Jr. promos and bumpers featured kids playing near the Nick Jr. logo and a theme song with the slogan sung to the melody of [[London Bridge Is Falling Down|''London Bridge'']], and a few featured ''Cappelli & Company'' host [[Frank Cappelli]]. Nick Jr. also started using a female announcer (who was replaced by a different one in 1994, 1998 and 2003) in its promos and bumpers. Nick Jr. began to invest more into producing original interstitial series (including 1994's ''Muppet Time'', forty two-minute shorts from [[The Jim Henson Company]]) in order to stay within a self-imposed limit of five minutes of commercials per hour.\n\nDue to Nick Jr.'s declining ratings as well as competition from [[PBS]]' children's programming and [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]]'s ''[[Ready Set Learn]]'' block, Nickelodeon decided to spend $30 million on revamping their Nick Jr. block in 1994.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-03-28.pdf Nick to spend $30 million on kids (page 53)] from Broadcasting & Cable</ref> On April 4, the \"Jim Henson's Muppet Hour\" sub-block was created by pairing ''[[Jim Henson's Muppet Babies]]'' reruns with the new acquisition ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.\n\n===Play to Learn (1994\u20132003)===\nOn September 5, 1994, Nick Jr. rebranded and introduced Face, an animated host that introduced shows and interstitials and led into commercial breaks. In the context of his segments, Face was capable of materializing objects such as an astronaut, a robot, a clown, a window, a traffic light, stars, and even wood. He was also capable of creating a number of foley sound effects and voices including a signature three-note [[trumpet]] noise usually following the name \"Nick Jr.\" and at the end of almost every bumper. Also, he changed colors, moods, and feelings. Face was voiced by [[Chris Phillips (voice actor)|Chris Phillips]], who also narrated several Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. promos. More than 400 Face promos were produced by [[Nickelodeon Digital|Nick Digital]] (from 1994 to 1996 and 2000 to 2003) and DMA Animation (from 1996 to 1999). In October, Nick Jr. introduced two new original series, ''[[Gullah Gullah Island]]'' and ''[[Allegra's Window]]'', resulting in 50% rating gains for the block.\n\nOn September 8, 1996, the first episode of ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' premiered in prime-time on [[Nickelodeon]], then debuted on the Nick Jr. block the next day. Nick Jr. also premiered four new interstitial series and received a new rebrand produced by Pittard Sullivan. ''Blue's Clues'' quickly dethroned ''[[Gullah Gullah Island]]'' as Nick Jr.'s most popular series. In 1998, Nick Jr. rebranded again and introduced the \"Just for Me\" slogan.\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, Nick Jr. replaced most of its older series with newer series such as ''[[Franklin (TV series)|Franklin]]'', ''[[Kipper (TV series)|Kipper]]'', ''[[Maisy]]'', and ''[[Little Bill]]'' which helped increase the block's ratings. Nick Jr. briefly aired reruns of ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' in the Summer of 2000 to promote ''[[Thomas and the Magic Railroad]]'' before replacing it with ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'', which became one of Nick Jr.'s most successful series. ''[[Maggie and the Ferocious Beast]]'' premiered on the same day as when the block started airing ''Shining Time Station''. ''[[''[[Bob the Builder]]'' and ''[[Oswald (TV series)|Oswald]]'' premiered in 2001. On September 3, 2001, Nick Jr. received a new rebrand produced by AdamsMorioka (who had previously rebranded Nickelodeon and [[Nick at Nite]]) and Editional Effects.\n\n===Nick Jr. Play Along (2003\u20132004)===\nOn September 1, 2003, Nick Jr. premiered the new series ''[[Rubbadubbers]]'' and received a rebrand that introduced more than a dozen new logos. A new interstitial series called ''Nick Jr. Play Along'' debuted, which were hosted by two fun live-action hosts: Robin (played by actress [[Hillary Hawkins]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Hillary Hawkins|url = http://www.hillaryhawkins.com|website = Hillary Hawkins|accessdate = 2015-07-29}}</ref>) and Zack (played by actor Travis Guba<ref>{{cite web|title = About|url = http://www.travisguba.com/about.html|website = www.travisguba.com|accessdate = 2015-07-29}}</ref>). Alongside Robin and Zack were two [[Sock puppet|sock puppets]] called the Feetbeats. \n\nNew Face interstitials were produced featuring a redesigned Face, who has added eyebrows and a chin and straightened the eyes by inverting their colors from white dots on black eyes to larger black dots on white eyes, and was voiced by [[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick on CBS]] announcer Babi Floyd. The new Face promos were produced by Vee-Pee Cartoons. Nick Jr. also removed most of its older interstitial series, although they briefly returned in 2004 due to polarizing reactions to their new interstitial series.\n\n===Love to Play! (2004\u20132007)===\nOn September 13, 2004, Nick Jr. received a rebrand containing interstitials co-produced with [[Little Airplane Productions]] featuring the block's new host Piper O'Possum (voiced by [[Ali Brustofski]]), and the new slogan \"Love to Play\". Nick Jr.'s female announcer was replaced with Kobie Powell and Chris Phillips. Nick Jr. used its new on-screen bug to promote its website, but it was changed on March 6, 2006 after the FCC forbade this and used Nick Jr.'s 2003\u20132004 regular screen bug again. ''[[LazyTown]]'', ''[[Miss Spider's Sunny Patch Friends]]'' and ''[[The Backyardigans]]'' premiered on Nick Jr. in 2004; they were briefly shown on Noggin during Thanksgiving week before joining Noggin's regular schedule later.\n\nOn September 7, 2007, the Piper O'Possum interstitials ended their 3-year run.\n\n===Play With Us (2007\u20132009)===\nOn September 10, 2007, Nick Jr. received another rebrand. The block's bumpers (which were often similar to Noggin's \"Puzzle Time\" interstitials) encouraged preschoolers to \"Play With Us\" and featured the Nick Jr. logo in the form of two stuffed animals animated in stop-motion. This marks the first time that the Nick Jr. block had no host since 1994. Nick Jr. also stopped airing interstitial series and increased the amount of commercials it aired. Starting in the spring of 2008, the block began at 8:30 am.\n\nOn January 30, 2009, the original block ended its 21-year run, with ''[[Ni Hao, Kai-Lan]]'' being the last show to air on the block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://animesuperhero.com/forums/threads/nick-tv-schedule-january-26-february-1-2009.4664301/|title=Nick TV Schedule: January 26 \u2013 February 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Nickelodeon branding (2009\u20132014)===\n{{main|Nick Jr.}}\nOn February 2, 2009, the classic Nick Jr. block was re-branded as ''Nick Play Date''; ''[[Olivia (TV series)|Olivia]]'' premiered on the classic block the week before. The block's branding was based on Noggin's branding, and many bumpers featured drawings, finger puppets or cupcakes. The bumpers' music was a choir of kids vocalizing, and [[Nicolette Pierini]] was the announcer of each bumper. On September 28, 2009, Nick Jr. replaced [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] as a 24/7 TV channel as part of Nickelodeon's overall rebrand. In 2011, ''Play Date'' received a new rebrand featuring characters from the block's shows. The following year, the block's ''Play Date'' branding was replaced with a modified version of Nick Jr.'s new branding known as ''Nick: The Smart Place to Play''. Despite Nickelodeon displaying its shows credits during the last 30 seconds before it since 2012, the branding retained the split-screen credits for Nick Jr. shows airing on the block until May 2, 2014.\n\n===Return of Nick Jr. branding (2014\u2013present)===\nOn May 5, 2014, Nickelodeon's preschool block re-branded itself as Nick Jr. while still using the Nickelodeon name for the screen bug (and promos starting in 2015). When aired on the Nick Jr. channel, commercials for programs broadcast on Nickelodeon's Nick Jr. block usually end with \"Over on Nickelodeon\" to differentiate the titles. The Nick Jr. block also began to use Nick's superimposed credits to air more commercials. On June 10, 2015, Nick Jr.'s website was completely redesigned to match up with the Nick Jr. app.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2015/06/10/nick-jr-site-gets-a-redesign-debuts-new-preschool-series/|title=Nick Jr. site gets a redesign, debuts new preschool series|publisher=|accessdate=5 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn May 21, 2018, the Nick Jr. block changed its name to \"Nick Jr. on Nick\", refreshing its imaging with new bumpers and curriculum boards. From November 12, 2018 to March 2020, the block reverted back to using the Nickelodeon name for the screen bug and in advertisements while retaining the refreshed Nick Jr. bumpers and curriculum boards.\n\n==Slogans==\n*Nick Jr.'s Just For You!

From 2002 to 2004, it was part of the general ''Nick on CBS'' block, which also included programming from the main Nickelodeon channel. The block was replaced by the ''[[KOL Secret Slumber Party]]'' block on September 16, 2006.\n\nSpanish-language American network [[Telemundo]] has aired ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' (from 1998 to 2000, as part of the ''Nickelodeon en Telemundo'' block) and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' (from 2005 to 2006, as part of the ''Telemundo Kids'' block) in Spanish. In Fall of 2006, after the sale of Telemundo to NBC in 2001 and the CBS/Viacom split in early 2006, the ''Telemundo Kids'' block was replaced with a Spanish version of [[NBC]]/[[Ion Television|Ion]]'s ''[[Qubo]]'' block.\n\nOn April 5, 2008, competing Spanish network [[Univision]] added back the Spanish-dubbed version of ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and also added a Spanish-dubbed version of ''[[Go, Diego, Go!]]'' to their Saturday morning ''[[Planeta U]]'' line-up. A Spanish-dubbed version of [[The Backyardigans]] was later added to the line-up on January 8, 2011.\n\nFor a brief time in summer 2010, [[MTV Tres|Tr3s]], a sister network to [[Nickelodeon]], aired a daily block of Spanish-dubbed Nick Jr. programs under the name ''Tr3s Jr.'' Shows like ''Pistas de Blue'' (the Spanish version of ''[[Blue's Clues]]'') and ''[[Wonder Pets!]]'' were featured in the block.\n\n===Face's reappearances===\nFace (the '90s version) made an appearance during the 2012 New Year edition of [[NickRewind|The '90s Are All That]], [[TeenNick]]'s former 1990s-oriented late night block. Face's appearances consisted of out-of-context clips that make him appear to be drunk or making adult comments (e.g.: \"Yeah, grow a pair!\").\n\nFace also appeared in an Easter promo for [[NickRewind|The Splat]], The '90s Are All That's successor, in 2016, encouraging viewers to look for the [[Easter Bunny]] in '90s [[Nickelodeon]] shows.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dance and Sing!
