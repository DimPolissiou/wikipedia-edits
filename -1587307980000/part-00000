The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. Raquel visits \u00c1ngel in the hospital, where the police arrest her. At a moral crossroads, she initially refuses to divulge the Professor's hideout, but when Colonel Prieto threatens her with several charges that would ensure her daughter be taken away from her, she finally tells him. As the police race to the hideout, a tactical squad inside the Mint is fought off by Berlin so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, despite the Professor's desperate calls for him to come. Berlin insistently continues, and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police arrive to the empty hideout. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force and that the robbers' whereabouts are still unknown.

In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this.

In flashbacks, Marseille, Bogot\u00e1 and the Professor celebrate Berlin's wedding to Tatiana, but the Professor expresses concern to Berlin about marrying since he has a terminal illness. In the present, the Professor and Marseille break into the apartment of Tamayo's assistant, Anto\u00f1anzas, but he jumps out of his window into the pool below. Sierra tells Lisbon that if she cooperates, her probable 30 year sentence would potentially be reduced to 10 years, and that she would be out in five years.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 26\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = Lecci\u00f3n de anatom\u00eda\n| AltTitle        = Anatomy Lesson\n| DirectedBy      = \u00c1lex Rodrigo\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = The Professor and Marseille help Anto\u00f1anzas out of the pool, and persuade him to do tasks for them by offering him \u20ac1 million. They fit his apartment with fake bombs as an alibi if the police discover him working for the Professor. Anto\u00f1anzas admits that Lisbon is being held in the tent; the Professor gives him his watch to wear so that she would know that the Professor is aware that she is alive. Lisbon's ex-husband, Alberto, examines the ambulance that the Professor and Lisbon had used for mobile transportation and broadcasting, and finds a phone SIM card that Lisbon had attempted to destroy. Although burnt, it is able to be analyzed, and the police find solely one call that was made to [[Mindanao]], Philippines\u2014where Lisbon's mother and daughter are staying. Sierra tells Lisbon that they know where they live, and allows Lisbon to call them so they can leave before the police arrive. Just as Lisbon is about to make the call, she notices Anto\u00f1anzas wearing the Professor's watch, so she stops. In flashbacks, the Professor raises reservations of Palermo's ability to be a team player to Berlin, who has concern that he has more love for the plan and being in command than for the team. In the present, Palermo creates chaos to reestablish his command by colluding with Gand\u00eda, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gand\u00eda dislocates his thumbs in order to slip through his handcuffs as verbally aided by Palermo. Rio, guarding the hostages, is emotionally unable to stop Gand\u00eda from escaping. Meanwhile, Nairobi becomes conscious.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 27\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n| Title           = Suspiros de Espa\u00f1a\n| AltTitle        = Pasodoble\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = The gang rush to find Gand\u00eda.

Gand\u00eda later almost kills Helsinki by hanging as he drops a noose around his neck from the ceiling. Bogot\u00e1 and Tokyo save Helsinki. Before Gand\u00eda retreats to a secret [[panic room]], he cuts the telecommunication cords that render the Professor's cameras in the bank inoperative. The panic room is equipped with weapons and a communication centre, which Gand\u00eda uses to communicate with Tamayo. Tamayo tells him that they are under a truce with the Professor, but he wants to coordinate an attack. Anto\u00f1anzas tells the Professor that Gand\u00eda is communicating with the police from a panic room, and as the Professor relays this information to Tokyo, Gand\u00eda knocks her out from behind.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = 5 minutos antes\n| AltTitle        = 5 Minutes Earlier\n| DirectedBy      = Koldo Serra, \u00c1lex Rodrigo\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = In flashbacks, Denver and Moscow ask the Professor if Juan, Moscow's godchild, can join them in the heist, but the Professor is hesitant. In the present, Gand\u00eda restrains Tokyo in the panic room, and announces on the bank's intercom that he has Tokyo, and that Palermo was the one who aided his escape. In flashbacks, Berlin tells the Professor that the dozens of hostages could stage a rebellion at some point, and that it would be wise to have an infiltrated member pose as a hostage to diffuse a potential revolt. The Professor, Moscow and Denver meet Juan, who is now a [[trans woman]] that goes by Julia. In the present, she poses as a hostage in the bank, and goes by \"Manila.\" Palermo admits to the Professor that what Gand\u00eda said is true; the Professor assures he will be punished later, and orders the group to unchain him. The robbers continue to melt the gold in the [[foundry]]\u201443.5 tonnes at that point. While in the freight elevator, Bogot\u00e1 and Nairobi kiss passionately and mentions they should marry after the heist. As Rio and Denver enter an elevator, Gand\u00eda throws a grenade into it just as the doors close, and the two rush to muffle the grenade with their bulletproof vests and helmets; they survive the explosion. As a shootout ensues between Gand\u00eda and all members of the gang, with the exception of the restrained Tokyo and wheelchair-bound Nairobi who remains armed in a bathroom, Gand\u00eda escapes through a duct.

Gand\u00eda shoots a hole through the door and forces her head through it while he ties her hands to the door. In flashbacks, Nairobi asks the Professor to be the father of her child by [[in vitro fertilisation]] because she believes the Professor to have good genes. Initially opposed to the idea, the Professor agrees. In the present, although the panic room is not present on the bank's blueprints, the Professor deduces the location of the panic room to be in the vicinity of the governor's office\u2014behind the governor's bathroom. The Professor tells Palermo this. Tamayo and Su\u00e1rez plan an assault on the bank. Meanwhile, the Professor sends Marseille to Algeria, where the police tortured Rio, to gather intel. Gand\u00eda unties Nairobi and uses her to escape while the group holds him at gunpoint.

The gang uncover the tunnel to the panic room behind the governor's bathroom. Tamayo calls Gand\u00eda's communications centre, but the telecommunication cords are cut by Bogot\u00e1 before he can answer. The Professor tells the gang to drill a hole through to the panic room and inject narcotic gas to incapacitate Gand\u00eda before rescuing Tokyo. The Professor gets people to put up posters all over Madrid that bear the face of Rio with the title \"buried alive,\" and nationally broadcasts a video of Rio recounting his illegal detainment and torture by police. Meanwhile, the Professor enlists Benjam\u00edn, father of Manila, and his crew to participate in a plan to free Lisbon. In a press conference, Colonel Prieto denies Rio's accusations, but Marseille forces a man who had taken part in Rio's torture in Algeria to corroborate Rio's story, which is broadcast nationally via video during the press conference. This deflates Tamayo's plans, and he calls off his planned assault on the bank. Tamayo tells Sierra that she must take the blame. Meanwhile, Gand\u00eda unties Tokyo to remove the shrapnel from his back, but she knocks him unconscious and the group frees her. The Professor then nationally broadcasts a video of himself exposing the illegal detainment of Lisbon inside the police tent outside the bank. The [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Ministry of the Interior]] takes over Lisbon's custody, and removes her from the tent.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 31\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 16\n| Title           = Plan Par\u00eds\n| AltTitle        = The Paris Plan\n| DirectedBy      = Jes\u00fas Colmenar\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = In flashbacks, Berlin confronts Palermo about his feelings towards him, while also revealing his own feelings for Palermo. They passionately kiss, however, Berlin says they must part ways and give up the plan because their love would interfere too much. In the present, Sierra admits to several damaging acts to the press, including implicating Colonel Tamayo. At a restaurant, Benjam\u00edn and Marseille construct a tunnel that leads to the parking garage of the Supreme Court, where Lisbon is brought to testify. As Sierra is fired and legal proceedings begin against her, she commences a pursuit of the Professor on her own. Sierra deduces that Anto\u00f1anzas must be a mole. After she extracts information from his wife, she obtains security camera footage from outside the apartment building, and watches footage of Anto\u00f1anzas being helped out of the pool by the Professor, as well as the license plate of his car from the parking lot. Benjam\u00edn and his crew, disguised as court personnel, seize the guards as Lisbon is escorted from the court through the parking garage. They strap them with bombs, bring in a woman disguised as Lisbon, and force them to take their normally scheduled route. Lisbon escapes through the tunnel. The gang forces Gand\u00eda to radio Tamayo that he is in another attack and requests to be evacuated from the roof. The Professor intercepts Tamayo's request for a helicopter, and brings his own, acquired on the black market, piloted by Marseille to deceptively transport a disguised Lisbon to the bank. As Lisbon descends from the helicopter, the gang creates a ruse on the roof to create the impression that Gand\u00eda is fighting. Lisbon is reunited with the gang, and they chant \"for Nairobi!\" just as Sierra finds the Professor's hideout, and holds him at gunpoint.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Money Heist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Money Heist'' episodes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Money Heist episodes, List of}}\n[[Category:Lists of crime drama television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of Spanish television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Money Heist|Episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n''[[Money Heist]]'' ({{lang-es|La casa de papel}}, {{trans|The House of Paper}}) is a Spanish television series created by [[\u00c1lex Pina]].

The robbers rush to escape with the money they printed since the 128 hours inside the Mint, about half of their planned time in the Mint of 11 days. As a result, the total money printed was also less than the planned \u20ac2.4 billion, having printed \u20ac984 million. Raquel finds the Professor's hideout and she is tied up. Raquel and the Professor kiss passionately and he lets her go. Raquel visits \u00c1ngel in the hospital, where the police arrest her. At a moral crossroads, she initially refuses to divulge the Professor's hideout, but when Colonel Prieto threatens her with several charges that would ensure her daughter be taken away from her, she finally tells him. As the police race to the hideout, a tactical squad inside the Mint is fought off by Berlin so the rest of the robbers can escape in time, despite the Professor's desperate calls for him to come. Berlin insistently continues, and is finally shot multiple times. The remaining robbers, with the addition of M\u00f3nica, escape from the Mint, through the tunnel, leading to the Professor's hideout minutes before the police arrive to the empty hideout. One year after the heist, it is reported that Raquel had left the force and that the robbers' whereabouts are still unknown.

In the present, Sierra plans to neutralize the Professor's blackmail leverage by releasing false information to the media. Tamayo agrees and organizes a second breach led by Su\u00e1rez. The Professor and Lisbon have an argument and lose communication with the team inside the bank, just after learning this.

They fit his apartment with fake bombs as an alibi if the police discover him working for the Professor. Anto\u00f1anzas admits that Lisbon is being held in the tent; the Professor gives him his watch to wear so that she would know that the Professor is aware that she is alive. Lisbon's ex-husband, Alberto, examines the ambulance that the Professor and Lisbon had used for mobile transportation and broadcasting, and finds a phone SIM card that Lisbon had attempted to destroy. Although burnt, it is able to be analyzed, and the police find solely one call that was made to [[Mindanao]], Philippines\u2014where Lisbon's mother and daughter are staying. Sierra tells Lisbon that they know where they live, and allows Lisbon to call them so they can leave before the police arrive. Just as Lisbon is about to make the call, she notices Anto\u00f1anzas wearing the Professor's watch, so she stops. In flashbacks, the Professor raises reservations of Palermo's ability to be a team player to Berlin, who has concern that he has more love for the plan and being in command than for the team.

Gand\u00eda dislocates his thumbs in order to slip through his handcuffs as verbally aided by Palermo. Rio, guarding the hostages, is emotionally unable to stop Gand\u00eda from escaping.

Gand\u00eda later almost kills Helsinki by hanging as he drops a noose around his neck from the ceiling. Bogot\u00e1 and Tokyo save Helsinki. Before Gand\u00eda retreats to a secret [[panic room]], he cuts the telecommunication cords that render the Professor's cameras in the bank inoperative. The panic room is equipped with weapons and a communication centre, which Gand\u00eda uses to communicate with Tamayo. Tamayo tells him that they are under a truce with the Professor, but he wants to coordinate an attack. Anto\u00f1anzas tells the Professor that Gand\u00eda is communicating with the police from a panic room, and as the Professor relays this information to Tokyo, Gand\u00eda knocks her out from behind.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = 5 minutos antes\n| AltTitle        = 5 Minutes Earlier\n| DirectedBy      = Koldo Serra, \u00c1lex Rodrigo\n| WrittenBy       = Ana Boyero, Jaun Salvador L\u00f3pez, Emilio D\u00edez, Luis Moya\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|3|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = In flashbacks, Denver and Moscow ask the Professor if Juan, Moscow's godchild, can join them in the heist, but the Professor is hesitant.

In flashbacks, Berlin tells the Professor that the dozens of hostages could stage a rebellion at some point, and that it would be wise to have an infiltrated member pose as a hostage to diffuse a potential revolt. The Professor, Moscow and Denver meet Juan, who is now a [[trans woman]] that goes by Julia. In the present, she poses as a hostage in the bank, and goes by \"Manila.\" Palermo admits to the Professor that what Gand\u00eda said is true; the Professor assures he will be punished later, and orders the group to unchain him. The robbers continue to melt the gold in the [[foundry]]\u201443.5 tonnes at that point. While in the freight elevator, Bogot\u00e1 and Nairobi kiss passionately and mentions they should marry after the heist. As Rio and Denver enter an elevator, Gand\u00eda throws a grenade into it just as the doors close, and the two rush to muffle the grenade with their bulletproof vests and helmets; they survive the explosion. As a shootout ensues between Gand\u00eda and all members of the gang, with the exception of the restrained Tokyo and wheelchair-bound Nairobi who remains armed in a bathroom, Gand\u00eda escapes through a duct.

Initially opposed to the idea, the Professor agrees. In the present, although the panic room is not present on the bank's blueprints, the Professor deduces the location of the panic room to be in the vicinity of the governor's office\u2014behind the governor's bathroom. The Professor tells Palermo this. Tamayo and Su\u00e1rez plan an assault on the bank. Meanwhile, the Professor sends Marseille to Algeria, where the police tortured Rio, to gather intel.

The gang uncover the tunnel to the panic room behind the governor's bathroom. Tamayo calls Gand\u00eda's communications centre, but the telecommunication cords are cut by Bogot\u00e1 before he can answer. The Professor tells the gang to drill a hole through to the panic room and inject narcotic gas to incapacitate Gand\u00eda before rescuing Tokyo. The Professor gets people to put up posters all over Madrid that bear the face of Rio with the title \"buried alive,\" and nationally broadcasts a video of Rio recounting his illegal detainment and torture by police. Meanwhile, the Professor enlists Benjam\u00edn, father of Manila, and his crew to participate in a plan to free Lisbon. In a press conference, Colonel Prieto denies Rio's accusations, but Marseille forces a man who had taken part in Rio's torture in Algeria to corroborate Rio's story, which is broadcast nationally via video during the press conference. This deflates Tamayo's plans, and he calls off his planned assault on the bank. Tamayo tells Sierra that she must take the blame. Meanwhile, Gand\u00eda unties Tokyo to remove the shrapnel from his back, but she knocks him unconscious and the group frees her. The Professor then nationally broadcasts a video of himself exposing the illegal detainment of Lisbon inside the police tent outside the bank.

They passionately kiss, however, Berlin says they must part ways and give up the plan because their love would interfere too much. In the present, Sierra admits to several damaging acts to the press, including implicating Colonel Tamayo. At a restaurant, Benjam\u00edn and Marseille construct a tunnel that leads to the parking garage of the Supreme Court, where Lisbon is brought to testify. As Sierra is fired and legal proceedings begin against her, she commences a pursuit of the Professor on her own. Sierra deduces that Anto\u00f1anzas must be a mole. After she extracts information from his wife, she obtains security camera footage from outside the apartment building, and watches footage of Anto\u00f1anzas being helped out of the pool by the Professor, as well as the license plate of his car from the parking lot. Benjam\u00edn and his crew, disguised as court personnel, seize the guards as Lisbon is escorted from the court through the parking garage. They strap them with bombs, bring in a woman disguised as Lisbon, and force them to take their normally scheduled route. Lisbon escapes through the tunnel. The gang forces Gand\u00eda to radio Tamayo that he is in another attack and requests to be evacuated from the roof. The Professor intercepts Tamayo's request for a helicopter, and brings his own, acquired on the black market, piloted by Marseille to deceptively transport a disguised Lisbon to the bank. As Lisbon descends from the helicopter, the gang creates a ruse on the roof to create the impression that Gand\u00eda is fighting. Lisbon is reunited with the gang, and they chant \"for Nairobi!\" just as Sierra finds the Professor's hideout, and holds him at gunpoint.\n| LineColor       = #295E6E\n}}\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Money Heist}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Money Heist'' episodes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Money Heist episodes, List of}}\n[[Category:Lists of crime drama television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Lists of Spanish television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Money Heist|Episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Gaurav.singhal7303", "label": "safe", "comment": "I have changed the episodes details", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Money_Heist_episodes"}

The television studio now features a window looking down onto [[Portage Avenue|Portage]]. A new digital [[Betacam SX]] format was introduced, one of the first CBC stations to transition to make use of it. The first television broadcast from the new studio occurred on Monday, September 21, 1998.\n\nPrevious programs produced at CBWT include ''[[Fred Penner's Place]]'', ''[[It's a Living (Canadian TV series)|It's a Living]]'', and ''[[CBC News: Disclosure|Disclosure]]''. Disclosure was canceled in 2003. [[Peter Mansbridge]], former a anchor of ''[[The National (CBC)|The National]]'', began his career at CBWT.\n\n==Programming==\nCBWT is CBC Television's [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] for the [[Central Time Zone]], airing the main CBC schedule one hour after the CBC Television stations in the [[Eastern Time Zone]] (for example, ''The National'' airs at 10 p.m. ET on [[CBLT-DT]]/Toronto and 10 p.m. CT on CBWT). This is different from the other Canadian television networks, whose stations in the Eastern and Central time zones air programs simultaneously in both time zones.\n\n''[[CBC News: Country Canada|Country Canada]]'', ''CountryWide'' and a local edition of ''[[CBC News at Six]]'' (formerly the local segment of ''[[Canada Now|CBC News: Canada Now]]'' from 2000 to 2006 and ''[[24Hours]]'' from October 5, 1970 to 2000) have been produced out of CBWT. In addition, ''The National'' has an investigative unit based at the station.\n\n===Local programming===\n''Country Canada'' was one of the longest running programs in Canadian television history and is broadcast nationally. It began as ''Country Calendar'' in 1954. The program name was carried over to a new digital [[specialty channel]] called [[CBC Country Canada]], which first launched in September 2001. ''Spotlight'' was one of CBWT's first news interview programs, which aired Monday through Saturdays between 7:15 and 7:30&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{cite news | title = Here's A Week Of TV Viewing | newspaper = Winnipeg Free Press | date = June 2, 1954}}</ref>\n\n''3's Company'' was a local program broadcast in the early 1960s and was similar to ''Living Winnipeg''. The title was a play on both the number of on-air hosts (Mary Liz Bayer, Bill Guest, Jose Poneira), and the channel that CBWT had broadcast on in Winnipeg at the time.<ref>{{cite news | title = February 1961 National Electrical Week | newspaper = Winnipeg Free Press | page = 12 | date = February 6, 1961}}</ref> However, Bayer became the host of her own show, ''The Mary Liz Show'', one year earlier. ''The Medicine Show'' was a local production shown nationally, which ran from January 1980 to August 1982. ''Show Business'', hosted by Tom McCulloch, and ''Ten O'Clock Live'', a music program from a local bar, were two local programs produced by CBWT in 1981.<ref>{{cite news | first = Randal | last = McIlroy | title = Local TV is in 'slow lane' | newspaper = Winnipeg Free Press | page = 14 | date = May 9, 1981}}</ref>\n\n''In Search of the Perfect Summer'' was a summertime series produced by Sean Sullivan and was co-hosted by Anne Harding and Laurie Mustard in the 1982 season.

By 1989, the Winnipeg program was cancelled and amalgamated with the [[CBKT-DT|CBKT]] [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] version of ''Switchback'', where Winnipeg contributed a portion of the program content.\n\nThe end of regional non-news programming came in 2000\u201301, when ''Breakaway'', aired since June 1987<ref>{{cite news |title= Coleman new co-host for CBC's Breakaway |newspaper= Winnipeg Free Press |page= 33 |date= June 12, 1987}}</ref> and was co-hosted by Sandi Coleman, a program profiling different Manitoba towns<ref>{{cite news |title= Spirit of Breakaway rises: Coleman starts new series of folksy features |newspaper= Winnipeg Free Press |page= C7 |date= October 28, 1993}}</ref> was canceled in the last round of budget cuts to the CBC. Sandi now hosts the morning program on [[CFWH (AM)|CBC Radio One Yukon]].\n\nOn January 15, 2007, CBWT began airing its first regional (non-news) television program since 2000, ''[[Living (2007 TV program)|Living Winnipeg]]''. The program was seen weekdays at 3 p.m. and replayed at 3:30&nbsp;a.m. On March 26, 2009, the CBC announced that ''Living'' was being cancelled on all its stations.\n\n==News operation==\nCBWT-DT presently broadcasts 10 hours, 40 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with two hours each weekday, a half-hour on Saturdays and ten minutes on Sundays). Today, CBWT airs a 90-minute supper hour newscast from 5 to 6:30&nbsp;p.m. and a ten-minute late night summary at 11 p.m. on weeknights, and weekend evening newscasts on Saturdays at 5:30&nbsp;p.m. in the form of a half-hour newscast and Sundays at 11 p.m. in the form of a ten-minute bulletin.\n\nThe first big story CBWT covered happened on June 8, 1954, about one week after the station opened, where the Time Building at 333 Portage Avenue caught fire. The Time Building was across from the [[Eaton's]] building.\n\nAt one time, Western Manitoba Broadcasters (a subsidiary of [[Craig Media]]) and CBC Manitoba had an agreement where the Dauphin retransmitter (CBWST 8) would carry a local newscast in place of the Winnipeg one.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1989/db89-114.htm|title=CRTC Decision 89\u2013114|date=April 6, 1989}}</ref> The program was called ''IMTV The Report'' and was broadcast at 5:30 PM.

Later on, CBTA in Lynn Lake became part of the ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation#Frontier Coverage Package|Frontier Coverage Package]]'' in September 1967.

Strike action began at 10:30 p.m. on May 3, 1981.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBC Struck, pickets out in Winnipeg|newspaper= Winnipeg Free Press|pages=1, 4|date= May 4, 1981}}</ref> Shortly after the [[Brian Mulroney|Mulroney]] government came to power in 1984, they made major cuts to the CBC, and as a result, 86 staff members were let go at CBWT.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBC Manitoba loses 86 staff jobs in province|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|date=December 12, 1984}}</ref> There was a second round of major cuts in December 1990, which had a negative effect on local production, especially on the resources of ''24Hours''.\n\nOn February 27, 1997, CBC Manitoba announced that it would update and expand by {{convert|2,700|m2|sqft|0}} its studio facilities for the cost of $2.8 million.<ref>{{cite news|first= Glen|last=MacKenzie|title=CBC to erect new quarters, combine into two buildings|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|page=A4|date=January 27, 1997}}</ref> In 1998, CBC Manitoba's newsroom and studios were expanded into a new building, after essentially using portables and an abandoned church as its news operations for many years. The television studio now features a window looking down onto [[Portage Avenue|Portage]]. A new digital [[Betacam SX]] format was introduced, one of the first CBC stations to transition to make use of it. The first television broadcast from the new studio occurred on Monday, September 21, 1998.\n\nPrevious programs produced at CBWT include ''[[Fred Penner's Place]]'', ''[[It's a Living (Canadian TV series)|It's a Living]]'', and ''[[CBC News: Disclosure|Disclosure]]''. Disclosure was canceled in 2003. [[Peter Mansbridge]], former a anchor of ''[[The National (CBC)|The National]]'', began his career at CBWT.\n\n==Programming==\nCBWT is CBC Television's [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] for the [[Central Time Zone]], airing the main CBC schedule one hour after the CBC Television stations in the [[Eastern Time Zone]] (for example, ''The National'' airs at 10 p.m. ET on [[CBLT-DT]]/Toronto and 10 p.m. CT on CBWT). This is different from the other Canadian television networks, whose stations in the Eastern and Central time zones air programs simultaneously in both time zones.\n\n''[[CBC News: Country Canada|Country Canada]]'', ''CountryWide'' and a local edition of ''[[CBC News at Six]]'' (formerly the local segment of ''[[Canada Now|CBC News: Canada Now]]'' from 2000 to 2006 and ''[[24Hours]]'' from October 5, 1970 to 2000) have been produced out of CBWT. In addition ''The National'' has an investigative unit based at the station.\n\n===Local programming===\n''Country Canada'' was one of the longest running programs in Canadian television history, and is broadcast nationally. It began as ''Country Calendar'' in 1954. The program name was carried over to a new digital [[specialty channel]] called [[CBC Country Canada]], which first launched in September 2001. ''Spotlight'' was one of CBWT's first news interview programs, which aired Monday through Saturdays between 7:15 and 7:30&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{cite news | title = Here's A Week Of TV Viewing | newspaper = Winnipeg Free Press | date = June 2, 1954}}</ref>\n\n''3's Company'' was a local program broadcast in the early 1960s and was similar to ''Living Winnipeg''. The title was a play on both the number of on-air hosts (Mary Liz Bayer, Bill Guest, Jose Poneira), and the channel that CBWT had broadcast on in Winnipeg at the time.<ref>{{cite news | title = February 1961 National Electrical Week | newspaper = Winnipeg Free Press | page = 12 | date = February 6, 1961}}</ref> However, Bayer became host of her own show, ''The Mary Liz Show'', one year earlier. ''The Medicine Show'' was a local production shown nationally, which ran from January 1980 to August 1982. ''Show Business'', hosted by Tom McCulloch, and ''Ten O'Clock Live'', a music program from a local bar, were two local programs produced by CBWT in 1981.<ref>{{cite news | first = Randal | last = McIlroy | title = Local TV is in 'slow lane' | newspaper = Winnipeg Free Press | page = 14 | date = May 9, 1981}}</ref>\n\n''In Search of the Perfect Summer'' was a summertime series produced by Sean Sullivan and was co-hosted by Anne Harding and Laurie Mustard in the 1982 season. It was nominated ''Best Variety Program on Television'' in the (2nd annual) 1982 Winnipeg Broadcast Awards.<ref>{{cite news |first= Marilyn |last= MacKinnon |title= Broadcast awards nominees selected|newspaper= Winnipeg Free Press |page= 17 |date= September 27, 1982}}</ref> Mustard won ''Best Host/Interviewer'' for the series.<ref>{{cite news |first= Marilyn |last= MacKinnon|title= Awards show goes on despite technical snafus |newspaper= Winnipeg Free Press |page= 31 |date= October 6, 1982}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1983 and 1986, Laurie Mustard hosted a Sunday morning local program for kids called ''Switchback'', which was the title used for similar programs across the main CBC network. By 1989, the Winnipeg program was cancelled and amalgamated with the [[CBKT-DT|CBKT]] [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] version of ''Switchback'', where Winnipeg contributed a portion of the program content.\n\nThe end of regional non-news programming came in 2000\u201301, when ''Breakaway'', aired since June 1987<ref>{{cite news |title= Coleman new co-host for CBC's Breakaway |newspaper= Winnipeg Free Press |page= 33 |date= June 12, 1987}}</ref> and was co-hosted by Sandi Coleman, a program profiling different Manitoba towns<ref>{{cite news |title= Spirit of Breakaway rises: Coleman starts new series of folksy features |newspaper= Winnipeg Free Press |page= C7 |date= October 28, 1993}}</ref> was canceled in the last round of budget cuts to the CBC. Sandi now hosts the morning program on [[CFWH (AM)|CBC Radio One Yukon]].\n\nOn January 15, 2007, CBWT began airing its first regional (non-news) television program since 2000, ''[[Living (2007 TV program)|Living Winnipeg]]''. The program was seen weekdays at 3 p.m. and replayed at 3:30&nbsp;a.m. On March 26, 2009, the CBC announced that ''Living'' was being cancelled on all its stations.\n\n==News operation==\nCBWT-DT presently broadcasts 10 hours, 40 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with two hours each weekday, a half-hour on Saturdays and ten minutes on Sundays). Today, CBWT airs a 90-minute supper hour newscast from 5 to 6:30&nbsp;p.m. and a ten-minute late night summary at 11 p.m. on weeknights, and weekend evening newscasts on Saturdays at 5:30&nbsp;p.m. in the form of a half-hour newscast and Sundays at 11 p.m. in the form of a ten-minute bulletin.\n\nThe first big story CBWT covered happened on June 8, 1954, about one week after the station opened, where the Time Building at 333 Portage Avenue caught fire. The Time Building was across from the [[Eaton's]] building.\n\nAt one time, Western Manitoba Broadcasters (a subsidiary of [[Craig Media]]) and CBC Manitoba had an agreement where the Dauphin retransmitter (CBWST 8) would carry a local newscast in place of the Winnipeg one.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1989/db89-114.htm|title=CRTC Decision 89\u2013114|date=April 6, 1989}}</ref> The program was called ''IMTV The Report'' and was broadcast at 5:30 PM.

Due to federal funding reductions to the CBC, in April 2012, the CBC responded with substantial budget cuts, which included shutting down CBC's and Radio-Canada's remaining analog transmitters on July 31, 2012.<ref>[http://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/media-centre/2012/04/04/ Speaking notes for Hubert T.

Later on, CBTA in Lynn Lake became part of the ''[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation#Frontier Coverage Package|Frontier Coverage Package]]'' in September 1967.
