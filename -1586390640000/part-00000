''El ritmo en bolero: el bolero en la musica bailable cubana''. Huracan, Rio Piedras P.R. p249</ref>\n\n:(The adaptation and fusion of the bolero with other types of popular dance music has contributed to their development, and to its endurance and timelessness.)\n\nThis adaptability was largely achieved by dispensing with limitations in format or instrumentation, and by an increase in syncopation (so producing a more afrocuban sound). Examples would be:\n*Bolero in the ''danz\u00f3n'': the advent of lyrics in the danz\u00f3n to produce the ''danzonete''.\n*The ''bolero-son'': long-time favourite dance music in Cuba, captured abroad under the misnomer 'rumba'.\n*The ''bolero-mambo'' in which slow and beautiful lyrics were added to the sophisticated big-band arrangements of the mambo.\n*The ''bolero-cha'': many cha-cha-cha lyrics come from boleros.\n\nThe lyrics of the bolero can be found throughout popular music, especially Latin dance music.\n\n== Vietnam ==\nBolero music has also spread to [[Vietnam]]. In the 1930s, the nation grew fond of modern music, which combined Western elements with traditional music. Vietnamese bolero is generally slower tempo compared to Latin bolero, and partially-influenced by [[Music of Japan|Japanese]] [[enka]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Theo Ti\u1ec1n Phong|title=Tr\u00ed th\u1ee9c c\u0169ng nghe nh\u1ea1c v\u00e0ng|url=http://www.thanhnien.com.vn/van-hoa-nghe-thuat/tri-thuc-cung-nghe-nhac-vang-181742.html|accessdate=3 November 2017|language=Vietnamese|date=26 August 2010|quote=Bolero Vi\u1ec7t Nam r\u1ea5t ch\u1eadm.}}</ref> Such music was romantic, expressing concepts of feelings, love, and life in a poetic language;<ref name=\"vnn\">{{cite web|last1=Ch\u00e1nh|first1=Minh|title=Bolero \u2013 m\u1ed9t l\u1ecbch s\u1eed t\u00ecnh ca|url=http://vietnamnet.vn/vn/giai-tri/bolero-mot-lich-su-tinh-ca-67870.html|website=VietnamNet|accessdate=2 November 2017|language=Vietnamese|date=12 April 2012}}</ref> this predisposition was hated by [[Viet Minh]], who strived towards shaping the working class at the time.<ref name=\"diplomat\">{{cite news|title=The Revival of Bol\u00e9ro in Vietnam|last=Duy|first=Dinh|url=https://thediplomat.com/2016/10/the-revival-of-bolero-in-vietnam/|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=[[The Diplomat]]|publisher=The Diplomat|date=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThis genre became colloquially known as ''[[Yellow Music#Vietnam|yellow music]]'', in opposition to the ''red music'' endorsed by the Communist government of [[Hanoi]] during the era of the [[Vietnam War]].  As a result of [[North Vietnam]] winning the war, the music was banned in 1975. Those caught listening to ''yellow music'' would be punished, and their music confiscated. After the [[Fall of Saigon]], many Vietnamese migrated to the United States, taking their music with them. The ban was lightened in 1986, when love songs could be written again, but by then the music industry was killed.<ref name=\"diplomat\"/>\n\nThe government of Vietnam also prohibited the sale of overseas Vietnamese music, including variety shows like ''Asia'' and ''[[Paris by Night]]''.

This came about in the early 1930s when a simple overall term was needed to market Cuban music to audiences unfamiliar with the various Cuban musical terms. The famous ''[[Peanut Vendor]]'' was so labelled, and the label stuck for other types of Cuban music.<ref>Diaz Ayala, Cristobal 1981.

The music has a gentle Cuban rhythm related to a slow ''[[Son Cubano|son]]'', which is the reason it may be best described as a bolero-son. Like some other Cuban dances, there are three steps to four beats, with the first step of a figure on the second beat, not the first. The ''slow'' (over the two beats four and one) is executed with a hip movement over the standing foot, with no foot-flick.<ref>Lavelle, Doris 1983. ''Latin & American dances''. 3rd ed, Black, London.</ref>\n\n=== American Rhythm ===\nThe dance known as bolero is  one of the [[competition dance]]s in [[American Rhythm]] ballroom dance category. The first step is typically taken on the first beat, held during the second beat with two more steps falling on beats three and four (cued as \"slow-quick-quick\").  In competitive dance the music is in {{music|time|4|4}} time and will range between 96 and 104 bpm. This dance is quite different from the other American Rhythm dances in that it not only requires [[cuban motion]] but [[rises and falls]] such as found in [[waltz]] and [[contra body movement]].<ref>W.D.

He was a close friend of [[Pauline Viardot]], the daughter of the famed Spanish tenor [[Manuel Garc\u00eda (tenor)|Manuel Garc\u00eda]], who had introduced the bolero to Paris\n* [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]] wrote a bolero in ''La Soir\u00e9e dans Grenade''\n* [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]] wrote a bolero in ''[[Carmen]]''\n* [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]] wrote a bolero, ''El desdichado'', for 2 voices and orchestra\n* [[Moritz Moszkowski|Moszkowski]]'s first set of Spanish Dances (Op. 12) ends with a bolero.\n* [[Louis James Alfred Lef\u00e9bure-W\u00e9ly|Lef\u00e9bure-W\u00e9ly]] wrote ''Bol\u00e9ro de Concert'' for organ\n* The bolero from [[Herv\u00e9 (composer)|Herv\u00e9]]'s ''[[Chilp\u00e9ric (operetta)|Chilp\u00e9ric]]'' has been immortalized in [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]]'s famous painting (above).\n* [[Friedrich Baumfelder]] wrote a Premier Bolero, Op. 317, for piano.\n* [[Richard Aaker Trythall]] wrote a bolero for four percussionists based on the rhythm and structure of the traditional bolero dance. Trythall imagined the four percussionists as four dancers, intertwining their solos, duets, and trios with moments of group ensemble work in the same way a choreographer might have done.\n* [[Charles-Auguste de Beriot]] wrote a bolero in his concerto \"Scene de Ballet\" for violin and piano (or orchestra).\n* English banjo composer [[Joe Morley]] wrote a bolero titled \"El Contrabandista\" after noted banjoist and composer Alfred Cammeyer published a bolero in {{music|time|4|4}} time for banjo.  Morley composed his as a true bolero in {{music|time|3|4}} time.\n* [[John Serry Sr.]] composed his ''African Bolero'' for accordion and flute in 1950.\n* [[Fumio Hayasaka]] composed a bolero for the [[Akira Kurosawa]] film ''[[Rashomon]]'' in 1950.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n* [[Keith Emerson]] composed his ''Abaddon's Bolero'' for Orchestra and Synthesizer in 1972.\n\nIn some art music boleros, the root lies not in the bolero but in the [[Habanera (music)|habanera]], a Cuban precursor of the [[History of Tango|tango]], which was a favourite dance rhythm in the mid-19th century, and occurs often in French [[opera]] and Spanish [[zarzuela]] of the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>Loyola Fern\u00e1ndez, Jose 1997.

Untrained, but with remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost, but two dozen or so survive because friends and students wrote them down. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed.<ref>Orovio, Helio 2004. ''Cuban music from A to Z.'' p195.</ref><ref>Orovio, Helio 1995. ''El bolero latino''.

''El ritmo en bolero: el bolero en la musica bailable cubana''. Huracan, Rio Piedras P.R. p249</ref>\n\n:(The adaptation and fusion of the bolero with other types of popular dance music has contributed to their development, and to its endurance and timelessness.)\n\nThis adaptability was largely achieved by dispensing with limitations in format or instrumentation, and by an increase in syncopation (so producing a more afrocuban sound). Examples would be:\n*Bolero in the ''danz\u00f3n'': the advent of lyrics in the danz\u00f3n to produce the ''danzonete''.\n*The ''bolero-son'': long-time favourite dance music in Cuba, captured abroad under the misnomer 'rumba'.\n*The ''bolero-mambo'' in which slow and beautiful lyrics were added to the sophisticated big-band arrangements of the mambo.\n*The ''bolero-cha'': many cha-cha-cha lyrics come from boleros.\n\nThe lyrics of the bolero can be found throughout popular music, especially Latin dance music.\n\n== Vietnam ==\nBolero music has also spread to [[Vietnam]]. In the 1930s, the nation grew fond of modern music, which combined Western elements with traditional music. Vietnamese bolero is generally slower tempo compared to Latin bolero, and partially-influenced by [[Music of Japan|Japanese]] [[enka]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Theo Ti\u1ec1n Phong|title=Tr\u00ed th\u1ee9c c\u0169ng nghe nh\u1ea1c v\u00e0ng|url=http://www.thanhnien.com.vn/van-hoa-nghe-thuat/tri-thuc-cung-nghe-nhac-vang-181742.html|accessdate=3 November 2017|language=Vietnamese|date=26 August 2010|quote=Bolero Vi\u1ec7t Nam r\u1ea5t ch\u1eadm.}}</ref> Such music was romantic, expressing concepts of feelings, love, and life in a poetic language;<ref name=\"vnn\">{{cite web|last1=Ch\u00e1nh|first1=Minh|title=Bolero \u2013 m\u1ed9t l\u1ecbch s\u1eed t\u00ecnh ca|url=http://vietnamnet.vn/vn/giai-tri/bolero-mot-lich-su-tinh-ca-67870.html|website=VietnamNet|accessdate=2 November 2017|language=Vietnamese|date=12 April 2012}}</ref> this predisposition was hated by [[Viet Minh]], who strived towards shaping the working class at the time.<ref name=\"diplomat\">{{cite news|title=The Revival of Bol\u00e9ro in Vietnam|last=Duy|first=Dinh|url=https://thediplomat.com/2016/10/the-revival-of-bolero-in-vietnam/|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=[[The Diplomat]]|publisher=The Diplomat|date=12 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThis genre became colloquially known as ''[[Yellow Music#Vietnam|yellow music]]'', in opposition to the ''red music'' endorsed by the Communist government of [[Hanoi]] during the era of the [[Vietnam War]].  As a result of [[North Vietnam]] winning the war, the music was banned in 1975. Those caught listening to ''yellow music'' would be punished, and their music confiscated. After the [[Fall of Saigon]], many Vietnamese migrated to the United States, taking their music with them. The ban was lightened in 1986, when love songs could be written again, but by then the music industry was killed.<ref name=\"diplomat\"/>\n\nThe government of Vietnam also prohibited the sale of overseas Vietnamese music, including variety shows like ''Asia'' and ''[[Paris by Night]]''. In recent years however, bolero had grown popular again, as more overseas singers performed in Vietnam. Additionally, singing competition television series like ''Bol\u00e9ro Idol'' have grown popular, with singers performing songs, including songs formerly banned.<ref name=\"diplomat\"/>\n\n== Ballroom dance ==\n{{Main|Rhumba}}\n\n=== International ballroom ===\nA version of the Cuban bolero is danced throughout the [[Latin dance]] world (supervised by the [[World Dance Council]]) under the misnomer '[[Rhumba|rumba]]'. This came about in the early 1930s when a simple overall term was needed to market Cuban music to audiences unfamiliar with the various Cuban musical terms. The famous ''[[Peanut Vendor]]'' was so labelled, and the label stuck for other types of Cuban music.<ref>Diaz Ayala, Cristobal 1981.

Chapter 27 The Peanut Vendor.</ref>\n\nIn Cuba, the bolero is usually written in {{music|time|2|4}} time, elsewhere often {{music|time|4|4}}. The tempo for dance is about 120 beats per minute. The music has a gentle Cuban rhythm related to a slow ''[[Son Cubano|son]]'', which is the reason it may be best described as a bolero-son. Like some other Cuban dances, there are three steps to four beats, with the first step of a figure on the second beat, not the first. The ''slow'' (over the two beats four and one) is executed with a hip movement over the standing foot, with no foot-flick.<ref>Lavelle, Doris 1983. ''Latin & American dances''. 3rd ed, Black, London.</ref>\n\n=== American Rhythm ===\nThe dance known as bolero is  one of the [[competition dance]]s in [[American Rhythm]] ballroom dance category. The first step is typically taken on the first beat, held during the second beat with two more steps falling on beats three and four (cued as \"slow-quick-quick\").  In competitive dance the music is in {{music|time|4|4}} time and will range between 96 and 104 bpm. This dance is quite different from the other American Rhythm dances in that it not only requires [[cuban motion]] but [[rises and falls]] such as found in [[waltz]] and [[contra body movement]].<ref>W.D.

She was known in [[Latin]] as ''Mathildis Imperatrix'' and in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] as ''Imperatrice Mahaut''.|group=\"nb\"}} was one of the claimants to the English throne during the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]]. The daughter of [[King Henry I of England]], she moved to Germany as a child when she married the future [[Holy Roman Emperor Henry V]]. She travelled with her husband into Italy in 1116, was controversially crowned in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basilica]], and acted as the imperial [[regent]] in Italy. Matilda and Henry V had no children, and when he died in 1125, the imperial crown was claimed by his rival [[Lothair of Supplinburg]].\n\nMeanwhile, Matilda's younger brother, [[William Adelin]], died in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, leaving Matilda's father and England facing a potential succession crisis. On Emperor Henry V's death, Matilda was recalled to [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] by her father, who arranged for her to marry [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] to form an alliance to protect his southern borders. Henry I had no further legitimate children and nominated Matilda as his heir, making his court swear an [[oath]] of loyalty to her and her successors, but the decision was not popular in the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] court. Henry died in 1135, but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from Anglo-Norman barons. The throne was instead taken by Matilda's cousin [[Stephen of Blois]], who enjoyed the backing of the [[Christianity in England|English Church]]. Stephen took steps to solidify his new regime but faced threats both from neighbouring powers and from opponents within his kingdom.\n\nIn 1139, Matilda crossed to England to take the kingdom by force, supported by her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]] and her uncle [[King David I of Scotland]], while Geoffrey focused on conquering Normandy. Matilda's forces captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]] in 1141, but the Empress' attempt to be crowned at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] collapsed in the face of bitter opposition from the London crowds. As a result of this retreat, Matilda was never formally declared Queen of England, and was instead titled \"Lady of the English\". ({{Lang-la|[[dominus (title)|domina]] Anglorum}}.) Robert was captured following the [[Rout of Winchester]] in 1141, and Matilda agreed to exchange him for Stephen. Matilda became trapped in [[Oxford Castle]] by Stephen's forces that winter, and to avoid capture was forced to escape at night across the frozen [[River Isis]] to [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], reputedly wearing white as camouflage in the snow. The war degenerated into a stalemate, with Matilda controlling much of the south-west of England, and Stephen the south-east and the Midlands. Large parts of the rest of the country were in the hands of local, independent barons.\n\nMatilda returned to Normandy, now in the hands of her husband, in 1148, leaving her eldest son to continue the campaign in England; he eventually succeeded to the throne as [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1154, forming the [[Angevin Empire]]. She settled her court near [[Rouen]] and for the rest of her life concerned herself with the administration of Normandy, acting on her son's behalf when necessary. Particularly in the early years of her son's reign, she provided political advice and attempted to mediate during the [[Becket controversy]]. She worked extensively with the Church, founding [[Cistercian]] monasteries, and was known for her piety. She was buried under the high altar at [[Bec Abbey]] after her death in 1167.\n\n==Childhood==\nMatilda was born to [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], King of England and [[Duke of Normandy]], and his first wife, [[Matilda of Scotland]], possibly around 7 February 1102 at [[Sutton Courtenay]], in Berkshire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>{{refn|Matilda's date of birth was not recorded at the time and can only be estimated by later chronicler statements about her age. Older histories suggested that Matilda of Scotland gave birth to a child in the city of Winchester in July 1101. These were based on the writings of the chronicler [[Wace]]; current scholarship, based on the records of the Queen's travels, considers this account to have been impossible, and places Matilda of Scotland at Sutton Courtenay in early February 1102, where the Empress Matilda was probably born.<ref name=\"Chibnall 1991 9\">{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|p=9}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}} Henry was the youngest son of [[William the Conqueror]], who had invaded England in 1066, creating an empire stretching into Wales.

Matilda's father, Henry, had a considerable sexual appetite and enjoyed a substantial number of sexual partners, resulting in a large number of illegitimate children, at least nine sons and 13 daughters, many of whom he appears to have recognised and supported.<ref name=\"Chibnall 1991 9\"/>|group=\"nb\"}} Little is known about Matilda's earliest life, but she probably stayed with her mother, was taught to read, and was educated in religious morals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=9\u201310}};

She was known in [[Latin]] as ''Mathildis Imperatrix'' and in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] as ''Imperatrice Mahaut''.|group=\"nb\"}} was one of the claimants to the English throne during the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]]. The daughter of [[King Henry I of England]], she moved to Germany as a child when she married the future [[Holy Roman Emperor Henry V]]. She travelled with her husband into Italy in 1116, was controversially crowned in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's Basilica]], and acted as the imperial [[regent]] in Italy. Matilda and Henry V had no children, and when he died in 1125, the imperial crown was claimed by his rival [[Lothair of Supplinburg]].\n\nMeanwhile, Matilda's younger brother, [[William Adelin]], died in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, leaving Matilda's father and England facing a potential succession crisis. On Emperor Henry V's death, Matilda was recalled to [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] by her father, who arranged for her to marry [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] to form an alliance to protect his southern borders. Henry I had no further legitimate children and nominated Matilda as his heir, making his court swear an [[oath]] of loyalty to her and her successors, but the decision was not popular in the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] court. Henry died in 1135, but Matilda and Geoffrey faced opposition from Anglo-Norman barons. The throne was instead taken by Matilda's cousin [[Stephen of Blois]], who enjoyed the backing of the [[Christianity in England|English Church]]. Stephen took steps to solidify his new regime but faced threats both from neighbouring powers and from opponents within his kingdom.\n\nIn 1139, Matilda crossed to England to take the kingdom by force, supported by her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Robert of Gloucester]] and her uncle [[King David I of Scotland]], while Geoffrey focused on conquering Normandy. Matilda's forces captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|Battle of Lincoln]] in 1141, but the Empress' attempt to be crowned at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]] collapsed in the face of bitter opposition from the London crowds. As a result of this retreat, Matilda was never formally declared Queen of England, and was instead titled \"Lady of the English\". ({{Lang-la|[[dominus (title)|domina]] Anglorum}}.) Robert was captured following the [[Rout of Winchester]] in 1141, and Matilda agreed to exchange him for Stephen. Matilda became trapped in [[Oxford Castle]] by Stephen's forces that winter, and to avoid capture was forced to escape at night across the frozen [[River Isis]] to [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], reputedly wearing white as camouflage in the snow. The war degenerated into a stalemate, with Matilda controlling much of the south-west of England, and Stephen the south-east and the Midlands. Large parts of the rest of the country were in the hands of local, independent barons.\n\nMatilda returned to Normandy, now in the hands of her husband, in 1148, leaving her eldest son to continue the campaign in England; he eventually succeeded to the throne as [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] in 1154, forming the [[Angevin Empire]]. She settled her court near [[Rouen]] and for the rest of her life concerned herself with the administration of Normandy, acting on her son's behalf when necessary. Particularly in the early years of her son's reign, she provided political advice and attempted to mediate during the [[Becket controversy]]. She worked extensively with the Church, founding [[Cistercian]] monasteries, and was known for her piety. She was buried under the high altar at [[Bec Abbey]] after her death in 1167.\n\n==Childhood==\nMatilda was born to [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], King of England and [[Duke of Normandy]], and his first wife, [[Matilda of Scotland]], possibly around 7 February 1102 at [[Sutton Courtenay]], in Berkshire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chibnall|1991|pp=8\u20139}}</ref>{{refn|Matilda's date of birth was not recorded at the time and can only be estimated by later chronicler statements about her age.

The [[SI]] unit of luminous intensity is the [[candela]]&nbsp;(cd), an [[SI base unit]].\n\nPhotometry deals with the measurement of visible light as perceived by human eyes. The human eye can only see light in the [[visible spectrum]] and has different sensitivities to [[light]] of different wavelengths within the spectrum. When adapted for bright conditions ([[photopic vision]]), the eye is most sensitive to greenish-yellow light at 555&nbsp;nm. Light with the same [[radiant intensity]] at other wavelengths has a lower luminous intensity. The curve which measures the response of the human eye to light is a defined standard, known as the [[luminosity function]]. This curve, denoted ''V''(&lambda;) or <math>\\textstyle \\overline{y}(\\lambda)</math>, is based on an average of widely differing experimental data from scientists using different measurement techniques. For instance, the measured responses of the eye to violet light varied by a factor of ten.{{Citation needed|reason=Which study showed this?|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Relationship to other measures==\nLuminous intensity should not be confused with another photometric unit, [[luminous flux]], which is the total perceived power emitted in all directions. Luminous intensity is the perceived power ''per unit solid angle''. If a lamp has a 1 lumen bulb and the optics of the lamp are set up to focus the light evenly into a 1 [[steradian]] beam, then the beam would have a luminous intensity of 1 candela. If the optics were changed to concentrate the beam into 1/2 steradian then the source would have a luminous intensity of 2 candela. The resulting beam is narrower and brighter, though its luminous flux remains unchanged.\n\nLuminous intensity is also not the same as the [[radiant intensity]], the corresponding objective [[physical quantity]] used in the measurement science of [[radiometry]].\n\n==Units==\nLike other SI base units, the candela has an [[operational definition]]&mdash;it is defined by the description of a physical process that will produce one candela of luminous intensity. By definition, if one constructs a light source that emits monochromatic green light with a frequency of 540&nbsp;THz, and that has a radiant intensity of 1/683&nbsp;[[watt]]s per [[steradian]] in a given direction, that light source will emit one candela in the specified direction.<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Base unit definitions: Candela\n | work = The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty\n | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/candela.html\n | accessdate = 8 February 2008\n }}</ref>\n\nThe frequency of light used in the definition corresponds to a wavelength in a vacuum of 555&nbsp;nm, which is near the peak of the eye's response to light. If the source emitted uniformly in all directions, the total [[radiant flux]] would be about 18.40&nbsp;mW, since there are 4&pi;&nbsp;steradians in a sphere. A typical candle produces very roughly one candela of luminous intensity.\n\nPrior to the definition of the candela, a variety of units for luminous intensity were used in various countries. These were typically based on the brightness of the flame from a \"standard candle\" of defined composition, or the brightness of an incandescent filament of specific design. One of the best-known of these standards was the [[England|English]] standard: [[candlepower]]. One candlepower was the light produced by a pure [[spermaceti]] candle weighing one sixth of a pound and burning at a rate of 120&nbsp;[[Grain (mass)|grains]] per hour.

The [[SI]] unit of luminous intensity is the [[candela]]&nbsp;(cd), an [[SI base unit]].\n\nPhotometry deals with the measurement of visible light as perceived by human eyes. The human eye can only see light in the [[visible spectrum]] and has different sensitivities to [[light]] of different wavelengths within the spectrum. When adapted for bright conditions ([[photopic vision]]), the eye is most sensitive to greenish-yellow light at 555&nbsp;nm. Light with the same [[radiant intensity]] at other wavelengths has a lower luminous intensity. The curve which measures the response of the human eye to light is a defined standard, known as the [[luminosity function]]. This curve, denoted ''V''(&lambda;) or <math>\\textstyle \\overline{y}(\\lambda)</math>, is based on an average of widely differing experimental data from scientists using different measurement techniques. For instance, the measured responses of the eye to violet light varied by a factor of ten {{Citation needed|reason=Which study showed this?|date=February 2018}} .\n\n==Relationship to other measures==\nLuminous intensity should not be confused with another photometric unit, [[luminous flux]], which is the total perceived power emitted in all directions. Luminous intensity is the perceived power ''per unit solid angle''. If a lamp has a 1 lumen bulb and the optics of the lamp are set up to focus the light evenly into a 1 [[steradian]] beam, then the beam would have a luminous intensity of 1 candela. If the optics were changed to concentrate the beam into 1/2 steradian then the source would have a luminous intensity of 2 candela. The resulting beam is narrower and brighter, though its luminous flux remains unchanged.\n\nLuminous intensity is also not the same as the [[radiant intensity]], the corresponding objective [[physical quantity]] used in the measurement science of [[radiometry]].\n\n==Units==\nLike other SI base units, the candela has an [[operational definition]]&mdash;it is defined by the description of a physical process that will produce one candela of luminous intensity. By definition, if one constructs a light source that emits monochromatic green light with a frequency of 540&nbsp;THz, and that has a radiant intensity of 1/683&nbsp;[[watt]]s per [[steradian]] in a given direction, that light source will emit one candela in the specified direction.<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Base unit definitions: Candela\n | work = The NIST Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty\n | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/candela.html\n | accessdate = 8 February 2008\n }}</ref>\n\nThe frequency of light used in the definition corresponds to a wavelength in a vacuum of 555&nbsp;nm, which is near the peak of the eye's response to light. If the source emitted uniformly in all directions, the total [[radiant flux]] would be about 18.40&nbsp;mW, since there are 4&pi;&nbsp;steradians in a sphere. A typical candle produces very roughly one candela of luminous intensity.\n\nPrior to the definition of the candela, a variety of units for luminous intensity were used in various countries. These were typically based on the brightness of the flame from a \"standard candle\" of defined composition, or the brightness of an incandescent filament of specific design. One of the best-known of these standards was the [[England|English]] standard: [[candlepower]]. One candlepower was the light produced by a pure [[spermaceti]] candle weighing one sixth of a pound and burning at a rate of 120&nbsp;[[Grain (mass)|grains]] per hour. Germany, Austria, and Scandinavia used the [[Hefnerkerze]], a unit based on the output of a [[Hefner lamp]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/hefner.htm |title=Hefner unit, or Hefner candle |work=Sizes.com |date=30 May 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}</ref> In 1881, [[Jules Violle]] proposed the ''[[Violle]]'' as a unit of luminous intensity, and it was notable as the first unit of light intensity that did not depend on the properties of a particular lamp.
