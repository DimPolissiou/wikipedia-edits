That led to changes in salinity.<ref name=Pie\u00f1kowskiFACIES/> The Drzewica Formation was influenced by an ancient swampy-lagoonal sub-system, with Deltaic currents depositing fluvial sediments. The Main Boreholes show eustatic changes on the marine conditions, with a retreat of the sea level, leading to the appearance of vegetation and abundant pollen on the uppermost parts of the formation. The regressive phase of sea level is represented by the [[Komorowo Beds]] and\nUpper Slawecin Beds along with the Drzewica Formation. As the level of the sea recovered on the Toarcian, mostly of the setting turn out to be a bathial marine bottom.<ref>Feldman-Olszewska, A. (1997).

The regressive phase of sea level is represented by the [[Komorowo Beds]] and\nUpper Slawecin Beds along with the Drzewica Formation. As the level of the sea recovered on the Toarcian, mostly of the setting turn out to be a bathial marine bottom.<ref>Feldman-Olszewska, A. (1997).

In the 1850s Minnesota was on the [[American frontier]] and lacked trained teachers.  Winona settler Dr. John Ford lobbied the [[Minnesota Legislature]] to establish normal schools and rallied more than $5,000 in local donations to establish the state's first such institution.<ref name=Gaut>{{cite journal |last=Gaut |first=Greg |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Model School Building and College Hall of the Winona Normal School |url=http://www.mnhs.org/shpo/nrhp/docs_pdfs/0061_winonanormalschool.pdf |publisher=National Park Service |date=2013-05-17 |accessdate=2015-07-07}}</ref>  It was also the first tax-funded school west of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref name=History>{{cite web |title=Winona State History |url=http://www.winona.edu/history.asp |publisher=Winona State University |accessdate=2015-07-07}}</ref>\n\nClasses at the Winona Normal School began in September 1860, but the following year most of the male students as well as the principal and other staff left to serve in the [[American Civil War]].  The school closed in March 1862 due to the Civil War, then for another two years due to the [[Sioux]] War of 1862.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of St. Cloud Teachers College|last=Brainard|first=Dudley S.|publisher=St. Cloud State University|year=1953|isbn=|location=St. Cloud State University Institutional Repository|pages=3}}</ref> Its first class graduated in 1866.  The program soon added a [[laboratory school]] in which local children received education from faculty while students observed or, occasionally, led lessons themselves.  The normal school quickly outgrew its original four-room building, but state funding and local donations of money and a plot of land led to the construction of a proper facility in 1869.<ref name=Gaut />\n\nThe campus expanded with two new wings on \"Old Main\" in 1894, a library/gymnasium/kindergarten building\u2014Ogden Hall\u2014in 1909, and a women's dormitory\u2014Morey Hall\u2014in 1910.

Winona State University provides scholarship opportunities for International Students.\n\n'''Cross-Cultural Scholarship'''\n\nThe Cross-Cultural Scholarship offers International Students the ability to pay at the resident rate of tuition. Scholarship recipients share their culture with Americans as part of the requirement of the Cross-Cultural Outreach Program.\n\nThe Cross-Cultural Scholarship is available to all International students who qualify for admission at Winona State University and hold a F-1 Student Visa. These scholarships are equivalent to the difference between the resident rate of tuition and non-resident rate of tuition. Since tuition is based on a tuition band, the amount of the scholarship for the Academic Year of 2004 - 2005 is valued at an estimate of USD $4,534 based on 24 - 36 semester credits. Fall enrollees receive the scholarship for the academic year and Summer School. Spring Semester enrollees receive the scholarship for Spring Semester and Summer School.\n\nApplication And Renewal Process For Cross Cultural Scholarship\nProspective International Students are invited to apply for the Cross-Cultural Scholarship by completing the application. The application will be reviewed as soon as it is received and a decision will be made concerning your possible selection as a scholarship recipient. An award letter clarifying the details of the scholarship will accompany the I-20 form at the time of Admission. Renewing the scholarship for your second year at the University is a simple process by completing the following:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.winona.edu/international-services/ccs-scholarship.asp|title=International Services}}</ref>\n\n- Maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.50 (maximum length of scholarship is 9 semesters)\n\n- Maintain a valid F-1 or J-1 Immigration Status\n\n- Complete (3) Cross-Cultural Outreach projects during the academic year, starting in the fall and ending in the spring semester. These projects are called Minor Projects (2) and Major Project (1), for a total of three (3) projects.\n\nThe Cross-Cultural scholarship is a substantial source of savings for International Students.\n\n'''Presidential Honor Scholarship'''\n\nPresidential Honor Scholarships at Winona State University are designed especially for International Student freshmen with no transfer credits. Students must provide ORIGINAL TOEFL or SAT score to be eligible for the Presidential Honor Scholarship\n\nApplication And Renewal Process for the Presidential Honor Scholarship\nProspective International Students are invited to apply for the Presidential Honor Scholarship by completing the application.

In the 1850s Minnesota was on the [[American frontier]] and lacked trained teachers.

The program soon added a [[laboratory school]] in which local children received education from faculty while students observed or, occasionally, led lessons themselves.  The normal school quickly outgrew its original four-room building, but state funding and local donations of money and a plot of land led to the construction of a proper facility in 1869.<ref name=Gaut />\n\nThe campus expanded with two new wings on \"Old Main\" in 1894, a library/gymnasium/kindergarten building\u2014Ogden Hall\u2014in 1909, and a women's dormitory\u2014Morey Hall\u2014in 1910.

It is a member of the [[Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference]] for most sports, except for women's gymnastics ([[Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference]]).\n\nThe school's first national championship came in 1985 when the gymnastics team took the NAIA Gymnastics title, along with claiming four individual champions and 11 All-American honors, along with National Coach and Gymnast of the Year honors. That same year, the Warrior gymnastics team competed in the NCAA Division II nationals in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], taking home the third-place trophy, the first team at Winona State to compete in both affiliations at the national level. Again in 1987, the Warriors claimed the NAIA national title, this time paced by one individual champion and seven All-American honors.  Two gymnasts were also named Academic All-Americans for their outstanding academic achievements in the classroom. The National Coach of the Year award also went to the WSU head coach.\n\nIn the three years following, the gymnasts finished strong in the NCAA II regional competitions and managed to send individuals to the Division II nationals in 1986 (2) and 1987 (1). In 1989, the team represented the school at the Division II nationals in California after a record-breaking season.\n\nThe WSU football team won the NSIC conference championship ten times in a 15-year span (1993\u20132007). The Warriors have also appeared in postseason playoffs 5 times.  During the 1993 season they appeared n the NAIA I playoffs and in the NCAA II playoffs 2001, 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2017. They have also participated in the [[Mineral Water Bowl]] in 2000, 2002, and 2012.\n\nThe men's basketball team won the 2006 [[NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship]], the first NCAA title for the University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/recaps/d2_0325_63/2006 |title=NCAA.com \u2013 The Official Website of NCAA Championships |publisher=Ncaasports.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-14}}</ref>  On March 7, 2007, the Men's Basketball team won its 53rd consecutive regular or post season victory, beating the Division II mark set by [[Langston University]] of Oklahoma.

[[Paul Ginsparg]] recognized the need for central storage, and in August 1991 he created a central [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] mailbox stored at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) which could be accessed from any computer. Additional modes of access were soon added: [[FTP]] in 1991, [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] in 1992, and the [[World Wide Web]] in 1993.<ref name=\"dddmag2015\" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Ginsparg |first=Paul |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/35983 |title=The global-village pioneers |work=[[Physics World]] |date=October 1, 2008}}</ref> The term [[e-print]] was quickly adopted to describe the articles.\n\nIt began as a physics archive, called the [[LANL]] preprint archive, but soon expanded to include astronomy, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology and, most recently, statistics. Its original [[domain name]] was {{codett|xxx.lanl.gov}}.

Each member institution pledges a five-year funding commitment to support arXiv. Based on institutional usage ranking, the annual fees are set in four tiers from $1,000 to $4,400. Cornell's goal is to raise at least $504,000 per year through membership fees generated by approximately 220 institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://confluence.cornell.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=340900096|title=arXiv Member Institutions (2018) - arXiv public wiki - Dashboard|website=confluence.cornell.edu|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2011, Cornell University Library took overall administrative and financial responsibility for arXiv's operation and development.

[[Paul Ginsparg]] recognized the need for central storage, and in August 1991 he created a central [[Disciplinary repository|repository]] mailbox stored at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) which could be accessed from any computer. Additional modes of access were soon added: [[FTP]] in 1991, [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] in 1992, and the [[World Wide Web]] in 1993.<ref name=\"dddmag2015\" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Ginsparg |first=Paul |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/35983 |title=The global-village pioneers |work=[[Physics World]] |date=October 1, 2008}}</ref> The term [[e-print]] was quickly adopted to describe the articles.\n\nIt began as a physics archive, called the [[LANL]] preprint archive, but soon expanded to include astronomy, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology and, most recently, statistics. Its original [[domain name]] was {{codett|xxx.lanl.gov}}. Due to LANL's lack of interest in the rapidly expanding technology, in 2001 Ginsparg changed institutions to [[Cornell University]] and changed the name of the repository to {{codett|arXiv.org}}.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Butler | first = Declan\n | title = Los Alamos Loses Physics Archive as Preprint Pioneer Heads East\n | journal = Nature\n | date = July 5, 2001\n | pages = 3\u20134\n | volume = 412 | issue = 6842\n | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/debates/e-access/Articles/ginsparg.html\n | doi = 10.1038/35083708\n | pmid = 11452262\n | bibcode = 2001Natur.412....3B\n }}</ref> It is now hosted principally by Cornell, with five [[mirror website|mirrors]] around the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=arXiv mirror sites|url=https://arxiv.org/servers.html|publisher=arXiv|accessdate=April 6, 2020| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20200316205130/http://arxiv.org/help/mirrors| archivedate= March 16, 2020 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nIts existence was one of the precipitating factors that led to the current movement in [[scientific publishing]] known as [[open access (publishing)|open access]].

Ginsparg was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] in 2002 for his establishment of arXiv.\n\nThe annual budget for arXiv was approximately $826,000 for 2013 to 2017, funded jointly by Cornell University Library, the [[Simons Foundation]] (in both gift and challenge grant forms) and annual fee income from member institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://confluence.cornell.edu/download/attachments/127116484/arXiv+Business+Model.pdf |title=CORNELL UNIVERSITY LIBRARY ARXIV FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS FOR 2013-2017 |date=March 28, 2012 |website=Confluence.cornell.edu |accessdate=2017-02-26}}</ref>  This model arose in 2010, when Cornell sought to broaden the financial funding of the project by asking institutions to make annual voluntary contributions based on the amount of download usage by each institution. Each member institution pledges a five-year funding commitment to support arXiv. Based on institutional usage ranking, the annual fees are set in four tiers from $1,000 to $4,400. Cornell's goal is to raise at least $504,000 per year through membership fees generated by approximately 220 institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://confluence.cornell.edu/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=340900096|title=arXiv Member Institutions (2018) - arXiv public wiki - Dashboard|website=confluence.cornell.edu|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2011, Cornell University Library took overall administrative and financial responsibility for arXiv's operation and development.  Ginsparg was quoted in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' as saying it \"was supposed to be a three-hour tour, not a life sentence\".<ref name=\"CHE 2011\">{{cite news | url=http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/the-first-free-research-sharing-site-arxiv-turns-20/32778 | title=The First Free Research-Sharing Site, arXiv, Turns 20 With an Uncertain Future | work=Chronicle of Higher Education | date=August 10, 2011 | accessdate=August 12, 2011 | author=Fischman, Joah}}</ref>  However, Ginsparg remains on the <span class=\"plainlinks\">[https://arxiv.org/help/scientific_ad_board arXiv Scientific Advisory Board] and on the [https://arxiv.org/new/physics.html arXiv Physics Advisory Committee]</span>.\n\n== Moderation process and endorsement ==\nAlthough arXiv is not [[peer review]]ed, a collection of moderators for each area review the [[Electronic submission|submissions]]; they may recategorize any that are deemed off-topic,<ref name=\"mckinney\">{{citation|last=McKinney|first=Michelle|title=arXiv.org|journal=Reference Reviews|volume=25|issue=7|year=2011|pages=35\u201336|doi=10.1108/09504121111168622}}</ref> or reject submissions that are not scientific papers, or sometimes for undisclosed reasons.<ref name=Merali/> The lists of moderators for many sections of arXiv are publicly available,<ref>[https://arxiv.org/corr/subjectclasses Computing Research Repository Subject Areas and Moderators]; [http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/categories/math Mathematics categories]; [https://arxiv.org/new/stat.html Statistics archive]; [https://arxiv.org/new/q-bio.html Quantitative Biology archive]; [https://arxiv.org/new/physics.html Physics archive]</ref> but moderators for most of the physics sections remain unlisted.\n\nAdditionally, an \"endorsement\" system was introduced in 2004 as part of an effort to ensure content is relevant and of interest to current research in the specified disciplines.<ref>{{citation|title=As we may read|last=Ginsparg|first=Paul|year=2006|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|volume=26|issue=38|pages=9606\u20139608|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3161-06.2006|pmid=16988030|pmc=6674456}}</ref>  Under the system, for categories that use it, an author must be endorsed by an established arXiv author before being allowed to submit papers to those categories. Endorsers are not asked to review the paper for errors, but to check whether the paper is appropriate for the intended subject area.<ref name=\"mckinney\" /> New authors from recognized academic institutions generally receive automatic endorsement, which in practice means that they do not need to deal with the endorsement system at all.  However, the endorsement system has attracted criticism for allegedly restricting scientific inquiry.<ref>{{citation|journal=International Journal of Theoretical Physics|date=July 2005|volume=44|issue=7|pages=691\u2013692|title=Preface to the Proceedings of Quantum Structures 2002|first1=Richard|last1=Greechie|first2=Sylvia|last2=Pulmannova|first3=Karl|last3=Svozil|doi=10.1007/s10773-005-7053-z|quote=The new endorsement system may contribute to an effective barrier, a digital divide|bibcode = 2005IJTP...44..691G }}</ref>\n\nA majority of the [[e-print]]s are also submitted to [[scientific journal|journals]] for publication, but some work, including some very influential papers, remain purely as e-prints and are never published in a peer-reviewed journal.  A well-known example of the latter is an outline of a proof of [[Thurston's geometrization conjecture]], including the [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]] as a particular case, uploaded by [[Grigori Perelman]] in November 2002.<ref>{{cite arXiv|author=Perelman, Grisha|title=The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications|eprint = math.DG/0211159|date=November 11, 2002}}</ref> Perelman appears content to forgo the traditional peer-reviewed journal process, stating: \"If anybody is interested in my way of solving the problem, it's all there {{bracket|on the arXiv}}{{spnd}}let them go and read about it\".<ref>{{cite newspaper |first=Nadejda |last=Lobastova |first2=Michael |last2=Hirst |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/maths-genius-living-in-poverty/2006/08/20/1156012411120.html |title=Maths genius living in poverty |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=August 21, 2006}}</ref> Despite this non-traditional method of publication, other mathematicians recognized this work by offering the [[Fields Medal]] and [[Millennium Prize Problems|Clay Mathematics Millennium Prizes]] to Perelman, both of which he refused.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/01/AR2010070106247.html|title=Russian mathematician wins $1 million prize, but he appears to be happy with $0|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 2, 2010|first=Marc|last=Kaufman}}</ref>\n\n== Submission formats ==\n\nPapers can be submitted in any of several formats, including [[LaTeX]], and [[PDF]] printed from a [[word processor]] other than TeX or LaTeX. The [[Electronic submission|submission]] is rejected by the arXiv software if generating the final PDF file fails, if any image file is too large, or if the total size of the submission is too large.  arXiv now allows one to store and modify an incomplete submission, and only finalize the submission when ready. The time stamp on the article is set when the submission is finalized.\n\n== Access ==\nThe standard access route is through the arXiv.org website or one of several mirrors. Several other interfaces and access routes have also been created by other un-associated organisations.\n\nThese include the [[University of California, Davis]]'s ''front'', a [[web portal]] that offers additional search functions and a more self-explanatory interface for arXiv.org, and is referred to by some mathematicians as (the) Front.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/ |title=Front for the arXiv |publisher=Front.math.ucdavis.edu |date=September 10, 2007 |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}</ref> A similar function used to be offered by eprintweb.org, launched in September 2006 by the [[Institute of Physics]], and was switched off on June 30, 2014. Carnegie Mellon provides Table<sup>arXiv</sup>,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/eager/arxiv/ |title=Table<sup>arXiv</sup>  |accessdate=September 15, 2015}}</ref> a search engine for tables extracted from arXiv publications.

As of 2020, the Unpaywall dump links over 500,000 arxiv URLs as the [[open access]] version of a work found in [[CrossRef]] data from the publishers, making arXiv a top 10 global host of [[green open access]].\n\nFinally, researchers can select sub-fields and receive daily e-mailings or [[RSS feed]]s of all submissions in them.\n\n== Copyright status of files ==\nFiles on arXiv can have a number of different copyright statuses:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arxiv.org/help/license |title=arXiv License Information |publisher=Arxiv.org |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}</ref>\n#Some are [[public domain]],

non-exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them.\n#Most are copyright to the author, and arXiv has only a non-exclusive irrevocable license to distribute them.\n\n== Controversy ==\nWhile arXiv does contain some dubious e-prints, such as those claiming to refute famous theorems or proving famous conjectures such as [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] using only high-school mathematics, a 2002 article
