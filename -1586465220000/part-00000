In a planned economy, economic planning is the principal allocation mechanism between firms rather than markets, with the economy's [[means of production]] being owned and operated by a single organizational body.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chappelow|first=Jim|others=Scott, Gordon, rev.|date=29 January 2020|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centrally-planned-economy.asp|title=Centrally Planned Economy|website=Investopedia|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Characteristics ==\n=== Supply and demand ===\nMarket economies rely upon a price system to signal market actors to adjust production and investment. Price formation relies on the interaction of supply and demand to reach or approximate an equilibrium where unit price for a particular good or service is at a point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.\n\nGovernments can intervene by establishing [[price ceiling]]s or price floors in specific markets (such as [[minimum wage]] laws in the labor market), or use [[fiscal policy]] to discourage certain consumer behavior or to address market externalities generated by certain transactions ([[Pigovian tax]]es). Different perspectives exist on the role of government in both regulating and guiding market economies and in addressing social inequalities produced by markets. Fundamentally, a market economy requires that a price system affected by supply and demand exists as the primary mechanism for allocating resources irrespective of the level of regulation.\n\n=== Property rights ===\nFor market economies to function efficiently, governments must establish clearly defined and enforceable [[property rights]] for assets and capital goods. However, property rights does not specifically mean private property rights and market economies do not logically presuppose the existence of [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. Market economies can and often do include various types of [[cooperatives]] or autonomous [[state-owned enterprise]]s that acquire [[capital goods]] and raw materials in [[capital market]]s. These enterprises utilize a market-determined free price system to allocate capital goods and labor.<ref name=\"auburn.edu\">{{cite web | url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/market_economy | title=A Glossary of Political Economy Terms, Market economy | author=Paul M.

In general, in capitalist systems investment, distribution, income and prices are determined by markets, whether regulated or unregulated.\n\nThere are different variations of capitalism with different relationships to markets. In ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and [[free market]] variations of capitalism, markets are utilized most extensively with minimal or no state intervention and minimal or no regulation over prices and the supply of goods and services. In [[Economic interventionism|interventionist]], [[welfare capitalism]] and [[mixed economies]], markets continue to play a dominant role, but they are regulated to some extent by government in order to correct [[market failure]]s or to promote social welfare. In [[state capitalist]] systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on either [[Indicative planning|indirect economic planning]] and/or [[State enterprise|state-owned enterprises]] to accumulate capital.\n\nCapitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of [[feudalism]], but most feel{{Who|date=June 2012}} that the term mixed economies more precisely describes most contemporary economies due to their containing both private-owned and state-owned enterprises. In capitalism, prices determine the demand-supply scale. For example, higher demand for certain goods and services lead to higher prices and lower demand for certain goods lead to lower prices.\n\n=== Free-market capitalism ===\n{{see also|Free market}}\nFree-market economy refers to an economic system where prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy. It typically entails support for highly competitive markets, private ownership of productive enterprises. ''Laissez-faire'' is a more extensive form of free-market economy where the role of the state is limited to protecting [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]].\n\n=== ''Laissez-faire'' capitalism ===\n{{main|Laissez-faire}}\n{{see also|Economic liberalism}}\n{{economic liberalism sidebar|ideas}}\n''Laissez-faire'' is synonymous with what was referred to as strict [[capitalist]] [[free-market]] economy during the early and mid-19th century{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} as a [[classical liberal]] ideal to achieve. It is generally understood that the necessary components for the functioning of an idealized free market include the complete absence of government regulation, subsidies, artificial price pressures and government-granted monopolies (usually classified as [[coercive monopoly]] by free market advocates) and no taxes or tariffs other than what is necessary for the government to provide protection from coercion and theft, maintaining peace and property rights and providing for basic public goods. [[Right-libertarian]] advocates of [[anarcho-capitalism]] see the state as morally [[illegitimate]] and economically unnecessary and destructive. Although ''laissez-faire'' has been commonly associated with capitalism, there is a similar [[left-wing]] ''laissez-faire'' system called [[free-market anarchism]], also known as [[Left-wing market anarchism|free-market anti-capitalism]] and [[free-market socialism]] to distinguish it from ''laissez-faire'' capitalism.<ref>Chartier, Gary; Johnson, Charles W.

The economic mechanism involves a free market and the predominance of privately owned enterprises in the economy, but public provision of universal welfare services aimed at enhancing individual autonomy and maximizing equality. Examples of contemporary welfare capitalism include the [[Nordic model]] of capitalism predominant in Northern Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/files/Sweden%20Paper.pdf |title=The surprising ingredients of Swedish success - free markets and social cohesion |date=June 25, 2013 |publisher=[[Institute of Economic Affairs]] |accessdate=January 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Regional models ===\n==== Anglo-Saxon model ====\n{{main|Anglo-Saxon economy}}\nAnglo-Saxon capitalism refers to the form of capitalism predominant in Anglophone countries and typified by the [[economy of the United States]]. It is contrasted with European models of capitalism such as the continental [[Social market economy|social market]] model and the [[Nordic model]]. Anglo-Saxon capitalism refers to a macroeconomic policy regime and capital market structure common to the Anglophone economies. Among these characteristics are low rates of taxation, more open [[financial market]]s, lower labor market protections and a less generous [[welfare state]] eschewing [[collective bargaining]] schemes found in the continental and northern European models of capitalism.<ref>''Anglo-Saxon capitalism'', Business Dictionary on BusinessDictionary.com: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/Anglo-Saxon-capitalism.html</ref>\n\n==== East Asian model ====\n{{main|East Asian model of capitalism}}\nThe East Asian model of capitalism involves a strong role for state investment and in some instances involves state-owned enterprises. The state takes an active role in promoting economic development through subsidies, the facilitation of \"national champions\" and an export-based model of growth. The actual practice of this model varies by country. This designation has been applied to the economies of China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.\n\nA related concept in political science is the [[developmental state]].\n\n==== Social market economy ====\n{{main|Social market economy}}\nThis model was implemented by [[Alfred M\u00fcller-Armack]] and [[Ludwig Erhard]] after [[World War II]] in [[West Germany]]. The social market economic model (sometimes called [[Rhine capitalism]]) is based upon the idea of realizing the benefits of a free-market economy, especially economic performance and high supply of goods while avoiding disadvantages such as [[market failure]], destructive competition, concentration of [[economic power]] and the socially harmful effects of market processes. The aim of the social market economy is to realize greatest prosperity combined with best possible social security. One difference from the free market economy is that the state is not passive, but instead takes active [[Regulation|regulatory]] measures.<ref>[http://www.bpb.de/popup/popup_lemmata.html?guid=Y0VZ7J keyword \"social market economy\" = \u201cSoziale Marktwirtschaft\u201d] Duden Wirtschaft von A bis Z.

In a market socialist economy, firms operate according to the rules of supply and demand and operate to maximize profit; the principal difference between market socialism and capitalism being that the profits accrue to society as a whole as opposed to private owners.<ref>''Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century'', 2003, by Gregory and Stuart. {{ISBN|0-618-26181-8}}.

Profits derived from publicly owned enterprises can variously be used to reinvest in further production, to directly finance government and social services, or be distributed to the public at large through a [[social dividend]] or [[basic income]] system.<ref name=\"Social Dividend versus Basic Income Guarantee in Market Socialism, 2004\">''Social Dividend versus Basic Income Guarantee in Market Socialism'', by Marangos, John. 2004.

In this model of socialism, firms would be state-owned and managed by their employees and the profits would be disbursed among the population in a social dividend. This model came to be referred to as market socialism because it involved the use of money, a [[price system]] and simulated capital markets, all of which were absent from traditional of non-market socialism.\n\nA more contemporary model of market socialism is that put forth by the American economist [[John Roemer]], referred to as [[economic democracy]]. In this model, [[social ownership]] is achieved through public ownership of equity in a market economy. A Bureau of Public Ownership would own controlling shares in publicly listed firms, so that the profits generated would be used for public finance and the provision of a basic income.\n\nSome [[Free-market anarchism|anarchists]] and [[libertarian socialists]] promote a form of market socialism in which enterprises are owned and managed cooperatively by their workforce so that the profits directly remunerate the employee-owners. These cooperative enterprises would compete with each other in the same way private companies compete with each other in a capitalist market. The first major elaboration of this type of market socialism was made by [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and was called mutualism.\n\nSelf-managed market socialism was promoted in Yugoslavia by economists [[Branko Horvat]] and [[Jaroslav Vanek]]. In the self-managed model of socialism, firms would be directly owned by their employees and the management board would be elected by employees. These cooperative firms would compete with each other in a market for both capital goods and for selling consumer goods.\n\n=== Socialist market economy ===\nFollowing the [[1978 reforms]], China developed what it calls a [[socialist market economy]] in which most of the economy is under state ownership, with the state enterprises organized as joint-stock companies with various government agencies owning controlling shares through a shareholder system. Prices are set by a largely free-price system and the state-owned enterprises are not subjected to micromanagement by a government planning agency. A similar system called [[socialist-oriented market economy]] has emerged in Vietnam following the [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]] reforms in 1986. This system is frequently characterized as [[state capitalism]] instead of market socialism because there is no meaningful degree of employee self-management in firms, because the state enterprises retain their profits instead of distributing them to the workforce or government and because many function as ''de facto'' private enterprises. The profits neither finance a social dividend to benefit the population at large, nor do they accrue to their employees. In China, this economic model is presented as a [[Primary stage of socialism|preliminary stage of socialism]] to explain the dominance of capitalistic management practices and forms of enterprise organization in both the state and non-state sectors.\n\n== In religion ==\nA wide range of philosophers and theologians have linked market economies to monotheistic values. [[Michael Novak]] described capitalism as being closely related to Catholicism, but [[Max Weber]] drew a connection between capitalism and [[Protestantism]]. The economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]] has stated that his work was inspired by the healing characteristics of Judaism. Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks of the [[United Synagogue]] draws a correlation between modern capitalism and the Jewish image of the [[Golden Calf]].<ref>Lord Sacks, [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/chief-rabbi-lord-sacks/religious-values-market-economy_b_1144469.html \"Rediscovering Religious Values in the Market Economy\"], ''HuffPost'', February 11, 2012</ref>\n\n=== Christianity ===\nIn the Christian faith, the [[liberation theology]] movement advocated involving the church in labor market capitalism. Many priests and nuns integrated themselves into labor organizations while others moved into the slums to live among the poor. The [[Holy Trinity]] was interpreted as a call for social equality and the elimination of poverty. However, the Pope was highly active in his criticism of liberation theology. He was particularly concerned about the increased fusion between Christianity and Marxism. He closed Catholic institutions that taught liberation theology and dismissed some of its activists from the church.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/liberationtheology.shtml \"Liberation theology\"], ''BBC'', July 18, 2011</ref>\n\n=== Buddhism ===\nThe Buddhist approach to the market economy was dealt with in [[E. F. Schumacher]]\u2019s 1966 essay \"Buddhist Economics\". Schumacher asserted that a market economy guided by Buddhist principles would more successfully meet the needs of its people. He emphasized the importance or pursuing occupations that adhered to Buddhist teachings.  The essay would later become required reading for a course that Clair Brown offered at [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>Kathleen Maclay, [http://news.berkeley.edu/2014/03/13/buddhist-economics-oxymoron-or-idea-whose-time-has-come/ \"Buddhist economics: oxymoron or idea whose time has come?\"], ''Berkeley News'', March 13, 2014</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that markets suffer from informational inefficiency and the presumed efficiency of markets stems from the faulty assumptions of [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] welfare economics, particularly the assumption of perfect and costless information and related incentive problems. Neoclassical economics assumes static equilibrium and efficient markets require that there be no non-[[Convexity (finance)|convexities]], even though nonconvexities are pervasive in modern economies. Stiglitz's critique applies to both existing models of capitalism and to hypothetical models of market socialism. However, Stiglitz does not advocate replacing markets, but instead states that there is a significant role for [[Economic interventionism|government intervention]] to boost the efficiency of markets and to address the pervasive market failures that exist in contemporary economies.<ref>{{cite book |last= Michie|first= Jonathan | authorlink = Jonathan Michie|title= Reader\u2019s Guide to the Social Sciences |publisher= Routledge|date=January 1, 2001|isbn= 978-1579580919|page =1012  |quote=Stiglitz criticizes the first and second welfare theorems for being based on the assumptions of complete markets (including a full set of futures and risk markets) and perfect and costless information, which are simply not true.

The ability to decentralize using the price system requires that there be no nonconvexities, but nonconvexities are pervasive.}}</ref> A fair market economy is in fact a [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] or a [[Brownian motion]] model and for a participant competitor in such a model there is no more than 50% of success chances at any given moment.

For example, if one worker designs cars and another builds them, the designer will use his cognitive skills more frequently than the builder. In the long term, the designer will become more adept at conceptual work than the builder, giving the former greater bargaining power in a firm over the distribution of income. A conceptual worker who is not satisfied with his income can threaten to work for a company that will pay him more. The effect is a class division between conceptual and manual laborers, and ultimately managers and workers, and a de facto labor market for conceptual workers.<ref name='Comparison'>{{cite news|first=Adam |last=Weiss |coauthors= |title=A Comparison of Economic Democracy and Participatory Economics |date=2005-05-04 |publisher= |url=http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/6345 |work=[[ZMag]] |pages= |accessdate=2008-06-26 |language= }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[David McNally (professor)|David McNally]] argues in the [[Marxist]] tradition that the logic of the market inherently produces inequitable outcomes and leads to unequal exchanges, arguing that [[Adam Smith]]'s moral intent and moral philosophy espousing equal exchange was undermined by the practice of the free markets he championed. The development of the market economy involved coercion, exploitation and violence that Smith's moral philosophy could not countenance. McNally also criticizes market socialists for believing in the possibility of fair markets based on equal exchanges to be achieved by purging parasitical elements from the market economy such as [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]].

In a planned economy, economic planning is the principal allocation mechanism between firms rather than markets, with the economy's [[means of production]] being owned and operated by a single organizational body.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chappelow|first=Jim|others=Scott, Gordon, rev.|date=29 January 2020|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/centrally-planned-economy.asp|title=Centrally Planned Economy|website=Investopedia|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Characteristics ==\n=== Supply and demand ===\nMarket economies rely upon a price system to signal market actors to adjust production and investment. Price formation relies on the interaction of supply and demand to reach or approximate an equilibrium where unit price for a particular good or service is at a point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.\n\nGovernments can intervene by establishing [[price ceiling]]s or price floors in specific markets (such as [[minimum wage]] laws in the labor market), or use [[fiscal policy]] to discourage certain consumer behavior or to address market externalities generated by certain transactions ([[Pigovian tax]]es). Different perspectives exist on the role of government in both regulating and guiding market economies and in addressing social inequalities produced by markets. Fundamentally, a market economy requires that a price system affected by supply and demand exists as the primary mechanism for allocating resources irrespective of the level of regulation.\n\n=== Property rights ===\nFor market economies to function efficiently, governments must establish clearly defined and enforceable [[property rights]] for assets and capital goods. However, property rights does not specifically mean private property rights and market economies do not logically presuppose the existence of [[Private property|private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. Market economies can and often do include various types of [[cooperatives]] or autonomous [[state-owned enterprise]]s that acquire [[capital goods]] and raw materials in [[capital market]]s. These enterprises utilize a market-determined free price system to allocate capital goods and labor.<ref name=\"auburn.edu\">{{cite web | url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/market_economy | title=A Glossary of Political Economy Terms, Market economy | author=Paul M.

In general, in capitalist systems investment, distribution, income and prices are determined by markets, whether regulated or unregulated.\n\nThere are different variations of capitalism with different relationships to markets. In ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and [[free market]] variations of capitalism, markets are utilized most extensively with minimal or no state intervention and minimal or no regulation over prices and the supply of goods and services. In [[Economic interventionism|interventionist]], [[welfare capitalism]] and [[mixed economies]], markets continue to play a dominant role, but they are regulated to some extent by government in order to correct [[market failure]]s or to promote social welfare. In [[state capitalist]] systems, markets are relied upon the least, with the state relying heavily on either [[Indicative planning|indirect economic planning]] and/or [[State enterprise|state-owned enterprises]] to accumulate capital.\n\nCapitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of [[feudalism]], but most feel{{Who|date=June 2012}} that the term mixed economies more precisely describes most contemporary economies due to their containing both private-owned and state-owned enterprises. In capitalism, prices determine the demand-supply scale. For example, higher demand for certain goods and services lead to higher prices and lower demand for certain goods lead to lower prices.\n\n=== Free-market capitalism ===\n{{see also|Free market}}\nFree-market economy refers to an economic system where prices for goods and services are set freely by the forces of supply and demand and are allowed to reach their point of equilibrium without intervention by government policy. It typically entails support for highly competitive markets, private ownership of productive enterprises. ''Laissez-faire'' is a more extensive form of free-market economy where the role of the state is limited to protecting [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]].\n\n=== ''Laissez-faire'' capitalism ===\n{{main|Laissez-faire}}\n{{see also|Economic liberalism}}\n{{economic liberalism sidebar|ideas}}\n''Laissez-faire'' is synonymous with what was referred to as strict [[capitalist]] [[free-market]] economy during the early and mid-19th century{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} as a [[classical liberal]] ideal to achieve. It is generally understood that the necessary components for the functioning of an idealized free market include the complete absence of government regulation, subsidies, artificial price pressures and government-granted monopolies (usually classified as [[coercive monopoly]] by free market advocates) and no taxes or tariffs other than what is necessary for the government to provide protection from coercion and theft, maintaining peace and property rights and providing for basic public goods. [[Right-libertarian]] advocates of [[anarcho-capitalism]] see the state as morally [[illegitimate]] and economically unnecessary and destructive. Although ''laissez-faire'' has been commonly associated with capitalism, there is a similar [[left-wing]] ''laissez-faire'' system called [[free-market anarchism]], also known as [[Left-wing market anarchism|free-market anti-capitalism]] and [[free-market socialism]] to distinguish it from ''laissez-faire'' capitalism.<ref>Chartier, Gary; Johnson, Charles W.

The economic mechanism involves a free market and the predominance of privately owned enterprises in the economy, but public provision of universal welfare services aimed at enhancing individual autonomy and maximizing equality.

It is contrasted with European models of capitalism such as the continental [[Social market economy|social market]] model and the [[Nordic model]]. Anglo-Saxon capitalism refers to a macroeconomic policy regime and capital market structure common to the Anglophone economies. Among these characteristics are low rates of taxation, more open [[financial market]]s, lower labor market protections and a less generous [[welfare state]] eschewing [[collective bargaining]] schemes found in the continental and northern European models of capitalism.<ref>''Anglo-Saxon capitalism'', Business Dictionary on BusinessDictionary.com: http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/Anglo-Saxon-capitalism.html</ref>\n\n==== East Asian model ====\n{{main|East Asian model of capitalism}}\nThe East Asian model of capitalism involves a strong role for state investment and in some instances involves state-owned enterprises. The state takes an active role in promoting economic development through subsidies, the facilitation of \"national champions\" and an export-based model of growth. The actual practice of this model varies by country. This designation has been applied to the economies of China, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.\n\nA related concept in political science is the [[developmental state]].\n\n==== Social market economy ====\n{{main|Social market economy}}\nThis model was implemented by [[Alfred M\u00fcller-Armack]] and [[Ludwig Erhard]] after [[World War II]] in [[West Germany]]. The social market economic model (sometimes called [[Rhine capitalism]]) is based upon the idea of realizing the benefits of a free-market economy, especially economic performance and high supply of goods while avoiding disadvantages such as [[market failure]], destructive competition, concentration of [[economic power]] and the socially harmful effects of market processes. The aim of the social market economy is to realize greatest prosperity combined with best possible social security.

These cooperative firms would compete with each other in a market for both capital goods and for selling consumer goods.\n\n=== Socialist market economy ===\nFollowing the [[1978 reforms]], China developed what it calls a [[socialist market economy]] in which most of the economy is under state ownership, with the state enterprises organized as joint-stock companies with various government agencies owning controlling shares through a shareholder system. Prices are set by a largely free-price system and the state-owned enterprises are not subjected to micromanagement by a government planning agency. A similar system called [[socialist-oriented market economy]] has emerged in Vietnam following the [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]] reforms in 1986. This system is frequently characterized as [[state capitalism]] instead of market socialism because there is no meaningful degree of employee self-management in firms, because the state enterprises retain their profits instead of distributing them to the workforce or government and because many function as ''de facto'' private enterprises. The profits neither finance a social dividend to benefit the population at large, nor do they accrue to their employees.

Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks of the [[United Synagogue]] draws a correlation between modern capitalism and the Jewish image of the [[Golden Calf]].<ref>Lord Sacks, [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/chief-rabbi-lord-sacks/religious-values-market-economy_b_1144469.html \"Rediscovering Religious Values in the Market Economy\"], ''HuffPost'', February 11, 2012</ref>\n\n=== Christianity ===\nIn the Christian faith, the [[liberation theology]] movement advocated involving the church in labor market capitalism. Many priests and nuns integrated themselves into labor organizations while others moved into the slums to live among the poor. The [[Holy Trinity]] was interpreted as a call for social equality and the elimination of poverty. However, the Pope was highly active in his criticism of liberation theology. He was particularly concerned about the increased fusion between Christianity and Marxism. He closed Catholic institutions that taught liberation theology and dismissed some of its activists from the church.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/liberationtheology.shtml \"Liberation theology\"], ''BBC'', July 18, 2011</ref>\n\n=== Buddhism ===\nThe Buddhist approach to the market economy was dealt with in [[E. F. Schumacher]]\u2019s 1966 essay \"Buddhist Economics\". Schumacher asserted that a market economy guided by Buddhist principles would more successfully meet the needs of its people. He emphasized the importance or pursuing occupations that adhered to Buddhist teachings.  The essay would later become required reading for a course that Clair Brown offered at [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>Kathleen Maclay, [http://news.berkeley.edu/2014/03/13/buddhist-economics-oxymoron-or-idea-whose-time-has-come/ \"Buddhist economics: oxymoron or idea whose time has come?\"], ''Berkeley News'', March 13, 2014</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\nThe economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] argues that markets suffer from informational inefficiency and the presumed efficiency of markets stems from the faulty assumptions of [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] welfare economics, particularly the assumption of perfect and costless information and related incentive problems. Neoclassical economics assumes static equilibrium and efficient markets require that there be no non-[[Convexity (finance)|convexities]], even though nonconvexities are pervasive in modern economies. Stiglitz's critique applies to both existing models of capitalism and to hypothetical models of market socialism. However, Stiglitz does not advocate replacing markets, but instead states that there is a significant role for [[Economic interventionism|government intervention]] to boost the efficiency of markets and to address the pervasive market failures that exist in contemporary economies.<ref>{{cite book |last= Michie|first= Jonathan | authorlink = Jonathan Michie|title= Reader\u2019s Guide to the Social Sciences |publisher= Routledge|date=January 1, 2001|isbn= 978-1579580919|page =1012  |quote=Stiglitz criticizes the first and second welfare theorems for being based on the assumptions of complete markets (including a full set of futures and risk markets) and perfect and costless information, which are simply not true. Incentives are dubious too. Thus, capitalist markets are also not efficient and there is some role for government intervention. The ability to decentralize using the price system requires that there be no nonconvexities, but nonconvexities are pervasive.}}</ref> A fair market economy is in fact a [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] or a [[Brownian motion]] model and for a participant competitor in such a model there is no more than 50% of success chances at any given moment.

For example, if one worker designs cars and another builds them, the designer will use his cognitive skills more frequently than the builder. In the long term, the designer will become more adept at conceptual work than the builder, giving the former greater bargaining power in a firm over the distribution of income. A conceptual worker who is not satisfied with his income can threaten to work for a company that will pay him more. The effect is a class division between conceptual and manual laborers, and ultimately managers and workers, and a de facto labor market for conceptual workers.<ref name='Comparison'>{{cite news|first=Adam |last=Weiss |coauthors= |title=A Comparison of Economic Democracy and Participatory Economics |date=2005-05-04 |publisher= |url=http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/6345 |work=[[ZMag]] |pages= |accessdate=2008-06-26 |language= }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[David McNally (professor)|David McNally]] argues in the [[Marxist]] tradition that the logic of the market inherently produces inequitable outcomes and leads to unequal exchanges, arguing that [[Adam Smith]]'s moral intent and moral philosophy espousing equal exchange was undermined by the practice of the free markets he championed. The development of the market economy involved coercion, exploitation and violence that Smith's moral philosophy could not countenance. McNally also criticizes market socialists for believing in the possibility of fair markets based on equal exchanges to be achieved by purging parasitical elements from the market economy such as [[private ownership]] of the [[means of production]]. McNally argues that [[market socialism]] is an oxymoron when [[socialism]] is defined as an end to [[Wage labor|wage-based labor]].<ref>{{cite book|last=McNally|first=David|title=Against the Market: Political Economy, Market Socialism and the Marxist Critique|publisher=Verso|year=1993|isbn=978-0-86091-606-2}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Capitalism]]\n* [[Classical economics]]\n* [[Economic freedom]]\n* [[Economic liberalism]]\n* [[Free market]]\n* [[Free-market anarchism]]\n* [[Gift economy]]\n* [[Grey market]]\n* ''[[Laissez-faire]]''\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Market structure]]\n* [[Mixed economy]]\n* [[Neoclassical economics]]\n* [[Planned economy]]\n* [[Price system]]\n* [[Regulated market]]\n* [[Social market economy]]\n* [[Socialist market economy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n== External links == \n* [https://www.britannica.com/topic/economic-system/Market-systems Market Systems] at ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' Online.\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Market economy}}\n[[Category:Capitalism]]\n[[Category:Classical liberalism]]\n[[Category:Economic ideologies]]\n[[Category:Economic liberalism]]\n[[Category:Economic systems]]\n[[Category:Market (economics)]]\n[[Category:Market socialism]]\n", "name_user": "Davide King", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eModels of market socialism:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy"}

The [[source code]] of these commercially developed and distributed [[video game]]s is available to the public or the games' communities.\n\n== Motivation ==\nCommercial video games are typically developed as [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[closed source]] [[software product]]s, with the source code treated as a [[trade secret]] (unlike [[open-source video game]]s). When there is no more expected revenue, these games enter the [[end-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] as a product with no support or availability for the game's users and community, becoming [[abandonware|abandoned]].\n\n== Description ==\nIn several of the cases listed here, the game's developers released the source code expressly to prevent their work from becoming abandonware. Such source code is often released under varying (free and non-free, commercial and non-commercial) [[software license]]s to the games' communities or the public; artwork and data are often released under a different license than the source code, as the copyright situation is different or more complicated. The source code may be pushed by the developers to public repositories (e.g. [[SourceForge]] or [[GitHub]]), or given to selected game community members, or sold with the game, or become available by other means. The game may be written in an [[interpreted language]] such as [[BASIC]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and distributed as raw source code without being [[Compiler|compiled]]; early software was often distributed in text form, as in the book ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''. In some cases when a game's source code is not available by other means, the game's community \"reconstructs\" source code from compiled [[binary file]]s through time-demanding [[reverse engineering]] techniques. \nSource code availability in whatever form allows the games' communities to study how the game works, make modifications, and provide technical support themselves when the official support has ended, e.g. with [[unofficial patch]]es to fix bugs or [[source port]]s to make the game compatible with new [[Computing platform|platforms]].\n\n== Games with instantly included source code ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!First release\n!Source code release\n!Genre\n!Engine license\n!Content license\n!Original developer\n!Additional information\n|-\n|''[[A Dark Room]]''\n|2013\n|2013\n|[[Online text-based role-playing game]]\n|[[Mozilla Public License]]\n|[[Mozilla Public License]]\n|Doublespeak Games\n|In July 2013 the [[source code]] of the game was put on [[GitHub]] under [[Mozilla Public License|MPL]] 2.0.<ref>[http://blog.doublespeakgames.com/news/a-dark-room-goes-open-source/ A Dark Room goes open source] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907210142/http://blog.doublespeakgames.com/news/a-dark-room-goes-open-source/ |date=2015-09-07 }} on doublespeakgames.com (July 3, 2013)</ref> Became commercially successful after the source code release.\n|-\n|''[[Akalabeth: World of Doom]]''\n|1979\n|1979\n|[[Role-playing video game]]\n|public domain\n|Freeware\n|[[Richard Garriott]]\n|[[Richard Garriott]] distributed the [[Applesoft BASIC]] written game originally as source code.

Techniques used to accomplish this are [[Decompiler|decompiling]], [[Disassembler|disassembling]], and [[reverse engineering]] the binary [[executable]]. This approach typically does not result in the exact original source code but rather a divergent version, as a binary program does not contain all of the information originally carried in the source code. For example, comments and function names cannot be restored if the program was compiled without additional [[Debugging|debug]] information.\n\nUsing the techniques listed above within a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|\"bottom-up\" development methodology]] process, the re-created source-code of a game is able to replicate the behavior of the original game exactly, often being \"clock-cycle accurate\", and/or \"pixel-per-pixel accurate\".  This approach is in contrast to that used by [[game engine recreation]]s, which are often made using a \"top-down\" development methodology, and which can result in duplicating the general features provided by a [[game engine]], but not necessarily an accurate representation of the original game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!Original release\n!Source code reconstructed\n!Genre\n!Original developer\n!Additional information\n|-\n|''[[Albion (video game)|Albion]]''\n|1996\n|2011\n|[[Adventure game]]\n|[[Blue Byte]]\n|In 2011 via [[static recompilation]] from the original [[x86]] binary executable a port for the [[ARM architecture]] of the [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]] [[handheld]] was created by fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/ |title=Albion |date=2011-11-06 |author=M-HT |accessdate=2014-04-03 |publisher=openpandora.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407071307/http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=albion_sr |title=Albion |author=M-HT |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate=2014-04-02 |publisher=repo.openpandora.org |quote=''This is a port of the game's executable for Pandora (using static recompilation/binary translation).'' |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331042620/http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=albion_sr |archivedate=2014-03-31 }}</ref> The community still updates this recompiled version and released also Windows and Linux builds in 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/page-4#entry375940 |title=Albion |author=M-HT |date=2015-03-16 |accessdate=2015-04-24 |publisher=boards.openpandora.org |quote=''Here is a version for Windows, in case anyone is interested.

The [[source code]] of these commercially developed and distributed [[video game]]s is available to the public or the games' communities.\n\n== Motivation ==\nCommercial video games are typically developed as [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[closed source]] [[software product]]s, with the source code treated as a [[trade secret]] (unlike [[open-source video game]]s). When there is no more expected revenue, these games enter the [[end-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] as a product with no support or availability for the game's users and community, becoming [[abandonware|abandoned]].\n\n== Description ==\nIn several of the cases listed here, the game's developers released the source code expressly to prevent their work from becoming abandonware. Such source code is often released under varying (free and non-free, commercial and non-commercial) [[software license]]s to the games' communities or the public; artwork and data are often released under a different license than the source code, as the copyright situation is different or more complicated. The source code may be pushed by the developers to public repositories (e.g. [[SourceForge]] or [[GitHub]]), or given to selected game community members, or sold with the game, or become available by other means. The game may be written in an [[interpreted language]] such as [[BASIC]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and distributed as raw source code without being [[Compiler|compiled]]; early software was often distributed in text form, as in the book ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]''. In some cases when a game's source code is not available by other means, the game's community \"reconstructs\" source code from compiled [[binary file]]s through time-demanding [[reverse engineering]] techniques. \nSource code availability in whatever form allows the games' communities to study how the game works, make modifications, and provide technical support themselves when the official support has ended, e.g. with [[unofficial patch]]es to fix bugs or [[source port]]s to make the game compatible with new [[Computing platform|platforms]].\n\n== Games with instantly included source code ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!First release\n!Source code release\n!Genre\n!Engine license\n!Content license\n!Original developer\n!Additional information\n|-\n|''[[A Dark Room]]''\n|2013\n|2013\n|[[Online text-based role-playing game]]\n|[[Mozilla Public License]]\n|[[Mozilla Public License]]\n|Doublespeak Games\n|In July 2013 the [[source code]] of the game was put on [[GitHub]] under [[Mozilla Public License|MPL]] 2.0.<ref>[http://blog.doublespeakgames.com/news/a-dark-room-goes-open-source/ A Dark Room goes open source] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907210142/http://blog.doublespeakgames.com/news/a-dark-room-goes-open-source/ |date=2015-09-07 }} on doublespeakgames.com (July 3, 2013)</ref> Became commercially successful after the source code release.\n|-\n|''[[Akalabeth: World of Doom]]''\n|1979\n|1979\n|[[Role-playing video game]]\n|public domain\n|Freeware\n|[[Richard Garriott]]\n|[[Richard Garriott]] distributed the [[Applesoft BASIC]] written game originally as source code.

Techniques used to accomplish this are [[Decompiler|decompiling]], [[Disassembler|disassembling]], and [[reverse engineering]] the binary [[executable]]. This approach typically does not result in the exact original source code but rather a divergent version, as a binary program does not contain all of the information originally carried in the source code. For example, comments and function names cannot be restored if the program was compiled without additional [[Debugging|debug]] information.\n\nUsing the techniques listed above within a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|\"bottom-up\" development methodology]] process, the re-created source-code of a game is able to replicate the behavior of the original game exactly, often being \"clock-cycle accurate\", and/or \"pixel-per-pixel accurate\".  This approach is in contrast to that used by [[game engine recreation]]s, which are often made using a \"top-down\" development methodology, and which can result in duplicating the general features provided by a [[game engine]], but not necessarily an accurate representation of the original game.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!Original release\n!Source code reconstructed\n!Genre\n!Original developer\n!Additional information\n|-\n|''[[Albion (video game)|Albion]]''\n|1996\n|2011\n|[[Adventure game]]\n|[[Blue Byte]]\n|In 2011 via [[static recompilation]] from the original [[x86]] binary executable a port for the [[ARM architecture]] of the [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]] [[handheld]] was created by fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/ |title=Albion |date=2011-11-06 |author=M-HT |accessdate=2014-04-03 |publisher=openpandora.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407071307/http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=albion_sr |title=Albion |author=M-HT |date=2011-06-11 |accessdate=2014-04-02 |publisher=repo.openpandora.org |quote=''This is a port of the game's executable for Pandora (using static recompilation/binary translation).'' |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331042620/http://repo.openpandora.org/?page=detail&app=albion_sr |archivedate=2014-03-31 }}</ref> The community still updates this recompiled version and released also Windows and Linux builds in 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.openpandora.org/topic/5950-albion/page-4#entry375940 |title=Albion |author=M-HT |date=2015-03-16 |accessdate=2015-04-24 |publisher=boards.openpandora.org |quote=''Here is a version for Windows, in case anyone is interested.
