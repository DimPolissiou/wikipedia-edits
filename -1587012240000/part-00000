{"title_page": "List of Disney attractions that were never built", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2015}}\nThis is a list of publicly known '''Disney attractions that were never built''', that is, rides and shows of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] parks that never reached the final building stage. Some of them were fully designed and not built. Others were concepts, sometimes with preliminary artwork. Many were developed as far as it could but funding was either reallocated, consolidated and optimized in the \"best possible\" return of investment. In other major projects, signs of reuse documentation was evident in some of the parks.\n\n== Theme parks ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Development Years\n! Description\n!

{"title_page": "Decimal", "text_new": "{{short description|Numeral system with ten as its base}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{more citations needed|talk=Article needs additional citations for verification|date=January 2011}}\n{{Table Numeral Systems}}\nThe '''decimal''' [[numeral system]] (also called '''base-[[10 (number)|ten]]''' [[positional numeral system]], and occasionally called '''denary''' or '''decanary''') is the standard system for denoting [[integer]] and non-integer [[number]]s. It is the extension to non-integer numbers of the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]].<ref>''The History of Arithmetic'', [[Louis Charles Karpinski]], 200 pp, Rand McNally & Company, 1925.</ref> The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as ''decimal notation''.<ref>Lam Lay Yong & Ang Tian Se (2004) ''Fleeting Footsteps. Tracing the Conception of Arithmetic and Algebra in Ancient China'', Revised Edition, World Scientific, Singapore.</ref>\n\nA ''decimal numeral'', or just ''decimal'', or casually ''decimal number'', refers generally to the notation of a number in the decimal numeral system. Decimals may sometimes be identified for containing a [[decimal mark|decimal separator]] (for example the \".\" in {{math|10.00}} or {{math|3.14159}}). \"Decimal\" may also refer specifically to the digits after the decimal separator, such as in \"{{math|3.14}} is the approximation of {{pi}} to ''two decimals''\".\n\nThe numbers that may be represented in the decimal system are the [[#Decimal fractions|decimal fractions]], that is the [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] of the form {{math|''a''/10<sup>''n''</sup>}}, where {{math|''a''}} is an integer, and {{math|''n''}} is a [[non-negative integer]].\n\nThe decimal system has been extended to ''infinite decimals'', for representing any [[real number]], by using an [[sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] of digits after the decimal separator (see [[Decimal representation]]). In this context, the decimal numerals with a finite number of non\u2013zero places after the decimal separator are sometimes called ''terminating decimals''. A [[repeating decimal]] is an infinite decimal that after some place repeats indefinitely the same sequence of digits (for example {{math|1=5.123144144144144... = 5.123{{overline|144}}}}).<ref>The [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum (overline)]] in 5.123<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">144</span> indicates that the '144' sequence repeats indefinitely, i.e. {{val|5.123144144144144|s=...}}.</ref> An infinite decimal represents a [[rational number]] if and only if it is a repeating decimal or has a finite number of nonzero digits.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Two hand, ten fingers.jpg|thumb|right|Ten fingers on two hands, the possible starting point of decimal counting.]]\nMany [[numeral system]]s of ancient civilizations use ten and its powers for representing numbers, possibly because there are ten fingers on two hands and people started counting by using their fingers. Examples are [[Brahmi numerals]], [[Greek numerals]], [[Hebrew numerals]], [[Roman numerals]], and [[Chinese numerals]]. Very large numbers were difficult to represent in these old numeral systems, and only the best mathematicians were able to multiply or divide large numbers. These difficulties were completely solved with the introduction of the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]] for representing [[integer]]s. This system has been extended to represent some non-integer numbers, called ''[[#Decimal fractions|decimal fractions]]'' or ''decimal numbers'' for forming the ''decimal numeral system''.\n\n== Decimal notation ==\nFor writing numbers, the decimal  system uses ten [[decimal digit]]s, a [[decimal mark]], and, for [[negative number]]s, a [[minus sign]] \"\u2212\". The decimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9;<ref>In some countries, such as [[Arab language|Arab speaking]] ones, other [[glyph]]s are used for the digits</ref> the decimal separator is the dot \"{{math|.}}\" in many countries (including all English speaking ones), but may be a comma \"{{math|,}}\" in other countries (mainly in [[continental Europe]]).\n\nFor representing a [[non-negative number]], a decimal consists of\n* either a (finite) sequence of digits such as 2017, or in full generality,\n::<math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0</math>\n:(in this case, the (entire) decimal represents an integer)\n* or two sequence of digits separated by a decimal mark such as 3.14159, 15.00, or in full generality\n::<math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0.b_1b_2\\ldots b_n</math>\nIt is generally assumed that, if {{math|''m'' > 0}}, the first digit {{math|''a''<sub>''m''</sub>}} is not zero, but, in some circumstances, it may be useful to have one or more 0's on the left. This does not change the value represented by the decimal. For example, {{math|1=3.14 = 03.14 = 003.14}}. Similarly, if {{math|1=''b''<sub>''n''</sub> =0}}, it may be removed, and conversely, trailing zeros may be added without changing the represented number: for example, {{math|1=15 = 15.0 = 15.00}} and {{math|1=5.2 = 5.20 = 5.200}}&nbsp;. Sometimes the extra zeros are used for indicating the accuracy of a measurement. For example, 15.00&nbsp;m may indicate that the measurement error is less than one centimeter (0.01&nbsp;m), while 15&nbsp;m may mean that the length is roughly fifteen meters, and that the error may exceed 10&nbsp;cm.\n\nFor representing a [[negative number]], a minus sign is placed before {{math|''a''<sub>''m''</sub>}}.\n\nThe numeral <math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0.b_1b_2\\ldots b_n</math> represents the number\n:<math>a_m10^m+a_{m-1}10^{m-1}+\\cdots+a_{0}10^0+\\frac{b_1}{10^1}+\\frac{b_2}{10^2}+\\cdots+\\frac{b_n}{10^n}</math>\nTherefore, the contribution of each digit to the value of a number depends on its position in the numeral. That is, the decimal system is a [[positional numeral system]]\n\n== Decimal fractions ==\n\nThe numbers that are represented by decimal numerals are the '''decimal fractions''' (sometimes called '''decimal numbers'''), that is, the [[rational number]]s that may be expressed as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]], the [[denominator]] of which is a [[exponentiation|power]] of ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Decimal_fraction|title=Decimal Fraction|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Mathematics]]|accessdate=2013-06-18}}</ref> For example, the numerals <math>0.8, 14.89, 0.00024</math> represent the fractions {{math|{{sfrac|8|10}}}}, {{math|{{sfrac|1489|100}}}}, {{math|{{sfrac|24|100000}}}}. More generally, a decimal with {{math|''n''}} digits after the separator represents the fraction with denominator {{math|10<sup>''n''</sup>}}, whose numerator is the integer obtained by removing the separator.\n\nExpressed as a [[fully reduced fraction]], the decimal numbers are those whose denominator is a product of a power of 2 and a power of 5. Thus the smallest denominators of decimal numbers are\n:<math>1=2^0\\cdot 5^0, 2=2^1\\cdot 5^0, 4=2^2\\cdot 5^0, 5=2^0\\cdot 5^1, 8=2^3\\cdot 5^0, 10=2^1\\cdot 5^1, 16=2^4\\cdot 5^0, 25=2^0\\cdot 5^2, \\ldots</math>\n\n<!-- The remainder of the section seems misplaced here -->The ''[[integer part]]'' or ''integral part'' of a decimal is the integer written to the left of the decimal separator (see also [[truncation]]). For a non-negative decimal, it is the largest integer that is not greater than the decimal. The part from the decimal separator to the right is the ''[[fractional part]]'', which equals the difference between the numeral and its integer part.\n\nWhen the integral part of a numeral is zero, it may occur, typically in [[computing]], that the integer part is not written (for example {{math|.1234}}, instead of {{math|0.1234}}). In normal writing, this is generally avoided because of the risk of confusion between the decimal mark and other punctuation.\n\n==Real number approximation==\n\nDecimal numerals do not allow an exact representation for all [[real number]]s, e.g. for the real number [[pi|{{pi}}]]. Nevertheless, they allow approximating every real number with any desired accuracy, e.g., the decimal 3.14159 approximates the real {{pi}}, being less than 10<sup>\u22125</sup> off; and so decimals are widely used in [[science]], [[engineering]] and everyday life.\n\nMore precisely, for every real number ''x'', and every positive integer ''n'', there are two decimals ''L'' and ''u'', with at most ''n'' digits after the decimal mark, such that ''L'' \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 ''u'' and (''u'' \u2013 ''L'') = 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>.\n\nNumbers are very often obtained as the result of a [[measurement]]. As measurements are generally afflicted with some [[measurement error]] with a known [[upper bound]], the result of a measurement is well represented by a decimal with {{math|''n''}} digits after the decimal mark, as soon as the absolute measurement error is bounded from above by 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>. In practice, measurement results are often given with a certain number of digits after the decimal point, which indicate the error bounds. For example, although 0.080 and 0.08 denote the same decimal number, the numeral 0.080 suggests a measurement with an error less than 0.001, while the numeral 0.08 indicates an absolute error bounded by 0.01. In both cases, the true value of the measured quantity could be, for example, 0.0803 or 0.0796 (see also [[significant figures]]).\n\n==Infinite decimal expansion==\n{{main|Decimal representation}}\n\nFor a [[real number]] ''x'' and an integer ''n'' \u2265 0, let [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> denote the (finite) decimal expansion of the greatest number that is not greater than ''x'', which has exactly ''n'' digits after the decimal mark. Let ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> denote the last digit of [''x'']<sub>''i''</sub>. It is straightforward to see that [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> may be obtained by appending ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> to the right of [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub>. This way one has\n:[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> = [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''d''<sub>''n''</sub>,\n\nand the difference of [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub> and [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> amounts to \n:|[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> \u2212 [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub>| = ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> \u22c5 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup> < 10<sup>\u2212''n''+1</sup>,\n\nwhich is either 0, if ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0, or gets arbitrarily small, when ''n'' tends to infinity. According to the definition of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], ''x'' is the limit of [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> when ''n'' tends to [[infinity]]. This is written as <math display=\"inline\">\\; x = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} [x]_n \\;</math> or\n: ''x'' = [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>...,\nwhich is called an '''infinite decimal expansion''' of ''x''.\n\nConversely, for any integer [''x'']<sub>0</sub> and any sequence of digits <math display=\"inline\">\\;(d_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}</math> the (infinite) expression  {{nowrap|[''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>...}} is an ''infinite decimal expansion'' of a real number ''x''. This expansion is  unique if neither all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 9 nor all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 0 for ''n'' large enough (for all ''n'' greater than some natural number ''N'').\n\nIf all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> for ''n'' > ''N'' equal to 9 and {{nowrap|[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>,}} the limit of the sequence <math display=\"inline\">\\;([x]_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}</math> is the decimal fraction obtained by replacing the last digit that is not a 9, i.e.: ''d''<sub>''N''</sub>, by ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> + 1, and replacing all subsequent 9s by 0s (see [[0.999...]]).\n\nAny such decimal fraction, i.e., ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0 for ''n'' > ''N'', may be converted to its equivalent infinite decimal expansion by replacing ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> by ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> \u2212 1, and replacing all subsequent 0s by 9s (see [[0.999...]]).\n\nIn summary, every real number that is not a decimal fraction has a unique infinite decimal expansion. Each decimal fraction has exactly two infinite decimal expansions, one containing only 0s after some place, which is obtained by the above definition of [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub>, and the other containing only 9s after some place, which is obtained by defining [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> as the greatest number that is ''less'' than ''x'', having exactly ''n'' digits after the decimal mark.\n\n=== Rational numbers ===\n{{main|Repeating decimal}}\n\n[[Long division]] allows computing the infinite decimal expansion of a [[rational number]]. If the rational number is a [[#decimal fraction|decimal fraction]], the division stops eventually, producing a decimal numeral, which may be prolongated into an infinite expansion by adding infinitely many zeros. If the rational number is not a decimal fraction, the division may continue indefinitely. However, as all successive remainders are less than the divisor, there are only a finite number of possible remainders, and after some place, the same sequence of digits must be repeated indefinitely in the quotient. That is, one has a ''repeating decimal''. For example,\n:{{sfrac|81}} = 0.&thinsp;012345679&thinsp;012... (with the group 012345679 indefinitely repeating).\n\nConversely, every eventually repeating sequence of digits is the infinite decimal expansion of a rational number. This is a consequence of the fact that the recurring part of a decimal representation is, in fact, an infinite [[geometric series]] which will sum to a rational number. For example,\n:<math>0.0123123123\\ldots =\\frac{123}{10000} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty 0.001^k = \\frac{123}{10000}\\ \\frac{1}{1-0.001} = \\frac{123}{9990} = \\frac{41}{3330}</math>\n\n== Decimal computation ==\n\n[[File:Decimal multiplication table.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of the world's earliest multiplication table ({{circa}} 305 BC) from the Warring States period]]\n\nMost modern [[computer]] hardware and software systems commonly use a [[Binary numeral system|binary representation]] internally (although many early computers, such as the [[ENIAC]] or the [[IBM 650]], used decimal representation internally).<ref>''Fingers or Fists? (The Choice of Decimal or Binary Representation)'', [[Werner Buchholz]], Communications of the ACM, Vol. 2 #12, pp3\u201311, ACM Press, December 1959.</ref>\nFor external use by computer specialists, this binary representation is sometimes presented in the related [[octal]] or [[hexadecimal]] systems.\n\nFor most purposes, however, binary values are converted to or from the equivalent decimal values for presentation to or input from humans; computer programs express literals in decimal by default. (123.1, for example, is written as such in a computer program, even though many computer languages are unable to encode that number precisely.)\n\nBoth computer hardware and software also use internal representations which are effectively decimal for storing decimal values and doing arithmetic. Often this arithmetic is done on data which are encoded using some variant of [[binary-coded decimal]],<ref name=\"Schmid_1983\">{{cite book |title=Decimal Computation |first=Hermann |author=Schmid<!-- General Electric Company, Binghamton, New York, USA --> |author-link=Hermann Schmid (computer scientist) |orig-year=1974 |date=1983 |edition=1 (reprint) |publisher=Robert E.

All numbers between 10 and 20 are formed regularly (e.g. 11 is expressed as \"tizenegy\" literally \"one on ten\"), as with those between 20 and 100 (23 as \"huszonh\u00e1rom\" = \"three on twenty\").\n\nA straightforward decimal rank system with a word for each order (10 {{lang|zh|\u5341}}, 100 {{lang|zh|\u767e}}, 1000 {{lang|zh|\u5343}}, 10,000 {{lang|zh|\u4e07}}), and in which 11 is expressed as ''ten-one'' and 23 as ''two-ten-three'', and 89,345 is expressed as 8 (ten thousands) {{lang|zh|\u4e07}} 9 (thousand) {{lang|zh|\u5343}} 3 (hundred) {{lang|zh|\u767e}} 4 (tens) {{lang|zh|\u5341}} 5 is found in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with a few irregularities.  [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Thai language|Thai]] have imported the Chinese decimal system.

It is the extension to non-integer numbers of the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]].<ref>''The History of Arithmetic'', [[Louis Charles Karpinski]], 200pp, Rand McNally & Company, 1925.</ref> The way of denoting numbers in the decimal system is often referred to as ''decimal notation''.<ref>Lam Lay Yong & Ang Tian Se (2004) ''Fleeting Footsteps. Tracing the Conception of Arithmetic and Algebra in Ancient China'', Revised Edition, World Scientific, Singapore.</ref>\n\nA ''decimal numeral'', or just ''decimal'', or casually ''decimal number'', refers generally to the notation of a number in the decimal numeral system. Decimals may sometimes be identified for containing a [[decimal mark|decimal separator]] (for example the \".\" in {{math|10.00}} or {{math|3.14159}}). \"Decimal\" may also refer specifically to the digits after the decimal separator, such as in \"{{math|3.14}} is the approximation of {{pi}} to ''two decimals''\".\n\nThe numbers that may be represented in the decimal system are the [[#Decimal fractions|decimal fractions]], that is the [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]] of the form {{math|''a''/10<sup>''n''</sup>}}, where {{math|''a''}} is an integer, and {{math|''n''}} is a [[non-negative integer]].\n\nThe decimal system has been extended to ''infinite decimals'', for representing any [[real number]], by using an [[sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] of digits after the decimal separator (see [[Decimal representation]]). In this context, the decimal numerals with a finite number of non\u2013zero places after the decimal separator are sometimes called ''terminating decimals''. A [[repeating decimal]] is an infinite decimal that after some place repeats indefinitely the same sequence of digits (for example {{math|1=5.123144144144144... = 5.123{{overline|144}}}}).<ref>The [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum (overline)]] in 5.123<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">144</span> indicates that the '144' sequence repeats indefinitely, i.e. {{val|5.123144144144144|s=...}}.</ref> An infinite decimal represents a [[rational number]] if and only if it is a repeating decimal or has a finite number of nonzero digits.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Two hand, ten fingers.jpg|thumb|right|Ten fingers on two hands, the possible starting point of decimal counting.]]\nMany [[numeral system]]s of ancient civilizations use ten and its powers for representing numbers, possibly because there are ten fingers on two hands and people started counting by using their fingers. Examples are [[Brahmi numerals]], [[Greek numerals]], [[Hebrew numerals]], [[Roman numerals]], and [[Chinese numerals]]. Very large numbers were difficult to represent in these old numeral systems, and only the best mathematicians were able to multiply or divide large numbers. These difficulties were completely solved with the introduction of the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]] for representing [[integer]]s. This system has been extended to represent some non-integer numbers, called ''[[#Decimal fractions|decimal fractions]]'' or ''decimal numbers'' for forming the ''decimal numeral system''.\n\n== Decimal notation ==\nFor writing numbers, the decimal  system uses ten [[decimal digit]]s, a [[decimal mark]], and, for [[negative number]]s, a [[minus sign]] \"\u2212\". The decimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9;<ref>In some countries, such as [[Arab language|Arab speaking]] ones, other [[glyph]]s are used for the digits</ref> the decimal separator is the dot \"{{math|.}}\" in many countries (including all English speaking ones), but may be a comma \"{{math|,}}\" in other countries (mainly in [[continental Europe]]).\n\nFor representing a [[non-negative number]], a decimal consists of\n* either a (finite) sequence of digits such as 2017, or in full generality,\n::<math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0</math>\n:(in this case, the (entire) decimal represents an integer)\n* or two sequence of digits separated by a decimal mark such as 3.14159, 15.00, or in full generality\n::<math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0.b_1b_2\\ldots b_n</math>\nIt is generally assumed that, if {{math|''m'' > 0}}, the first digit {{math|''a''<sub>''m''</sub>}} is not zero, but, in some circumstances, it may be useful to have one or more 0's on the left. This does not change the value represented by the decimal. For example, {{math|1=3.14 = 03.14 = 003.14}}. Similarly, if {{math|1=''b''<sub>''n''</sub> =0}}, it may be removed, and conversely, trailing zeros may be added without changing the represented number: for example, {{math|1=15 = 15.0 = 15.00}} and {{math|1=5.2 = 5.20 = 5.200}}&nbsp;. Sometimes the extra zeros are used for indicating the accuracy of a measurement. For example, 15.00&nbsp;m may indicate that the measurement error is less than one centimeter (0.01&nbsp;m), while 15&nbsp;m may mean that the length is roughly fifteen meters, and that the error may exceed 10&nbsp;cm.\n\nFor representing a [[negative number]], a minus sign is placed before {{math|''a''<sub>''m''</sub>}}.\n\nThe numeral <math>a_ma_{m-1}\\ldots a_0.b_1b_2\\ldots b_n</math> represents the number\n:<math>a_m10^m+a_{m-1}10^{m-1}+\\cdots+a_{0}10^0+\\frac{b_1}{10^1}+\\frac{b_2}{10^2}+\\cdots+\\frac{b_n}{10^n}</math>\nTherefore, the contribution of each digit to the value of a number depends on its position in the numeral. That is, the decimal system is a [[positional numeral system]]\n\n== Decimal fractions ==\n\nThe numbers that are represented by decimal numerals are the '''decimal fractions''' (sometimes called '''decimal numbers'''), that is, the [[rational number]]s that may be expressed as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]], the [[denominator]] of which is a [[exponentiation|power]] of ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Decimal_fraction|title=Decimal Fraction|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Mathematics]]|accessdate=2013-06-18}}</ref> For example, the numerals <math>0.8, 14.89, 0.00024</math> represent the fractions {{math|{{sfrac|8|10}}}}, {{math|{{sfrac|1489|100}}}}, {{math|{{sfrac|24|100000}}}}. More generally, a decimal with {{math|''n''}} digits after the separator represents the fraction with denominator {{math|10<sup>''n''</sup>}}, whose numerator is the integer obtained by removing the separator.\n\nExpressed as a [[fully reduced fraction]], the decimal numbers are those whose denominator is a product of a power of 2 and a power of 5. Thus the smallest denominators of decimal numbers are\n:<math>1=2^0\\cdot 5^0, 2=2^1\\cdot 5^0, 4=2^2\\cdot 5^0, 5=2^0\\cdot 5^1, 8=2^3\\cdot 5^0, 10=2^1\\cdot 5^1, 16=2^4\\cdot 5^0, 25=2^0\\cdot 5^2, \\ldots</math>\n\n<!-- The remainder of the section seems misplaced here -->The ''[[integer part]]'' or ''integral part'' of a decimal is the integer written to the left of the decimal separator (see also [[truncation]]). For a non-negative decimal, it is the largest integer that is not greater than the decimal. The part from the decimal separator to the right is the ''[[fractional part]]'', which equals the difference between the numeral and its integer part.\n\nWhen the integral part of a numeral is zero, it may occur, typically in [[computing]], that the integer part is not written (for example {{math|.1234}}, instead of {{math|0.1234}}). In normal writing, this is generally avoided because of the risk of confusion between the decimal mark and other punctuation.\n\n==Real number approximation==\n\nDecimal numerals do not allow an exact representation for all [[real number]]s, e.g. for the real number [[pi|{{pi}}]]. Nevertheless, they allow approximating every real number with any desired accuracy, e.g., the decimal 3.14159 approximates the real {{pi}}, being less than 10<sup>\u22125</sup> off; and so decimals are widely used in [[science]], [[engineering]] and everyday life.\n\nMore precisely, for every real number ''x'', and every positive integer ''n'', there are two decimals ''L'' and ''u'', with at most ''n'' digits after the decimal mark, such that ''L'' \u2264 ''x'' \u2264 ''u'' and (''u'' \u2013 ''L'') = 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>.\n\nNumbers are very often obtained as the result of a [[measurement]]. As measurements are generally afflicted with some [[measurement error]] with a known [[upper bound]], the result of a measurement is well represented by a decimal with {{math|''n''}} digits after the decimal mark, as soon as the absolute measurement error is bounded from above by 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>. In practice, measurement results are often given with a certain number of digits after the decimal point, which indicate the error bounds. For example, although 0.080 and 0.08 denote the same decimal number, the numeral 0.080 suggests a measurement with an error less than 0.001, while the numeral 0.08 indicates an absolute error bounded by 0.01. In both cases, the true value of the measured quantity could be, for example, 0.0803 or 0.0796 (see also [[significant figures]]).\n\n==Infinite decimal expansion==\n{{main|Decimal representation}}\n\nFor a [[real number]] ''x'' and an integer ''n'' \u2265 0, let [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> denote the (finite) decimal expansion of the greatest number that is not greater than ''x'', which has exactly ''n'' digits after the decimal mark. Let ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> denote the last digit of [''x'']<sub>''i''</sub>. It is straightforward to see that [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> may be obtained by appending ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> to the right of [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub>. This way one has\n:[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> = [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''d''<sub>''n''</sub>,\n\nand the difference of [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub> and [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> amounts to \n:|[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> \u2212 [''x'']<sub>''n''\u20131</sub>| = ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> \u22c5 10<sup>\u2212''n''</sup> < 10<sup>\u2212''n''+1</sup>,\n\nwhich is either 0, if ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0, or gets arbitrarily small, when ''n'' tends to infinity. According to the definition of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]], ''x'' is the limit of [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> when ''n'' tends to [[infinity]]. This is written as <math display=\"inline\">\\; x = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} [x]_n \\;</math> or\n: ''x'' = [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>...,\nwhich is called an '''infinite decimal expansion''' of ''x''.\n\nConversely, for any integer [''x'']<sub>0</sub> and any sequence of digits <math display=\"inline\">\\;(d_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}</math> the (infinite) expression  {{nowrap|[''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>...}} is an ''infinite decimal expansion'' of a real number ''x''. This expansion is  unique if neither all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 9 nor all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 0 for ''n'' large enough (for all ''n'' greater than some natural number ''N'').\n\nIf all ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> for ''n'' > ''N'' equal to 9 and {{nowrap|[''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> {{=}} [''x'']<sub>0</sub>.''d''<sub>1</sub>''d''<sub>2</sub>...''d''<sub>''n''</sub>,}} the limit of the sequence <math display=\"inline\">\\;([x]_n)_{n=1}^{\\infty}</math> is the decimal fraction obtained by replacing the last digit that is not a 9, i.e.: ''d''<sub>''N''</sub>, by ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> + 1, and replacing all subsequent 9s by 0s (see [[0.999...]]).\n\nAny such decimal fraction, i.e., ''d''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0 for ''n'' > ''N'', may be converted to its equivalent infinite decimal expansion by replacing ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> by ''d''<sub>''N''</sub> \u2212 1, and replacing all subsequent 0s by 9s (see [[0.999...]]).\n\nIn summary, every real number that is not a decimal fraction has a unique infinite decimal expansion. Each decimal fraction has exactly two infinite decimal expansions, one containing only 0s after some place, which is obtained by the above definition of [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub>, and the other containing only 9s after some place, which is obtained by defining [''x'']<sub>''n''</sub> as the greatest number that is ''less'' than ''x'', having exactly ''n'' digits after the decimal mark.\n\n=== Rational numbers ===\n{{main|Repeating decimal}}\n\n[[Long division]] allows computing the infinite decimal expansion of a [[rational number]]. If the rational number is a [[#decimal fraction|decimal fraction]], the division stops eventually, producing a decimal numeral, which may be prolongated into an infinite expansion by adding infinitely many zeros. If the rational number is not a decimal fraction, the division may continue indefinitely. However, as all successive remainders are less than the divisor, there are only a finite number of possible remainders, and after some place, the same sequence of digits must be repeated indefinitely in the quotient. That is, one has a ''repeating decimal''. For example,\n:{{sfrac|81}} = 0.&thinsp;012345679&thinsp;012... (with the group 012345679 indefinitely repeating).\n\nConversely, every eventually repeating sequence of digits is the infinite decimal expansion of a rational number. This is a consequence of the fact that the recurring part of a decimal representation is, in fact, an infinite [[geometric series]] which will sum to a rational number. For example,\n:<math>0.0123123123\\ldots =\\frac{123}{10000} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty 0.001^k = \\frac{123}{10000}\\ \\frac{1}{1-0.001} = \\frac{123}{9990} = \\frac{41}{3330}</math>\n\n== Decimal computation ==\n\n[[File:Decimal multiplication table.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Diagram of the world's earliest multiplication table ({{circa}} 305 BC) from the Warring States period]]\n\nMost modern [[computer]] hardware and software systems commonly use a [[Binary numeral system|binary representation]] internally (although many early computers, such as the [[ENIAC]] or the [[IBM 650]], used decimal representation internally).<ref>''Fingers or Fists?

(123.1, for example, is written as such in a computer program, even though many computer languages are unable to encode that number precisely.)\n\nBoth computer hardware and software also use internal representations which are effectively decimal for storing decimal values and doing arithmetic. Often this arithmetic is done on data which are encoded using some variant of [[binary-coded decimal]],<ref name=\"Schmid_1983\">{{cite book |title=Decimal Computation |first=Hermann |author=Schmid<!-- General Electric Company, Binghamton, New York, USA --> |author-link=Hermann Schmid (computer scientist) |orig-year=1974 |date=1983 |edition=1 (reprint) |publisher=Robert E.

Several Indian languages show a straightforward decimal system. Many [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] and [[Dravidian languages]] have numbers between 10 and 20 expressed in a regular pattern of addition to 10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Indian_numerals.html|title=Indian numerals|work=Ancient Indian mathematics|accessdate=2015-05-22}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hungarian language]] also uses a straightforward decimal system. All numbers between 10 and 20 are formed regularly (e.g. 11 is expressed as \"tizenegy\" literally \"one on ten\"), as with those between 20 and 100 (23 as \"huszonh\u00e1rom\" = \"three on twenty\").\n\nA straightforward decimal rank system with a word for each order (10 {{lang|zh|\u5341}}, 100 {{lang|zh|\u767e}}, 1000 {{lang|zh|\u5343}}, 10,000 {{lang|zh|\u4e07}}), and in which 11 is expressed as ''ten-one'' and 23 as ''two-ten-three'', and 89,345 is expressed as 8 (ten thousands) {{lang|zh|\u4e07}} 9 (thousand) {{lang|zh|\u5343}} 3 (hundred) {{lang|zh|\u767e}} 4 (tens) {{lang|zh|\u5341}} 5 is found in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with a few irregularities.  [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], and [[Thai language|Thai]] have imported the Chinese decimal system. Many other languages with a decimal system have special words for the numbers between 10 and 20, and decades. For example, in English 11 is  \"eleven\" not \"ten-one\" or \"one-teen\".\n\nIncan languages such as [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] have an almost straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as ''ten with one'' and 23 as ''two-ten with three''.\n\nSome psychologists suggest irregularities of the English names of numerals may hinder children's counting ability.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Azar| first=Beth| year=1999| title=English words may hinder math skills development| url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr99/english.html  |journal=American Psychology Association Monitor| volume=30| issue=4 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071021015527/http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr99/english.html |archivedate = 2007-10-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Other bases ===\n{{main | positional notation }}\n{{Fundamental info units}}\nSome cultures do, or did, use other bases of numbers.\n* [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures such as the [[Maya numerals|Maya]] used a [[vigesimal|base-20]] system (perhaps based on using all twenty fingers and [[toe]]s).\n* The [[Yuki tribe|Yuki]] language in [[California]] and the Pamean languages<ref>{{Cite journal\n | last=Avelino\n | first=Heriberto\n | title=The typology of Pame number systems and the limits of Mesoamerica as a linguistic area\n | journal=Linguistic Typology\n | year=2006\n | volume=10\n | issue=1\n | pages=41\u201360\n | url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~avelino/Avelino_2006.pdf\n | doi=10.1515/LINGTY.2006.002\n }}</ref> in [[Mexico]] have [[octal|octal (base-8)]] systems because the speakers count using the spaces between their fingers rather than the fingers themselves.<ref>{{cite news|jstor=2686959|title=Ethnomathematics: A Multicultural View of Mathematical Ideas|author=Marcia Ascher|authorlink= Marcia Ascher |publisher=The College Mathematics Journal}}</ref>\n* The existence of a non-decimal base in the earliest traces of the Germanic languages is attested by the presence of words and glosses meaning that the count is in decimal (cognates to \"ten-count\" or \"tenty-wise\"); such would be expected if normal counting is not decimal, and unusual if it were.<ref>{{citation\n | last = McClean | first = R.

The descriptions like \"long\" only appear after the \"small hundred\" of 100 appeared with the Christians. Gordon's [https://www.scribd.com/doc/49127454/Introduction-to-Old-Norse-by-E-V-Gordon Introduction to Old Norse] p 293, gives number names that belong to this system. An expression cognate to 'one hundred and eighty' translates to 200, and the cognate to 'two hundred' translates to 240. [http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_123/123_395_418.pdf Goodare] details the use of the long hundred in Scotland in the Middle Ages, giving examples such as calculations where the carry implies i C (i.e. one hundred) as 120, etc. That the general population were not alarmed to encounter such numbers suggests common enough use. It is also possible to avoid hundred-like numbers by using intermediate units, such as stones and pounds, rather than a long count of pounds. Goodare gives examples of numbers like vii score, where one avoids the hundred by using extended scores. There is also a paper by W.H. Stevenson, on 'Long Hundred and its uses in England'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=W.H.|date=1890|title=The Long Hundred and its uses in England|url=|journal=Archaeological Review|volume=December 1889|pages=313\u2013322|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Poole, Reginald Lane|title=The Exchequer in the twelfth century : the Ford lectures delivered in the University of Oxford in Michaelmas term, 1911|date=2006|publisher=Lawbook Exchange|isbn=1-58477-658-7|location=Clark, N.J.|oclc=76960942}}</ref>\n* Many or all of the [[Chumashan languages]] originally used a [[quaternary numeral system|base-4]] counting system, in which the names for numbers were structured according to multiples of 4 and [[hexadecimal|16]].<ref>There is a surviving list of [[Venture\u00f1o language]] number words up to 32 written down by a Spanish priest ca. 1819. \"Chumashan Numerals\" by Madison S.

Associated with musical genres including [[African popular music|Afropop]], [[jazz]], and [[world music]], she was an advocate against [[apartheid]] and white-minority government in South Africa.\n\nBorn in [[Johannesburg]] to [[Swazi people|Swazi]] and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the [[Manhattan Brothers]], and an all-woman group, [[the Skylarks (South African vocal group)|the Skylarks]], performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film ''[[Come Back, Africa]]'', which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer [[Harry Belafonte]], who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government.\n\nMakeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being \"[[Pata Pata]]\" (1967). Along with Belafonte she received a Grammy Award for her 1965 album ''[[An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba]]''. She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the [[civil rights movement]]. She married [[Stokely Carmichael]], a leader of the [[Black Panther Party]], in 1968. As a result, she lost support among white Americans and faced hostility from the US government, leading her and Carmichael to move to Guinea. She continued to perform, mostly in African countries, including at several [[Decolonization of Africa|independence celebrations]]. She began to write and perform music more explicitly critical of apartheid; the 1977 song \"[[Soweto Blues]]\", written by her former husband [[Hugh Masekela]], was about the [[Soweto uprising]]. After apartheid was dismantled in 1990, Makeba returned to South Africa. She continued recording and performing, including a 1991 album with [[Nina Simone]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and appeared in the 1992 film ''[[Sarafina! (film)|Sarafina!]]''. She was named a UN goodwill ambassador in 1999, and campaigned for humanitarian causes. She died of a heart attack during a 2008 concert in Italy.\n\nMakeba was among the first African musicians to receive worldwide recognition. She brought African music to a Western audience, and popularized the world music and Afropop genres. She also made popular several [[music in the movement against apartheid|songs critical of apartheid]], and became a symbol of opposition to the system, particularly after her right to return was revoked. Upon her death, former South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] said that \"her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us.\"\n\n==Early years==\n===Childhood and family===\nZenzile Miriam Makeba was born on 4 March 1932 in the black [[township (South Africa)|township]] of Prospect, near Johannesburg. Her [[Swazi people|Swazi]] mother, Christina Makeba, was a ''sangoma'', or [[traditional healers of South Africa|traditional healer]], and a [[domestic worker]]. Her [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] father, Caswell Makeba, was a teacher; he died when she was six years old.{{sfn|Allen|2011|loc=Makeba, Miriam Zenzi}}{{sfn|Feldstein|2013|p=34}} Makeba later said that before she was conceived, her mother had been warned that any future pregnancy could be fatal. Neither Miriam nor her mother seemed likely to survive after a difficult labour and delivery. Miriam's grandmother, who attended the birth, often muttered \"uzenzile\", a [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] word that means \"you brought this on yourself\", to Miriam's mother during her recovery, which inspired her to give her daughter the name \"Zenzile\".{{sfn|Carmichael|Thelwell|2003|pp=651\u2013652}}\n\nWhen Makeba was eighteen days old, her mother was arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling [[umqombothi]], a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent the first six months of her life in jail.{{efn|South Africa had complex alcohol regulations which prohibited black South Africans from brewing alcohol, or from consuming it anywhere except beer halls run by local governments. Illegal brewing and consumption was common. The restrictions on consumption were largely removed in the 1960s; the state monopoly on production remained.{{sfn|Blocker|Fahey|Tyrrell|2003|p=12}}}}{{sfn|Feldstein|2013|p=34}}{{sfn|Schwarz-Bart|2003|p=208}}{{sfn|Castledine|2011|p=229}} As a child, Makeba sang in the choir of the Kilnerton Training Institute in [[Pretoria]], an all-black [[Methodism|Methodist]] primary school that she attended for eight years.{{sfn|Feldstein|2013|p=34}}{{sfn|Bordowitz|2006|p=333}} Her talent for singing earned her praise at school.<ref name=\"guardian\"/> Makeba was [[baptism|baptised]] a [[protestant church|Protestant]], and sang in church choirs, in English, Xhosa, [[Sotho language|Sotho]], and [[Zulu language|Zulu]]; she later said that she learned to sing in English before she could speak the language.<ref name=\"Jaggi\" />\n\nThe family moved to the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] when Makeba was a child.

Makeba lived for a while with her grandmother and a large number of cousins in Pretoria.<ref name=\"Jaggi\" /> Makeba was influenced by her family's musical tastes; her mother played several traditional instruments, and her elder brother collected records, including those of [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]], and taught Makeba songs. Her father played the piano, and his musical inclination was later a factor in Makeba's family accepting what was seen as a risque choice of career.<ref name=\"Jaggi\" />\n\nIn 1949, Makeba married James Kubay, a policeman in training, with whom she had her only child, [[Bongi Makeba]], in 1950.

Associated with musical genres including [[African popular music|Afropop]], [[jazz]], and [[world music]], she was an advocate against [[apartheid]] and white-minority government in South Africa.\n\nBorn in [[Johannesburg]] to [[Swazi people|Swazi]] and [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] parents, Makeba was forced to find employment as a child after the death of her father. She had a brief and allegedly abusive first marriage at the age of 17, gave birth to her only child in 1950, and survived breast cancer. Her vocal talent had been recognized when she was a child, and she began singing professionally in the 1950s, with the Cuban Brothers, the [[Manhattan Brothers]], and an all-woman group, [[the Skylarks (South African vocal group)|the Skylarks]], performing a mixture of jazz, traditional African melodies, and Western popular music. In 1959, Makeba had a brief role in the anti-apartheid film ''[[Come Back, Africa]]'', which brought her international attention, and led to her performing in Venice, London, and New York City. In London, she met the American singer [[Harry Belafonte]], who became a mentor and colleague. She moved to New York City, where she became immediately popular, and recorded her first solo album in 1960. Her attempt to return to South Africa that year for her mother's funeral was prevented by the country's government.\n\nMakeba's career flourished in the United States, and she released several albums and songs, her most popular being \"[[Pata Pata]]\" (1967). Along with Belafonte she received a Grammy Award for her 1965 album ''[[An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba]]''. She testified against the South African government at the United Nations and became involved in the [[civil rights movement]]. She married [[Stokely Carmichael]], a leader of the [[Black Panther Party]], in 1968. As a result, she lost support among white Americans and faced hostility from the US government, leading her and Carmichael to move to Guinea. She continued to perform, mostly in African countries, including at several [[Decolonization of Africa|independence celebrations]]. She began to write and perform music more explicitly critical of apartheid; the 1977 song \"[[Soweto Blues]]\", written by her former husband [[Hugh Masekela]], was about the [[Soweto uprising]]. After apartheid was dismantled in 1990, Makeba returned to South Africa. She continued recording and performing, including a 1991 album with [[Nina Simone]] and [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and appeared in the 1992 film ''[[Sarafina! (film)|Sarafina!]]''. She was named a UN goodwill ambassador in 1999, and campaigned for humanitarian causes. She died of a heart attack during a 2008 concert in Italy.\n\nMakeba was among the first African musicians to receive worldwide recognition. She brought African music to a Western audience, and popularized the world music and Afropop genres. She also made popular several [[music in the movement against apartheid|songs critical of apartheid]], and became a symbol of opposition to the system, particularly after her right to return was revoked. Upon her death, former South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] said that \"her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us.\"\n\n==Early years==\n===Childhood and family===\nZenzile Miriam Makeba was born on 4 March 1932 in the black [[township (South Africa)|township]] of Prospect, near Johannesburg. Her [[Swazi people|Swazi]] mother, Christina Makeba, was a ''sangoma'', or [[traditional healers of South Africa|traditional healer]], and a [[domestic worker]]. Her [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] father, Caswell Makeba, was a teacher; he died when she was six years old.{{sfn|Allen|2011|loc=Makeba, Miriam Zenzi}}{{sfn|Feldstein|2013|p=34}} Makeba later said that before she was conceived, her mother had been warned that any future pregnancy could be fatal. Neither Miriam nor her mother seemed likely to survive after a difficult labour and delivery. Miriam's grandmother, who attended the birth, often muttered \"uzenzile\", a [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] word that means \"you brought this on yourself\", to Miriam's mother during her recovery, which inspired her to give her daughter the name \"Zenzile\".{{sfn|Carmichael|Thelwell|2003|pp=651\u2013652}}\n\nWhen Makeba was eighteen days old, her mother was arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling [[umqombothi]], a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent the first six months of her life in jail.{{efn|South Africa had complex alcohol regulations which prohibited black South Africans from brewing alcohol, or from consuming it anywhere except beer halls run by local governments. Illegal brewing and consumption was common. The restrictions on consumption were largely removed in the 1960s; the state monopoly on production remained.{{sfn|Blocker|Fahey|Tyrrell|2003|p=12}}}}{{sfn|Feldstein|2013|p=34}}{{sfn|Schwarz-Bart|2003|p=208}}{{sfn|Castledine|2011|p=229}} As a child, Makeba sang in the choir of the Kilnerton Training Institute in [[Pretoria]], an all-black [[Methodism|Methodist]] primary school that she attended for eight years.{{sfn|Feldstein|2013|p=34}}{{sfn|Bordowitz|2006|p=333}} Her talent for singing earned her praise at school.<ref name=\"guardian\"/> Makeba was [[baptism|baptised]] a [[protestant church|Protestant]], and sang in church choirs, in English, Xhosa, [[Sotho language|Sotho]], and [[Zulu language|Zulu]]; she later said that she learned to sing in English before she could speak the language.<ref name=\"Jaggi\" />\n\nThe family moved to the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] when Makeba was a child.

Her father played the piano, and his musical inclination was later a factor in Makeba's family accepting what was seen as a risque choice of career.<ref name=\"Jaggi\" />\n\nIn 1949, Makeba married James Kubay, a policeman in training, with whom she had her only child, [[Bongi Makeba]], in 1950.

While legislation permits withdrawals from the fund from 1 July 2020, the government indicated in 2017 it intends to allow the fund to continue to accumulate until at least 2026/27 before making withdrawals. The Investment Mandate<ref>https://www.futurefund.gov.au/investment/how-we-invest/investment-mandates</ref> for the Future Fund is to target a benchmark return of at least the Consumer Price Index + 4 to 5 per cent per annum over the long term, while taking an acceptable but not excessive level of risk. \n\nThe Future Fund Board is currently also responsible for five other Australian sovereign wealth funds:\n* [[Building Australia Fund]] \u2013 An infrastructure fund to provide investment in infrastructure projects (including road, rail, ports and broadband). At 30 June 2018, it was valued at A$3.9 billion.\n* [[Education Investment Fund]] \u2013 A fund to provide capital investment in higher education and vocational education and training. At 30 June 2018, it was valued at A$3.9 billion.\n* [[DisabilityCare Australia Fund]] \u2013 A fund to contribute to the cost of the [[National Disability Insurance Scheme]]. At 30 June 2018, it was valued at A$14.7 billion.\n* [[Medical Research Future Fund]] \u2013 A fund to disperse interest generated to medical research. At 30 June 2018, it was valued at A$7.18 billion.\n* [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land and Sea Future Fund]] (ATSILS Fund) \u2013 A fund to enhance the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to make payments to the Indigenous Land Corporation.

At 12:36 AM EDT on July 1, 2018, ''Fantage'' closed down its servers to all users.\n\n== History ==\nAccording to Dean Takahashi of [[VentureBeat]], ''Fantage'' began development after the founders of the game, David Hwang and Peter Bae, created their company in January 2007, and the game was initially an educational math website until they received negative reception from a focus group of kids.<ref name=\"success\">{{Cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/09/18/watch-out-disney-fantage-doubles-its-growth-for-kids-virtual-world/ |title=Watch out, Disney, Fantage doubles its growth for kids virtual world |date=2010-09-18 |last=Takahashi |first=Dean |work=[[VentureBeat]] |accessdate=2010-09-19}}</ref><ref name=\"formallaunch\">{{cite web|last1=Takahashi|first1=Dean|title=With 3 million fans, Fantage formally launches virtual world for kids|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/10/19/fantage-formally-launches-virtual-world-for-kids/|website=VentureBeat|accessdate=4 May 2018|date=19 October 2009}}</ref> A closed beta version of the game was available on October 29, 2007, which granted beta testers full access to features normally available through a paid membership, and the game went open beta on January 1, 2008.<ref name=\"publication date\"/> The game eventually released on March 17, 2008, where beta testers were gifted with a month of free membership, 1,000 Stars, and exclusive Beta Tester hair items, while new members received 2 weeks of free membership.<ref name=\"publication date\"/>\n\nIn 2009\u20132010, ''Fantage'' received strategic investments from [[Nexon]].<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sramanamitra.com/2010/06/15/deal-radar-2010-fantage/ |title=Deal Radar 2010: Fantage |date=2010-06-15 |last=Mitra |first=Sramana |work=Sramana Mitra on Strategy |accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref> These investments allowed ''Fantage'' to hire additional designers and key developers. The resulting site expansion and quality enhancement led to swift growth. In less than four months, from November 2009 to February 2010, ''Fantage'' completed the entire site renewal, which involved upgrades of more than thirty mini-games. Within a year, the user base grew from 3 million to 7.7 million registered users.<ref name=\"success\"/>\n\n''Fantage'' developed and employed its own real time mass data processing technology, which enables 20 million users to access the site without any inconvenience. This database and server side program was created by Byungsoo Son, Frank Kim, Sungwon Um, and Dongpyo Lee, who were all key developers for the game. Fantage Inc. is currently headquartered in Fort Lee, New Jersey and run by Nexon.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n=== Discontinuation ===\n[[File:Fantage_Farewell_Party.png|thumb|right|The message Fantage's development team left for the game's users regarding the game's discontinuation.]]\nOn May 17, 2018, ''Fantage'' announced that the game would be permanently closed on June 30, 2018.<ref name=\"discontinuation\">{{cite web|last1=Takahashi|first1=Dean|title=Fantage kids virtual world will shut after 10 years|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/27/fantage-kids-virtual-world-will-shut-after-10-years/|website=VentureBeat|accessdate=27 May 2018|date=27 May 2018}}</ref> The game stopped receiving membership payments as of May 17, 2018, and the game's payment page and related mobile apps have been closed down. In commemoration of the game's discontinuation, the game hosted its last event, called \"Farewell Party\", which ran through May 17 through May 23, 2018. Users were given free items on each day of the event they have logged into the game, and Premium Membership was given to all users from June 1 through June 30, 2018. ''Fantage'' finally closed its doors on July 1, 2018 at 12:36 AM.\n\n=== Overseas ===\nOn December 14, 2009, it was reported on a Japanese online gaming news site, ''Game Watch,'' that Nexon was releasing ''Fantage'' in [[Japan]] in February 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ishii|first1=Satoshi|title=\u30a6\u30a7\u30d6\u30de\u30cd\u30fc\u3001\u521d\u306e\u5927\u898f\u6a21\u30aa\u30d5\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u300cONLINE GAME messe.2009\u300d\u3092\u958b\u50ac \u300cWebMoney Award 2009\u300d\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea\u306f\u300c\u30a2\u30e9\u30c9\u6226\u8a18\u300d\u3002\u300cDragon Nest\u300d\u3001\u300c\u304a\u3057\u3083\u3089\u3093\u3069 \u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u300d\u3001\u300c\u5927\u6226\u7565Web\u300d\u306a\u3069\u5404\u793e\u306e\u65b0\u4f5c\u3082\u7d9a\u3005\u767a\u8868|url=https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/event/335861.html|website=Game Watch|publisher=Impress Corporation|accessdate=2 December 2017|language=Japanese|date=14 December 2009}}</ref> The game was eventually released on February 10, 2010 as {{Nihongo|\"Oshare Land Fantage\"|\u304a\u3057\u3083\u3089\u3093\u3069\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8|}},<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ishii|first1=Satoshi|title=FANTAGE CEO David Hwang\u6c0f\u306b\u300c\u304a\u3057\u3083\u3089\u3093\u3069\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u300d\u306e\u65e5\u672c\u6226\u7565\u3092\u805e\u304f \u7c73\u56fd\u3067\u5973\u306e\u5b50\u306b\u4eba\u6c17\u306e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b3\u30df\u30e5\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3\u304c\u3064\u3044\u306b\u65e5\u672c\u4e0a\u9678\uff01|url=https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/349784.html|website=Game Watch|publisher=Impress Corporation|accessdate=2 December 2017|language=Japanese|date=18 February 2010}}</ref> which was nicknamed \"Fantage Japan\" by players outside of Japan. As Nexon of Japan owned this version of the game, a Nexon Japan ID was required to create an account and to log in, and Nexon Points were used as another currency for the game. Some features from the game made for this version eventually were released internationally, such as two eye sets and some clothing items (though they were altered somewhat for unknown reasons). Notable features exclusive to this version of the game were Rare items being accessible from shops (they are normally available by gem combinations in the original game), the absence of a paid membership, and Magic Boxes, which contained special items. ''Oshare Land Fantage'' shut down on December 15, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u300c\u304a\u3057\u3083\u3089\u3093\u3069\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u300d\u30b5\u30fc\u30d3\u30b9\u7d42\u4e86\u306e\u304a\u77e5\u3089\u305b|url=http://www.nexon.co.jp/end/fantage/|publisher=Nexon Co, Ltd|accessdate=2 December 2017|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nNixon of Europe released a version of ''Fantage'' for European users in 2010, and similar to ''Oshare Land Fantage,'' the game required a Nexon Europe ID to create an account.

Their apps were available on [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[Google Play]], with a few exceptions not being available on Google Play. In 2014, ''Fantage'' released an iPad app called ''Fantage Comet'', which was similar to the original game, but took place on a different area. Like some of the other apps, ''Fantage Comet'' was compatible with the original game, where users were able to log in and buy exclusive items from the app that could also be used into the online game. In recent times, many of the apps received negative reception from players. The company's Google Play page was shut down upon announcement of the game's closure.\n\n== Business model ==\n''Fantage'' started out as a self-funded organization, but the company later received an infusion of capital from Nexon.<ref name=\"nexon\">{{cite news |url=http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2009/10/fantage-official-launch-announced.html |title=,Fantage Official Launched Announced |date=2009-10-19 |last=Ashby |first=Alicia |work=Virtual Worlds News |access-date=2010-09-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418200223/http://www.virtualworldsnews.com/2009/10/fantage-official-launch-announced.html |archive-date=2010-04-18 |df= }}</ref> Initial admission into ''Fantage'' was free and users can continue to use it as such; however, premium membership is required to access the full site including most clothing items, rare items, most gems, customization options, and most pets.\n\nUsers also can purchase eCoins or Gold, which are additional currencies alongside Stars, in bulk amounts for set fees to use in-game for micro transactions. eCoins and Gold can be used to purchase almost every item, but only eCoins can be used to buy pet codes to speed up pet hatching,<ref name=\"'\">{{cite news  |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/60157/Fantage_Introduces_New_Microtransaction_System_andBilltoMobiletrade_Payment_Option.php |title=Fantage Introduces New Microtransaction System and BilltoMobile\u2122 Payment Option  |date=2010-06-22 |accessdate=2011-11-11}}</ref> while only Gold can be used to purchase Limited items and items from other players in MyMall, an area in the game that provides users with premium membership the ability to sell items.\n\n== Environment ==\n[[File:Screenshot_of_Fantage_ingame_environment.png|thumb|right|Screenshot of in-game environment]]{{More citations needed section|date=May 2019|talk=The Environment section has no citations.}}\nOnce users created an account, they were given a basic tutorial and eventually a few items and a basic house. To move around in the world, players would click on where they wanted their avatar to go.<ref name=\"official blog FAQ\"/> Players had the option of opening their home to everyone, just their buddies, or no one other than the owner themselves. Players were also given ID Cards (later changed to IDfones, which were initially called \"myFones\" in 2009<ref>{{cite web |title=myFone |url=http://blog.fantage.com/?p=450 |website=Fantage.com Official Blog |publisher=Fantage |access-date=August 13, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618055447/http://blog.fantage.com/?p=450 |archive-date=June 18, 2009 |date=April 14, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>), which were accessible by clicking on the user's avatar and provided information about said user, such as the amount of in-game money the user had<ref name=\"official blog FAQ\"/> or the player's overall level, which was made up by the Medals the player earned for their user.<ref>{{cite web |title=MEDALS!

Fantage, Castle, Carnival, Beach, Forest, Fantage School, Pet Town, User Home, Sea Breeze, Lighthouse, and the Island; inside most of these main areas had additional smaller areas, such as shops and areas containing mini-games. There were several shops where players could purchase items with any of ''Fantage's'' 3 currencies; Stars, eCoins and Gold. Stars could be earned by playing games;<ref name=\"official blog FAQ\"/> eCoins by buying with real money,<ref>{{cite web |title=Fantage: eCoin transaction system rolled out to the virtual playground. |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/fantage-ecoin-transaction-system-rolled-out-to-the-virtual-playground |website=GamesIndustry.biz |publisher=Gamer Network |accessdate=August 13, 2019 |date=June 22, 2010}}</ref> watching advertisements, or daily check-in; and Gold by buying, or through a transfer system in MyMall.\n\n=== Games ===\n''Fantage'' had a selection of mini-games, some of which were multiplayer games. Some of the website's notable games were Top Models Fashion Show (a [[fashion show]] game), Splash! (a [[water balloons|water balloon]] game), and Rocket Board (a [[roller coaster]] game). Users would earn a quantity of Stars depending on the player's score. After 2014's \"Fantage Cataclysm\" event, an event for the game's 6th anniversary that also included additions to the game's lore and a new redesign for the game's map, most of the mini-games in ''Fantage'' were compiled and moved to the Retro Arcade, located at the Carnival area.\n\nThere was also the Creature Area, which had contained the Creature Arena and Creature Shop. Users could enter as a Creature purchasable from the Creature Shop and play with a variety of trampolines, cannons, and other things while collecting Stars. After the \"Fantage Cataclysm\", the Creature Area was removed, with the Creature Arena and Creature Shop being moved to the Forest.\n\n=== Pets ===\nIn 2010, ''Fantage'' introduced Pets and the Pet Town to players. Users could collect pets by purchasing and hatching eggs or by using pet codes. Premium Members could hatch all pets using eggs; non-Premium members could only hatch two pets using eggs. Users who obtained eCoins were able to purchase Magic Codes to hatch a specific pet they wanted and at a faster rate. There were three magic code hatching times available 1 hour, 20 minute, or Instant. Occasionally, ''Fantage'' would release certain holiday-themed eggs that premium members can buy for a certain number of stars to get limited holiday pets. An additional family, Codies, were only available by collecting and assembling multiple items from Captain Cody, Fantage's resident superhero.\n\nPremium members also had the option to have their pets trail behind them as they explored ''Fantage'' and to let pets wander on the first floor of their home. All users could use their pets for Pet Games, which were located in the Pet Town area that specifically features pets. For players without pets (or enough pets, in the case of one game, Wild Rumble), Pet Games would lend them a pet to play with. The Top Models Fashion Show game was eventually updated to allow all users to use their pets to earn more points.\n\n=== Farming ===\nIn 2013, ''Fantage'' introduced Farms to all players. Farms were accessible from the player's house or through their IDfone. Players were given 3 plots of land to plant seeds of various plants, which could be bought with Stars and planted with Sun Energy. After a specified period of time, the resulting crops could be harvested with Sun Energy to earn Stars. Farming also gave points to a certain Farming medal for the user's overall level.\n\nMuch like [[FarmVille]], players had to wait real time for plants to grow and could have helped out farms belonging to other players. Players could help out an unlimited number of people a day, but each farm could only be helped out 3 times per day.\n\n=== Mission Center ===\n''Fantage'' had a Mission Center where players could participate in Missions. There were various Missions for users to play from and each Mission could be replayed once they were finished at least once. Upon completion (or re-completion) of a Mission, players were rewarded with points on their Mission Medal,<ref>{{cite web |title=Mission Medals! |url=http://blog.fantage.com/?p=1052 |website=Fantage.com Official Blog |publisher=Fantage |accessdate=August 13, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808061911/http://blog.fantage.com/?p=1052 |archivedate=August 8, 2009 |date=August 5, 2009}}</ref> which, like all Medals, counts toward the overall level of the user. Many of these missions had segments with mini-games and puzzles, which must be completed in order to progress further into the mission. These missions were often related to the creation of certain areas, such as the Lighthouse being created for the Mad Scientist mission, and some have provided some characterization to ''Fantage's'' [[NPCs]].\n\n=== Parties and socialization ===\nUsers may add up to 200 friends, or \"buddies\", and chat through instant messenger one-to-one or through a group chat.<ref name=\"official blog FAQ\"/> Users could also click on a player's avatar and click the ignore button, so that the ignored user's chat won't be seen to the player. Users could delete a buddy any time. If any user is bullying or using inappropriate behavior, players may click on the report button and the reported user is immediately ignored.<ref name=\"official blog FAQ\"/>\n\n''Fantage's'' chat system allowed players to have one of three chat modes set on their avatar. The first mode, \"Fantage Chat\", was the normal mode where users can chat freely, though some messages will be filtered and will not be visible to others if they contain private information. The second mode, \"Safe Chat\", has the normal chat bubble disabled in favor of limited chat phrases, and was the mode recommended to parents concerned for their children during the game's run. The third mode, \"No Chat\", completely disables the user from chatting or seeing others chat in the game.<ref name=\"official blog FAQ\"/>\n\nParties were later introduced in 2010 and could be used to invite large numbers of people to the player's house. Players may choose the theme of the party and whether the party was for everyone in the server or their friends (with later features allowing different music tracks to be played). Only one party could only be hosted at a time, even if the player leaves one server and tries to create another party in another server. Hosting a party costs 50 Stars, but players could buy additional features to the party, such as pi\u00f1atas and exclusive party-themed stickers.

After the \"Fantage Cataclysm\", the Creature Area was removed, with the Creature Arena and Creature Shop being moved to the Forest.\n\n=== Pets ===\nIn 2010, ''Fantage'' introduced Pets and the Pet Town to players. Users could collect pets by purchasing and hatching eggs or by using pet codes. Premium Members could hatch all pets using eggs; non-Premium members could only hatch two pets using eggs. Users who obtained eCoins were able to purchase Magic Codes to hatch a specific pet they wanted and at a faster rate. There were three magic code hatching times available 1 hour, 20 minute, or Instant. Occasionally, ''Fantage'' would release certain holiday-themed eggs that premium members can buy for a certain number of stars to get limited holiday pets. An additional family, Codies, were only available by collecting and assembling multiple items from Captain Cody, Fantage's resident superhero.\n\nPremium members also had the option to have their pets trail behind them as they explored ''Fantage'' and to let pets wander on the first floor of their home. All users could use their pets for Pet Games, which were located in the Pet Town area that specifically features pets. For players without pets (or enough pets, in the case of one game, Wild Rumble), Pet Games would lend them a pet to play with. The Top Models Fashion Show game was eventually updated to allow all users to use their pets to earn more points.\n\n=== Farming ===\nIn 2013, ''Fantage'' introduced Farms to all players. Farms were accessible from the player's house or through their IDfone. Players were given 3 plots of land to plant seeds of various plants, which could be bought with Stars and planted with Sun Energy. After a specified period of time, the resulting crops could be harvested with Sun Energy to earn Stars. Farming also gave points to a certain Farming medal for the user's overall level.\n\nMuch like [[FarmVille]], players had to wait real time for plants to grow and could have helped out farms belonging to other players. Players could help out an unlimited number of people a day, but each farm could only be helped out 3 times per day.\n\n=== Mission Center ===\n''Fantage'' had a Mission Center where players could participate in Missions. There were various Missions for users to play from and each Mission could be replayed once they were finished at least once. Upon completion (or re-completion) of a Mission, players were rewarded with points on their Mission Medal,<ref>{{cite web |title=Mission Medals! |url=http://blog.fantage.com/?p=1052 |website=Fantage.com Official Blog |publisher=Fantage |accessdate=August 13, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090808061911/http://blog.fantage.com/?p=1052 |archivedate=August 8, 2009 |date=August 5, 2009}}</ref> which, like all Medals, counts toward the overall level of the user. Many of these missions had segments with mini-games and puzzles, which must be completed in order to progress further into the mission. These missions were often related to the creation of certain areas, such as the Lighthouse being created for the Mad Scientist mission, and some have provided some characterization to ''Fantage's'' [[NPCs]].\n\n=== Parties and socialization ===\nUsers may add up to 200 friends, or \"buddies\", and chat through instant messenger one-to-one or through a group chat.<ref name=\"official blog FAQ\"/> Users could also click on a player's avatar and click the ignore button, so that the ignored user's chat won't be seen to the player. Users could delete a buddy any time. If any user is bullying or using inappropriate behavior, players may click on the report button and the reported user is immediately ignored.<ref name=\"official blog FAQ\"/>\n\n''Fantage's'' chat system allowed players to have one of three chat modes set on their avatar. The first mode, \"Fantage Chat\", was the normal mode where users can chat freely, though some messages will be filtered and will not be visible to others if they contain private information. The second mode, \"Safe Chat\", has the normal chat bubble disabled in favor of limited chat phrases, and was the mode recommended to parents concerned for their children during the game's run. The third mode, \"No Chat\", completely disables the user from chatting or seeing others chat in the game.<ref name=\"official blog FAQ\"/>\n\nParties were later introduced in 2010 and could be used to invite large numbers of people to the player's house. Players may choose the theme of the party and whether the party was for everyone in the server or their friends (with later features allowing different music tracks to be played). Only one party could only be hosted at a time, even if the player leaves one server and tries to create another party in another server. Hosting a party costs 50 Stars, but players could buy additional features to the party, such as pi\u00f1atas and exclusive party-themed stickers. Parties were previously limited to premium members, but in 2014, all users were able to host their own parties.\n\n=== Education and charity ===\nThe Fantage School was introduced in 2011 as a new area with a variety of educational mini-games, ranging from math and chess to language arts and geography.<ref name=\"Fantage School\">{{cite web|title=Teacher Page|url=http://www.fantage.com/fun/teacher_page.html|website=Fantage|publisher=Fantage Inc|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216031317/http://www.fantage.com/fun/teacher_page.html|archive-date=2 January 2017|access-date=2 December 2017}}</ref> The first floor contained art, math, social studies, and language arts, while the second floor had chess, checkers, and a trivia game. The bottom floor also contained an area where players could create their own Private Classrooms, where groups of players can enter and try to beat each other's scores on the mini-games provided in this area.\n\n''Fantage'' has collaborated with a school in [[Los Angeles]] in 2012, where a fifth-grade class would participate in the \"Fantage School Challenge.\"<ref name=\"Fantage School\"/><ref name=\"23 January 2012\">{{cite web|last1=Takahashi|first1=Dean|title=Fantage recruits schools one by one for kids online virtual learning world|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/01/23/fantage-recruits-schools-one-by-one-for-kids-online-virtual-learning-world/|website=VentureBeat|accessdate=2 December 2017}}</ref> The challenge consists of the fifth-grade class being separated into two teams, where they would play ''Fantage's'' educational games to see which team had the better scores.\n\n''Fantage'' has also held events in the past where users can donate their Stars to charity.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ford|first1=Suzie|title=Kids Making a Difference|url=https://www.mmorpg.com/fantage/news/kids-making-a-difference-1000023027|website=MMORPG.com|publisher=Cyber Creations Inc.|accessdate=5 May 2018|date=22 December 2011}}</ref> Some charity sites the game has been noted to work with include [[Child's Play (charity)|Child's Play]] in 2011 and [[K.I.D.S./Fashion Delivers|Delivering Good]] (which was known then as K.I.D.S.) in 2013.\n\n==Reception==\nWithin its first few years of launch, ''Fantage'' has gained positive reviews, with most of the praise going towards the game's kid-friendly environment. On March 9, 2010, Fantage received the Editor's Choice Award from the Children's Technology Review for excellence in children's interactive media, with the website's review on the game saying: \"Fantage, or 'fantastic age' is a responsive, safe and no-fail MMO that resembles [[Club Penguin]] back in the good old days.\"<ref name=\"ctr\">{{Cite web |url=http://childrenstech.com/blog/archives/1568 |title=Fantage |date=2010-03-09 |last=Dellafave |first=Lisa |work=Children's Technology Review |accessdate=2010-09-23}}</ref> Dean Takahashi of VentureBeat notes that Fantage offers \"fun games and social activities in a safe, parent-friendly setting\", and how the game developed much more than 200 kid-friendly virtual world games that were then reported of being under development.<ref name=\"formallaunch\"/> A user on GamersInfo.net by the name of \"Alladania\" states that the game \"has the potential to be more socially involving than games for the younger set but has enough other things going on that a lot of social chit-chat isn\u2019t a requirement to have fun.\"<ref name=\"gi\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamersinfo.net/articles/3355-fantage |title=Review: Fantage |date=2010-07-11 |author=Alladania |work=Gamers' Info |access-date=2010-07-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724190525/http://www.gamersinfo.net/articles/3355-fantage |archive-date=2010-07-24 |df= }}</ref> Jo McClelland of [[Time (magazine)|TIME]] has acknowledged the site as one of the best social networks for preteens.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McClelland|first1=Jo|title=The Best Social Networks for Kids Under 13|url=http://techland.time.com/2012/05/24/the-best-social-networks-for-kids-under-13/|website=Time|accessdate=4 May 2018|date=24 May 2012}}</ref> Carolina Ribeiro of Portuguese online magazine ''TechTudo'' believes the game can be enjoyed by kids while protecting their real identity and appearance with the game's avatars.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ribeiro|first1=Carolina|title=No Dia da Crian\u00e7a, confira as redes sociais feitas s\u00f3 para os pequenos|url=http://www.techtudo.com.br/artigos/noticia/2012/10/dicas-de-redes-sociais-para-o-dia-das-criancas.html|website=TechTudo|publisher=Globo.com|accessdate=4 May 2018|language=Portuguese|date=12 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Revival==\n\n=== Fantage Legacy ===\nA day after Fantage announced their discontinuation, rumors of an attempt to recreate Fantage's environment by creating a private server with the game's files surfaced.<ref name=\"discontinuation\" /> This project was then confirmed under the name '''''Fantage Legacy'''.''

The flashback sequences are done in 2D animation, while the beginning and end are done in the same CGI as the main ''Doc McStuffins'' episodes.\n{{Episode table |background=orange |overall= |title= |airdate= |episodes =\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| Title           = Blurry Night\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|04|15}}\n| ShortSummary    = ''Patient:'' Aurora \n| LineColor       = orange\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Run Down Rotors\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|09|27}}\n| ShortSummary    =  ''Patient:'' Rescue Ronda\n| LineColor       = orange\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Sticky Slippies\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|09|13}}\n| ShortSummary    = ''Patient:'' Stuffy\n| LineColor       = orange\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 4\n| Title           = The Lamb's Exam\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|09|06}}\n| ShortSummary    = ''Patient:'' Lambie\n| LineColor       = orange\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Bella's Bath\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|07|22}}\n| ShortSummary    = ''Patient:'' Bella\n| LineColor       = orange\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Boppy's Boo Boo\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|07|23}}\n| ShortSummary    = ''Patient:'' Boppy\n----\n'''Note:''' Boppy was also known as \"Bobby\" in this short episode.\n| LineColor       = orange\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| Title           = Chilly McWillies\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|07|24}}\n| ShortSummary    = ''Patient:'' Chilly\n| LineColor       = orange\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 8\n| Title           = Hippo's Rip\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|07|25}}\n| ShortSummary    = ''Patient:'' Hallie\n| LineColor       = orange\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| Title           = Gustov's Gulp\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|07|26}}\n| ShortSummary    = ''Patient:'' Gustov\n| LineColor       = orange\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| Title           = Mr. Chomp's Chompers\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2013|09|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = ''Patient:'' Mr. Chomp\n| LineColor       = orange\n}}\n}}\n\n==Shorts==\n===Doc Toy Hospital: Pet Rescue===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! #\n!
