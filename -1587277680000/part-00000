It would be a worldwide scandal I had no idea until then. I asked for the two twin sisters, who had not been presented and who were with the men's Olympic team, concentrated in a hotel. Then came two guys and they prodded me: \"These are the two sisters\". I replied, \"You are joking, they are men\". Then they trained and I asked the doctor to examine them, because I was sure that they were men. He was there and he found that they were men. Even they had been champions of the African Cup and everything else. At the time, I asked to send them back to Burkina Faso - they were naturalized - and to talk that one of them had hurt the knee and the other sister had gone along because she did not want to stay away. I cut the duo from the national team, as everyone expected their presence. When (this situation) arrived at the time of the interview, I needed to talk about that.}}</ref>\n\n==Players==\n===Current squad===\nThe next are some of the players who competed at the 2020 UNIFFAC Women's Cup.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=EUDLlamoro|number=1000004550273781760|date=25 May 2018|title=Nove (F\u00e9minas) con la Selecci\u00f3n Nacional Femenina de la Rep\u00fablica de Guinea Ecuatorial.

Around April 2011, they were removed from national team by the Italian-born Brazilian coach Marcelo Frigerio, who had recently assumed, just a few months before participating in the World Cup. Since then, the Simpor\u00e9 siblings never were called-up.

It would be a worldwide scandal I had no idea until then. I asked for the two twin sisters, who had not been presented and who were with the men's Olympic team, concentrated in a hotel. Then came two guys and they prodded me: \"These are the two sisters\". I replied, \"You are joking, they are men\". Then they trained and I asked the doctor to examine them, because I was sure that they were men. He was there and he found that they were men. Even they had been champions of the African Cup and everything else. At the time, I asked to send them back to Burkina Faso - they were naturalized - and to talk that one of them had hurt the knee and the other sister had gone along because she did not want to stay away. I cut the duo from the national team, as everyone expected their presence. When (this situation) arrived at the time of the interview, I needed to talk about that.}}</ref>\n\n==Players==\n===Current squad===\nThe next are some of the players who competed at the 2020 UNIFFAC Women's Cup.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=EUDLlamoro|number=1000004550273781760|date=25 May 2018|title=Nove (F\u00e9minas) con la Selecci\u00f3n Nacional Femenina de la Rep\u00fablica de Guinea Ecuatorial.
