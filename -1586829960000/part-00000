A reactive [[tuberculin]] skin test is a contraindication to BCG. Someone with a positive tuberculin reaction is not given BCG, because the risk of severe local inflammation and scarring is high, not because of the common misconception that tuberculin reactors \"are already immune\" and therefore do not need BCG. People found to have reactive tuberculin skin tests should be screened for active tuberculosis. BCG is also contraindicated in certain people who have IL-12 receptor pathway defects.\n\nBCG is given as a single [[intradermal]] injection at the insertion of the [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]]. If BCG is accidentally given [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, then a local abscess may form (a \"BCG-oma\") that can sometimes ulcerate, and may require treatment with [[antibiotics]] immediately, otherwise without treatment it could spread the infection causing severe damage to vital organs. An abscess is not always associated with incorrect administration, and it is one of the more common complications that can occur with the vaccination. Numerous medical studies on treatment of these abscesses with antibiotics have been done with varying results, but the consensus is once pus is aspirated and analysed, provided no unusual bacilli are present, the abscess will generally heal on its own in a matter of weeks.<ref>Nick Makwana and Andrew Riordan (2004), \"Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses?\", Birmingham Heartlands Hospital {{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |title=BestBets: Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses? |accessdate=2007-04-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216053220/http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |archivedate=2007-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe characteristic raised scar that BCG immunization leaves is often used as proof of prior immunization.

Nonetheless, the buttock is an alternative site of administration because it provides better cosmetic outcomes.\n\nBCG vaccine should be given [[intradermal]]ly. If given [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, it may induce local infection and spread to the regional [[lymph nodes]], causing either suppurative (production of [[pus]]) and non-suppurative [[lymphadenitis]]. Conservative management is usually adequate for non-suppurative lymphadenitis. If suppuration occurs, it may need [[needle aspiration]].

Sometimes the powder is sealed with vacuum in a glass ampoule. Such a glass ampoule has to be opened slowly to prevent the airflow from blowing out the powder. Then the powder has to be diluted with saline water before injecting.\n\n==History==\n[[File:BCG advert.jpg|thumb|French poster promoting the BCG vaccine]]\nThe history of BCG is tied to that of [[smallpox]].  [[Jean Antoine Villemin]] first recognized bovine tuberculosis in 1854 and transmitted it, and [[Robert Koch]] first distinguished ''Mycobacterium bovis'' from ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.  Following the success of [[vaccination]] in preventing smallpox, established during the 18th century, scientists thought to find a corollary in tuberculosis by drawing a parallel between bovine tuberculosis and [[cowpox]]:  it was hypothesized that infection with bovine tuberculosis might protect against infection with human tuberculosis.  In the late 19th century, clinical trials using ''M. bovis'' were conducted in Italy with disastrous results, because ''M. bovis'' was found to be just as virulent as ''M. tuberculosis''.\n\n[[Albert Calmette]], a French physician and bacteriologist, and his assistant and later colleague, [[Camille Gu\u00e9rin]], a veterinarian, were working at the [[Institut Pasteur de Lille]] ([[Lille]], France) in 1908.  Their work included subculturing virulent strains of the tuberculosis bacillus and testing different culture media. They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew bacilli that seemed less virulent, and changed the course of their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine. The BCG strain was isolated after subculturing 239 times during 13 years from virulent strain on glycerine potato medium.  The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent bacilli were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals.  Calmette and Guerin transferred to the Paris [[Pasteur Institute]] in 1919.  The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Fine PE, Carneiro IA, Milstein JB, Clements CJ | title=Issues relating to the use of BCG in immunization programs | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | year=1999 | location=Geneva }}</ref>\n\nPublic acceptance was slow, and one disaster, in particular, did much to harm public acceptance of the vaccine. In the summer of 1930 in [[L\u00fcbeck]], 240 infants were vaccinated in the first 10 days of life; almost all developed tuberculosis and 72 infants died. It was subsequently discovered that the BCG administered there had been contaminated with a virulent strain that was being stored in the same incubator, which led to legal action against the manufacturers of the vaccine.<ref>{{cite book | author=Rosenthal SR. | title=BCG vaccination against tuberculosis | publisher=Little, Brown & Co. | location=Boston | year=1957 }}</ref>\n\nDr. [[R.G. Ferguson]], working at the [[Fort San, Saskatchewan|Fort Qu'Appelle Sanatorium]] in Saskatchewan, was among the pioneers in developing the practice of vaccination against tuberculosis. In 1928, BCG was adopted by the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] (predecessor to the [[World Health Organization]] [WHO]).  Because of opposition, however, it only became widely used after World War II.  From 1945 to 1948, relief organizations (International Tuberculosis Campaign or Joint Enterprises) vaccinated over 8 million babies in [[eastern Europe]] and prevented the predicted typical increase of TB after a major war.\n\nBCG is very efficacious against [[tuberculous meningitis]] in the pediatric age group, but its efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis appears to be variable. As of 2006, only a few countries do not use BCG for routine vaccination. Two countries that have never used it routinely are the United States and the Netherlands (in both countries, it is felt that having a reliable [[Mantoux test]] and therefore being able to accurately detect active disease is more beneficial to society than vaccinating against a condition that is now relatively rare there).<ref>{{cite web

A reactive [[tuberculin]] skin test is a contraindication to BCG. Someone with a positive tuberculin reaction is not given BCG, because the risk of severe local inflammation and scarring is high, not because of the common misconception that tuberculin reactors \"are already immune\" and therefore do not need BCG. People found to have reactive tuberculin skin tests should be screened for active tuberculosis. BCG is also contraindicated in certain people who have IL-12 receptor pathway defects.\n\nBCG is given as a single [[intradermal]] injection at the insertion of the [[Deltoid muscle|deltoid]]. If BCG is accidentally given [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, then a local abscess may form (a \"BCG-oma\") that can sometimes ulcerate, and may require treatment with [[antibiotics]] immediately, otherwise without treatment it could spread the infection causing severe damage to vital organs. An abscess is not always associated with incorrect administration, and it is one of the more common complications that can occur with the vaccination. Numerous medical studies on treatment of these abscesses with antibiotics have been done with varying results, but the consensus is once pus is aspirated and analysed, provided no unusual bacilli are present, the abscess will generally heal on its own in a matter of weeks.<ref>Nick Makwana and Andrew Riordan (2004), \"Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses?\", Birmingham Heartlands Hospital {{cite web |url=http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |title=BestBets: Is medical therapy effective in the treatment of BCG abscesses? |accessdate=2007-04-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216053220/http://www.bestbets.org/cgi-bin/bets.pl?record=00797 |archivedate=2007-02-16 }}</ref>\n\nThe characteristic raised scar that BCG immunization leaves is often used as proof of prior immunization.

The main adverse effects are [[keloid]]s&mdash;large, raised scars. The insertion to the [[deltoid muscle]] is most frequently used because the local complication rate is smallest when that site is used. Nonetheless, the buttock is an alternative site of administration because it provides better cosmetic outcomes.\n\nBCG vaccine should be given [[intradermal]]ly. If given [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]]ly, it may induce local infection and spread to the regional [[lymph nodes]], causing either suppurative (production of [[pus]]) and non-suppurative [[lymphadenitis]]. Conservative management is usually adequate for non-suppurative lymphadenitis. If suppuration occurs, it may need [[needle aspiration]]. For non-resolving suppuration, [[surgical excision]] may be required.

Sometimes the powder is sealed with vacuum in a glass ampoule. Such a glass ampoule has to be opened slowly to prevent the airflow from blowing out the powder. Then the powder has to be diluted with saline water before injecting.\n\n==History==\n[[File:BCG advert.jpg|thumb|French poster promoting the BCG vaccine]]\nThe history of BCG is tied to that of [[smallpox]].  [[Jean Antoine Villemin]] first recognized bovine tuberculosis in 1854 and transmitted it, and [[Robert Koch]] first distinguished ''Mycobacterium bovis'' from ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]''.  Following the success of [[vaccination]] in preventing smallpox, established during the 18th century, scientists thought to find a corollary in tuberculosis by drawing a parallel between bovine tuberculosis and [[cowpox]]:  it was hypothesized that infection with bovine tuberculosis might protect against infection with human tuberculosis.  In the late 19th century, clinical trials using ''M. bovis'' were conducted in Italy with disastrous results, because ''M. bovis'' was found to be just as virulent as ''M. tuberculosis''.\n\n[[Albert Calmette]], a French physician and bacteriologist, and his assistant and later colleague, [[Camille Gu\u00e9rin]], a veterinarian, were working at the [[Institut Pasteur de Lille]] ([[Lille]], France) in 1908.  Their work included subculturing virulent strains of the tuberculosis bacillus and testing different culture media. They noted a glycerin-bile-potato mixture grew bacilli that seemed less virulent, and changed the course of their research to see if repeated subculturing would produce a strain that was attenuated enough to be considered for use as a vaccine. The BCG strain was isolated after subculturing 239 times during 13 years from virulent strain on glycerine potato medium.  The research continued throughout World War I until 1919, when the now avirulent bacilli were unable to cause tuberculosis disease in research animals.  Calmette and Guerin transferred to the Paris [[Pasteur Institute]] in 1919.  The BCG vaccine was first used in humans in 1921.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Fine PE, Carneiro IA, Milstein JB, Clements CJ | title=Issues relating to the use of BCG in immunization programs | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) | year=1999 | location=Geneva }}</ref>\n\nPublic acceptance was slow, and one disaster, in particular, did much to harm public acceptance of the vaccine. In the summer of 1930 in [[L\u00fcbeck]], 240 infants were vaccinated in the first 10 days of life; almost all developed tuberculosis and 72 infants died. It was subsequently discovered that the BCG administered there had been contaminated with a virulent strain that was being stored in the same incubator, which led to legal action against the manufacturers of the vaccine.<ref>{{cite book | author=Rosenthal SR. | title=BCG vaccination against tuberculosis | publisher=Little, Brown & Co. | location=Boston | year=1957 }}</ref>\n\nDr. [[R.G. Ferguson]], working at the [[Fort San, Saskatchewan|Fort Qu'Appelle Sanatorium]] in Saskatchewan, was among the pioneers in developing the practice of vaccination against tuberculosis. In 1928, BCG was adopted by the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] (predecessor to the [[World Health Organization]] [WHO]).  Because of opposition, however, it only became widely used after World War II.  From 1945 to 1948, relief organizations (International Tuberculosis Campaign or Joint Enterprises) vaccinated over 8 million babies in [[eastern Europe]] and prevented the predicted typical increase of TB after a major war.\n\nBCG is very efficacious against [[tuberculous meningitis]] in the pediatric age group, but its efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis appears to be variable. As of 2006, only a few countries do not use BCG for routine vaccination. Two countries that have never used it routinely are the United States and the Netherlands (in both countries, it is felt that having a reliable [[Mantoux test]] and therefore being able to accurately detect active disease is more beneficial to society than vaccinating against a condition that is now relatively rare there).<ref>{{cite web

Because of violent behavior on the part of his father, Patrick was taken in at the age of 3 by foster parents, who adopted him later. At the age of 23 he learned about his biological parents, contacted his mother, and met her and his then 16-year-old sister Susan for the first time. The now-adult Patrick moved in with his birth family shortly thereafter. After their mother died suddenly six months later, the siblings became intimately close, and had their first child together in 2001. By 2004, they had four children together: Eric, Sarah, Nancy, and Sofia. The public nature of their relationship, and the repeated [[prosecution]]s and even jail time they have served as a result, has caused some in Germany to question whether incest between consenting adults should be punished at all. An article about them in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' states that the couple are happy together.

For example, the question of the legality and morality of a widower who wished to marry his [[Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act 1907|deceased wife's sister]] was the subject of long and fierce debate in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 19th century, involving, among others, [[Matthew Boulton]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Pollak |first=Ellen |title=Incest and the English Novel, 1684\u20131814 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore MD |year=2003 |page=38 |isbn=978-0-8018-7204-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Tann |first=Jennifer |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |date=May 2007 |chapter=Boulton, Matthew (1728\u20131809)|title-link=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography }}</ref> and [[Charles La Trobe]]. The marriages were entered into in Scotland and Switzerland respectively, where they were legal. In medieval Europe, standing as a [[godparent]] to a child also created a bond of affinity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} But in other societies, a deceased spouse's sibling was considered the ideal person to marry. The Hebrew Bible forbids a man from marrying his brother's widow with the exception that, if his brother died childless, the man is instead required to marry his brother's widow so as to \"raise up seed to him\" (per {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|25:5\u20136|HE}}).  Some societies have long practiced [[sororal polygyny]], a form of [[polygamy]] in which a man marries multiple wives who are sisters to each other (though not closely related to him).\n\nIn Islamic law, marriage among close blood relations like parents, stepparent, parents in-law, siblings, stepsiblings, the children of siblings, aunts and uncles is prohibited, while first or second cousins may marry. Marrying the widow of a brother, or the sister of deceased or divorced wife is also allowed.\n\n==Inbreeding==\n{{Main|Inbreeding}}\nOffspring of biologically related parents are subject to the possible impact of inbreeding. Such offspring have a higher possibility of [[Congenital disorder|congenital birth defects]] (see [[Coefficient of relationship]]) because it increases the proportion of zygotes that are [[homozygous]] for deleterious [[recessive allele]]s that produce such disorders<ref>{{cite journal |last=Livingstone |first=F.

Because most such [[allele]]s are rare in populations, it is unlikely that two unrelated marriage partners will both be heterozygous carriers. However, because close relatives [[Coefficient of relationship|share a large fraction of their alleles]], the probability that any such rare deleterious allele present in the common ancestor will be inherited from both related parents is increased dramatically with respect to non-inbred couples. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes. This has two contrary effects.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thornhill |first=Nancy Wilmsen |title=The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-79854-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZFXYeHxwD10C&printsec=frontcover}}</ref>\n* In the short term, because incestuous reproduction increases [[zygosity]], deleterious recessive alleles will express themselves more frequently, leading to increases in spontaneous abortions of zygotes, perinatal deaths, and postnatal offspring with birth defects.\n* In the long run, however, because of this increased exposure of deleterious recessive alleles to [[natural selection]], their frequency decreases more rapidly in inbred population, leading to a \"healthier\" population (with fewer deleterious recessive alleles).\nThe closer two persons are related, the higher the zygosity, and thus the more severe the biological costs of inbreeding.

Prohibition of incest laws may extend to restrictions on marriage rights, which also vary between jurisdictions. Most jurisdictions prohibit parent-child and sibling marriages, while others also prohibit first-cousin and uncle-niece and aunt-nephew marriages. In most places, incest is illegal, regardless of the ages of the two partners. In other countries, incestuous relationships between consenting adults (with the age varying by location) are permitted, including in the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Spain]].

So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave each one to its own inheritance.' Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons.

Incest corrupts family relationships and marks a regression toward animality.\n\n'''2389'''  Connected to incest is any sexual abuse perpetrated by adults on children or adolescents entrusted to their care.

Therefore, for example, an Egyptian could marry an aunt, but a Roman could not. Despite the act of incest being unacceptable within the Roman Empire, Roman Emperor [[Caligula]] is rumored to have had sexual relationships with all three of his sisters ([[Julia Livilla]], [[Drusilla (sister of Caligula)|Drusilla]], and [[Agrippina the Younger]]).<ref>[[#Potter2007|Potter]], 2007, p. 62.</ref> Emperor [[Claudius]], after executing his previous wife, married his brother's daughter Agrippina the Younger, and changed the law to allow an otherwise illegal union.<ref>Potter, 2007, p. 66.</ref> The law prohibiting marrying a sister's daughter remained.<ref>{{cite book |first=Judith Evans |last=Grubbs |title=Women and the Law in the Roman Empire: a Sourcebook on Marriage, Divorce and Widowhood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X8HXDwMHawC&pg=PA137 |accessdate=7 November 2011 |year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-15240-2 |pages=137\u2013}}</ref> The taboo against incest in Ancient Rome is demonstrated by the fact that politicians would use charges of incest (often false charges) as insults and means of political disenfranchisement.\n\nIn [[Norse mythology]], there are themes of brother-sister marriage, a prominent example being between [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]] and his [[Sister-wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r|unnamed sister]] (perhaps [[Nerthus]]), parents of [[Freyja]] and [[Freyr]].

Because of violent behavior on the part of his father, Patrick was taken in at the age of 3 by foster parents, who adopted him later. At the age of 23 he learned about his biological parents, contacted his mother, and met her and his then 16-year-old sister Susan for the first time. The now-adult Patrick moved in with his birth family shortly thereafter. After their mother died suddenly six months later, the siblings became intimately close, and had their first child together in 2001. By 2004, they had four children together: Eric, Sarah, Nancy, and Sofia. The public nature of their relationship, and the repeated [[prosecution]]s and even jail time they have served as a result, has caused some in Germany to question whether incest between consenting adults should be punished at all. An article about them in ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' states that the couple are happy together.

Such offspring have a higher possibility of [[Congenital disorder|congenital birth defects]] (see [[Coefficient of relationship]]) because it increases the proportion of zygotes that are [[homozygous]] for deleterious [[recessive allele]]s that produce such disorders<ref>{{cite journal |last=Livingstone |first=F. B. |year=1969 |title=Genetics, Ecology, and the Origins of Incest and Exogamy |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=10 |pages=45\u201362 |doi=10.1086/201009}}</ref> (see [[Inbreeding depression]]). Because most such [[allele]]s are rare in populations, it is unlikely that two unrelated marriage partners will both be heterozygous carriers. However, because close relatives [[Coefficient of relationship|share a large fraction of their alleles]], the probability that any such rare deleterious allele present in the common ancestor will be inherited from both related parents is increased dramatically with respect to non-inbred couples. Contrary to common belief, inbreeding does not in itself alter allele frequencies, but rather increases the relative proportion of homozygotes to heterozygotes. This has two contrary effects.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thornhill |first=Nancy Wilmsen |title=The Natural History of Inbreeding and Outbreeding: Theoretical and Empirical Perspectives |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |location=Chicago |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-79854-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZFXYeHxwD10C&printsec=frontcover}}</ref>\n* In the short term, because incestuous reproduction increases [[zygosity]], deleterious recessive alleles will express themselves more frequently, leading to increases in spontaneous abortions of zygotes, perinatal deaths, and postnatal offspring with birth defects.\n* In the long run, however, because of this increased exposure of deleterious recessive alleles to [[natural selection]], their frequency decreases more rapidly in inbred population, leading to a \"healthier\" population (with fewer deleterious recessive alleles).\nThe closer two persons are related, the higher the zygosity, and thus the more severe the biological costs of inbreeding. This fact likely explains why inbreeding between close relatives, such as siblings, is less common than inbreeding between cousins.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Antfolk |first1=Jan |last2=Lieberman |first2=Debra |last3=Santtila |first3=Pekka |title=Fitness Costs Predict Inbreeding Aversion Irrespective of Self-Involvement: Support for Hypotheses Derived from Evolutionary Theory |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=7 |issue=11 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050613 |pages=e50613 |pmid=23209792 |pmc=3509093|year=2012 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...750613A }}</ref>\n\nThere may also be other deleterious effects besides those caused by recessive diseases.

Prohibition of incest laws may extend to restrictions on marriage rights, which also vary between jurisdictions. Most jurisdictions prohibit parent-child and sibling marriages, while others also prohibit first-cousin and uncle-niece and aunt-nephew marriages. In most places, incest is illegal, regardless of the ages of the two partners. In other countries, incestuous relationships between consenting adults (with the age varying by location) are permitted, including in the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Spain]]. [[Sweden]] is the only country that allows marriage between half-siblings and they must seek government counseling before marriage.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6424337.stm Incest: an age-old taboo].

This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded concerning the daughters of [[Zelophehad]], saying: Let them be married to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married. So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave every one to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may possess every man the inheritance of his fathers. So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave each one to its own inheritance.' Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons.

St. Paul stigmatizes this especially grave offense: 'It is actually reported that there is immorality among you...for a man is living with his father's wife....In the name of the Lord Jesus...you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh....' Incest corrupts family relationships and marks a regression toward animality.\n\n'''2389'''  Connected to incest is any sexual abuse perpetrated by adults on children or adolescents entrusted to their care. The offense is compounded by the scandalous harm done to the physical and moral integrity of the young, who will remain scarred by it all their lives; and the violation of responsibility for their upbringing.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church 2388\u20132389]</ref></blockquote> \n\nThe [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Anglican Communion]] allows marriages up to and including first cousins.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/|year=1962|place=Canada|title=Book of Common Prayer|chapter=A Table of Kindred and Affinity|chapterurl=http://prayerbook.ca/resources/bcponline/kindred-and-affinity/}}</ref>\n\n===Islamic===\n\n{{main|Mahram}}\nThe [[Quran]] gives specific rules regarding incest, which prohibit a man from marrying or having sexual relationships with:\n\n* his father's wife<ref name=\"Quran22\">{{cite web | url = http://quran.com/4/22 | title = S\u00fbrah an Nisa 4:22}}</ref> (his mother,<ref name=\"Quran23\">{{cite web | url = http://quran.com/4/23 | title = S\u00fbrah an Nisa 4:23}}</ref> or stepmother<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web | url = http://quran.al-islam.com/Targama/DispTargam.asp?nType=1&nSeg=0&l=eng&nSora=4&nAya=22&t=eng | title = Surah an-Nisa 4:23}}</ref>), his mother-in-law, a woman from whom he has nursed, even the children of this woman<ref name=\"Quran23\" />\n* either parent's sister (aunt),<ref name=\"Quran23\"/>\n* his sister, his half sister, a woman who has nursed from the same woman as he, his sister-in-law (wife's sister) while still married.
