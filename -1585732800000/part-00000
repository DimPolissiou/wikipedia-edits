Tottenham Hotspur shrugged off a disappointing Champions League campaign to push Chelsea close for the title, though they ultimately missed out. However, they finished the season with statistically both the best attack and defence, with striker [[Harry Kane]] once again claiming the Golden Boot. Furthermore, the season marked the end of Tottenham's 118 year stay at the White Hart Lane stadium, temporarily using Wembley for the subsequent season, before a new stadium move<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sport.bt.com/football/premier-league-facts-2016-17-S11364181838117|title=Premier League facts 2016-17|last=|first=|date=21/05/2017|website=BT Sport|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=01/04/2020}}</ref>. Manchester City finished one spot better than the previous season in [[Pep Guardiola]]'s first season in charge, though ended the season trophy-less, despite recording the third-best attack and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Liverpool made the Champions League for the first time in three years in [[J\u00fcrgen Klopp]]'s first full season, though they were prevented from finishing any higher than fourth by an inconsistent start to 2017, a consequence of both losing their \u00a335&nbsp;million signing [[Sadio Man\u00e9]] to international duty in January and February as well as suffering from several dropped points against bottom-half teams.\n\nDespite winning seven of their final eight games, Arsenal finished fifth and failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1997, as fan pressure on both manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] and majority-shareholder [[Stan Kroenke]] grew. While they did win the FA Cup for the third time in four seasons, making Wenger the most successful manager in the competition's history, they endured yet another disappointing Champions League run, eliminated at the round of 16 for a seventh successive year. Manchester United finished sixth, one lower than the previous season, in [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]]'s first season in charge, with their failure to turn any one of their 15 draws \u2013 with 12 earned amidst the season-record 25 matches unbeaten run \u2013 into victories proving problematic. They did at least win the EFL Cup and won the [[2017 UEFA Europa League Final|Europa League final]]. The latter was the first Europa League title in their history, not only securing a place in the Champions League but also made them only the fifth club to [[UEFA club competition records and statistics#List of teams to have won the three main European club competitions|have won all three major European trophies]].\n\nIn only their second-ever top-flight season, AFC Bournemouth built on the success of the previous season as they secured a ninth-place finish and scored 55 goals, defying the critics who had tipped them to struggle from second-season syndrome. Much as Chelsea had the previous season, Leicester City made a poor defence of their title, despite having what turned out to be the best Champions League run of any English club this season. They were beaten by Hull City in the first match, the first time this has happened to a reigning Premier League champion. With the club struggling, manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] was sacked in February and replaced by coach [[Craig Shakespeare]], who steered the club to 12th. It broke the record of the lowest finish for Premier League title holders, previously set by Chelsea, but comfortably clear of relegation.\n\nSwansea City had looked dead and buried after early struggles under [[Francesco Guidolin]] and then a disastrous spell with [[Bob Bradley]] as manager, but were saved by a late improvement under [[Paul Clement (football manager)|Paul Clement]]'s management. Burnley fared the best of the promoted clubs, with only atrocious away form preventing them finishing higher as they made their home-ground of Turf Moor one of the hardest places to get a point from \u2013 and secured a second successive top-flight season for the first time in 40 years. Watford, in their first successive top-flight campaign for 30 years, successfully ensured a third consecutive Premier League season \u2013 however, as a result of poor away form, a disastrous end to the season and several spells of indifferent form throughout the campaign, the Hornets were unable to really build on the previous season despite recording their first league victories over Manchester United and at Arsenal since the 1980s.\n\nAfter several successive escapes from relegation, Sunderland's resilience finally broke and they dropped into the Championship after a decade, having spent virtually the entire season rooted to the bottom of the table. Middlesbrough also struggled through their first top-flight season in eight years, with a poor end to the season, the weakest goal-scoring record in the division and an inability to turn one of their 13 draws into victories dooming them. Hull City were the final relegated side, never quite recovering from a disastrous pre-season which saw manager [[Steve Bruce]] quit and next to no new players signed. Despite encouraging early season form under [[Mike Phelan]], a dismal run in the winter saw him sacked and replaced by [[Marco Silva]], who steered the club to a much better second half of the season, but it ultimately proved to be a case of too little, too late.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2015\u201316 Football League Championship|Championship]]. The promoted teams were [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. Burnley and Hull City returned to the top flight after a season's absence while Middlesbrough returned after a seven-year absence. They replaced [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], ending their top flight spells of six, one and twenty-eight years respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 2016\u201317 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.5155|long= -0.0922|label_size=80|label=London|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.735232 |long=-1.838287 |label_size=80|label=[[A.F.C.

Tottenham Hotspur shrugged off a disappointing Champions League campaign to push Chelsea close for the title, though they ultimately missed out. However, they finished the season with statistically both the best attack and defence, with striker [[Harry Kane]] once again claiming the Golden Boot. Manchester City finished one spot better than the previous season in [[Pep Guardiola]]'s first season in charge, though ended the season trophy-less, despite recording the third-best attack and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Liverpool made the Champions League for the first time in three years in [[J\u00fcrgen Klopp]]'s first full season, though they were prevented from finishing any higher than fourth by an inconsistent start to 2017, a consequence of both losing their \u00a335&nbsp;million signing [[Sadio Man\u00e9]] to international duty in January and February as well as suffering from several dropped points against bottom-half teams.\n\nDespite winning seven of their final eight games, Arsenal finished fifth and failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1997, as fan pressure on both manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] and majority-shareholder [[Stan Kroenke]] grew. While they did win the FA Cup for the third time in four seasons, making Wenger the most successful manager in the competition's history, they endured yet another disappointing Champions League run, eliminated at the round of 16 for a seventh successive year. Manchester United finished sixth, one lower than the previous season, in [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]]'s first season in charge, with their failure to turn any one of their 15 draws \u2013 with 12 earned amidst the season-record 25 matches unbeaten run \u2013 into victories proving problematic. They did at least win the EFL Cup and won the [[2017 UEFA Europa League Final|Europa League final]]. The latter was the first Europa League title in their history, not only securing a place in the Champions League but also made them only the fifth club to [[UEFA club competition records and statistics#List of teams to have won the three main European club competitions|have won all three major European trophies]].\n\nIn only their second-ever top-flight season, AFC Bournemouth built on the success of the previous season as they secured a ninth-place finish and scored 55 goals, defying the critics who had tipped them to struggle from second-season syndrome. Much as Chelsea had the previous season, Leicester City made a poor defence of their title, despite having what turned out to be the best Champions League run of any English club this season. They were beaten by Hull City in the first match, the first time this has happened to a reigning Premier League champion. With the club struggling, manager [[Claudio Ranieri]] was sacked in February and replaced by coach [[Craig Shakespeare]], who steered the club to 12th. It broke the record of the lowest finish for Premier League title holders, previously set by Chelsea, but comfortably clear of relegation.\n\nSwansea City had looked dead and buried after early struggles under [[Francesco Guidolin]] and then a disastrous spell with [[Bob Bradley]] as manager, but were saved by a late improvement under [[Paul Clement (football manager)|Paul Clement]]'s management. Burnley fared the best of the promoted clubs, with only atrocious away form preventing them finishing higher as they made their home-ground of Turf Moor one of the hardest places to get a point from \u2013 and secured a second successive top-flight season for the first time in 40 years. Watford, in their first successive top-flight campaign for 30 years, successfully ensured a third consecutive Premier League season \u2013 however, as a result of poor away form, a disastrous end to the season and several spells of indifferent form throughout the campaign, the Hornets were unable to really build on the previous season despite recording their first league victories over Manchester United and at Arsenal since the 1980s.\n\nAfter several successive escapes from relegation, Sunderland's resilience finally broke and they dropped into the Championship after a decade, having spent virtually the entire season rooted to the bottom of the table. Middlesbrough also struggled through their first top-flight season in eight years, with a poor end to the season, the weakest goal-scoring record in the division and an inability to turn one of their 13 draws into victories dooming them. Hull City were the final relegated side, never quite recovering from a disastrous pre-season which saw manager [[Steve Bruce]] quit and next to no new players signed. Despite encouraging early season form under [[Mike Phelan]], a dismal run in the winter saw him sacked and replaced by [[Marco Silva]], who steered the club to a much better second half of the season, but it ultimately proved to be a case of too little, too late.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2015\u201316 Football League Championship|Championship]]. The promoted teams were [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. Burnley and Hull City returned to the top flight after a season's absence while Middlesbrough returned after a seven-year absence. They replaced [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], ending their top flight spells of six, one and twenty-eight years respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 2016\u201317 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.5155|long= -0.0922|label_size=80|label=London|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.735232 |long=-1.838287 |label_size=80|label=[[A.F.C.

when Siya was born and his father, Fezakele, was in his final year of school. Kolisi's mother died when he was 15, leaving his late grandmother, Nolulamile, to raise him.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/06/siya-kolisi-interview-south-africa-first-black-test-captain-england |title=Siya Kolisi: \u2018We represent something much bigger than we can imagine\u2019 |last=Ray|first=Craig |date=6 June 2018 |website=The Guardian |url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Kolisi grew up in the impoverished [[Ibhayi|Zwide]] township outside [[Port Elizabeth]] and endured a tough upbringing. At the age of 12, he impressed scouts at a youth tournament in [[Mossel Bay]] and was offered a scholarship at Grey Junior in Port Elizabeth. He  was subsequently offered a rugby scholarship to the prestigious [[Grey High School]], which South African cricketer [[Graeme Pollock]] and England International [[Mike Catt]] had attended. Kolisi was a regular  member of the first XV rugby team. He was also a part of the {{Rut Eastern Province Kings}} youth set-up between 2007 and 2009, playing in the Under-16 Grant Khomo week and the Under-18 [[Craven Week]] before shifting west to join Western Province.<ref name=\"Kolisi\u2019s living the dream\">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugbymag.co.za/blog/details/kolisis-living-the-dream | title=Kolisi's living the dream | work=[[SA Rugby Mag]] | date = 13 June 2013 | accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"reunion\">{{cite web | url=http://www.supersport.com/rugby/springboks/news/130612/Kolisi_a_Green_Gold_father_son_reunion | title=Kolisi \u2013 a Green & Gold, father & son reunion | publisher=[[SuperSport (South African TV channel)|Supersport]] | date = 12 June 2013 | accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>  He further represented the [[South Africa national under-18 rugby union team]] (SA Schools team) for two consecutive years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sablenetwork.com/resources/siya-kolisi-true-story.pdf|title=Siya Kolisi True Story|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nKolisi made his senior debut for Western Province against the {{Rut Golden Lions}} during the [[2011 Vodacom Cup]] and later in the year several injuries and international call-ups gave him the opportunity to make regular starts in the [[2011 Currie Cup Premier Division|Currie Cup]].  He made 13 appearances and scored 4 tries during the campaign including a crucial score against bitter rivals the{{Rut Blue Bulls}}.<ref name=\"Siya Kolisi WP Rugby Player Profile\"/><ref name=\"Siya Kolisi itsrugby.co.uk Player Statistics\"/>\n\n2012 saw Kolisi graduate to the Stormers squad and he made an immediate impact with 16 appearances during the [[2012 Super Rugby season|season]] and 1 try.   The second half of the year was not so kind to him as a thumb injury restricted him to just one appearance in the [[2012 Currie Cup Premier Division|2012 Currie Cup]] and he had to watch on from the sidelines as Province lifted their 33rd Currie Cup title.<ref name=\"WP's Kolisi out for the season\">{{cite web | url=http://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/CurrieCup/WPs-Siya-Kolisi-out-for-the-season-20120826 | title=WP's Kolisi out for the season | work=Sport 24 | date = 26 August 2012 | accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nKolisi returned with a bang the following year and held his place in the Stormers side despite fierce competition among the loose forwards.   13 appearances and 2 tries were recorded and this earned him his first international recognition.

{"title_page": "Snorkeling", "text_new": "{{short description|Swimming while breathing through a snorkel}}\n[[File:Reef snorkeler.jpg|thumb|A snorkeler amid [[coral]]s on a [[coral reef]] near [[Fiji]]]]\n\n'''Snorkeling''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Doubled in British English|British and Commonwealth English spelling]]: '''snorkelling''') is the practice of [[human swimming|swimming]] on or through a body of water while equipped with a [[diving mask]], a shaped breathing tube called a snorkel, and usually [[swimfins]]. In cooler waters, a [[wetsuit]] may also be worn. Use of this equipment allows the snorkeler to observe underwater attractions for extended periods  with relatively little effort and to breathe while face-down at the surface.\n\nSnorkeling is a popular [[recreation]]al activity, particularly at [[tropics|tropical]] [[resort]] locations. The primary appeal is the opportunity to observe [[marine biology#Lifeforms|underwater life]] in a natural setting without the complicated equipment and training required for [[scuba diving]]. It appeals to all ages because of how little effort there is, and without the exhaled bubbles of scuba-diving equipment. It is the basis of the two surface disciplines of the  [[underwater sports|underwater sport]] of [[finswimming]].<ref name=finswimmimg />\n\nSnorkeling is also used by scuba divers when on the surface, in underwater sports such as [[underwater hockey]] and [[underwater rugby]], and as part of water-based searches conducted by [[search and rescue]] teams.\n==Equipment==\nEssential equipment includes the [[Snorkel (swimming)|snorkel]] for breathing, and a [[diving mask]] or [[swimming goggles]] for vision. [[Swimfin]]s for more efficient propulsion are common. Environmental protection against cold, sunburn and marine stings and scratches is also regionally popular, and may be in the form of a [[wetsuit]], [[diving skins]], or [[rash vest]]. Some snorkellers rely on waterproof [[sunscreen]] lotions, but some of these are environmentally damaging. If necessary the snorkeller may wear a [[weightbelt]] to facilitate [[freediving]], or an inflatable snorkelling vest, a form of [[buoyancy aid]], for safety.\n\n=== Snorkel ===\n{{main|Snorkel (swimming)}}\n[[File:Vieques underwater a.jpg|thumb|Adult's snorkel]]\n[[File:Tuba enfant.jpg|thumb|Child's snorkel]]\nA snorkel is a device used for breathing air from above the surface when the wearer's head is face downwards in the water with the mouth and the nose submerged. It may be either separate or integrated into a swimming or diving [[diving mask|mask]]. The integrated version is only suitable for surface snorkeling, while the separate device may also be used for [[underwater sports|underwater activities]] such as [[spearfishing]], [[freediving]], [[finswimming]], [[underwater hockey]], [[underwater rugby]] and for surface breathing with [[scuba equipment]]. A swimmer's snorkel is a tube bent into a shape often resembling the letter \"L\" or \"J\", fitted with a [[mouthpiece (scuba)|mouthpiece]] at the lower end and constructed of light metal, [[rubber]] or [[plastic]]. The snorkel may come with a [[rubber]] loop or a plastic clip enabling the snorkel to be attached to the outside of the head strap of the [[diving mask]]. Although the snorkel may also be secured by tucking the tube between the mask-strap and the head, this alternative strategy can lead to physical discomfort, mask leakage or even snorkel loss.<ref>Steve Blount and Herb Taylor, ''The Joy of Snorkeling'', New York, NY: Pisces Book Company, 1984, p. 21.</ref>\n\nSnorkels constitute respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]]. When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in [[hypercapnia]]. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the [[tidal volume]] of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. A smaller diameter tube reduces the dead volume, but also increases resistance to airflow and so increases the work of breathing. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly expands the dead space. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply and slowly, as this reduces the dead space ratio and [[work of breathing]].\n\n[[File:Snorkel shapes.jpg|thumb|Basic snorkel shapes]]\nSnorkels come in two orientations: Front-mounted and side-mounted. The first snorkel to be patented in 1938 was front-mounted, worn with the tube over the front of the face and secured with a bracket to the diving mask. Front-mounted snorkels proved popular in European snorkeling until the late 1950s, when side-mounted snorkels came into the ascendancy. Front-mounted snorkels experienced a comeback a decade later as a piece of competitive swimming equipment to be used in pool workouts and in finswimming races, where they outperform side-mounted snorkels in streamlining.\n\n==== Plain snorkel ====\nA plain snorkel consists essentially of a tube with a mouthpiece to be inserted between the lips.\n[[File:Snorkel attachment methods.jpg|thumb|Snorkel attachment methods]]\n[[File:Snorkel mouthpieces.jpg|thumb|Snorkel mouthpieces]]\nThe barrel is the hollow tube leading from the supply end at the top of the snorkel to the mouthpiece at the bottom. The barrel is made of a relatively rigid material such as plastic, light metal or hard rubber. The bore is the interior chamber of the barrel; bore length, diameter and bends all affect breathing resistance.\n\nThe top of the barrel may be open to the elements or fitted with a valve designed to shut off the air supply from the atmosphere when the top is submerged. There may be a high visibility band around the top to alert other water users of the snorkeller's presence. The simplest way of attaching the snorkel to the head is to slip the top of the barrel between the mask strap and the head. This may cause the mask to leak, however, and alternative means of attachment of the barrel to the head include threading the mask strap a moulded on the barrel, using a figure-8 rubber snorkel keeper pulled down over the barrel, or a rotatable plastic snorkel keeper clipped to the barrel\n\nThe mouthpiece helps to keep the snorkel in the mouth. It is made of soft and flexible material, originally natural rubber and more recently silicone or [[PVC]]. The commonest of the multiple designs available<ref>P. P. Serebrenitsky: ''\u0422\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430'', Lenizdat, 1969, p. 92.

A tight grip with the teeth can also cause jaw fatigue and pain.\n\n====Full-face snorkel mask====\n[[File:Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask.jpg|thumb|Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask]]\nAn integrated snorkel consists essentially of a tube topped with a shut-off valve and opening at the bottom into the interior of a diving mask. Integrated snorkels must be fitted with valves to shut off the snorkel's air inlet when submerged. Water will otherwise pour into the opening at the top and flood the interior of the mask. Snorkels are attached to sockets on the top or the sides of the mask.\n\nNew-generation snorkel-masks are full-face masks covering the eyes, the nose and the mouth. They enable surface snorkellers to breathe nasally or orally and may be a workaround in the case of surface snorkellers who [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag]] in response to the presence of standard snorkel mouthpieces in their mouths. Some early snorkel-masks are full-face masks covering the eyes, nose and mouth, while others exclude the mouth, covering the eyes and the nose only. The 1950s [[US Divers]] \"Marino\" hybrid comprised a single snorkel mask with eye and nose coverage and a separate snorkel for the mouth.<ref>''Early Mfg. & Retailers - US Divers No.43''. Retrieved on 26 February 2019 at http://www.skindivinghistory.com/mfg_retailers/u/US_Divers/43.html.</ref>\n\nFull face snorkel masks use an integral snorkel with separate channels for intake and exhaled gases theoretically ensuring the user is always breathing untainted fresh air whatever the respiratory effort. Built-in dry top snorkel system. In addition to a standard ball float system that stops the water from entering the tube when submerged, full-face masks are designed in such a way that even if a small amount of water does get into the snorkel, it will be channeled away from the face and into the chin area of the mask. A special valve located on the bottom of the chin allows to drain the water out. The main problem is that it must fit the whole face well enough to make a reliable seal and since no two faces are the same shape, it may not seal adequately on any specific user. In the event of accidental flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing.{{Clarify|reason=can these masks  not be cleared in place?|date=September 2019}} Unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on the surface, or a couple of feet below, since the mask covers the nose with a rigid plastic structure, which makes it impossible to pinch the nose if needed to equalise pressure at greater depth. Trained scuba divers are likely to avoid such devices<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dipndive.com/blog/full-face-snorkeling-masks-pros-and-cons.html|title=Full-Face Snorkeling Masks: Pros And Cons|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}</ref> however snorkel masks are a boon for those with medical conditions that preclude taking part in scuba diving.{{cn|date=February 2019}}{{clarify|reason=how, specifically, are snorkel masks a \"boon\" for these people?|date=February 2019}}\n\nAs a result of a short period with an unusually high number of snorkeling deaths in Hawaii<ref>https://www.letsgotomaui.net/da-kine/full-face-snorkel-mask-dangers/</ref> there is some suspicion that the design of the masks can result in buildup of excess CO<sub>2</sub>. It is far from certain that the masks are at fault, but the state of Hawaii has begun to track the equipment being used in cases of snorkeling fatalities. Besides the possibility that the masks, or at least some brands of the mask, are a cause, other theories include the possibility that the masks make snorkeling accessible to people who have difficulty with traditional snorkeling equipment. That ease of access may result in more snorkelers who lack experience or have underlying medical conditions, possibly exacerbating problems that are unrelated to the type of equipment being used.<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-full-face-snorkel-mask-related-deaths/</ref>\n\nDuring the current [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic related shortages]], full-face snorkel masks have been adapted to create oxygen dispensing emergency respiratory masks by deploying [[3D printing]] and carrying out minimal modifications to the original mask.<ref>[http://www.leparisien.fr/societe/coronavirus-quand-les-inventeurs-viennent-a-la-rescousse-des-hopitaux-23-03-2020-8286186.php Opoczynski, David (23 March 2020). \"Coronavirus : quand les inventeurs viennent \u00e0 la rescousse des h\u00f4pitaux\". leparisien.fr].

By creating an airspace, the mask enables the snorkeler to see clearly underwater. All scuba diving masks consist of the lenses also known as a faceplate, a soft rubber skirt, which encloses the nose and seals against the face, and a head strap to hold it in place. There are different styles and shapes. These range from oval shaped models to lower internal volume masks and may be made from different materials; common choices are silicone and rubber. A snorkeler who remains at the surface can use swimmer's goggles which do not enclose the nose.\n\n===Swimfins===\n{{Main|Swimfin}}\nSwimfins, fins or flippers are [[fin]]like accessories worn on the feet,<ref name=\"AlainPerrier\" />  and usually made from [[rubber]] or [[plastic]], to aid movement through the water in [[Water sport (recreation)|water sports]] activities. Swimfins help the wearer to move through [[water]] more efficiently, as [[Foot|human feet]] are too small and inappropriately shaped to provide much [[thrust]], especially when the wearer is carrying equipment that increases [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamic]] [[Drag (physics)|drag]].<ref name=\"pendergast2003\">{{cite journal |last1=Pendergast |first1=DR |last2=Mollendorf |first2=J |last3=Logue |first3=C |last4=Samimy |first4=S |title=Evaluation of fins used in underwater swimming |journal=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=57\u201373 |year=2003 |publisher=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society |pmid=12841609 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3936 |accessdate=11 February 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid15796314\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pendergast D, Mollendorf J, Zamparo P, Termin A, Bushnell D, Paschke D |title=The influence of drag on human locomotion in water |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=45\u201357 |year=2005 |pmid=15796314 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4037 |accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid9148086\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pendergast DR, Tedesco M, Nawrocki DM, Fisher NM |title=Energetics of underwater swimming with SCUBA |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=573\u201380 |date=May 1996 |pmid=9148086 |doi= 10.1097/00005768-199605000-00006}}</ref> Very long fins and [[monofin]]s used by freedivers as a means of underwater propulsion do not require high-[[frequency]] leg movement. This improves efficiency and helps to minimize oxygen consumption. Short, stiff-bladed fins are effective for short bursts of acceleration and maneuvering.\n\n===Exposure protection===\n{{see also|Wetsuit|Dive skins|Rash guard}}\nA [[wetsuit]] is a garment, usually made of foamed neoprene with a knit fabric facing, which is worn by people engaged in water sports and other activities in or on water, primarily providing thermal insulation, but also buoyancy and protection from abrasion, ultraviolet exposure and stings from marine organisms. The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to conduct heat. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water. The thickness, fit and coverage of the suit are important factors for insulation.\n\n[[Diving suit#Dive skins|Dive skins]] are used when diving in water temperatures above {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. They are usually one piece full length garments made from [[spandex|spandex or Lycra]] and provide little thermal protection, but do protect the skin from [[jellyfish]] stings, abrasion and [[sunburn]]. This kind of suit is also known as a 'Stinger Suit'. Some divers wear a dive skin under a wetsuit, which allows easier donning and (for those who experience skin problems from neoprene) provides additional comfort.<ref name=\"EcoStinger 2014\" />\n\nA [[rash guard]], also known as rash vest or rashie, is an athletic shirt made of spandex and nylon or polyester. The name rash guard reflects the fact that the shirt protects the wearer against rashes caused by abrasion, or by sunburn from extended exposure to the sun. These shirts can be worn by themselves, or under a wetsuit. A rash guard by itself is used for light coverage in warm to extreme summer temperatures for several watersports including snorkeling. There are also lower body rash guards, which are similar to compression shorts to be worn under the surfers' boardshorts.\n\n===Weight belt===\n{{See also|Diver weighting system#Weight belt}}\n[[File:Zavorra.JPG|thumb|Typical weight belt ]]\nWeight belts are the most common weighting system currently in use for snorkeling.<ref>[http://ygraine.membrane.com/enterhtml/live/scuba/products.html Scuba diving air Regulators, buoyancy compensators scuba diving equipment, information advice help with scuba gear products safety - Philadelphia Area Dive Shops<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621090205/http://ygraine.membrane.com/enterhtml/live/scuba/products.html |date=June 21, 2007 }}</ref> They are generally made of tough [[nylon]] webbing, but other materials such as [[rubber]] can be used. Weight belts for snorkeling are generally fitted with a quick release buckle to allow the dumping of weight rapidly in an emergency.\n\nThe most common design of weight used with a belt is rectangular [[lead]] blocks with two slots in them threaded onto the belt. These blocks can be coated in [[plastic]], which increases corrosion resistance. The plastic coated weights may be marketed as being less abrasive to [[wetsuits]]. The weights may be constrained from sliding along the webbing by metal or plastic [[Glossary of underwater diving terminology#belt slide|belt sliders]]. Another popular style has a single slot through which the belt can be threaded. These are sometimes locked in position by squeezing the weight to grip the webbing, but this makes them difficult to remove when less weight is needed. There are also weight designs which may be added to the belt by clipping on when needed. The amount of weight needed depends mainly on the buoyancy of the wet suit.\n\n===Snorkeling vest===\nAn inflatable [[Personal flotation device|personal buoyancy aid]] designed for surface swimming applications. In shape, often like a horse-collar [[Buoyancy compensator (diving)|buoyancy compensator]], or [[airline]] [[life jacket]], but only with oral inflation or a CO<sub>2</sub> cartridge for emergencies.\n\n== Operation ==\nThe simplest type of snorkel is a plain tube that is allowed to flood when [[underwater]]. The snorkeler expels water from the snorkel either with a sharp exhalation on return to the surface (''blast clearing'') or by tilting the head back shortly before reaching the surface and exhaling until reaching or breaking the surface (''displacement method'') and facing forward or down again before inhaling the next breath. The displacement method expels water by filling the snorkel with air; it is a technique that takes practice but clears the snorkel with less effort, but only works when surfacing. Clearing splash water while at the surface requires blast clearing.<ref>Underwater World, ''Unit 3- Diving Skills''. Retrieved on 28 February 2019 at https://www.diveunderwaterworld.com/s/Chapter-3-Diving-Skills.pdf.</ref>\n\nExperienced users tend to develop a surface breathing style which minimises work of breathing, carbon dioxide buildup and risk of water inspiration, while optimising water removal. This involves a sharp puff in the early stage of exhalation, which is effective for clearing the tube of remaining water, and a fairly large but comfortable exhaled volume, mostly fairly slowly for low work of breathing, followed by an immediate slow inhalation, which reduces entrainment of any residual water, to a comfortable but relatively large inhaled volume, repeated without delay. Elastic recoil is used to assist with the initial puff, which can be made sharper by controlling the start of exhalation with the tongue. This technique is most applicable to relaxed cruising on the surface. Racing finswimmers may use a different technique as they need a far greater level of ventilation when working hard. \n\nSome snorkels have a [[sump]] at the lowest point to allow a small volume of water to remain in the snorkel without being inhaled when the snorkeler breathes. Some also have a [[non-return valve]] in the sump, to drain water in the tube when the diver exhales. The water is pushed out through the valve when the tube is blocked by water and the exhalation pressure exceeds the water pressure on the outside of the valve. This is almost exactly the mechanism of blast clearing which does not require the valve, but the pressure required is marginally less, and effective blast clearing requires a higher flow rate. The full face mask has a double airflow valve which allows breathing through the nose in addition to the mouth.<ref>Snorkel Ken, \"Full Face Snorkel Mask Reviews | Tribord EasyBreathe Alternatives and Best Prices\". Retrieved on 3 March 2019 at https://snorkelstore.net/full-face-snorkel-mask-review-lower-price-lower-quality/.</ref> A few models of snorkel have float-operated valves attached to the top end of the tube to keep water out when a wave passes, but these cause problems when diving as the snorkel must then be equalized during descent, using part of the diver's inhaled air supply. Some recent designs have a splash deflector on the top end that reduces entry of any water that splashes over the top end of the tube, thereby keeping it relatively free from water.<ref>US patent 5,404,872, ''Splash-guard for snorkel tubes'', April 11, 1995. Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/01/fe/9a/6038e50865f3f1/US5404872.pdf.</ref>\n\nFinswimmers do not normally use snorkels with a sump valve, as they learn to blast clear the tube on most if not all exhalations, which keeps the water content in the tube to a minimum as the tube can be shaped for lower work of breathing, and elimination of water traps, allowing greater speed and lowering the stress of eventual swallowing of small quantities of water, which would impede their competition performance.<ref>''Finswimming snorkels''. Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://monofin.co.uk/blog-snorkels.html</ref>\n\nA common problem with all mechanical clearing mechanisms is their tendency to fail if infrequently used, or if stored for long periods, or through environmental fouling, or owing to lack of maintenance. Many also either slightly increase the flow resistance of the snorkel, or provide a small water trap, which retains a little water in the tube after clearing.<ref>''Snorkel Care''. Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://www.scubadoctor.com.au/care-snorkel.htm.</ref>\n\nModern designs use [[silicone rubber]] in the mouthpiece and one-way clearing and float valves due to its resistance to degradation and its long service life. [[Natural rubber]] was formerly used, but slowly oxidizes and breaks down due to ultraviolet light exposure from the sun. It eventually loses its flexibility, becomes brittle and cracks, which can cause clearing valves to stick in the open or closed position, and float valves to leak due to a failure of the valve seat to seal. In even older designs, some snorkels were made with small \"[[ping pong]]\" balls in a [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]] mounted to the open end of the tube to prevent water ingress. These are no longer sold or recommended because they are unreliable and considered hazardous. Similarly, [[diving mask]]s with a built-in snorkel are considered unsafe by scuba diving organizations such as PADI, BSAC because they can engender a false sense of security and can be difficult to clear if flooded.\n\nA snorkel may be either separate or integrated into a swim or dive [[diving mask|mask]]. Usage of the term \"snorkel\" in this section excludes devices integrated with, and opening into, swimmers' or divers' masks. A separate snorkel typically comprises a tube for breathing and a means of attaching the tube to the head of the wearer. The tube has an opening at the top and a mouthpiece at the bottom. Some tubes are topped with a valve to prevent water from entering the tube when it is [[Underwater|submerged]].\n\nThe total length, inner diameter and/or inner volume of a snorkel tube are matters of utmost importance because they affect the user's ability to breathe normally while swimming or floating head downwards on the surface of the water. These dimensions also have implications for the user's ability to blow residual water out of the tube when surfacing. An overlong snorkel tube may cause breathing resistance, while an overwide tube may prove hard to clear of water. A high-volume tube is liable to encourage a build-up of stale air, including exhaled carbon dioxide, because it constitutes respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]].\n\n==Practice of snorkeling ==\n[[File:Sea Garden of BUNAKEN.jpg|thumb|Snorkeler with mask and snorkel]]\nSnorkeling is an activity in its own right, as well as an adjunct to other activities, such as breath-hold diving, [[spearfishing]] and [[scuba diving]],<ref name=\"NOAA Diving Manual 1979\" /> and several competitive [[underwater sports]], such as [[underwater hockey]] and [[finswimming]]. In all cases, the use of a snorkel facilitates breathing while swimming at the surface and observing what is going on under the water.\n\nBeing non-competitive, snorkeling is considered more a leisure activity than a [[sport]].<ref name=\"Jennings2007\">{{cite book|author=Gayle Jennings|title=Water-Based Tourism, Sport, Leisure, and Recreation Experiences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sBAGX5l5uuwC&pg=PA130|date=2 April 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-34928-7|pages=130\u2013}}</ref> Snorkeling requires no special training, only the very basic swimming abilities and being able to breathe through the snorkel.<ref name=\"Fodor's1988\">{{cite book|author=Fodor's|title=Fodor's 89 Cancun, Cozumel, Merida, the Yucatan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lt5pggSPkwkC|year=1988|publisher=Fodor's Travel Publications|isbn=978-0-679-01610-6}}</ref> Some organizations, such as BSAC, {{by whom|date=August 2015}} recommend that for snorkeling safety one should not snorkel alone,<ref name=safety /> but rather with a \"[[buddy diving|buddy]]\", a [[guide]] or a tour group.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n[[Underwater photography]] has become more and more popular since the early 2000s, resulting in millions of pictures posted every year on various websites and social media. This mass of documentation is endowed with an enormous scientific potential, as millions of tourists possess a much superior coverage power than professional scientists, who can not allow themselves to spend so much time in the field. \nAs a consequence, several participative sciences programs have been developed, supported by geo-localization and identification web sites, along with protocols for auto-organization and self-teaching aimed at biodiversity-interested snorkelers, in order for them to turn their observations into sound scientific data, available for research. This kind of approach has been successfully used in [[R\u00e9union island]], allowing for tens of new records and even new species.<ref name=\"CBM2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Bourjon |first1=Philippe |last2=Ducarme |first2=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric |last3=Quod |first3=Jean-Pascal |last4=Sweet |first4=Michael |year=2018 |title=Involving recreational snorkelers in inventory improvement or creation: a case study in the Indian Ocean |journal=Cahiers de Biologie Marine |volume=59 |issue= |pages=451\u2013460 |doi=10.21411/CBM.A.B05FC714 }}</ref>\n\nSnorkelers may progress to [[free-diving]] or [[recreational scuba diving]], which should be preceded by at least some training from a dive instructor or experienced free-diver.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n=== Safety precautions ===\n[[File:Schnorchelweste snorkel vest.JPG|thumb|Snorkel vest]]\nSome commercial snorkeling organizations require snorkelers at their venue to wear an inflatable vest, similar to a [[personal flotation device]]. They are usually bright [[Yellow (colour)|yellow]] or [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and have a device that allows users to inflate or deflate the device to adjust their buoyancy. However, these devices hinder and prevent a snorkeler from free diving to any depth. Especially in cooler water, a wetsuit of appropriate thickness and coverage may be worn; wetsuits do provide some buoyancy without as much resistance to submersion. In the tropics, snorkelers (especially those with pale skin) often wear a [[rashguard]] or a shirt and/or [[board shorts]] in order to help protect the skin of the back and upper legs against sunburn.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe greatest danger to snorkelers are inshore and leisure craft such as jet skis, speed boats and the like. A snorkeler is often submerged in the water with only the tube visible above the surface. Since these craft can ply the same areas snorkelers visit, the chance for accidental collisions exists. Sailboats and sailboards are a particular hazard as their quiet propulsion systems may not alert the snorkeler of their presence. A snorkeler may surface underneath a vessel and/or be struck by it. Few locations demarcate small craft areas from snorkeling areas, unlike that done for regular beach-bathers, with areas marked by buoys. Snorkelers may therefore choose to wear bright or highly reflective colors/outfits and/or to employ [[dive flag]]s to enable easy spotting by boaters and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nSnorkelers' backs, ankles, and rear of their thighs can be exposed to the sun for extended periods, and can burn badly (even if slightly submerged), without being noticed in time. The wearing appropriate covering such as a \"[[rash guard]]\" with SPF (in warmer waters), a T-shirt, a wetsuit, and especially \"waterproof\" sunblock will mitigate this risk.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nDehydration is another concern. Hydrating well before entering the water is highly recommended, especially if one intends to snorkel for several hours. Proper hydration also prevents cramps. Snorkelers who hyperventilate to extend sub-surface time can experience [[hypocapnia]] if they hyperventilate prior to submerging. This can in turn lead to \"[[shallow water blackout]]\". Snorkeling with a buddy and remaining aware of the buddy's condition at all times can help avoid these difficulties.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nWhen snorkeling on or near [[coral reef]]s, care must be exercised to avoid contact with the delicate (and sometimes sharp or stinging) coral, and its poisonous inhabitants, usually by wearing protective gloves and being careful of one's environment. Coral scrapes and cuts often require specialized first aid treatment and potentially, emergency medical treatment to avoid infection. Booties and surf shoes are especially useful as they allow trekking over reefs exposed by low tide, to access drop-offs or deeper waters of the outer reef\u2014practices which are, however, considered ecologically irresponsible.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nContact with coral should always be avoided, because even boulder corals are fragile. Fin contact is a well-known cause of coral reef degradation.\n\nAnother safety concern is interaction and contact with the marine life during encounters.  While seals and sea turtles can seem harmless and docile, they can become alarmed if approached or feel threatened.  Some creatures, like moray eels, can hide in coral crevices and holes and will bite fingers in response to too much prodding.  For these reasons, snorkeling websites often recommend an \"observe but don't touch\" etiquette when snorkeling.<ref name=etiquette />\n\n===Snorkeling locations===\n[[File:Snorkelers watching fish.jpg|thumb|Snorkelers observing fish in [[Cozumel]], Mexico]]\nSnorkeling is possible in almost any body of water, but snorkelers are most likely to be found in locations where there are minimal waves, warm water, and something particularly interesting to see near the surface.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nGenerally shallow reefs ranging from {{convert|1|to|4|m|ft|sp=us|0}} are favored by snorkelers. Enough water cover to swim over the top without kicking the bottom is needed, but shallow structure can be approached from the sides. Deeper reefs can also be explored, but repeated breath-holding to dive to those depths limits the number of practitioners, and raises the bar on the required fitness and skill level. Risk increases with increased depth and duration of the breath-hold excursions from the surface.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Variants and related activities===\n*[[Bog snorkeling]]: An individual [[sport]], popular in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]].\n*[[Finswimming]]: An individual [[sport]], the most popular competitive sport of CMAS, the only of this federation present in [[World Games]].

In cooler waters, a [[wetsuit]] may also be worn. Use of this equipment allows the snorkeler to observe underwater attractions for extended periods  with relatively little effort and to breathe while face-down at the surface.\n\nSnorkeling is a popular [[recreation]]al activity, particularly at [[tropics|tropical]] [[resort]] locations. The primary appeal is the opportunity to observe [[marine biology#Lifeforms|underwater life]] in a natural setting without the complicated equipment and training required for [[scuba diving]]. It appeals to all ages because of how little effort there is, and without the exhaled bubbles of scuba-diving equipment. It is the basis of the two surface disciplines of the  [[underwater sports|underwater sport]] of [[finswimming]].<ref name=finswimmimg />\n\nSnorkeling is also used by scuba divers when on the surface, in underwater sports such as [[underwater hockey]] and [[underwater rugby]], and as part of water-based searches conducted by [[search and rescue]] teams.\n==Equipment==\nEssential equipment includes the [[Snorkel (swimming)|snorkel]] for breathing, and a [[diving mask]] or [[swimming goggles]] for vision. [[Swimfin]]s for more efficient propulsion are common. Environmental protection against cold, sunburn and marine stings and scratches is also regionally popular, and may be in the form of a [[wetsuit]], [[diving skins]], or [[rash vest]]. Some snorkellers rely on waterproof [[sunscreen]] lotions, but some of these are environmentally damaging. If necessary the snorkeller may wear a [[weightbelt]] to facilitate [[freediving]], or an inflatable snorkelling vest, a form of [[buoyancy aid]], for safety.\n\n=== Snorkel ===\n{{main|Snorkel (swimming)}}\n[[File:Vieques underwater a.jpg|thumb|Adult's snorkel]]\n[[File:Tuba enfant.jpg|thumb|Child's snorkel]]\nA snorkel is a device used for breathing air from above the surface when the wearer's head is face downwards in the water with the mouth and the nose submerged. It may be either separate or integrated into a swimming or diving [[diving mask|mask]]. The integrated version is only suitable for surface snorkeling, while the separate device may also be used for [[underwater sports|underwater activities]] such as [[spearfishing]], [[freediving]], [[finswimming]], [[underwater hockey]], [[underwater rugby]] and for surface breathing with [[scuba equipment]]. A swimmer's snorkel is a tube bent into a shape often resembling the letter \"L\" or \"J\", fitted with a [[mouthpiece (scuba)|mouthpiece]] at the lower end and constructed of light metal, [[rubber]] or [[plastic]]. The snorkel may come with a [[rubber]] loop or a plastic clip enabling the snorkel to be attached to the outside of the head strap of the [[diving mask]]. Although the snorkel may also be secured by tucking the tube between the mask-strap and the head, this alternative strategy can lead to physical discomfort, mask leakage or even snorkel loss.<ref>Steve Blount and Herb Taylor, ''The Joy of Snorkeling'', New York, NY: Pisces Book Company, 1984, p. 21.</ref>\n\nSnorkels constitute respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]]. When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in [[hypercapnia]]. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the [[tidal volume]] of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. A smaller diameter tube reduces the dead volume, but also increases resistance to airflow and so increases the work of breathing. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly expands the dead space. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply and slowly, as this reduces the dead space ratio and [[work of breathing]].\n\n[[File:Snorkel shapes.jpg|thumb|Basic snorkel shapes]]\nSnorkels come in two orientations: Front-mounted and side-mounted. The first snorkel to be patented in 1938 was front-mounted, worn with the tube over the front of the face and secured with a bracket to the diving mask. Front-mounted snorkels proved popular in European snorkeling until the late 1950s, when side-mounted snorkels came into the ascendancy. Front-mounted snorkels experienced a comeback a decade later as a piece of competitive swimming equipment to be used in pool workouts and in finswimming races, where they outperform side-mounted snorkels in streamlining.\n\n==== Plain snorkel ====\nA plain snorkel consists essentially of a tube with a mouthpiece to be inserted between the lips.\n[[File:Snorkel attachment methods.jpg|thumb|Snorkel attachment methods]]\n[[File:Snorkel mouthpieces.jpg|thumb|Snorkel mouthpieces]]\nThe barrel is the hollow tube leading from the supply end at the top of the snorkel to the mouthpiece at the bottom. The barrel is made of a relatively rigid material such as plastic, light metal or hard rubber. The bore is the interior chamber of the barrel; bore length, diameter and bends all affect breathing resistance.\n\nThe top of the barrel may be open to the elements or fitted with a valve designed to shut off the air supply from the atmosphere when the top is submerged. There may be a high visibility band around the top to alert other water users of the snorkeller's presence. The simplest way of attaching the snorkel to the head is to slip the top of the barrel between the mask strap and the head. This may cause the mask to leak, however, and alternative means of attachment of the barrel to the head include threading the mask strap a moulded on the barrel, using a figure-8 rubber snorkel keeper pulled down over the barrel, or a rotatable plastic snorkel keeper clipped to the barrel\n\nThe mouthpiece helps to keep the snorkel in the mouth. It is made of soft and flexible material, originally natural rubber and more recently silicone or [[PVC]]. The commonest of the multiple designs available<ref>P. P.

A tight grip with the teeth can also cause jaw fatigue and pain.\n\n====Full-face snorkel mask====\n[[File:Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask.jpg|thumb|Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask]]\nAn integrated snorkel consists essentially of a tube topped with a shut-off valve and opening at the bottom into the interior of a diving mask. Integrated snorkels must be fitted with valves to shut off the snorkel's air inlet when submerged. Water will otherwise pour into the opening at the top and flood the interior of the mask. Snorkels are attached to sockets on the top or the sides of the mask.\n\nNew-generation snorkel-masks are full-face masks covering the eyes, the nose and the mouth. They enable surface snorkellers to breathe nasally or orally and may be a workaround in the case of surface snorkellers who [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag]] in response to the presence of standard snorkel mouthpieces in their mouths. Some early snorkel-masks are full-face masks covering the eyes, nose and mouth, while others exclude the mouth, covering the eyes and the nose only. The 1950s [[US Divers]] \"Marino\" hybrid comprised a single snorkel mask with eye and nose coverage and a separate snorkel for the mouth.<ref>''Early Mfg. & Retailers - US Divers No.43''. Retrieved on 26 February 2019 at http://www.skindivinghistory.com/mfg_retailers/u/US_Divers/43.html.</ref>\n\nFull face snorkel masks use an integral snorkel with separate channels for intake and exhaled gases theoretically ensuring the user is always breathing untainted fresh air whatever the respiratory effort. Built-in dry top snorkel system. In addition to a standard ball float system that stops the water from entering the tube when submerged, full-face masks are designed in such a way that even if a small amount of water does get into the snorkel, it will be channeled away from the face and into the chin area of the mask. A special valve located on the bottom of the chin allows to drain the water out. The main problem is that it must fit the whole face well enough to make a reliable seal and since no two faces are the same shape, it may not seal adequately on any specific user. In the event of accidental flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing.{{Clarify|reason=can these masks  not be cleared in place?|date=September 2019}} Unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on the surface, or a couple of feet below, since the mask covers the nose with a rigid plastic structure, which makes it impossible to pinch the nose if needed to equalise pressure at greater depth. Trained scuba divers are likely to avoid such devices<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dipndive.com/blog/full-face-snorkeling-masks-pros-and-cons.html|title=Full-Face Snorkeling Masks: Pros And Cons|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}</ref> however snorkel masks are a boon for those with medical conditions that preclude taking part in scuba diving.{{cn|date=February 2019}}{{clarify|reason=how, specifically, are snorkel masks a \"boon\" for these people?|date=February 2019}}\n\nAs a result of a short period with an unusually high number of snorkeling deaths in Hawaii<ref>https://www.letsgotomaui.net/da-kine/full-face-snorkel-mask-dangers/</ref> there is some suspicion that the design of the masks can result in buildup of excess CO<sub>2</sub>. It is far from certain that the masks are at fault, but the state of Hawaii has begun to track the equipment being used in cases of snorkeling fatalities. Besides the possibility that the masks, or at least some brands of the mask, are a cause, other theories include the possibility that the masks make snorkeling accessible to people who have difficulty with traditional snorkeling equipment. That ease of access may result in more snorkelers who lack experience or have underlying medical conditions, possibly exacerbating problems that are unrelated to the type of equipment being used.<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-full-face-snorkel-mask-related-deaths/</ref>\n\nDuring the current [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic related shortages]], full-face snorkel masks have been adapted into oxygen dispensing emergency respiratory masks by using [[3D printing]] and minimal modifications to the original mask.<ref>[http://www.leparisien.fr/societe/coronavirus-quand-les-inventeurs-viennent-a-la-rescousse-des-hopitaux-23-03-2020-8286186.php Opoczynski, David (23 March 2020). \"Coronavirus : quand les inventeurs viennent \u00e0 la rescousse des h\u00f4pitaux\". leparisien.fr].

By creating an airspace, the mask enables the snorkeler to see clearly underwater. All scuba diving masks consist of the lenses also known as a faceplate, a soft rubber skirt, which encloses the nose and seals against the face, and a head strap to hold it in place. There are different styles and shapes. These range from oval shaped models to lower internal volume masks and may be made from different materials; common choices are silicone and rubber. A snorkeler who remains at the surface can use swimmer's goggles which do not enclose the nose.\n\n===Swimfins===\n{{Main|Swimfin}}\nSwimfins, fins or flippers are [[fin]]like accessories worn on the feet,<ref name=\"AlainPerrier\" />  and usually made from [[rubber]] or [[plastic]], to aid movement through the water in [[Water sport (recreation)|water sports]] activities.

The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to conduct heat. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water. The thickness, fit and coverage of the suit are important factors for insulation.\n\n[[Diving suit#Dive skins|Dive skins]] are used when diving in water temperatures above {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. They are usually one piece full length garments made from [[spandex|spandex or Lycra]] and provide little thermal protection, but do protect the skin from [[jellyfish]] stings, abrasion and [[sunburn]]. This kind of suit is also known as a 'Stinger Suit'. Some divers wear a dive skin under a wetsuit, which allows easier donning and (for those who experience skin problems from neoprene) provides additional comfort.<ref name=\"EcoStinger 2014\" />\n\nA [[rash guard]], also known as rash vest or rashie, is an athletic shirt made of spandex and nylon or polyester. The name rash guard reflects the fact that the shirt protects the wearer against rashes caused by abrasion, or by sunburn from extended exposure to the sun. These shirts can be worn by themselves, or under a wetsuit. A rash guard by itself is used for light coverage in warm to extreme summer temperatures for several watersports including snorkeling. There are also lower body rash guards, which are similar to compression shorts to be worn under the surfers' boardshorts.\n\n===Weight belt===\n{{See also|Diver weighting system#Weight belt}}\n[[File:Zavorra.JPG|thumb|Typical weight belt ]]\nWeight belts are the most common weighting system currently in use for snorkeling.<ref>[http://ygraine.membrane.com/enterhtml/live/scuba/products.html Scuba diving air Regulators, buoyancy compensators scuba diving equipment, information advice help with scuba gear products safety - Philadelphia Area Dive Shops<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621090205/http://ygraine.membrane.com/enterhtml/live/scuba/products.html |date=June 21, 2007 }}</ref> They are generally made of tough [[nylon]] webbing, but other materials such as [[rubber]] can be used. Weight belts for snorkeling are generally fitted with a quick release buckle to allow the dumping of weight rapidly in an emergency.\n\nThe most common design of weight used with a belt is rectangular [[lead]] blocks with two slots in them threaded onto the belt. These blocks can be coated in [[plastic]], which increases corrosion resistance. The plastic coated weights may be marketed as being less abrasive to [[wetsuits]]. The weights may be constrained from sliding along the webbing by metal or plastic [[Glossary of underwater diving terminology#belt slide|belt sliders]]. Another popular style has a single slot through which the belt can be threaded. These are sometimes locked in position by squeezing the weight to grip the webbing, but this makes them difficult to remove when less weight is needed. There are also weight designs which may be added to the belt by clipping on when needed. The amount of weight needed depends mainly on the buoyancy of the wet suit.\n\n===Snorkeling vest===\nAn inflatable [[Personal flotation device|personal buoyancy aid]] designed for surface swimming applications. In shape, often like a horse-collar [[Buoyancy compensator (diving)|buoyancy compensator]], or [[airline]] [[life jacket]], but only with oral inflation or a CO<sub>2</sub> cartridge for emergencies.\n\n== Operation ==\nThe simplest type of snorkel is a plain tube that is allowed to flood when [[underwater]]. The snorkeler expels water from the snorkel either with a sharp exhalation on return to the surface (''blast clearing'') or by tilting the head back shortly before reaching the surface and exhaling until reaching or breaking the surface (''displacement method'') and facing forward or down again before inhaling the next breath. The displacement method expels water by filling the snorkel with air; it is a technique that takes practice but clears the snorkel with less effort, but only works when surfacing. Clearing splash water while at the surface requires blast clearing.<ref>Underwater World, ''Unit 3- Diving Skills''. Retrieved on 28 February 2019 at https://www.diveunderwaterworld.com/s/Chapter-3-Diving-Skills.pdf.</ref>\n\nExperienced users tend to develop a surface breathing style which minimises work of breathing, carbon dioxide buildup and risk of water inspiration, while optimising water removal. This involves a sharp puff in the early stage of exhalation, which is effective for clearing the tube of remaining water, and a fairly large but comfortable exhaled volume, mostly fairly slowly for low work of breathing, followed by an immediate slow inhalation, which reduces entrainment of any residual water, to a comfortable but relatively large inhaled volume, repeated without delay. Elastic recoil is used to assist with the initial puff, which can be made sharper by controlling the start of exhalation with the tongue. This technique is most applicable to relaxed cruising on the surface. Racing finswimmers may use a different technique as they need a far greater level of ventilation when working hard. \n\nSome snorkels have a [[sump]] at the lowest point to allow a small volume of water to remain in the snorkel without being inhaled when the snorkeler breathes. Some also have a [[non-return valve]] in the sump, to drain water in the tube when the diver exhales. The water is pushed out through the valve when the tube is blocked by water and the exhalation pressure exceeds the water pressure on the outside of the valve. This is almost exactly the mechanism of blast clearing which does not require the valve, but the pressure required is marginally less, and effective blast clearing requires a higher flow rate. The full face mask has a double airflow valve which allows breathing through the nose in addition to the mouth.<ref>Snorkel Ken, \"Full Face Snorkel Mask Reviews | Tribord EasyBreathe Alternatives and Best Prices\". Retrieved on 3 March 2019 at https://snorkelstore.net/full-face-snorkel-mask-review-lower-price-lower-quality/.</ref> A few models of snorkel have float-operated valves attached to the top end of the tube to keep water out when a wave passes, but these cause problems when diving as the snorkel must then be equalized during descent, using part of the diver's inhaled air supply. Some recent designs have a splash deflector on the top end that reduces entry of any water that splashes over the top end of the tube, thereby keeping it relatively free from water.<ref>US patent 5,404,872, ''Splash-guard for snorkel tubes'', April 11, 1995.

Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://monofin.co.uk/blog-snorkels.html</ref>\n\nA common problem with all mechanical clearing mechanisms is their tendency to fail if infrequently used, or if stored for long periods, or through environmental fouling, or owing to lack of maintenance. Many also either slightly increase the flow resistance of the snorkel, or provide a small water trap, which retains a little water in the tube after clearing.<ref>''Snorkel Care''. Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://www.scubadoctor.com.au/care-snorkel.htm.</ref>\n\nModern designs use [[silicone rubber]] in the mouthpiece and one-way clearing and float valves due to its resistance to degradation and its long service life. [[Natural rubber]] was formerly used, but slowly oxidizes and breaks down due to ultraviolet light exposure from the sun. It eventually loses its flexibility, becomes brittle and cracks, which can cause clearing valves to stick in the open or closed position, and float valves to leak due to a failure of the valve seat to seal. In even older designs, some snorkels were made with small \"[[ping pong]]\" balls in a [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]] mounted to the open end of the tube to prevent water ingress. These are no longer sold or recommended because they are unreliable and considered hazardous. Similarly, [[diving mask]]s with a built-in snorkel are considered unsafe by scuba diving organizations such as PADI, BSAC because they can engender a false sense of security and can be difficult to clear if flooded.\n\nA snorkel may be either separate or integrated into a swim or dive [[diving mask|mask]]. Usage of the term \"snorkel\" in this section excludes devices integrated with, and opening into, swimmers' or divers' masks. A separate snorkel typically comprises a tube for breathing and a means of attaching the tube to the head of the wearer. The tube has an opening at the top and a mouthpiece at the bottom. Some tubes are topped with a valve to prevent water from entering the tube when it is [[Underwater|submerged]].\n\nThe total length, inner diameter and/or inner volume of a snorkel tube are matters of utmost importance because they affect the user's ability to breathe normally while swimming or floating head downwards on the surface of the water. These dimensions also have implications for the user's ability to blow residual water out of the tube when surfacing. An overlong snorkel tube may cause breathing resistance, while an overwide tube may prove hard to clear of water. A high-volume tube is liable to encourage a build-up of stale air, including exhaled carbon dioxide, because it constitutes respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]].\n\n==Practice of snorkeling ==\n[[File:Sea Garden of BUNAKEN.jpg|thumb|Snorkeler with mask and snorkel]]\nSnorkeling is an activity in its own right, as well as an adjunct to other activities, such as breath-hold diving, [[spearfishing]] and [[scuba diving]],<ref name=\"NOAA Diving Manual 1979\" /> and several competitive [[underwater sports]], such as [[underwater hockey]] and [[finswimming]]. In all cases, the use of a snorkel facilitates breathing while swimming at the surface and observing what is going on under the water.\n\nBeing non-competitive, snorkeling is considered more a leisure activity than a [[sport]].<ref name=\"Jennings2007\">{{cite book|author=Gayle Jennings|title=Water-Based Tourism, Sport, Leisure, and Recreation Experiences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sBAGX5l5uuwC&pg=PA130|date=2 April 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-34928-7|pages=130\u2013}}</ref> Snorkeling requires no special training, only the very basic swimming abilities and being able to breathe through the snorkel.<ref name=\"Fodor's1988\">{{cite book|author=Fodor's|title=Fodor's 89 Cancun, Cozumel, Merida, the Yucatan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lt5pggSPkwkC|year=1988|publisher=Fodor's Travel Publications|isbn=978-0-679-01610-6}}</ref> Some organizations, such as BSAC, {{by whom|date=August 2015}} recommend that for snorkeling safety one should not snorkel alone,<ref name=safety /> but rather with a \"[[buddy diving|buddy]]\", a [[guide]] or a tour group.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n[[Underwater photography]] has become more and more popular since the early 2000s, resulting in millions of pictures posted every year on various websites and social media. This mass of documentation is endowed with an enormous scientific potential, as millions of tourists possess a much superior coverage power than professional scientists, who can not allow themselves to spend so much time in the field. \nAs a consequence, several participative sciences programs have been developed, supported by geo-localization and identification web sites, along with protocols for auto-organization and self-teaching aimed at biodiversity-interested snorkelers, in order for them to turn their observations into sound scientific data, available for research. This kind of approach has been successfully used in [[R\u00e9union island]], allowing for tens of new records and even new species.<ref name=\"CBM2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Bourjon |first1=Philippe |last2=Ducarme |first2=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric |last3=Quod |first3=Jean-Pascal |last4=Sweet |first4=Michael |year=2018 |title=Involving recreational snorkelers in inventory improvement or creation: a case study in the Indian Ocean |journal=Cahiers de Biologie Marine |volume=59 |issue= |pages=451\u2013460 |doi=10.21411/CBM.A.B05FC714 }}</ref>\n\nSnorkelers may progress to [[free-diving]] or [[recreational scuba diving]], which should be preceded by at least some training from a dive instructor or experienced free-diver.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n=== Safety precautions ===\n[[File:Schnorchelweste snorkel vest.JPG|thumb|Snorkel vest]]\nSome commercial snorkeling organizations require snorkelers at their venue to wear an inflatable vest, similar to a [[personal flotation device]]. They are usually bright [[Yellow (colour)|yellow]] or [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and have a device that allows users to inflate or deflate the device to adjust their buoyancy. However, these devices hinder and prevent a snorkeler from free diving to any depth. Especially in cooler water, a wetsuit of appropriate thickness and coverage may be worn; wetsuits do provide some buoyancy without as much resistance to submersion. In the tropics, snorkelers (especially those with pale skin) often wear a [[rashguard]] or a shirt and/or [[board shorts]] in order to help protect the skin of the back and upper legs against sunburn.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe greatest danger to snorkelers are inshore and leisure craft such as jet skis, speed boats and the like. A snorkeler is often submerged in the water with only the tube visible above the surface. Since these craft can ply the same areas snorkelers visit, the chance for accidental collisions exists. Sailboats and sailboards are a particular hazard as their quiet propulsion systems may not alert the snorkeler of their presence. A snorkeler may surface underneath a vessel and/or be struck by it. Few locations demarcate small craft areas from snorkeling areas, unlike that done for regular beach-bathers, with areas marked by buoys. Snorkelers may therefore choose to wear bright or highly reflective colors/outfits and/or to employ [[dive flag]]s to enable easy spotting by boaters and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nSnorkelers' backs, ankles, and rear of their thighs can be exposed to the sun for extended periods, and can burn badly (even if slightly submerged), without being noticed in time. The wearing appropriate covering such as a \"[[rash guard]]\" with SPF (in warmer waters), a T-shirt, a wetsuit, and especially \"waterproof\" sunblock will mitigate this risk.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nDehydration is another concern. Hydrating well before entering the water is highly recommended, especially if one intends to snorkel for several hours. Proper hydration also prevents cramps. Snorkelers who hyperventilate to extend sub-surface time can experience [[hypocapnia]] if they hyperventilate prior to submerging. This can in turn lead to \"[[shallow water blackout]]\". Snorkeling with a buddy and remaining aware of the buddy's condition at all times can help avoid these difficulties.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nWhen snorkeling on or near [[coral reef]]s, care must be exercised to avoid contact with the delicate (and sometimes sharp or stinging) coral, and its poisonous inhabitants, usually by wearing protective gloves and being careful of one's environment. Coral scrapes and cuts often require specialized first aid treatment and potentially, emergency medical treatment to avoid infection. Booties and surf shoes are especially useful as they allow trekking over reefs exposed by low tide, to access drop-offs or deeper waters of the outer reef\u2014practices which are, however, considered ecologically irresponsible.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nContact with coral should always be avoided, because even boulder corals are fragile. Fin contact is a well-known cause of coral reef degradation.\n\nAnother safety concern is interaction and contact with the marine life during encounters.  While seals and sea turtles can seem harmless and docile, they can become alarmed if approached or feel threatened.  Some creatures, like moray eels, can hide in coral crevices and holes and will bite fingers in response to too much prodding.  For these reasons, snorkeling websites often recommend an \"observe but don't touch\" etiquette when snorkeling.<ref name=etiquette />\n\n===Snorkeling locations===\n[[File:Snorkelers watching fish.jpg|thumb|Snorkelers observing fish in [[Cozumel]], Mexico]]\nSnorkeling is possible in almost any body of water, but snorkelers are most likely to be found in locations where there are minimal waves, warm water, and something particularly interesting to see near the surface.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nGenerally shallow reefs ranging from {{convert|1|to|4|m|ft|sp=us|0}} are favored by snorkelers. Enough water cover to swim over the top without kicking the bottom is needed, but shallow structure can be approached from the sides. Deeper reefs can also be explored, but repeated breath-holding to dive to those depths limits the number of practitioners, and raises the bar on the required fitness and skill level. Risk increases with increased depth and duration of the breath-hold excursions from the surface.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Variants and related activities===\n*[[Bog snorkeling]]: An individual [[sport]], popular in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]].\n*[[Finswimming]]: An individual [[sport]], the most popular competitive sport of CMAS, the only of this federation present in [[World Games]].
