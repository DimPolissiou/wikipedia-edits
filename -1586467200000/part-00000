Her first credited film appearance was in 1924 in \"A Maid of the Genroku Era\" in 1924, which also marked the start of her affiliation with the [[Shochiku]] Studios. She married director [[Hiroshi Shimizu (director)|Hiroshi Shimizu]] in 1929 after appearing in a number of his films in the 1920s. Although they divorced after less than a year, she later played in a number of films directed by her ex-husband.<ref name=Jasper/>\n\nShe became a leading actress at an early age, appearing in [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]'s ''[[I Graduated, But...]]'' in 1929. The following year she played the lead in ''[[Aiyoku no ki]]'', and in 1931 she appeared in Japan's first [[talkie]], ''[[The Neighbor's Wife and Mine]]'', directed by [[Heinosuke Gosho]]. In the 1930s, she became so popular that the titles of her films used her name, as in \"The Kinuyo Story\" (''Kinuyo Monogatari'') in 1930, \"Doctor Kinuyo\" (''Joi Kinuyo sensei'') in 1937 and \"Kinuyo\u2019s First Love\" (''Kinuyo no hatsukoi'') in 1940. In 1938, she starred in Hiromasa Nomura\u2019s ''[[Flower in Storm]]'' (\u611b\u67d3\u304b\u3064\u3089 Aizen-Katsura) with [[Ken Uehara]], which was the highest-grossing movie of the prewar period.<ref name=Jasper/> In 1940, she worked for the first time with Kenji Mizoguchi, starring in \"A Woman of Osaka\" (''Naniwa Onna''), which has not survived. It marked the start of her transition to more challenging roles.\n\n===Post-war career===\nTanaka made a three-month trip to the United States starting in October 1949 as one of Japan\u2019s first post-war cultural envoys <ref name=Jasper/> On her return, she resigned from Shochiku, and announced her intention of going freelance, which would give her more scope to choose which directors she wished to work with. She worked on several movies with [[Mikio Naruse]], [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]], and also [[Keisuke Kinoshita]] (including ''[[The Ballad of Narayama (1958 film)|The Ballad Of Narayama]]'' for which she was awarded the Best Actress Award from the magazine ''[[Kinema Junpo]]'').<ref name=Jasper/> She had a close working relationship with director Kenji Mizoguchi, having parts in 15 of his films, including leading roles in ''[[The Life of Oharu]]'' (1952), ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (1953) and ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' (1954). Their working relationship ended when Mizoguchi countered a recommendation from the [[Directors Guild of Japan]] for the [[Nikkatsu]] studio to hire her as a director. Despite this, the production of her second film as director went ahead, but Tanaka never forgave Mizoguchi, and the reasons for his behaviour are unclear.<ref>Tony Rayns video essays in the [[Masters of Cinema]] edition of ''[[The Crucified Lovers|Chikamatsu Monogatari]]''/''[[The Woman in the Rumor|Uwasa no onna]]'' set.</ref>\n\n===Director and actress===\nTanaka was the second Japanese woman who worked as a film director, after [[Sakane Tazuko]] (1904\u20101975). Her first directing job was on the film ''[[Love Letter (1953 film)|Love Letter]]'' in 1953, scripted by Kinoshita, was entered as a contestant in the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1954. She directed five further films between 1953 and 1962. The \"Moon Has Risen\" (''Tsuki wa noborinu'') in 1955 was scripted by Yasujir\u014d Ozu and the \"Wandering Princess\" (''Ruten no onna'') starring [[Machiko Ky\u014d]], was scripted by the wife of [[Kon Ichikawa]].<ref name=Jasper/> However, as well as directing, Tanaka continued with her acting career, appearing as Yasumoto's mother in [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Red Beard]]'' (1965).

In the 1930s, she became so popular that the titles of her films used her name, as in \"The Kinuyo Story\" (''Kinuyo Monogatari'') in 1930, \"Doctor Kinuyo\" (''Joi Kinuyo sensei'') in 1937 and \"Kinuyo\u2019s First Love\" (''Kinuyo no hatsukoi'') in 1940. In 1938, she starred in Hiromasa Nomura\u2019s ''[[Flower in Storm]]'' (\u611b\u67d3\u304b\u3064\u3089 Aizen-Katsura) with [[Ken Uehara]], which was the highest-grossing movie of the prewar period.<ref name=Jasper/> In 1940, she worked for the first time with Kenji Mizoguchi, starring in \"A Woman of Osaka\" (''Naniwa Onna''), which has not survived. It marked the start of her transition to more challenging roles.\n\n===Post-war career===\nTanaka made a three-month trip to the United States starting in October 1949 as one of Japan\u2019s first post-war cultural envoys <ref name=Jasper/> On her return, she resigned from Shochiku, and announced her intention of going freelance, which would give her more scope to choose which directors she wished to work with. She worked on several movies with [[Mikio Naruse]], [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]], and also [[Keisuke Kinoshita]] (including ''[[The Ballad of Narayama (1958 film)|The Ballad Of Narayama]]'' for which she was awarded the Best Actress Award from the magazine ''[[Kinema Junpo]]'').<ref name=Jasper/> She had a close working relationship with director Kenji Mizoguchi, having parts in 15 of his films, including leading roles in ''[[The Life of Oharu]]'' (1952), ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (1953) and ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' (1954). Their working relationship ended when Mizoguchi countered a recommendation from the [[Directors Guild of Japan]] for the [[Nikkatsu]] studio to hire her as a director. Despite this, the production of her second film as director went ahead, but Tanaka never forgave Mizoguchi, and the reasons for his behaviour are unclear.<ref>Tony Rayns video essays in the [[Masters of Cinema]] edition of ''[[The Crucified Lovers|Chikamatsu Monogatari]]''/''[[The Woman in the Rumor|Uwasa no onna]]'' set.</ref>\n\n===Director and actress===\nTanaka was the second Japanese woman who worked as a film director, after [[Sakane Tazuko]] (1904\u20101975). Her first directing job was on the film ''[[Love Letter (1953 film)|Love Letter]]'' in 1953, scripted by Kinoshita, was entered as a contestant in the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1954. She directed five further films between 1953 and 1962. The \"Moon Has Risen\" (''Tsuki wa noborinu'') in 1955 was scripted by Yasujir\u014d Ozu and the \"Wandering Princess\" (''Ruten no onna'') starring [[Machiko Ky\u014d]], was scripted by the wife of [[Kon Ichikawa]].<ref name=Jasper/> However, as well as directing, Tanaka continued with her acting career, appearing as Yasumoto's mother in [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Red Beard]]'' (1965).

The series premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on October 21, 1997. Although 11 episodes (plus a [[Television pilot|pilot]]) were produced, the series was canceled after only three had aired.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter being fired from the [[soap opera]] ''Days to Remember'', down on his luck, eccentric, self-centered actor Simon Ferguson (Tim Curry) moves into [[Manhattan]]'s Metropolitan Hotel, which is run by ex-wife Hadley Martin (Annie Potts), whom he was married to 20 years prior... for twelve days.  Despite her initial exasperation with her ex, Hadley again succumbs to the \"Ferguson charm\", as do all of those around her.\n\nSimon reluctantly plays role model to Hadley's children from a different marriage: precocious {{frac|7|1|2}}-year-old Daniel ([[Luke Tarsitano]]) and angst-ridden teen Gwen ([[Marla Sokoloff]]).  The hotel's psychotic Greek chef, Yorgo Galfanikos ([[Steve Carell]]), also looks up to Simon, having been a fan of his soap opera and films.  Also seen are Rose ([[Liz Torres]]), the hotel's assistant manager, Robert McSwain ([[John O'Hurley]]), the hotel's main investor, Tommy Sutton (Devin Neil Oatway), a popular jock Gwen fawns over, and Jesse ([[Danny Strong]]), a geek who is smitten with Gwen.\n\nEpisodes mostly centered around Simon's outlandish shenanigans and attempts to break back into show business.\n\n==Cast & Characters==\n*[[Tim Curry]] as Simon Ferguson<br />The star of his acting class, Simon was a British actor with a promising career ahead of him, even garnering an [[Academy Award]] nomination in 1977, but his ego got in the way. After gaining a reputation for being difficult to work with, he was forced to take roles in [[straight-to-video]] fare like \"''[[Hardbodies|Hardbodies 3]]'',\" and eventually the trashy TV [[soap opera]] \"''Days to Remember''.\"  Simon's only real friend is Hadley, whom he was briefly married to decades earlier.\n*[[Annie Potts]] as Hadley Martin<br />Hailing from [[Tennessee]], Hadley moved to [[New York City|New York]] to pursue an acting career, but following a string of rejection and failed marriages, she found herself playing a single-mom to a pair of kids while managing a hotel in [[Manhattan]].\n*[[Steve Carell]] as Yorgo Galfanikos<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Yorgo Calfanikos (character)\n|publisher=Internet Movie Database\n|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0168426/\n|accessdate=2009-12-31\n}}</ref><br />A [[Greeks|Greek]] immigrant who's obsessed with presenting the perfect meal, chef Yorgo exudes a manic temperament that comes across as hostile even when he's being sincere.\n*[[Luke Tarsitano]] as Daniel Martin<br />Hadley's 7-year-old son questions everything and is a constant source of aggravation for both his sister and Simon.\n*[[Marla Sokoloff]] as Gwen Martin<br />Hadley's defiant teenage daughter, who's smitten with boys and social status.\n*[[Liz Torres]] as Rose<br />The hefty Assistant Manager of The Metropolitan Hotel, the Hispanic Rose takes no guff from anyone and is quick to spout off her opinion on any subject.\n*[[John O'Hurley]] as Robert McSwain<br />The infrequently-seen hotel investor is conservative to the point of being repressed, and his crush on Hadley is transparent.\n\n==Production==\nThe show was pitched in early 1996 to ABC president [[Ted Harbert]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Paeth|first=Greg |title=You'll Be Underwhelmed By ABC's 'Over the Top'|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|date=October 21, 1997}}</ref> and although it would not be ready to hit the air for the 1996-1997 season, it remained in development.

Although flabbergasted with Simon, Kate ultimately decided to let her ex stay on as a new addition to the staff.  The cast was rounded out by [[Luke Tarsitano]] and [[Natanya Ross]] as Kate's children from a subsequent marriage, [[Debra Jo Rupp]] as the maid, and a then-unknown actor named [[Steve Carell]] as manic chef Yorgo.\n\nBy the time the pilot was filmed, ABC Entertainment president [[Ted Harbert]] had been replaced by [[Jamie Tarses]], whom executive producer [[Robert Morton (producer)|Robert Morton]] was dating.<ref name=sun>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-10-21/lifestyle/9710200200_1_fawlty-towers-premiere-week-simon-ferguson|title='Top' a Flop|last=Jicha |first=Tom|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel|Sun-Sentinel]]|date=October 21, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>  Rumors began to swirl that the series was only picked up as a result of their romance, and it did not help matters that the press was only shown snippets of the pilot episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/glow/1997/10/21glow.html|title=Blue Glow|last=Millman|first=Joyce|publisher=[[salon.com]]|date=October 21, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>  In the months between the time the series was picked up and its scheduled premiere, Morton and Tarses' relationship ended.\n\nOriginally slated to debut on September 23, 1997<ref name=EW>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289604,00.html|title=On the Air: September 26, 1997|last=Flint |first=Joe |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 26, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref> the show's premiere was delayed until October 21, opposite the [[World Series]],<ref name=sun /> so it could be retooled.

Kate was renamed Hadley and her character became more sympathetic toward Simon. The setting was changed to New York City and the pilot was reshot (as the episode \"I'm Bonnie, I'm Clyde\").

The series premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on October 21, 1997. Although 11 episodes (plus a [[Television pilot|pilot]]) were produced, the series was canceled after only three had aired.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter being fired from the [[soap opera]] ''Days to Remember'', down on his luck, eccentric, self-centered actor Simon Ferguson (Tim Curry) moves into [[Manhattan]]'s Metropolitan Hotel, which is run by ex-wife Hadley Martin (Annie Potts), whom he was married to 20 years prior... for twelve days.  Despite her initial exasperation with her ex, Hadley again succumbs to the \"Ferguson charm\", as do all of those around her.\n\nSimon reluctantly plays role model to Hadley's children from a different marriage: precocious {{frac|7|1|2}}-year-old Daniel ([[Luke Tarsitano]]) and angst-ridden teen Gwen ([[Marla Sokoloff]]).  The hotel's psychotic Greek chef, Yorgo Galfanikos ([[Steve Carell]]), also looks up to Simon, having been a fan of his soap opera and films.  Also seen are Rose ([[Liz Torres]]), the hotel's assistant manager, Robert McSwain ([[John O'Hurley]]), the hotel's main investor, Tommy Sutton (Devin Neil Oatway), a popular jock Gwen fawns over, and Jesse ([[Danny Strong]]), a geek who is smitten with Gwen.\n\nEpisodes mostly centered around Simon's outlandish shenanigans and attempts to break back into show business.\n\n==Cast & Characters==\n*[[Tim Curry]] as Simon Ferguson<br />The star of his acting class, Simon was a British actor with a promising career ahead of him, even garnering an [[Academy Award]] nomination in 1977, but his ego got in the way. After gaining a reputation for being difficult to work with, he was forced to take roles in [[straight-to-video]] fare like \"''[[Hardbodies|Hardbodies 3]]'',\" and eventually the trashy TV [[soap opera]] \"''Days to Remember''.\"  Simon's only real friend is Hadley, whom he was briefly married to decades earlier.\n*[[Annie Potts]] as Hadley Martin<br />Hailing from [[Tennessee]], Hadley moved to [[New York]] to pursue an acting career, but following a string of rejection and failed marriages, she found herself playing a single-mom to a pair of kids while managing a hotel in [[Manhattan]].\n*[[Steve Carell]] as Yorgo Galfanikos<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Yorgo Calfanikos (character)\n|publisher=Internet Movie Database\n|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0168426/\n|accessdate=2009-12-31\n}}</ref><br />A [[Greeks|Greek]] immigrant who's obsessed with presenting the perfect meal, chef Yorgo exudes a manic temperament that comes across as hostile even when he's being sincere.\n*[[Luke Tarsitano]] as Daniel Martin<br />Hadley's 7-year-old son questions everything and is a constant source of aggravation for both his sister and Simon.\n*[[Marla Sokoloff]] as Gwen Martin<br />Hadley's defiant teenage daughter, who's smitten with boys and social status.\n*[[Liz Torres]] as Rose<br />The hefty Assistant Manager of The Metropolitan Hotel, the Hispanic Rose takes no guff from anyone and is quick to spout off her opinion on any subject.\n*[[John O'Hurley]] as Robert McSwain<br />The infrequently-seen hotel investor is conservative to the point of being repressed, and his crush on Hadley is transparent.\n\n==Production==\nThe show was pitched in early 1996 to ABC president [[Ted Harbert]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Paeth|first=Greg |title=You'll Be Underwhelmed By ABC's 'Over the Top'|work=[[The Cincinnati Post]]|date=October 21, 1997}}</ref> and although it would not be ready to hit the air for the 1996-1997 season, it remained in development.

Although flabbergasted with Simon, Kate ultimately decided to let her ex stay on as a new addition to the staff.  The cast was rounded out by [[Luke Tarsitano]] and [[Natanya Ross]] as Kate's children from a subsequent marriage, [[Debra Jo Rupp]] as the maid, and a then-unknown actor named [[Steve Carell]] as manic chef Yorgo.\n\nBy the time the pilot was filmed, ABC Entertainment president [[Ted Harbert]] had been replaced by [[Jamie Tarses]], whom executive producer [[Robert Morton (producer)|Robert Morton]] was dating.<ref name=sun>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1997-10-21/lifestyle/9710200200_1_fawlty-towers-premiere-week-simon-ferguson|title='Top' a Flop|last=Jicha |first=Tom|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel|Sun-Sentinel]]|date=October 21, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>  Rumors began to swirl that the series was only picked up as a result of their romance, and it did not help matters that the press was only shown snippets of the pilot episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/glow/1997/10/21glow.html|title=Blue Glow|last=Millman|first=Joyce|publisher=[[salon.com]]|date=October 21, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref>  In the months between the time the series was picked up and its scheduled premiere, Morton and Tarses' relationship ended.\n\nOriginally slated to debut on September 23, 1997<ref name=EW>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,289604,00.html|title=On the Air: September 26, 1997|last=Flint |first=Joe |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 26, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref> the show's premiere was delayed until October 21, opposite the [[World Series]],<ref name=sun /> so it could be retooled.

Kate was renamed Hadley and her character became more sympathetic toward Simon. The setting was changed to New York City and the pilot was reshot (as the episode \"I'm Bonnie, I'm Clyde\").  The reason given for the retooling was because in NYC there would be more opportunities \"for comedic interaction with city characters\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/09/arts/if-they-can-make-it-there.html|title=If They Can Make It There|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 9, 1997|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}</ref> but the press began to speculate that the changes were again a result of the failed Tarses/Morton romance.

Directed by [[Jon Favreau]] and written by [[Justin Theroux]], the film stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Tony Stark / Iron Man, alongside [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Mickey Rourke]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Six months after the events of ''Iron Man'', Tony Stark is resisting calls by the United States government to hand over the Iron Man technology while also combating his declining health from the arc reactor in his chest. Meanwhile, rogue Russian scientist [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]] has developed the same technology and built weapons of his own in order to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family, in the process, joining forces with Stark's business rival, [[Justin Hammer]].\n\nFollowing the successful release of ''Iron Man'' in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July of that same year, Theroux was hired to write the script, and Favreau was signed to return and direct. Downey, Paltrow, and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from ''Iron Man'', while Cheadle was brought in to replace [[Terrence Howard]] in the role of [[War Machine|James Rhodes]]. In the early months of 2009, Rourke, Rockwell, and Johansson filled out the supporting cast, and filming took place from April to July of that year. Like its predecessor, the film was shot mostly in [[California]], except for a key sequence in [[Monaco]].\n\n''Iron Man 2'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on April 26, 2010, and was released in the United States on May 7, 2010. The film received generally positive reviews, with praise for Downey's performance as well as for the action sequences, musical score and visual effects. However, the film received criticism for its villain and pacing, with many critics deeming the film inferior to the original. The film was commercially successful, grossing over $623.9 million at the worldwide box office, making it the [[2010 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of 2010]], and receiving an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. The third and final installment of the ''Iron Man'' series, ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', was released on May 3, 2013.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn Russia, the media covers [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]], whose father, [[Crimson Dynamo#Anton Vanko|Anton Vanko]], has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" />}} Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father [[Howard Stark|Howard]]'s legacy.\n\nLater, Stark learns that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps him alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant [[Pepper Potts]] as CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]], where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, wielding electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer]], fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV Iron Man suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, [[U.S. Air Force]] Lieutenant Colonel [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], dons Stark's Mark II armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, and Rhodes confiscates the armor for the U.S. Air Force.\n\n[[Nick Fury]], director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], approaches Stark, revealing that \"Rushman\" is Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father and Stark invented the arc reactor together, but when Anton tried to sell it, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the Gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material. Tony discovers a hidden message in the [[diorama]] of the 1974 Stark Expo; it proves to be a diagram of the atomic structure of a new element. With the aid of his A.I., [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark synthesizes it. When he learns that Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency.\n\nAt the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI to warn Rhodes, but Vanko takes remote control of all the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Stark. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of Rhodes' armor to him. Together, Stark and Rhodes defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko commits [[suicide]] by blowing up his suit, along with the defeated drones.\n\nAt a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. In a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]] reports the discovery of [[Mjolnir (comics)|a large hammer]] at the bottom of a crater in a desert in New Mexico.{{refn|name=Thor|group=N|As depicted in the 2011 film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 150\n| footer = Downey, Johansson and Rockwell promoting the film at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International\n| image1 = Robert Downey Jr SDCC 2009 3.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Scarlett Johansson SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Sam Rockwell SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| align = \n| total_width = \n}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: <br />A billionaire who escaped captivity in [[Afghanistan]] with a suit of armor he created, he now struggles to keep his technology out of the government's hands.

After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including [[Mark Millar]], Stane became the main villain in ''Iron Man''.

Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' happen in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''.

So, Legacy created what we called the \"football suits\" from the torso up with a chest plate and helmet. We'd usually put in some arm pieces, but not the whole arm. In the house fight sequence, where Robert Downey Jr. staggers around tipsy, we used some of the practical suit and extended it digitally. Same thing in the [[Randy's Donuts]] scene.

Directed by [[Jon Favreau]] and written by [[Justin Theroux]], the film stars [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Tony Stark / Iron Man, alongside [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Don Cheadle]], [[Scarlett Johansson]], [[Sam Rockwell]], [[Mickey Rourke]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]]. Six months after the events of ''Iron Man'', Tony Stark is resisting calls by the United States government to hand over the Iron Man technology while also combating his declining health from the arc reactor in his chest. Meanwhile, rogue Russian scientist [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]] has developed the same technology and built weapons of his own in order to pursue a vendetta against the Stark family, in the process, joining forces with Stark's business rival, [[Justin Hammer]].\n\nFollowing the successful release of ''Iron Man'' in May 2008, Marvel Studios announced and immediately set to work on producing a sequel. In July of that same year, Theroux was hired to write the script, and Favreau was signed to return and direct. Downey, Paltrow, and Jackson were set to reprise their roles from ''Iron Man'', while Cheadle was brought in to replace [[Terrence Howard]] in the role of [[War Machine|James Rhodes]]. In the early months of 2009, Rourke, Rockwell, and Johansson filled out the supporting cast, and filming took place from April to July of that year. Like its predecessor, the film was shot mostly in [[California]], except for a key sequence in [[Monaco]].\n\n''Iron Man 2'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on April 26, 2010, and was released in the United States on May 7, 2010. The film received generally positive reviews, with praise for Downey's performance as well as for the action sequences, musical score and visual effects. However, the film received criticism for its villain and pacing, with many critics deeming the film inferior to the original. The film was commercially successful, grossing over $623.9 million at the worldwide box office, making it the [[2010 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of 2010]], and receiving an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]. The third and final installment of the ''Iron Man'' series, ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', was released on May 3, 2013.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nIn Russia, the media covers [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]], whose father, [[Crimson Dynamo#Anton Vanko|Anton Vanko]], has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film also take place simultaneously with the events of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' and ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" />}} Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father [[Howard Stark|Howard]]'s legacy.\n\nLater, Stark learns that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps him alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant [[Pepper Potts]] as CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]], where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, wielding electrified whips. Stark dons his armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer]], fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Iron Man suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, [[U.S. Air Force]] Lieutenant Colonel [[War Machine|James Rhodes]], dons Stark's prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, and Rhodes confiscates the armor for the U.S. Air Force.\n\n[[Nick Fury]], director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], approaches Stark, revealing that \"Rushman\" is Agent [[Natasha Romanoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Natasha Romanoff]] and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father and Stark invented the arc reactor together, but when Anton tried to sell it, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the Gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material. Tony discovers a hidden message in the [[diorama]] of the 1974 Stark Expo; it proves to be a diagram of the atomic structure of a new element. With the aid of his A.I., [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark synthesizes it. When he learns that Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency.\n\nAt the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the prototype armor. Stark arrives to warn Rhodes, but Vanko takes remote control of all the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Stark. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of Rhodes' armor to him. Together, Stark and Rhodes defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko commits [[suicide]] by blowing up his suit, along with the defeated drones.\n\nAt a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of his difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. In a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]] reports the discovery of [[Mjolnir (comics)|a large hammer]] at the bottom of a crater in a desert in New Mexico.{{refn|name=Thor|group=N|As depicted in the 2011 film ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 150\n| footer = Downey, Johansson and Rockwell promoting the film at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International\n| image1 = Robert Downey Jr SDCC 2009 3.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Scarlett Johansson SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| image3 = Sam Rockwell SDCC 2009 1.jpg\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = \n| align = \n| total_width = \n}}\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: <br />A billionaire who escaped captivity in [[Afghanistan]] with a suit of armor he created, he now struggles to keep his technology out of the government's hands.

After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including [[Mark Millar]], Stane became the main villain in ''Iron Man''. Millar argued the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical.<ref name=\"MarkMillar\" /> Favreau concurred, deciding, \"I look at Mandarin more like how in ''[[Star Wars]]'' you had the [[Palpatine|Emperor]], but [[Darth Vader]] is the guy you want to see fight. Then you work your way to the time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' happen in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]''. You just can't do it.\"<ref name=\"FavreauStarWars\" /> Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin \"allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains\".

He was also known as Sultan Jumaldin or Kaicili Mole.<ref>F.S.A. de Clercq (1890) ''Bijdragen tot de kennis der Residentie Ternate''.

London, p. 97-8.</ref> His uncle [[Gapi Baguna]] then ruled Tidore during several decades, marked by a strategical alliance with the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]]. In that way Tidore was able to hold its own against the powerful Ternate. The strong Iberian fortress on [[Tidore Island]], Los Reys Magos, deterred Ternatan attacks while the rest of Maluku and parts of [[Sulawesi]] fell under Ternate's might. When Gapi Baguna passed away in April 1599 a succession crisis occurred. Two candidates for the throne were brought forward by Ternate but were killed in succession.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1980) ''Documenta Malucensia'', Vol II. Rome: Jesuit Historical Institute, p. 10.</ref> A half-brother of Mole called Kaicili Kota was considered the legitimate heir to his uncle since he was born from Gava's main consort or ''Putri''. However, he had leanings towards Ternate and Mole was therefore enthroned. According to Argensola he was bent on revenge against Ternate because of his father's violent death.<ref>Bartholomew Leonardo de Argensola (1708) ''The discovery and conquest of the Molucco and Philippine Islands''.

Three years later the Dutch East India Company was constituted, whose efficiency the Spanish could hardly match. An expedition equipped in the [[Spanish Philippines]] sailed down to Maluku in 1603 and tried to invest Ternate. The siege was a complete failure, and the Spanish accused Sultan Mole of betraying his allies.<ref>Willard A. Hanna & Des Alwi (1990) ''Turbulent times past in Ternate and Tidore''. Banda Naira: Yayasan Warisan dan Budaya Banda Naira, p. 126.</ref> Allying with Sultan [[Saidi Berkat]] of Ternate, the Dutch in turn attacked and captured Fort Los Reys Magos in 1605, after having first conquered the important center of clove cultivation [[Ambon Island|Ambon]]. At this time Tidore was considered the third largest producer of cloves with 900 [[Bahar (unit)|Bahar]] (c. 245,8 metric tons) per year, and therefore held considerable economic importance in the region.<ref>Peter Borschberg (2015) ''Journals, memorials and letters of Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge''. Singapore: NUS Press, p. 584.</ref> \n\nThe loss of Maluku immediately alerted the Spanish governor [[Pedro Bravo de Acu\u00f1a]] who dispatched a new fleet in 1606. This time the Spaniards were entirely successful. Mole contributed with a fleet of korakoras (outriggers) manned with 600 men and a successful landing was made on Ternate. Sultan Saidi Berkat was forced to capitulate, while the Spanish groomed Mole and \"made this king, who had always been our friend, emperor of those islands\"<ref>Peter Borschberg (2015), p. 82.</ref> Mole took over or received back a number of territories previously held by Ternate, such as parts of [[Makian]], Mayu island, and a section of [[Morotai]].<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993) ''The world of Maluku''. Honolulu: Hawai'i University Press, p. 142.</ref>\n\n==The VOC returns==\n\nIn fact the new Spanish-Tidorese hegemony was of short duration. Already in 1607 a Dutch fleet appeared in [[North Maluku]] and made a treaty with the new Sultan of Ternate. A fort was constructed in Ternate so that the island was divided into a Spanish and a VOC-allied sphere. In 1613 the allies joined forces to invade Tidore in order to push out the Spanish, strengthened by [[Japanese people|Japanese]] mercenaries. The Ternatan Sultan explicitly told the Dutch of his intention to capture Mole and finishing him off with a sword. The VOC forces quickly overwhelmed the Spanish fort after a tenacious battle where the wounded Spaniards were disposed of ''per el filo de l'espada''. Mole preferred not to intervene in the fight, but the allies proceeded to attack the royal settlement. However, they were now in turn defeated by a determined Tidorese troop armed with muskets, shields and swords and had to withdraw.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1886) ''Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel'', Vol. I. 's Gravenhage: Nijhoff, p. 28-35.</ref> In the next year 1614, the allies struck again and two more Spanish fortresses in Tidore were captured. However, the Iberians could not be expelled from Tidore, nor from their main fort Gamalama in Ternate.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 154.</ref>\n\nThe inconclusive results of the invasions made for an uneasy balance between Tidore and Ternate and their respective European allies that lasted for several decades. The VOC constantly admonished the Ternatan allies to keep pressure on the Tidorese and was keen to prevent attempts by the two spice Sultanates to make peace.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1886), p. 350.</ref> In that way the traditional rivalry between Tidore and Ternate became a war by proxy where the two were treated as pawns in a global game for power.<ref>Leonard Andaya (1993), p. 156.</ref> In this the VOC became increasingly dominant in Maluku as they defeated [[English people|English]] attempts to establish bases in the region, as well as recalcitrant indigenous polities.<ref>Adam Clulow (2019) ''Amboina, 1623: Fear and conspiracy on the edge of empire''. New York: Columbia University Press.</ref> \n\nAlthough he hang on to his vassalage to the Spanish king and was said to be a friend of the Portuguese, Mole himself was not entirely appreciated by the Spanish authorities in [[Manila]]. As an author had it, \"his respect is fear and his love is selfishness\". When anti-Spanish resistance broke out in [[Jailolo]] in [[Halmahera]] in the wake of the Spanish conquest, he reportedly made various excuses and pretexts to abstain from intervening.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1981) The 'Discurso politico del gobierno Maluco' of Fr. Francisco Comb\u00e9s and its historical impact\", ''Philippine Studies'' 29, p. 326-7.</ref> His policy of trying to conclude a separate peace with Ternate indicates that the Spanish alliance was more strategical than cordial.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1980), p. 9-10.</ref>\n\nFrom Mole's reign come the earliest explicite references to Tidore's authority in the lands of the [[Papuan people|Papuans]]. The [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] Sultanate had previously made claims to Papua, but by the early 17th century it had shrunk to insignificance. A Muslim cleric told a Dutch official in 1622 that \"the King of Tidore use to obtain gold from the Papuans\". While the rumours of gold might be exaggerated, this indicates that the Sultan already had interests in western [[New Guinea]] or [[Raja Ampat]].<ref>A. Haga (1884) ''Nederlandsch Nieuw Guinea en de Papoesche eilanden. Historische bijdrage, 1500-1883''. Batavia: Bruining, p. 35.[https://archive.org/details/nederlandschnie01wetegoog/page/n90/mode/2up]</ref>\n\n==Death==\n\nSultan Mole Majimu passed away in 1627. In spite of the official state of war, Ternate sent a customary burial gift, but the envoy was arrested since a Ternatan prince had recently attacked a ship sent by the King of [[Makassar]] to his Tidorese counterpart.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1890) ''Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel'', Vol. II. 's Gravenhage: Nijhoff, p. 124.</ref> By this time the royal clan had split into two competing lineages. His son [[Ngarolamo]] was reportedly accepted as heir more due to respect for Mole than for any affection on the part of the populace, since he regularly slept with other persons' wives. By contrast, his nephew Kaicili [[Gorontalo of Tidore|Gorontalo]] was a popular figure who stayed with the Sultan of Ternate and was considered the more legitimate heir.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1886), p. 139-40.</ref> As it was, Ngarolamo managed to secure the throne although he would loose it after a brief reign.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of rulers of Maluku]]\n* [[Spice trade]]\n* [[Tidore Sultanate]]\n* [[Sultanate of Ternate]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Gapi Baguna]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Sultan of Tidore|years=1599-1627}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Ngarolamo]]}}\n{{end}}\n\n[[Category:People from Maluku Islands]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox royalty\n|name  = Mole Majimu\n|succession  = Sultan of Tidore\n|reign       = 1599-1627\n|predecessor = [[Gapi Baguna]]\n|successor   = [[Ngarolamo]]\n|regnal name = \n|house       = \n|father      = \n|mother      = \n|birth_date  = \n|birth_place = \n|death_date  = 1627\n|religion    = [[Islam]]\n}}\n\n'''Mole Majimu''' (d. 1627) was the seventh Sultan of [[Tidore Sultanate|Tidore]] in [[Maluku Islands]], who reigned from 1599 to 1627.

When anti-Spanish resistance broke out in [[Jailolo]] in [[Halmahera]] in the wake of the Spanish conquest, he reportedly made various excuses and pretexts to abstain from intervening.<ref>Hubert Jacobs (1981) The 'Discurso politico del gobierno Maluco' of Fr.

The [[Bacan Islands|Bacan]] Sultanate had previously made claims to Papua, but by the early 17th century it had shrunk to insignificance. A Muslim cleric told a Dutch official in 1622 that \"the King of Tidore use to obtain gold from the Papuans\". While the rumours of gold might be exaggerated, this indicates that the Sultan already had interests in western [[New Guinea]] or [[Raja Ampat]].<ref>A.

In spite of the official state of war, Ternate sent a customary burial gift, but the envoy was arrested since a Ternatan prince had recently attacked a ship sent by the King of [[Makassar]] to his Tidorese counterpart.<ref>P.A. Tiele (1890) ''Bouwstoffen voor de geschiedenis der Nederlanders in den Maleischen Archipel'', Vol. II.

His son [[Ngarolamo]] was reportedly accepted as heir more due to respect for Mole than for any affection on the part of the populace, since he regularly slept with other persons' wives. By contrast, his nephew Kaicili [[Gorontalo of Tidore|Gorontalo]] was a popular figure who stayed with the Sultan of Ternate and was considered the more legitimate heir.<ref>P.A.

Johnson of Co. E, 11th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment. From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, [[Library of Congress]]]]\n\nThe '''11th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment''' was a [[Union army]] [[regiment]] that participated in the [[American Civil War]]. It had the distinction of being the oldest unit in continuous service from [[Pennsylvania]]. \n\n==History==\nThe 11th Pennsylvania was recruited from several counties in Pennsylvania as a three-month regiment on April 26, 1861, and sent to [[Camp Curtin]], [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] for training and organization. Phaon Jarrett served as its first colonel, with [[Richard Coulter (general)|Richard Coulter]] as lieutenant colonel and William D. Earnest as major. It was assigned to [[Robert Patterson]]'s [[Army of the Shenandoah (Union)|Army of the Shenandoah]]. The regiment received the nickname \"The Bloody Eleventh\" at the [[Battle of Falling Waters]], Virginia, July 2, 1861.\n\nThe 11th was reorganized as a three-year regiment in the August of the same year at [[Camp Curtin]] in Harrisburg. After a few weeks of drill, the regiment was given garrison duty at Annapolis, Maryland. In April, it was moved to Mannassas Junction, where it guarded the railroad. It was again transferred, this time to the Shenandoah Valley, in late May as part of [[Irvin McDowell]]'s Corps. They fought in the Battles of [[Battle of Cedar Mountain|Cedar Mountain]] and [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Bull Run]].\n\nAfter the Army of Virginia was merged into the [[Army of the Potomac]], the reconstituted regiment became part of the [[I Corps (ACW)|I Corps]]. At Turner's Gap at the [[Battle of South Mountain]], the 11th came under light fire only, losing two men wounded. At the [[Battle of Antietam]] three days later, it was heavily engaged on the Union right around the West Woods. In this battle, it lost 27 killed, 89 wounded, and two captured.\n\nWhen the original three-year enlistment period expired in January 1864, many of the men re-enrolled in the regiment at the influence of Brig. Gen. Richard Coulter, a former colonel of the regiment. Because of this, the unit was designated \"veteran volunteers.\" During the reorganization of the Army in the spring of 1864, the 11th became part of the [[V Corps (ACW)|V Corps]], as the old I Corps had been disbanded, and surviving units transferred to the V Corps.\n\nThe 11th fought in multiple battles in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], including [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Bull Run]], [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant's]] [[Overland Campaign]], the [[Siege of Petersburg]], and the [[Appomattox Campaign]]. It was mustered out on July 1, 1865. [[File:11TH PVI.jpg|thumb|Monument to the 11th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment at the Battle of Gettysburg. It is located off Doubleday Avenue on Oak Ridge in the Gettysburg National Military Park, Gettysburg, PA, USA. The location is near the right flank of the First Corps on July 1, 1863. Note the inclusion of the regimental mascot, Sallie (see info at left).]]\n\nA total of 1,890 men served in the regiment during the war, and only 340 men were discharged at war's end. \n\nAmong the numerous casualties was one that would stand out as an undying remembrance of the unit and its loyalty to the cause. The regiment's beloved mascot, [[Sallie Ann Jarrett (dog)|Sallie Ann Jarrett]], \"a brindle, bull-terrier\"<ref>Bates, Samuel P., \"Martial Deeds of Pennsylvania,\" 1875, p. 1103</ref> similar to today's [[American Staffordshire Terrier]], traveled everywhere with the unit. \"Sallie\" was said to have hated three things &mdash; Rebels, Democrats, and Women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.11thpvi.org/Sallie.htm|title=Sallie|website=www.11thpvi.org}}</ref> Her loyalty was undying, for at Gettysburg, after the battle on the [[Battle of Gettysburg, First Day|First Day]] was over, Sallie, tired and hungry, ambled out to where her brave comrades had fought and died. She lay down with the dead, until she was found, weak and close to death herself, on July 4, 1863.  Her friends nursed her back to health, and she fought with the unit in every battle until she was mortally wounded at [[Battle of Hatcher's Run|Hatcher's Run]] in February 1865. Although under a \"murderous fire,\"<ref>Bates, Samuel P., \"Martial Deeds of Pennsylvania,\" p. 1103</ref> several of the men gave her a proper burial where she fell. Never forgetting the most devoted member of their regiment, in 1890 the veterans of the 11th forever memorialized her by placing her bronze likeness on their monument on Oak Ridge in the [[Gettysburg Battlefield|Gettysburg National Military Park]].\n\nCasualties:\n* Killed and mortally wounded: 12 officers, 224 enlisted men\n* Wounded: ? officers, ? enlisted men\n* Died of disease: 4 officers, 177 enlisted men\n* Captured or missing: ? officers, ? enlisted men\n* Total casualties: ? officers, ? enlisted men\n\n== Notable members ==\nThe 11th Pennsylvania was commanded for most of its service by Colonel [[Richard Coulter (general)|Richard Coulter]].\n\nTwo of the regiment's men were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]], both for capturing battle flags. Private [[George W. Reed]] earned his at the [[Battle of Globe Tavern]] on August 21, 1864, and Sergeant [[Hiram H. De Lavie]] at the [[Battle of Five Forks]] on April 1, 1865.<ref name=\"moh1\"/><ref name=\"moh2\"/>\n\n[[William Henry Locke]], the regimental chaplain, later wrote a history of the 11th Pennsylvania.\n\n==Reenactors==\nCompany K, 11th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, is based in southwest Pennsylvania.

Because of this, the unit was designated \"veteran volunteers.\" During the reorganization of the Army in the spring of 1864, the 11th became part of the [[V Corps (ACW)|V Corps]], as the old I Corps had been disbanded, and surviving units transferred to the V Corps.\n\nThe 11th fought in multiple battles in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], including [[Second Battle of Bull Run|Second Bull Run]], [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]], [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]], [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant's]] [[Overland Campaign]], the [[Siege of Petersburg]], and the [[Appomattox Campaign]]. It was mustered out on July 1, 1865. [[File:11TH PVI.jpg|thumb|Monument to the 11th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment at the Battle of Gettysburg. It is located off Doubleday Avenue on Oak Ridge in the Gettysburg National Military Park, Gettysburg, PA, USA. The location is near the right flank of the First Corps on July 1, 1863. Note the inclusion of the regimental mascot, Sallie (see info at left).]]\n\nA total of 1,890 men served in the regiment during the war, and only 340 men were discharged at war's end. \n\nAmong the numerous casualties was one that would stand out as an undying remembrance of the unit and its loyalty to the cause. The regiment's beloved mascot, [[Sallie Ann Jarrett (dog)|Sallie Ann Jarrett]], \"a brindle, bull-terrier\"<ref>Bates, Samuel P., \"Martial Deeds of Pennsylvania,\" 1875, p. 1103</ref> similar to today's [[American Staffordshire Terrier]], traveled everywhere with the unit. \"Sallie\" was said to have hated three things &mdash; Rebels, Democrats, and Women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.11thpvi.org/Sallie.htm|title=Sallie|website=www.11thpvi.org}}</ref> Her loyalty was undying, for at Gettysburg, after the battle on the [[Battle of Gettysburg, First Day|First Day]] was over, Sallie, tired and hungry, ambled out to where her brave comrades had fought and died. She lay down with the dead, until she was found, weak and close to death herself, on July 4, 1863.  Her friends nursed her back to health, and she fought with the unit in every battle until she was mortally wounded at [[Battle of Hatcher's Run|Hatcher's Run]] in February 1865. Although under a \"murderous fire,\"<ref>Bates, Samuel P., \"Martial Deeds of Pennsylvania,\" p. 1103</ref>several of the men gave her a proper burial where she fell. Never forgetting the most devoted member of their regiment, in 1890 the veterans of the 11th forever memorialized her by placing her bronze likeness on their monument on Oak Ridge in the [[Gettysburg Battlefield|Gettysburg National Military Park]].\n\nCasualties:\n* Killed and mortally wounded: 12 officers, 224 enlisted men\n* Wounded: ? officers, ? enlisted men\n* Died of disease: 4 officers, 177 enlisted men\n* Captured or missing: ? officers, ? enlisted men\n* Total casualties: ? officers, ? enlisted men\n\n== Notable members ==\nThe 11th Pennsylvania was commanded for most of its service by Colonel [[Richard Coulter (general)|Richard Coulter]].\n\nTwo of the regiment's men were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]], both for capturing battle flags. Private [[George W. Reed]] earned his at the [[Battle of Globe Tavern]] on August 21, 1864, and Sergeant [[Hiram H. De Lavie]] at the [[Battle of Five Forks]] on April 1, 1865.<ref name=\"moh1\"/><ref name=\"moh2\"/>\n\n[[William Henry Locke]], the regimental chaplain, later wrote a history of the 11th Pennsylvania.\n\n==Reenactors==\nCompany K, 11th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, is based in southwest Pennsylvania.
