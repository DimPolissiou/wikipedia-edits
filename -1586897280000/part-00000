The center leverages the insights of Fortune 100-company Centene Corporation and subsidiary Envolve on managed care, along with the research and evaluation expertise of the Brown School and Duke University to design, implement, and evaluate behavior-based innovations that facilitate healthier living. The Centene Center's research goals include improving the effectiveness and reach of health programs, serving as a model organization for translational research, training, implementation and dissemination, and contributing to the scientific evidence about what works in changing health behavior, improving health outcomes, and facilitating fuller lives for consumers.\n\nGrinstein-Weiss provides overall strategic, organizational, and scientific leadership for the Center along with the faculty directors and staff. She also serves as the faculty director in the Center's Washington University Behavioral Economics workgroup, using behavior-based strategies from the social sciences to shift the perspectives and environments in which people make decisions to improve participation, outcomes, and overall effectiveness of healthcare interventions.\n\n===Financial Behaviors and Inclusion===\nGrinstein-Weiss leads several financial behavior and inclusion initiatives. For example, she leads financial wellness programs (FWPs) research and initiatives. In recent years, the number of FWPs have increased significantly, yet they operate at a small scale, and evidence concerning their efficacy is limited. New, scalable models must be developed to reach and serve economically vulnerable populations. Employer-sponsored FWPs have the potential to reach low- to moderate-income households at a much larger scale than community-based programs and in a financially sustainable manner. Also, employer-sponsored FWPs are promising because of an existing stable infrastructure for delivery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://csd.wustl.edu/OurWork/FinIncl/financialbehavior/EmergeFinancial/Pages/Emerge-Financial-Wellness.aspx |title=Employee Financial Wellness Programs &#124; Center for Social Development &#124; Washington University in St. Louis |publisher=Csd.wustl.edu |date= |accessdate=2019-11-29}}</ref>\n\nGrinstein-Weiss also leads the Refund to Savings (R2S) Initiative, among other financial initiatives. R2S is the largest saving experiment conducted in the United States to date. R2S is a collaboration of academic researchers and tax industry experts from the Center for Social Development at Washington University in St. Louis, [[Duke University]], and [[Intuit]] Inc., the maker of [[TurboTax]] tax preparation software. R2S builds a saving-promotion experiment into the TurboTax Free File Online product that is available free to low- and moderate-income households. R2S experiments measure the effect of behavioral economics techniques using a randomized controlled trial with the goal of increasing savings at tax time. The tax refund is the largest check most households receive all year, and because it is outside of normal budgets and income, it may present a golden moment to increase families\u2019 financial security.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://csd.wustl.edu/OurWork/FinIncl/financialbehavior/R2S/Pages/Refund-to-Savings1.aspx |title=Areas of Work &#124; Center for Social Development &#124; Washington University in St. Louis |publisher=Csd.wustl.edu |date= |accessdate=2019-11-29}}</ref>\n\n===Dissemination efforts===\nHer research crosses disciplines, informing policy makers, scholars in diverse fields, industry leaders, and practitioners.

He was influenced by native Mexican cultures. Of his six symphonies, the second, or ''[[Sinfon\u00eda india]]'', which uses native [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] percussion instruments, is probably the most popular.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Conservatorio Nacional de M\u00fasica de M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|257px|left|National Conservatory of Music. M\u00e9xico City]]\nThe seventh child of a creole family, Ch\u00e1vez was born on Tacuba Avenue in Mexico City, near the suburb of Popotla {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=11}}. His paternal grandfather, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ch\u00e1vez Alonso]], served as governor of the state of [[Aguascalientes]] and was executed on the orders of Emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico|Maximilian]] in 1864. His father, August\u00edn Ch\u00e1vez, who died when Carlos was barely three years old, invented a [[plough]] that was produced and used in the [[United States]].{{harv|Parker|1998|loc=3}}.\n\nCarlos had his first piano lessons from his brother Manuel, and later on he was taught piano by Asunci\u00f3n Parra, [[Manuel Ponce]], and Pedro Luis Ozag\u00f3n, and harmony by Juan Fuentes. His family often holidayed in [[Tlaxcala]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Oaxaca]], and other places where the cultural influence of the Mexican indigenous peoples was still very strong {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn 1916, Ch\u00e1vez and friends started a cultural journal, ''Gladios'', and this led to his joining the staff of the Mexico City newspaper {{lang|es|[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]}} in 1924. In the succeeding 36 years he was to write over 500 items for this paper ({{harvnb|Parker|2001}}; {{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=230\u201336}}).\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the installation of a democratically elected president, [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]], Ch\u00e1vez became one of the first exponents of Mexican nationalist music with ballets on [[Aztec]] themes {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn September 1922, Ch\u00e1vez married Otilia Ortiz and they went on honeymoon to Europe, from October 1922 until April 1923, spending two weeks in [[Vienna]], five months in Berlin, and eight or ten days in Paris {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=25\u201326}}. During the latter visit he met [[Paul Dukas]] {{harv|Parker|2001}}. Some months later, in December 1923, Ch\u00e1vez visited the United States for the first time, returning in March 1924 {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=26}}. Ch\u00e1vez again went to New York City in September 1926 and stayed there until June 1928 {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=40}}. Upon his return to Mexico, Ch\u00e1vez became director of the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica Mexicana (Mexican Symphonic Orchestra), later renamed Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico (Mexico's Symphonic Orchestra); the country's first permanent orchestra, started by a musicians' [[labor union]]. Ch\u00e1vez was instrumental in taking the orchestra on tour through Mexico's rural areas.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nIn December 1928, Ch\u00e1vez was appointed director of Mexico's National Conservatory of Music\u2014a position he held for a total of five years (until March 1933, and again for eight months in 1934). In that capacity, Ch\u00e1vez spearheaded three ''academias de investigaci\u00f3n'', two concerned with collecting and cataloguing indigenous music and its literature, and the third to study the uses of old and new scales {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn 1937, Ch\u00e1vez published a book, ''Toward a New Music'', which is one of the first books in which a composer speaks about [[electronic music]]. In 1938, he conducted a series of concerts with the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], during a period of absence by the orchestra's regular conductor, [[Arturo Toscanini]]. In 1940 he produced concerts at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], and by 1945, Ch\u00e1vez had come to be regarded as the foremost Mexican composer and conductor {{harv|Slonimsky|1945|loc=230\u201331}}.\n\nFrom January 1947 until 1952, Ch\u00e1vez served as director-general of the [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes|National Institute of Fine Arts]]. In his first year, he formed the [[National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico)|National Symphony Orchestra]], which supplanted the older OSM as Mexico's premier orchestra and led to the disbanding of the older ensemble. Throughout all this time, Ch\u00e1vez maintained a busy international touring schedule {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n[[File:CarlosChaveztombDoloresDF.JPG|thumb|200px|Carlos Ch\u00e1vez's tomb in the [[Pante\u00f3n de Dolores]], Mexico City]]\n\nIn May 1953 he was commissioned by [[Lincoln Kirstein]], director of the New York City center of Music and Drama, for a three-act opera to a libretto by [[Chester Kallman]] based on a story by [[Boccaccio]], to be titled ''The Tuscan Players''. Intended to be finished in August 1954, it was first postponed to April 1955, but only finally completed in 1956, by which time the title had been changed twice, first to ''P\u00e1nfilo and Lauretta'', then to {{lang|es|El amor propiciado}}. The City Center waived its rights to the first performance, which was given under the title ''Panfilo and Lauretta'' in the Brander Matthews Theatre at [[Columbia University]] in New York on May 9, 1957, under the baton of [[Howard Shanet]]. Stage direction was by Bill Butler, scenic design by Herbert Senn and Helen Pond, and costumes by Sylvia Wintle. The principal singers were [[Sylvia Stahlman]], Frank Porretta, [[Craig Timberlake]], Mary McMurray, Michael Kermoyan, and [[Thomas Stewart (bass-baritone)|Thomas Stewart]] {{harv|Taubman|1957}}. The opera would be revised twice more and the title changed again to {{lang|es|Los visitantes}} (''[[The Visitors (opera)|The Visitors]]''), for productions in 1968 and 1973, in Mexico City and [[Aptos, California]], respectively ({{harvnb|Parker|2001}}; {{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=171}}). From 1958\u20131959 he was the Charles Eliot Norton professor at [[Harvard University]], and the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|public lectures]] he gave there were published as a book, ''Musical Thought'' {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961}}.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973, Carlos Ch\u00e1vez served as the music director of the [[Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music]]. His orchestral composition ''Discovery'' (1969) had previously been commission by the Festival and was first performed there.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nFailing health and financial setbacks forced Ch\u00e1vez to sell his house{{when|date=June 2012}} in the [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] neighborhood of Mexico City and move in with his daughter Anita in [[Coyoac\u00e1n]], in the fringes of the Mexican capital, where he died quietly on 2 August 1978 {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nCarlos Ch\u00e1vez's manuscripts and papers are housed in the Music Division of the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]] and in the [[General National Archive (Mexico)|National Archive of Mexico]], in Mexico City.\n\n==Musical style==\nCh\u00e1vez's music does not fall into clear stylistic periods, but rather cumulates elements in a process of continual synthesis. The [[juvenilia]], up to 1921 and consisting primarily of piano compositions, is essentially [[Romantic music|Romantic]], with [[Robert Schumann]] as the main influence. A period of nationalistic leanings was initiated in 1921 with the [[Aztec]]-themed ballet {{lang|es|El fuego nuevo}} (The New Fire), followed by a second ballet, {{lang|es|Los cuatro soles}} (The Four Suns), in 1925 {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nDuring his time in New York City between 1924 and 1928, Ch\u00e1vez acquired a taste for the then-fashionable abstract and quasi-scientific music, as is reflected in the titles of many of his compositions written between 1923 and 1934: {{lang|es|Pol\u00edgonos}} for piano (Polygons, 1923), {{lang|es|Ex\u00e1gonos}} for voice and piano (Hexagons, 1924), ''36'' for piano (1925), {{lang|es|Energ\u00eda}} for nine instruments (Energy, 1925), {{lang|es|Espiral}} for violin and piano (Spiral, 1934), and an unfinished orchestral score titled {{lang|es|Pir\u00e1mides}} (Pyramids).\n\nThe culmination of this period was the ballet ''[[Caballos de vapor|H. P.]]'' (i.e., Horse Power), also known by the Spanish title {{lang|es|Caballos de vapor}} (1926\u201331) {{harv|Slonimsky|1945|loc=231}}. ''H. P.'' is a colorfully orchestrated score of ample dimensions and dense, compact atmosphere, notable for its dynamism and vitality, revealing the influence of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and at the same time returning to folkloric and popular elements, with dances such as the [[sandunga]], [[tango (dance)|tango]], [[huapango]], and [[foxtrot]] {{harv|Garcia_Morillo|1960|loc=49\u201351}}. Such nationalisms would appear through the 1930s, notably in the Second Symphony (the {{lang|es|Sinfon\u00eda \u00edndia}} of 1935\u201336, one of the few works by Ch\u00e1vez to quote actual Native-American themes), but only sporadically in later compositions {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nAlthough this early period saw the creation of the Sonatina for violin and piano (1924), it was only in the 1930s that Ch\u00e1vez returned to another of the main musical interests of his maturity, prefigured in the juvenilia: the traditional genres of the [[sonata]], [[String quartet|quartet]], [[symphony]], and [[concerto]] {{harv|Parker|2001}}. He composed six numbered symphonies. The first, titled {{lang|es|[[Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona]]}} (1933), was reworked from incidental music for [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''Antigone'', an adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' tragedy. In it, Ch\u00e1vez sought to create an archaic ambiance through the use of modal polyphony, harmonies built on fourths and fifths, and a predominant use of wind instruments {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn the fourth of his Norton lectures of 1958\u201359, titled \"Repetition in Music\" {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961|loc=55\u201384}}, he described a mode of composition already observable in many of his compositions since the 1920s, in which \"The idea of repetition and variation can be replaced by the notion of constant rebirth, of true derivation: a stream that never comes back to its source; a stream in eternal development, like a spiral&nbsp;\u2026\" {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961|loc=84}}. A notable early example of this method is ''Soli I'' (1933), the first work acknowledged by the composer to have been consciously organized according to this principle. It only became a regular feature, however, beginning with ''Invenci\u00f3n I'' for piano (1958), and subsequently in most of his instrumental compositions of the 1960s and 1970s: ''Invenci\u00f3n II'' for string trio (1965), ''Invenci\u00f3n III'' for harp (1967), ''Soli II'' for wind quintet (1961), ''Soli III'' for bassoon, trumpet, viola, timpani, and orchestra (1969), ''Soli IV'' for brass trio (1966), ''Cinco Caprichos'' for piano (1975), and the late orchestral works ''Resonancias'' (1964), ''Elatio'' (1967), ''Discovery'' (1969), ''Clio'' (1969), and ''Initium'' (1970\u201372) {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=41, 47, 98\u2013103, 123\u201324}}.\n\n==Recordings==\n\nCh\u00e1vez made more than a handful of recordings, conducting his own music as well as that of other composers. One of the earliest was made in the 1930s for Victor, containing Ch\u00e1vez's ''Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona'' and ''Sinfon\u00eda india'', together with his orchestration of [[Dietrich Buxtehude]]'s Chaconne in E minor: 4-disc 78-rpm set, Victor Musical Masterpiece Series, Victor Red Seal M 503 (manual sequence) and DM 503 (automatic sequence). The best-known{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} of his discs was the [[Everest Records]] stereophonic recording of his ''Sinfon\u00eda India'', ''Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona'', and ''Sinfon\u00eda Rom\u00e1ntica'', in which Ch\u00e1vez conducted the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra|Stadium Symphony Orchestra]], the name given to the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] for its summer performances in the [[Lewisohn Stadium]]. The album was originally issued in 1959 by [[Everest Records]] on LP SDBR 3029, and was reissued on CD in 1996 by Everest as EVC-9041, as well as at some point by [[Philips Records]]. In 1963 Ch\u00e1vez conducted the [[Vienna State Opera|Vienna State Opera Orchestra]] in two recordings with pianist [[Eugene List]] for [[Westminster Records]], both released on LP: one of his own Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (Westminster WST 17030, reissued in 1976 as Westminster Gold WGS 8324) and one of the two piano concertos by [[Edward Macdowell]] (ABC Westminster Gold WGS 8156). In the 1950s he released two recordings on US Decca records, on which he conducted the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico. In 1951 a 10-inch mono LP was issued (Decca Gold Label DL 7512, reissued 1978 by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] on side 2 of 12-inch LP ), containing his Suite from ''[[La hija de C\u00f3lquide]]'' (originally recorded in 1947 for the Mexican label Anfi\u00f3n and issued as a 3-disc 78 rpm set Anfi\u00f3n AM 4), and in 1956 they released an anthology, ''Music of Mexico'', on which he conducted three of his own works, plus [[Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo]]'s ''Huapango'' (Decca Gold Label LP, DL9527). He also made some recordings for [[Columbia Records]] which were issued on 78-rpm discs and on LP (Columbia 4-disc 78-rpm set M 414, reissued 1949 on Columbia 10-inch LP, Columbia ML 2080 and Mexican Columbia DCL 98, reissued on Columbia 12-inch LP, LL 1015; CBS Masterworks 3-LP set 32 31 0001 (mono)/ 32 31 002 (stereo); CBC Masterworks LP 32 11 0064; Columbia LP M32685; Odyssey LP Y 31534).

He was influenced by native Mexican cultures. Of his six symphonies, the second, or ''[[Sinfon\u00eda india]]'', which uses native [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] percussion instruments, is probably the most popular.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Conservatorio Nacional de M\u00fasica de M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|257px|left|National Conservatory of Music. M\u00e9xico City]]\nThe seventh child of a creole family, Ch\u00e1vez was born on Tacuba Avenue in Mexico City, near the suburb of Popotla {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=11}}. His paternal grandfather, [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ch\u00e1vez Alonso]], served as governor of the state of [[Aguascalientes]] and was executed on the orders of Emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico|Maximilian]] in 1864. His father, August\u00edn Ch\u00e1vez, who died when Carlos was barely three years old, invented a [[plough]] that was produced and used in the [[United States]].{{harv|Parker|1998|loc=3}}.\n\nCarlos had his first piano lessons from his brother Manuel, and later on he was taught piano by Asunci\u00f3n Parra, [[Manuel Ponce]], and Pedro Luis Ozag\u00f3n, and harmony by Juan Fuentes. His family often holidayed in [[Tlaxcala]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Oaxaca]], and other places where the cultural influence of the Mexican indigenous peoples was still very strong {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn 1916, Ch\u00e1vez and friends started a cultural journal, ''Gladios'', and this led to his joining the staff of the Mexico City newspaper {{lang|es|[[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]]}} in 1924. In the succeeding 36 years he was to write over 500 items for this paper ({{harvnb|Parker|2001}}; {{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=230\u201336}}).\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the installation of a democratically elected president, [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]], Ch\u00e1vez became one of the first exponents of Mexican nationalist music with ballets on [[Aztec]] themes {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn September 1922, Ch\u00e1vez married Otilia Ortiz and they went on honeymoon to Europe, from October 1922 until April 1923, spending two weeks in [[Vienna]], five months in Berlin, and eight or ten days in Paris {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=25\u201326}}. During the latter visit he met [[Paul Dukas]] {{harv|Parker|2001}}. Some months later, in December 1923, Ch\u00e1vez visited the United States for the first time, returning in March 1924 {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=26}}. Ch\u00e1vez again went to New York City in September 1926 and stayed there until June 1928 {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=40}}. Upon his return to Mexico, Ch\u00e1vez became director of the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica Mexicana (Mexican Symphonic Orchestra), later renamed Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico (Mexico's Symphonic Orchestra); the country's first permanent orchestra, started by a musicians' [[labor union]]. Ch\u00e1vez was instrumental in taking the orchestra on tour through Mexico's rural areas.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nIn December 1928, Ch\u00e1vez was appointed director of Mexico's National Conservatory of Music\u2014a position he held for a total of five years (until March 1933, and again for eight months in 1934). In that capacity, Ch\u00e1vez spearheaded three ''academias de investigaci\u00f3n'', two concerned with collecting and cataloguing indigenous music and its literature, and the third to study the uses of old and new scales {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn 1937, Ch\u00e1vez published a book, ''Toward a New Music'', which is one of the first books in which a composer speaks about [[electronic music]]. In 1938, he conducted a series of concerts with the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]], during a period of absence by the orchestra's regular conductor, [[Arturo Toscanini]]. In 1940 he produced concerts at New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], and by 1945, Ch\u00e1vez had come to be regarded as the foremost Mexican composer and conductor {{harv|Slonimsky|1945|loc=230\u201331}}.\n\nFrom January 1947 until 1952, Ch\u00e1vez served as director-general of the [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes|National Institute of Fine Arts]]. In his first year, he formed the [[National Symphony Orchestra (Mexico)|National Symphony Orchestra]], which supplanted the older OSM as Mexico's premier orchestra and led to the disbanding of the older ensemble. Throughout all this time, Ch\u00e1vez maintained a busy international touring schedule {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n[[File:CarlosChaveztombDoloresDF.JPG|thumb|200px|Carlos Ch\u00e1vez's tomb in the [[Pante\u00f3n de Dolores]], Mexico City]]\n\nIn May 1953 he was commissioned by [[Lincoln Kirstein]], director of the New York City center of Music and Drama, for a three-act opera to a libretto by [[Chester Kallman]] based on a story by [[Boccaccio]], to be titled ''The Tuscan Players''. Intended to be finished in August 1954, it was first postponed to April 1955, but only finally completed in 1956, by which time the title had been changed twice, first to ''P\u00e1nfilo and Lauretta'', then to {{lang|es|El amor propiciado}}. The City Center waived its rights to the first performance, which was given under the title ''Panfilo and Lauretta'' in the Brander Matthews Theatre at [[Columbia University]] in New York on May 9, 1957, under the baton of [[Howard Shanet]]. Stage direction was by Bill Butler, scenic design by Herbert Senn and Helen Pond, and costumes by Sylvia Wintle. The principal singers were [[Sylvia Stahlman]], Frank Porretta, [[Craig Timberlake]], Mary McMurray, Michael Kermoyan, and [[Thomas Stewart (bass-baritone)|Thomas Stewart]] {{harv|Taubman|1957}}. The opera would be revised twice more and the title changed again to {{lang|es|Los visitantes}} (''[[The Visitors (opera)|The Visitors]]''), for productions in 1968 and 1973, in Mexico City and [[Aptos, California]], respectively ({{harvnb|Parker|2001}}; {{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=171}}). From 1958\u20131959 he was the Charles Eliot Norton professor at [[Harvard University]], and the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|public lectures]] he gave there were published as a book, ''Musical Thought'' {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961}}.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973, Carlos Ch\u00e1vez served as the music director of the [[Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music]]. His orchestral composition ''Discovery'' (1969) had previously been commission by the Festival and was first performed there.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nFailing health and financial setbacks forced Ch\u00e1vez to sell his house{{when|date=June 2012}} in the [[Lomas de Chapultepec]] neighborhood of Mexico City and move in with his daughter Anita in [[Coyoac\u00e1n]], in the fringes of the Mexican capital, where he died quietly on 2 August 1978 {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nCarlos Ch\u00e1vez's manuscripts and papers are housed in the Music Division of the [[New York Public Library for the Performing Arts]] and in the [[General National Archive (Mexico)|National Archive of Mexico]], in Mexico City.\n\n==Musical style==\nCh\u00e1vez's music does not fall into clear stylistic periods, but rather cumulates elements in a process of continual synthesis. The [[juvenilia]], up to 1921 and consisting primarily of piano compositions, is essentially [[Romantic music|Romantic]], with [[Robert Schumann]] as the main influence. A period of nationalistic leanings was initiated in 1921 with the [[Aztec]]-themed ballet {{lang|es|El fuego nuevo}} (The New Fire), followed by a second ballet, {{lang|es|Los cuatro soles}} (The Four Suns), in 1925 {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nDuring his time in New York City between 1924 and 1928, Ch\u00e1vez acquired a taste for the then-fashionable abstract and quasi-scientific music, as is reflected in the titles of many of his compositions written between 1923 and 1934: {{lang|es|Pol\u00edgonos}} for piano (Polygons, 1923), {{lang|es|Ex\u00e1gonos}} for voice and piano (Hexagons, 1924), ''36'' for piano (1925), {{lang|es|Energ\u00eda}} for nine instruments (Energy, 1925), {{lang|es|Espiral}} for violin and piano (Spiral, 1934), and an unfinished orchestral score titled {{lang|es|Pir\u00e1mides}} (Pyramids).\n\nThe culmination of this period was the ballet ''[[Caballos de vapor|H. P.]]'' (i.e., Horse Power), also known by the Spanish title {{lang|es|Caballos de vapor}} (1926\u201331) {{harv|Slonimsky|1945|loc=231}}. ''H. P.'' is a colorfully orchestrated score of ample dimensions and dense, compact atmosphere, notable for its dynamism and vitality, revealing the influence of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] and at the same time returning to folkloric and popular elements, with dances such as the [[sandunga]], [[tango (dance)|tango]], [[huapango]], and [[foxtrot]] {{harv|Garcia_Morillo|1960|loc=49\u201351}}. Such nationalisms would appear through the 1930s, notably in the Second Symphony (the {{lang|es|Sinfon\u00eda \u00edndia}} of 1935\u201336, one of the few works by Ch\u00e1vez to quote actual Native-American themes), but only sporadically in later compositions {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nAlthough this early period saw the creation of the Sonatina for violin and piano (1924), it was only in the 1930s that Ch\u00e1vez returned to another of the main musical interests of his maturity, prefigured in the juvenilia: the traditional genres of the [[sonata]], [[String quartet|quartet]], [[symphony]], and [[concerto]] {{harv|Parker|2001}}. He composed six numbered symphonies. The first, titled {{lang|es|[[Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona]]}} (1933), was reworked from incidental music for [[Jean Cocteau]]'s ''Antigone'', an adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' tragedy. In it, Ch\u00e1vez sought to create an archaic ambiance through the use of modal polyphony, harmonies built on fourths and fifths, and a predominant use of wind instruments {{harv|Parker|2001}}.\n\nIn the fourth of his Norton lectures of 1958\u201359, titled \"Repetition in Music\" {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961|loc=55\u201384}}, he described a mode of composition already observable in many of his compositions since the 1920s, in which \"The idea of repetition and variation can be replaced by the notion of constant rebirth, of true derivation: a stream that never comes back to its source; a stream in eternal development, like a spiral&nbsp;\u2026\" {{harv|Ch\u00e1vez|1961|loc=84}}. A notable early example of this method is ''Soli I'' (1933), the first work acknowledged by the composer to have been consciously organized according to this principle. It only became a regular feature, however, beginning with ''Invenci\u00f3n I'' for piano (1958), and subsequently in most of his instrumental compositions of the 1960s and 1970s: ''Invenci\u00f3n II'' for string trio (1965), ''Invenci\u00f3n III'' for harp (1967), ''Soli II'' for wind quintet (1961), ''Soli III'' for bassoon, trumpet, viola, timpani, and orchestra (1969), ''Soli IV'' for brass trio (1966), ''Cinco Caprichos'' for piano (1975), and the late orchestral works ''Resonancias'' (1964), ''Elatio'' (1967), ''Discovery'' (1969), ''Clio'' (1969), and ''Initium'' (1970\u201372) {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=41, 47, 98\u2013103, 123\u201324}}.\n\n==Recordings==\n\nCh\u00e1vez made more than a handful of recordings, conducting his own music as well as that of other composers. One of the earliest was made in the 1930s for Victor, containing Ch\u00e1vez's ''Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona'' and ''Sinfon\u00eda india'', together with his orchestration of [[Dietrich Buxtehude]]'s Chaconne in E minor: 4-disc 78-rpm set, Victor Musical Masterpiece Series, Victor Red Seal M 503 (manual sequence) and DM 503 (automatic sequence). The best-known{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} of his discs was the [[Everest Records]] stereophonic recording of his ''Sinfon\u00eda India'', ''Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona'', and ''Sinfon\u00eda Rom\u00e1ntica'', in which Ch\u00e1vez conducted the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra|Stadium Symphony Orchestra]], the name given to the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] for its summer performances in the [[Lewisohn Stadium]]. The album was originally issued in 1959 by [[Everest Records]] on LP SDBR 3029, and was reissued on CD in 1996 by Everest as EVC-9041, as well as at some point by [[Philips Records]]. In 1963 Ch\u00e1vez conducted the [[Vienna State Opera|Vienna State Opera Orchestra]] in two recordings with pianist [[Eugene List]] for [[Westminster Records]], both released on LP: one of his own Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (Westminster WST 17030, reissued in 1976 as Westminster Gold WGS 8324) and one of the two piano concertos by [[Edward Macdowell]] (ABC Westminster Gold WGS 8156). In the 1950s he released two recordings on US Decca records, on which he conducted the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico. In 1951 a 10-inch mono LP was issued (Decca Gold Label DL 7512, reissued 1978 by [[Var\u00e8se Sarabande]] on side 2 of 12-inch LP ), containing his Suite from ''[[La hija de C\u00f3lquide]]'' (originally recorded in 1947 for the Mexican label Anfi\u00f3n and issued as a 3-disc 78 rpm set Anfi\u00f3n AM 4), and in 1956 they released an anthology, ''Music of Mexico'', on which he conducted three of his own works, plus [[Jos\u00e9 Pablo Moncayo]]'s ''Huapango'' (Decca Gold Label LP, DL9527). He also made some recordings for [[Columbia Records]] which were issued on 78-rpm discs and on LP (Columbia 4-disc 78-rpm set M 414, reissued 1949 on Columbia 10-inch LP, Columbia ML 2080 and Mexican Columbia DCL 98, reissued on Columbia 12-inch LP, LL 1015; CBS Masterworks 3-LP set 32 31 0001 (mono)/ 32 31 002 (stereo); CBC Masterworks LP 32 11 0064; Columbia LP M32685; Odyssey LP Y 31534). In 1961 he recorded [[Sergey Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', with the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de M\u00e9xico and [[Carlos Pellicer]], narrator, released on Mexican CBS MC 1360.\n\n== List of works ==\n{{main|List of compositions by Carlos Ch\u00e1vez}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Daniel Ayala P\u00e9rez]]\n* [[Aaron Copland]]\n* [[Blas Galindo]]\n* [[Grupo de los cuatro]]\n* [[Silvestre Revueltas]]\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Ch\u00e1vez|1937}}|reference=Ch\u00e1vez, Carlos. 1937.
