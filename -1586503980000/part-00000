Fourth Movement]] in 1919, after which it was replaced by [[Written Vernacular Chinese]].\nThis new form was based on the vocabulary and grammar of modern [[Mandarin dialects]], particularly the [[Beijing dialect]], and is the written form of [[Modern Standard Chinese]].\nLiterary Chinese persisted for a time in journalism and government, but was replaced there too in the late 1940s.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=247}}\n\n[[Buddhism]] reached China from central Asia in the first century AD, and over the following centuries the Buddhist scriptures were translated into Literary Chinese.\nBuddhist missionaries then spread these texts throughout East Asia, and students of the new religion learned the language of these sacred texts.{{sfnp|Miller|1967|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nThroughout East Asia, Literary Chinese was the language of administration and scholarship.\nAlthough Vietnam, Korea and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, these were limited to popular literature.\nChinese remained the medium of formal writing until it was displaced by vernacular writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|pp=66\u201367}}\nThough they did not use Chinese for spoken communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]], which provide clues to the pronunciation of [[Middle Chinese]].\nChinese words with these pronunciations were also borrowed extensively into the local vernaculars, and today comprise over half their vocabularies.{{sfnp|Miyake|2004|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nThus Literary Chinese became the international language of scholarship in East Asia. \nLike [[Latin language|Latin]] in Europe it allowed scholars from different lands to communicate, and provided a stock of roots from which compound technical terms could be created.\nUnlike Latin, Literary Chinese was not used for spoken communication, and lacked the neutrality of Latin, being the language of an extant (and powerful) neighbouring state.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=67}}\n\nBooks in Literary Chinese were widely distributed.\nBy the 7th century and possibly earlier, [[woodblock printing]] had been developed in China.\nAt first, it was used only to copy the Buddhist scriptures, but later secular works were also printed.\nBy the 13th century, metal [[movable type]] was used by government printers in Korea, but seems not to have been extensively used in China, Vietnam or Japan.\nAt the same time manuscript reproduction remained important until the late 19th century.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=68}}\n\n== Vietnam ==\n{{see also|Literary Chinese in Vietnam}}\n[[File:Van Mieu Hanoi

area was [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|occupied by Chinese empires and states]] for almost all of the period from 111 BC to 938 AD.\nWhen Vietnam achieved independence, it continued to use Literary Chinese.\nAt first Buddhist monks dominated government and scholarship in the country.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|p=14}}\nThe earliest extant writings by Vietnamese authors are poems from the late 10th century, in Chinese, by the Buddhist monks Lac Thuan and [[Khu\u00f4ng Vi\u1ec7t]].{{sfnp|Coed\u00e8s|1966|p=87}}\n\nAfter three short-lived dynasties, the [[Ly Dynasty]] (1009\u20131225) was established with the support of Buddhist clergy, but soon came under increasing Confucian influence.\nA Confucian [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]] was erected in the capital, [[Hanoi]], in 1070.\n[[Confucian examination system in Vietnam|Civil service examination]]s on the Chinese model began in 1075, and in the following year a college was established for training sons of the ruling elite in the Confucian classics.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|p=14}}\nThe influence of Confucian literati grew in the following [[Tran Dynasty]] (1225\u20131400) until they had a monopoly on public office, which they kept, almost uninterrupted, until the examination system was abolished by the [[French Indochina|French colonial administration]] in 1913.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|pp=14, 31}}\n\n[[File:Phan Boi Chau.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Vietnamese nationalist [[Phan Boi Chau]] (1867\u20131940) wrote in Literary Chinese.]]\nDocuments that survive from the early Ly Dynasty include the ''[[Edict on the Transfer of the Capital]]'' (to Hanoi) from 1010.\nWhen the Chinese invaded the country in 1076, the general [[L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t]] wrote a 4-line poem ''[[Mountains and rivers of the Southern country]]''.\nHis poem was the first of a series of statements of Vietnamese determination to resist northern invaders, all written in Literary Chinese.\nOthers include a ''[[Proclamation to the Officers|Call to the Officers of the Army]]'' (1285), ''[[Tr\u1ea7n Quang Kh\u1ea3i|Return to the Capital]]'' (1288), the ''[[Great Proclamation upon the Pacification of the Wu]]'' (1428) and an ''[[Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7#Defeat of the Qing|Address to the Army]]'' (1789).{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|p=16}}{{sfnp|Nguyen|1981}}\nHistorical annals, beginning with the ''[[Annals of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]]'', were also written in Chinese, as were poetry and fiction of various kinds.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|p=17}}\n\nIn the centuries after independence, Vietnamese authors adapted Chinese characters to produce a script for their own language.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|pp=21\u201324}}\nThis script, called [[Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]], was quite complex, and accessible only to those who could read Chinese.{{sfnp|Hannas|1997|pp=79\u201380}}\nOver the centuries it became the vehicle for a flourishing vernacular literature, but all formal writing continued to be in Literary Chinese, except during two short-lived attempts at reform.\nWhen [[H\u1ed3 Qu\u00fd Ly]] seized the throne in 1400, as well as pursuing a programme of land reform, he sought to break the power of the Confucian literati by making Vietnamese the state language and translating the classics to make them available to all.\nThis was reversed in 1407 after [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]] invaded the country.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|pp=31\u201332}}\nSimilar reforms were attempted by [[Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7]] from 1788, but were again reversed at the beginning of the succeeding [[Nguyen Dynasty]] (1802\u20131945).{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|pp=40\u201344}}\nFinally both Literary Chinese and Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m were replaced by the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]] in the early 20th century.{{sfnp|Hannas|1997|pp=84\u201390}}\n\nVietnamese intellectuals continued to use Literary Chinese into the early 20th century.\nFor example, the nationalist [[Phan Boi Chau]] (1867\u20131940) wrote his ''[[History of the Loss of Vietnam]]'' (1905) and other tracts in Literary Chinese, and also used it to communicate when in Japan and China, as he spoke neither Japanese nor Chinese.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=67}}\n\n== Korea ==\n[[File:Tripitaka Koreana.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'', a Korean collection of the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]]]]\nChinese was first

Chinese institutions, laws and culture, including Buddhism.{{sfnp|Okazaki|1993|pp=298\u2013299}}\nThe influential Korean Buddhist scholar [[Wonhyo]] (617\u2013686) wrote extensively in Chinese.{{sfnp|Lee|Ramsey|2000|p=55}}\n\nThe use of Literary Chinese grew after the unification of the country by [[Silla]] in the late 7th century.\nA national institute (the [[Gukhak]]) was set up in 682 to teach the Chinese classics.\nPlaces and official positions were given Chinese names (with Sino-Korean pronunciation) so that they could be used in Literary Chinese.\n[[Gwageo|Civil service examinations]] on the Confucian classics were introduced in 958.{{sfnp|Sohn|Lee|2003|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nDuring the [[Goryeo]] period (918\u20131392), Korean scribes added interlinear annotations known as ''[[gugyeol]]'' (\"oral embellishment\") to Chinese texts to allow them to be read in Korean word order with Korean glosses.\nMany of the ''gugyeol'' characters were abbreviated, and some of them are identical in form and value to symbols in the Japanese [[katakana]] syllabary, though the historical relationship between the two is not yet clear.\nAn even more subtle method of annotation known as ''gakpil'' (\u89d2\u7b46 \"stylus\") was discovered in 2000, consisting of dots and lines made with a stylus.{{sfnp|Lee|Ramsey|2011|pp=83\u201384}}\n\n[[File:Hunminjeongum.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|King Sejong's proclamation of the [[Hangul]] script, written in Chinese]]\nAll formal writing, including the official annals of the Korean dynasties and almost all government documents, was done in Chinese until the late 19th century.\nSo too were the works of the Confucian scholars [[Toegye]] and [[Yulgok]] in the 16th century and [[Jeong Yak-yong]] at the end of the 18th.{{sfnp|Lee|Ramsey|2000|pp=55\u201356}}\nSeveral fiction genres were written in Chinese, including romances, beginning

popular in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfnp|Kim|2003|p=272}}\n\nEarly attempts to write the [[Korean language]] used a number of complex and unwieldy systems collectively known as [[Idu script|Idu]], using Chinese characters both for their meaning and their sound.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=116\u2013117}}\nThe [[Hangul]] alphabet announced in 1446 brought Korean reading and writing within reach of virtually the entire population.\n[[King Sejong]]'s announcement of the new script, ''[[The Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People]]'', was itself written in Literary Chinese like most such documents, and described the new letters in terms of Chinese metaphysics.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|p=118}}\nAlthough the new script was clearly more efficient, it was limited to informal writing and recording of folk tales until, as part of the [[Gabo Reform]] in December 1894, the civil examinations were abolished and government documents were required to be printed in Korean.\nEven then Korean was written with a composite script, with Chinese characters ([[Hanja]]) for the Sino-Korean words that now made up over half the vocabulary of the language interspersed with Hangul for native words and suffixes.{{sfnp|Lee|Ramsey|2000|pp=56\u201357}}\nHanja are still taught in schools in both parts of Korea, but fell out of use in North Korea in the late 1940s, and are increasingly rarely

centuries.\nThe early 8th century histories ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' and ''[[Kojiki]]'' credit a scholar called [[Wani (scholar)|Wani]] from [[Baekje]] with first bringing the Confucian classics to Japan,

re-arranged and read as Japanese.{{sfnp|Miller|1967|pp=115\u2013120}}\n\nThere had been experiments with adapting Chinese characters to write Japanese since the 7th century, and by the early 10th century these had been simplified to the [[kana]] syllabaries still in use today.{{sfnp|Miller|1967|pp=14\u201315, 121\u2013125}}\nHowever Chinese had such prestige in the Heian period that only women

[[Chinese Buddhism]] spread over East Asia between the 2nd and 5th centuries AD, followed by [[Confucianism]] as these countries developed strong central governments modelled on Chinese institutions.\nIn Vietnam and Korea, and for a shorter time in Japan and the [[Ryukyu Kingdom|Ryukyus]], scholar-officials were selected using examinations on the [[Confucian classics]] modelled on the Chinese [[imperial examination|civil service examination]]s.{{sfnp|Fogel|1997|p=686}}\nShared familiarity with the Chinese classics and Confucian values provided a common framework for intellectuals and ruling elites across the region.{{sfnp|Reischauer|1974|p=342}}\nAll of this was based on the use of [[Literary Chinese]], which became the medium of scholarship and government across the region.\nAlthough each of these countries developed vernacular writing systems and used them for popular literature, they continued to use Chinese for all formal writing until it was swept away by rising nationalism around the end of the 19th century.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|pp=75\u201377}}\n\nDuring the 20th century, several Japanese historians grouped these three countries with China as an [[East Asian cultural sphere|East Asian cultural realm]].\nAccording to {{interlanguage link|Sadao Nishijima|ja|\u897f\u5d8b\u5b9a\u751f}}, it was characterized by Chinese writing, [[Mahayana Buddhism]] in Chinese translation, [[Confucianism]] and [[Traditional Chinese law|Chinese legal codes]].{{sfnp|Xiong|2006|p=302}}\nThe concept of an \"East Asian world\" has seen little interest from scholars in the other countries following its appropriation by Japanese militarists in terms such as the \"[[Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere]]\".{{sfnp|Wang|2002|p=322}}\nNishijima is also credited with coining the expressions ''Kanji bunka-ken'' ({{lang|ja|\u6f22\u5b57\u6587\u5316\u570f}}, 'Chinese-character culture sphere') and ''Ch\u016bka bunka-ken'' ({{lang|ja|\u4e2d\u83ef\u6587\u5316\u570f}}, 'Chinese culture sphere'), which were later borrowed into Chinese.{{efn|The phrase ''bunka-ken'' ({{lang|ja|\u6587\u5316\u5708}}, 'culture sphere', Chinese ''{{lang|zh-Latn-pinyin|w\u00e9nhu\u00e0 qu\u0101n}}'') originated in the 1940s as a translation of the German term ''[[Kulturkreis]]'' in the work of [[Fritz Gr\u00e4bner]] and [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]].<ref>{{cite web | given = Victor | surname = Mair | author-link = Victor H.

Masters-1377.jpg|thumb|right|The Korean Buddhist work ''[[Jikji]]'' is the oldest extant book printed with movable metal type (1377).]]\nAt the beginning of the current era, the [[Chinese script]] was the only writing system available in East Asia.\nClassical works of the [[Warring States period]] and [[Han dynasty]] such as the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'', the ''[[Commentary of Zuo]]'' and [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian|Historical Records]]'' were admired as models of prose style through the ages.\nLater writers sought to emulate the classical style, writing in a form known as Literary Chinese.{{efn|Some writers refer to Literary Chinese as \"Classical Chinese\", but linguists prefer to reserve the latter term for the language of the classics themselves.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=83}}}}\nThus the written style, based on the [[Old Chinese]] of the classical period, remained largely static as the various [[varieties of Chinese]] developed and diverged to become mutually unintelligible, and all distinct from the written form.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=83}}\nMoreover, in response to phonetic attrition the spoken varieties developed compound words and new syntactic forms.\nIn comparison, the literary language was admired for its terseness and economy of expression, but it was difficult to understand if read aloud, even in the local pronunciation.\nThis divergence is a classic example of [[diglossia]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=245\u2013246, 249\u2013250}}\n\nAll formal writing in China was done in Literary Chinese until the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919, after which it was replaced by [[Written Vernacular Chinese]].\nThis new form was based on the vocabulary and grammar of modern [[Mandarin dialects]], particularly the [[Beijing dialect]], and is the written form of [[Modern Standard Chinese]].\nLiterary Chinese persisted for a time in journalism and government, but was replaced there too in the late 1940s.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=247}}\n\n[[Buddhism]] reached China from central Asia in the first century AD, and over the following centuries the Buddhist scriptures were translated into Literary Chinese.\nBuddhist missionaries then spread these texts throughout East Asia, and students of the new religion learned the language of these sacred texts.{{sfnp|Miller|1967|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nThroughout East Asia, Literary Chinese was the language of administration and scholarship.\nAlthough Vietnam, Korea and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, these were limited to popular literature.\nChinese remained the medium of formal writing until it was displaced by vernacular writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|pp=66\u201367}}\nThough they did not use Chinese for spoken communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]], which provide clues to the pronunciation of [[Middle Chinese]].\nChinese words with these pronunciations were also borrowed extensively into the local vernaculars, and today comprise over half their vocabularies.{{sfnp|Miyake|2004|pp=98\u201399}}\n\nThus Literary Chinese became the international language of scholarship in East Asia. \nLike [[Latin language|Latin]] in Europe it allowed scholars from different lands to communicate, and provided a stock of roots from which compound technical terms could be created.\nUnlike Latin, Literary Chinese was not used for spoken communication, and lacked the neutrality of Latin, being the language of an extant (and powerful) neighbouring state.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=67}}\n\nBooks in Literary Chinese were widely distributed.\nBy the 7th century and possibly earlier, [[woodblock printing]] had been developed in China.\nAt first, it was used only to copy the Buddhist scriptures, but later secular works were also printed.\nBy the 13th century, metal [[movable type]] was used by government printers in Korea, but seems not to have been extensively used in China, Vietnam or Japan.\nAt the same time manuscript reproduction remained important until the late 19th century.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=68}}\n\n== Vietnam ==\n{{see also|Literary Chinese in Vietnam}}\n[[File:Van Mieu Hanoi

area was [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|occupied by Chinese empires and states]] for almost all of the period from 111 BC to 938 AD.\nWhen Vietnam achieved independence, it continued to use Literary Chinese.\nAt first Buddhist monks dominated government and scholarship in the country.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|p=14}}\nThe earliest extant writings by Vietnamese authors are poems from the late 10th century, in Chinese, by the Buddhist monks Lac Thuan and [[Khu\u00f4ng Vi\u1ec7t]].{{sfnp|Coed\u00e8s|1966|p=87}}\n\nAfter three short-lived dynasties, the [[Ly Dynasty]] (1009\u20131225) was established with the support of Buddhist clergy, but soon came under increasing Confucian influence.\nA Confucian [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]] was erected in the capital, [[Hanoi]], in 1070.\n[[Confucian examination system in Vietnam|Civil service examination]]s on the Chinese model began in 1075, and in the following year a college was established for training sons of the ruling elite in the Confucian classics.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|p=14}}\nThe influence of Confucian literati grew in the following [[Tran Dynasty]] (1225\u20131400) until they had a monopoly on public office, which they kept, almost uninterrupted, until the examination system was abolished by the [[French Indochina|French colonial administration]] in 1913.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|pp=14, 31}}\n\n[[File:Phan Boi Chau.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Vietnamese nationalist [[Phan Boi Chau]] (1867\u20131940) wrote in Literary Chinese.]]\nDocuments that survive from the early Ly Dynasty include the ''[[Edict on the Transfer of the Capital]]'' (to Hanoi) from 1010.\nWhen the Chinese invaded the country in 1076, the general [[L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t]] wrote a 4-line poem ''[[Mountains and rivers of the Southern country]]''.\nHis poem was the first of a series of statements of Vietnamese determination to resist northern invaders, all written in Literary Chinese.\nOthers include a ''[[Proclamation to the Officers|Call to the Officers of the Army]]'' (1285), ''[[Tr\u1ea7n Quang Kh\u1ea3i|Return to the Capital]]'' (1288), the ''[[Great Proclamation upon the Pacification of the Wu]]'' (1428) and an ''[[Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7#Defeat of the Qing|Address to the Army]]'' (1789).{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|p=16}}{{sfnp|Nguyen|1981}}\nHistorical annals, beginning with the ''[[Annals of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t]]'', were also written in Chinese, as were poetry and fiction of various kinds.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|p=17}}\n\nIn the centuries after independence, Vietnamese authors adapted Chinese characters to produce a script for their own language.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|pp=21\u201324}}\nThis script, called [[Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]], was quite complex, and accessible only to those who could read Chinese.{{sfnp|Hannas|1997|pp=79\u201380}}\nOver the centuries it became the vehicle for a flourishing vernacular literature, but all formal writing continued to be in Literary Chinese, except during two short-lived attempts at reform.\nWhen [[H\u1ed3 Qu\u00fd Ly]] seized the throne in 1400, as well as pursuing a programme of land reform, he sought to break the power of the Confucian literati by making Vietnamese the state language and translating the classics to make them available to all.\nThis was reversed in 1407 after [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]] invaded the country.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|pp=31\u201332}}\nSimilar reforms were attempted by [[Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7]] from 1788, but were again reversed at the beginning of the succeeding [[Nguyen Dynasty]] (1802\u20131945).{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|pp=40\u201344}}\nFinally both Literary Chinese and Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m were replaced by the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]] in the early 20th century.{{sfnp|Hannas|1997|pp=84\u201390}}\n\nVietnamese intellectuals continued to use Literary Chinese into the early 20th century.\nFor example, the nationalist [[Phan Boi Chau]] (1867\u20131940) wrote his ''[[History of the Loss of Vietnam]]'' (1905) and other tracts in Literary Chinese, and also used it to communicate when in Japan and China, as he spoke neither Japanese nor Chinese.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=67}}\n\n== Korea ==\n[[File:Tripitaka Koreana.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'', a Korean collection of the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]]]]\nChinese was first

Commanderies]].{{sfnp|Sohn|Lee|2003|p=23}}\nBuddhism arrived in Korea from China in the late 4th century, and spread from there to Japan.\nThe [[Goguryeo]] kingdom strengthened itself by adopting Chinese institutions, laws and culture, including Buddhism.{{sfnp|Okazaki|1993|pp=298\u2013299}}\nThe influential Korean Buddhist scholar [[Wonhyo]] (617\u2013686) wrote extensively in Chinese.{{sfnp|Lee|Ramsey|2000|p=55}}\n\nThe use of Literary Chinese grew after the unification of the country by [[Silla]] in the late 7th century.\nA national institute (the [[Gukhak]]) was set up in 682 to teach the Chinese classics.\nPlaces and official positions were given Chinese names (with Sino-Korean pronunciation) so that they could be used in Literary Chinese.\n[[Gwageo|Civil service examinations]] on the Confucian classics were introduced in 958.{{sfnp|Sohn|Lee|2003|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nDuring the [[Goryeo]] period (918\u20131392), Korean scribes added interlinear annotations known as ''[[gugyeol]]'' (\"oral embellishment\") to Chinese texts to allow them to be read in Korean word order with Korean glosses.\nMany of the ''gugyeol'' characters were abbreviated, and some of them are identical in form and value to symbols in the Japanese [[katakana]] syllabary, though the historical relationship between the two is not yet clear.\nAn even more subtle method of annotation known as ''gakpil'' (\u89d2\u7b46 \"stylus\") was discovered in 2000, consisting of dots and lines made with a stylus.{{sfnp|Lee|Ramsey|2011|pp=83\u201384}}\n\n[[File:Hunminjeongum.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|King Sejong's proclamation of the [[Hangul]] script, written in Chinese]]\nAll formal writing, including the official annals of the Korean dynasties and almost all government documents, was done in Chinese until the late 19th century.\nSo too were the works of the Confucian scholars [[Toegye]] and [[Yulgok]] in the 16th century and [[Jeong Yak-yong]] at the end of the 18th.{{sfnp|Lee|Ramsey|2000|pp=55\u201356}}\nSeveral fiction genres were written in Chinese, including romances, beginning with the 15th century ''[[New Stories from Gold Turtle Mountain]]''.{{sfnp|Kim|2003|pp=261\u2013262}}\nThe ''[[Eou yadam]]'' (c. 1600) began a new genre of unofficial histories, which became very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{sfnp|Kim|2003|p=272}}\n\nEarly attempts to write the [[Korean language]] used a number of complex and unwieldy systems collectively known as [[Idu script|Idu]], using Chinese characters both for their meaning and their sound.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|pp=116\u2013117}}\nThe [[Hangul]] alphabet announced in 1446 brought Korean reading and writing within reach of virtually the entire population.\n[[King Sejong]]'s announcement of the new script, ''[[The Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People]]'', was itself written in Literary Chinese like most such documents, and described the new letters in terms of Chinese metaphysics.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|p=118}}\nAlthough the new script was clearly more efficient, it was limited to informal writing and recording of folk tales until, as part of the [[Gabo Reform]] in December 1894, the civil examinations were abolished and government documents were required to be printed in Korean.\nEven then Korean was written with a composite script, with Chinese characters ([[Hanja]]) for the Sino-Korean words that now made up over half the vocabulary of the language interspersed with Hangul for native words and suffixes.{{sfnp|Lee|Ramsey|2000|pp=56\u201357}}\nHanja are still taught in schools in both parts of Korea, but fell out of use in North Korea in the late 1940s, and are increasingly rarely used in South Korea.{{sfnp|Coulmas|1991|p=122}}{{sfnp|Hannas|1997|p=68}}\n\n== Japan ==\n[[File:Nihonshoki tanaka version.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', an 8th-century history of Japan

centuries.\nThe early 8th century histories ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' and ''[[Kojiki]]'' credit a scholar called [[Wani (scholar)|Wani]] from [[Baekje]] with first bringing the Confucian classics to Japan, though many scholars have questioned this account.{{sfnp|Cranston|1993|pp=453\u2013454}}\nBy 607 Japan had opened direct contacts with [[Sui dynasty]] China, continued under the following [[Tang

century these had been simplified to the [[kana]] syllabaries still in use today.{{sfnp|Miller|1967|pp=14\u201315, 121\u2013125}}\nHowever Chinese had such prestige in the Heian period that only women and low-status men wrote in Japanese.\nAs a result, court women produced much of the Japanese-language fiction of the period, with the most famous being the ''[[Tale of Genji]]''.{{sfnp|Varley|2000|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nAround 700, an imperial academy (the [[Daigaku-ry\u014d]]) was founded to train the sons of the aristocracy in Chinese and the classics and to administer the first stage of civil service examinations.\nIt flourished in the 9th century but went into decline in the 10th, as the central bureaucracy and use of Chinese faded away.\nBy 1135 the site was overgrown; the buildings were destroyed in the great fire of 1177.{{sfnp|Ury|1999|pp=367\u2013373}}\nBy the 13th century knowledge of Literary Chinese had become so limited that the government had to delegate official writing, including correspondence before the unsuccessful [[Mongol invasions of Japan]], to the Buddhist clergy.{{sfnp|Miller|1967|p=42}}\n\nThe re-establishment of strong central government by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in 1600 was followed by a [[Edo Neo-Confucianism|revival of Confucianism]].{{sfnp|Masahide|1991|pp=397\u2013404}}{{sfnp|Varley|2000|pp=170\u2013173}}\nLiterary Chinese remained the preferred medium for formal writing until the late 19th century.{{sfnp|Twine|1991|pp=34\u201335, 45\u201348}}\nA style mixing Chinese and Japanese elements (''s\u014dr\u014dbun'') was derived from the medieval ''hentai-kanbun'' (\"variant Chinese writing\") used in such works as the historical chronicle ''[[Azuma Kagami]]'' (1266).\nIt was used during the [[Meiji period]], and as late as the end of the Second World War, by men for diaries and correspondence, and for various public notices.{{sfnp|Twine|1991|pp=34\u201335, 45\u201348}}\nBoth have since been replaced by writing in Japanese, using a script combining Chinese characters ([[Kanji]]) and kana syllabaries.\n\n== Other states ==\n\nIn the Tang period, other neighbouring states adopted Chinese culture and institutions, including using Chinese as the written language of administration, both to cultivate good relations with China and to strengthen their own administrations.{{sfnp|Twitchett|1979a|pp=32\u201333}}\nThe kingdom of [[Balhae]], established in northern Korea and eastern Manchuria in 698, followed its southern neighbour [[Later Silla|Silla]] in establishing a Chinese-style administration.{{sfnp|Twitchett|1979b|p=441}}\nDuring the reign of [[Mun of Balhae|King Mun]] (737\u2013793), the state imported Chinese literary culture and institutions wholesale.{{sfnp|Twitchett|1979b|pp=442\u2013443}}\nSimilarly, the kingdom of [[Nanzhao]] to the southwest used Chinese as the language of administration and adopted Tang laws and procedures.{{sfnp|Twitchett|1979a|p=33}}\nBy adopting Chinese institutions, these states became stronger and more stable than their predecessors.\nThey observed the formalities of tribute to the Tang, but functioned as independent states.{{sfnp|Twitchett|1979a|p=33}}\n\nIn the late 14th century, the three principalities on [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] opened relations with [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] China.{{sfnp|Kerr|2000|pp=65\u201366, 73\u201374}}\nIn 1393, a community of clerks and craftsmen from [[Fujian]] was established at [[Kumemura|Kume]], near the port of [[Naha]] in the central kingdom of [[Ch\u016bzan]].\nThe clerks taught the Chinese written language, and served the government in its relations with China.{{sfnp|Kerr|2000|p=75}}\nFrom the late 14th century, selected sons of the nobility of Ch\u016bzan, and later the unified [[Ryukyu Kingdom]], were sent to the [[Guozijian]] in the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] capital to study the Chinese classics.\nOn their return they would occupy high offices in the government.{{sfnp|Kerr|2000|pp=78\u201379, 225\u2013226}}\nLocal forms of examination in the Chinese classics were also used to select candidates for high office.{{sfnp|Kerr|2000|pp=186\u2013187}}\nHowever, by the 17th century Japanese influence had become predominant, and the use of Chinese was limited and artificial.{{sfnp|Kerr|2000|pp=224\u2013225}}\nBy the mid-19th century, the Kume school teaching the Chinese classics had been overshadowed as an educator of future administrators by an academy in the capital of [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]] teaching in Japanese.{{sfnp|Kerr|2000|p=346}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations

Burns, in Feeling Good the new Mood Therapy  <ref>{{cite book |last1=Burns |first1=David D. |title=Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy |date=1980}}</ref>, described personal and professional anecdotes related to cognitive distortions and their elimination.\n\nCognitive distortions are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately. According to the cognitive model of Beck, a negative outlook on reality, sometimes called ''negative [[schema (psychology)|schemas]]'' (or ''schemata''), is a factor in symptoms of emotional dysfunction and poorer subjective well-being. Specifically, negative thinking patterns reinforce negative [[Emotion|emotions]] and thoughts.<ref name=\"grohol\">{{cite web|last=Grohol |first=John |year=2009 |title=15 Common Cognitive Distortions |url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/2009/15-common-cognitive-distortions/ |publisher=PsychCentral |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707124344/http://psychcentral.com/lib/2009/15-common-cognitive-distortions/ |archivedate=2009-07-07 }}</ref> During difficult circumstances, these distorted thoughts can contribute to an overall negative outlook on the world and a depressive or anxious mental state.\n\nChallenging and changing cognitive distortions is a key element of [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)]].\n\n==Definition==\nCognitive comes from the Medieval Latin ''cognit\u012bvus'', equivalent to Latin cognit(us) known.<ref>{{Dictionary.com|Cognitive |accessdate=2020-03-14}}</ref> Distortion means the act of twisting or altering something out of its true, natural, or original state.<ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Distortion|accessdate=2020-03-14}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nIn 1957, Albert Ellis thought he did not know it yet, would aid cognitive therapy in correcting Cognitive Distortions and indirectly helping David Burns in writing The Feeling Good Handbook. Ellis created what he called the ABC Technique of rational beliefs. The ABC stand for (A)Activating Event, (B)beliefs that are irrational and (C) the consequences that come from the belief. Ellis wanted to prove that the activating event is not what caused the emotional behavior or the consequences, but the beliefs and how the person irrationally perceive the events that aids the consequences.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McLeod |first1=Saul A. |title=Cognitive Behavioral Therapy |url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-therapy.html |website=SimplyPsychology}}</ref> With this model Ellis attempted to use Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) with his patients, in order to help them \"reframe\" or reinterpret the experience in a more rational manner. In this model Ellis explains it all for his clients, while Beck helps his clients figure this out on their own.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=Albert |title=Rational Psychotherapy and Individual Psychology |journal=Journal of Individual Psychology |year=1957 |volume=13 |page=42}}</ref> Beck first started to notice these automatic distorted thought processes when practicing psychoanalysis while his patients followed the rule of saying anything that comes to mind. Aaron realized that his patients had irrational fears, thoughts, and perceptions that were automatic. Beck began noticing his automatic thought processes that he knew his patients had but did not report. Most of the time the thoughts were biased against themselves and very erroneous.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Beck |first1=Aaron T. |title=The Past and Future of Cognitive Therapy |journal=Journal of Psychotherapy and Research |year=1997 |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=277}}</ref>\n\nBeck believed that the negative schemas developed and manifested themselves in the perspective and behavior. The distorted thought processes lead to focusing on degrading the self, amplifying minor external setbacks, experiences other's harmless comments as ill-intended, while simultaneously seeing self as inferior. Inevitably cognitions are reflected in their behavior with a reduce desire to care for self, to seek pleasure and give up. These exaggerated perceptions due to cognition feel real and accurate because the schemas after being reinforced through the behavior tend to become automatic and do not allow time for reflection.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kovacs |first1=Maria |last2=Beck |first2=Aaron T. |title=Maladaptive Cognitive Structure in Depression |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |year=1986 |page=526}}</ref> This cycle is also known as [[Beck's Cognitive Triad]], focused on the theory that the person's negative schema applied to the self, the future, and the environment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beck |first1=Aaron T. |title=Depression Causes and Treatment |date=1967 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press. |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |page=166}}</ref>\n\n\nIn 1972, psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, and [[cognitive therapy]] scholar Aaron T.

People may be taught how to identify and alter these distortions as part of [[cognitive behavioural therapy]].]]\nThe cognitive distortions listed below<ref name=\"burns\" /> are categories of automatic thinking, and are to be distinguished from [[logical fallacy|logical fallacies]].<ref name=\"tagg\">{{cite web |url= http://daphne.palomar.edu/jtagg/cds.htm#cogdis |title=Cognitive Distortions |first=John |last=Tagg |year=1996 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101230140/http://daphne.palomar.edu:80/jtagg/cds.htm|archivedate=November 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===All-or-nothing thinking===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nThis is also referred to as \u201cSplitting,\"<ref name=\"mentalhelp.net\">{{cite web |title=Cognitive Distortions Affecting Stress |url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/cognitive-disorders/stress/ |website=MentalHelp.net |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> \u201cBlack-and-White Thinking,\"<ref name=\"grohol\" /> and \"Polarized Thinking.\"<ref name=\"Grohol\">{{cite web |last1=Grohol |first1=John M. |title=15 Common Cognitive Distortions |url=https://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/ |website=PsychCentral |date=17 May 2016 |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> Someone with the All-or-Nothing Thinking distortion looks at life in black and white categories.<ref name=\"burns\" /> Either they are a success or a failure; either they are good or bad; there is no in-between. According to one article, \u201cBecause there is always someone who is willing to criticize, this tends to collapse into a tendency for polarized people to view themselves as a total failure. Polarized thinkers have difficulty with the notion of being \u2018good enough\u2019 or a partial success.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Cognitive Distortions Affecting Stress |url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/cognitive-disorders/stress/ |website=MentalHelp.net |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>\n* Example (from ''The Feeling Good Handbook''): A girl  eats a spoonful of ice cream. She thinks she is a complete failure for breaking her diet. She becomes so depressed that she ends up eating the whole quart of ice cream.<ref name=\"burns\" />\nThis example captures the polarized nature of this distortion--the person believes they are totally inadequate if they fall short of perfection. \nIn order to combat this distortion, Burns suggests thinking of the world in terms of shades of gray.<ref name=\"burns\" /> Rather than viewing herself as a complete failure for eating a spoonful of ice cream, the girl in the example could still recognize her overall effort to diet as at least a partial success.\n\n=== Overgeneralizing ===\nMaking [[hasty generalization]]s from insufficient evidence. Seeing a \u201csingle negative event\u201d as a \u201cnever-ending pattern of defeat.\"<ref name=\"burns\" /> Drawing a very broad conclusion from a single incident or a single piece of evidence. Even if something bad happens only once, it is expected to happen over and over again.<ref name=\"grohol\" />\n* Example 1: A young woman is asked out on a first date, but not a second one. She is distraught as she tells her friend, \u201cThis always happens to me! I\u2019ll never find love!\u201d\n* Example 2: A woman is lonely and often spends most of her time at home. Her friends sometimes ask her to dinner and to meet new people. She feels it is useless to even try. No one really could like her. And anyway, all people are the same; petty and selfish.<ref name=\"about\">{{cite web|last=Schimelpfening|first=Nancy|title=You Are What You Think|url=http://depression.about.com/cs/psychotherapy/a/cognitive.htm}}</ref>\nOne suggestion to combat this distortion is to \u201cExamine the Evidence\u201d by performing an accurate analysis of one\u2019s situation. This aids in avoiding exaggerating one\u2019s circumstances.<ref name=\"burns\" />\n\n=== Filtering === \nFiltering distortions occur when an individual dwells only on the negative details of a situation and filters out the positive aspects.<ref name=\"burns\" />\n* Example: Andy gets mostly compliments and positive feedback about a presentation he has done at work, but he also has received a small piece of criticism. For several days following his presentation, Andy dwells on this one negative reaction, forgetting all of the positive reactions that he had also been given.<ref name=\"burns\" />\n''The Feeling Good Handbook'' notes that filtering is like a \u201cdrop of ink that discolors a beaker of water.\"<ref name=\"burns\" /> One suggestion to combat filtering is a cost-benefit analysis. A person with this distortion may want to sit down and assess whether filtering out the positive and focusing on the negative is helping or hurting them in the long run.<ref name=\"burns\" />\n\n=== Disqualifying the positive===\nDisqualifying the positive refers to rejecting positive experiences by insisting they \"don't count\" for some reason or other. Negative belief is maintained despite contradiction by everyday experiences. Disqualifying the positive may be the most common fallacy in the cognitive distortion range; it is often analyzed with \"always being right\", a type of distortion where a person is in an all-or-nothing self-judgment. People in this situation show signs of depression.\n*Examples:\n*\"I will never be as good as Jane\"\n*\"Anyone could have done as well\"<ref name=\"burns\" />\n*\"They are just congratulating me to be nice\"<ref>{{cite web |website=Palomar |url=https://www2.palomar.edu/users/jtagg/disqual.htm|title=Disqualifying the Positive |accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Jumping to conclusions ===\n{{Main|Jumping to conclusions}}\nReaching preliminary conclusions (usually negative) with little (if any) evidence. Two specific subtypes are identified:\n* '''Mind reading:''' [[Inference|Inferring]] a person's possible or probable (usually negative) thoughts from his or her [[behavior]] and [[nonverbal communication]]; taking precautions against the worst suspected case without asking the person.\n** Example 1: A student assumes that the readers of his or her paper have already made up their minds concerning its topic, and, therefore, writing the paper is a pointless exercise.<ref name=\"tagg\" />\n** Example 2: Kevin assumes that because he sits alone at lunch, everyone else must think he is a loser. (This can encourage self-fulfilling prophecy; Kevin may not initiate social contact because of his fear that those around him already perceive him negatively).<ref>{{cite web |title=Cognitive Distortions: Jumping to Conclusions & All or Nothing Thinking |url=https://www.getmoodfit.com/single-post/2016/12/22/Cognitive-Distortions-Jumping-to-Conclusions-All-or-Nothing-Thinking |website=Moodfit |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> \n* '''Fortune-telling:''' predicting outcomes (usually negative) of events\n** Example : A depressed person tells themselves they will never improve; they will continue to be depressed for their whole life.<ref name=\"burns\" />\nOne way to combat this distortion is to ask, \u201cIf this is true, does it say more about me or them?<ref>{{cite web |title=Common Cognitive Distortions: Mind Reading |url=http://cogbtherapy.com/cbt-blog/common-cognitive-distortions-mind-reading |website=Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - Los Angeles |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>\u201d \n\n=== Magnification and minimization ===\n{{Main|Exaggeration|Minimisation (psychology)}}\nGiving proportionally greater weight to a perceived failure, weakness or threat, or lesser weight to a perceived success, strength or opportunity, so that the weight differs from that assigned by others, such as \"[[make a mountain out of a molehill|making a mountain out of a molehill]]\". In depressed clients, often the positive characteristics of ''other people'' are exaggerated and their negative characteristics are understated.\n* ''[[Catastrophizing]]'' \u2013 Giving greater weight to the worst possible outcome, however unlikely, or experiencing a situation as unbearable or impossible when it is just uncomfortable\n\n=== Emotional reasoning ===\n{{Main|Emotional reasoning}}\nIn the emotional reasoning distortion, it is assumed that feelings expose the true nature of things and experience reality as a reflection of emotionally linked thoughts; something is believed true solely based on a feeling.\n* Examples: \"I feel stupid, therefore I must be stupid\".<ref name=\"grohol\" /> Feeling fear of flying in planes, and then concluding that planes must be a dangerous way to travel.<ref name=\"burns\" /> Feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of cleaning one's house, therefore concluding that it's hopeless to even start cleaning.<ref name=\"about\" /> \n\n=== Making \"must\" or \"should\" statements ===\n[[Rational emotive behavior therapy#Core beliefs that disturb humans|Making \"must\" or \"should\" statements]] was included by [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] in his [[Rational emotive behavior therapy|rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT)]], an early form of CBT; he termed it \"musturbation\". Michael C. Graham called it \"expecting the world to be different than it is\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=37}}</ref> It can be seen as demanding particular achievements or behaviors regardless of the realistic circumstances of the situation. \n* Example: After a performance, a concert pianist believes he or she should not have made so many mistakes.<ref name=\"about\" />\n* In ''Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy'', David Burns clearly distinguished between pathological \"should statements\", moral imperatives, and social norms.\nA related cognitive distortion, also present in Ellis' REBT, is a tendency to \"[[Rational emotive behavior therapy#Core beliefs that disturb humans|awfulize]]\"; to say a future scenario will be awful, rather than to realistically appraise the various negative and positive characteristics of that scenario.\nAccording to Burns, \u201cmust\u2019 and \u201cshould\u201d statements are negative because they cause the person to feel guilty and upset at themselves. Some people also direct this distortion at other people, which can cause feelings of anger and frustration when that other person does not do what they \u201cshould\u201d have done. He also mentions how this type of thinking can lead to rebellious thoughts. In other words, trying to whip oneself into doing something with \u201cshoulds\u201d may cause one to desire just the opposite.<ref name=\"burns\" />\n\n===Personalization and Blaming ===\n{{Main|Blaming}}\nPersonalization is assigning personal blame disproportionate to the level of control a person realistically has in a given situation. \n* Example 1: A foster child assumes that he/she has not been adopted because he/she is not \u201cloveable enough.\u201d \n* Example 2: A child has bad grades. His/her mother believes it is because she is not a good enough parent.<ref name=\"burns\" />\nBlaming is the opposite of personalization. In the blaming distortion, the disproportionate level of blame is placed upon other people, rather than oneself.<ref name=\"burns\" /> In this way, the person avoids taking personal responsibility, making way for a \u201cvictim mentality.\u201d \n* Example: Placing blame for marital problems entirely on one\u2019s spouse.<ref name=\"burns\" />\n\n===Always being right===\nIn this cognitive distortion, being wrong is unthinkable. This distortion is characterized by actively trying to prove one's actions or thoughts to be correct, and sometimes prioritizing [[Self|self-interest]] over the feelings of another person.<ref name=\"grohol\" />. In this Cognitive Distortion, the facts that oneself has about its surroundings are always right while other people opinions and perspectives are wrongly seen <ref>{{cite web |website=PsychCentral |title=15 Common Cognitive Distortions |date=2016-05-17 |url=https://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/ |accessdate=2020-02-28}}</ref> \n\n===Fallacy of change===\nRelying on [[social control]] to obtain cooperative actions from another person<ref name=\"grohol\" /> The underlying assumption of this thinking style is that one's happiness depends on the actions of others. The fallacy of change also assumes that other people should change to suit one's own interests automatically and/or that it is fair to pressure them to change. It may be present in most abusive relationships in which partners' \"visions\" of each other are tied into the belief that happiness, love, trust, and perfection would just occur once they or the other person change aspects of their beings.<ref>{{cite web |website=Abate Counseling |url=http://abatecounselling.ie/2018/08/30/fallacy-of-change-15-types-of-distorted-thinking-that-lead-to-massive-anxiety-10-15/|title=Fallacy of Change: 15 types of distorted thinking that lead to massive anxiety 10/15|date=2018-08-30}}</ref>\n\n===Fallacy of fairness===\nFallacy of fairness is the belief that life should be fair. When life is perceived to be unfair, an angry emotional state is produced which may lead to attempts to correct the situation.<ref name=\"grohol\" /> There are few situations in which \"universal justice\" can be applied or excluded. Justice comes from the late Old English justice \u2018administration of the law\u2019, fairness and justice do not vary between culture, people, or country, it is seen that they need to be attributed in any situation.<ref>{{cite web |website=Real Clear Politics |url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/02/09/the_fallacy_of_fairness__100219.html|title=Fallacy of Change: 15 types of distorted thinking that lead to massive anxiety 10/15}}</ref>\n\n=== Labeling and mislabeling ===\n{{Main|Labeling theory}}\nA form of overgeneralization; attributing a person's actions to his or her character instead of to an attribute. Rather than assuming the behaviour to be accidental or otherwise extrinsic, one assigns a label to someone or something that is based on the inferred character of that person or thing.\n\n== Cognitive restructuring ==\n[[Cognitive restructuring]] (CR) is a popular form of therapy used to identify and reject maladaptive cognitive distortions<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gil |first=Pedro J.

For example, a depressed male college student who experiences difficulty in dating might believe that his \"worthlessness\" causes women to reject him. Together, therapist and client might then create a more realistic cognition, e.g., \"It is within my control to ask girls on dates. However, even though there are some things I can do to influence their decisions, whether or not they say yes is largely out of my control. Thus, I am not responsible if they decline my invitation.\" CR therapies are designed to eliminate \"automatic thoughts\" that include clients' dysfunctional or negative views.

If the perceptions of the patient differ from those of the therapist, it may not be because of intellectual malfunctions but because the patient has different experiences.

According to the cognitive model of Beck, a negative outlook on reality, sometimes called ''negative [[schema (psychology)|schemas]]'' (or ''schemata''), is a factor in symptoms of emotional dysfunction and poorer subjective well-being. Specifically, negative thinking patterns reinforce negative [[Emotion|emotions]] and thoughts.<ref name=\"grohol\">{{cite web|last=Grohol |first=John |date=2009 |title=15 Common Cognitive Distortions |url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/2009/15-common-cognitive-distortions/ |publisher=PsychCentral |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707124344/http://psychcentral.com/lib/2009/15-common-cognitive-distortions/ |archivedate=2009-07-07 }}</ref> During difficult circumstances, these distorted thoughts can contribute to an overall negative outlook on the world and a depressive or anxious mental state.\n\nChallenging and changing cognitive distortions is a key element of [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)]].\n\n==Definition==\nCognitive comes from the Medieval Latin ''cognit\u012bvus'', equivalent to Latin cognit(us) known.<ref>{{Dictionary.com|Cognitive |accessdate=2020-03-14}}</ref> Distortion means the act of twisting or altering something out of its true, natural, or original state.<ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Distortion|accessdate=2020-03-14}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nIn 1957, Albert Ellis thought he did not know it yet, would aid cognitive therapy in correcting Cognitive Distortions and indirectly helping David Burns in writing The Feeling Good Handbook. Ellis created what he called the ABC Technique of rational beliefs. The ABC stand for (A)Activating Event, (B)beliefs that are irrational and (C) the consequences that come from the belief. Ellis wanted to prove that the activating event is not what caused the emotional behavior or the consequences, but the beliefs and how the person irrationally perceive the events that aids the consequences.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McLeod |first1=Saul A. |title=Cognitive Behavioral Therapy |url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-therapy.html |website=SimplyPsychology}}</ref> With this model Ellis attempted to use Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) with his patients, in order to help them \"reframe\" or reinterpret the experience in a more rational manner. In this model Ellis explains it all for his clients, while Beck helps his clients figure this out on their own.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ellis |first1=Albert |title=Rational Psychotherapy and Individual Psychology |journal=Journal of Individual Psychology |date=1957 |volume=13 |page=42 |pages=38-44}}</ref> Beck first started to notice these automatic distorted thought processes when practicing psychoanalysis while his patients followed the rule of saying anything that comes to mind. Aaron realized that his patients had irrational fears, thoughts, and perceptions that were automatic. Beck began noticing his automatic thought processes that he knew his patients had but did not report. Most of the time the thoughts were biased against themselves and very erroneous.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Beck |first1=Aaron T. |title=The Past and Future of Cognitive Therapy |journal=Journal of Psychotherapy and Research |date=1997 |volume=6 |issue=4 |page=277 |pages=276-284}}</ref>\n\nBeck believed that the negative schemas developed and manifested themselves in the perspective and behavior. The distorted thought processes lead to focusing on degrading the self, amplifying minor external setbacks, experiences other's harmless comments as ill-intended, while simultaneously seeing self as inferior. Inevitably cognitions are reflected in their behavior with a reduce desire to care for self, to seek pleasure and give up. These exaggerated perceptions due to cognition feel real and accurate because the schemas after being reinforced through the behavior tend to become automatic and do not allow time for reflection.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kovacs |first1=Maria |last2=Beck |first2=Aaron T. |title=Maladaptive Cognitive Structure in Depression |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |date=1986 |page=526}}</ref> This cycle is also known as [[Beck's Cognitive Triad]], focused on the theory that the person's negative schema applied to the self, the future, and the environment.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beck |first1=Aaron T. |title=Depression Causes and Treatment |date=1967 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press. |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |page=166}}</ref>\n\n\nIn 1972, psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, and [[cognitive therapy]] scholar Aaron T.

According to one article, \u201cBecause there is always someone who is willing to criticize, this tends to collapse into a tendency for polarized people to view themselves as a total failure. Polarized thinkers have difficulty with the notion of being \u2018good enough\u2019 or a partial success.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Cognitive Distortions Affecting Stress |url=https://www.mentalhelp.net/cognitive-disorders/stress/ |website=MentalHelp.net |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>\n* Example (from ''The Feeling Good Handbook''): A girl  eats a spoonful of ice cream. She thinks she is a complete failure for breaking her diet. She becomes so depressed that she ends up eating the whole quart of ice cream.<ref name=\"burns\" />\nThis example captures the polarized nature of this distortion--the person believes they are totally inadequate if they fall short of perfection. \nIn order to combat this distortion, Burns suggests thinking of the world in terms of shades of gray.<ref name=\"burns\" /> Rather than viewing herself as a complete failure for eating a spoonful of ice cream, the girl in the example could still recognize her overall effort to diet as at least a partial success.\n\n=== Overgeneralizing ===\nMaking [[hasty generalization]]s from insufficient evidence. Seeing a \u201csingle negative event\u201d as a \u201cnever-ending pattern of defeat.\"<ref name=\"burns\" /> Drawing a very broad conclusion from a single incident or a single piece of evidence. Even if something bad happens only once, it is expected to happen over and over again.<ref name=\"grohol\" />\n* Example 1: A young woman is asked out on a first date, but not a second one. She is distraught as she tells her friend, \u201cThis always happens to me! I\u2019ll never find love!\u201d\n* Example 2: A woman is lonely and often spends most of her time at home. Her friends sometimes ask her to dinner and to meet new people. She feels it is useless to even try. No one really could like her. And anyway, all people are the same; petty and selfish.<ref name=\"about\">{{cite web|last=Schimelpfening|first=Nancy|title=You Are What You Think|url=http://depression.about.com/cs/psychotherapy/a/cognitive.htm}}</ref>\nOne suggestion to combat this distortion is to \u201cExamine the Evidence\u201d by performing an accurate analysis of one\u2019s situation. This aids in avoiding exaggerating one\u2019s circumstances.<ref name=\"burns\" />\n\n=== Filtering === \nFiltering distortions occur when an individual dwells only on the negative details of a situation and filters out the positive aspects.<ref name=\"burns\" />\n* Example: Andy gets mostly compliments and positive feedback about a presentation he has done at work, but he also has received a small piece of criticism. For several days following his presentation, Andy dwells on this one negative reaction, forgetting all of the positive reactions that he had also been given.<ref name=\"burns\" />\n''The Feeling Good Handbook'' notes that filtering is like a \u201cdrop of ink that discolors a beaker of water.\"<ref name=\"burns\" /> One suggestion to combat filtering is a cost-benefit analysis. A person with this distortion may want to sit down and assess whether filtering out the positive and focusing on the negative is helping or hurting them in the long run.<ref name=\"burns\" />\n\n=== Disqualifying the positive===\nDisqualifying the positive refers to rejecting positive experiences by insisting they \"don't count\" for some reason or other. Negative belief is maintained despite contradiction by everyday experiences. Disqualifying the positive may be the most common fallacy in the cognitive distortion range; it is often analyzed with \"always being right\", a type of distortion where a person is in an all-or-nothing self-judgment. People in this situation show signs of depression.\n*Examples:\n*\"I will never be as good as Jane\"\n*\"Anyone could have done as well\"<ref name=\"burns\" />\n*\"They are just congratulating me to be nice\"<ref>{{cite web |website=Palomar |url=https://www2.palomar.edu/users/jtagg/disqual.htm|title=Disqualifying the Positive |accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Jumping to conclusions ===\n{{Main|Jumping to conclusions}}\nReaching preliminary conclusions (usually negative) with little (if any) evidence. Two specific subtypes are identified:\n* '''Mind reading:''' [[Inference|Inferring]] a person's possible or probable (usually negative) thoughts from his or her [[behavior]] and [[nonverbal communication]]; taking precautions against the worst suspected case without asking the person.\n** Example 1: A student assumes that the readers of his or her paper have already made up their minds concerning its topic, and, therefore, writing the paper is a pointless exercise.<ref name=\"tagg\" />\n** Example 2: Kevin assumes that because he sits alone at lunch, everyone else must think he is a loser. (This can encourage self-fulfilling prophecy; Kevin may not initiate social contact because of his fear that those around him already perceive him negatively).<ref>{{cite web |title=Cognitive Distortions: Jumping to Conclusions & All or Nothing Thinking |url=https://www.getmoodfit.com/single-post/2016/12/22/Cognitive-Distortions-Jumping-to-Conclusions-All-or-Nothing-Thinking |website=Moodfit |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> \n* '''Fortune-telling:''' predicting outcomes (usually negative) of events\n** Example : A depressed person tells themselves they will never improve; they will continue to be depressed for their whole life.<ref name=\"burns\" />\nOne way to combat this distortion is to ask, \u201cIf this is true, does it say more about me or them?<ref>{{cite web |title=Common Cognitive Distortions: Mind Reading |url=http://cogbtherapy.com/cbt-blog/common-cognitive-distortions-mind-reading |website=Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - Los Angeles |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>\u201d \n\n=== Magnification and minimization ===\n{{Main|Exaggeration|Minimisation (psychology)}}\nGiving proportionally greater weight to a perceived failure, weakness or threat, or lesser weight to a perceived success, strength or opportunity, so that the weight differs from that assigned by others, such as \"[[make a mountain out of a molehill|making a mountain out of a molehill]]\". In depressed clients, often the positive characteristics of ''other people'' are exaggerated and their negative characteristics are understated.\n* ''[[Catastrophizing]]'' \u2013 Giving greater weight to the worst possible outcome, however unlikely, or experiencing a situation as unbearable or impossible when it is just uncomfortable\n\n=== Emotional reasoning ===\n{{Main|Emotional reasoning}}\nIn the emotional reasoning distortion, it is assumed that feelings expose the true nature of things and experience reality as a reflection of emotionally linked thoughts; something is believed true solely based on a feeling.\n* Examples: \"I feel stupid, therefore I must be stupid\".<ref name=\"grohol\" /> Feeling fear of flying in planes, and then concluding that planes must be a dangerous way to travel.<ref name=\"burns\" /> Feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of cleaning one's house, therefore concluding that it's hopeless to even start cleaning.<ref name=\"about\" /> \n\n=== Making \"must\" or \"should\" statements ===\n[[Rational emotive behavior therapy#Core beliefs that disturb humans|Making \"must\" or \"should\" statements]] was included by [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] in his [[Rational emotive behavior therapy|rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT)]], an early form of CBT; he termed it \"musturbation\". Michael C. Graham called it \"expecting the world to be different than it is\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=37}}</ref> It can be seen as demanding particular achievements or behaviors regardless of the realistic circumstances of the situation. \n* Example: After a performance, a concert pianist believes he or she should not have made so many mistakes.<ref name=\"about\" />\n* In ''Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy'', David Burns clearly distinguished between pathological \"should statements\", moral imperatives, and social norms.\nA related cognitive distortion, also present in Ellis' REBT, is a tendency to \"[[Rational emotive behavior therapy#Core beliefs that disturb humans|awfulize]]\"; to say a future scenario will be awful, rather than to realistically appraise the various negative and positive characteristics of that scenario.\nAccording to Burns, \u201cmust\u2019 and \u201cshould\u201d statements are negative because they cause the person to feel guilty and upset at themselves. Some people also direct this distortion at other people, which can cause feelings of anger and frustration when that other person does not do what they \u201cshould\u201d have done. He also mentions how this type of thinking can lead to rebellious thoughts. In other words, trying to whip oneself into doing something with \u201cshoulds\u201d may cause one to desire just the opposite.<ref name=\"burns\" />\n\n===Personalization and Blaming ===\n{{Main|Blaming}}\nPersonalization is assigning personal blame disproportionate to the level of control a person realistically has in a given situation. \n* Example 1: A foster child assumes that he/she has not been adopted because he/she is not \u201cloveable enough.\u201d \n* Example 2: A child has bad grades. His/her mother believes it is because she is not a good enough parent.<ref name=\"burns\" />\nBlaming is the opposite of personalization. In the blaming distortion, the disproportionate level of blame is placed upon other people, rather than oneself.<ref name=\"burns\" /> In this way, the person avoids taking personal responsibility, making way for a \u201cvictim mentality.\u201d \n* Example: Placing blame for marital problems entirely on one\u2019s spouse.<ref name=\"burns\" />\n\n===Always being right===\nIn this cognitive distortion, being wrong is unthinkable. This distortion is characterized by actively trying to prove one's actions or thoughts to be correct, and sometimes prioritizing [[Self|self-interest]] over the feelings of another person.<ref name=\"grohol\" />. In this Cognitive Distortion, the facts that oneself has about its surroundings are always right while other people opinions and perspectives are wrongly seen <ref>{{cite web |website=PsychCentral |title=15 Common Cognitive Distortions |date=2016-05-17 |url=https://psychcentral.com/lib/15-common-cognitive-distortions/ |accessdate=2020-02-28}}</ref> \n\n===Fallacy of change===\nRelying on [[social control]] to obtain cooperative actions from another person<ref name=\"grohol\" /> The underlying assumption of this thinking style is that one's happiness depends on the actions of others. The fallacy of change also assumes that other people should change to suit one's own interests automatically and/or that it is fair to pressure them to change. It may be present in most abusive relationships in which partners' \"visions\" of each other are tied into the belief that happiness, love, trust, and perfection would just occur once they or the other person change aspects of their beings.<ref>{{cite web |website=Abate Counseling |url=http://abatecounselling.ie/2018/08/30/fallacy-of-change-15-types-of-distorted-thinking-that-lead-to-massive-anxiety-10-15/|title=Fallacy of Change: 15 types of distorted thinking that lead to massive anxiety 10/15|date=2018-08-30}}</ref>\n\n===Fallacy of fairness===\nFallacy of fairness is the belief that life should be fair. When life is perceived to be unfair, an angry emotional state is produced which may lead to attempts to correct the situation.<ref name=\"grohol\" /> There are few situations in which \"universal justice\" can be applied or excluded. Justice comes from the late Old English justice \u2018administration of the law\u2019, fairness and justice do not vary between culture, people, or country, it is seen that they need to be attributed in any situation.<ref>{{cite web |website=Real Clear Politics |url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/02/09/the_fallacy_of_fairness__100219.html|title=Fallacy of Change: 15 types of distorted thinking that lead to massive anxiety 10/15}}</ref>\n\n=== Labeling and mislabeling ===\n{{Main|Labeling theory}}\nA form of overgeneralization; attributing a person's actions to his or her character instead of to an attribute. Rather than assuming the behaviour to be accidental or otherwise extrinsic, one assigns a label to someone or something that is based on the inferred character of that person or thing.\n\n== Cognitive restructuring ==\n[[Cognitive restructuring]] (CR) is a popular form of therapy used to identify and reject maladaptive cognitive distortions<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gil |first=Pedro J.

For example, a depressed male college student who experiences difficulty in dating might believe that his \"worthlessness\" causes women to reject him. Together, therapist and client might then create a more realistic cognition, e.g., \"It is within my control to ask girls on dates. However, even though there are some things I can do to influence their decisions, whether or not they say yes is largely out of my control.

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]].

The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda.

Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989_FIAT_Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions &mdash; with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989_Fiat_Panda_4x4_SISLEY_(3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors &mdash;in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox &mdash; with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time. \n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n*The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n*The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n*The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n*The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n*The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n*The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n\n*The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n*The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n*The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n*The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n\n*'''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989_FIAT_Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions &mdash; with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989_Fiat_Panda_4x4_SISLEY_(3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors &mdash;in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox &mdash; with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time. \n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

In its development phase, the Panda was intended to be called \"Gingo\", but Renault objected because it sounded too close to their Twingo.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe second generation replaced the old Panda after 23 years of production. Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n*The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n*The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n*The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n*The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n*The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n*The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n\n*The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n*The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n*The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n*The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com }}</ref>\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n\n*'''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n\n*'''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The video for a romantic song on the album, \"Aasman Ke\", features the singer and [[South Indian people|south Indian]] model [[Suhasi Goradia Dhami]]. \"Humsafar\", the title track, has an interplay of English and [[Hindi]] [[lyrics]] and is about one's conscience and how it is a constant companion in the journey of life. One of the songs, \"Yeh Kahan Mil Gaye Hum\", was penned seven years before the release. \"Dekho Na\", a rock number, was written six years prior. The remaining six songs were developed in the last two years before the release. Other songs in the album include \"Rain Bhai Kaari (Maajhi)\", a mix of Bengali [[Baul]] with rock with a tinge of [[S D Burman]], and \"Cineraria\", a fun-filled English ballad. KK himself wrote the lyrics of \"Cineraria\" and the English part of \"Humsafar\", the title track, while the remaining tracks were written by others.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plain rowheaders\"\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n| scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Album(s)\n| length=\"col\" | Music Director(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Solo Albums\n|-\n| 1999\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Pal (album)|Pal]]''\n| [[Lesle Lewis (composer)|Lesle Lewis]]\n|-\n| 2008\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Humsafar (album)|Humsafar]]''\n| KK\n|-\n! colspan=\"6\"  | Compilations\n|-\n| 2002\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Humraaz]]''\n| [[Himesh Reshammiya]]\n|-\n| 2010\n! scope=\"row\" | ''Kavalan\n| KK, Rita{{clarify|date=May 2016}}\n|-\n| 2011\n!

The helix-turn-helix motif is shown in deep red.]]\n'''Tet Repressor proteins''' (otherwise known as '''TetR''') are proteins playing an important role in conferring [[antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]] to large categories of bacterial species. \n\n[[Tetracycline]] (tc) is a broad family of antibiotics to which bacteria have evolved resistance. Tc normally kills bacteria by binding to the bacterial [[ribosome]] and halting protein synthesis. The expression of tc resistance genes is regulated by Tet Repressor Protein. More specifically, TetR represses the expression of TetA, a membrane protein that pumps out substances toxic to the bacteria like tc, by binding the TetA [[Operator (biology)|operator]].<ref name=\"Ramos_2005\" /> In tc resistant bacteria, TetA will pump out tc before it can bind to the ribosome because the repressive action of TetR on TetA is halted by binding of tc to TetR.<ref name = \"Ramos_2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramos JL, Mart\u00ednez-Bueno M, Molina-Henares AJ, Ter\u00e1n W, Watanabe K, Zhang X, Gallegos MT, Brennan R, Tobes R | display-authors = 6 | title = The TetR family of transcriptional repressors | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 326\u201356 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15944459 | pmc = 1197418 | doi = 10.1128/mmbr.69.2.326-356.2005 }}</ref> Therefore, TetR may have an important role  in helping scientists to better understand mechanisms of [[Antibiotic resistant|antibiotic resistance]] and how to treat antibiotic resistant bacteria. TetR is one of many proteins in the TetR [[protein family]], which is so named because TetR is the most well characterized member.\n\nTetR is used in artificially engineered [[gene regulatory network]]s because of its capacity for fine regulation. In the absence of tc, basal expression of TetR is very low, but expression rises sharply in the presence of even a minute quantity of tc through a positive feedback mechanism. TetA is also present in the widely used E. coli cloning vector [[pBR322]] (where the sequence that confers resistance, containing only the TetA gene,<ref name=\"Allard1992\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Allard JD, Bertrand KP | title = Membrane topology of the pBR322 tetracycline resistance protein.

HTH motif shown in pink -note conformational change.]]\nTetR functions as a [[Protein dimer|homodimer]].<ref name=\"Ramos_2005\" /> Each monomer consists of ten [[Alpha helix|alpha helices]] connected by loops and turns. The overall structure of TetR can be broken down into two DNA-binding domains (one per monomer) and a regulatory core, which is responsible for tetracycline recognition and dimerization. TetR dimerizes by making hydrophobic contacts within the regulatory core. There is a binding cavity for tetracycline in the outer helices of the regulatory domain. When tetracycline binds this cavity, it causes a conformational change that affects the DNA-binding domain so that TetR is no longer able to bind DNA. As a result, TetA and TetR are expressed. There is still some debate in the field whether tetracycline derivatives alone can cause this conformational change or whether tetracycline must be in complex with magnesium to bind TetR.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Werten S, Dalm D, Palm GJ, Grimm CC, Hinrichs W | title = Tetracycline repressor allostery does not depend on divalent metal recognition | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 53 | issue = 50 | pages = 7990\u20138 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25432019 | doi = 10.1021/bi5012805 }}</ref> (TetR typically binds tetracycline-Mg<sup>2+</sup> complexes inside bacteria, but TetR binding to tetracycline alone has been observed in vitro.)  \n[[File:TetR-DNAcomplex (2).png|left|thumb|TetR (purple and salmon) in complex with its target DNA sequence.

Tc normally kills bacteria by binding to the bacterial [[ribosome]] and halting protein synthesis. The expression of tc resistance genes is regulated by Tet Repressor Protein. More specifically, TetR represses the expression of TetA, a membrane protein that pumps out substances toxic to the bacteria like tc, by binding the TetA [[Operator (biology)|operator]].<ref name=\"Ramos_2005\" /> In tc resistant bacteria, TetA will pump out tc before it can bind to the ribosome because the repressive action of TetR on TetA is halted by binding of tc to TetR.<ref name = \"Ramos_2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramos JL, Mart\u00ednez-Bueno M, Molina-Henares AJ, Ter\u00e1n W, Watanabe K, Zhang X, Gallegos MT, Brennan R, Tobes R | display-authors = 6 | title = The TetR family of transcriptional repressors | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 326\u201356 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15944459 | pmc = 1197418 | doi = 10.1128/mmbr.69.2.326-356.2005 }}</ref> Therefore, TetR may have an important role  in helping scientists to better understand mechanisms of [[Antibiotic resistant|antibiotic resistance]] and how to treat antibiotic resistant bacteria.

In the absence of tc, basal expression of TetR is very low, but expression rises sharply in the presence of even a minute quantity of tc through a positive feedback mechanism.

The overall structure of TetR can be broken down into two DNA-binding domains (one per monomer) and a regulatory core, which is responsible for tetracycline recognition and dimerization. TetR dimerizes by making hydrophobic contacts within the regulatory core. There is a binding cavity for tetracycline in the outer helices of the regulatory domain. When tetracycline binds this cavity, it causes a conformational change that affects the DNA-binding domain so that TetR is no longer able to bind DNA. As a result, TetA and TetR are expressed.

He was famous for his wide-brimmed maroon hat which he wore in preference to a helmet against even the fastest bowlers. Richardson captained the West Indies in 24 Tests between 1991 when he took over from [[Viv Richards]] and 1995, winning 11, losing 6, and the rest ending in draws.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2mRjVQ9C9YwC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22Richie+Richardson%22&source=bl&ots=g_RKZHHM8K&sig=tpxfkGn5NsH3E1XlpfXu0OjzEd0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yaQnUODqCejJ0QWUroHwDw&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Richardson&f=false |title=The Development of West Indies Cricket, Vol. 2: The Age of Nationalism |author=[[Hilary Beckles]] |year=1998 |page=201}}</ref>\n\n==Early days==\nRichardson was born in [[Five Islands, Antigua and Barbuda|Five Islands Village]], [[Antigua]]. He began his career with the [[Leeward Islands cricket team|Leewards Islands]] in 1982 as an opener.\n\n==International career==\nAfter his second season he was called up by the West Indies to tour India in the 1983\u201384 season. Richardson joined a successful West Indies Test team captained by [[Clive Lloyd]] batting in the middle order. His first tour started inauspiciously when Richardson lost his luggage and was left with few clothes. Veteran fast bowler [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]] felt that Richardson was not getting enough practice as in the nets even bowlers were given a chance to bat ahead of him and by the time Richardson had an opportunity the main bowlers had finished. Roberts went out of his way to bowl at Richardson during the tour to make sure he had some preparation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/576267.html|title='If I write a book, a lot of people will get hurt'| publisher= ESPN Cricinfo| date=9 August 2012| accessdate= 11 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 November 1983, Richardson debuted in the fourth match of the six-Test series, at which point the West Indies had a 2\u20130 lead, replacing [[Gus Logie]] who had bagged a pair in the previous Test. In his first innings Richardson too failed to score a run when was the victim of a poor umpiring decision. He was given out [[leg before wicket]] off the bowling oof off-spinner [[Shivlal Yadav]] though he had hit the ball.

Every day was stressful, everybody wanted a piece of you and I had no time for myself. I was training harder and trying hard on the field but I couldn't do what I wanted to do.

In 2006 he smashed a double hundred with included four sixes of a hapless Robert Saunders over. Since 2001 he has also played bass guitar in [[reggae]] band Big Bad Dread and The Baldhead, alongside [[Curtly Ambrose]] and the band has released several albums.<ref name=\"BBC website 4th April

[[cricket]]er and a former [[captain (cricket)|captain]] of the West Indian cricket team.\n\nHe was a flamboyant batsman and superb player of [[fast bowling]]. He was famous for his wide-brimmed maroon hat which he wore in preference to a helmet against even the fastest bowlers. Richardson captained the West Indies in 24 Tests between 1991 when he took over from [[Viv Richards]] and 1995, winning 11, losing 6, and the rest ending in draws.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2mRjVQ9C9YwC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22Richie+Richardson%22&source=bl&ots=g_RKZHHM8K&sig=tpxfkGn5NsH3E1XlpfXu0OjzEd0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yaQnUODqCejJ0QWUroHwDw&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Richardson&f=false |title=The Development of West Indies Cricket, Vol. 2: The Age of Nationalism |author=[[Hilary Beckles]] |year=1998 |page=201}}</ref>\n\n==Early days==\nRichardson was born in [[Five Islands, Antigua and Barbuda | Five Islands Village]], [[Antigua]]. He began his career with the [[Leeward Islands cricket team|Leewards Islands]] in 1982 as an opener. \n\n==International career==\nAfter his second season he was called up by the West Indies to tour India in the 1983\u201384 season. Richardson joined a successful West Indies Test team captained by [[Clive Lloyd]] batting in the middle order. His first tour started inauspiciously when Richardson lost his luggage and was left with few clothes. Veteran fast bowler [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]] felt that Richardson was not getting enough practice as in the nets even bowlers were given a chance to bat ahead of him and by the time Richardson had an opportunity the main bowlers had finished. Roberts went out of his way to bowl at Richardson during the tour to make sure he had some preparation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/576267.html|title='If I write a book, a lot of people will get hurt'| publisher= ESPN Cricinfo| date=9 August 2012| accessdate= 11 August 2012}}</ref> \n\nOn 24 November 1983, Richardson debuted in the fourth match of the six-Test series, at which point the West Indies had a 2\u20130 lead, replacing [[Gus Logie]] who had bagged a pair in the previous Test. In his first innings Richardson too failed to score a run when was the victim of a poor umpiring decision. He was given out [[leg before wicket]] off the bowling oof off-spinner [[Shivlal Yadav]] though he had hit the ball. He was more successful in the second innings, making 26 before he was bowled, and the match ended in a draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/77221.html|title=Richie Richardson: My First Test | publisher= ESPN Cricinfo| date=9 October 1988| accessdate= 11 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===1985 World Championship of Cricket=== \nAustralia hosted the [[World Championship of Cricket]] in February and March 1985 to commemorate the founding of Victoria. During the group stages the West Indies faced [[Sri Lankan national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] on a pitch with uneven bounce. Though the West Indies won the match, a delivery from [[Ashantha de Mel]] reared and hit Richardson in the face; with [[Larry Gomes]], he was one of two West Indian batsmen to retire hurt during the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/266958.html|title=The coach who caught Sachin, and a much-travelled man| author=Steven Lynch| publisher= ESPN Cricinfo| date=5 November 2006| accessdate= 12 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Captaincy===\nLate in 1991, West Indies captain [[Viv Richards]] informed the [[West Indies Cricket Board]] of his intention to relinquish the Test captaincy and retire after the [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]]. Though Richards had publicly picked [[Desmond Haynes]] as his successor, the board chose Richardson to take over the captaincy and Richards was dropped from the team.

In the group stages the West Indies suffered a shock defeat at the hands of [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]], prompting the Caribbean media to call for Richardson's resignation.

Every day was stressful, everybody wanted a piece of you and I had no time for myself. I was training harder and trying hard on the field but I couldn't do what I wanted to do. I felt like I was selling myself and my fans short.

In 2006 he smashed a double hundred with included four sixes of a hapless Robert Saunders over.

{"title_page": "George Washington and slavery", "text_new": "[[File:GW-painting.jpg|thumb|right|''George Washington'' ([[John Trumbull]], 1780), with [[William Lee (valet)|William Lee]], Washington's enslaved personal servant|alt=painting]]\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2016}}\n\n'''George Washington''' was a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father of the United States]] and slaveowner who became uneasy with the institution of slavery but provided for the emancipation of his slaves only after his death. [[Slavery in the colonial United States|Slavery]] was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]], and [[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding increased through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practice at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery were entirely economic, prompted by his transition from tobacco to grain crops in the 1760's which left him with a costly surplus of slaves. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept African-Americans, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783 betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered plans in the mid 1790s to free all the slaves he controlled, but they could not be realized because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do so. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and people of African descent in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 people of African descent, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage.

This was replaced in 1792 by brick-built accommodation wings either side of the greenhouse comprising four rooms in total, each of some {{convert|600|sqft|m2}}. The [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]] have concluded these rooms were communal areas furnished with bunks that allowed little privacy for the predominantly male occupants. Other slaves at Mansion House Farm lived over the outbuildings where they worked or in log cabins.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162\u2013164, 166\u2013167</ref> Such cabins were the standard slave accommodation at the outlying farms, comparable to the accommodation occupied by the lower strata of free white society across the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake area]] and by slaves on other Virginia plantations.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162, 167, 169</ref> They provided a single room that ranged in size from 168 square feet (15.6 m2) to 246 square feet (22.9 m2) to house a family.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168\u2013169</ref> The cabins were often poorly constructed, daubed with mud for draft- and water-proofing, with dirt floors. Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved on carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smoky, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them the tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate. There is evidence in the historical record from 1797 that Mount Vernon slaves had contacts with [[Baptists]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quakers]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 208\u2013209</ref> The three religions advocated abolition, raising hopes of freedom among the slaves, and the congregation of the Alexandria Baptist Church, founded in 1803, included slaves formerly owned by Washington.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 209, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Mulattoes===\nIn 1799 there were some twenty [[mulatto]] (mixed race) slaves at Mount Vernon. The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with the slaves they supervised.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]]. A case made by the historian Henry Wiencek is, according to the historian Philip Morgan, \"so circumstantial as to be fanciful,\" and there is no evidence that Washington ever met Venus, let alone fathered a child by her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 147\u2013151</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 419, 420 n26</ref>}}\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Oney Judge Runaway Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement placed in the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' after Oney Judge absconded from the President's House in 1796|alt=Newspaper clipping]]\nThe frequent comments Washington made about \"rogueries\" and \"old tricks\" indicate the resistance displayed by the slaves against the system.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 261</ref> The most common act of resistance was theft, so common that Washington made allowances for it as part of normal wastage. Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally. In one case, Washington suspected a slave of frequently avoiding work over a period of decades through acts of deliberate self harm.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 261\u2013263, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nSlaves asserted some independence and frustrated Washington by the pace and quality of their work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 105, 265</ref> In 1760, Washington noted that four of his carpenters quadrupled their output of timber under his personal supervision.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 93\u201394</ref> Thirty-five years later, he described his carpenters as an \"idle...set of rascals\" who would take a month or more to complete at Mount Vernon work that was being done in two or three days in [[Philadelphia]]. The output of seamstresses dropped off when Martha was away, and spinners found they could slacken by playing the overseers off against her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Tools were regularly lost or damaged, thus stopping work, and Washington despaired of employing innovations that might improve efficiency because he believed the slaves were too clumsy to operate the new machinery involved.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266, 268</ref>\n\nThe most emphatic act of resistance was to run away, and between 1760 and 1799 at least forty-seven slaves under Washington's control did so.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 275</ref> Seventeen of these, fourteen men and three women, escaped to a British warship that anchored in the [[Potomac River]] near Mount Vernon in 1781.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 278, 279</ref> In general, the best chance of success lay with second- or third-generation African-American slaves who had good English, possessed skills that would allow them to support themselves as free people and were in close enough contact with their masters to receive special privileges. Thus it was that Judge, an especially talented seamstress, and Hercules escaped in 1796 and 1797 respectively and eluded recapture.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 281, 284\u2013286</ref> Washington took seriously the recapture of fugitives, and in three cases an escaped slave was sold off in the West Indies after recapture, effectively a death sentence in the severe conditions slaves had to endure there.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\">Wiencek 2003 p. 132</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 411\u2013412</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 161</ref>\n\n===Control===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=Slavery was a system in which enslaved people lived in fear; fear of being sold, fear of being separated from their families or their children or their parents, fear of not being in control of their bodies or their lives, fear of never knowing freedom.

By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry.

The more valuable married males were raffled together with their wives and children; less valuable slaves were separated from their families into different lots. Robin and Bella, for example, were raffled together as husband and wife while their children, twelve-year-old Sukey and seven-year-old Betty, were listed in a separate lot.

The single pre-1788 pamphlet of the six in ''Tracts on Slavery'' was ''A Serious Address to the Rulers of America, on the Inconsistency of Their Conduct Respecting Slavery'', published in 1783. It was the first pamphlet in the volume, and Washington had written his signature on the cover, as he did with the first pamphlet in each of the thirty-six volumes. Of the eleven pamphlets on slavery that were, presumably, not considered to be worth binding, eight were published before 1788. One of them, published in 1785, was never read.

On returning to France, Lafayette purchased a plantation in the French colony of Cayenne, modern-day [[French Guiana]], and advised Washington of his progress by letter in 1786. Lafayette had taken concerns about the abrupt emancipation of slaves into account, paying and educating the slaves he settled on the plantation before freeing them. He became a leading figure in the French movement against the slave trade and a corresponding member of the British movement. Washington would not have known of Lafayette's antislavery activities in Cayenne or Europe from Lafayette himself; although the two continued to correspond for the rest of Washington's life, the subject of slavery virtually disappeared from their letters.

He presided over the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, during which it became obvious just how explosive the issue was and how willing the antislavery faction was to accept the preservation of slavery to ensure national unity and the establishment of a strong federal government. The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country.

A passage in the notebook of Washington's biographer [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]]{{efn|Humphreys was a former aide to Washington and had begun an eighteen-month stay at Mount Vernon in 1787 to assist Washington with his correspondence and write his biography.<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 153</ref>}} dated to late 1788 or early 1789 recorded a statement that resembled the emancipation clause in Washington's will a decade later. Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves. It marks, Wiencek believes, a moral epiphany in Washington's thinking, the moment he decided not only to emancipate his slaves but also to use the occasion to set the example Lafayette had urged in 1783.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\">Wiencek 2003 pp. 272\u2013275</ref> Other historians dispute Wiencek's conclusion; Henriques and [[Joseph Ellis]] concur with Philip Morgan's opinion that Washington experienced no epiphanies in a \"long and hard-headed struggle\" in which there was no single turning point. Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests. No state considered making slavery an issue during the ratification of the new constitution, southern states reinforced their slavery legislation and prominent antislavery figures were muted about the issue in public. Washington understood there was little widespread organized support for abolition.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 125\u2013126</ref> He had a keen sense both of the fragility of the fledgling Republic and of his place as a unifying figure, and he was determined not to endanger either by confronting an issue as divisive and entrenched as slavery.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 126\u2013128</ref><ref>Morgan 2000 pp. 290, 295</ref> He was president of a government that passed a resolution in 1790 affirming states' rights to regulate treatment of slaves and legislate on slavery free of congressional interference, provided materiel and financial support for French efforts to suppress the [[Haitian Revolution|Saint Domingue slave revolt]] in 1791 and implemented the proslavery [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]].<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 275\u2013276</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 p. 130</ref><ref name=Morgan2000-297>Morgan 2000 p. 297</ref> He also signed into law the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]] that sought to limit American involvement in the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]].<ref>Stathis 2014 pp. 17\u201318</ref> Washington never spoke publicly on the issue of slavery during his eight years as president, nor did he respond to, much less act upon, any of the antislavery petitions he received. He described a 1790 Quaker petition to [[United States Congress|Congress]] urging an immediate end to the slave trade as \"an illjudged piece of business\" that \"occasioned a great waste of time.\" The issue of slavery was not mentioned in either his last address to Congress or his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 126</ref><ref>Boller 1961 pp. 85, 87</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 p. 363</ref>\n\nLate in his presidency, Washington told his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Edmund Randolph]], that in the event of a confrontation between North and South, he had \"made up his mind to remove and be of the Northern.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 362</ref> In 1798, he imagined just such a conflict when he said, \"I can clearly foresee that nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 361\u2013362</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\"/> But there is no indication Washington ever favored an immediate end to slavery. His abolitionist aspirations for the nation were confined to the hope that slavery would disappear naturally over time with the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibition of slave imports]] in 1808, the earliest date such legislation could be passed as agreed at the Constitutional Convention.<ref name=Twohig131 /><ref>Morgan 2000 p. 296</ref>\n\n====As Virginia farmer====\nIn addition to political caution, economic imperatives remained an important consideration with regard to Washington's personal position as a slaveholder and his efforts to free himself from his dependency on slavery.<ref name=Twohig128>Twohig 2001 p. 128</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p423>Morgan 2005 p. 423</ref> He was one of the largest debtors in Virginia at the end of the war,<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 92</ref> and by 1787 the business at Mount Vernon had failed to make a profit for more than a decade.

This plan would have involved breaking up slave families, but it was designed with an end goal of raising enough finances to fund their eventual emancipation (a detail Washington kept secret) and prevent the Custis heirs from permanently splitting up families by sale.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 339\u2013342</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 303\u2013304</ref>{{efn|The dower slaves had already begun to be transferred to Martha's granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.

Peter had begun selling off slaves soon after his marriage, splitting up families and systematically separating girls as young as four years old from their parents. Wiencek suggests Martha's servant [[Oney Judge|Ona Judge]], who as a dower slave was destined to become Custis property, fled from Philadelphia in 1796 to avoid being sold.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 338\u2013342</ref>}} None of these schemes could be realized because of his failure to sell or rent land at the right prices, the refusal of the Custis heirs to agree to them and his own reluctance to separate families.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 423\u2013424</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 342</ref> Wiencek speculates that, because Washington gave such serious consideration to freeing his slaves knowing full well the political ramifications that would follow, one of his goals was to make a public statement that would sway opinion towards abolition.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 342\u2013343</ref> Philip Morgan argues that Washington freeing his slaves while President in 1794 or 1796 would have had no profound effect, and would have been greeted with public silence and private derision by white southerners.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 428\u2013429</ref>\n\nAs Washington subordinated his desire for emancipation to his efforts to secure financial independence, he took care to retain his slaves.<ref>Ellis 2004 pp. 258\u2013260</ref> In 1791, he arranged for those who served in his personal retinue while he was President in Philadelphia to be rotated out of the state before they became eligible for emancipation after six months residence per [[An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery|Pennsylvanian law]]. Not only would Washington have been deprived of their services if they were freed, most of the slaves he took with him to Philadelphia were dower slaves, which meant that he would have had to compensate the Custis estate for the loss. Because of his concerns for his public image and that the prospect of emancipation would generate discontent among the slaves before they became eligible for emancipation, he instructed that they be shuffled back to Mount Vernon \"under pretext that may deceive both them and the Public.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 59\u201360</ref>\n\nWashington spared no expense in efforts to recover Hercules and Judge when they absconded. In Judge's case, Washington persisted for three years.

In the months that followed, he considered a plan that betrayed a continuing prioritization of profit above his concerns about the institution of slavery. The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families. The plan died with Washington on December 14, 1799.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 404, 424</ref>{{efn|Philip Morgan speculates on the unlikely possibility that, had the plan proved profitable, Washington might have changed his will and retracted the manumission of his slaves.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 425</ref>}}\n\nWashington's slaves were the subjects of the longest provisions in the twenty-nine-page will, taking three pages in which his instructions were more forceful than in the rest of the document. His valet, William Lee, was freed immediately and his remaining 123 slaves were to be emancipated on the death of Martha.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 5</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> The deferral was intended to postpone the pain of separation that would occur when his slaves were freed but their spouses among the dower slaves remained in bondage, a situation which affected twenty couples and their children. It is possible Washington hoped Martha and her heirs who would inherit the dower slaves would solve this problem by following his example and emancipating them.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 354</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 216</ref><ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\"/> Those too old or infirm to work were to be supported by his estate, as mandated by state law. Washington went beyond the legal requirement to support and maintain younger slaves until adulthood, stipulating that those children whose education could not be undertaken by parents were to be taught reading, writing and a useful trade by their masters and then be freed at the age of twenty-five.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 294</ref> Washington was particularly pointed in forbidding the sale or transportation of any of his slaves out of Virginia before their emancipation.<ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> Including the Dandridge slaves, who were emancipated under similar terms, more than 160 slaves were freed.<ref name=\"Morgan2005pp404\u2013405\" /><ref name=gwpapers /> Although he was not alone among Virginian slaveowners in freeing their slaves, he was the only Founding Father to do so.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 427</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Slave Memorial - Mt.

By 1812, Free Town in [[Truro Parish, Virginia|Truro Parish]], the earliest known free African-American settlement in Fairfax County, contained seven households of former Washington slaves. By the mid 1800s, a son of Washington's carpenter Davy Jones and two grandsons of his [[postilion]] Joe Richardson had each bought land in Virginia. Francis Lee, younger brother of William, was well known and respected enough to have his obituary printed in the ''Alexandria Gazette'' on his death at Mount Vernon in 1821.

[[Slavery in the colonial United States|Slavery]] was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]], and [[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding increased through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practice at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery were entirely economic, prompted by his transition from tobacco to grain crops in the 1760's which left him with a costly surplus of slaves. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept African-Americans, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed his distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783 betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered plans in the mid 1790s to free all the slaves he controlled, but they could not be realized because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do so. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and people of African descent in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 people of African descent, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage. Augustine was a tobacco planter with some {{convert|10,000|acre|ha}} of land and 50 slaves. On his death in 1743, he left his {{convert|2,500|acre|ha|adj=on}} Little Hunting Creek to George's older half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence]], who renamed it [[Mount Vernon]].

Horses and mules were bred in stables there, and tropical plants were grown in a greenhouse. Trades such as blacksmithing, carpentry, barrel making (coopering), food production and preservation, spinning, weaving and shoe making were carried out in other buildings at Mansion House Farm. Some crops were grown at this farm, but the main agricultural business was conducted at the four outlying farms located in a radius of between {{convert|1+1/2|mi|km|spell=in}} and {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} from the mansion: Dogue Run Farm, Muddy Hole Farm, Union Farm (formed from the earlier Ferry Farm and French's Farm) and River Farm.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 4</ref> A farm manager responsible for the running of the estate reported directly to Washington, while an overseer was employed at each of the farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 78\u201379</ref>}}\n\n[[File:A Map of Washington's Farms at Mt.

Other slaves at Mansion House Farm lived over the outbuildings where they worked or in log cabins.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162\u2013164, 166\u2013167</ref> Such cabins were the standard slave accommodation at the outlying farms, comparable to the accommodation occupied by the lower strata of free white society across the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake area]] and by slaves on other Virginia plantations.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162, 167, 169</ref> They provided a single room that ranged in size from 168 square feet (15.6 m2) to 246 square feet (22.9 m2) to house a family.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168\u2013169</ref> The cabins were often poorly constructed, daubed with mud for draft- and water-proofing, with dirt floors. Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved on carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smoky, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them the tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate. There is evidence in the historical record from 1797 that Mount Vernon slaves had contacts with [[Baptists]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quakers]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 208\u2013209</ref> The three religions advocated abolition, raising hopes of freedom among the slaves, and the congregation of the Alexandria Baptist Church, founded in 1803, included slaves formerly owned by Washington.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 209, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Mulattoes===\nIn 1799 there were some twenty [[mulatto]] (mixed race) slaves at Mount Vernon. The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with the slaves they supervised.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]]. A case made by the historian Henry Wiencek is, according to the historian Philip Morgan, \"so circumstantial as to be fanciful,\" and there is no evidence that Washington ever met Venus, let alone fathered a child by her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 147\u2013151</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 419, 420 n26</ref>}}\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Oney Judge Runaway Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement placed in the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' after Oney Judge absconded from the President's House in 1796|alt=Newspaper clipping]]\nThe frequent comments Washington made about \"rogueries\" and \"old tricks\" indicate the resistance displayed by the slaves against the system.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 261</ref> The most common act of resistance was theft, so common that Washington made allowances for it as part of normal wastage. Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally. In one case, Washington suspected a slave of frequently avoiding work over a period of decades through acts of deliberate self harm.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 261\u2013263, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nSlaves asserted some independence and frustrated Washington by the pace and quality of their work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 105, 265</ref> In 1760, Washington noted that four of his carpenters quadrupled their output of timber under his personal supervision.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 93\u201394</ref> Thirty-five years later, he described his carpenters as an \"idle...set of rascals\" who would take a month or more to complete at Mount Vernon work that was being done in two or three days in [[Philadelphia]]. The output of seamstresses dropped off when Martha was away, and spinners found they could slacken by playing the overseers off against her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Tools were regularly lost or damaged, thus stopping work, and Washington despaired of employing innovations that might improve efficiency because he believed the slaves were too clumsy to operate the new machinery involved.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266, 268</ref>\n\nThe most emphatic act of resistance was to run away, and between 1760 and 1799 at least forty-seven slaves under Washington's control did so.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 275</ref> Seventeen of these, fourteen men and three women, escaped to a British warship that anchored in the [[Potomac River]] near Mount Vernon in 1781.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 278, 279</ref> In general, the best chance of success lay with second- or third-generation African-American slaves who had good English, possessed skills that would allow them to support themselves as free people and were in close enough contact with their masters to receive special privileges. Thus it was that Judge, an especially talented seamstress, and Hercules escaped in 1796 and 1797 respectively and eluded recapture.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 281, 284\u2013286</ref> Washington took seriously the recapture of fugitives, and in three cases an escaped slave was sold off in the West Indies after recapture, effectively a death sentence in the severe conditions slaves had to endure there.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\">Wiencek 2003 p. 132</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 411\u2013412</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 161</ref>\n\n===Control===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=Slavery was a system in which enslaved people lived in fear; fear of being sold, fear of being separated from their families or their children or their parents, fear of not being in control of their bodies or their lives, fear of never knowing freedom.

And that was the psychological violence of slavery. That's how slave owners maintained control over enslaved people.\n|author=Jessie MacLeod<br/>Associate Curator<br/>George Washington's Mount Vernon<ref>MacLeod</ref>}}\nWashington used both reward and punishment to encourage discipline and productivity in his slaves.<ref name=Hirschfeld36>Hirschfeld p. 36</ref> In one case he suggested \"admonition and advice\" would be more effective than \"further correction\", and he occasionally appealed to a slave's sense of pride to encourage better performance. Rewards in the form of better blankets and clothing fabric were given to the \"most deserving\", and there are examples of cash payments being awarded for good behavior.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 259\u2013260</ref> He opposed the use of the lash in principle, but saw the practice as a necessary evil and sanctioned its occasional use, generally as a last resort, on both male and female slaves if they did not, in his words, \"do their duty by fair means.\"<ref name=Hirschfeld36 /> There are accounts of carpenters being whipped in 1758 when the overseer \"could see a fault\", of a slave called Jemmy being whipped for stealing corn and escaping in 1773 and of a seamstress called Charlotte being whipped in 1793 by an overseer \"determined to lower Spirit or skin her Back\" for impudence and refusing to work.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 125</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 248, 432 n6 & n7</ref>\n\nWashington regarded the \"passion\" with which one of his overseers administered floggings to be counter-productive, and Charlotte's protest that she had not been whipped in fourteen years indicates the frequency with which physical punishment was used.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 125\u2013126</ref><ref>MVLA Resistance & Punishment</ref> Whippings were administered by overseers after review, a system Washington required to ensure slaves were spared capricious and extreme punishment.

By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry. The transition left Washington with a surplus of slaves and revealed to him the inefficiencies of the slave labor system.<ref name=Morgan2005p413>Morgan 2005 p. 413</ref><ref name=Twohig118>Twohig 2001 p. 118</ref>\n\nThere is little evidence that Washington seriously questioned the ethics of slavery before the Revolution.<ref name=Twohig118 /> In the 1760s he often participated in tavern lotteries, events in which defaulters' debts were settled by raffling off their assets to a high-spirited crowd.<ref>Chernow 2010 p. 162</ref> In 1769, Washington co-managed one such lottery in which fifty-five slaves were sold, among them six families and five females with children. The more valuable married males were raffled together with their wives and children; less valuable slaves were separated from their families into different lots. Robin and Bella, for example, were raffled together as husband and wife while their children, twelve-year-old Sukey and seven-year-old Betty, were listed in a separate lot. Only chance dictated whether the family would remain together, and with 1,840 tickets on sale the odds were not good.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 178\u2013180</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Henry Wiencek]] concludes that the repugnance Washington felt at this cruelty in which he had participated prompted his decision not to break up slave families by sale or purchase, and marks the beginning of a transformation in Washington's thinking about the morality of slavery.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 135, 188</ref> Wiencek writes that in 1775 Washington took more slaves than he needed rather than break up the family of a slave he had agreed to accept in payment of a debt.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 188</ref> The historians [[Philip D.

Morgan writes that in 1772, Washington was \"all business\" and \"might have been buying livestock\" in purchasing more slaves who were to be, in Washington's words, \"strait Limb'd, & in every respect strong & likely, with good Teeth & good Countenance.\" Morgan gives a different account of the 1775 purchase, writing that Washington resold the slave because of the slave's resistance to being separated from family and that the decision to do so was \"no more than the conventional piety of large Virginia planters who usually said they did not want to break up slave families{{snd}}and often did it anyway.\"<ref name=Morgan2005p412>Morgan 2005 p. 412</ref><ref name=Henriques159>Henriques 2008 p. 159</ref>\n\n===American Revolution===\n[[File:List of George Washington's taxable property in Truro Parish Virginia including slaves 1788.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Washington's taxable property in April 1788: 121 slaves, 98 horses, 4 mules and a chariot|alt=Original document]]\nFrom the late 1760s, Washington became increasingly radicalized against the North American colonies' subservient status within the [[British Empire]].<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 69</ref> In 1774 he was a key participant in the adoption of the [[Fairfax Resolves]] which, alongside the assertion of colonial rights, condemned the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]] on moral grounds.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 75</ref><ref name=Twohig118 /> He began to express the growing rift with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in terms of slavery, stating in the summer of 1774 that the British authorities were \"endeavouring by every piece of Art & despotism to fix the Shackles of Slavry{{sic}}\" upon the colonies. Two years later, on taking command of the [[Continental Army]] at Cambridge at the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]], he wrote in orders to his troops that \"it is a noble Cause we are engaged in, it is the Cause of virtue and mankind...freedom or Slavery must be the result of our conduct.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 p.64</ref> The hypocrisy inherent in slave owners characterizing a war of independence as a struggle for their own freedom from slavery was not lost on the British writer [[Samuel Johnson]], who asked, \"How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 191</ref>\n\nWashington shared the common southern concern about arming African-Americans or slaves and initially refused to accept either into the ranks of the Continental Army. He reversed his position on the recruitment of free African-Americans when the royal governor of Virginia, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], issued a [[Dunmore's Proclamation|proclamation]] in November 1775 offering freedom to rebel-owned slaves who enlisted in the British forces.

He sought to liberate himself from an economically unviable system, not to liberate his slaves. They were still a property from which he expected to profit. During a period of severe wartime depreciation, the question was not whether to sell his slaves, but when, where and how best to sell them.

Six of them had been collated into an expensively bound volume titled ''Tracts on Slavery'', indicating that he attached some importance to that selection. Five of the six were published in or after 1788.{{efn|''Tracts on Slavery'' was one volume in a set of thirty-six that Washington had bound probably sometime after 1795. The volumes covered subjects that generally were of importance to him, such as agriculture, the Revolution, the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and politics. The single pre-1788 pamphlet of the six in ''Tracts on Slavery'' was ''A Serious Address to the Rulers of America, on the Inconsistency of Their Conduct Respecting Slavery'', published in 1783. It was the first pamphlet in the volume, and Washington had written his signature on the cover, as he did with the first pamphlet in each of the thirty-six volumes. Of the eleven pamphlets on slavery that were, presumably, not considered to be worth binding, eight were published before 1788. One of them, published in 1785, was never read. The implication is that Washington became more interested in the subject in the early 1790s.<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 251\u2013253, 260, 263\u2013264</ref>}} All six shared common themes that slaves first had to be educated about the obligations of liberty before they could be emancipated, a belief Washington is reported to have expressed himself in 1798, and that abolition should be realized by a gradual legislative process, an idea that began to appear in Washington's correspondence during the [[Confederation Period|Confederation period]].<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 250\u2013253, 273\u2013275, 285</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\">Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\nWashington was not impressed by what Dorothy Twohig{{snd}}a former editor-in-chief of [[The Washington Papers]]{{snd}}described as the \"imperious demands\" and \"evangelical piety\" of Quaker efforts to advance abolition, and in 1786 he complained about their \"tamper[ing] with & seduc[ing]\" slaves who \"are happy & content to remain with their present masters.\"<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 129</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p419>Morgan 2005 p. 419</ref> Only the most radical of abolitionists called for immediate emancipation.

Lafayette had taken concerns about the abrupt emancipation of slaves into account, paying and educating the slaves he settled on the plantation before freeing them. He became a leading figure in the French movement against the slave trade and a corresponding member of the British movement. Washington would not have known of Lafayette's antislavery activities in Cayenne or Europe from Lafayette himself; although the two continued to correspond for the rest of Washington's life, the subject of slavery virtually disappeared from their letters.

He presided over the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, during which it became obvious just how explosive the issue was and how willing the antislavery faction was to accept the preservation of slavery to ensure national unity and the establishment of a strong federal government. The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country. Wiencek suggests Washington considered making precisely such a statement on taking up the presidency in 1789. A passage in the notebook of Washington's biographer [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]]{{efn|Humphreys was a former aide to Washington and had begun an eighteen-month stay at Mount Vernon in 1787 to assist Washington with his correspondence and write his biography.<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 153</ref>}} dated to late 1788 or early 1789 recorded a statement that resembled the emancipation clause in Washington's will a decade later. Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves. It marks, Wiencek believes, a moral epiphany in Washington's thinking, the moment he decided not only to emancipate his slaves but also to use the occasion to set the example Lafayette had urged in 1783.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\">Wiencek 2003 pp. 272\u2013275</ref> Other historians dispute Wiencek's conclusion; Henriques and [[Joseph Ellis]] concur with Philip Morgan's opinion that Washington experienced no epiphanies in a \"long and hard-headed struggle\" in which there was no single turning point. Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests.

Washington understood there was little widespread organized support for abolition.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 125\u2013126</ref> He had a keen sense both of the fragility of the fledgling Republic and of his place as a unifying figure, and he was determined not to endanger either by confronting an issue as divisive and entrenched as slavery.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 126\u2013128</ref><ref>Morgan 2000 pp. 290, 295</ref> He was president of a government that passed a resolution in 1790 affirming states' rights to regulate treatment of slaves and legislate on slavery free of congressional interference, provided materiel and financial support for French efforts to suppress the [[Haitian Revolution|Saint Domingue slave revolt]] in 1791 and implemented the proslavery [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]].<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 275\u2013276</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 p. 130</ref><ref name=Morgan2000-297>Morgan 2000 p. 297</ref> He also signed into law the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]] that sought to limit American involvement in the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]].<ref>Stathis 2014 pp. 17\u201318</ref> Washington never spoke publicly on the issue of slavery during his eight years as president, nor did he respond to, much less act upon, any of the antislavery petitions he received. He described a 1790 Quaker petition to [[United States Congress|Congress]] urging an immediate end to the slave trade as \"an illjudged piece of business\" that \"occasioned a great waste of time.\" The issue of slavery was not mentioned in either his last address to Congress or his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 126</ref><ref>Boller 1961 pp. 85, 87</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 p. 363</ref>\n\nLate in his presidency, Washington told his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Edmund Randolph]], that in the event of a confrontation between North and South, he had \"made up his mind to remove and be of the Northern.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 362</ref> In 1798, he imagined just such a conflict when he said, \"I can clearly foresee that nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 361\u2013362</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\"/> But there is no indication Washington ever favored an immediate end to slavery.

This plan would have involved breaking up slave families, but it was designed with an end goal of raising enough finances to fund their eventual emancipation (a detail Washington kept secret) and prevent the Custis heirs from permanently splitting up families by sale.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 339\u2013342</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 303\u2013304</ref>{{efn|The dower slaves had already begun to be transferred to Martha's granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.

The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families.

It is possible Washington hoped Martha and her heirs who would inherit the dower slaves would solve this problem by following his example and emancipating them.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 354</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 216</ref><ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\"/> Those too old or infirm to work were to be supported by his estate, as mandated by state law. Washington went beyond the legal requirement to support and maintain younger slaves until adulthood, stipulating that those children whose education could not be undertaken by parents were to be taught reading, writing and a useful trade by their masters and then be freed at the age of twenty-five.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 294</ref> Washington was particularly pointed in forbidding the sale or transportation of any of his slaves out of Virginia before their emancipation.<ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> Including the Dandridge slaves, who were emancipated under similar terms, more than 160 slaves were freed.<ref name=\"Morgan2005pp404\u2013405\" /><ref name=gwpapers /> Although he was not alone among Virginian slaveowners in freeing their slaves, he was the only Founding Father to do so.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 427</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Slave Memorial - Mt. Vernon.jpg|thumb|right|Slave burial ground memorial at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph]]\nAny hopes Washington may have had that his example and prestige would influence the thinking of others, including his own family, proved to be unfounded. His action was ignored by southern slaveholders, and slavery continued at Mount Vernon.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 359</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 216\u2013217</ref> Already from 1795, dower slaves were being transferred to Martha's three granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 341</ref> Martha felt threatened by the fact that she was surrounded with slaves whose freedom depended on her death and freed her late husband's slaves on January 1, 1801.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 311</ref>{{efn|There is a suggestion that slaves were implicated in starting a fire at the main residence after Washington's death, and there were rumors that Martha was in danger, including one that slaves planned to poison her. Other factors that may have influenced her decision to free Washington's slaves early include concerns about the expense of maintaining slaves that were not necessary to operate the estate and about discontent among the dower slaves if they continued to mix with slaves who were to be freed.<ref>Schwartz 2017 pp. 29\u201333</ref>}}\n\nAble-bodied slaves were freed and left to support themselves and their families.<ref>Schwartz 2017 pp. 34\u201335</ref> Within a few months, almost all of Washington's former slaves had left Mount Vernon, leaving 121 adult and working-age children still working the estate. Five freedwomen were listed as remaining: an unmarried mother of two children; two women, one of them with three children, married to Washington slaves too old to work; and two women who were married to dower slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 311\u2013312</ref> William Lee remained at Mount Vernon, where he worked as a shoemaker.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 27</ref> After Martha's death on May 22, 1802, most of the remaining dower slaves passed to her grandson, [[George Washington Parke Custis]], to whom she bequeathed the only slave she held in her own name.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 341, 358</ref>\n\nThere are few records of how the newly freed slaves fared.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 35</ref> Custis later wrote that \"although many of them, with a view to their liberation, had been instructed in mechanic trades, yet they succeeded very badly as freemen; so true is the axiom, 'that the hour which makes man a slave, takes half his worth away'.\" The son-in-law of Custis's sister wrote in 1853 that the descendants of those who remained slaves, many of them now in his possession, had been \"prosperous, contented and happy,\" while those who had been freed had led a life of \"vice, dissipation and idleness\" and had, in their \"sickness, age and poverty\", become a burden to his in-laws.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 316</ref> Such reports were influenced by the innate racism of the well-educated, upper-class authors and ignored the social and legal impediments that prejudiced the chances of prosperity for former slaves, which included laws that made it illegal to teach freedpeople to read and write and, in 1806, required newly freed slaves to leave the state.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317, 449 n83</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 215</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that some of Washington's former slaves were able to buy land, support their families and prosper as free people. By 1812, Free Town in [[Truro Parish, Virginia|Truro Parish]], the earliest known free African-American settlement in Fairfax County, contained seven households of former Washington slaves. By the mid 1800s, a son of Washington's carpenter Davy Jones and two grandsons of his [[postilion]] Joe Richardson had each bought land in Virginia. Francis Lee, younger brother of William, was well known and respected enough to have his obituary printed in the ''Alexandria Gazette'' on his death at Mount Vernon in 1821. Sambo Anderson{{snd}}who hunted game, as he had while Washington's slave, and prospered for a while by selling it to the most respectable families in Alexandria{{snd}}was similarly noted by the ''Gazette'' when he died near Mount Vernon in 1845.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317\u2013319</ref> Research published in 2019 has concluded that Hercules worked as a cook in New York, where he died on May 15, 1812.<ref>Ganeshram 2019</ref>\n\nA decade after Washington's death, the Pennsylvanian jurist [[Richard Peters (Continental Congress)|Richard Peters]] wrote that Washington's servants \"were devoted to him; and especially those more immediately about his person. The survivors of them still venerate and adore his memory.\" In his old age, Anderson said he was \"a much happier man when he was a slave than he had ever been since,\" because he then \"had a good kind master to look after all my wants, but now I have no one to care for me.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 322\u2013323</ref> When Judge was interviewed in the 1840s, she expressed considerable bitterness, not at the way she he had been treated as a slave, but at the fact that she had been enslaved. When asked, having experienced the hardships of being a freewoman and having outlived both husband and children, whether she regretted her escape, she replied, \"No, I am free, and have, I trust, been made a child of God by [that] means.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 288\u2013289</ref>\n\n===Political legacy===\nWashington's will was both private testament and public statement on the institution.<ref name=Morgan2005p404>Morgan 2005 p. 404</ref><ref name=Morgan2000p298>Morgan 2000 p. 298</ref> It was published widely{{snd}}in newspapers nationwide, as a pamphlet which, in 1800 alone, extended to thirteen separate editions, and included in other works{{snd}}and became part of the nationalist narrative.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201385</ref> In the eulogies of the antislavery faction, the inconvenient fact of Washington's slaveholding was downplayed in favor of his final act of emancipation. Washington \"disdained to hold his fellow-creatures in abject domestic servitude,\" wrote the Massachusetts Federalist [[Timothy Bigelow (lawyer)|Timothy Bigelow]] before calling on \"fellow-citizens in the South\" to emulate Washington's example. In this narrative, Washington was a proto-abolitionist who, having added the freedom of his slaves to the freedom from British slavery he had won for the nation, would be mobilized to serve the antislavery cause.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nAn alternative narrative more in line with proslavery sentiments embraced rather than excised Washington's ownership of slaves. Washington was cast as a paternal figure, the benevolent father not only of his country but also of a family of slaves bound to him by affection rather than coercion.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 92\u201394</ref> In this narrative, slaves idolized Washington and wept at his deathbed, and in an 1807 biography, [[Aaron Bancroft]] wrote, \"In domestick{{sic}} and private life, he blended the authority of the master with the care and kindness of the guardian and friend.\"<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 94, 96\u201397</ref> The competing narratives allowed both [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and [[Confederate States of America|South]] to claim Washington as the father of their countries during the [[American Civil War]] that ended slavery more than half a century after his death.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\n===Memorial===\nIn 1929, a plaque was embedded in the ground at Mount Vernon less than {{convert|50|yd|m|round=5}} from the crypt housing the remains of Washington and Martha, marking a plot neglected by both groundsmen and tourist guides where slaves had been buried in unmarked graves. The inscription read, \"In memory of the many faithful colored servants of the Washington family, buried at Mount Vernon from 1760 to 1860. Their unidentified graves surround this spot.\" The site remained untended and ignored in the visitor literature until the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association erected a more prominent monument surrounded with plantings and inscribed, \"In memory of the Afro Americans who served as slaves at Mount Vernon this monument marking their burial ground dedicated September 21, 1983.\" In 1985, a [[ground-penetrating radar]] survey identified sixty-six possible burials. As of late 2017, an archaeological project begun in 2014 has identified, without disturbing the contents, sixty-three burial plots in addition to seven plots known before the project began.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 217\u2013218</ref><ref>MVLA Slave Burial Ground Archaeology</ref><ref>MVLA Forgotten No Longer</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Chernow |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Chernow |title=Washington, A Life |title-link=Washington: A Life |type=e-book |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London, United Kingdom |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-141-96610-6 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Joseph J. |authorlink=Joseph Ellis |title=His Excellency: George Washington |publisher=Alfred A.

After getting exceptional hospitality in the ashram, he came to know about the divine cow Nandini. When a famine struck his kingdom he asks his counsel to get Nandini cow from [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]], which the later refuses.\n|-\n|3\n|Angry King Vishwarath reaches the ashram and tries to get the cow forcefully but failed. The humiliated king decides to gain divine power by doing [[Tapas (Indian religions)|tapasya]] and abdicates the throne for his son.\n|-\n|4\n|Vishwarath got the boon of various divine weapons from [[Brahma|Lord Brahma]]. He again reaches [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s [[ashram]] to capture Nandini but fails. He vows to gain more power by doing great penance to become a [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishi]].\n|-\n|5\n|Ayodhya King Sathyavrata anoints his son Harishchandra as the new King and decides to ascend heaven with his mortal body. However, his unnatural wishes got refuted by [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]. He tried to lure [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s son Satya to help him achieve his desires. An angry Satya curses Sathyavrata and makes him [[Trishanku]].\n|-\n|6\n|Vishwarath after severe penance and tapasya gained more powers and blessing of Mother Gayatri, Vishwarath the warrior became Vishwamitra the sage.\n|-\n|7\n|A dejected [[Trishanku]] approaches Vishwamitra to achieve his desires. After knowing that [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] refused his wishes, Vishwamitra promises him the impossible. But his [[yajna]] got rejected by Indra and other gods.\n|-\n|8\n|Vishwamitra begins creating alternate heaven for Trishanku when gods dismiss him from Indra's heaven.\n|-\n|9\n|[[B\u1e5bhaspati]] (along with [[Narada]] ) tries to persuade Vishwamitra to abandon creation new heaven for Trishanku which he agrees. However, Narada later instigates him reminding the promise he made to Trishanku. Vishwamitra begins more penance to gain uninterrupted access to heaven. Knowing this Indra and other gods (on the advice of Brhaspati) decide to disrupt his [[tapasya]]. They create a celestial Mahashakti after uniting their powers. But he failed and Vishwamitra killed him with his divine powers.\n|-\n|10\n|[[Indra]] decides to disrupt Vishwamitra's penance by sending [[apsara]] Rambha to seduce him. But an angry Vishwamitra curses her and turned her into a rock. She regretted her actions and asked for forgiveness. He gave her the boon that in future she will be liberated by a Maharishi. After failing repeatedly, Indra decides to disrupt his tapasya himself and went to Vishwamitra disguising as a hungry brahmin. But Vishwamitra recognized him easily and still gave his divine food gained from penance. He embarrasses Indra for his malevolent deeds. A dejected and humiliated Indra leaves for heaven.\n|-\n|11\n|Upon advice of Brhaspati, Indra summons apsara [[Menaka|Meneka]] to seduce Vishwamitra. A reluctant Menaka agrees for the task. She decides to take help from [[Rati]] and [[Kamadeva|Kamadev]].\n|-\n|12\n|After severe attempts Menaka successfully gained the attention of Vishwamitra and made him fell in love with her. \n|-\n|13\n|Both of them got married and thus Indra task finally got fulfilled. He then asks Menaka to return back to heaven but Menaka refuses as she's in love with Vishwamitra too. Indra orders her to return as it'll be unnatural for a celestial being to spend time on earth. A year later Menaka gave birth to a daughter. Narada reminds Indra that Menaka hasn't returned to heaven. \n|-\n|14\n|Menaka finally confesses to Vishwamitra that she was sent on a mission by Indra and now as her task is complete she had to return. An angry and disheartened Vishwamitra abandons Menaka and his daughter and sets out to fulfill his vow to become a Maharishi. Menaka also ascended to heaven leaving their daughter behind. [[Rishi]] [[Kanva]] and his wife Gautami found the girl in the forest and adopted her. As a baby, she was surrounded by Shakunta birds ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924, \u015bakunta). Therefore, he named her Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0932\u093e), meaning Shakunta-protected.\n|-\n|15\n|King [[Dushyanta]] arrives in Rishi Kanva's ashram and fell in love with Shakuntala.\n|-\n|16\n|Shakuntala and Dushyant's love blossoms.\n|-\n|17\n|Dushyant proposes Shakuntala for marriage and they have a [[gandharva]] marriage. Having to leave after some time, Dushyant gives Shakuntala a royal ring as a sign of their love, promising her that he will come to her. One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.\n|-\n|18\n|Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance. Her friends decide not to tell her anything about the curse. Shakuntala got pregnant and Rishi Kanva decides to send her to Dushyanta. \n|-\n|19\n|So, Shakuntala sets off to the capital, [[Hastinapur]], to remind Dushyant of their past love. Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.\n|-\n|20\n|Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity. \n|-\n|21\n|To assess Harishchandra's commitment towards truthfulness, Vishwamitra reaches his court and asks for an unusually huge amount of treasure for yajna purpose which the King readily accepts. Even upon insistence from the King and his counsel, Vishwamitra refuses to take the treasure at once and asks the king to set aside the treasure with himself and he will take it when the right time arrives.

However, his unnatural wishes got refuted by [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]. He tried to lure [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s son Satya to help him achieve his desires.

However, Narada later instigates him reminding the promise he made to Trishanku. Vishwamitra begins more penance to gain uninterrupted access to heaven. Knowing this Indra and other gods (on the advice of Brhaspati) decide to disrupt his [[tapasya]]. They create a celestial Mahashakti after uniting their powers. But he failed and Vishwamitra killed him with his divine powers.\n|-\n|10\n|[[Indra]] decides to disrupt Vishwamitra's penance by sending [[apsara]] Rambha to seduce him. But an angry Vishwamitra curses her and turned her into a rock. She regretted her actions and asked for forgiveness. He gave her the boon that in future she will be liberated by a Maharishi. After failing repeatedly, Indra decides to disrupt his tapasya himself and went to Vishwamitra disguising as a hungry brahmin. But Vishwamitra recognized him easily and still gave his divine food gained from penance. He embarrasses Indra for his malevolent deeds.

[[Rishi]] [[Kanva]] and his wife Gautami found the girl in the forest and adopted her. As a baby, she was surrounded by Shakunta birds ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924, \u015bakunta). Therefore, he named her Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0932\u093e), meaning Shakunta-protected.\n|-\n|15\n|King [[Dushyanta]] arrives in Rishi Kanva's ashram and fell in love with Shakuntala.\n|-\n|16\n|Shakuntala and Dushyant's love blossoms.\n|-\n|17\n|Dushyant proposes Shakuntala for marriage and they have a [[gandharva]] marriage. Having to leave after some time, Dushyant gives Shakuntala a royal ring as a sign of their love, promising her that he will come to her. One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.\n|-\n|18\n|Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance. Her friends decide not to tell her anything about the curse. Shakuntala got pregnant and Rishi Kanva decides to send her to Dushyanta. \n|-\n|19\n|So, Shakuntala sets off to the capital, [[Hastinapur]], to remind Dushyant of their past love. Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.\n|-\n|20\n|Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity. \n|-\n|21\n|To assess Harishchandra's commitment towards truthfulness, Vishwamitra reaches his court and asks for an unusually huge amount of treasure for yajna purpose which the King readily accepts. Even upon insistence from the King and his counsel, Vishwamitra refuses to take the treasure at once and asks the king to set aside the treasure with himself and he will take it when the right time arrives. Later, Viswamitra creates and send wild animals to Harishchandra's kingdom to further test his mettle.\n|-\n|22\n|\n|}\n\n== Music ==\nLyrics for various songs were written by Bhring Tupkari and music was composed by Vasu Rao.
