He was indicted in [[Argentina]] for his alleged role in the 1992 [[Israeli embassy attack in Buenos Aires]]. The highest-profile attacks for which it is claimed he is responsible took place in the early 1980s, shortly after the founding of Hezbollah, when Mughniyeh was in his early twenties. U.S. intelligence officials have accused him of killing more [[United States]] citizens than any other man prior to the [[September 11 attacks]], and the bombings and kidnappings he is alleged to have organized are credited with all but eliminating and completely removing the [[US military]] presence in Lebanon in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=Lebanon&article=662|title=The Arab American News  \u2013 Mughnieh murder could trigger retaliation|work=arabamericannews.com}}</ref>\n\nMughniyeh was known by his ''nom de guerre'' Al-Hajj Radwan.

He participated in the defence of West Beirut, where he was wounded in the fighting. After the withdrawal of PLO forces from Beirut in September 1982, Mughniyeh acquired an important position in the nascent resistance to the Israeli occupation, due to his knowledge of arms caches left behind by the Palestinians.

He participated in the defence of West Beirut, where he was wounded in the fighting. After the withdrawal of PLO forces from Beirut in September 1982, Mughniyeh acquired an important position in the nascent resistance to the Israeli occupation, due to his knowledge of arms caches left behind by the Palestinians. He remained a Fatah member during this period but also worked with other factions, such as the leftist Lebanese National Movement and Islamic resistance groups. Mughniyeh remained a member of Fatah until 1984, when he joined the newly created Islamic Resistance of [[Hezbollah]]. However, he remained close to Fatah leader [[Khalil al-Wazir]] (Abu Jihad) until the latter's death in 1988.

The [[Oaks (greyhounds)|Oaks]] (for bitches only) would complete a trio of classic races. The GRA purchased the Hook estate at [[Northaw]] some 13 miles from the centre of London. They saw it as the ideal place for GRA trainers to train greyhounds for White City and [[Harringay Stadium]] which was their third track to open, and later other London tracks. The 140 acres of park and grassland became famous within the industry.<ref name=RG75>{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Greyhound and Racing Greyhound|year=1975|publisher=Page Brothers (Norwich)|isbn=0-85020-0474}}</ref>\n\nThe Derby competition became the primary target for all greyhound connections.

It was an invitation race for the sports top greyhounds but only lasted until the start of the [[World War II|war]].

Quare Times broke the track record twice during the 1946 event which led to Major Brown organising a match race between the pair at White City on August Bank Holiday Monday. Quare Times won the race setting a new world record for the 550 yards. Also in 1946 another new event was introduced called the Longcross Cup.<ref name=RG81/>\n\nIn 1949, three new sea-food bars attract more than 4,000 customers on race nights and the track employs 14 part time staff to cope with the demand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/22658-2/|title=Remember When - October 1949|publisher=Greyhound Star}}</ref>\n\n===1950s===\nWhite City was featured in numerous films including the 1950 movie [[The Blue Lamp]] and one year later Major Percy Brown had to select 48 greyhounds for the Derby from a record 140 entries.<ref name=RG81/>\n\nIn December 1955 Spanish Battleship travelled to England for the first time for a special match race with Duet leader and Hi There at White City.

Arthur Aldridge former RM of [[Powderhall Stadium]] and Belle Vue was brought in as the new White City RM.

The official line was that a new modern White City stadium would be built in the remaining four acres from the existing sixteen. A greyhound reporter called Neil Martin stated ''this move must spell death to all sport there in time \u2013 and in my opinion greyhound racing too'' Fellow reporter John Bower had a different view that it would create a wonderful new stadium, a view seemingly given substance by GRA\nannouncing that the architects plans were already drawn up.

Also in 1982 trainer Joe Pickering (who joined the track in 1956) retired as did Colin West leaving White City two trainers short. They appointed Graham Mann and Frank Melville. Randy Singleton retired soon after.<ref name=RG90/>\n\n===Closure===\nThe 1969 option to sell to Stock Conversion and Investment Ltd for redevelopment had almost been forgotten due to the fact that racing had continued for another 15 years but in 1984 the redevelopment plans went ahead without plans to build a new stadium. The final Derby took place in late June before the final meeting on 22 September 1984. Hastings Girl trained by Tommy Foster was the last winner and before the month had passed demolition teams had demolished the historic stadium.\n\nThe GRA, the company who introduced greyhound racing

The venue was regarded as the sport's primary track during its existence.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nAfter the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] the White City area was used for further exhibitions but the stadium began to be underused. By 1922 attempts had been made to sell it and it is reputed to have been in a very poor state by 1926. During the Februarys of 1926 and 1927 the stadium was used for the British Industries Fair before the public announcement that the [[Greyhound Racing Association]] (GRA) had purchased the stadium following on from the success experienced by the company at the nation's first greyhound meetings in [[Manchester]] at [[Belle Vue Stadium]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ash|first=Edward C|title=The Book of the Greyhound|page =303|year=1933|publisher=Hutchinson & Co}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=oxfshlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS203758740&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|title=\"Greyhound Racing.\" Times [London, England] 20 Apr. 1927|publisher=The Times Digital Archive.}}</ref>\n\nIt would be the GRA\u2019s second stadium and the old running and cycle tracks were grassed over. A new restaurant was built and covered terracing was constructed. The Metropolitan Railway reopened their [[Wood Lane tube station|Wood Lane station]] in preparation for the race nights.<ref name=HT>{{cite book|last=Tarter|first=P Howard|title=Greyhound Racing Encyclopedia|year=1949|publisher=Fleet Publishing Company Ltd}}</ref>\n\n===Opening===\nThe first greyhounds moved into the kennels on 20 May and the first private trial was planned for 30 May with racing starting on 1 June but delays ensued.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=oxfshlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS270212268&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|title=\"Greyhound Racing.\" Times [London, England] 12 May 1927|publisher=The Times Digital Archive.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=oxfshlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS101391541&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|title=\"Greyhound Racing.\" Times [London, England] 21 May 1927|publisher=The Times Digital Archive.}}</ref> The first meeting finally took place on Monday 20 June 1927 with the first race won by a greyhound called Charlie Cranston. Entry Badge, the [[1927 English Greyhound Derby]] winner, also ran on the opening night.

The hare system was an outside trolley type and the GRA\u2019s finances were helped with the use of an automatic [[Tote board|totalisator]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=oxfshlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS117906641&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|title=\"Greyhound Racing.\" Times [London, England] 17 June 1927|publisher=The Times Digital Archive.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://find.galegroup.com/ttda/infomark.do?&source=gale&prodId=TTDA&userGroupName=oxfshlib&tabID=T003&docPage=article&searchType=BasicSearchForm&docId=CS303242453&type=multipage&contentSet=LTO&version=1.0|title=\"Greyhound Racing.\" Times [London, England] 21 June 1927|publisher=The Times Digital Archive.}}</ref>\n\n===1928-1939===\nThe GRA moved its headquarters to White City from Belle Vue and early visitors included the Prince of Wales later King [[Edward VIII]] and Prince George, later King [[George VI]].<ref name=RG81>{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Encyclopedia of Greyhound Racing|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=07207-1106-1}}</ref>\n\nThe [[English Greyhound Derby]] was inaugurated in 1927 followed by the Champion Hurdle (renamed the [[Grand National (greyhounds)|Grand National]]) the following year. The [[Oaks (greyhounds)|Oaks]] (for bitches only) would complete a trio of classic races. The GRA purchased the Hook estate at [[Northaw]] some 13 miles from the centre of London. They saw it as the ideal place for GRA trainers to train greyhounds for White City and [[Harringay Stadium]] which was their third track to open, and later other London tracks. The 140 acres of park and grassland became famous within the industry.<ref name=RG75>{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=The Greyhound and Racing Greyhound|year=1975|publisher=Page Brothers (Norwich)|isbn=0-85020-0474}}</ref>\n\nThe Derby competition became the primary target for all greyhound connections. The first winner was Entry Badge who picked up 1,000, he was trained by local trainer Joe Harmon and had won a race on opening night. The following year all qualifying rounds would be held at White City which had not been the case in 1927.<ref name=DACK>{{cite book|last=Dack|first=Barrie|title=Greyhound Derby, the first 60 years|year=1990|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-36-8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1929 [[Mick the Miller]] arrived for his first Derby from Ireland and captured the public\u2019s imagination sending greyhound racing into most households in Britain and Ireland. His successful defence of the title one year later drew a 50,000 crowd and the controversial final of 1931 attracted 70,000.<ref name=DACK/> Major Percy Brown was installed as Racing Manager (RM) in 1931 arriving from sister track Belle Vue and greyhounds that won the Derby over the following years found fame.\n\nIn 1936 the stadium introduced the Wood Lane Stakes and the 'White City', the former would remain an important race throughout the years but the latter was less known despite rewards that came second only to the Derby in terms of prize money. It was an invitation race for the sports top greyhounds but only lasted until the start of the [[World War II|war]]. In 1937 the [[Springbok]] and GRA Stakes was inaugurated for novice hurdlers and stayers respectively. Early track trainers included [[Leslie Reynolds]], William Dixon, Albert Jonas, Les Parry and Harry Buck.<ref name=RG75/> A greyhound called Brave Don was the first to be transported to Britain from Ireland by air. He came into the kennels of Leslie Reynolds following a flight from Dublin to Croydon.<ref>{{cite news|title=Remember When - July 1937|year=2012|newspaper=Greyhound Star}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938 the track boasted that they had the largest [[tote board|totalisator]] in the world with 634 issuing machines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tinyurl.galegroup.com/tinyurl/6xTCAX|title=\"Greyhound Racing Association Trust.\" Times, 1 Feb. 1938|publisher=The Times Digital Archive}}</ref>\n\nA record 92,000 people attended the [[1939 English Greyhound Derby]] and the tote turnover set new records of \u00a314,341 for a single race and \u00a3114,780 for a meeting.

Quare Times broke the track record twice during the 1946 event which led to Major Brown organising a match race between the pair at White City on August Bank Holiday Monday. Quare Times won the race setting a new world record for the 550 yards. Also in 1946 another new event was introduced called the Longcross Cup.<ref name=RG81/>\n\nIn 1949, three new sea-food bars attract more than 4,000 customers on race nights and the track employs 14 part time staff to cope with the demand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/22658-2/|title=Remember When - October 1949|publisher=Greyhound Star}}</ref>\n\n===1950s===\nWhite City was featured in numerous films including the 1950 movie [[The Blue Lamp]] and one year later Major Percy Brown had to select 48 greyhounds for the Derby from a record 140 entries.<ref name=RG81/>\n\nIn December 1955 Spanish Battleship travelled to England for the first time for a special match race with Duet leader and Hi There at White City. [[Pigalle Wonder]] and [[Mile Bush Pride]] won the Derby during the 1950s and the Gimcrack (later called The Challenge) race was introduced in 1959 with the Oaks moving to sister track Harringay.<ref name=RG75/>\n\n===1960s===\nIn 1964 trainer Randolph Singleton was transferred to White City from Belle Vue and the GRA extended its board by adding Major Percy Brown, John Cearns (son of [[Will Cearns|W.J Cearns]]) and Charles Chandler Jr. to the directors. Arthur Aldridge former RM of [[Powderhall Stadium]] and Belle Vue was brought in as the new White City RM. Camira Flash owned by the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] won the Derby for White City for only the third time.<ref name=RG90>{{cite book|last=Genders|first=Roy|title=NGRC book of Greyhound Racing|year=1990|publisher=Pelham Books Ltd|isbn=0-7207-1804-X}}</ref>\n\nA story broke in 1969 that the GRA had granted an option to Stock Conversion and Investment Ltd to purchase greyhound racing\u2019s premier track White City for redevelopment. The official line was that a new modern White City stadium would be built in the remaining four acres from the existing sixteen. A greyhound reporter called Neil Martin stated ''this move must spell death to all sport there in time \u2013 and in my opinion greyhound racing too'' Fellow reporter John Bower had a different view that it would create a wonderful new stadium, a view seemingly given substance by GRA\nannouncing that the architects plans were already drawn up. The future of the stadium was unknown.<ref name=RG90/><ref>{{cite news|title=White City Stock Conversion|year=1969|newspaper=Greyhound Magazine}}</ref>\n\n===1970s===\n[[Patricias Hope]] won his second Derby and [[Sherrys Prince]] won his third consecutive Grand National victory in 1972, an added bonus for White City was the fact that his trainer Colin West had recently joined the track. West and the Cambridgeshire competition had transferred from the recently closed [[West Ham Stadium]].<ref name=DACK/><ref name=RG90/> In 1972 GRA Director of racing Major Percy Brown retired after 40 years in the sport, his replacement was the Arthur Aldridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greyhoundstar.co.uk/remember-when-june-4/|title=Greyhound Star (Remember When - June)|publisher=Greyhound Star}}</ref> In 1975 the track switched to metres under the supervision of RM Bob Rowe.\n\n===1981-1984===\nDuring 1982 Bob Rowe relinquished his position to take up the role of chief racing manager of the GRA with John Collins brought in as the new RM. Also in 1982 trainer Joe Pickering (who joined the track in 1956) retired as did Colin West leaving White City two trainers short. They appointed Graham Mann and Frank Melville. Randy Singleton retired soon after.<ref name=RG90/>\n\n===Closure===\nThe 1969 option to sell to Stock Conversion and Investment Ltd for redevelopment had almost been forgotten due to the fact that racing had continued for another 15 years but in 1984 the redevelopment plans went ahead without plans to build a new stadium. The final Derby took place in late June before the final meeting on 22 September 1984. Hastings Girl trained by Tommy Foster was the last winner and before the month had passed demolition teams had demolished the historic stadium.\n\nThe GRA, the company who introduced greyhound racing to Britain had sold the sports premier track which became a collection of [[BBC]] buildings.\n\n==Competitions==\n===English Greyhound Derby===\n{{main article|English Greyhound Derby}}\nThe stadium had four home trained Derby winners, Entry Badge [[1927 English Greyhound Derby|(1927)]], Wild Woolley [[1932 English Greyhound Derby|(1932)]], Greta Ranee [[1935 English Greyhound Derby|(1935)]] and

He tells us that a colony from Megara, under the command of a leader named [[Lamis]] ({{lang-grc|\u039b\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2}}), arrived in Sicily about the time that [[Leontini]] was founded by the [[Chalcis|Chalcidic]] colonists, and settled themselves first near the mouth of the river Pantagias, at a place called Trotilon ([[Latin]]: Trotilus, modern [[Brucoli]]). From there they removed to Leontini itself, where they dwelt for a time together with the Chalcidians; but were soon afterwards expelled by them, and next established themselves on the promontory or peninsula of [[Thapsos]] (Latin: Thapsus, modern Magnisi), near Syracuse. They again relocated after the death of Lamis, and, at the suggestion of [[Hyblon]], a Sicilian chief of the surrounding country, finally settled at a place afterwards called the Hyblaean Megara. (Thuc. vi. 4.) [[Scymnus|Scymnus Chius]] follows a different tradition, as he describes the establishment of the Chalcidians at [[Naxos (Sicily)|Naxos]] and that of the Megarians at Hybla as contemporary, and both preceding the foundation of Syracuse, 734&nbsp;BC. [[Strabo]] also adopts the same view, representing Megara as founded about the same time with Naxos (735&nbsp;BC), and before Syracuse. (Scymn. Ch. 271-76; Strab. vi. p.&nbsp;269.) It is impossible to reconcile the two accounts, but that of Thucydides is probably the most trustworthy. Thus the foundation of Megara may be placed about 726&nbsp;BC. Professor Miller, in her reinvestigation of ancient source materials has determined that they point to various dates of foundation from 758&nbsp;BC (per the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronikon]]'' of [[Eusebius]]) to 728&nbsp;BC (from her reconstructions of dates from Thucydides).<ref>M. Miller, ''The Sicilian Colony Dates'' (1970) {{ISBN|0-87395-049-6}}, pp. 18\u201320, 276\u201378</ref> Of its earlier history we have scarcely any information, but it would appear to have attained a flourishing condition, as 100&nbsp;years after its foundation it sent out, in its turn, a colony to the other end of Sicily, where it founded the city of [[Selinus]], which was destined to rise to far greater power than its parent city. (Thuc. vi. 4; Scymn. Ch. 291; Strab. vi. p.&nbsp;272.)\n\nNothing more is known of Megara till the period of its destruction by [[Gelon of Syracuse]], about 483&nbsp;BC, who, after a long siege, made himself master of the city by a capitulation; but, notwithstanding this, caused the bulk of the inhabitants to be sold into slavery, while he established the more wealthy and noble citizens at Syracuse. (Herod. vii. 156; Thuc. vi. 4.) Among the persons thus removed was the celebrated comic poet [[Epicharmus]], who had received his education at Megara, though not a native of that city. ([[Suda]], under {{lang|grc|\u1f18\u03c0\u03af\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}}; [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] viii. 3.) According to Thucydides, this event took place 245&nbsp;years after the foundation of Megara, and may therefore be placed about 483&nbsp;BC. It is certain that Megara never recovered its power and independence. Thucydides distinctly alludes to it as not existing in his time as a city, but repeatedly mentions the locality, o i like chhese UGOERIFPOMGJKNDLMSSALDFJNSBH\n\n\n\n\nn the sea-coast, which was at that time occupied by the Syracusans, but which the [[ancient Athens|Athenian]] general [[Lamachus]], during the [[Sicilian Expedition|expedition against Syracuse]] (415\u2013413&nbsp;BC), proposed to make the headquarters of their fleet; his advice was not taken, and the next spring the Syracusans fortified it. (Thuc. vi. 49, 96.)\n\nFrom this time we meet with repeated mention of a place named Megara or Megaris ([[Scylax|Scyl.]] p.&nbsp;4. \u00a7 6), which it seems impossible to separate from Hybla, and it is probable that the two were, in fact, identical. The site of this later Megara or Hybla may be fixed, with little doubt, at the mouth of the river Alabus (modern [[Cantera river|Cantera]]); but there seems much reason to suppose that the ancient city, the original Greek colony, was situated close to the remarkable promontory now occupied by the city of [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]].<ref>The modern city of this name dates only from the thirteenth century, being founded in 1229 by the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] from whom it derives its name.</ref> It is difficult to believe that this position, the port of which is at least equal to that of Syracuse, while the peninsula itself has the same advantages as that of [[Ortygia]], should have been wholly neglected in ancient times; and such a station would have admirably served the purposes for which Lamachus urged upon his brother generals the occupation of the vacant site of Megara (Thuc. vi. 49.).\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:Pile capital from Megara Hyblea Die Baukunst Der Griechen fig 310.jpg|thumb|[[Pilaster]] [[capital (architecture)|capital]] from Megara Hyblaea with [[palmette]]s between [[volute]]s. 5th century BCE.]]\nExcavations carried on in 1891 led to the discovery of the northern portion of the western town wall, which in one section served at the same time as an embankment against floods\u2014it was apparently more conspicuous in the time of [[Philipp Cluver]], (''Sicilia antiqua'', Leiden, 1619) p.&nbsp;133\u2014of an extensive [[necropolis]], about 1500 tombs of which have been explored, and of a deposit of [[Votive offering|votive]] objects from a temple.

Thucydides distinctly alludes to it as not existing in his time as a city, but repeatedly mentions the locality, on the sea-coast, which was at that time occupied by the Syracusans, but which the [[ancient Athens|Athenian]] general [[Lamachus]], during the [[Sicilian Expedition|expedition against Syracuse]] (415\u2013413&nbsp;BC), proposed to make the headquarters of their fleet; his advice was not taken, and the next spring the Syracusans fortified it. (Thuc. vi. 49, 96.)\n\nFrom this time we meet with repeated mention of a place named Megara or Megaris ([[Scylax|Scyl.]] p.&nbsp;4. \u00a7 6), which it seems impossible to separate from Hybla, and it is probable that the two were, in fact, identical. The site of this later Megara or Hybla may be fixed, with little doubt, at the mouth of the river Alabus (modern [[Cantera river|Cantera]]); but there seems much reason to suppose that the ancient city, the original Greek colony, was situated close to the remarkable promontory now occupied by the city of [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]].<ref>The modern city of this name dates only from the thirteenth century, being founded in 1229 by the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] from whom it derives its name.</ref> It is difficult to believe that this position, the port of which is at least equal to that of Syracuse, while the peninsula itself has the same advantages as that of [[Ortygia]], should have been wholly neglected in ancient times; and such a station would have admirably served the purposes for which Lamachus urged upon his brother generals the occupation of the vacant site of Megara (Thuc. vi. 49.).\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:Pile capital from Megara Hyblea Die Baukunst Der Griechen fig 310.jpg|thumb|[[Pilaster]] [[capital (architecture)|capital]] from Megara Hyblaea with [[palmette]]s between [[volute]]s. 5th century BCE.]]\nExcavations carried on in 1891 led to the discovery of the northern portion of the western town wall, which in one section served at the same time as an embankment against floods\u2014it was apparently more conspicuous in the time of [[Philipp Cluver]], (''Sicilia antiqua'', Leiden, 1619) p.&nbsp;133\u2014of an extensive [[necropolis]], about 1500 tombs of which have been explored, and of a deposit of [[Votive offering|votive]] objects from a temple.
