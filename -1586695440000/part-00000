From this perspective, in every social system there is a dominant (hegemonic) and idealised form of masculinity and an apotheosised form of femininity that is considered as proper for men and women. This idealised form of masculinity (hegemonic masculinity) legitimates and normalises certain performances of men, and pathologises, marginalises, and subordinates any other expressions of masculinities or femininities (masculine and feminine subject positions). Alongside hegemonic masculinity, Connell postulated that there are other forms of masculinities (marginalised and subordinated), which according to the findings of a plethora of studies are constructed in oppressive ways (Thorne 1993). This is symptomatic of the fact that hegemonic masculinity is relational, which means that it is constructed in relation to and against an Other (emphasised femininity, marginalised and subordinated masculinities).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kostas | first1 = M | year = 2018 | title = Snow White in Hellenic primary classrooms: Children's responses to non-traditional gender discourses | journal = Gender and Education | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 530\u2013548 | doi = 10.1080/09540253.2016.1237619 | url = http://create.canterbury.ac.uk/16529/3/16529_Snow%20White%20in%20the%20Hellenic%20Primary%20Classrooms..pdf }}</ref> In addition to describing forceful articulations of violent masculine identities, hegemonic masculinity has also been used to describe implicit, indirect, or coercive forms of gendered socialisation, enacted through video games, fashion, humour, and so on.<ref>Laurie, Timothy; Hickey-Moody, Anna (2017), \"[https://www.academia.edu/31232852/Masculinity_and_Ridicule Masculinity and ridicule]\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Papenburg | editor-first = Bettina | title = Gender: laughter | pages= 215&ndash;228 | publisher = Macmillan Reference | location = Farmington Hills, Michigan | year = 2017 | isbn = 9780028663265 }}</ref>\n\n====Precarious manhood====\nResearchers have argued that the \"precariousness\" of manhood contributes to traditionally-masculine behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = Jennifer K. | last2 = Vandello | first2 = Joseph A. | title = Precarious manhood and its links to action and aggression | journal = [[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 82\u201386 | doi = 10.1177/0963721411402669 | date = April 2011 | ref = harv | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8e388ea50eefccf3ed156d8ceebff986981c3796 }}</ref> \"Precarious\" means that manhood is not inborn, but must be achieved.

From this perspective, in every social system there is a dominant (hegemonic) and idealised form of masculinity and an apotheosised form of femininity that is considered as proper for men and women. This idealised form of masculinity (hegemonic masculinity) legitimates and normalises certain performances of men, and pathologises, marginalises, and subordinates any other expressions of masculinities or femininities (masculine and feminine subject positions). Alongside hegemonic masculinity, Connell postulated that there are other forms of masculinities (marginalised and subordinated), which according to the findings of a plethora of studies are constructed in oppressive ways (Thorne 1993). This is symptomatic of the fact that hegemonic masculinity is relational, which means that it is constructed in relation to and against an Other (emphasised femininity, marginalised and subordinated masculinities).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kostas | first1 = M | year = 2018 | title = Snow White in Hellenic primary classrooms: Children's responses to non-traditional gender discourses | journal = Gender and Education | volume = 30 | issue = 4| pages = 530\u2013548 | doi = 10.1080/09540253.2016.1237619 | url = http://create.canterbury.ac.uk/16529/3/16529_Snow%20White%20in%20the%20Hellenic%20Primary%20Classrooms..pdf }}</ref> In addition to describing forceful articulations of violent masculine identities, hegemonic masculinity has also been used to describe implicit, indirect, or coercive forms of gendered socialisation, enacted through video games, fashion, humour, and so on.<ref>Laurie, Timothy; Hickey-Moody, Anna (2017), \"[https://www.academia.edu/31232852/Masculinity_and_Ridicule Masculinity and ridicule]\", in {{cite book | editor-last = Papenburg | editor-first = Bettina | title = Gender: laughter | pages= 215&ndash;228 | publisher = Macmillan Reference | location = Farmington Hills, Michigan | year = 2017 | isbn = 9780028663265 }}</ref>\n\n====Precarious manhood====\nResearchers have argued that the \"precariousness\" of manhood contributes to traditionally-masculine behavior.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Bosson | first1 = Jennifer K. | last2 = Vandello | first2 = Joseph A. | title = Precarious manhood and its links to action and aggression | journal = [[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 82\u201386 | doi = 10.1177/0963721411402669 | date = April 2011 | ref = harv | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8e388ea50eefccf3ed156d8ceebff986981c3796 }}</ref> \"Precarious\" means that manhood is not inborn, but must be achieved.

These cults, [[Millenarianism in colonial societies|millenarian]] in nature, were first described in [[Melanesia]] in the wake of contact with more technologically advanced Western cultures. The name derives from the belief which began among Melanesians in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that various ritualistic acts such as the building of an airplane runway will result in the appearance of material wealth, particularly highly desirable Western goods (i.e., \"[[cargo]]\"), via Western airplanes.<ref name=Burridge>{{cite book |last=Burridge |first=Kenelm |title=New Heaven, New Earth: A study of Millenarian Activities |year=1969 |publisher=Basil Blackwell |location=London |page=48}}</ref><ref name=Lindstrom>{{cite book |last=Lindstrom |first=Lamont |title=Cargo Cult: Strange Stories of desire from Melanesia and beyond |year=1993 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Honolulu}}</ref> \n\nCargo cults often develop during a combination of crises. Under conditions of social stress, such a movement may form under the leadership of a charismatic figure. This leader may have a \"[[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]\" (or \"myth-dream\") of the future, often linked to an ancestral efficacy (\"[[mana]]\") thought to be recoverable by a return to traditional morality.<ref name=Burridge/><ref>{{cite book |last=Burridge |first=Kenelm |editor1-last=Lockwood |editor1-first=V.

Early theories of cargo cults began from the assumption that practitioners simply failed to understand technology, colonization, or capitalist reform; in this model, cargo cults are a misunderstanding of the systems involved in resource distribution, and an attempt to acquire such goods in the wake of interrupted trade. However, many of these practitioners actually focus on the importance of sustaining and creating new ''social'' relationships, with material relations being secondary.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Otto|first=Ton|title=What happened to Cargo Cults? Material Religions in Melanesia and the West|journal=Social Analysis|year=2009|volume=53|issue=1|pages=93\u20134}}</ref>\n\nSince the late twentieth century, alternative theories have arisen. For example, some scholars, such as Kaplan and Lindstrom, focus on Europeans' characterization of these movements as a fascination with manufactured goods and what such a focus says about Western [[commodity fetishism]].<ref name=\"Lindstrom\" /> Others point to the need to see each movement as reflecting a particularized historical context, even eschewing the term \"cargo cult\" for them unless there is an attempt to elicit an exchange relationship from Europeans.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Otto |first=Ton |title=What happened to Cargo Cults? Material Religions in Melanesia and the West |journal=Social Analysis |year=2009 |volume=53 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n==Causes, beliefs, and practices==\nCargo cults are marked by a number of common characteristics, including a \"myth-dream\" that is a synthesis  of indigenous and foreign elements; the expectation of help from the ancestors; charismatic leaders; and lastly, belief in the appearance of an abundance of goods.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Otto |first=Ton |title=What happened to Cargo Cults? Material Religions in Melanesia and the West |journal=Social Analysis |year=2009 |volume=53 |issue=1 |page=90 |doi=10.3167/sa.2009.530106}}</ref> The indigenous societies of Melanesia were typically characterized by a \"[[Big man (anthropology)|big man]]\" political system in which individuals gained prestige through gift exchanges. The more wealth a man could distribute, the more people who were in his debt, and the greater his renown. Those who were unable to reciprocate were identified as \"rubbish men\".  Faced, through colonialism, with foreigners with a seemingly unending supply of goods for exchange, indigenous Melanesians experienced \"value dominance\". That is, they were dominated by others in terms of their own (not the foreign) value system; exchange with foreigners left them feeling like rubbish men.<ref name=\"Schwartz-p174\">{{cite book |last=Schwartz |first=Theodore |editor-last=DeVos |editor-first=George A. |title=Responses to Change: Society, Culture, and Personality |year=1976 |chapter=The Cargo Cult: A Melanesian Type-Response to Change |publisher=Van Nostrand |location=New York |isbn=978-0442220945 |page=174}}</ref>\n\nSince the modern manufacturing process is unknown to them, members, leaders, and [[prophet]]s of the cults maintain that the manufactured goods of the non-native culture have been created by spiritual means, such as through their deities and ancestors. These goods are intended for the local indigenous people, but the foreigners have unfairly gained control of these objects through malice or mistake.<ref name=\"harris\">Harris, Marvin. Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches: The Riddles of Culture. New York: Random House, 1974, pg. 133-152</ref> Thus, a characteristic feature of cargo cults is the belief that spiritual agents will, at some future time, give much valuable cargo and desirable manufactured products to the cult members.<ref name=\"harris\"/>\n\nSymbols associated with Christianity and modern Western society tend to be incorporated into their rituals; for example, the use of cross-shaped grave markers. Notable examples of cargo cult activity include the setting up of mock airstrips, airports, airplanes, offices, and dining rooms, as well as the [[fetishization]] and attempted construction of Western goods, such as radios made of coconuts and straw.

A small population of indigenous peoples observed, often directly in front of their dwellings, the largest war ever fought by technologically advanced nations. The [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] arrived first with a great deal of supplies. Later the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] followed.\n\nThe vast amounts of military equipment and supplies that both sides [[airdrop]]ped (or airlifted to airstrips) to troops on these islands meant drastic changes to the lifestyle of the islanders, many of whom had never seen outsiders before.  Manufactured clothing, medicine, canned food, tents, weapons and other goods arrived in vast quantities for the soldiers, who often shared some of it with the islanders who were their guides and hosts. This was true of the Japanese Army as well, at least initially before relations deteriorated in most regions.\n\nThe [[John Frum]] cult, one of the most widely reported and longest-lived, formed on the island of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]], [[Vanuatu]]. This movement started before the war, and became a cargo cult afterwards. Cult members worshiped certain unspecified Americans having the name \"John Frum\" or \"Tom Navy\" whom they claimed had brought cargo to their island during World War II and who they identified as being the spiritual entity who would provide cargo to them in the future.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mercer |first=Phil |title=Cargo cult lives on in South Pacific |date=17 February 2007 |work=[[BBC Online]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6370991.stm}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war===\nWith the end of the war, the military abandoned the airbases and stopped dropping cargo. In response, charismatic individuals developed cults among remote Melanesian populations that promised to bestow on their followers deliveries of food, arms, Jeeps, etc. The cult leaders explained that the cargo would be gifts from their own ancestors, or other sources, as had occurred with the outsider armies. In attempts to get cargo to fall by parachute or land in planes or ships again, islanders imitated the same practices they had seen the [[soldier]]s, [[sailor]]s, and airmen use.

She states that people experience change as dramatic and complete, rather than as gradual and evolutionary. This sense of a dramatic break is expressed through cargo cult ideology.<ref name=\"Otto-p87\" />\n\nLamont Lindstrom takes this analysis one step further through his examination of \"cargoism\", the discourse of the West about cargo cults. His analysis is concerned with Western fascination with the phenomenon in both academic and popular writing. In his opinion, the name \"cargo cult\" is deeply problematic because of its pejorative connotation of backwardness, since it imputes a goal (cargo) obtained through the wrong means (cult); the actual goal is not so much obtaining material goods as creating and renewing social relationships under threat. Martha Kaplan thus argues in favor of erasing the term altogether.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Otto |first=Ton |title=What happened to Cargo Cults?

These cults, [[Millenarianism in colonial societies|millenarian]] in nature, were first described in [[Melanesia]] in the wake of contact with more technologically advanced Western cultures. The name derives from the belief which began among Melanesians in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that various ritualistic acts such as the building of an airplane runway will result in the appearance of material wealth, particularly highly desirable Western goods (i.e., \"[[cargo]]\"), via Western airplanes.<ref name=Burridge>{{cite book |last=Burridge |first=Kenelm |title=New Heaven, New Earth: A study of Millenarian Activities |year=1969 |publisher=Basil Blackwell |location=London |page=48}}</ref><ref name=Lindstrom>{{cite book |last=Lindstrom |first=Lamont |title=Cargo Cult: Strange Stories of desire from Melanesia and beyond |year=1993 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |location=Honolulu}}</ref> \n\nCargo cults often develop during a combination of crises. Under conditions of social stress, such a movement may form under the leadership of a charismatic figure. This leader may have a \"[[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]\" (or \"myth-dream\") of the future, often linked to an ancestral efficacy (\"[[mana]]\") thought to be recoverable by a return to traditional morality.<ref name=Burridge/><ref>{{cite book |last=Burridge |first=Kenelm |editor1-last=Lockwood |editor1-first=V.

Early theories of cargo cults began from the assumption that practitioners simply failed to understand technology, colonization, or capitalist reform; in this model, cargo cults are a misunderstanding of the systems involved in resource distribution, and an attempt to acquire such goods in the wake of interrupted trade. However, many of these practitioners actually focus on the importance of sustaining and creating new ''social'' relationships, with material relations being secondary.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Otto|first=Ton|title=What happened to Cargo Cults? Material Religions in Melanesia and the West|journal=Social Analysis|year=2009|volume=53|issue=1|pages=93\u20134}}</ref>\n\nSince the late twentieth century, alternative theories have arisen. For example, some scholars, such as Kaplan and Lindstrom, focus on Europeans' characterization of these movements as a fascination with manufactured goods and what such a focus says about Western [[commodity fetishism]].<ref name=\"Lindstrom\" /> Others point to the need to see each movement as reflecting a particularized historical context, even eschewing the term \"cargo cult\" for them unless there is an attempt to elicit an exchange relationship from Europeans.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Otto |first=Ton |title=What happened to Cargo Cults? Material Religions in Melanesia and the West |journal=Social Analysis |year=2009 |volume=53 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n==Causes, beliefs, and practices==\nCargo cults are marked by a number of common characteristics, including a \"myth-dream\" that is a synthesis  of indigenous and foreign elements; the expectation of help from the ancestors; charismatic leaders; and lastly, belief in the appearance of an abundance of goods.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Otto |first=Ton |title=What happened to Cargo Cults? Material Religions in Melanesia and the West |journal=Social Analysis |year=2009 |volume=53 |issue=1 |page=90 |doi=10.3167/sa.2009.530106}}</ref> The indigenous societies of Melanesia were typically characterized by a \"[[Big man (anthropology)|big man]]\" political system in which individuals gained prestige through gift exchanges. The more wealth a man could distribute, the more people who were in his debt, and the greater his renown. Those who were unable to reciprocate were identified as \"rubbish men\".  Faced, through colonialism, with foreigners with a seemingly unending supply of goods for exchange, indigenous Melanesians experienced \"value dominance\". That is, they were dominated by others in terms of their own (not the foreign) value system; exchange with foreigners left them feeling like rubbish men.<ref name=\"Schwartz-p174\">{{cite book |last=Schwartz |first=Theodore |editor-last=DeVos |editor-first=George A. |title=Responses to Change: Society, Culture, and Personality |year=1976 |chapter=The Cargo Cult: A Melanesian Type-Response to Change |publisher=Van Nostrand |location=New York |isbn=978-0442220945 |page=174}}</ref>\n\nSince the modern manufacturing process is unknown to them, members, leaders, and [[prophet]]s of the cults maintain that the manufactured goods of the non-native culture have been created by spiritual means, such as through their deities and ancestors. These goods are intended for the local indigenous people, but the foreigners have unfairly gained control of these objects through malice or mistake.<ref name=\"harris\">Harris, Marvin.

Notable examples of cargo cult activity include the setting up of mock airstrips, airports, airplanes, offices, and dining rooms, as well as the [[fetishization]] and attempted construction of Western goods, such as radios made of coconuts and straw. Believers may stage \"drills\" and \"marches\" with sticks for rifles and use military-style insignia and national insignia painted on their bodies to make them look like soldiers, thereby treating the activities of Western military personnel as rituals to be performed for the purpose of attracting the cargo.<ref>{{cite book |last=Burridge |first=Kenelm |title=New Heaven, New Earth: A study of Millenarian Activities |year=1969 |publisher=Basil Blackwell |location=London |pages=65\u201372}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nThe term ''cargo cult'' was first used in print in 1945 by Norris Mervyn Bird, repeating a derogatory description used by planters and businessmen in the Australian [[Territory of Papua]].

She states that people experience change as dramatic and complete, rather than as gradual and evolutionary. This sense of a dramatic break is expressed through cargo cult ideology.<ref name=\"Otto-p87\" />\n\nLamont Lindstrom takes this analysis one step further through his examination of \"cargoism\", the discourse of the West about cargo cults. His analysis is concerned with Western fascination with the phenomenon in both academic and popular writing. In his opinion, the name \"cargo cult\" is deeply problematic because of its pejorative connotation of backwardness, since it imputes a goal (cargo) obtained through the wrong means (cult); the actual goal is not so much obtaining material goods as creating and renewing social relationships under threat. Martha Kaplan thus argues in favor of erasing the term altogether.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Otto |first=Ton |title=What happened to Cargo Cults?

Because the process yields [[Equivalent_(chemistry)|equivalent]] amounts of chlorine and sodium hydroxide (two moles of sodium hydroxide per mole of chlorine), it is necessary to find a use for these products in the same proportion. For every mole of chlorine produced, one mole of hydrogen is produced. Much of this hydrogen is used to produce [[hydrochloric acid]], [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], or is combusted for power and/or steam production.<ref>{{cite book|author1=[[R.

While the [[mercury (element)|mercury]] cell method produces chlorine-free sodium hydroxide, the use of several tonnes of mercury leads to serious environmental problems. In a normal production cycle a few hundred pounds of mercury per year are emitted, which accumulate in the environment. Additionally, the chlorine and sodium hydroxide produced via the mercury-cell chloralkali process are themselves contaminated with trace amounts of mercury. The membrane and diaphragm method use no mercury, but the sodium hydroxide contains chlorine, which must be removed.\n\nThe performance of these devices is governed by the considerations of [[electrochemical engineering]].\n\n===Membrane cell===\nThe most common chloralkali process involves the electrolysis of [[aqueous]] [[sodium chloride]] (a brine) in a [[Sodium hydroxide#Production|membrane cell]]. A membrane, such as one made from [[Nafion#Chlor-alkali_production_cell_membrane|Nafion]], Flemion or Aciplex, is used to prevent the reaction between the chlorine and hydroxide ions.\n\n[[Image:Chloralkali_membrane.svg|thumb|center|upright=3|Basic membrane cell used in the [[electrolysis]] of brine. At the anode ('''A'''), chloride (Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>) is oxidized to chlorine. The ion-selective membrane ('''B''') allows the counterion Na+ to freely flow across, but prevents anions such as hydroxide (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) and chloride from diffusing across. At the cathode ('''C'''), water is reduced to hydroxide and hydrogen gas. The net process is the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of NaCl into industrially useful products sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and chlorine gas.]]\n\nSaturated brine is passed into the first chamber of the cell where the [[chloride]] ions are [[redox|oxidised]] at the [[anode]], losing electrons to become [[chlorine]] gas ('''A''' in figure):\n:2Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 {{chem|Cl|2}} + 2[[electron|e<sup>\u2212</sup>]]\n\nAt the [[cathode]], positive [[hydrogen ion]]s pulled from water molecules are [[redox|reduced]] by the electrons provided by the electrolytic current, to hydrogen gas, releasing [[hydroxide]] ions into the solution ('''C''' in figure):\n:2{{chem|H|2|O}} + 2e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub> + 2OH<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nThe ion-permeable [[ion exchange membrane]] at the center of the cell allows the [[sodium]] ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) to pass to the second chamber where they react with the hydroxide ions to produce [[caustic soda]] (NaOH) ('''B''' in figure).<ref name = Du/> The overall reaction for the electrolysis of brine is thus:\n:2NaCl + 2{{chem|H|2|O}} \u2192 {{chem|Cl|2}} + {{chem|H|2}} + 2NaOH\n\n===Diaphragm cell===\nIn the diaphragm cell process, there are two compartments separated by a permeable diaphragm, often made of [[asbestos|asbestos fibers]]. Brine is introduced into the anode compartment and flows into the cathode compartment. Similarly to the Membrane Cell, chloride ions are oxidized at the anode to produce chlorine, and at the cathode, water is split into caustic soda and hydrogen. The diaphragm prevents the reaction of the caustic soda with the chlorine. A diluted caustic brine leaves the cell. The caustic soda must usually be concentrated to 50% and the salt removed. This is done using an evaporative process with about three tonnes of steam per tonne of caustic soda. The salt separated from the caustic brine can be used to saturate diluted brine. The chlorine contains oxygen and must often be purified by liquefaction and evaporation.\n\n===Mercury cell===\n{{main|Castner\u2013Kellner process}}\n[[File:HgNaOHElectrolysis.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Mercury cell for chloralkali process]]\n\nIn the mercury-cell process, also known as the [[Castner\u2013Kellner process]], a saturated brine solution floats on top of a thin layer of mercury. The mercury is the cathode, where sodium is produced and forms a [[Sodium amalgam|sodium-mercury amalgam]] with the mercury. The amalgam is continuously drawn out of the cell and reacted with water which decomposes the amalgam into sodium hydroxide, hydrogen and mercury. The mercury is recycled into the electrolytic cell. Chlorine is produced at the anode and bubbles out of the cell. Mercury cells are being phased out due to concerns about [[mercury poisoning]] from mercury cell pollution such as occurred in Canada (see [[Ontario Minamata disease]]) and Japan (see [[Minamata disease]]).\n\n==Unpartitioned cell==\nWithout a membrane, the chlorine and hydroxide ions react, and the chlorine [[disproportionation|disproportionates]] to form chloride and [[hypochlorite]] ions:\n:{{chem|Cl|2}} + 2OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> + ClO<sup>\u2212</sup> + {{chem|H|2|O}}\n\nAbove about 60&nbsp;\u00b0C, [[chlorate]] can be formed:\n:3{{chem|Cl|2}} + 6OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 5Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> + {{chem|ClO|3}}<sup>\u2212</sup> + 3{{chem|H|2|O}}\n\nIf current is interrupted while the cathode is submerged, cathodes that are attacked by hypochlorites, such as those made from stainless steel, will [[corrosion|dissolve]] in unpartitioned cells.\n\nIf producing hydrogen and oxygen gases is not a priority, the addition of 0.18% [[Sodium chromate|sodium]] or [[potassium chromate]] to the electrolyte will improve the efficiency of producing the other products.<ref name=\"Thom1911\">{{cite book |title=Applied Electrochemistry |author=Thompson, M. de Kay |publisher=The MacMillan Company |year=1911 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/appliedelectroch00thom/page/89 89]-90 |url=https://archive.org/details/appliedelectroch00thom}}</ref>\n\n==Electrodes==\nDue to the corrosive nature of chlorine production, the anode (where the chlorine is formed) must be non-reactive and has been made from platinum metal<ref name=\"Faraday1849\">{{cite book |last=Faraday |first=Michael |year=1849 |title=Experimental Researches In Electricity |volume=1 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14986/14986-h/14986-h.htm |location=London |publisher=The University of London |author-link=Michael Faraday}}</ref>, graphite (called plumbago in Faraday's time)<ref name=\"Faraday1849\" />, platinized titanium<ref name=\"Land1972\">{{cite journal |title=Anodic chlorate formation on platinized titanium |author=Landolt, D.; Ibl, N. |journal=Journal of Applied Electrochemistry |volume=2 |issue=3 |year=1972 |pages=201-210 |publisher=Chapman and Hall Ltd. |doi=10.1007/BF02354977}}</ref>.

Graphite will slowly disintegrate due to internal electrolytic gas production from the porous nature of the material and carbon dioxide forming due to carbon oxidation, causing fine particles of graphite to be suspended in the electrolyte that can be removed by filtration. The cathode (where hydroxide forms) can be made from unalloyed titanium, graphite, or a more easily oxidized metal such as stainless steel or [[nickel]].\n\n==Laboratory procedure==\nElectrolysis can be done with beakers, one containing a brine solution (salt water) and one containing pure water connected by a [[salt bridge]]. Anodes are made ideally from [[platinum group metal]]s, which resist corrosion.  Since corrosion is less severe at the cathode, it can be stainless steel or silver.\n\n==Manufacturer associations==\nThe interests of chloralkali product manufacturers are represented at regional, national and international levels by associations such as [[Euro Chlor]] and [[World Chlorine Council|The World Chlorine Council]].\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category}}\n* [[Gas diffusion electrode]]\n* [[Electrochemical engineering]]\n* [[Solvay process]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bommaraju, Tilak V.; Orosz, Paul J.; Sokol, Elizabeth A.(2007).
