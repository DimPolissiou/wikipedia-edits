However, few modern Yarsani can read or write Gorani (a Northwestern Iranian language belonging to the branch Zaza-Gorani) as their mother tongues are [[Southern Kurdish]] and [[Sorani]], which belong to the other two branches of the [[Kurdish languages]]. The speakers of Sarli living near [[Al-Hamdaniya District|Eski Kalak]] are adherents.<ref>[[Cecil J.

The followers of Yarsanism perform their rituals and ceremonies in secret, but this has not relieved the harassment of many of the Yarsani by Islamic or other governments over the centuries. The followers of this religion say that after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, pressure on the Yarsani community has increased and they have been deprived and discriminated against for over 30 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/persian/blog-viewpoints-39211631|title=\"discrimination over yarsan\"}}</ref>\n\nOne of the signs of Yarsanic males is the mustache, as the Yarsanic holy book [[Kal\u00e2m-e Saranj\u00e2m]] says that every man must have a mustache to take part in Yarsanic religious rites.{{source needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Beliefs==\n[[File:Tambur.jpg|100px|thumb|right|The [[Kurdish tanbur|Tambur]] is a sacred symbol of Yarsanism and is played during religious  ceremonies]]\nThe Yarsani follow the mystical teachings of [[Sultan Sahak]]. From the Yarsani point of view, the universe is composed of two distinct yet interrelated worlds: the internal (''[[Batin (Islam)|B\u0101tin\u012b]]'') and the external (''[[Zahir (Islam)|z\u0101hir\u012b]]''), each having its own order and rules. Although humans are only aware of the outer world, their lives are governed according to the rules of the inner world. This aspect of the Yarsani faith can be identified as [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[esoterism]] which emerged under the intense influence of [[Batiniyyah|B\u0101tin\u012b]]-[[Sufism]] during the last two centuries.\n\nAmong other important pillars of their belief system are that the Divine Essence has successive manifestations in human form (''mazhariyyat'') and the belief in [[transmigration of the soul]] (''dunaduni'' in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]). Yarasani believe that every man needs to do what is written within their holy book, the [[Kal\u00e2m-e Saranj\u00e2m]], otherwise they are not part of Yarsan. There is no compulsion or exclusion in Yarsan \u2013 anyone who chooses to follow its precepts is welcome.\n\nThe Yarsani faith's features include [[millenarism]], [[Innatism]], [[egalitarianism]], [[metempsychosis]], [[angelology]], divine manifestation and [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]. Many of these features are found in [[Yazidism]], and they also have many things in common with [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] and [[Christianity|Christians]]. Unlike other indigenous Persian faiths, Yarsanism explicitly rejects class, caste and rank, which sets them apart from the [[Yezidis]] and [[Zoroastrians]].<ref name=\"Hamzeh'ee\">{{Cite book |last=Hamzeh'ee |first=M Reza |publication-date=1990 |year=1990 |title=The Yaresan: A Sociological, Historical, and Religio-historical Study of a Kurdish Community |edition= |series=[[Islamkundliche Untersuchungen]] |volume=138 |publication-place=Berlin |publisher=Schwartz |isbn=3-922968-83-X}}</ref>\n\n===Epochs of Evolution===\nAccording to Yarsani philosophy, the universe is evolving in through different Epochs{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}} and that these Epochs are:\n#First Epoch, or ''Shari'at,'' which includes the period from [[Adam and Eve]] until [[Muhammad]], also known as the \"Prophet\" period.\n#Second Epoch, or ''Tariqat,'' which includes the period from [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] until [[Shah Khoshin]], also known as the \"Doctrine\" period.\n#Third Epoch, or ''Marefat'', which includes the period from Shah Khoshin until [[Sultan Sahak]], also known as the \"Mystical\" period.\n#Fourth Epoch, or ''Haqiqat'', which includes the period from [[Sultan Sahak]] until today, also known as the \"Truth\" period.\n\n===Divine manifestations===\nThe Yarsani are [[Emanationism|emanation]]ists and incarnationists, believing that the Divine Essence has successive [[incarnation]]s known as ''mazhariyyats'' (similar to the [[Hindu]] [[avatar]]s). They believe God manifests one primary and seven secondary manifestations in each  epoch of the world, in either angel or human form. These seven persons are known as \"''Haft tan''\" which means \"The Seven Persons\"\n\nThe primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the First Epoch was the Divine Essence known as Khawandagar, who created the world.\n\nThe primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the Second Epoch was [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]], the fourth [[Caliph]] and first imam of [[Shia Islam]]. This explains the alternative name for Yarsanis '''Ali-Allahi''', 'Believers in the divinity of Ali'.\n\nThe primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the Third Epoch was Shah Khoshin.\n\nIn the Fourth Epoch, the primary ''mazhariyyat'' is held to be [[Sultan Sahak]]. It is said that he was given birth by Dayerak Rezbar or Khatun-e Rezbar, a Kurdish virgin, and as in the case of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]], it was a virginal conception. While sleeping under a [[pomegranate]] tree a kernel of fruit fell into her mouth when a bird pecked the fruit directly over her.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Kurds: History and Culture |url=http://www.bakhawan.com/dotkurd/nebez/Inglizi/TheKurds.pdf |page=23 |author=Nebez, Jamal |publisher=Western Kurdistan Association |date=1997-09-19 |accessdate=2006-09-01 |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525152728/http://www.bakhawan.com/dotkurd/nebez/Inglizi/TheKurds.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=2006-05-25 |authorlink=Jamal Nebez}}</ref>\n\n[[File:kakkai.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Kurdish Yarsani men in [[Suleimaniyah]], [[Kurdistan Region]].

He taught mystical doctrines and techniques (''tariqat'') in those lands for almost a hundred years, and then returned to the Guran country.

In the First Epoch they appeared in their true angelic form, while in subsequent Epochs they appeared in human incarnations. The \"''Haft Tan''\" are charged with responsibility for the affairs of the internal realm.\n\nThe secondary ''mazhariyyats''  of the First Epoch include the archangels [[Gabriel]], [[Michael]], [[Israfil]] and [[Azrael]], and a female angelic being. \n\nThe ''mazhariyyats'' of the Second Epoch include Salman, Qanbar, [[Mohammed]], Nusayr (who is either [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] or [[Theophobus]]) and [[Bahlool]]. It also includes [[Fatimah]], the daughter of Mohammed as the incarnation of the female angel.\n\nThe ''mazhariyyats'' of the Third Epoch include [[\u0641\u0636\u0644\u200c\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0646\u0639\u06cc\u0645\u06cc|Shah Fazlullah Veli]], Baba Sarhang Dudani and Baba Naous.\n\nIn the Fourth Epoch, the ''Haft Tan'' or 'seven persons' charged by Sultan Sahak with responsibility for the affairs of the inner realm consist of the following:<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ZMHFaithRitualCultureAmongAH|title=Faith Ritual and Culture Among Ahle-Haqq|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\nThe \"''Haft Tan''\" (The Seven [[Archangels]]) are key figures in the Yarsani belief system and their history.

These traditions are said to have been written down by Pir Musi, one of the seven companions of Sultan Sahak (also the angel in charge of recording human deeds).<ref name=\"mirhosseini\">Z.

The Khandans were established when, along with the ''Haft Tan'', Sultan Sahak also formed the ''Haft Tawane'', a group of seven holy persons charged with the affairs of the outer world.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> They were Say-yed Mohammad, Say-yed Abu'l Wafa, Haji Babusi, Mir Sur, Say-yed Mostafa, Sheykh Shahab al-Din and Sheykh Habib Shah. Each of the ''Haft Tawane'' was charged with responsibility for the guidance of a number of followers, and these followers formed the original seven Khandans, namely Shah Ebrahim, Baba Yadegar, Ali Qalandar, Khamush, Mir Sur, Sey-yed Mosaffa and Hajji Babu Isa. After Sultan Sahak's time another four  khandans were established, namely Atesh Bag, Baba Heydar, Zolnour and Shah Hayas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahle-haqq.com/rituals.html|title=Ahl-e Haqq \u2013 Rituals and Traditions|website=www.ahle-haqq.com}}</ref>\n\nEvery Yarsani therefore belongs to one specific khandan, which is led by a spiritual leader called a say-yed, to whom each member must swear obedience.  The say-yed is the spiritual leader of the community and is normally present during the ceremonies attended by the followers. Say-yeds are the only ones allowed to have full access to the religious texts of Yarsanism, and have traditionally competed with each other to have the largest number of followers. The position of Say-yed is hereditary, being passed down through the generations from the original  founders. As the say-yed are considered spiritual 'parents', it is the tradition for them not to marry their followers.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe majority of Yarsanis are found in the Kurdish areas of Iran and Iraq, especially in [[Hawraman]] and the [[Kermanshah province]] of Iran.\n\n===In Iran===\n{{main|Goran Kurds|Kurdish people}}\nThe Yarsani in Iran are mostly found in [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]] and [[Kermanshah province]]s<ref name=\"auto\"/> There are also large communities of Yarsanis in some regions of [[Iranian Azerbaijan]].

The English translation reads:\n\n{{quote|First of all, we must clear up the confusion resulting from the variety of names given to the sect of \"Ahl\u00e9-Haqq\", which are liable to be misunderstood. Like any religion, the one we are dealing with considers itself to be the only true and orthodox one, and it is natural that its adherents give themselves the name of \"People of Truth\" (''Ahl\u00e9-Haqq'' or ''Ahl\u00e9-Haq\u00eeqat''). This term lacks precision, as other sects, for example the [[Hurufism|Horoufis]], occasionally apply it to themselves. Still, the name Ahl\u00e9-Haqq to refer to the sect of our particular interest has every advantage over appellations such as \"[[Ghulat|Gholat]]\", \"[[Ali-Illahism|Al\u00ee-All\u00e2hi]]\", and \"[[Alawites|Nos\u00e9\u00efri]]\" that the Muslims and most European travellers use in speaking of them. The first term, which encompasses all of the extremist Shi\u2019ites, is too broad and too vague. The second term, \"deifiers of Ali\", has the same fault and emphasizes what is only a detail in the religious system under discussion. Finally, the name \"[[Nusairi|Nos\u00e9\u00efri]]\" belongs to that well-defined Syrian religion, which, despite some resemblances with the doctrines of the Ahl\u00e9-Haqq (the worship of Ali, the communion, etc.), appears to present a complex of quite different old beliefs.}}\n\n===Relations with Islam===\n''Ahl-e Haqq'' view Islam as a product of a cycle of divine essence, which was made manifest in [[Ali]], and established the stage of [[Sharia|''shai'at'']] (Islamic law). This was followed by the cycle of [[Tariqa|''tariqat'']] (Sufi teachings), then ''[[ma'rifa]]t'' (Sufi gnosis), and finally the current cycle of [[haqiqa]]t (Ultimate Truth), which was made manifest in [[Sultan Sahak]]. The final stage supersedes the previous ones, which frees Ahl-e Haqq from observing the shari'a rules incumbent on Muslims. Ahl-i Haqq class other Muslims as either Ahl-i Tashayyu (followers of Shi'ism) or Ahl-i Tasannun (followers of Sunnism). The Ahl-i Haqq neither observe Muslim rites, such as daily prayers and fasting during the month of Ramadan, nor share Islamic theology and sacred space, such as belief in the day of resurrection and sanctity of the mosque.<ref>Z.

From the Yarsani point of view, the universe is composed of two distinct yet interrelated worlds: the internal (''[[Batin (Islam)|B\u0101tin\u012b]]'') and the external (''[[Zahir (Islam)|z\u0101hir\u012b]]''), each having its own order and rules. Although humans are only aware of the outer world, their lives are governed according to the rules of the inner world. This aspect of the Yarsani faith can be identified as [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[esoterism]] which emerged under the intense influence of [[Batiniyyah|B\u0101tin\u012b]]-[[Sufism]] during the last two centuries.\n\nAmong other important pillars of their belief system are that the Divine Essence has successive manifestations in human form (''mazhariyyat'') and the belief in [[transmigration of the soul]] (''dunaduni'' in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]). Yarasani believe that every man needs to do what is written within their holy book, the [[Kal\u00e2m-e Saranj\u00e2m]], otherwise they are not part of Yarsan. There is no compulsion or exclusion in Yarsan \u2013 anyone who chooses to follow its precepts is welcome.\n\nThe Yarsani faith's features include [[millenarism]], [[Innatism]], [[egalitarianism]], [[metempsychosis]], [[angelology]], divine manifestation and [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]. Many of these features are found in [[Yazidism]], and they also have many things in common with [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]] and [[Christianity|Christians]]. Unlike other indigenous Persian faiths, Yarsanism explicitly rejects class, caste and rank, which sets them apart from the [[Yezidis]] and [[Zoroastrians]].<ref name=\"Hamzeh'ee\">{{Cite book |last=Hamzeh'ee |first=M Reza |publication-date=1990 |year=1990 |title=The Yaresan: A Sociological, Historical, and Religio-historical Study of a Kurdish Community |edition= |series=[[Islamkundliche Untersuchungen]] |volume=138 |publication-place=Berlin |publisher=Schwartz |isbn=3-922968-83-X}}</ref>\n\n===Epochs of Evolution===\nAccording to Yarsani philosophy, the universe is evolving in through different Epochs{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}} and that these Epochs are:\n#First Epoch, or ''Shari'at,'' which includes the period from [[Adam and Eve]] until [[Muhammad]], also known as the \"Prophet\" period.\n#Second Epoch, or ''Tariqat,'' which includes the period from [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] until [[Shah Khoshin]], also known as the \"Doctrine\" period.\n#Third Epoch, or ''Marefat'', which includes the period from Shah Khoshin until [[Sultan Sahak]], also known as the \"Mystical\" period.\n#Fourth Epoch, or ''Haqiqat'', which includes the period from [[Sultan Sahak]] until today, also known as the \"Truth\" period.\n\n===Divine manifestations===\nThe Yarsani are [[Emanationism|emanation]]ists and incarnationists, believing that the Divine Essence has successive [[incarnation]]s known as ''mazhariyyats'' (similar to the [[Hindu]] [[avatar]]s). They believe God manifests one primary and seven secondary manifestations in each  epoch of the world, in either angel or human form. These seven persons are known as \"''Haft tan''\" which means \"The Seven Persons\"\n\nThe primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the First Epoch was the Divine Essence known as Khawandagar, who created the world.\n\nThe primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the Second Epoch was [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]], the fourth [[Caliph]] and first imam of [[Shia Islam]]. This explains the alternative name for Yarsanis '''Ali-Allahi''', 'Believers in the divinity of Ali'.\n\nThe primary ''mazhariyyat'' of the Third Epoch was Shah Khoshin.\n\nIn the Fourth Epoch, the primary ''mazhariyyat'' is held to be [[Sultan Sahak]]. It is said that he was given birth by Dayerak Rezbar or Khatun-e Rezbar, a Kurdish virgin, and as in the case of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Mary]], it was a virginal conception.

The Khandans were established when, along with the ''Haft Tan'', Sultan Sahak also formed the ''Haft Tawane'', a group of seven holy persons charged with the affairs of the outer world.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> They were Say-yed Mohammad, Say-yed Abu'l Wafa, Haji Babusi, Mir Sur, Say-yed Mostafa, Sheykh Shahab al-Din and Sheykh Habib Shah. Each of the ''Haft Tawane'' was charged with responsibility for the guidance of a number of followers, and these followers formed the original seven Khandans, namely Shah Ebrahim, Baba Yadegar, Ali Qalandar, Khamush, Mir Sur, Sey-yed Mosaffa and Hajji Babu Isa. After Sultan Sahak's time another four  khandans were established, namely Atesh Bag, Baba Heydar, Zolnour and Shah Hayas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahle-haqq.com/rituals.html|title=Ahl-e Haqq \u2013 Rituals and Traditions|website=www.ahle-haqq.com}}</ref>\n\nEvery Yarsani therefore belongs to one specific khandan, which is led by a spiritual leader called a say-yed, to whom each member must swear obedience.  The say-yed is the spiritual leader of the community and is normally present during the ceremonies attended by the followers. Say-yeds are the only ones allowed to have full access to the religious texts of Yarsanism, and have traditionally competed with each other to have the largest number of followers. The position of Say-yed is hereditary, being passed down through the generations from the original  founders. As the say-yed are considered spiritual 'parents', it is the tradition for them not to marry their followers.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe majority of Yarsanis are found in the Kurdish areas of Iran and Iraq, especially in [[Hawraman]] and the [[Kermanshah province]] of Iran.\n\n===In Iran===\n{{main|Goran Kurds|Kurdish people}}\nThe Yarsani in Iran are mostly found in [[Lorestan Province|Lorestan]] and [[Kermanshah province]]s<ref name=\"auto\"/> There are also large communities of Yarsanis in some regions of [[Iranian Azerbaijan]].

The English translation reads:\n\n{{quote|First of all, we must clear up the confusion resulting from the variety of names given to the sect of \"Ahl\u00e9-Haqq\", which are liable to be misunderstood. Like any religion, the one we are dealing with considers itself to be the only true and orthodox one, and it is natural that its adherents give themselves the name of \"People of Truth\" (''Ahl\u00e9-Haqq'' or ''Ahl\u00e9-Haq\u00eeqat''). This term lacks precision, as other sects, for example the [[Hurufism|Horoufis]], occasionally apply it to themselves. Still, the name Ahl\u00e9-Haqq to refer to the sect of our particular interest has every advantage over appellations such as \"[[Ghulat|Gholat]]\", \"[[Ali-Illahism|Al\u00ee-All\u00e2hi]]\", and \"[[Alawites|Nos\u00e9\u00efri]]\" that the Muslims and most European travellers use in speaking of them. The first term, which encompasses all of the extremist Shi\u2019ites, is too broad and too vague. The second term, \"deifiers of Ali\", has the same fault and emphasizes what is only a detail in the religious system under discussion. Finally, the name \"[[Nusairi|Nos\u00e9\u00efri]]\" belongs to that well-defined Syrian religion, which, despite some resemblances with the doctrines of the Ahl\u00e9-Haqq (the worship of Ali, the communion, etc.), appears to present a complex of quite different old beliefs.}}\n\n===Relations with Islam===\n''Ahl-e Haqq'' view Islam as a product of a cycle of divine essence, which was made manifest in [[Ali]], and established the stage of [[Sharia|''shai'at'']] (Islamic law). This was followed by the cycle of [[Tariqa|''tariqat'']] (Sufi teachings), then ''[[ma'rifa]]t'' (Sufi gnosis), and finally the current cycle of [[haqiqa]]t (Ultimate Truth), which was made manifest in [[Sultan Sahak]]. The final stage supersedes the previous ones, which frees Ahl-e Haqq from observing the shari'a rules incumbent on Muslims. Ahl-i Haqq class other Muslims as either Ahl-i Tashayyu (followers of Shi'ism) or Ahl-i Tasannun (followers of Sunnism). The Ahl-i Haqq neither observe Muslim rites, such as daily prayers and fasting during the month of Ramadan, nor share Islamic theology and sacred space, such as belief in the day of resurrection and sanctity of the mosque.<ref>Z.

The First Conscription Act of Act of April 26, 1862 made all white men, 18 to 35 years old, available for military service during three years. The Second Conscription Act of September 27, 1862 extended the age limit to 45 years of age, while the Third Conscription Act of February 17, 1864 made all white men, 17 to 50 years old, available for military service for an unlimited period. Anyone drafted for military service had the right to hire a man to serve in his stead. This provision was heavily criticized, and eventually it was abolished on December 28, 1863. An act of April 21, 1862 exempted persons in a number of reserved occupations from the draft. On October 11, 1862, a new exemption act, soon dubbed the [[Twenty Negro Law]], was approved. The Third Conscription limited the number of reserved occupations, but, although much criticized, kept the \"Twenty Negro Law\" in modified form. In order to encourage volunteering the First Act allowed existing regiments to elect new officers. The Third Act also allowed officer election in regiments formed by the new age groups coming into military service.<ref name=Lead>This lead is a summary of the article. Citations are found in the main text.</ref>\n[[File:Unidentified young soldier in Confederate infantry uniform.jpg|thumb|right|Young Confederate soldier.]]\nThe debate over conscription was but one facet of the political struggle in the Confederacy between the critics of centralized power, who saw conscription, suspension of Habeas Corpus, and other actions of the Confederate government as a threat to fundamental freedoms, and the defenders of these actions, who saw a strong central government, and especially a powerful executive, as essential for the maintenance of Southern independence in face of large Union armies bent on destroying it. Draft evasion took many forms, from legislative action in several states, to legal actions in state courts, to running away and sitting the war out in hiding, to forming armed bands that violently resisted conscription officers and other agents of the Confederate government, to raising the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and stripes]] and declaring for the [[United States|United States government]]. By 1864 the Southern draft had become virtually unenforceable.<ref name=Lead/>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Corporal Abel Hoyle Gantt and Private Marcus A. Gantt of Co. F, 34th North Carolina Infantry.jpg|thumb|Two brothers from [[34th North Carolina Infantry Regiment]] who volunteered in the spring of 1861.]]\nAbout half of the soldiers that enlisted in the [[Provisional Army of the Confederate States]] in the spring of 1861, did it for a period of three years. But the other half enlisted only for a one-year period. At the end of 1861, the Confederate authorities, realizing that the end of the war was nowhere in sight, faced the loss of half the army within some months; the enlistment period of 148 regiments were to expire in March, 1862.<ref>Cline 2014, p. 16.</ref> \n\nIn December, the [[Confederate Congress]] tried to induce reenlistment by offering [[Bounty (reward)|bounties]], a sixty-day [[furlough]], and the option of joining new regiments with new elections of the officers. Lee pronounced this disastrous, and argued compulsory conscription was essential to win the war. In April 1862, Congress enacted the first conscription act in American history.<ref>McPherson 1990, pp. 429-430.</ref>\n\n==Eligibility for military service==\nThe Act of April 16, 1862<ref>\"An Act to further provide for the public defence\", approved April 16, 1862. Mathews 1862, pp. 29-32.</ref> made all white men, 18 to 35 years old, available for military service during three years. The one-year volunteers saw their enlistment period extended with two years. The draft would be administered by the [[Confederate Secretary of War]] who would establish draft quotas for the several states of the Confederacy. On September 27, 1862,<ref>\"An Act to amend an Act entitled 'An Act to provide further for the public defence,' \" approved September 27, 1862. Mathews 1862a, p. 62.</ref> the Congress extended the age limit to 45 years of age and on  February 17, 1864<ref name=\"Act1864\">\"An Act to organize forces to serve during the war,\" approved February 17, 1864. Mathews 1864, pp. 211-215.</ref> all white men, 17 to 50 years old, became available for military service for an unlimited period, i.e. \"for the war\", although those 17 to 18 years and 45 to 50 years old, would constitute a state defense reserve, not serving outside their resident state.<ref>White 2011, pp. 542-544, 547.</ref>\n\n==Substitution for military service==\nAnyone drafted for military service had the right to hire a man to serve in his stead. The substitute could not be a person available for military service under the Conscription Act, and had to be fit for duty. This provision was heavily criticized, and eventually the Congress abolished it on December 28, 1863.<ref>\"An Act to prevent the enlistment or enrollment of substitutes in the military service of the Confederate States,\" approved December 28, 1863. Mathews 1864, pp. 172.</ref> On January 5, 1864,<ref>\"An Act to put an end to the exemption from military service of those who have heretofore furnished substitutes,\" approved January 5, 1864. Mathews 1864, pp. 172.</ref> those who had hired substitutes became eligible for the draft.<ref>White 2011, pp. 543-544.</ref>\n\n==Exemptions from military service==\nIn order to sustain a civil society as well as maintain production of munitions of war, an act of April 21, 1862<ref name=Exemption62>\"An Act to exempt certain persons from enrollment for service in the armies of the Confederate States.\" Approved April 21, 1862. Mathews 1862, pp. 51-52.</ref> exempted persons in a number of [[reserved occupation]]s from the draft. Among those exempted were confederate and state officials, [[Minister (Christianity)|Christian Ministers]], professors and teachers, [[druggist]]s, [[Orderly|hospital attendants]], mine, foundry, cotton and wool factory workers. On October 11, 1862,<ref name=Exemption62a>\"An Act to exempt certain persons from military service, and to repeal an act entitled 'An Act to exempt certain persons from enrollment for service in the army of the Confederate States,' approved April 21, 1862.\" Approved October 11, 1862. Mathews 1862a, pp. 77-78.</ref> a new exemption act was approved, among other changes it also exempted  [[Plantations in the American South#Overseer|overseer]]s on [[plantation]]s with more than 20 [[slave]]s. When, on February 17, 1864,<ref name=\"Act1864\"/> the Congress extended the draft to men 50 years of age, it also limited the number of reserved occupations.<ref>White 2011, pp. 545, 547.</ref>\n\n==Election of officers==\n[[File:Confederate cavalry general Fitzhugh Lee (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Fitzhugh Lee]] was elected colonel of [[1st Virginia Cavalry]] in elections mandated by the First Conscription Act.<ref>Ramage 2010, p. 45.</ref>]]\nOne aim of the Act of 1862 was to encourage volunteering; hence each existing regiments were allowed to elect new officers, 40 days after the Conscription Act went into effect. Men eligible for the draft could volunteer to a regiment of their choice and participate in the officer election, provided they did it within the 40 days. Those drafted would be assigned regiments without say of the draftees.<ref>White 2011, p. 542.</ref>\n\nSimilar directives were issued pertaining to the new classes of men eligible for military service under the Act of February 17, 1864 (see above). They could within 30 days, east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], and within 60 days east of the river, form volunteer companies and elect their own officers, and serve as [[minutemen]]. Those not volunteering would still be formed into companies and regiments, electing their own company and regimental officers.<ref name=\"Act1864\"/>\n\n==Debate over conscription==\nThe original proposition for a Confederate draft came from [[Robert E. Lee]]. With approval of  President [[Jefferson Davis]], Lee detailed Captain [[Charles Marshall (colonel)|Charles Marshall]] of his staff to draw up the text for a proposed [[conscription]] act.<ref>Thomas 1997, p. 219.</ref> President Davis thought a draft was the only available solution to the Confederate military manpower crisis. Compulsory military recruitment would also ensure that the burden of defending the South fell on all citizens, not just the most [[wikt:patriot|patriot]]ic members of society.<ref>Cline 2014, pp. 16-17.</ref> But not all Confederate congressmen agreed with the president. Texas senator [[William Simpson Oldham Sr.|William Simpson Oldham]], claimed that  draft would call in question the courage and individualism of the Southern people, while threatening the Southern society with military centralization and [[despotism]] of European proportions.<ref>Cooper 2001, p. 499.</ref> Yet, military necessity made the act easily pass both houses, and it became law on April 16, 1862.<ref>Cline 2014, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe First Conscription Act was also severely criticized by many adherents of traditional [[Jeffersonian democracy]] outside of Congress. Among them was one of the most obstreperous critics of the Confederate government's centralization of power during the Civil War, Governor [[Joseph E. Brown]] of [[Georgia in the American Civil War|Georgia]]. He regarded the Act [[unconstitutional]], since the [[Confederate Constitution]] did not explicitly grant the government the power to introduce universal military service. According to [[James M. McPherson]], President Davis answered his Jeffersonian critics with traditional [[Federalist party|Federalist]] arguments; conscription was \"necessary and proper\" in order to effectuate the constitutional mandate for the government to provide for the common defense.<ref>McPherson 1990, p. 433.</ref> Other critics, like [[Alabama in the American Civil War|Alabama]] governor [[John Gill Shorter]], faulted the draft on moral grounds; the Southern cause cold only be saved by the sacrifices of liberty loving men. For the other Texas senator, [[Louis Wigfall]], such talk was useless; \"We must have the heavy battalions\".<ref>Rable 1994, p. 139.</ref>\n\nThe Second Conscription Act speedily sailed through Congress; introduced on August 18, it was passed on September 27, 1862. Only Senators Oldham of Texas and [[James Lawrence Orr|Orr]] of South Carolina voted against it in the senate. Although [[Caleb Claiborne Herbert|Caleb Herbert]] of Texas severely denounced the act in the House, two of his Texas colleagues rejected his claim to speak for Texas, and maintained that the people of the state understood the need for a draft and that the time for constitutional doubts was long gone. The Third Conscription Act of  February 17, 1864 was passed without serious opposition. Senator Wigfall of Texas and others demanded an even more extensive draft. Outside of Congress, however, the clamor against conscription rose to new heights.  [[Vice President of the Confederate States of America|Vice President]] [[Alexander H. Stephens|Alexander Stephens]], supported by [[Robert Toombs]], declared the draft useless and unconstitutional.<ref>Rable 1994, p. 155, 248-349.</ref>\n\nThe debate over conscription was but one facet of the political struggle in the Confederacy between the critics of centralized power, who saw conscription, suspension of [[Habeas Corpus]] and other actions of the Confederate government as a threat to fundamental freedoms, and the defenders of these actions, who saw a strong central government, and especially a powerful executive, as essential for the maintenance of Southern independence in face of large Union armies bent on destroying it.<ref>Rable 1994, p. 140.</ref><ref name=Cooper498/> Most of the critics had their political base in states like Georgia or [[South Carolina in the American Civil War|South Carolina]], quite removed from serious military operations. The most stringent defenders of strong military legislation, on the other hand, were Congressmen and Senators elected from [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky]] and [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]], virtually exiled from their Union-occupied and severely divided home states.<ref name=Cooper498>Cooper 2001, p. 498.</ref>\n\n==Resistance to conscription==\n[[File:Resistance to Confederate conscription.jpg|thumb|left|A Confederate anti-conscription print]]\nSubstitution and the  Exemption Act of October 11, 1862, soon dubbed the [[Twenty Negro Law]], created hostile reactions from the poorer members of the Southern society and spread from drafted recruits into the army, causing concern for the morale of the fighting men. While substitution eventually was abolished, the presence of white males on the plantations was seen as indispensable in a slave society. The concerns were not only about maintaining the productivity of the enslaved labor, but also for the perceived need to protect white women from black males.<ref>Cooper 2001, pp. 479-480, 511.</ref>\n\nThe discontent became widespread and even found its way into the political elite. The [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|North Carolina]] legislature wanted the \"Twenty Negro Law\" repealed as a privilege for the rich.<ref>Rable 1994, p. 156.</ref> The anti-war feelings were strong in the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] region of the state and conscription was one of its major causes. While criticizing President Davis, Governor [[Zebulon Baird Vance|Zebulon Vance]] managed to keep his state in line, preventing any serious threat to the war effort. Neither was the political opposition in Georgia a serious threat to Confederate military policy, in spite of Governor Brown's loud pronouncements. He was successful in manipulating the system in order to exempt all the state's civil and military officials from conscription. Yet, when he tried to build an opposition block in the state, with the support of Vice President Alexander Stephens and Robert Toombs, he failed.<ref>Cooper 2001, pp. 511-513</ref>\n\nFrom 1863 several states enacted laws protecting civil and military officials of the state from the conscription. Both North Carolina and [[Mississippi in the American Civil War|Mississippi]] exempted almost every state, county and militia officer. Such laws were generally upheld by the state courts. Attempts to have the courts issue [[Writ of Habeas Corpus|writs of ''Habeas Corpus'']] in order to free men drafted into the Confederate Army failed, however, in all states but North Carolina. In Georgia, the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|State supreme court]] upheld the constitutionally of the conscription, in a ruling that was attacked by Governor Brown, but defended by the legislature. The [[North Carolina Supreme Court]], though, did not hesitate to issue writs of ''Habeas Corpus'' on behalf of draftees, and declared that State courts had [[concurrent jurisdiction]] with the Confederate courts in such cases. Yet, the Secretary of War refused to accept the courts decisions.<ref>Rable 1994, pp. 199-200, 262.</ref>\n\nFarmers in the North Carolina [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] saw their lives severely disrupted by the draft. Three years in the army meant severe hardships for their families as well as a risk of losing the improvements they had made on their farms. At public meetings they expressed their opposition to the several conscription acts. Once forced into the army, many did not stay; [[desertion]] became rampant. Having returned to their homes, they created secret self-defense groups in order to stay out of the army. Local [[home guard]]s were tasked with apprehending deserters, but community resistance made their missions difficult and at the end of the war 12,000 North Carolinians had run away from the Confederate army (about ten percent of the total serving force from the state). In the poor mountain area of the state, armed resistance group displayed their strength. While the draft resisting farmers of the Piedmont still identified with the Southern cause, although balking at the extreme actions of the Confederate government, the mountain people rejected the whole concept of being governed by what they perceived as a slave-owning [[oligarchy]].

The First Conscription Act of Act of April 26, 1862 made all white men, 18 to 35 years old, available for military service during three years. The Second Conscription Act of September 27, 1862 extended the age limit to 45 years of age, while the Third Conscription Act of February 17, 1864 made all white men, 17 to 50 years old, available for military service for an unlimited period. Anyone drafted for military service had the right to hire a man to serve in his stead. This provision was heavily criticized, and eventually it was abolished on December 28, 1863. An act of April 21, 1862 exempted persons in a number of reserved occupations from the draft. On October 11, 1862, a new exemption act, soon dubbed the [[Twenty Negro Law]], was approved. The Third Conscription limited the number of reserved occupations, but, although much criticized, kept the \"Twenty Negro Law\" in modified form. In order to encourage volunteering the First Act allowed existing regiments to elect new officers. The Third Act also allowed officer election in regiments formed by the new age groups coming into military service.<ref name=Lead>This lead is a summary of the article. Citations are found in the main text.</ref>\n[[File:Unidentified young soldier in Confederate infantry uniform.jpg|thumb|right|Young Confederate soldier.]]\nThe debate over conscription was but one facet of the political struggle in the Confederacy between the critics of centralized power, who saw conscription, suspension of Habeas Corpus, and other actions of the Confederate government as a threat to fundamental freedoms, and the defenders of these actions, who saw a strong central government, and especially a powerful executive, as essential for the maintenance of Southern independence in face of large Union armies bent on destroying it. Draft evasion took many forms, from legislative action in several states, to legal actions in state courts, to running away and sitting the war out in hiding, to forming armed bands that violently resisted conscription officers and other agents of the Confederate government, to raising the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and stripes]] and declaring for the [[United States|United States government]]. By 1864 the Southern draft had become virtually unenforceable.<ref name=Lead/>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Corporal Abel Hoyle Gantt and Private Marcus A. Gantt of Co. F, 34th North Carolina Infantry.jpg|thumb|Two brothers from [[34th North Carolina Infantry Regiment]] who volunteered in the spring of 1861.]]\nAbout half of the soldiers that enlisted in the [[Provisional Army of the Confederate States]] in the spring of 1861, did it for a period of three years. But the other half enlisted only for a one-year period. At the end of 1861, the Confederate authorities, realizing that the end of the war was nowhere in sight, faced the loss of half the army within some months; the enlistment period of 148 regiments were to expire in March, 1862.<ref>Cline 2014, p. 16.</ref> \n\nIn December, the the [[Confederate Congress]] tried to induce reenlistment by offering [[Bounty (reward)|bounties]], a sixty-day [[furlough]], and the option of joining new regiments with new elections of the officers. Lee pronounced this disastrous, and argued compulsory conscription was essential to win the war. In April 1862, Congress enacted the first conscription act in American history.<ref>McPherson 1990, pp. 429-430.</ref>\n\n==Eligibility for military service==\nThe Act of April 16, 1862<ref>\"An Act to further provide for the public defence\", approved April 16, 1862. Mathews 1862, pp. 29-32.</ref> made all white men, 18 to 35 years old, available for military service during three years. The one-year volunteers saw their enlistment period extended with two years. The draft would be administered by the [[Confederate Secretary of War]] who would establish draft quotas for the several states of the Confederacy. On September 27, 1862,<ref>\"An Act to amend an Act entitled 'An Act to provide further for the public defence,' \" approved September 27, 1862. Mathews 1862a, p. 62.</ref> the Congress extended the age limit to 45 years of age and on  February 17, 1864<ref name=\"Act1864\">\"An Act to organize forces to serve during the war,\" approved February 17, 1864.

The substitute could not be a person available for military service under the Conscription Act, and had to be fit for duty. This provision was heavily criticized, and eventually the Congress abolished it on December 28, 1863.<ref>\"An Act to prevent the enlistment or enrollment of substitutes in the military service of the Confederate States,\" approved December 28, 1863.

Mathews 1862, pp. 51-52.</ref> exempted persons in a number of [[reserved occupation]]s from the draft. Among those exempted were confederate and state officials, [[Minister (Christianity)|Christian Ministers]], professors and teachers, [[druggist]]s, [[Orderly|hospital attendants]], mine, foundry, cotton and wool factory workers. On October 11, 1862,<ref name=Exemption62a>\"An Act to exempt certain persons from military service, and to repeal an act entitled 'An Act to exempt certain persons from enrollment for service in the army of the Confederate States,' approved April 21, 1862.\" Approved October 11, 1862.

When, on February 17, 1864,<ref name=\"Act1864\"/> the Congress extended the draft to men 50 years of age, it also limited the number of reserved occupations.<ref>White 2011, pp. 545, 547.</ref>\n\n==Election of officers==\n[[File:Confederate cavalry general Fitzhugh Lee (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Fitzhugh Lee]] was elected colonel of [[1st Virginia Cavalry]] in elections mandated by the First Conscription Act.<ref>Ramage 2010, p. 45.</ref>]]\nOne aim of the Act of 1862 was to encourage volunteering; hence each existing regiments were allowed to elect new officers, 40 days after the Conscription Act went into effect. Men eligible for the draft could volunteer to a regiment of their choice and participate in the officer election, provided they did it within the 40 days. Those drafted would be assigned regiments without say of the draftees.<ref>White 2011, p. 542.</ref>\n\nSimilar directives were issued pertaining to the new classes of men eligible for military service under the Act of February 17, 1864 (see above). They could within 30 days, east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], and within 60 days east of the river, form volunteer companies and elect their own officers, and serve as [[minutemen]]. Those not volunteering would still be formed into companies and regiments, electing their own company and regimental officers.<ref name=\"Act1864\"/>\n\n==Debate over conscription==\nThe original proposition for a Confederate draft came from [[Robert E. Lee]]. With approval of  President [[Jefferson Davis]], Lee detailed Captain [[Charles Marshall (colonel)|Charles Marshall]] of his staff to draw up the text for a proposed [[conscription]] act.<ref>Thomas 1997, p. 219.</ref> President Davis thought a draft was the only available solution to the Confederate military manpower crisis. Compulsory military recruitment would also ensure that the burden of defending the South fell on all citizens, not just the most [[wikt:patriot|patriot]]ic members of society.<ref>Cline 2014, pp. 16-17.</ref> But not all Confederate congressmen agreed with the president. Texas senator [[William Simpson Oldham Sr.|William Simpson Oldham]], claimed that  draft would call in question the courage and individualism of the Southern people, while threatening the Southern society with military centralization and [[despotism]] of European proportions.<ref>Cooper 2001, p. 499.</ref> Yet, military necessity made the act easily pass both houses, and it became law on April 16, 1862.<ref>Cline 2014, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe First Conscription Act was also severely criticized by many adherents of traditional [[Jeffersonian democracy]] outside of Congress. Among them was one of the most obstreperous critics of the Confederate government's centralization of power during the Civil War, Governor [[Joseph E. Brown]] of [[Georgia in the American Civil War|Georgia]]. He regarded the Act [[unconstitutional]], since the [[Confederate Constitution]] did not explicitly grant the government the power to introduce universal military service. According to [[James M. McPherson]], President Davis answered his Jeffersonian critics with traditional [[Federalist party|Federalist]] arguments; conscription was \"necessary and proper\" in order to effectuate the constitutional mandate for the government to provide for the common defense.<ref>McPherson 1990, p. 433.</ref> Other critics, like [[Alabama in the American Civil War|Alabama]] governor [[John Gill Shorter]], faulted the draft on moral grounds; the Southern cause cold only be saved by the sacrifices of liberty loving men. For the other Texas senator, [[Louis Wigfall]], such talk was useless; \"We must have the heavy battalions\".<ref>Rable 1994, p. 139.</ref>\n\nThe Second Conscription Act speedily sailed through Congress; introduced on August 18, it was passed on September 27, 1862. Only Senators Oldham of Texas and [[James Lawrence Orr|Orr]] of South Carolina voted against it in the senate. Although [[Caleb Claiborne Herbert|Caleb Herbert]] of Texas severely denounced the act in the House, two of his Texas colleagues rejected his claim to speak for Texas, and maintained that the people of the state understood the need for a draft and that the time for constitutional doubts was long gone. The Third Conscription Act of  February 17, 1864 was passed without serious opposition. Senator Wigfall of Texas and others demanded an even more extensive draft. Outside of Congress, however, the clamor against conscription rose to new heights.  [[Vice President of the Confederate States of America|Vice President]] [[Alexander H. Stephens|Alexander Stephens]], supported by [[Robert Toombs]], declared the draft useless and unconstitutional.<ref>Rable 1994, p. 155, 248-349.</ref>\n\nThe debate over conscription was but one facet of the political struggle in the Confederacy between the critics of centralized power, who saw conscription, suspension of [[Habeas Corpus]] and other actions of the Confederate government as a threat to fundamental freedoms, and the defenders of these actions, who saw a strong central government, and especially a powerful executive, as essential for the maintenance of Southern independence in face of large Union armies bent on destroying it.<ref>Rable 1994, p. 140.</ref><ref name=Cooper498/> Most of the critics had their political base in states like Georgia or [[South Carolina in the American Civil War|South Carolina]], quite removed from serious military operations. The most stringent defenders of strong military legislation, on the other hand, were Congressmen and Senators elected from [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky]] and [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]], virtually exiled from their Union-occupied and severely divided home states.<ref name=Cooper498>Cooper 2001, p. 498.</ref>\n\n==Resistance to conscription==\n[[File:Resistance to Confederate conscription.jpg|thumb|left|A Confederate anti-conscription print]]\nSubstitution and the  Exemption Act of October 11, 1862, soon dubbed the [[Twenty Negro Law]], created hostile reactions from the poorer members of the Southern society and spread from drafted recruits into the army, causing concern for the morale of the fighting men. While substitution eventually was abolished, the presence of white males on the plantations was seen as indispensable in a slave society. The concerns were not only about maintaining the productivity of the enslaved labor, but also for the perceived need to protect white women from black males.<ref>Cooper 2001, pp. 479-480, 511.</ref>\n\nThe discontent became widespread and even found its way into the political elite. The [[North Carolina in the American Civil War|North Carolina]] legislature wanted the \"Twenty Negro Law\" repealed as a privilege for the rich.<ref>Rable 1994, p. 156.</ref> The anti-war feelings were strong in the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] region of the state and conscription was one of its major causes. While criticizing President Davis, Governor [[Zebulon Baird Vance|Zebulon Vance]] managed to keep his state in line, preventing any serious threat to the war effort. Neither was the political opposition in Georgia a serious threat to Confederate military policy, in spite of Governor Brown's loud pronouncements. He was successful in manipulating the system in order to exempt all the state's civil and military officials from conscription. Yet, when he tried to build an opposition block in the state, with the support of Vice President Alexander Stephens and Robert Toombs, he failed.<ref>Cooper 2001, pp. 511-513</ref>\n\nFrom 1863 several states enacted laws protecting civil and military officials of the state from the conscription. Both North Carolina and [[Mississippi in the American Civil War|Mississippi]] exempted almost every state, county and militia officer. Such laws were generally upheld by the state courts. Attempts to have the courts issue [[Writ of Habeas Corpus|writs of ''Habeas Corpus'']] in order to free men drafted into the Confederate Army failed, however, in all states but North Carolina. In Georgia, the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|State supreme court]] upheld the constitutionally of the conscription, in a ruling that was attacked by Governor Brown, but defended by the legislature. The [[North Carolina Supreme Court]], though, did not hesitate to issue writs of ''Habeas Corpus'' on behalf of draftees, and declared that State courts had [[concurrent jurisdiction]] with the Confederate courts in such cases. Yet, the Secretary of War refused to accept the courts decisions.<ref>Rable 1994, pp. 199-200, 262.</ref>\n\nFarmers in the North Carolina [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] saw their lives severely disrupted by the draft. Three years in the army meant severe hardships for their families as well as a risk of losing the improvements they had made on their farms. At public meetings they expressed their opposition to the several conscription acts. Once forced into the army, many did not stay; [[desertion]] became rampant. Having returned to their homes, they created secret self-defense groups in order to stay out of the army. Local [[home guard]]s were tasked with apprehending deserters, but community resistance made their missions difficult and at the end of the war 12,000 North Carolinians had run away from the Confederate army (about ten percent of the total serving force from the state). In the poor mountain area of the state, armed resistance group displayed their strength. While the draft resisting farmers of the Piedmont still identified with the Southern cause, although balking at the extreme actions of the Confederate government, the mountain people rejected the whole concept of being governed by what they perceived as a slave-owning [[oligarchy]].

The show was a humorous presentation on the importance of the human brain.\n\nThe show's script was written by Jenny Tripp, a staff writer in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Feature Animation]], and directed by [[Jerry Rees]], who in addition to many other Disney film-based attractions, directed ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]''. The pre-show itself was the first directing effort of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], famous for later directing ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n\nIt premiered on October 19, 1989; as of January 4, 2004 it began to operate seasonally, closing permanently on January 1, 2007. During the 2007 International Food & Wine Festival, the entrance was used as a wine presentation. The pavilion has continued to be used for various Epcot festival events.{{facts|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Preshow==\n[[File:Cranium Command (358808645).jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee featuring Buzzy (top) and General Knowledge (bottom).]] From the entrance at the back of the pavilion, guests walked into a very basic, sparsely themed holding room with a digital counter reading the time until the next show. On the walls hung propaganda posters encouraging guests to enlist in the \"Cranium Command\" (similar signage could be seen advertising the show around the Wonders of Life pavilion). Also there was signage including brain teasers and humorous gags and puns, setting the stage for both the concept and tone. Guests were then led into a narrow, tall room with brightly colored carpeted walls. Facing the guests was a plain movie screen, and closed automatic doors to their left.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\">{{cite web|title=Cranium Command|url=http://www.yesterland.com/cranium.html|website=Yesterland}}</ref>\n\nThe movie screen would soon illuminate showing an animated segment featuring the boisterous and loud General Knowledge ([[voice actor|voiced]] by [[Corey Burton]])<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[The Walt Disney World Explorer]]|developer=Mindsai Productions|developer2=[[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney Interactive]]|publisher=Disney Interactive|date=1996|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS|Apple Macintosh]]|version=1.0|scene=Cranium Command - Trivia slideshow|level= |language= |quote='''General Knowledge''': \"The voice of General Knowledge ''(begins to change to Burton's natural voice)'' was played by Corey Burton.\" / '''Burton''': \"''(chuckles)'' That's me.\"}}</ref> briefing his \"Cranium Commando\" troops on their mission: to pilot human brains and keep the people they're in out of trouble. A bumbling little soldier named Buzzy (Scott Curtis) had been given one of the most difficult missions of all: piloting a twelve-year-old boy.\n\nWhen General Knowledge spoke in the pre-show and was explaining that they were different kinds of brains, he showed a picture of [[Albert Einstein]], as the example of a person who used his brain and [[Ernest P. Worrell]] (a popular fictional character played by [[Jim Varney]], who was appearing in series of feature films produced by Disney at the time), as an example of the opposite. At the end of the preshow, General Knowledge asked the guests, \"''Hey, you Goldbricks! This ain't no Spectator Sport! Where do you think you are, Disney World?!'' Get your strollers in line and hustle!\", pointing towards the theater as the automatic doors swung open.\n\n==Show==\nThe main show was presented in a 200-seat, dimly-lit theater designed to represent the inside of a human head; the outside world seen on video displays where the eyes would be. Buzzy was now presented as an [[Audio-Animatronic]] on an articulated seat so that he could move around during the performance. Helping him pilot the twelve-year-old named Bobby (also acted by Scott Curtis), via appearances on other video screens, were the logical Left Brain ([[Charles Grodin]]), the wacky Right Brain ([[Jon Lovitz]]), the hungry Stomach ([[George Wendt]]), the panicky Bladder who is also referred to as \"Elimination\" ([[Jeff Doucette]], in an uncredited role), the Adrenal Gland ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]) who was prone to overreacting, and the heart's Right and Left Ventricles ([[Dana Carvey]] and [[Kevin Nealon]], reprising their [[Hans and Franz]] roles from [[Saturday Night Live]]). The monotone Hypothalamus (voiced by [[Kirk Wise]]), which regulated autonomic bodily functions, was represented via Audio-Animatronics as a robot.\n\nThe show took Buzzy's host through a typical day: getting up, skipping breakfast, running to school after missing the bus, meeting and falling for a cute new girl (Annie, played by [[Natalie Gregory]]), protecting her from bullies, getting involved in a [[food fight]] at lunch, getting sent to the principal (Kenneth Kimmins), and being thanked by the girl, then kissed after asking her out. At each point in the day, the various organs of the body talked to Buzzy, explained the problems they were facing, and in many cases argued over how Buzzy should deal with the situation. In the end, Buzzy (via help of General Knowledge's advice) eventually learned how to effectively balance the needs of his body crew in order to combat potential stressful situations.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/>\n\n==Orgins==\nThe attraction was the only fully surviving element from the original 1978 plans for EPCOT Center's \"Life and Health\" pavilion. Titled \"The Head Trip\", it was to share a theatre space with a dentistry-themed show called \"Tooth Follies\". Designed by legendary Imagineer [[Rolly Crump]], the stage and concept would be similar to the final incarnation, but with three animatronics dedicated to [[emotion]], [[intellect]] and [[the nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Oh My Disney|title=The Wonders of the Wonders of Life|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/07/31/the-wonders-of-the-wonders-of-life/|date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> When Disney was unable to find a sponsor to host the pavilion, the construction of Life and Health was delayed indefinitely. However, an expansion pad between the [[Universe of Energy]] pavilion and the [[Horizons (Epcot)|Horizons]] pavilion was kept as Disney still planned to build it.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, then Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] finally secured [[MetLife]] to sponsor the Life and Health pavilion, now renamed \"[[Wonders of Life]]\" and restarted development. Imagineer Steve Kirk replaced Crump on the project, and worked with Barry Braveman to flesh out the idea of \"The Head Trip\" into its own full attraction. Partially inspired by the 1943 [[Walt Disney]]-produced animated propaganda film [[Reason and Emotion]], they explored the idea of transforming the concept into a parody of the [[Star Trek]] franchise. The human head was to be represented as a bridge on a spaceship much like the [[Starship Enterprise]]. Kirk explains: \"...there was one character with a supporting cast on film for different parts of the body. Originally there was a captain, a [[Mr. Spock]] type, several ensigns at each of the senses, there was an officer for reason, there was an officer for emotion... so there was a little cast of these little characters about, maybe, 2 feet tall in this pretty big theatre that was a pretty involved bridge of a ship, which was, again, inside the human head.\" Eventually, the budget was reduced to only be able to include one audio-animatronic figure and a robot, eventually becoming the Hypothalamus. Kirk hoped that the show would have been reprogrammed over the years to include different versions of the show in order to discuss a variety of health-related topics, but that idea never came to be.<ref name=\"Steve Kirk\">WDW Radio interview with Steve Kirk http://www.wdwradio.com/2008/02/interview-with-former-disney-imagineer-steve-kirk/</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWith the budget reduction also came a new take on the concept along with its final name. Now titled \"Cranium Command\", the show featured a military theme wherein \"brain pilots\" take control of a mechanized human head. The main audio-animatronic character was dubbed \"Captain Cortex\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|title=Ride Through the Human Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=cranium+command+captain+cortex&source=bl&ots=ndKiBE7aC2&sig=Ga3ewuo3N1TaW78Dy-5kkABfEMc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI3dG-wq_MAhVMRiYKHR_ZBxIQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> and ran the body, now that of a young boy, much like one would a military craft. He reports under his commanding officer \"General Knowledge\", who lectured the audience during the pre-show and then to Cortex in the main show. With time and resources running low, Imagineering outsourced production of the animated and live-action film portions to [[Colossal Pictures]], who had previously worked with them on the 3D show \"[[Magic Journeys]]\". However, halfway into production Disney executives killed this version of the project to have it retooled by their own Feature Animation department. Animator Steve Moore, who worked on both versions, recalled, \"They were doing more of a Fred Crippen, Roger Ramjet style, which was fun, but not winning points with the clients. Storytelling was Colossal's Achilles heel ...they took the story given to them by Imagineering and followed it, thinking they were giving their client what they wanted.  Unfortunately, it was written like an educational film from the '40s - very dry and condescending.  No amount of style could make up for the lack of substance.  And even though Colossal was executing Imagineering's story,  their inability to interpret the story into something workable sunk them.\"<ref name=\"Steve Moore\">{{cite web |url= http://flipanimation.blogspot.com/2013/08/remembering-epcots-cranium-command-both.html|title= Remembering EPCOT's Cranium Command - Both Versions|last= Moore|first= Steve|date= August 28, 2013|website= Flip Animation blog|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1989, director Jerry Rees was approached by [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], (at the time) president of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], to speak with several Disney brass members including Eisner, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Marty Sklar]] and Tom Fitzgerald. They all unanimously loathed Colossal Pictures' take on \"Cranium Command\" and sought him out to fix it. After a brief review, Rees cited the various issues and recommended that the project be rewritten from scratch. The executives gave Rees full creative freedom aside from needing to keep General Knowledge and the overall stress-management theme, per the sponsor's request. Unfortunately they only had five months to complete the project, as they had to reach the October deadline.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\">{{cite web |url= http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-making-of-cranium-command.html|title= The Making of Cranium Command|last= |first= |date= |website= The Disney Project|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> \n\n===Animation===\nRees rounded up as many animators from Feature Animation as he could, including [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Tom Sito]]. The latter three along with Rees crafted an entirely new storyline in under a week with Jenny Tripp penning the script. One of the largest changes was the personality of General Knowledge, now based on [[R. Lee Ermey]]'s character from ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''. Per Wise, \"We thought it would be funny if the character who was supposed to teach you how to manage your stress screamed at you incessantly like a psychotic drill sergeant.\" They also changed the pilot's name from Captain Cortex to Buzzy, a bumbling young recruit. [[Rob Minkoff]] was slated to direct the animated preshow as Rees needed to focus on the live-action heavy main show, but dropped out to take over the [[Roger Rabbit]] short \"[[Roller Coaster Rabbit]]\". Schneider desperately asked the unproven Trousdale and Wise duo to step in as directors. Wise claims, \"Saying \"yes\" turned out to be the smartest thing Gary and I ever did.\" In addition, the pre-show of \"Cranium Command\" was the very last project at Disney Feature Animation to be traditionally inked and painted on cels.<ref name=\"Steve Moore\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nWhile work on the animation commenced at the newly built animation wing at [[Disney-MGM Studios]], Rees flew to Los Angeles to begin filming the live-action main show elements. Eventually he would end up directing nearly all of the show elements, per him: \u201cEverything that you see and hear from the 8 screens, 2 Audio-Animatronic figures, and the 10 discreet channels of sound.\" The complexity of creating the seemingly uncut [[point-of-view shot]]s which had to interact with several other pieces of media was a \"wild\" task for the ambitious director. Without optical or digital assistance, he used camera tricks and matching blur frames to stitch together the POV footage to seem like one continuous shot. In addition, Rees took the cinematographer and camera operators to the filming locations prior to shooting. When there, they would do tests to figure out how to make the camera express behavior and emotion such as shyness, love, anger, fear, panic and worry. This was essential to the intended immersion that you were inside a boy's head, looking out his eyes as he experienced life and reacted to it.\n\nAfter the POV filming was complete, Rees took to a soundstage to film the live-action scenes involving the \"body crew\". Wanting to turn audience members' expectations on their ears,{{clarify|date=April 2016}} he cast various famous comedians of the time to play the roles in zany sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The project's complexities continued to dominate, as Rees had to put one eye on the filming and one eye on a monitor playing the POV video in order to cue up the footage accordingly. Finally, he reached post-production by first mocking the eight screens of the theatre in Los Angeles and editing all the various film items together along with the animatronic dialogue, which bewildered executives such as Katzenberg when reviewing the production.\n\n===Programming the Animatronics===\nOnce editing was complete, Rees came back to Orlando and spent the remaining time with Imagineering in the finished theatre putting all the pieces together. While Rees himself articulated the audio-animatronic of Buzzy, animator Rebecca Rees (Jerry's wife) took control of the live-animation of the droning Hypothalamus robot, as she was the one who came up with the idea behind the character. In an uncredited role, Kirk Wise voiced the Hypothalamus.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\"/> For the animation of the Buzzy animatronic, Rees used the concept of the articulated arm the character sits on to create the illusion of centrifugal force. For example, when the boy's head turned right (simulated through the POV eye footage), Buzzy's platform and chair would swing to the left. This was yet another device to immerse the audience into the experience to feel like they were riding inside a human head even though the bench seating in the theatre did not move.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\">The Disney Project podcast episode 8 \"Welcome to Jerry Rees Month\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-disney-project-podcast-episode-8.html</ref>\n===Music===\nComposer David Newman, who had previously worked with Rees on \"[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]\" and \"Back to Neverland\" (a short about animation at [[Disney-MGM Studios]] starring [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Robin Williams]]) wrote the show's music score. The pre-show's score evokes the tone of military marching music, but becomes more orchestral in the main show. Unlike most music created for theme park attractions, there are multiple [[leitmotifs]] more in common with a fuller film score. In an interview, Newman briefly cited that it was a lot of fun, much like his other projects with Rees.<ref name=\"Tammy Tucker\">The Tiara Talk Show: Interview with David Newman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDqnqA2Wsc</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:Wonders of Life Cranium Command Entrance.jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee formerly stood behind where a seminar stage stands now.]]''Cranium Command'''s opening was largely overshadowed by its sister attraction in Wonders of Life, the flight simulator thrill ride [[Body Wars]]. (Epcot's first) It also happened to have a poor location, tucked away in the back obscured by many other exhibits. Still, the attraction was regarded then and for almost the entire pavilion's lifespan as its \"hidden gem\" for its wit, charm, self-aware humor and fast-paced nature. The \"Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World\" book series even termed the attraction as \"Epcot's hidden gem\", stating \"Epcot and Walt Disney World could use a lot more of this type of humor.\"<ref name=\"Bob Sehlinger\">Touring Plans -- Cranium Command Unofficial Guide historical reference entry https://touringplans.com/epcot/attractions/cranium-command#</ref> It remains beloved by many Disney fans a decade after its closure.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/> Jerry Rees even stated that out of the record-setting 13 theme park attractions he helmed for Disney, Cranium Command was at the top of the list of the ones he most loved working on, so much so that for years afterward he unsuccessfully tried to get a feature film made shot entirely from a man's point-of-view.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\"/>\n\nA \"Cranium Command\" trading pin featuring Buzzy was released in 2012 in tribute of Epcot's 30th anniversary<ref>{{cite web |url=http://remainseatedplease.com/2015/throwback-thursday-cranium-command-at-epcot/ |title= Throwback Thursday - Cranium Command at EPCOT!|author=David|date= March 12, 2015|website= Remain Seated Please|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> and a Vinylmation twin pack featuring Buzzy and General Knowledge was released in 2014.<ref name=>{{cite web |url=http://vinylmationkingdom.com/2014/07/22/vinylmation-park-series-14-twin-pack-cranium-command-details/ |title=Vinylmation Park Series 14 Twin Pack Cranium Command Details |author=rogpalmeruk |date= July 22, 2014|website= VinylMation Kingdom|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}} </ref>\n\nThe attraction never changed over the course of its 17-year lifespan, aside from the entrance marquee. Upon opening, the entrance advertised the famous live-action comedians featured in the show but did not stick out much. In the mid-90s, it was remodeled to a much more theatrical appearance, focusing more on the militaristic and animated portions of the show, proudly featuring General Knowledge and Buzzy.<ref name=\"Unknown admin\">Lost Epcot \"Cranium Command\" photos http://www.lostepcot.com/craniumcommand.html</ref>\n\nThe show has a number of ties to important Disney history as well. At the grand opening, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] was so impressed by the pre-show that he claimed it was almost more entertaining than the main show itself. When he got back to Glendale, he found himself needing to assign a new director to ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' after firing Richard Purdum from the project due to creative differences. Immediately he thought of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], who were major players on turning the troubled ''Cranium Command'' project around in record time, and giving it a great sense of humor which ''Beast'' desperately needed at the moment. Katzenberg quickly hired the duo who in turn ended up making ''Beauty and the Beast'' one of the most critically acclaimed animated films of all-time, and one of Disney's largest hits.<ref name=\"Jim Hill\">Looking Back on \"Beauty and the Beast\" -- Part II http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2004/06/09/188.aspx</ref>\n\nAnother connection was that [[Pete Docter]] wound up as an animator on the project (one of his first jobs), who would later become a director at [[Pixar]]. Coincidentally, Docter's third feature ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' had a very similar premise (exploring the mind of an 11-year-old girl) and he admitted the attraction played a part inspiring its development.<ref>{{cite web|website=Oh My Disney|author=Drew Taylor|title=Go Inside Pete Docter's Mind|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/06/16/go-inside-pete-docters-mind-5-disney-classics-that-inspired-inside-out/|date=June 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Disney short ''Inner Workings'', which debuted with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' also shares similar themes. Directed by Leo Matsuda, the short \"is the story of the internal struggle between a man\u2019s Brain\u2014a pragmatic protector who calculates his every move, and his Heart\u2014a free-spirited adventurer who wants to let loose.\" ''Cranium Command'', along with the [[World War II]] propaganda short ''[[Reason and Emotion]]'' is cited as one of the main inspirations for the short.<ref>{{cite web|website=/Film|title=Disney\u2019s Next Short Film \u2018Inner Workings\u2019 to Debut at Annecy; Will Play With \u2018Moana\u2019|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/disney-inner-workings-short/|author=Angie Han|date=April 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Status after ride closure==\nAfter shutting down in 2007, the attraction was left intact but closed to public access. In 2017, Matt Sonswa, an urban explorer, posted an exploration video on YouTube of the show building showing the pre-show, theater, and animatronics to be in good condition.

The show was a humorous presentation on the importance of the human brain.\n\nThe show's script was written by Jenny Tripp, a staff writer in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Feature Animation]], and directed by [[Jerry Rees]], who in addition to many other Disney film-based attractions, directed ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]''. The pre-show itself was the first directing effort of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], famous for later directing ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n\nIt premiered on October 19, 1989; as of January 4, 2004 it began to operate seasonally, closing permanently on January 1, 2007. During the 2007 International Food & Wine Festival, the entrance was used as a wine presentation. The pavilion has continued to be used for various Epcot festival events.{{facts|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Preshow==\n[[File:Cranium Command (358808645).jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee featuring Buzzy (top) and General Knowledge (bottom).]] From the entrance at the back of the pavilion, guests walked into a very basic, sparsely themed holding room with a digital counter reading the time until the next show. On the walls hung propaganda posters encouraging guests to enlist in the \"Cranium Command\" (similar signage could be seen advertising the show around the Wonders of Life pavilion). Also there was signage including brain teasers and humorous gags and puns, setting the stage for both the concept and tone. Guests were then led into a narrow, tall room with brightly colored carpeted walls. Facing the guests was a plain movie screen, and closed automatic doors to their left.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\">{{cite web|title=Cranium Command|url=http://www.yesterland.com/cranium.html|website=Yesterland}}</ref>\n\nThe movie screen would soon illuminate showing an animated segment featuring the boisterous and loud General Knowledge ([[voice actor|voiced]] by [[Corey Burton]])<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[The Walt Disney World Explorer]]|developer=Mindsai Productions|developer2=[[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney Interactive]]|publisher=Disney Interactive|date=1996|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS|Apple Macintosh]]|version=1.0|scene=Cranium Command - Trivia slideshow|level= |language= |quote='''General Knowledge''': \"The voice of General Knowledge ''(begins to change to Burton's natural voice)'' was played by Corey Burton.\" / '''Burton''': \"''(chuckles)'' That's me.\"}}</ref> briefing his \"Cranium Commando\" troops on their mission: to pilot human brains and keep the people they're in out of trouble. A bumbling little soldier named Buzzy (Scott Curtis) had been given one of the most difficult missions of all: piloting a twelve-year-old boy.\n\nWhen General Knowledge spoke in the pre-show and was explaining that they were different kinds of brains, he showed a picture of [[Albert Einstein]], as the example of a person who used his brain and [[Ernest P. Worrell]] (a popular fictional character played by [[Jim Varney]], who was appearing in series of feature films produced by Disney at the time), as an example of the opposite. At the end of the preshow, General Knowledge asked the guests, \"''Hey, you Goldbricks! This ain't no Spectator Sport! Where do you think you are, Disney World?!'' Get your strollers in line and hustle!\", pointing towards the theater as the automatic doors swung open.\n\n==Show==\nThe main show was presented in a 200-seat, dimly-lit theater designed to represent the inside of a human head; the outside world seen on video displays where the eyes would be. Buzzy was now presented as an [[Audio-Animatronic]] on an articulated seat so that he could move around during the performance. Helping him pilot the twelve-year-old named Bobby (also acted by Scott Curtis), via appearances on other video screens, were the logical Left Brain ([[Charles Grodin]]), the wacky Right Brain ([[Jon Lovitz]]), the hungry Stomach ([[George Wendt]]), the panicky Bladder who is also referred to as \"Elimination\" ([[Jeff Doucette]], in an uncredited role), the Adrenal Gland ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]) who was prone to overreacting, and the heart's Right and Left Ventricles ([[Dana Carvey]] and [[Kevin Nealon]], reprising their [[Hans and Franz]] roles from [[Saturday Night Live]]). The monotone Hypothalamus (voiced by [[Kirk Wise]]), which regulated autonomic bodily functions, was represented via Audio-Animatronics as a robot.\n\nThe show took Buzzy's host through a typical day: getting up, skipping breakfast, running to school after missing the bus, meeting and falling for a cute new girl (Annie, played by [[Natalie Gregory]]), protecting her from bullies, getting involved in a [[food fight]] at lunch, getting sent to the principal (Kenneth Kimmins), and being thanked by the girl, then kissed after asking her out. At each point in the day, the various organs of the body talked to Buzzy, explained the problems they were facing, and in many cases argued over how Buzzy should deal with the situation. In the end, Buzzy (via help of General Knowledge's advice) eventually learned how to effectively balance the needs of his body crew in order to combat potential stressful situations.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/>\n\n==Orgins==\nThe attraction was the only fully surviving element from the original 1978 plans for EPCOT Center's \"Life and Health\" pavilion. Titled \"The Head Trip\", it was to share a theatre space with a dentistry-themed show called \"Tooth Follies\". Designed by legendary Imagineer [[Rolly Crump]], the stage and concept would be similar to the final incarnation, but with three animatronics dedicated to [[emotion]], [[intellect]] and [[the nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Oh My Disney|title=The Wonders of the Wonders of Life|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/07/31/the-wonders-of-the-wonders-of-life/|date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> When Disney was unable to find a sponsor to host the pavilion, the construction of Life and Health was delayed indefinitely. However, an expansion pad between the [[Universe of Energy]] pavilion and the [[Horizons (Epcot)|Horizons]] pavilion was kept as Disney still planned to build it.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, then Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] finally secured [[MetLife]] to sponsor the Life and Health pavilion, now renamed \"[[Wonders of Life]]\" and restarted development. Imagineer Steve Kirk replaced Crump on the project, and worked with Barry Braveman to flesh out the idea of \"The Head Trip\" into its own full attraction. Partially inspired by the 1943 [[Walt Disney]]-produced animated propaganda film [[Reason and Emotion]], they explored the idea of transforming the concept into a parody of the [[Star Trek]] franchise. The human head was to be represented as a bridge on a spaceship much like the [[Starship Enterprise]]. Kirk explains: \"...there was one character with a supporting cast on film for different parts of the body. Originally there was a captain, a [[Mr. Spock]] type, several ensigns at each of the senses, there was an officer for reason, there was an officer for emotion... so there was a little cast of these little characters about, maybe, 2 feet tall in this pretty big theatre that was a pretty involved bridge of a ship, which was, again, inside the human head.\" Eventually, the budget was reduced to only be able to include one audio-animatronic figure and a robot, eventually becoming the Hypothalamus. Kirk hoped that the show would have been reprogrammed over the years to include different versions of the show in order to discuss a variety of health-related topics, but that idea never came to be.<ref name=\"Steve Kirk\">WDW Radio interview with Steve Kirk http://www.wdwradio.com/2008/02/interview-with-former-disney-imagineer-steve-kirk/</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWith the budget reduction also came a new take on the concept along with its final name. Now titled \"Cranium Command\", the show featured a military theme wherein \"brain pilots\" take control of a mechanized human head. The main audio-animatronic character was dubbed \"Captain Cortex\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|title=Ride Through the Human Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=cranium+command+captain+cortex&source=bl&ots=ndKiBE7aC2&sig=Ga3ewuo3N1TaW78Dy-5kkABfEMc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI3dG-wq_MAhVMRiYKHR_ZBxIQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> and ran the body, now that of a young boy, much like one would a military craft. He reports under his commanding officer \"General Knowledge\", who lectured the audience during the pre-show and then to Cortex in the main show. With time and resources running low, Imagineering outsourced production of the animated and live-action film portions to [[Colossal Pictures]], who had previously worked with them on the 3D show \"[[Magic Journeys]]\". However, halfway into production Disney executives killed this version of the project to have it retooled by their own Feature Animation department. Animator Steve Moore, who worked on both versions, recalled, \"They were doing more of a Fred Crippen, Roger Ramjet style, which was fun, but not winning points with the clients. Storytelling was Colossal's Achilles heel ...they took the story given to them by Imagineering and followed it, thinking they were giving their client what they wanted.  Unfortunately, it was written like an educational film from the '40s - very dry and condescending.  No amount of style could make up for the lack of substance.  And even though Colossal was executing Imagineering's story,  their inability to interpret the story into something workable sunk them.\"<ref name=\"Steve Moore\">{{cite web |url= http://flipanimation.blogspot.com/2013/08/remembering-epcots-cranium-command-both.html|title= Remembering EPCOT's Cranium Command - Both Versions|last= Moore|first= Steve|date= August 28, 2013|website= Flip Animation blog|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1989, director Jerry Rees was approached by [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], (at the time) president of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], to speak with several Disney brass members including Eisner, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Marty Sklar]] and Tom Fitzgerald. They all unanimously loathed Colossal Pictures' take on \"Cranium Command\" and sought him out to fix it. After a brief review, Rees cited the various issues and recommended that the project be rewritten from scratch. The executives gave Rees full creative freedom aside from needing to keep General Knowledge and the overall stress-management theme, per the sponsor's request. Unfortunately they only had five months to complete the project, as they had to reach the October deadline.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\">{{cite web |url= http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-making-of-cranium-command.html|title= The Making of Cranium Command|last= |first= |date= |website= The Disney Project|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> \n\n===Animation===\nRees rounded up as many animators from Feature Animation as he could, including [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Tom Sito]]. The latter three along with Rees crafted an entirely new storyline in under a week with Jenny Tripp penning the script. One of the largest changes was the personality of General Knowledge, now based on [[R. Lee Ermey]]'s character from ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''. Per Wise, \"We thought it would be funny if the character who was supposed to teach you how to manage your stress screamed at you incessantly like a psychotic drill sergeant.\" They also changed the pilot's name from Captain Cortex to Buzzy, a bumbling young recruit. [[Rob Minkoff]] was slated to direct the animated preshow as Rees needed to focus on the live-action heavy main show, but dropped out to take over the [[Roger Rabbit]] short \"[[Roller Coaster Rabbit]]\". Schneider desperately asked the unproven Trousdale and Wise duo to step in as directors. Wise claims, \"Saying \"yes\" turned out to be the smartest thing Gary and I ever did.\" In addition, the pre-show of \"Cranium Command\" was the very last project at Disney Feature Animation to be traditionally inked and painted on cels.<ref name=\"Steve Moore\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nWhile work on the animation commenced at the newly built animation wing at [[Disney-MGM Studios]], Rees flew to Los Angeles to begin filming the live-action main show elements. Eventually he would end up directing nearly all of the show elements, per him: \u201cEverything that you see and hear from the 8 screens, 2 Audio-Animatronic figures, and the 10 discreet channels of sound.\" The complexity of creating the seemingly uncut [[point-of-view shot]]s which had to interact with several other pieces of media was a \"wild\" task for the ambitious director. Without optical or digital assistance, he used camera tricks and matching blur frames to stitch together the POV footage to seem like one continuous shot. In addition, Rees took the cinematographer and camera operators to the filming locations prior to shooting. When there, they would do tests to figure out how to make the camera express behavior and emotion such as shyness, love, anger, fear, panic and worry. This was essential to the intended immersion that you were inside a boy's head, looking out his eyes as he experienced life and reacted to it.\n\nAfter the POV filming was complete, Rees took to a soundstage to film the live-action scenes involving the \"body crew\". Wanting to turn audience members' expectations on their ears,{{clarify|date=April 2016}} he cast various famous comedians of the time to play the roles in zany sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The project's complexities continued to dominate, as Rees had to put one eye on the filming and one eye on a monitor playing the POV video in order to cue up the footage accordingly. Finally, he reached post-production by first mocking the eight screens of the theatre in Los Angeles and editing all the various film items together along with the animatronic dialogue, which bewildered executives such as Katzenberg when reviewing the production.\n\n===Programming the Animatronics===\nOnce editing was complete, Rees came back to Orlando and spent the remaining time with Imagineering in the finished theatre putting all the pieces together. While Rees himself articulated the audio-animatronic of Buzzy, animator Rebecca Rees (Jerry's wife) took control of the live-animation of the droning Hypothalamus robot, as she was the one who came up with the idea behind the character. In an uncredited role, Kirk Wise voiced the Hypothalamus.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\"/> For the animation of the Buzzy animatronic, Rees used the concept of the articulated arm the character sits on to create the illusion of centrifugal force. For example, when the boy's head turned right (simulated through the POV eye footage), Buzzy's platform and chair would swing to the left. This was yet another device to immerse the audience into the experience to feel like they were riding inside a human head even though the bench seating in the theatre did not move.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\">The Disney Project podcast episode 8 \"Welcome to Jerry Rees Month\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-disney-project-podcast-episode-8.html</ref>\n===Music===\nComposer David Newman, who had previously worked with Rees on \"[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]\" and \"Back to Neverland\" (a short about animation at [[Disney-MGM Studios]] starring [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Robin Williams]]) wrote the show's music score. The pre-show's score evokes the tone of military marching music, but becomes more orchestral in the main show. Unlike most music created for theme park attractions, there are multiple [[leitmotifs]] more in common with a fuller film score. In an interview, Newman briefly cited that it was a lot of fun, much like his other projects with Rees.<ref name=\"Tammy Tucker\">The Tiara Talk Show: Interview with David Newman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDqnqA2Wsc</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:Wonders of Life Cranium Command Entrance.jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee formerly stood behind where a seminar stage stands now.]]''Cranium Command'''s opening was largely overshadowed by its sister attraction in Wonders of Life, the flight simulator thrill ride [[Body Wars]]. (Epcot's first) It also happened to have a poor location, tucked away in the back obscured by many other exhibits. Still, the attraction was regarded then and for almost the entire pavilion's lifespan as its \"hidden gem\" for its wit, charm, self-aware humor and fast-paced nature. The \"Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World\" book series even termed the attraction as \"Epcot's hidden gem\", stating \"Epcot and Walt Disney World could use a lot more of this type of humor.\"<ref name=\"Bob Sehlinger\">Touring Plans -- Cranium Command Unofficial Guide historical reference entry https://touringplans.com/epcot/attractions/cranium-command#</ref> It remains beloved by many Disney fans a decade after its closure.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/> Jerry Rees even stated that out of the record-setting 13 theme park attractions he helmed for Disney, Cranium Command was at the top of the list of the ones he most loved working on, so much so that for years afterward he unsuccessfully tried to get a feature film made shot entirely from a man's point-of-view.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\"/>\n\nA \"Cranium Command\" trading pin featuring Buzzy was released in 2012 in tribute of Epcot's 30th anniversary<ref>{{cite web |url=http://remainseatedplease.com/2015/throwback-thursday-cranium-command-at-epcot/ |title= Throwback Thursday - Cranium Command at EPCOT!|author=David|date= March 12, 2015|website= Remain Seated Please|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> and a Vinylmation twin pack featuring Buzzy and General Knowledge was released in 2014.<ref name=>{{cite web |url=http://vinylmationkingdom.com/2014/07/22/vinylmation-park-series-14-twin-pack-cranium-command-details/ |title=Vinylmation Park Series 14 Twin Pack Cranium Command Details |author=rogpalmeruk |date= July 22, 2014|website= VinylMation Kingdom|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}} </ref>\n\nThe attraction never changed over the course of its 17-year lifespan, aside from the entrance marquee. Upon opening, the entrance advertised the famous live-action comedians featured in the show but did not stick out much. In the mid-90s, it was remodeled to a much more theatrical appearance, focusing more on the militaristic and animated portions of the show, proudly featuring General Knowledge and Buzzy.<ref name=\"Unknown admin\">Lost Epcot \"Cranium Command\" photos http://www.lostepcot.com/craniumcommand.html</ref>\n\nThe show has a number of ties to important Disney history as well. At the grand opening, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] was so impressed by the pre-show that he claimed it was almost more entertaining than the main show itself. When he got back to Glendale, he found himself needing to assign a new director to ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' after firing Richard Purdum from the project due to creative differences. Immediately he thought of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], who were major players on turning the troubled ''Cranium Command'' project around in record time, and giving it a great sense of humor which ''Beast'' desperately needed at the moment. Katzenberg quickly hired the duo who in turn ended up making ''Beauty and the Beast'' one of the most critically acclaimed animated films of all-time, and one of Disney's largest hits.<ref name=\"Jim Hill\">Looking Back on \"Beauty and the Beast\" -- Part II http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2004/06/09/188.aspx</ref>\n\nAnother connection was that [[Pete Docter]] wound up as an animator on the project (one of his first jobs), who would later become a director at [[Pixar]]. Coincidentally, Docter's third feature ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' had a very similar premise (exploring the mind of an 11-year-old girl) and he admitted the attraction played a part inspiring its development.<ref name=\"Drew Taylor\">Oh My Disney \"Go Inside Pete Docter's Mind\" article https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/06/16/go-inside-pete-docters-mind-5-disney-classics-that-inspired-inside-out/</ref>\n\nThe Disney short ''Inner Workings'', which debuted with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' also shares similar themes. Directed by Leo Matsuda, the short \"is the story of the internal struggle between a man\u2019s Brain\u2014a pragmatic protector who calculates his every move, and his Heart\u2014a free-spirited adventurer who wants to let loose.\" ''Cranium Command'', along with the [[World War II]] propaganda short ''[[Reason and Emotion]]'' is cited as one of the main inspirations for the short.<ref name=\"Angie Han\">/Film article \"Disney\u2019s Next Short Film \u2018Inner Workings\u2019 to Debut at Annecy; Will Play With \u2018Moana\u2019\" http://www.slashfilm.com/disney-inner-workings-short/</ref>\n\n==Status after ride closure==\nAfter shutting down in 2007, the attraction was left intact but closed to public access. In 2017, Matt Sonswa, an urban explorer, posted an exploration video on YouTube of the show building showing the pre-show, theater, and animatronics to be in good condition. A number of animatronic elements including Buzzy were marked by the Walt Disney archives for preservation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sonswa |first1=Matt |title=Disney Cranium Command Epcot |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrOPmotqGCY&t |website=YouTube |publisher=MattSonswa |accessdate= 3 February 2019}}</ref> Cranium Command subsequently became an increasingly popular destination for urban explorers.\n\nOn February 21, 2019, Disney announced that the Wonders of Life pavilion, including the Cranium Command show building, will be repurposed as a new pavilion entitled [[Play!]].
