He indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can \"do it without thinking\". This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film, even years later.<ref>\"Anthony Hopkins: Lecter and Me\"&nbsp;\u2014 ''Red Dragon'' DVD interview</ref>\n\n[[Richard Attenborough]], who directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and [[Debra Winger]]), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for \"this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift.\"<ref name=\"falk\" />\n\nRenowned for his ability to remember lines, Hopkins keeps his memory supple by learning things by heart such as poetry and Shakespeare.

He had come back to Britain after living for a number of years in Hollywood, having all but given up on a career there, saying, \"Well that part of my life's over; it's a chapter closed. I suppose I'll just have to settle for being a respectable actor poncing around the West End and doing respectable BBC work for the rest of my life.\"<ref name=\"falk\" /> Hopkins played the iconic villain in adaptations of the first three of the Lecter novels by [[Thomas Harris]]. The author was reportedly very pleased with Hopkins' portrayal of his antagonist. However, Hopkins stated that ''[[Red Dragon (2002 film)|Red Dragon]]'' would feature his final performance as the character, and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series, ''[[Hannibal Rising (film)|Hannibal Rising]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Anthony Hopkins regrets playing Hannibal Lecter thrice.

He indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can \"do it without thinking\". This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film, even years later.<ref>\"Anthony Hopkins: Lecter and Me\"&nbsp;\u2014 ''Red Dragon'' DVD interview</ref>\n\n[[Richard Attenborough]], who directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and [[Debra Winger]]), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for \"this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift.\"<ref name=\"falk\" />\n\nRenowned for his ability to remember lines, Hopkins keeps his memory supple by learning things by heart such as poetry and Shakespeare. In Steven Spielberg's ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', Hopkins astounded the crew with his memorisation of a seven-page courtroom speech, delivering it in one go. An overawed Spielberg couldn't bring himself to call him Tony, and insisted on addressing him as Sir Anthony throughout the shoot.<ref name=\"RADA\">[https://www.theguardian.com/film/1998/dec/05/features A dark and stormy knight] ''[[The Guardian]]''.

When I was a kid I'd tell the girls around the street the story about [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] and I'd go 'th-th-th' (the sucking noise which he reproduced in ''The Silence of the Lambs''). As a result, they'd run away screaming.\"<ref name=\"RT Interview\">[https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/film-news/sir-anthony-hopkins-reveals-scary-12079267 \"Anthony Hopkins reveals his scary Hannibal Lecter was born on the streets of Port Talbot when he was a boy\"].

His interview on the 1998 relaunch edition of the British TV talk show ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' featured an impersonation of comedian [[Tommy Cooper]].

In the same year, as part of the restoration process for the [[Stanley Kubrick]] film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', Hopkins was approached to re-record lines from a scene that was being added back to the film; this scene featured [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Tony Curtis]], with Hopkins recommended by Olivier's widow, [[Joan Plowright]] to perform her late husband's part thanks to his talent for mimicry.<ref name=\"Universal Pictures\">{{cite web|title=Restoration of \"Spartacus\" \u2013 \"Spartacus\" Production Notes|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2009/spartacus/|publisher=Universal Pictures|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, he directed ''[[August (1996 film)|August]]'', an adaptation of [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' set in Wales.

He introduced [[romanticism]] into [[Danish literature]].\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]], then a suburb of [[Copenhagen]], on 14 November 1779. His father, a [[Schleswig]]er by birth, was at that time [[organist]], and later became keeper, of the royal palace of [[Frederiksberg]]; he was a very brisk and cheerful man. The poet's mother, on the other hand, who was partly German by extraction, suffered from [[depression (mood)|depression]], which afterwards deepened into [[melancholia|melancholy]] madness.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|last=Gosse |first=Edmund |authorlink=Edmund Gosse |wstitle=\u00d6hlenschl\u00e4ger, Adam Gottlob|volume=20|pages=33\u201334}}</ref>\n\nOehlenschl\u00e4ger and his sister Sophie were allowed their own way throughout their childhood, and were taught nothing, except to read and write, until their twelfth year. At the age of nine, Oehlenschl\u00e4ger began to make fluent [[Poetry|verses]]. Three years later, while walking in [[Frederiksberg Gardens]], he attracted the notice of the poet [[Edvard Storm]], and the result of the conversation was that he received a nomination to the college called Posterity's High School, an important institution of which Storm was the principal. Storm himself taught the class of [[Scandinavian mythology]], and thus Oehlenschl\u00e4ger received his earliest bias towards the poetical religion of his ancestors.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nOehlenschl\u00e4ger was [[confirmed]] in 1795, and was to have been apprenticed to a tradesman in Copenhagen. To his great delight there was a hitch in the preliminaries, and he returned to his father's house. He now, in his eighteenth year, suddenly took up study with great zeal, but soon again abandoned his books for the stage, where he was offered a small position. In 1797 he made his appearance on the boards in several successive parts, but soon discovered that he possessed no real histrionic talent. The brothers [[Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted|\u00d8rsted]], with whom he had formed an intimacy that proved quite profitable to him, persuaded him to quit the stage, and in 1800 he entered the [[University of Copenhagen]] as a student. He was doomed, however, to disturbance in his studies, first from the death of his mother, next from his inveterate tendency towards poetry, and finally from the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|First Battle of Copenhagen]] in April 1801, which, however, inspired a dramatic sketch (''April the Second 1801'') which is the first thing of the kind by Oehlenschl\u00e4ger that we possess.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[Image:Adam Gottlob Oehlenschlager by Julius Schultz in S\u00f8ndermarken 1.jpg|right|thumb|Statue of Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger in Frederiksberg Gardens (Copenhagen)]]\n\nIn the summer of 1802, when Oehlenschl\u00e4ger had an old [[Scandinavian romanser|Scandinavian romance]], as well as a volume of [[Lyric poetry|lyrics]], in the press, the young [[Nordic countries|Norse]] philosopher, [[Henrik Steffens]], came back to Copenhagen after a long visit to [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] in Germany, full of new romantic ideas. His lectures at the university, in which [[Goethe]] and [[Schiller]] were revealed to the Danish public for the first time, created a great sensation. Steffens and Oehlenschl\u00e4ger met one day at [[Dreier's Club]], and after a conversation of sixteen hours the latter went home, suppressed his two coming volumes, and wrote at a sitting his splendid poem ''Guldhornene'', in a manner totally new to Danish literature. The result of his new enthusiasm speedily showed itself in a somewhat hasty volume of poems, published in 1803, now chiefly remembered as containing the lovely piece called ''Sanct Hansaften-Spil''.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe next two years saw the production of several exquisite works, in particular the epic of ''Thors Reise til Jotunheim'', the charming poem in [[hexameter]]s called ''Langelandsreisen'', and the bewitching piece of fantasy ''Aladdin'' (1805). At the age of twenty-six, Oehlenschl\u00e4ger was universally recognised, even by the opponents of the romantic revival, as the leading poet of [[Denmark]]. He now collected his ''Poetical Writings'' in two volumes. He found no difficulty in obtaining a grant for foreign travel from the government, and he left his native country for the first time, joining Steffens at [[University of Halle|Halle]] in August 1805. Here he wrote the first of his great historical tragedies, ''Hakon Jarl'', which he sent off to Copenhagen, and then proceeded for the winter months to [[Berlin]], where he associated with [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], [[Fichte]], and the leading men of the day, and met Goethe for the first time.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn the spring of 1806 he went on to [[Weimar]], where he spent several months in daily intercourse with Goethe. The autumn of the same year he spent with [[Tieck]] in [[Dresden]], and proceeded in December to [[Paris, France|Paris]]. Here he resided eighteen months and wrote his three famous masterpieces, ''Baldur hin Gode'' (1808), ''Palnatoke'' (1809), and ''[[Axel og Valborg]]'' (1810).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>  Oehlenschl\u00e4ger had also made his own translation of ''Aladdin'' into German, adding some extra new material which does not appear in the 1805 edition; this revised version was published in Amsterdam in 1808. [[Ferruccio Busoni]] later used the text of this translation for the last (choral) movement of his [[Piano Concerto (Busoni)|Piano Concerto Op. 39]]. Later editions of Oehlenschl\u00e4ger's play do not contain this text.{{sfn|Beaumont|1985|p=62}}\n\nIn July 1808 he left Paris and spent the autumn and winter in [[Switzerland]] as the guest of [[Madame de Sta\u00ebl]] at [[Coppet]], in the midst of her circle of wits. In the spring of 1809 Oehlenschl\u00e4ger went to Rome to visit [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], and in his house wrote his tragedy of ''Correggio.'' He hurriedly returned to Denmark in the spring of 1810, partly to take the chair of [[aesthetics]] at the University of Copenhagen, partly to marry the sister-in-law of [[Rahbek]], to whom he had been long betrothed. His first course of lectures dealt with his Danish predecessor [[Johannes Ewald]], the second with Schiller. From this time forward his literary activity became very great; in 1811 he published the Oriental tale of ''Ali og Gulhyndi'', and in 1812 the last of his great tragedies, ''St\u00e6rkodder''.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFrom 1814 to 1819 he, or rather his admirers, were engaged in a long and angry controversy with [[Jens Immanuel Baggesen|Baggesen]], who represented the old [[didactic]] school. This contest seems to have disturbed the peace of Oehlenschl\u00e4ger's mind and to have undermined his genius. His talent may be said to have culminated in the glorious cycle of verse-romances called ''Helge'', published in 1814. The tragedy of ''Hagbarth og Signe'', (1815), showed a distinct falling-off in style. In 1817 he went back to Paris, and published ''Hroars Saga'' and the tragedy of ''Fostbr\u00f8drene''. In 1818 he was again in Copenhagen, and wrote the [[idyll]] of ''Den lille Hyrdedreng'' and the [[Edda]]ic cycle called ''Nordens Guder''. His next productions were the [[Tragedy|tragedies]] of ''Erik og Abel'' (1820) and ''V\u00e6ringerne i Miklagaard'' (1826), and the epic of ''Hrolf Krake'' (1829). His last volumes were ''Tordenskjold'' (1833), ''Dronning Margrethe'' (1833), ''Sokrates'' (1835), ''Olaf den Hellige'' (1836), ''Knud den Store'' (1838), ''Dina'' (1842), ''Erik Glipping'' (1843), and ''Kiartan og Gudrun'' (1847). On his seventieth birthday, 14 November 1849, a public festival was arranged in his honour, and he was decorated by the king of Denmark under circumstances of great pomp. He died on 20 January 1850 and was buried in the cemetery of Frederiksberg. Immediately after his death his ''Recollections'' were published in two volumes.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Oehlenschlaeger and Tegner.jpg|right|thumb|Oehlenschl\u00e4ger being hailed with laurels as \"The Nordic Poet-king\" by his Swedish contemporary [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]] as a gesture of [[Denmark\u2013Sweden relations|reconciliation]] between the two peoples]]\n\nWith the exception of [[Ludvig Holberg]], no Danish writer before 1870 has exercised so wide an influence as Oehlenschl\u00e4ger. His great work was to awaken in the breasts of his countrymen an enthusiasm for the poetry and religion of their ancestors, and this he performed to so complete an extent that his name remains to this day synonymous with Scandinavian romance. He supplied his countrymen with romantic tragedies at the very moment when all eyes were turned to the stage, and when the old-fashioned pieces were felt to be inadequate. His plays, partly no doubt in consequence of his own early familiarity with acting, fulfilled the stage requirements of the day, and were popular beyond all expectation. The earliest are the best: Oehlenschlager's dramatic masterpiece being, without doubt, his first tragedy, ''Hakon Jarl''. In his poems and plays alike his style is limpid, elevated, profuse; his flight is sustained at a high pitch without visible excitement. His fluent tenderness and romantic zest have been the secrets of his extreme popularity. Although his inspiration came from Germany, he is not much like a German poet, except when he is consciously following Goethe; his analogy is rather to be found among English poets than his contemporaries. His mission towards antiquity reminds us of [[Sir Walter Scott|Scott]]; he sometimes has touches of exquisite diction and of overwrought sensibility which recall [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]. In his wide ambition and profuseness he possessed some characteristics of [[Robert Southey]], although his style has far more vitality. With all his faults he was a very great writer, and one of the principal pioneers of the [[romantic movement]] in Europe.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1829 he was publicly crowned with laurel as the \"king of [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] poetry\" and the \"Scandinavian King of Song\"<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> (by Bishop [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]], who would be his Swedish parallel) in the cathedral of [[Lund]], [[Sweden]], based on a vast production of poetry, theatre plays and prose, inspired by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Gottlieb Fichte]], and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Friedrich von Schelling]]. (See also [[Jens Immanuel Baggesen]])\n\nHe wrote the song \"[[Der er et yndigt land]]\", which is now the [[national anthem]] of Denmark.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|authorlink1=Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|title=Not One but Two National Anthems|url=http://denmark.dk/en/quick-facts/national-anthems/|website=Denmark.dk|accessdate=8 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''1849''': Knight Grand Cross in the [[Order of the Dannebrog]].<ref>Handelsblad (Het) 27-11-1849</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{more footnotes|date=February 2014}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* <cite id=\"Beaumont (1985)\">{{cite book|ref=harv |last=Beaumont |first=Antony |authorlink=Antony Beaumont |year=1985|title=Busoni the Composer |location= London |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |isbn=0-571-13149-2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikisource author}}\n{{Commonscat|Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger|Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger}}\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Oehlenschl\u00e4ger,+Adam+Gottlob | name=Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger |sopt=w}} \n* {{Librivox author |id=10142}}\n*[http://runeberg.org/authors/oehlensc.html Oehlenschl\u00e4ger], author presentation in [[Project Runeberg]]\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=kHxMAAAAMAAJ ''Aladdin, or, The wonderful lamp''], by Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger, William Blackwood & Sons, 1863\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-aca}}\n{{s-bef|before = [[Jens Wilken Hornemann]]}} \n{{s-ttl|title = Rector of [[University of Copenhagen]]|years = 1831\u20131832}} \n{{s-aft|after = [[Jens M\u00f8ller]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Danish Golden Age}}\n{{Romanticism}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Oehlenschlager, Adam Gottlob}}\n[[Category:1779 births]]\n[[Category:1850 deaths]]\n[[Category:18th-century Danish poets]]\n[[Category:Danish male poets]]\n[[Category:18th-century Danish dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:National anthem writers]]\n[[Category:University of Copenhagen alumni]]\n[[Category:19th-century Danish dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:People from Copenhagen]]\n[[Category:Opera librettists]]\n[[Category:Danish people of German descent]]\n[[Category:Rectors of the University of Copenhagen]]\n[[Category:Danish male dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:19th-century Danish poets]]\n[[Category:19th-century male writers]]\n[[Category:Coppet group]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Pour le M\u00e9rite (civil class)]]\n[[Category:18th-century male writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox writer <!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] -->\n| name = Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger\n| image = Adam Oehlenschlaeger (1825 painting).jpg\n| caption = Portrait of Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger by [[Christian Albrecht Jensen]] (1825)\n| birth_date = {{Birth date|1779|11|14|df=y}}\n| birth_place = [[Copenhagen]], Denmark\n| death_date = {{death date and age|1850|1|20|1779|11|14|df=y}}\n| death_place = [[Copenhagen]], Denmark\n| occupation = Poet, playwright\n| nationality = Danish\n| genre =\n| influences =\n| signature = Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger - signature.jpg\n}}\n'''Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger'''<ref>Oehlenschl\u00e4ger's name is written with Oe and a-umlaut (\u00e4), not with the usual [[Danish language#Writing system|Danish]] \u00d8 and \u00e6.</ref> ({{IPA-da|\u02c8\u025b\u02d0t\u0251m \u02c8k\u028ctl\u028cp \u02c8\u00f8\u02c0l\u0329n\u02ccsle\u02d0j\u0250}}; 14 November 1779{{snd}}20 January 1850) was a Danish poet and playwright.

The result of his new enthusiasm speedily showed itself in a somewhat hasty volume of poems, published in 1803, now chiefly remembered as containing the lovely piece called ''Sanct Hansaften-Spil''.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nThe next two years saw the production of several exquisite works, in particular the epic of ''Thors Reise til Jotunheim'', the charming poem in [[hexameter]]s called ''Langelandsreisen'', and the bewitching piece of fantasy ''Aladdin'' (1805). At the age of twenty-six, Oehlenschl\u00e4ger was universally recognised, even by the opponents of the romantic revival, as the leading poet of [[Denmark]]. He now collected his ''Poetical Writings'' in two volumes. He found no difficulty in obtaining a grant for foreign travel from the government, and he left his native country for the first time, joining Steffens at [[University of Halle|Halle]] in August 1805. Here he wrote the first of his great historical tragedies, ''Hakon Jarl'', which he sent off to Copenhagen, and then proceeded for the winter months to [[Berlin]], where he associated with [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], [[Fichte]], and the leading men of the day, and met Goethe for the first time.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn the spring of 1806 he went on to [[Weimar]], where he spent several months in daily intercourse with Goethe. The autumn of the same year he spent with [[Tieck]] in [[Dresden]], and proceeded in December to [[Paris, France|Paris]]. Here he resided eighteen months and wrote his three famous masterpieces, ''Baldur hin Gode'' (1808), ''Palnatoke'' (1809), and ''[[Axel og Valborg]]'' (1810).<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>  Oehlenschl\u00e4ger had also made his own translation of ''Aladdin'' into German, adding some extra new material which does not appear in the 1805 edition; this revised version was published in Amsterdam in 1808. [[Ferruccio Busoni]] later used the text of this translation for the last (choral) movement of his [[Piano Concerto (Busoni)|Piano Concerto Op. 39]]. Later editions of Oehlenschl\u00e4ger's play do not contain this text.{{sfn|Beaumont|1985|p=62}}\n\nIn July 1808 he left Paris and spent the autumn and winter in [[Switzerland]] as the guest of [[Madame de Sta\u00ebl]] at [[Coppet]], in the midst of her circle of wits. In the spring of 1809 Oehlenschl\u00e4ger went to Rome to visit [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], and in his house wrote his tragedy of ''Correggio.'' He hurriedly returned to Denmark in the spring of 1810, partly to take the chair of [[aesthetics]] at the University of Copenhagen, partly to marry the sister-in-law of [[Rahbek]], to whom he had been long betrothed. His first course of lectures dealt with his Danish predecessor [[Johannes Ewald]], the second with Schiller. From this time forward his literary activity became very great; in 1811 he published the Oriental tale of ''Ali og Gulhyndi'', and in 1812 the last of his great tragedies, ''St\u00e6rkodder''.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFrom 1814 to 1819 he, or rather his admirers, were engaged in a long and angry controversy with [[Jens Immanuel Baggesen|Baggesen]], who represented the old [[didactic]] school. This contest seems to have disturbed the peace of Oehlenschl\u00e4ger's mind and to have undermined his genius. His talent may be said to have culminated in the glorious cycle of verse-romances called ''Helge'', published in 1814. The tragedy of ''Hagbarth og Signe'', (1815), showed a distinct falling-off in style. In 1817 he went back to Paris, and published ''Hroars Saga'' and the tragedy of ''Fostbr\u00f8drene''. In 1818 he was again in Copenhagen, and wrote the [[idyll]] of ''Den lille Hyrdedreng'' and the [[Edda]]ic cycle called ''Nordens Guder''. His next productions were the [[Tragedy|tragedies]] of ''Erik og Abel'' (1820) and ''V\u00e6ringerne i Miklagaard'' (1826), and the epic of ''Hrolf Krake'' (1829). His last volumes were ''Tordenskjold'' (1833), ''Dronning Margrethe'' (1833), ''Sokrates'' (1835), ''Olaf den Hellige'' (1836), ''Knud den Store'' (1838), ''Dina'' (1842), ''Erik Glipping'' (1843), and ''Kiartan og Gudrun'' (1847). On his seventieth birthday, 14 November 1849, a public festival was arranged in his honour, and he was decorated by the king of Denmark under circumstances of great pomp. He died on 20 January 1850 and was buried in the cemetery of Frederiksberg. Immediately after his death his ''Recollections'' were published in two volumes.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Oehlenschlaeger and Tegner.jpg|right|thumb|Oehlenschl\u00e4ger being hailed with laurels as \"The Nordic Poet-king\" by his Swedish contemporary [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]] as a gesture of [[Denmark\u2013Sweden relations|reconciliation]] between the two peoples]]\n\nWith the exception of [[Ludvig Holberg]], no Danish writer before 1870 has exercised so wide an influence as Oehlenschl\u00e4ger. His great work was to awaken in the breasts of his countrymen an enthusiasm for the poetry and religion of their ancestors, and this he performed to so complete an extent that his name remains to this day synonymous with Scandinavian romance. He supplied his countrymen with romantic tragedies at the very moment when all eyes were turned to the stage, and when the old-fashioned pieces were felt to be inadequate. His plays, partly no doubt in consequence of his own early familiarity with acting, fulfilled the stage requirements of the day, and were popular beyond all expectation. The earliest are the best: Oehlenschlager's dramatic masterpiece being, without doubt, his first tragedy, ''Hakon Jarl''. In his poems and plays alike his style is limpid, elevated, profuse; his flight is sustained at a high pitch without visible excitement. His fluent tenderness and romantic zest have been the secrets of his extreme popularity. Although his inspiration came from Germany, he is not much like a German poet, except when he is consciously following Goethe; his analogy is rather to be found among English poets than his contemporaries. His mission towards antiquity reminds us of [[Sir Walter Scott|Scott]]; he sometimes has touches of exquisite diction and of overwrought sensibility which recall [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]]. In his wide ambition and profuseness he possessed some characteristics of [[Robert Southey]], although his style has far more vitality. With all his faults he was a very great writer, and one of the principal pioneers of the [[romantic movement]] in Europe.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1829 he was publicly crowned with laurel as the \"king of [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] poetry\" and the \"Scandinavian King of Song\"<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> (by Bishop [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]], who would be his Swedish parallel) in the cathedral of [[Lund]], [[Sweden]], based on a vast production of poetry, theatre plays and prose, inspired by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Gottlieb Fichte]], and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Friedrich von Schelling]].

This report gave rise to the Myners Principles which formed the basis for good stewardship of the investment of pension funds and endowments.
