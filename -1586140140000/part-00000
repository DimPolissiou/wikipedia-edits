{"title_page": "Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\nThe '''Coastal coal-carrying trade of New South Wales''' involved the shipping of coal\u2014mainly for local consumption but also for export or coal bunkering\u2014by sea to Sydney from the northern and southern coal fields of [[New South Wales]]. It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791. They found \u2018fine burning coal\u2019 near a \u2018little creek\u2019 with [[Livistona australis|cabbage tree palms]] \u2018about 2 degrees\u2019 north of Sydney, 'after two days sailing'. This first hand account of the discovery\u2014written by one of the party [[James Martin (convict)|James Martin]]\u2014was found in a collection of manuscripts and published in 1937.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memorandoms by James Martin|last=Blount|first=Charles|publisher=The Rampant Lion Press|year=1937|isbn=|location=Copy held in National Library of Australia|pages=19, 20}}</ref> The escapees never returned to Sydney and their discovery of the coal remained unknown, until after they were recaptured at [[Kupang]]. William Bryant also wrote an account that is now lost but [[William Bligh]]\u2014later a governor of New South Wales\u2014saw it, when he visited Kupang in 1792. Bligh made a summary of Bryant's account in his log and quoted him as saying, \"Walking along shore towards the entrance of the Creek we found several large pieces of Coal\u2014seeing so many pieces we thought it was not unlikely to find a Mine, and searching about a little, we found a place where we picked up with an Ax as good Coals as any in England\u2014took some to the fire and they burned exceedingly well\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1558725/1/Memorandoms-by-James-Martin.pdf|title=Memorandoms by James Martin - An astonishing escape from early New South Wales|last=Causer|first=Tim|publisher=UCL Press|year=2017|isbn=9781911576815|location=|pages=24, 25, 82, 83, 130, 131}}</ref>  It is likely that the location was near the entrance to [[Glenrock Lagoon#History|Glenrock Lagoon]], where coal is exposed in the sea cliff and which was later the site of the Burwood Colliery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geomaps.com.au/scripts/glenrockstate.php|title=Glenrock State Recreation Area - Mining heritage and Dudley Beach fossilised forest|website=www.geomaps.com.au|access-date=19 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nSurvivors of the wreck of the [[Sydney Cove (1796 ship)|''Sydney Cove'']] reported seeing coal south of Sydney, after completing their 700&nbsp;km trek along the coast in May 1797.

Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction\u2014for the export market\u2014that will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st-Century.\n\n== Reasons for the trade ==\n=== Coal for Sydney ===\nCoal was needed in Sydney to feed the [[Gasworks|production of town gas]] (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail. All these power stations were situated close to the waterfront but that was to obtain cooling water not port access.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article146156281|title=THE WONDERS OF BUNNERONG|date=6 April 1932|work=Australian Worker (Sydney, NSW : 1913 - 1950)|access-date=7 August 2018|pages=18}}</ref> Two of the power stations\u2014Ultimo and White Bay\u2014initially were operated by the [[New South Wales Government Railways|railways]] and all the power stations in Sydney were built after the rail connections from the coalfields to Sydney were completed. The other power station, at Balmain, had no rail siding. It was coal-fired but also raised some steam by incinerating garbage. Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/balmain_power_station|title=Balmain Power Station {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the [[Balmain Power Station]] came by sea.\n\n=== Coal and coke for the other states ===\nIn parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.\n\n== Ships  ==\n[[File:Sixty-miler.jpg|thumb|A \"sixty-miler\" enters Newcastle Harbour in 1923.|alt=|258x258px]]\n\n=== The \u2018sixty-milers\u2019 ===\n{{Main|Sixty-miler}}\n\nCoal was carried to Sydney in ships known as \u2018sixty-milers\u2019. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Faculty of Education.|isbn=0864180020|location=[Wollongong]|oclc=27593592}}</ref>  The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] that made [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|coal mining a monopoly of that company]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\n\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

The lugs at the top were used to lift the removable hopper out of the frame by crane.|alt=|260x260px]]\n\nMany collieries on the northern coalfield of NSW were named after collieries in the United Kingdom. Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators. Larger modern bogie wagons were introduced in the 1960s and \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons were banned from Port Waratah in 1974 but continued to be used to bring coal to Hexham. There were still 3,000 in use in 1975 and 900 when the [[Richmond Vale railway line|Richmond Vale Railway]] closed in September 1987. 'Non-air' wagons came in different capacities between 7 and 12.5 tons. Large letters on the side of the wagon identified the owner, and small letters its capacity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coals to Hexham : the continuing story|last=Kenn.|first=Pearce|date=1994|publisher=Railmac Publication|others=McNicol, Steve.|isbn=0949817961|edition=[Rev. ed.]|location=Elizabeth, S.

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day. There were also some privately operated chutes capable of another 3,000 tons per day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coal Mines of Newcastle, NSW - Their Rise and Progress|last=Kingswell|first=George H.|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=https://downloads.newcastle.edu.au/library/cultural%20collections/pdf/The_coal_mines_of_Newcastle_NSW_their_rise_and_progress.pdf|pages=4}}</ref> Later some electrically operated cranes were added.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields. After 1915, four-wheel bottom dump wagons were used to bring coal to the new No.1 Jetty at Port Kembla, via an unloading rail loop and dump station.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The History and Development of Port Kembla - Paper prepared for presentation to the Engineering Conference of the Institute of Engineers Australia (30 March 1938).|last=Spooner|first=E.S|publisher=NSW Department of Public Works|year=1938|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=7}}</ref> This bottom-dumping operation was similar in concept to the coal-handling practice of today.\n\nUnlike the northern fields, mines of the southern coalfield were usually named after a locality or geographical feature and their names rarely changed over their lifetime. The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

On Belmore Basin, there were four coal staithes on the western side of the basin and two steam cranes on the eastern side. Loading at the 'Tee Wharf' was by a single steam crane. The 'Tee-Wharf' was somewhat exposed to weather from the north and north-east; the existing northern breakwater was not built until 1966-67.\n\nThe port was connected to the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] and [[Mount Pleasant, New South Wales|Mt Pleasant]] Collieries by rail lines operated by the respective collieries. Originally these were horse-drawn but later used steam locomotives.\n\nFrom 1875 to 1890, there was a cokeworks, which converted unsaleable fines to [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], some of which was loaded at the port for Sydney.\n\nBy 1927, there was only one coal staith in operation at Wollongong.

It took place in the 19th and 20th Centuries. It should not be confused with the export coal trade, which still exists today. There was also an interstate trade, carrying coal and coke to other Australian states that did not have local sources of black coal.\n\nCoal was found to the north and south of Sydney in the last years of the 18th-Century by colonial settlers. Coal seams run under Sydney but at great depth and mining these seams proved impractical. As Sydney grew in size as a city and as a major port, coal was needed for steamships, town gas production and other industrial uses.\n\nSmall ships\u2014colloquially called '[[sixty-miler]]s'\u2014carried coal to Sydney from coal ports that were established on the northern and southern coalfields of New South Wales. The coastal trade was well established by the time Sydney was first linked to the coalfields by railways. Significant customers for coal were situated on the foreshores of Sydney Harbour, the Parramatta River, and to a lesser extent Botany Bay. Steamships using Sydney loaded bunker coal there.\n\nDuring the heyday of the coastal trade, Sydney was dependent upon a constant supply of coal arriving by sea, particularly for the production of town gas and for bunkering operations. As the uses of coal declined, so did the coastal trade in the last three decades of the 20th-Century. It ended finally, around the turn of the 21st-Century, and is now largely forgotten. Few remnants of the once extensive coastal coal-carrying trade exist today.\n\n== Discovery of coal by colonists in New South Wales ==\nCoal was used as a fuel by the [[Awabakal]] people, the original inhabitants and traditional owners of what is now Lake Macquarie and Newcastle. Their word for coal was \"nikkin\". Evidence of coal use has been found in beach and dune [[middens]], on Lake Macquarie at [[Swansea Heads]] and Ham's Beach, and on the Central Coast at Mooney Beach.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.coalandcommunity.com/coal-and-the-aboriginal-people.php|title=The use of coal by Aboriginal people|website=www.coalandcommunity.com|access-date=1 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nA group of escaped convicts led by a married couple [[William Bryant (convict)|William]] and [[Mary Bryant]] were the first Europeans to find and use Australian coal, at the end of March 1791.

Some individual mines had been worked for well over a century. Indeed, it is only the more recent increased rate of extraction\u2014for the export market\u2014that will see the exhaustion of commercially viable reserves around the middle of the 21st-Century.\n\n== Reasons for the trade ==\n=== Coal for Sydney ===\nCoal was needed in Sydney to feed the [[Gasworks|production of town gas]] (from 1841 to 1971), as bunker coal for steamships, and as fuel for industrial and hospital heating boilers. Brickworks were a significant user of coal as a fuel. In the C19th and very early C20th, there was also some demand for coal as a fuel for domestic heating. Some coal also was trans-shipped and exported from Sydney.\n\nCoal seams extend under Sydney but the huge depth of these seams has resulted in only [[Balmain Colliery|very limited mining activity in Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/109307/balmains-own-coal-mine.pdf|title=Balmain's own coal mine|last=NSW Dept of Primary Industry|first=Primefacts|date=February 2007}}</ref> The coal seams of the [[Sydney Basin]] outcrop to the north, south and west of Sydney. The Metropolitan Colliery, 45&nbsp;km south of Sydney at [[Helensburgh, New South Wales|Helensburgh]], is the closest commercially viable coal mine.\n\nGiven the short distances involved, it is not immediately obvious why coal would be carried to Sydney by sea. Not all coal consumed in Sydney arrived by ship; the railways also carried coal to Sydney. However, the main railway lines from Sydney to the [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|north]] and [[South Coast Line|south]] were not completed until the late 1880s. By that time, some mines were already well established and connected to nearby ports by local rail lines, the shipping trade was well established, and many major customers already had facilities on the waterfront of the natural port of [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and were without a rail siding. Some mines had been designed to ship coal by sea only, for example [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]] (up to 1910) and the [[Wallarah Colliery]] at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. Most of the local rail lines to the mines were privately owned and used rolling stock that was not to the standards expected of main line rail operations\u2014for example wagons without air brakes\u2014and operation over government-owned lines was restricted to specific lines and not allowed on others.\n\nCoal bunkering of steamships in Sydney Harbour was a natural fit for the coastal coal trade. Sixty-milers could moor alongside a steamship and directly transfer coal to the ship's bunkers.<ref name=\":14\" /> After 1920, coal could be off-loaded at the purpose-built bunkering facility, the Ball's Head Coal Loader.<ref name=\":9\" /> Coal bunkering also took place at a 'coal wharf' at Pyrmont.<ref name=\":31\">{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article246109565|title=SONOMA SAILS|date=11 April 1927|work=Daily Telegraph (Sydney, NSW : 1883 - 1930)|access-date=7 March 2019|pages=3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New South Wales Government Railways]] were large users of coal. But once the railway from Sydney reached the western coal-fields in 1869 and later the other coal fields, they had no need for coal carried in ships.\n\nFour of the electrical power stations in Sydney\u2014[[Bunnerong Power Station|Bunnerong]] on Botany Bay, and [[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]], [[Pyrmont Power Station|Pyrmont]] and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] on Sydney Harbour\u2014were supplied with coal by rail.

The other power station, at Balmain, had no rail siding. It was coal-fired but also raised some steam by incinerating garbage. Its coal was landed from barges at the waterfront until 1965 <ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|url=https://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/balmain_power_station|title=Balmain Power Station {{!}} The Dictionary of Sydney|website=dictionaryofsydney.org|language=en|access-date=7 August 2018}}</ref> and so it seems likely that some or all of the coal for the [[Balmain Power Station]] came by sea.\n\n=== Coal and coke for the other states ===\nIn parallel to the coastal trade to Sydney, there was an interstate coastal trade in coal and coke from the same ports to other Australian states, particularly Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania where black coal was needed for steamship coal bunkering, rail transport and industrial purposes and coke was needed for smelting ores.\n\n== Ships  ==\n[[File:Sixty-miler.jpg|thumb|A \"sixty-miler\" enters Newcastle Harbour in 1923.|alt=|258x258px]]\n\n=== The \u2018sixty-milers\u2019 ===\n{{Main|Sixty-miler}}\n\nCoal was carried to Sydney in ships known as \u2018sixty-milers\u2019. The name refers to the approximate distance by sea\u2014in nautical miles\u2014from the Hunter River to Sydney.\n\nThe heyday of the 'sixty-milers' was from around 1880 to the 1960s. In 1919, a Royal Commission identified twenty-nine ships engaged in the coastal coal-carrying trade.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|title=Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Design, Construction, Management, Equipment, Manning, Leading, Navigation and Running of the Vessels Engaged in the Coastal Coal-carrying Trade in New South Wales and into the Cause or Causes of the Loss of the Colliers Undola, Myola and Tuggerah.|last=Royal Commission|publisher=NSW Government Printer|year=1920|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=1 & 2}}</ref>\n\n=== The Interstate ships ===\nThere was almost no overlap in the ships used in the two coastal coal trades.

Owners of the 'sixty-milers', during this period, most typically were coal-mines (such as Coalcliff Colliery and Wallarah Colliery), or coal-shippers or merchants (such as Scott, Fell and Company, G.S.Yuill & Co. ),<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

Faculty of Education.|isbn=0864180020|location=[Wollongong]|oclc=27593592}}</ref>  The southern coalfield collieries (Coalcliff Collieries, etc.) owned their own ships but most were chartered to the Southern Coal Owner's Agency, which operated the ships. Later companies that both owned coal mines and were also coal merchants (such as R.W.Miller and [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith Ltd]]) owned ships and ownership became more concentrated.\n\nIn the later years of the trade, one of the dominant owners was R.W. Miller<ref>{{Citation|last=Atchison|first=John|title=Miller, Robert William (1879\u20131958)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-robert-william-7588|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> and its successor companies. However, due to company takeovers and cross-ownership between R.W. Miller, Howard Smith Limited and Coal and Allied Industries, it is somewhat difficult to track ownership of vessels and loading assets of these firms. In 1989, [[Howard Smith Limited|Howard Smith]] took full ownership of R.W.Miller. Another dominant owner in the later years of the trade was the Melbourne shipping company [[McIlwraith McEachern Limited|McIlwraith McEachern]], owners of the sixty-milers whose names included 'Bank'  (''Mortlake Bank'', etc.) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flotilla-australia.com/mcmc.htm|title=FLOTILLA AUSTRALIA|website=www.flotilla-australia.com|access-date=17 November 2018}}</ref> Ownership was sometimes difficult to follow; the ''Hexham Bank'' may have been described as an 'R.W. Miller' ship when in fact it was on charter to that company from its actual owners [[McIlwraith, McEacharn & Co|McIlwraith McEacharn]]. Ships of course were bought and sold and changed ownership, while still carrying coal cargoes for their new owners; sometimes the change in ownership also resulted in the ship's name changing, such as when the ''Corrimal'' became the ''Ayrfield''.\n\nIn contrast to the 'sixty-milers', the owners of the interstate coastal ships were usually more traditional ship-owners, some of whom specialised in carrying coal and coke.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Coal ports & operations ==\n\n=== Northern Coalfields \u2014 Hunter Valley & Lake Macquarie Region ===\nCoal from the northern coalfields was loaded at [[Hexham, New South Wales#Shipping|Hexham]] on the Hunter River, [[Carrington, New South Wales|Carrington]] (The Basin, The Dyke) near [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], on Lake Macquarie, and at the ocean jetty at [[Catherine Hill Bay, New South Wales|Catherine Hill Bay]]. In the early years of the trade, coal was loaded at Newcastle itself, on the southern bank of the Hunter River, at the river port of [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]], and at a wharf at Reid's Mistake at [[Swansea Heads, New South Wales|Swansea Heads]].\n\nThe coalfields to the north of Sydney had the advantage that the Hunter River and its estuary, while not ideal, could be used as a port. Mining commenced on the northern fields first. The first coal mines were initially operated by the government using convict labour. Sporadic mining operations started around what is now Newcastle and, in 1799, a cargo of coal was shipped to Bengal aboard the ''Hunter''. The first \u2018permanent\u2019 mine at Newcastle was opened in 1804.\n\nWhen Newcastle ceased to be a penal colony in 1821, the government continued to operate the mines. [[John Bigge|Commissioner Bigge]] had recommended that the mines be given over to private operation. In 1828, there was an agreement struck between the Secretary of State for colonies and the [[Australian Agricultural Company]] that made [[Australian Agricultural Company#Short-lived coal monopoly & providing land access: disputes with James Mitchell|coal mining a monopoly of that company]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

(Photographer: Ralph Snowball)]]The monopoly was broken when challenged in 1847 by the [[J & A Brown|Brown family]], who began mining coal at Maitland and using the river port of Morpeth and undercut the price of coal mined by the AAC. Coal was accessible in many places throughout the Hunter Valley and on both the eastern and western shores of Lake Macquarie. Once the monopoly was broken, many mines were soon in operation throughout the northern coalfields.\n\nAt the end of the C19th, the four most important companies on the northern field were the [[Australian Agricultural Company]], [[J & A Brown]], Newcastle Wallsend and Scottish Australian ([[Lambton, New South Wales#Colliery|Lambton Colliery]]). Of these, only the Scottish Australian was not a member of the Associated Northern Collieries. This was essentially a cartel that divided production as quotas for each of the participating colliery owners. There was a monetary mechanism under which collieries selling above their quota compensated those selling under their quota. To avoid companies just leaving coal in the ground, quotas were adjusted based on actual sales for the previous year. The arrangement was known as \"the Vend\" and operated for most of the years between 1872 and 1893, when it collapsed due to competition in the export market.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coal mining in Newcastle, 1801\u20131900|last=1933-|first=Turner, J.

Other names referenced the coal seam being mined and that confused the locality and identity of the mine further. With changes of ownership, mine names often changed and sometimes names associated with good-quality coal were moved to completely different collieries.\n\nMost mines of the northern coalfields were connected to the ports at Hexham and Carrington by an extensive network of railway lines; some were [[New South Wales Government Railways|government lines]] and others were privately owned. Coal was loaded into four-wheel wagons owned by the mining companies. The type of four-wheel wagon used consisted of a frame with wheels and a removable wooden hopper. Trains of wagons were hauled to the port, where the removable hoppers were lifted out of the frame by a crane and dumped by opening the bottom of the hopper. They were known as 'non-air' wagons because they did not have air-brakes.\n\nAt their peak, there were 13,000 of these \u2018non-air\u2019 wagons in service, belonging to around sixty operators.

Sailing ships using the old port of Newcastle tipped [[Ballast#History|stone ballast]] in the area and, with other reclamation work, the line of The Dyke was created by 1861. The Dyke had the effect of constraining the channel of the Hunter River, so that the natural flow and tidal movement of the river tended to scour sediments from the river floor and maintain a deep-water port. Land was reclaimed behind the original Dyke, which became the large rail-yard for the port. Coal was loaded at The Dyke from 1878.\n\nThe Basin is an artificial harbour, to the west of The Dyke, which opens into the junction of Throsby Creek and the Hunter River. It was created by dredging and completed in 1888. The Basin was also used to load coal.\n\nThe Carrington coal-loaders used twelve hydraulic cranes powered by water under pressure supplied from a [[Carrington Pump House|pumphouse]] nearby. There were also three steam cranes. In 1890, this government-operated facility was capable of loading a total of 12,000 tons per day. There were also some privately operated chutes capable of another 3,000 tons per day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Coal Mines of Newcastle, NSW - Their Rise and Progress|last=Kingswell|first=George H.|publisher=|year=1890|isbn=|location=https://downloads.newcastle.edu.au/library/cultural%20collections/pdf/The_coal_mines_of_Newcastle_NSW_their_rise_and_progress.pdf|pages=4}}</ref> Later some electrically operated cranes were added.

Coal in the southern coalfields was generally more easily won than in the northern field. The coal outcropped in sea cliffs or part way up the [[Illawarra escarpment|Illawarra Escarpment]] and adit mining was feasible. [[Adit]]s were less costly to construct and operate than the shafts and sloping drifts of the northern coalfields. The southern coalfields could be worked profitably, if the problem of shipping could be solved. The absence of a suitable port held back development of the southern mines, until around 1849 when the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] mine opened.\n\nCoal from the southern coal fields, at various times, was loaded at [[Wollongong Harbour Precinct|Wollongong Harbour]] and [[Port Kembla (seaport)#History of the Port|Port Kembla]] and at the ocean jetty ports: [[Bellambi, New South Wales|Bellambi]]; [[Coalcliff, New South Wales|Coalcliff]]; Hicks Point at [[Austinmer, New South Wales|Austinmer]]; and [[Bulli Jetty, Sandon Point, New South Wales|Sandon Point, Bulli]].

At Wollongong Harbour only, some loading was done by crane using wagons with removable hoppers, similar in concept to the ones used in the northern coalfields. After 1915, four-wheel bottom dump wagons were used to bring coal to the new No.1 Jetty at Port Kembla, via an unloading rail loop and dump station.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=The History and Development of Port Kembla - Paper prepared for presentation to the Engineering Conference of the Institute of Engineers Australia (30 March 1938).|last=Spooner|first=E.S|publisher=NSW Department of Public Works|year=1938|isbn=|location=Copy held by the National Library of Australia|pages=7}}</ref> This bottom-dumping operation was similar in concept to the coal-handling practice of today.\n\nUnlike the northern fields, mines of the southern coalfield were usually named after a locality or geographical feature and their names rarely changed over their lifetime. The number of mines was also less and the mines tended to have longer lives.\n\nMost of the southern coalfield mines were members of the Southern Coal Owners' Agency, which had as one of its aims 'prevention of ruinous competition'. It was a cartel-like organisation, controlling production volume, prices, and transport costs, but only for the southern coalfields. It lasted from 1893 to 1950, being renewed every few years by agreement. Although the collieries that were members owned 'sixty-miler' ships, those ships were chartered by the Agency. The Agency managed the operations of the ships and paid the owner a monthly fee based on each ship's capacity. Although the operation of the ships may not have been profitable, the colleries seem to have seen controlling the shipping of their coal as important to ensure reliable delivery, and as a necessary cost. Collieries received an initial low payment upon delivery of their coal to a customer but also later received a share of the actual profits from all sales, in proportion to their market share.<ref>{{Cite book|title=S.S.

The 'Tee-Wharf' was somewhat exposed to weather from the north and north-east; the existing northern breakwater was not built until 1966-67.\n\nThe port was connected to the [[Mount Keira#Mining history|Mt Kiera]] and [[Mount Pleasant, New South Wales|Mt Pleasant]] Collieries by rail lines operated by the respective collieries.

The horn logo was slightly revised in 2006. The original uniform design consisted of white pants, gold trim, and either purple or white jerseys. From 1962 to 1964, the Vikings wore purple pants with their white jerseys (The Vikings, with their new uniform, still wear, on occasion, purple pants with yellow and white trim). In a design that was unique among American football teams, the white jerseys had a completely different stripe pattern, which was over the shoulders, than the purple ones, which was around the sleeve cuff. These unique shoulder stripes on the white jerseys did not appear until 1969, the year they went to their first Super Bowl. There have also been minor changes to the uniform design throughout the years, such as changing the color of the face mask from gray to white in 1980, and then to purple in 1985. In addition, the Norseman logo was added to the sleeves in 1996, and the purple jersey stripes were toned down with that change; the ''TV numbers'', previously located on the jersey sleeves, moved up to the shoulders as well that year.

The horn logo was slightly revised in 2006. The original uniform design consisted of white pants, gold trim, and either purple or white jerseys. From 1962 to 1964, the Vikings wore purple pants with their white jerseys (The Vikings, with their new uniform, still wear, on occasion, purple pants with yellow and white trim). In a design that was unique among American football teams, the white jerseys had a completely different stripe pattern, which was over the shoulders, than the purple ones, which was around the sleeve cuff. These unique shoulder stripes on the white jerseys did not appear until 1969, the year they went to their first Super Bowl. There have also been minor changes to the uniform design throughout the years, such as changing the color of the face mask from gray to white in 1980, and then to purple in 1985. In addition, the Norseman logo was added to the sleeves in 1996, and the purple jersey stripes were toned down with that change; the ''TV numbers'', previously located on the jersey sleeves, moved up to the shoulders as well that year. The Vikings continued to wear black shoes until [[Les Steckel]] became head coach in 1984; they were the last NFL team to make the change from black to white shoes.

Express I accomplished this by adding service, operating as Republic Express, to three cities using [[Handley Page Jetstream|BAe Jetstream 31]] aircraft. Within six months, Express Airlines I was operating in ten markets using nine Jetstream 31s and two [[Saab 340]] aircraft.\n\nBy its first anniversary, Republic Express, as the service was known, was operating 20 Jetstream 31s and seven Saab 340s in 32 markets. Following regulatory and shareholder approvals, [[Northwest Airlines]] acquired Republic Airlines on October 1, 1986. Subsequently, the Republic Express brand merged with the [[Northwest Airlink]] brand.\n\nOver the next decade, Express I provided airline services as Northwest Airlink to 56 cities in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and upper [[Midwestern United States|Mid-West]]. In 1997, Northwest Airlines bought Express I from Phoenix Airline Services. On April 1, 1997, Express I became a wholly owned subsidiary of Northwest Airlines. In order to consolidate the many Airlink systems operated at that time, Express I ceased flying from Minneapolis-St. Paul, and instead concentrated on the Memphis hub.\n\nIn August 1997, Express I moved its corporate headquarters to Memphis, allowing all the various departments to function from its main base of operations. On May 7, 2000, Express I became the launch operator of the [[Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet]] (CRJ) at Northwest.\n\nExpress I further expanded with the development of three additional Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul (MRO) facilities related to CRJ operations. The primary CRJ MRO is located in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and is capable of handling up to four aircraft under cover. Other two CRJ maintenance sites are located in [[Indiana]] at [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] and [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]].\n\n===Pinnacle Airlines===\nOn May 8, 2002, Express Airlines I changed its name to '''Pinnacle Airlines'''. A new [[holding company]], [[Pinnacle Airlines Corporation]], had been created earlier that year.<ref name=\"RefForBus\"/> Pinnacle Airlines, Inc was moved from Northwest Airlines, Inc to Pinnacle Airlines Corporation. Over the next decade, the parent company acquired other airlines, such as [[Colgan Air]] and [[Mesaba Airlines]].\n\nIn 2006, Northwest agreed to a new Air Service Agreement (ASA) that contracted Pinnacle to fly 124 CRJs until 2017. A clause within the ASA stipulated that if Pinnacle and the [[Air Line Pilots Association, International|Air Line Pilots Association]] did not agree on a new pilot contract by March 31, 2007, then Northwest could remove up to 17 CRJs from Pinnacle's fleet. After the deadline passed with no new pilot contract, Northwest exercised its right to remove 17 CRJs from Pinnacle, starting in September 2008 at a rate of two CRJs per month. These 17 CRJs were handed over to [[Mesaba Airlines]] in 2008, which Pinnacle's parent company later acquired in 2010.\n\nNorthwest had also allowed Pinnacle to seek flying for other carriers. On April 30, 2007, Pinnacle Airlines Corp. signed a 10-year contract with Delta Air Lines to be a Delta Connection carrier. The 16 [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ 900]]'s began delivery in November 2007 and the deliveries were completed in May 2009. The first batch of delivered aircraft were based in Atlanta and began service in December 2007. On June 10, 2008 Pinnacle announced that Delta planned to withdraw from the contract by July 31, 2008 for failure to make its timetable. However, on July 18, 2008 Delta announced that an agreement had been reached that would allow Pinnacle to continue flying for Delta under the terms of the initial contract. The remaining 4 CRJ-900s would be delivered between January and May 2009, at which point all 15 CRJ-900s would be in service for Delta Connection.<ref>{{cite news | title=Pinnacle shares soar as Delta stands by contract | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/pinnacle-airlines-shares-soar-delta/story.aspx?guid=%7BDF23AC9A-FD28-4A93-ABA9-5471487B7A65%7D&dist=msr_1 | first=Shawn | last=Langlois | work=[[MarketWatch]] | date=July 18, 2008 | accessdate=July 18, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn January 4, 2012, Pinnacle's fleet grew when its parent company moved aircraft and personnel from [[Mesaba Airlines]], which ceased operations when the operating certificate was returned to the FAA. It also acquired personnel from [[Colgan Air]] after it ceased operations on September 5, 2012.\n\n===Endeavor Air===\nOn April 1, 2012, Pinnacle's parent company and its subsidiaries filed for [[bankruptcy protection]] under [[Chapter 11]] of the United States Bankruptcy Code.<ref name=\"frequentbusinesstraveler1\"/> The airline discontinued its operation of its Saab 340 and Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft by the end of November 2012.<ref name=\"frequentbusinesstraveler1\"/> On May 1, 2013, Pinnacle Airlines Corporation emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines.<ref name=\"startribune.com\"/> After restructuring, the airline was renamed to Endeavor Air,<ref name=\"Pinmove\"/>  its headquarters were moved to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Donahoe|first=Jane|title=Pinnacle Airlines to move HQ to Minneapolis|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2013/01/24/pinnacle-airlines-to-move-hq-to.html|work=Memphis Business Journal|publisher=Stuart Chamblin|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> and agreements with Delta were made to operate 76-seat and 50-seat regional jets.<ref name=BankruptcyApproval>{{cite web|url=http://skift.com/2013/04/21/pinnacle-airlines-to-fly-exclusively-for-delta-upon-leaving-bankruptcy/ |title=Pinnacle to fly exclusively for Delta upon leaving bankruptcy |publisher=Skift.com |date=April 17, 2013|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}</ref> \n\nOn October 27, 2016, Endeavor Air adopted EDV as its new ICAO airline code and \"Endeavor\" as its callsign, replacing its previous code of FLG and \"Flagship\" callsign. The first flight to operate under the new callsign was EDV3816 from [[Qu\u00e9bec City Jean Lesage International Airport|Jean Lesage International Airport]] in [[Quebec City]] to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York\u2013JFK]].\n\nIn March 2017, Endeavor announced it would be re-opening an Atlanta crew and maintenance base, operating CRJ-200 aircraft at this hub. By July 2017, Endeavor had five crew and ten maintenance bases.\n\n===Former Pinnacle Airlines CEO shot dead===\nOn September 27, 2018, former Pinnacle Airlines CEO was shot dead in Memphis, Tennessee in an apparent [[drive by shooting]].

All sixteen passengers and both pilots were killed.  An investigation revealed that the captain had a history of intimidating and hostile behavior toward first officers.  The captain's actions during the flight led to a breakdown in communication between the pilots, who lost track of their altitude while attempting a night landing in poor weather.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-94-05 Final Report\"/>\n* On October 14, 2004, [[Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701]] crashed in a residential area in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]]. It was on an empty repositioning flight from [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], to [[Minneapolis]], and lost power in both engines when the crew attempted to exceed the [[Bombardier CRJ200|CRJ-200]]'s capabilities and reach its maximum certified operating altitude. They were unable to restart the engines, and made an unsuccessful attempt to glide the aircraft to Jefferson City. Both crew members were killed.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2007/AAR0701.pdf |title=Aircraft Accident Report, Crash of Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701, Bombardier CL-600-2B19, N8396A, Jefferson City, Missouri, October 14, 2004 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |id=NTSB/AAR-07-01 |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref>\n*On March 11, 2005, a CRJ-200 operating as Northwest Airlink Flight 2823 from [[LaGuardia Airport]] in New York to [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], ran off the runway on landing. One of the aircraft's hydraulic systems lost pressure in flight, resulting in the aircraft's ground spoilers not deploying on landing. Contributing to the incident was a crosswind approaching company and aircraft limits and reduced braking ability on the runway, which was covered with snow at the time. The aircraft suffered substantial damage from colliding with signage and lighting, and was further damaged by the crew's attempt to taxi to the gate. None of the 12 aboard were injured, and the aircraft was repaired.<ref>http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20050311-0</ref>\n*On April 12, 2007, [[Pinnacle Airlines flight 4712]] overran the runway upon landing at [[Cherry Capital Airport]] in [[Traverse City, Michigan]], after a flight from [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis]].  The CRJ-200 was damaged, but none of the 52 passengers and crew were injured. The NTSB determined that the cause of the accident was the \"pilots\u2019 decision to land at TVC without performing a landing distance assessment\" which in turn was caused by fatigued pilots and ambiguous runway condition reports from the snow plow crew operating at the time. The report recommended more landing distance training, post-accident drug testing, and further criteria for runway closures in snow and ice conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/about/Documents/SPC0901.pdf|title=2008 Annual Report to Congress |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR0802.pdf |title=Aircraft Accident Report, Runway Overrun During Landing, Pinnacle Airlines Flight 4712, Bombardier/Canadair Regional Jet CL600-2B19, N8905F, Traverse City, Michigan April 12, 2007 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |id=NTSB/AAR-08/02 |date=June 10, 2008 |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref>\n* The FAA fined Pinnacle over $1 million for allegedly operating two Canadair Regional Jets in 2009 and 2010 that were not in compliance with FAA regulations. On one of the aircraft, the flight crew performed procedures which should have been conducted by maintenance personnel; FAA inspectors had denied a request to make the work an operations task. On a second aircraft, Pinnacle is accused of failing to conduct proper monitoring of a cracked low-pressure turbine case.\n*On January 24, 2012, a Pinnacle CRJ-200 was damaged beyond repair at [[T.F.

Express I accomplished this by adding service, operating as Republic Express, to three cities using [[Handley Page Jetstream|BAe Jetstream 31]] aircraft. Within six months, Express Airlines I was operating in ten markets using nine Jetstream 31s and two [[Saab 340]] aircraft.\n\nBy its first anniversary, Republic Express, as the service was known, was operating 20 Jetstream 31s and seven Saab 340s in 32 markets. Following regulatory and shareholder approvals, [[Northwest Airlines]] acquired Republic Airlines on October 1, 1986. Subsequently, the Republic Express brand merged with the [[Northwest Airlink]] brand.\n\nOver the next decade, Express I provided airline services as Northwest Airlink to 56 cities in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] and upper [[Midwestern United States|Mid-West]]. In 1997, Northwest Airlines bought Express I from Phoenix Airline Services. On April 1, 1997, Express I became a wholly owned subsidiary of Northwest Airlines. In order to consolidate the many Airlink systems operated at that time, Express I ceased flying from Minneapolis-St. Paul, and instead concentrated on the Memphis hub.\n\nIn August 1997, Express I moved its corporate headquarters to Memphis, allowing all the various departments to function from its main base of operations. On May 7, 2000, Express I became the launch operator of the [[Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet]] (CRJ) at Northwest.\n\nExpress I further expanded with the development of three additional Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul (MRO) facilities related to CRJ operations. The primary CRJ MRO is located in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and is capable of handling up to four aircraft under cover. Other two CRJ maintenance sites are located in [[Indiana]] at [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] and [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]].\n\n===Pinnacle Airlines===\nOn May 8, 2002, Express Airlines I changed its name to '''Pinnacle Airlines'''. A new [[holding company]], [[Pinnacle Airlines Corporation]], had been created earlier that year.<ref name=\"RefForBus\"/> Pinnacle Airlines, Inc was moved from Northwest Airlines, Inc to Pinnacle Airlines Corporation. Over the next decade, the parent company acquired other airlines, such as [[Colgan Air]] and [[Mesaba Airlines]].\n\nIn 2006, Northwest agreed to a new Air Service Agreement (ASA) that contracted Pinnacle to fly 124 CRJs until 2017. A clause within the ASA stipulated that if Pinnacle and the [[Air Line Pilots Association, International|Air Line Pilots Association]] did not agree on a new pilot contract by March 31, 2007, then Northwest could remove up to 17 CRJs from Pinnacle's fleet. After the deadline passed with no new pilot contract, Northwest exercised its right to remove 17 CRJs from Pinnacle, starting in September 2008 at a rate of two CRJs per month. These 17 CRJs were handed over to [[Mesaba Airlines]] in 2008, which Pinnacle's parent company later acquired in 2010.\n\nNorthwest had also allowed Pinnacle to seek flying for other carriers. On April 30, 2007, Pinnacle Airlines Corp. signed a 10-year contract with Delta Air Lines to be a Delta Connection carrier. The 16 [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ 900]]'s began delivery in November 2007 and the deliveries were completed in May 2009. The first batch of delivered aircraft were based in Atlanta and began service in December 2007. On June 10, 2008 Pinnacle announced that Delta planned to withdraw from the contract by July 31, 2008 for failure to make its timetable. However, on July 18, 2008 Delta announced that an agreement had been reached that would allow Pinnacle to continue flying for Delta under the terms of the initial contract. The remaining 4 CRJ-900s would be delivered between January and May 2009, at which point all 15 CRJ-900s would be in service for Delta Connection.<ref>{{cite news | title=Pinnacle shares soar as Delta stands by contract | url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/pinnacle-airlines-shares-soar-delta/story.aspx?guid=%7BDF23AC9A-FD28-4A93-ABA9-5471487B7A65%7D&dist=msr_1 | first=Shawn | last=Langlois | work=[[MarketWatch]] | date=July 18, 2008 | accessdate=July 18, 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn January 4, 2012, Pinnacle's fleet grew when its parent company moved aircraft and personnel from [[Mesaba Airlines]], which ceased operations when the operating certificate was returned to the FAA. It also acquired personnel from [[Colgan Air]] after it ceased operations on September 5, 2012.\n\n===Endeavor Air===\nOn April 1, 2012, Pinnacle's parent company and its subsidiaries filed for [[bankruptcy protection]] under [[Chapter 11]] of the United States Bankruptcy Code.<ref name=\"frequentbusinesstraveler1\"/> The airline discontinued its operation of its Saab 340 and Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft by the end of November 2012.<ref name=\"frequentbusinesstraveler1\"/> On May 1, 2013, Pinnacle Airlines Corporation emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines.<ref name=\"startribune.com\"/> After restructuring, the airline was renamed to Endeavor Air,<ref name=\"Pinmove\"/>  its headquarters were moved to [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Donahoe|first=Jane|title=Pinnacle Airlines to move HQ to Minneapolis|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/memphis/news/2013/01/24/pinnacle-airlines-to-move-hq-to.html|work=Memphis Business Journal|publisher=Stuart Chamblin|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> and agreements with Delta were made to operate 76-seat and 50-seat regional jets.<ref name=BankruptcyApproval>{{cite web|url=http://skift.com/2013/04/21/pinnacle-airlines-to-fly-exclusively-for-delta-upon-leaving-bankruptcy/ |title=Pinnacle to fly exclusively for Delta upon leaving bankruptcy |publisher=Skift.com |date=April 17, 2013|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}</ref> \n\nOn October 27, 2016, Endeavor Air adopted EDV as its new ICAO airline code and \"Endeavor\" as its callsign, replacing its previous code of FLG and \"Flagship\" callsign. The first flight to operate under the new callsign was EDV3816 from [[Qu\u00e9bec City Jean Lesage International Airport|Jean Lesage International Airport]] in [[Quebec City]] to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York\u2013JFK]].\n\nIn March 2017, Endeavor announced it would be re-opening an Atlanta crew and maintenance base, operating CRJ-200 aircraft at this hub. By July 2017, Endeavor had five crew and ten maintenance bases.\n\n===Former Pinnacle Airlines CEO shot dead===\nOn September 27, 2018, former Pinnacle Airlines CEO was shot dead in Memphis, Tennessee in an apparent [[drive by shooting]].

All sixteen passengers and both pilots were killed.  An investigation revealed that the captain had a history of intimidating and hostile behavior toward first officers.  The captain's actions during the flight led to a breakdown in communication between the pilots, who lost track of their altitude while attempting a night landing in poor weather.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-94-05 Final Report\"/>\n* On October 14, 2004, [[Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701]] crashed in a residential area in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]]. It was on an empty repositioning flight from [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], to [[Minneapolis]], and lost power in both engines when the crew attempted to exceed the [[Bombardier CRJ200|CRJ-200]]'s capabilities and reach its maximum certified operating altitude. They were unable to restart the engines, and made an unsuccessful attempt to glide the aircraft to Jefferson City. Both crew members were killed.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2007/AAR0701.pdf |title=Aircraft Accident Report, Crash of Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701, Bombardier CL-600-2B19, N8396A, Jefferson City, Missouri, October 14, 2004 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |id=NTSB/AAR-07-01 |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref>\n*On March 11, 2005, a CRJ-200 operating as Northwest Airlink Flight 2823 from [[LaGuardia Airport]] in New York to [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], ran off the runway on landing. One of the aircraft's hydraulic systems lost pressure in flight, resulting in the aircraft's ground spoilers not deploying on landing. Contributing to the incident was a crosswind approaching company and aircraft limits and reduced braking ability on the runway, which was covered with snow at the time. The aircraft suffered substantial damage from colliding with signage and lighting, and was further damaged by the crew's attempt to taxi to the gate. None of the 12 aboard were injured, and the aircraft was repaired.<ref>http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20050311-0</ref>\n*On April 12, 2007, [[Pinnacle Airlines flight 4712]] overran the runway upon landing at [[Cherry Capital Airport]] in [[Traverse City, Michigan]], after a flight from [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport|Minneapolis]].  The CRJ-200 was damaged, but none of the 52 passengers and crew were injured. The NTSB determined that the cause of the accident was the \"pilots\u2019 decision to land at TVC without performing a landing distance assessment\" which in turn was caused by fatigued pilots and ambiguous runway condition reports from the snow plow crew operating at the time. The report recommended more landing distance training, post-accident drug testing, and further criteria for runway closures in snow and ice conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/about/Documents/SPC0901.pdf|title=2008 Annual Report to Congress |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/AAR0802.pdf |title=Aircraft Accident Report, Runway Overrun During Landing, Pinnacle Airlines Flight 4712, Bombardier/Canadair Regional Jet CL600-2B19, N8905F, Traverse City, Michigan April 12, 2007 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |id=NTSB/AAR-08/02 |date=June 10, 2008 |accessdate=January 14, 2015}}</ref>\n* The FAA fined Pinnacle over $1 million for allegedly operating two Canadair Regional Jets in 2009 and 2010 that were not in compliance with FAA regulations.

Michael learns that his 11-year-old cousin Tommy Biggs, whom he has not seen since a family reunion several years earlier, will soon be arriving from Montana to visit. Michael casts Tommy aside during his visit, prioritizing his social life and the demands of his girlfriend over his guest.\n\nOn Tommy's last day in California, the family [[housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] Arlene makes Michael aware of his mistreatment toward Tommy. Michael decides to take Tommy to [[Disneyland]] to make up for it. However, en route to the theme park, Michael receives a phone call from Gina pleading for him to meet her at a racetrack so she can introduce him to her father. Michael capitulates and leaves Tommy at an indoor kiddie park, then drives to the track for a brief visit. At the race track, Michael charms Gina's father over the course of a couple hours. When Michael realizes how late it is, he hurries back to pick up Tommy, and accidentally collides his [[Porsche Boxster]] with another vehicle. Afterwards upon arriving at the kiddie park, Michael learns Arlene had picked up Tommy several hours earlier. When he comes home, Tommy angrily confronts him about this. They don't tell his parents about it and Michael lies that he got the dent in his car from a [[hit-and-run]].\n\nAfter Tommy returns to Montana and during dinner, Jacy mentions that she got a call from Michael's aunt, Jules, who told her that Tommy didn't get to do much of anything. In turn, she mentions that they are very disappointed in him. Glenn confronts Michael and demands his reasons for him leaving Tommy at an indoor kiddie park, rather than cancel his plans with Gina. He claims that if he canceled on her in meeting her father and took Tommy to Disneyland, she threatened to break up with him. Glenn tells Michael off that was no excuse since Tommy was family and he should've known better. His problems become worse when the police officers come over to the house and inform his parents of the accident between him and Deidre White. This truth further enrages both Glenn and Jacy because earlier Michael claimed he was in a hit-and-run as he was leaving the horse track. The police mentions that while he did the right thing to get Deidre's information and give out his own, she wrote his license plate number on a piece of paper. Now more irritated by his selfish behavior, Glenn decrees that in order for Michael to start acting like an adult and learn responsibility: he needs to go to Montana to work on the Biggs ranch for a month. Michael refuses to go there and tries to negotiate his way out of that trip. However, Glenn makes it clear that it's not negotiable and that he and his mother are fed up with Michael's behavior. He mentions that if he and Jacy get a negative telephone call from the Biggs regarding Michael, they intend to cancel his upcoming trip with Gina to the [[French Riviera]]. Michael arrives at the ranch, where he meets Jules' ranch hands, Twister and Mule, as well as Tommy.\n\nMichael is put to work early the next morning, although every task he is assigned by Tommy is deliberately sabotaged to make his labor harder, as revenge for his earlier neglect. One example is being ordered to load wood onto a ramshackle truck, only for Mule to laugh he has not driven it for years and points out a newer pickup truck. Michael eventually confronts Tommy regarding his behavior, and reveals that he only got along with him at their family reunion years ago because they were the only children at the event. No longer caring if his parents cancel his trip to the French Riviera with Gina, Michael demands Tommy to leave him alone and let him go through the month in peace. He dejectedly agrees and believes that his cousin truly doesn't care for him. The next morning and angered over hearing about Michael's mistreatment over Tommy, Twister reprimands him for his lazy and entitled behavior. He points out that his family are grateful to do hard work and appreciate what they have. Twister mentions that he has seen how much Michael hardly appreciates the life he has and has overheard half of his phone conversations with his girlfriend, complaining about the work on the ranch. During their discussion, he is surprised to learn that the Biggs are suffering financial problems and wonders aloud why no one in his family told him this. Twister reveals that they felt like Michael doesn't care about anyone except himself and tells him to reexamine his attitude.\n\nAfter Twister's confrontation, Michael realizes how selfish he has been and begins adapting to life on the ranch. He mends his relationship with Tommy, who reveals his father was terminally ill, and his medical bills combined with the loss of labor from his death snowballed into financial woes. Michael expresses remorse over not spending time with Tommy more when he learns why Jules really sent him to LA and felt worse in not putting his social life on hold. Later, Michael is upset when Jules tells him that the ranch will be foreclosed soon because her mortgage is past due. The bank plans to auction the family's ranch and personal property at the end of the month.\n\nMichael returns to Los Angeles after a month on the ranch, now a more mature man and finding his old life no longer interesting. A jumping horse scares everyone at the track, but Michael tames it remembering his lessons from Mule. Michael ends his relationship with Gina after realizing that his parents were right and she is a rich snob. When Michael chastises his father for not helping the Biggs, he learns that Glenn had tried to help them out. He mentions to Michael that he offered them financial aid to keep the ranch from being foreclosed. However, Jules was too prideful to accept it to the point that not even Glenn and Jacy could get her to change her mind. Michael sells his Porsche and returns to Montana to present the money from the sale to keep the ranch operational until a permanent solution can be devised. Jules graciously rejects Michael's offer and suggests that it is time for she and Tommy to move on.\n\nOn the day of the auction, Michael recalls a real estate class he took that taught about the concept of a [[land trust]], which, if arranged in conjunction with the bank, would allow the Biggs to remain on the property indefinitely regardless of the debt. Michael successfully negotiates the terms with the bank. Jules agrees to let Michael continue working on the ranch and spend more time with the family. Later, Tommy and Michael finish a tree house that Tommy's father had been working on prior to his illness.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joey Lawrence|Joseph Lawrence]] as Michael Woods\n* [[Andrew Lawrence (actor)|Andrew Lawrence]] as Tommy Biggs\n* [[Susan Walters]] as Jules Biggs\n* [[M.C.

Michael learns that his 11-year-old cousin Tommy Biggs, whom he has not seen since a family reunion several years earlier, will soon be arriving from Montana to visit. Michael casts Tommy aside during his visit, prioritizing his social life and the demands of his girlfriend over his guest.\n\nOn Tommy's last day in California, the family [[housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] Arlene makes Michael aware of his mistreatment toward Tommy. Michael decides to take Tommy to [[Disneyland]] to make up for it. However, en route to the theme park, Michael receives a phone call from Gina pleading for him to meet her at a racetrack so she can introduce him to her father. Michael capitulates and leaves Tommy at an indoor kiddie park, then drives to the track for a brief visit. At the race track, Michael charms Gina's father over the course of a couple hours. When Michael realizes how late it is, he hurries back to pick up Tommy, and accidentally collides his [[Porsche Boxster]] with another vehicle. Afterwards upon arriving at the kiddie park, Michael learns Arlene had picked up Tommy several hours earlier. When he comes home, Tommy angrily confronts him about this. They don't tell his parents about it and Michael lies that he got the dent in his car from a [[hit-and-run]].\n\nAfter Tommy returns to Montana and during dinner, Jacy mentions that she got a call from Michael's aunt, Jules, who told her that Tommy didn't get to do much of anything. In turn, she mentions that they are very disappointed in him. Glenn confronts Michael and demands his reasons for him leaving Tommy at an indoor kiddie park, rather than cancel his plans with Gina. He claims that if he canceled on her in meeting her father and took Tommy to Disneyland, she threatened to break up with him. Glenn tells Michael off that was no excuse since Tommy was family and he should've known better. His problems become worse when the police officers come over to the house and inform his parents of the accident between him and Deidre White. This truth further enrages both Glenn and Jacy because earlier Michael claimed he was in a hit-and-run as he was leaving the horse track. The police mentions that while he did the right thing to get Deidre's information and give out his own, she wrote his license plate number on a piece of paper. Now more irritated by his selfish behavior, Glenn decrees that in order for Michael to start acting like an adult and learn responsibility: he needs to go to Montana to work on the Biggs ranch for a month. Michael refuses to go there and tries to negotiate his way out of that trip. However, Glenn makes it clear that it's not negotiable and that he and his mother are fed up with Michael's behavior. He mentions that if he and Jacy get a negative telephone call from the Biggs regarding Michael, they intend to cancel his upcoming trip with Gina to the [[French Riviera]]. Michael arrives at the ranch, where he meets Jules' ranch hands, Twister and Mule, as well as Tommy.\n\nMichael is put to work early the next morning, although every task he is assigned by Tommy is deliberately sabotaged to make his labor harder, as revenge for his earlier neglect.
