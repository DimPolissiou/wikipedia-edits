{"title_page": "Adaptation (eye)", "text_new": "In [[visual perception|visual]] [[physiology]], '''adaptation''' is the ability of the [[retina]] of the [[human eye|eye]] to adjust to various levels of light. Natural [[night vision]], or [[scotopic vision]], is the ability to see under low-light conditions. In humans, [[rod cell]]s are exclusively responsible for night vision as [[cone cell]]s are only able to function at higher illumination levels.<ref name=\"Miller\">Miller, R. E., & Tredici, T. J. (1992). Night vision manual for the flight surgeon. PN.</ref>  Night vision is of lower quality than day vision because it is limited in [[Optical resolution|resolution]] and colors cannot be discerned; only shades of gray are seen.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>  In order for humans to transition from day to night vision they must undergo a '''dark adaptation''' period of up to two hours\n<ref>Rebecca Holmes, \u201cSeeing single photons\u201d. Physics World, December 2016. http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/pdf/PWDec16Holmes.pdf</ref> in which each eye adjusts from a high to a low luminescence \"setting\", increasing sensitivity hugely, by many orders of magnitude.<ref name=\"Miller\"/>  This adaptation period is different between rod and cone cells and results from the regeneration of [[photopigments]] to increase retinal sensitivity.<ref name=\"Miller\"/> Light adaptation, in contrast, works very quickly, within seconds.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Efficiency ==\nThe human eye can function from very dark to very bright levels of light; its sensing capabilities reach across nine [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]]. This means that the brightest and the darkest light signal that the eye can sense are a factor of roughly 1,000,000,000 apart. However, in any given moment of time, the eye can only sense a [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] ratio of 1,000. What enables the wider reach is that the eye adapts its definition of what is black.\n\nThe eye takes approximately 20\u201330 minutes to fully adapt from bright sunlight to complete darkness and becomes 10,000 to 1,000,000 times more sensitive than at full daylight. In this process, the eye's perception of color changes as well (this is called the [[Purkinje effect]]). However, it takes approximately five minutes for the eye to adapt from darkness to bright sunlight. This is due to cones obtaining more sensitivity when first entering the dark for the first five minutes but the rods taking over after five or more minutes.<ref name=\"eye, human\">\"Sensory Reception: Human Vision: Structure and Function of the Human Eye\"  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, vol. 27, 1987</ref> [[Cone cells]] are able to regain maximum retinal sensitivity in 9\u201310 minutes of darkness whereas rods require 30\u201345 minutes to do so.<ref name=\"Sensory\">\"Sensory Reception: Human Vision: Structure and function of the Human Eye\" vol. 27, p. 179 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1987</ref>\n\nDark adaptation is far quicker and deeper in young people than the elderly.<ref name=\"effect of age\">{{cite journal | pmid = 10748929 | volume=39 | issue=23 | title=Aging and dark adaptation |vauthors=Jackson GR, Owsley C, McGwin G Jr | journal=Vision Res | pages=3975\u201382 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(99)00092-9| year=1999 }}</ref>\n\n=== Cones vs. rods ===\n{{See also|Photoreceptor cell}}\n[[File:Cone-response-en.svg|thumb|upright=2|Normalised absorption spectra of the three human photopsins and of human rhodopsin (dashed).]]\nThe human eye contains two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones, which can be easily distinguished by their structure.  Cone photoreceptors are conical in shape and contain cone [[opsin]]s as their visual pigments.  There exist three types of cone photoreceptors, each being maximally sensitive to a specific wavelength of light depending on the structure of their opsin photopigment.<ref name=\"Kolb\">[http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-ii-anatomy-and-physiology-of-the-retina/photoreceptors/ Link], Kolb, H. (n.d.). Photoreceptors.</ref>  The various cone cells are maximally sensitive to either short wavelengths (blue light), medium wavelengths (green light), or long wavelengths (red light).  Rod photoreceptors only contain one type of photopigment, rhodopsin, which has a peak sensitivity at a wavelength of approximately 530 nanometers which corresponds to blue-green light.<ref name=\"Kolb\"/>\n\tThe distribution of photoreceptor cells across the surface of the retina has important consequences for vision.<ref name=\"Purves\">Purves, D., Augustine, G. J., & Fitzpatrick, D. (2001). Neuroscience. (2nd ed.). Sinauer Associates.</ref>  Cone photoreceptors are concentrated in a depression in the center of the retina known as the [[fovea centralis]] and decrease in number towards the periphery of the retina.<ref name=\"Purves\"/>  Conversely, rod photoreceptors are present at high density throughout the most of the retina with a sharp decline in the fovea.  Perception in high luminescence settings is dominated by cones despite the fact that they are greatly outnumbered by rods (approximately 4.5 million to 91 million).<ref name=\"Purves\"/>\n\n== Ambient light response ==\n[[File:Dark Adaptation.png|thumbnail|right|Visual Response to Darkness. Cones work at high light levels (during the day but also during driving at night in the headlamp spotlight; rods take over at twilight and night. The y-axis has logarithmic scaling.]]\n\nA minor mechanism of adaptation is the [[pupillary light reflex]], adjusting the amount of light that reaches the retina very quickly by about a factor of ten. Since it constributes only a tiny fraction of the overall adaptation to light it is not further considered here.\n\nIn response to varying ambient light levels, [[rods and cones]] of eye function both in isolation and in tandem to adjust the visual system. Changes in the sensitivity of rods and cones in the eye are the major contributors to dark adaptation.\n\nAbove a certain [[luminance]] level (about 0.03&nbsp;cd/m{{sup|2}}), the cone mechanism is involved in mediating vision; [[photopic vision]]. Below this level, the rod mechanism comes into play providing [[scotopic vision|scotopic (night) vision]]. The range where two mechanisms are working together is called the [[Mesopic vision|mesopic range]], as there is not an abrupt transition between the two mechanism. This adaptation forms the basis of the '''Duplicity Theory'''.<ref name=\"Light_Dark\">{{cite web|url=http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-viii-gabac-receptors/light-and-dark-adaptation/|title=Light and Dark Adaptation by Michael Kalloniatis and Charles Luu \u2013 Webvision|website=webvision.med.utah.edu}}</ref>\n\n== Advantages of night vision ==\n{{See also|Night vision}}\n[[File:TapetumLucidum.JPG|thumb|Reflection of camera flash from ''[[tapetum lucidum]]'']]\n\nMany animals such as [[cat]]s possess high-resolution night vision, allowing them to discriminate objects with high frequencies in low illumination settings.

Like many predatory animals humans can use their night vision to prey upon and ambush other animals without their awareness.  Furthermore, in the event of an emergency situation occurring at night humans can increase their chances of survival if they are able to perceive their surroundings and get to safety.  Both of these benefits can be used to explain why humans did not completely lose the ability to see in the dark from their nocturnal ancestors.<ref name=\"Hall\">{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = M.

Long wavelengths, such as extreme red, create the absence of a distinct rod/cone break as the rod and cone cells have similar sensitivities to light of long wavelengths.

Together with the bleaching of a [[Photoreceptor cell|rod or cone pigment]], merging of signals on [[retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cells]] are inhibited, reducing convergence. \n\nAlpha adaptation, ''i.e.'', rapid sensitivity fluctuations, is powered by nerve control. The merging of signals by virtue of the diffuse ganglion cells, as well as horizontal and amacrine cells, allow a cumulative effect.  Thus that area of stimulation is inversely proportional to intensity of light, a strong stimulus of 100 rods equivalent to a weak stimulus of 1,000 rods.\n\nIn sufficiently bright light, convergence is low, but during dark adaptation, convergence of rod signals boost. This is not due to structural changes, but by a possible shutdown of inhibition that stops convergence of messages in bright light. If only one eye is open, the closed eye must adapt separately upon reopening to match the already adapted eye.<ref name=\"eye, human\" />\n\n=== Measuring Dark Adaptation ===\nOphthalmologists sometimes measure patients' dark adaptation using an instrument known as a dark adaptometer. Currently, there is one commercially available dark adaptometer, called the [https://www.maculogix.com/dark-adaptation AdaptDx]. It works by measuring a patient's Rod Intercept (RI) time. RI is the number of minutes it takes for the eye to adapt from bright light to darkness. This RI number provides a clear and objective measurement of retinal function with 90% sensitivity and specificity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=GR|year=2014|title=Diagnostic Sensitivity and Specificity of Dark Adaptometry for Detection of Age-Related Macular Degeneration|journal=Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci|volume=55 | issue = 3 |pages=1427\u20131431|via=|pmc=3954002|pmid=24550363|doi=10.1167/iovs.13-13745}}</ref> Basically, an RI of less than 6.5 minutes indicates a healthy dark adaptation function.  However, an RI higher than 6.5 indicates impaired dark adaptation.\n\n==== Using Dark Adaptation Measurement to Diagnose Disease ====\nNumerous clinical studies have shown that dark adaptation function is dramatically impaired from the earliest stages of AMD, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and other retinal diseases, with increasing impairment as the diseases progress.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Owsley|first=C.|last2=Jackson|first2=G.

Eventually, these deposits become clinically-visible drusen that affect photoreceptor health, causing inflammation and a predisposition to choroidal neovascularization (CNV). During the AMD disease course, the RPE/Bruch's function continues to deteriorate, hampering nutrient and oxygen transport to the rod and cone photoreceptors. As a side effect of this process, the photoreceptors exhibit impaired dark adaptation because they require these nutrients for replenishment of photopigments and clearance of opsin to regain scotopic sensitivity after light exposure.\n\nMeasurement of a patient's dark adaptation function is essentially a bioassay of the health of their Bruch's membrane. As such, research has shown that, by measuring dark adaptation, doctors can detect subclinical AMD at least three years earlier than it is clinically evident.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Owsley|first=Cynthia|last2=McGwin|first2=Gerald|last3=Clark|first3=Mark E.|last4=Jackson|first4=Gregory R.|last5=Callahan|first5=Michael A.|last6=Kline|first6=Lanning B.|last7=Witherspoon|first7=C.

This means that the brightest and the darkest light signal that the eye can sense are a factor of roughly 1,000,000,000 apart. However, in any given moment of time, the eye can only sense a [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] ratio of 1,000. What enables the wider reach is that the eye adapts its definition of what is black.\n\nThe eye takes approximately 20\u201330 minutes to fully adapt from bright sunlight to complete darkness and becomes 10,000 to 1,000,000 times more sensitive than at full daylight. In this process, the eye's perception of color changes as well (this is called the [[Purkinje effect]]). However, it takes approximately five minutes for the eye to adapt from darkness to bright sunlight. This is due to cones obtaining more sensitivity when first entering the dark for the first five minutes but the rods taking over after five or more minutes.<ref name=\"eye, human\">\"Sensory Reception: Human Vision: Structure and Function of the Human Eye\"  Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, vol. 27, 1987</ref> [[Cone cells]] are able to regain maximum retinal sensitivity in 9\u201310 minutes of darkness whereas rods require 30\u201345 minutes to do so.<ref name=\"Sensory\">\"Sensory Reception: Human Vision: Structure and function of the Human Eye\" vol. 27, p. 179 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1987</ref>\n\nDark adaptation is far quicker and deeper in young people than the elderly.<ref name=\"effect of age\">{{cite journal | pmid = 10748929 | volume=39 | issue=23 | title=Aging and dark adaptation |vauthors=Jackson GR, Owsley C, McGwin G Jr | journal=Vision Res | pages=3975\u201382 | doi=10.1016/s0042-6989(99)00092-9| year=1999 }}</ref>\n\n=== Cones vs. rods ===\n{{See also|Photoreceptor cell}}\n[[File:Cone-response-en.svg|thumb|upright=2|Normalised absorption spectra of the three human photopsins and of human rhodopsin (dashed).]]\nThe human eye contains two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones, which can be easily distinguished by their structure.  Cone photoreceptors are conical in shape and contain cone [[opsin]]s as their visual pigments.  There exist three types of cone photoreceptors, each being maximally sensitive to a specific wavelength of light depending on the structure of their opsin photopigment.<ref name=\"Kolb\">[http://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-ii-anatomy-and-physiology-of-the-retina/photoreceptors/ Link], Kolb, H. (n.d.). Photoreceptors.</ref>  The various cone cells are maximally sensitive to either short wavelengths (blue light), medium wavelengths (green light), or long wavelengths (red light).  Rod photoreceptors only contain one type of photopigment, rhodopsin, which has a peak sensitivity at a wavelength of approximately 530 nanometers which corresponds to blue-green light.<ref name=\"Kolb\"/>\n\tThe distribution of photoreceptor cells across the surface of the retina has important consequences for vision.<ref name=\"Purves\">Purves, D., Augustine, G. J., & Fitzpatrick, D. (2001). Neuroscience. (2nd ed.). Sinauer Associates.</ref>  Cone photoreceptors are concentrated in a depression in the center of the retina known as the [[fovea centralis]] and decrease in number towards the periphery of the retina.<ref name=\"Purves\"/>  Conversely, rod photoreceptors are present at high density throughout the most of the retina with a sharp decline in the fovea.  Perception in high luminescence settings is dominated by cones despite the fact that they are greatly outnumbered by rods (approximately 4.5 million to 91 million).<ref name=\"Purves\"/>\n\n== Ambient light response ==\n[[File:Dark Adaptation.png|thumbnail|right|Visual Response to Darkness. Cones work at high light levels (during the day but also during driving at night in the headlamp spotlight; rods take over at twilight and night. The y-axis has logarithmic scaling.]]\n\nA minor mechanism of adaptation is the [[pupillary light reflex]], adjusting the amount of light that reaches the retina very quickly by about a factor of ten. Since it constributes only a tiny fraction of the overall adaptation to light it is not further considered here.\n\nIn response to varying ambient light levels, [[rods and cones]] of eye function both in isolation and in tandem to adjust the visual system. Changes in the sensitivity of rods and cones in the eye are the major contributors to dark adaptation.\n\nAbove a certain [[luminance]] level (about 0.03&nbsp;cd/m{{sup|2}}), the cone mechanism is involved in mediating vision; [[photopic vision]]. Below this level, the rod mechanism comes into play providing [[scotopic vision|scotopic (night) vision]]. The range where two mechanisms are working together is called the [[Mesopic vision|mesopic range]], as there is not an abrupt transition between the two mechanism.

Like many predatory animals humans can use their night vision to prey upon and ambush other animals without their awareness.  Furthermore, in the event of an emergency situation occurring at night humans can increase their chances of survival if they are able to perceive their surroundings and get to safety.  Both of these benefits can be used to explain why humans did not completely lose the ability to see in the dark from their nocturnal ancestors.<ref name=\"Hall\">{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = M.

Long wavelengths, such as extreme red, create the absence of a distinct rod/cone break as the rod and cone cells have similar sensitivities to light of long wavelengths.

Together with the bleaching of a [[Photoreceptor cell|rod or cone pigment]], merging of signals on [[retinal ganglion cell|ganglion cells]] are inhibited, reducing convergence. \n\nAlpha adaptation, ''i.e.'', rapid sensitivity fluctuations, is powered by nerve control. The merging of signals by virtue of the diffuse ganglion cells, as well as horizontal and amacrine cells, allow a cumulative effect.  Thus that area of stimulation is inversely proportional to intensity of light, a strong stimulus of 100 rods equivalent to a weak stimulus of 1,000 rods.\n\nIn sufficiently bright light, convergence is low, but during dark adaptation, convergence of rod signals boost. This is not due to structural changes, but by a possible shutdown of inhibition that stops convergence of messages in bright light. If only one eye is open, the closed eye must adapt separately upon reopening to match the already adapted eye.<ref name=\"eye, human\" />\n\n=== Measuring Dark Adaptation ===\nOphthalmologists sometimes measure patients' dark adaptation using an instrument known as a dark adaptometer. Currently, there is one commercially available dark adaptometer, called the [https://www.maculogix.com/dark-adaptation AdaptDx]. It works by measuring a patient's Rod Intercept (RI) time. RI is the number of minutes it takes for the eye to adapt from bright light to darkness. This RI number provides a clear and objective measurement of retinal function with 90% sensitivity and specificity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=GR|year=2014|title=Diagnostic Sensitivity and Specificity of Dark Adaptometry for Detection of Age-Related Macular Degeneration|journal=Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci|volume=55 | issue = 3 |pages=1427\u20131431|via=|pmc=3954002|pmid=24550363|doi=10.1167/iovs.13-13745}}</ref> Basically, an RI of less than 6.5 minutes indicates a healthy dark adaptation function.  However, an RI higher than 6.5 indicates impaired dark adaptation.\n\n==== Using Dark Adaptation Measurement to Diagnose Disease ====\nNumerous clinical studies have shown that dark adaptation function is dramatically impaired from the earliest stages of AMD, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and other retinal diseases, with increasing impairment as the diseases progress.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Owsley|first=C.|last2=Jackson|first2=G.

Eventually, these deposits become clinically-visible drusen that affect photoreceptor health, causing inflammation and a predisposition to choroidal neovascularization (CNV). During the AMD disease course, the RPE/Bruch's function continues to deteriorate, hampering nutrient and oxygen transport to the rod and cone photoreceptors. As a side effect of this process, the photoreceptors exhibit impaired dark adaptation because they require these nutrients for replenishment of photopigments and clearance of opsin to regain scotopic sensitivity after light exposure.\n\nMeasurement of a patient's dark adaptation function is essentially a bioassay of the health of their Bruch's membrane. As such, research has shown that, by measuring dark adaptation, doctors can detect subclinical AMD at least three years earlier than it is clinically evident.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Owsley|first=Cynthia|last2=McGwin|first2=Gerald|last3=Clark|first3=Mark E.|last4=Jackson|first4=Gregory R.|last5=Callahan|first5=Michael A.|last6=Kline|first6=Lanning B.|last7=Witherspoon|first7=C.

Vitamin a.</ref>\n\n==== Sources of vitamin A ====\nVitamin A is present in both animal and plant sources as retinoids and carotenoids, respectively.<ref name=\"Dieticians\"/>  Retinoids can be used immediately by the body upon absorption into the cardiovascular system; however, plant-based carotenoids must be converted to retinol prior to utilization by the body.<ref name=\"Dieticians\"/>  The highest animal-based sources of vitamin A are liver, dairy products, and fish.<ref name=\"Dieticians\"/>  Fruits and vegetables containing high amounts of carotenoids are dark green, yellow, orange, and red in colour.<ref name=\"Dieticians\"/>\n\n==== Evolutionary context ====\nVitamin A-based opsin proteins have been used for sensing light in organisms for most of evolutionary history beginning approximately 3 billion years ago.<ref name=\"Zhong\">{{cite journal | last1 = Zhong | first1 = M. | last2 = Kawaguchi | first2 = R. | last3 = Kassai | first3 = M. | last4 = Sun | first4 = H. | year = 2012 | title = Retina, retinol, retinal and the natural history of vitamin a as a light sensor | url = | journal = Nutrients | volume = 4 | issue = 12| pages = 2069\u20132096 | doi = 10.3390/nu4122069 | pmid = 23363998 | pmc = 3546623 }}</ref>  This feature has been passed from unicellular to multicellular organisms including Homo sapiens.<ref name=\"Zhong\"/>  This vitamin was most likely selected by evolution for sensing light because retinal causes a shift in photoreceptor absorbance to the visible light range.<ref name=\"Zhong\"/>  This shift in absorbance is especially important for life on Earth because it generally matches the peak irradiance of sunlight on its surface.<ref name=\"Zhong\"/>  A second reason why retinal evolved to be vital for human vision is because it undergoes a large conformational change when exposed to light.<ref name=\"Zhong\"/>  This conformational change is believed to make it easier for the photoreceptor protein to distinguish between its silent and activated state thus better controlling visual phototransduction.<ref name=\"Zhong\"/>\n\n==== Experimental evidence ====\nVarious studies have been conducted testing the effective of vitamin A supplementation on dark adaptation.  In a study by Cideciyan et al. the length of dark adaptation was measured in a patient with systemic vitamin A deficiency (VAD) before and after vitamin A supplementation.<ref name=\"Cid\">{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = | title = Rod plateaux during dark adaptation in sorsby's fundus dystrophy and vitamin a deficiency | url = | journal = Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science | volume = 38 | issue = 9| pages = 1786\u20131794 }}</ref>  The dark adaptation function was measured prior to supplementation, 1 day post-treatment, and 75 days post-treatment.

(2001). What are anthocyanins?</ref>  These chemicals are also the most visible of the flavonoid phytochemicals because they provide bright blue, red, or purple pigmentation to many plant species.<ref name=\"Sterling\"/>  Anthocyanins also serve to protect the photosynthetic tissues from the direct rays of the sun.<ref name=\"Inno\">[http://www.innovateus.net/food/what-are-benefits-anthocyanidins], Innovateus. (n.d.). What are the benefits of anthocyanidins?</ref>\nIn addition, the [[antioxidant]], anti-inflammatory, and vasoprotective properties of anthocyanins allow them to demonstrate diverse health effects.<ref name=\"Sterling\"/>  In humans, anthocyanins are effective for a variety of health conditions including neurological damage, atherosclerosis, diabetes, as well as visual impairment.<ref name=\"Inno\"/>  Anthocyanins frequently interact with other phytochemicals to potentiate biological effects; therefore, contributions from individual biomolecules remains difficult to decipher.<ref name=\"Lila\"/>\nAs a result of anthocyanins providing bright colouration to flowers, the plants containing these phytochemicals are naturally successful in attracting pollinators such as birds and bees.<ref name=\"Inno\"/>  The fruits and vegetables produced by such plants are also brightly pigmented attracting animals to eat them and disperse the seeds.<ref name=\"Inno\"/>  Due to this natural mechanism anthocyanin-containing plants are widely abundant in most areas of the world.  The high abundance and distribution of anthocyanin-containing plants make it a natural food source for many animals.  Through fossil evidence it is known that these compounds were eaten in high amounts by primitive hominins.<ref name=\"Sterling\"/>\n\nDuring World Wars I and II British Air Force aviators were known to consume extensive amounts of bilberry jam.  The aviators consumed this anthocyanin-rich food due to its many visual benefits, included accelerated dark adaptation, which would be valuable for night bombing missions.<ref name=\"Losso\">Losso, J.

This makes sense intuitively because anthocyanins offer pigmentation to plants.  Blackberries are the most anthocyanin-rich foods, containing 89-211 milligrams per 100 grams.<ref name=\"Inno\"/>  Other foods that are rich in this phytochemical include red onions, blueberries, bilberries, red cabbage, and eggplant.<ref name=\"Inno\"/>  The ingestion of any of these food sources will yield a variety of phytochemicals in addition to anthocyanins because they naturally exist together.<ref name=\"Lila\"/>  The daily intake of anthocyanins is estimated to be approximately 200 milligrams in the average adult; however, this value can reach several grams per day if an individual is consuming flavonoid supplements.<ref name=\"Lila\"/>\n\n==== Effect on dark adaptation====\nAnthocyanins accelerate dark adaptation in humans by enhancing the regeneration of the rod photopigment, rhodopsin.<ref name=\"Tiru\">{{cite journal | last1 = Tirupula | first1 = K.

By having a diet rich in anthocyanins an individual is able to generate rhodopsin in shorter periods of time because of the increased affinity of opsin to retinal.<ref name=\"Tiru\"/>  Through this mechanism an individual is able to accelerate dark adaptation and achieve night vision in a shorter period of time.\n\n==== Supportive evidence ====\nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted by Nakaishi et al. a powdered anthocyanin concentrate derived from black currants was provided to a number of participants.<ref name=\"Naka\">{{cite journal | last1 = Nakaishi | first1 = H. | last2 = Matsumoto | first2 = H. | last3 = Tominaga | first3 = S. | last4 = Hirayama | first4 = M. | year = 2000 | title = Effects of black currant anthocyanoside intake on dark adaptation and vdt work-induced transient refractive alteration in healthy humans | url = | journal = Alternative Medicine Review | volume = 5 | issue = 6| pages = 553\u2013562 }}</ref>{{ums|date=December 2017}}  Participants received one of three doses of anthocyanins to measure if the result occurred in a dose-dependent manner.

The process for light adaptation occurs over a period of five minutes.\n\nThe photochemical reaction is:\n: Rhodopsin \u21cc retinal + opsin\n\n=== Increment threshold ===\n[[File:Light adaptation.png|thumbnail|Schematic of the increment threshold curve of the rod system]]\nUsing increment threshold experiments, light adaptation can be measured clinically.<ref>H Davson. Physiology of the eye. 5th ed. London: Macmillan Academic and Professional Ltd.; 1990.</ref> In an increment threshold experiment, a test stimulus is presented on a background of a certain [[luminance]], the stimulus is increased until the detection threshold is reached against the background. A monophasic or biphasic threshold versus intensity TVI curve is obtained through this method for both [[Photoreceptor cell|cones and rods]].\n\nWhen the threshold curve for a single system (i.e., [[Photoreceptor cell|just cones or just rods]]) is taken in isolation it can be seen to possesses four sections:<ref>Aguilar M, Stiles WS. Saturation of the rod mechanism of the retina at high levels of stimulation. Opt Acta (Lond) 1954;1:59\u201365.</ref>\n\n;1. Dark light: The threshold in this portion of the TVI curve is determined by the dark/light level.  Sensitivity is limited by neural noise.  The background field is relatively low and does not significantly affect threshold.\n;2. Square root law: This part of the curve is limited by quantal fluctuation in the background.  The visual system is usually compared with a theoretical construct called the ideal light detector.  To detect the stimulus, the stimulus must sufficiently exceed the fluctuations of the background (noise).\n;3. Weber's law: Threshold increases with background [[luminance]] proportional to the square root of the background.<ref>{{Cite journal|pages=337\u2013350|pmid=13539843|pmc=1358805|year=1958|author1=Barlow|first1=H.

Left: good night vision. Right: nightblind.]]\nInsufficiency of adaptation most commonly presents as insufficient adaptation to dark environment, called [[night blindness]] or ''nyctalopia''.<ref name=\"Wolf\"/> The opposite problem, known as [[hemeralopia]], that is, inability to see clearly in bright light, is much rarer.\n\nThe [[Fovea centralis in macula|fovea]] is blind to dim light (due to its cone-only array) and the rods are more sensitive, so a dim star on a moonless night must be [[Averted vision|viewed from the side]], so it stimulates the rods. This is not due to pupil width since an artificial fixed-width pupil gives the same results.<ref name=\"eye, human\" />\n\nNight blindness can be caused by a number of factors the most common of which being vitamin A deficiency.  If detected early enough nyctalopia can be reversed and visual function can be regained; however; prolonged vitamin A deficiency can lead to permanent visual loss if left untreated.<ref name=\"Clifford\">{{cite journal | year = 2013| title = Reversible night blindness \u2013 a reminder of the increasing importance of vitamin a deficiency in the developed world | url = | journal = Journal of Optometry | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 173\u2013174 | doi=10.1016/j.optom.2013.01.002 | last1 = Clifford | first1 = Luke J. | last2 = Turnbull | first2 = Andrew M.J. | last3 = Denning | first3 = Anne M.| pmc = 3880510 }}</ref>\n\nNight blindness is especially prominent in developing countries due to [[malnutrition]] and therefore a lack of vitamin A in the diet.<ref name=\"Clifford\"/>  In developed countries night blindness has historically been uncommon due to adequate food availability; however, the incidence is expected to increase as obesity becomes more common.  Increased obesity rates correspond to an increased number of bariatric surgeries, causing malabsorption of vitamin A in the human body.<ref name=\"Clifford\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Accelerating dark adaptation in humans]]\n*[[Accommodation (eye)]]\n*[[Adaptive system]]\n*[[Dark adaptor goggles]]\n*[[Human eye]]\n*[[Mesopic vision]]\n*[[Neural adaptation]]\n*[[Purkinje effect]]\n*[[Retina]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MeshName|Adaptation,+Ocular}}\n*[https://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-viii-psychophysics-of-vision/light-and-dark-adaptation/ Light and Dark Adaptation by Michael Kalloniatis and Charles Luu]\n\n[[Category:Animal physiology]]\n[[Category:Eye]]\n[[Category:Vision]]\n", "name_user": "Atakdoug", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExperimental evidence:copyedit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(eye)"}

The neighbourhood rose to prominence after the erection of Ram Swarup Clock Tower on the [[Grand Trunk Road]] in 1941, and the construction of Jaipuria and Birla [[textile mills]]. It was also a stop on the erstwhile Delhi Tram Service. In the 1950s, it was developed as an affluent residential area.\n\nKamla Nagar, and its adjoining neighbourhoods, were a centre of political activity during the late [[British Raj]] and the first two decades after [[Independence]]. Freedom fighters and political personalities like [[Aruna Asaf Ali]], [[Guru Radha Kishan]], [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], General Secretary [[Kanwar Lal Gupta]], Purshottam Goyal, Murari Lal Gupta Chharia, Baba Ram Swaroop and [[Shiv Charan Gupta|Shivcharan Gupta]] were active there.<ref name=sharma2012>{{Cite web|url=http://next.upi.com/archive/2012/05/03/The-World-rests-here/3801336049535/|author=Shweta Sharma |title=The World rests here |date=3 May 2012 |website=next.upi.com |language=en|access-date=2017-11-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107171756/http://next.upi.com/archive/2012/05/03/The-World-rests-here/3801336049535/ |archivedate=2014-01-07}}</ref>\n\nIt was also a cultural hub after Independence with [[Gulzar]], Santosh Anand and [[Manoj Kumar]] being active there during some part of their lives before becoming popular in Bollywood. Wrestlers like [[Dara Singh]], [[Guru Hanuman]], [[Satpal Singh]], Bhupendra Dhawan and [[Maha Singh Rao]] trained in the ''[[Akhara|akharas]]'' of the area.\n\nKamla Nagar was the venue of Guru Radha Kishan's 24-day fast to support the rights of [[labour unions]] of the textile mills.

The Grand Trunk Road separates Kamla Nagar from [[Shakti_Nagar,_Delhi|Shakti Nagar]]. \n\nKamla Nagar shares much of its character and history with the adjoining neighbourhoods of Shakti Nagar, Roop Nagar, and Malka Ganj. It was built as a residential colony in the 1950s, divided into six blocks with three roundabouts, and contains a mix of apartment buildings and bungalows. Kamla Nagar was developed and sold by [[DLF (company)|DLF]], a company of Ch. Raghubir Singh.\n\n== Shopping hub of Delhi ==\nAlthough originally built as a residential colony, the neighborhood has transformed into a major commercial center of Delhi, and one of the most prominent in North Delhi.<ref name=sharma2012 /> The commercial streets house a mix of international brands and Indian stores, mostly located on and around Bungalow Road, opposite [[Hansraj_College|Hans Raj College]]. The retail stores and restaurants are located on lower floors of the market while the upper stories have remained residential.<ref name=tourism />\n\nIndian [[Street food|street-food]] stands, Chinese fast-food stands and street-side apparel shops are also characteristic of these commercial streets. In addition, the neighborhood includes chain restaurants such as [[McDonald's]], [[Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day|Cafe Coffee Day]], and [[Domino's Pizza|Domino's]].<ref name=tourism>{{Cite web|url=http://www.delhitourism.gov.in/delhitourism/shopping/kamla_nagar.jsp|title=Kamla Nagar |website=www.delhitourism.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, Kamla Nagar has been converting into a ladies' high-street shopping center where one can find western and ethnic clothing, along with cheaper street-bargain shopping. During the sale periods of July\u2013August and February\u2013March, people come to the market for all types of apparel shopping. There are various footwear stores which have opened in the recent times.\n\n==Places of interest== \nThe 17th century [[Roshanara Bagh|Roshanara Garden]] and the adjacent 19th-century Roshanara Club are located in Shakti Nagar. Kamla Nehru Ridge Forest, which lies to the east of Kamla Nagar, contains historic monuments such as the [[Mutiny Memorial]], [[Flagstaff Tower]] and one of the several [[Pillars of Ashoka|Ashoka Pillars]].

It is one of [[Delhi]]'s major shopping centres.\n\n==History==\nKamla Nagar is named after [[Kamala Nehru]], a freedom fighter and wife of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first [[Prime_minister|prime minister]]. The neighbourhood rose to prominence after the erection of Ram Swarup Clock Tower on the [[Grand Trunk Road]] in 1941, and the construction of Jaipuria and Birla [[textile mills]]. It was also a stop on the erstwhile Delhi Tram Service. In the 1950s, it was developed as an affluent residential area.\n\nKamla Nagar, and its adjoining neighbourhoods, were a centre of political activity during the late [[British Raj]] and the first two decades after [[Independence]]. Freedom fighters and political personalities like [[Aruna Asaf Ali]], [[Guru Radha Kishan]], [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], General Secretary [[Kanwar Lal Gupta]], Purshottam Goyal, Murari Lal Gupta Chharia, Baba Ram Swaroop and [[Shiv Charan Gupta|Shivcharan Gupta]] were active there.<ref name=sharma2012>{{Cite web|url=http://next.upi.com/archive/2012/05/03/The-World-rests-here/3801336049535/|author=Shweta Sharma |title=The World rests here |date=3 May 2012 |website=next.upi.com |language=en|access-date=2017-11-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107171756/http://next.upi.com/archive/2012/05/03/The-World-rests-here/3801336049535/ |archivedate=2014-01-07}}</ref>\n\nIt was also a cultural hub after Independence with [[Gulzar]], Santosh Anand and [[Manoj Kumar]] being active there during some part of their lives before becoming popular in Bollywood. Wrestlers like [[Dara Singh]], [[Guru Hanuman]], [[Satpal Singh]], Bhupendra Dhawan and [[Maha Singh Rao]] trained in the ''[[Akhara|akharas]]'' of the area.\n\nKamla Nagar was the venue of Guru Radha Kishan's 24-day fast to support the rights of [[labour unions]] of the textile mills. Kishan was elected the youngest member of the Delhi Municipal Committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mana Constituency|url=http://www.manaconstituency.com/Party_page/cpi.html|website=www.manaconstituency.com|accessdate=9 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107174010/http://www.manaconstituency.com/Party_page/cpi.html|archivedate=2014-01-07}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nKamla Nagar is surrounded by New Chandrawal Village, [[University of Delhi|University of Delhi's]] north campus and Kamla Nehru Ridge Forest on the east, [[Roop Nagar]] on the north, [[Shakti Nagar, Delhi|Shakti Nagar]] on the west and Malka Ganj on the south. The Grand Trunk Road separates Kamla Nagar from [[Shakti_Nagar,_Delhi|Shakti Nagar]]. \n\nKamla Nagar shares much of its character and history with the adjoining neighbourhoods of Shakti Nagar, Roop Nagar, and Malka Ganj. It was built as a residential colony in the 1950s, divided into six blocks with three roundabouts, and contains a mix of apartment buildings and bungalows. Kamla Nagar was developed and sold by [[DLF (company)|DLF]], a company of Ch. Raghubir Singh.\n\n== Shopping hub of Delhi ==\nAlthough originally built as a residential colony, the neighborhood has transformed into a major commercial centre of Delhi, and one of the most prominent in North Delhi.<ref name=sharma2012 /> The commercial streets house a mix of international brands and Indian stores, mostly located on and around Bungalow Road, opposite [[Hansraj_College|Hans Raj College]]. The retail stores and restaurants are located on lower floors of the market while the upper stories have remained residential.<ref name=tourism />\n\nIndian [[Street food|street-food]] stands, Chinese fast-food stands and street-side apparel shops are also characteristic of these commercial streets. In addition, the neighborhood includes chain restaurants such as [[McDonald's]], [[Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day|Cafe Coffee Day]], and [[Domino's Pizza|Domino's]].<ref name=tourism>{{Cite web|url=http://www.delhitourism.gov.in/delhitourism/shopping/kamla_nagar.jsp|title=Kamla Nagar |website=www.delhitourism.gov.in|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, Kamla Nagar has been converting into a ladies' high-street shopping center where one can find western and ethnic clothing, along with cheaper street-bargain shopping. During the sale periods of July\u2013August and February\u2013March, people come to the market for all types of apparel shopping. There are various footwear stores which have opened in the recent times.\n\n==Places of interest== \nThe 17th century [[Roshanara Bagh|Roshanara Garden]] and the adjacent 19th-century Roshanara Club are located in Shakti Nagar.
