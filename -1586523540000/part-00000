Adult [[rat snake]]s and [[ball python]]s, for example, are fed a diet of mostly rats in captivity. Rats are readily available (live or frozen) to individual snake owners, as well as to pet shops and reptile zoos, from many suppliers. In Britain, the government prohibited the feeding of any live mammal to another animal in 2007.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The rule says the animal must be dead before it is given to the animal to eat.

[[Islamic dietary laws|Islam]] and [[Kashrut]] traditions prohibit it, while both the [[Shipibo people]] of Peru and [[Sirion\u00f3 people]] of Bolivia have cultural taboos against the eating of rats.<ref>Behrens, Clifford A.

When feasting, the Polynesian people of [[Rapa Nui]] could eat rat meat, but the king was not allowed to, due to the islanders' belief in his \"state of sacredness\" called [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|''tapu'']].<ref>Leach, Helen.

World Archaeology, Vol. 34, No. 3, Luxury Foods. pp. 442\u2013457.</ref> In studying precontact archaeological sites in [[Hawaii]], archaeologists have found the concentration of the remains of rats associated with commoner households accounted for three times the animal remains associated with elite households. The rat bones found in all sites are fragmented, burned and covered in carbonized material, indicating the rats were eaten as food. The greater occurrence of rat remains associated with commoner households may indicate the elites of precontact Hawaii did not consume them as a matter of status or taste.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kirch | first1 = Patrick V. | last2 = Sharyn Jones | first2 = O'Day | year = 2003 | title = New Archaeological Insights into Food and Status: A Case Study from Pre-Contact Hawaii. | url = | journal = World Archaeology | volume = 34 | issue = 3| pages = 484\u2013497 | doi=10.1080/0043824021000026468}}</ref>\n\n==As food for pets==\nRats are a common food item for [[snakes]], both in the wild, and as pets. Adult [[rat snake]]s and [[ball python]]s, for example, are fed a diet of mostly rats in captivity. Rats are readily available (live or frozen) to individual snake owners, as well as to pet shops and reptile zoos, from many suppliers. In Britain, the government prohibited the feeding of any live mammal to another animal in 2007.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The rule says the animal must be dead before it is given to the animal to eat. The rule was put into place mainly because of the pressure of the [[RSPCA]] and people who said the feeding of live animals was cruel.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of meat dishes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Meat|state=expanded}}\n\n{{Commonscat}}\n\n[[Category:Meat by animal]]\n[[Category:Rats]]\n[[Category:Meat dishes]]\n", "name_user": "212.237.134.7", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eEurope)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_meat"}

After the [[migration of peoples]] of the late antiquity tribes also dominated areas on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], so the [[Kingdom of the Suevi]] (from 409) and the [[Visigothic kingdom]] (beginning with the second half of the 5th century). From 711, much of Spain came under [[History of Spain#Islamic Empires (711-1492)|Muslim Rule]]. Only [[Karl Martell]], king of the [[Frankish Empire]], which at that time included common French and German territories, was able to expand the [Moorish] advancing from Spain to south-west France through the [[Battle of Tours and Poitiers]]. Only in the north of the Iberian peninsula were Christian empires able to assert themselves. From there began from 722 until 1492 continuing Spanish [[Reconquista]].\n\n=== Alfons X. ===\n[[File: Libro de los Juegos, Alfonso X y su corte.jpg | thumb|right | Alfonso X of Castile (Illustration from the '' Libro de los juegos '', 1251-1282)]]\nAlso [[Alfonso X. (Castile)|Alfonso X.]], King of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] and [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] from 1252 to 1282, led a crusade against the [[Moors]].\n\nThis ruler was from 1257 to 1273 also [[Roman-German King|King]] [[Counter-King]] of [[Holy Roman Empire]], which was related to his mother:\nHis descent from the German family of [[Hohenstaufen Hohenstaufen]] through his mother Elisabeth, a daughter of the king [[Philipp von Schwaben]], gave him the right to represent the [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabian]] line. The election of [[Prince-elector|Elector]] in 1257, after the death of [[William II, Count of Holland|William of Holland]] in 1256, in which he received the same number of votes (both three votes) as the opponent [[Richard of Cornwall]], seduced him to aim for the prestigious [[Kaiser]] crown through the Roman-German kingship; However, this was never realized, because he could not raise the necessary money for a [[Romzug]]. In order to get money, he worsened the coins and then tried to control the price increase by an idiosyncratic tax system. The retail trade in its territory was ruined, and the citizens and peasants were badly damaged. The unanimous election [[Rudolf I. (HRR)|Rudolf I of Habsburg]] to the Roman-German King in 1273 actually meant Alfons' deposition as king of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\n=== Karl V .: \"In my kingdom the sun never sets\" ===\n[[File: Empire-Roman-Emperor-Charles-V.jpg |thumb|right| Reign of Charles V. <br />\n'' 'Burgundy:' '' Castile <br />\n'' 'Red:' 'Aragon's possessions <br />\n'' 'Orange:' '' Burgundian possessions <br />\n'' 'Yellow:' '' Austrian hereditary land <br />\n'' 'Pale yellow:' '' Holy Roman Empire]]\nThe Reconquista was completed by the [[Catholic Kings]] Queen [[Isabella I (Castile)|Isabella I]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and King [[Ferdinand II. (Arag\u00f3n)|Ferdinand II.]] Of [[Crown Aragon|Arag\u00f3n]] in 1492. In the same year, the Spanish sailor [[Christopher Columbus]] discovered America and laid the foundation stone for the [[Spanish Colonial Empire|Spanish Empire]]. The heir of Isabella, who died in 1504, was her son [[John of Arag\u00f3n and Castile|Juan]]. He married Margaret of Burgundy in 1496, the daughter of the later Roman-German Emperor [[Maximilian I. (HRR)|Maximilian I]], but died in 1497 without heirs. The younger sister Johanna married in 1497 the Habsburg [[Philip I (Castile)|Philipp the beautiful]] (1478-1506), who was also a son of Maximilian, also Duke of Burgundy. However, after showing signs of \"madness\" in the eyes of his contemporaries, Ferdinand took over. With the death of Ferdinand, the eldest son of Johanna's marriage [[Charles V (HRR)|Charles]] fell to the Spanish heritage.\n\n[[File: Peter Paul Rubens 119.jpg | thumb| Emperor [[Karl V. (HRR)|Charles V]] ruled over a '' global empire '' in which '' the sun never went down '' ' ; Painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]]]\nTo secure the heritage, Charles concluded the [[Treaty of Noyon]] in 1516 for understanding with France.<ref>Alfred Kohler: ''Charles V (1519-1556).'' In: ''The emperors of modern times.'' Munich 1990, p. 35.</ref> In 1519, after his grandfather Maximilian had died, he was also struck by the Austrian - [[habsburg]] inheritance. He was elected [[Roman-German King]] and assumed the title \"Chosen Emperor\" at his coronation in 1520.\nFrancis I of France and [[Henry VIII (England)|Henry VIII of England]] also applied for Maximilian's succession, and finally [[Frederick III. (Saxony)|Friedrich von Sachsen]], and Karl's brother Ferdinand was at times as a candidate in the conversation. The decisive factor was the financial support provided by the [[Fugger]]. The total cost of the election was 851,918 guilders, of which the Fuggers alone raised 543,585.<ref>Michael North: \"The money and its history. From the Middle Ages to the present day. ''Beck, Munich 1994, p. 86.''</ref> \nIn Spain, the [[Comuneros Uprising]] broke out against the reign of Karl, a foreigner, who had raised taxes to finance his wars. The insurrection was mainly supported by the bourgeoisie of the cities of Castile, in particular [Toledo]. He found support in parts of the clergy and the nobility. His goal was to limit the royal power in favor of Cortes. In the [[Kingdom of Valencia]] he came to a social revolutionary movement, the [[Germania]]. The rebels under [[Juan de Padilla (Insurgent)|Juan de Padilla]] were defeated at Villalar in 1521, the rebellion finally suppressed in 1522. After securing power, Spain became a central power base of the emperor.\n\n=== Wars with France and the Ottomans (1521-1556) ===\nAt European level, the fighting between France and the Habsburgs was of great importance. For the Emperor it was dangerous, as the Pope and Venice tended increasingly to the side of France. In 1525 Charles' troops captured Francis I in the Battle of Pavia (1525).<ref>Horst Rabe: ''Reich und Glaubens- schaltung. Germany 1500-1600.'' Munich 1989, p. 152.</ref> But Karl joined the proposals for a moderate peace.<ref>Alfred Kohler: ''Charles V, Emperor.'' In: ''Neue Deutsche Biographie.'' 11 (1977), p. 196; [http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd118560093.html online].</ref> This led to the signing of the [[Peace of Madrid|Treaty of Madrid]] in 1526, in which France relinquished its claims in northern Italy , Karl hoped to be able to persuade Franz to fight together against the Ottomans and against the Lutherans.<ref>Horst Rabe: ''Reich und Glaubens- schaltung. Germany 1500-1600.'' Munich 1989, p. 153.</ref> But after Franz was released, he revoked the contract. He managed to win with the Holy League of Cognac from the Pope, Venice, Florence and finally even Milan allies.\n\n=== Division of the Habsburg Empire, Philip II (1556-1598) ===\n[[File: Barbara Blomberg.jpg |thumb|Barbara Blomberg with Emperor Charles V (wood engraving from 1894)]]\nWhen Charles V put down the government in 1556, Spain lost the Austrian possessions of the House of Habsburg and the imperial crown, but retained the Netherlands, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, the Duchy of Milan, and the kingdoms. [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]].\nIn 1570 his son and successor married [[Philip II (Spain)|Philip II]] [[Anna of Austria (1549-1580)]], the mother of the heir apparent [[Philipp III. (Spain)|Philipp]].\n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] was an expansive major power. Venice and Spain sent a common fleet into the eastern Mediterranean, which defeated the Turks in the [[Battle of Lepanto]] on 7 October 1571. Although [[Holy Roman Empire | Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]] was not part of the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]], its Commander-in-Chief [[Juan de Austria]], an extra-marital son of Emperor [[Karl V. (HRR)|Charles V.]] and the bourgeois [[Regensburg]] he [[G\u00fcrtler]] s daughter [[Barbara Blomberg]].\n\n=== Spanish Succession War (1701-1714) ===\nThe extinction of the Spanish Habsburgs in 1701 triggered the [[Spanish War of Succession|Spanish Succession War]]. The [[Hague Great Alliance]] around the [[History of Austria|Austrian]] - [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] [[Roman-German Emperor|Emperor]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the [[Republic of the Seven United Provinces|Netherlands]] fought against [[Kingdom of France (987-1791)|France]] and its allies [[Kurk\u00f6ln]], [[House Savoyen|Savoy]] and the [[Electorate of Bavaria]].<ref>The Duchy of Savoy was part of the Bourbon Alliance until November 8, 1703, but then switched sides and joined the [[Hague Great Alliance|Hague Grand Alliance]]and thus the Habsburgs.</ref> The war took an unfavorable turn for Habsburg with the death of [[Joseph I. (HRR)|Joseph I.]], but it also shook the forces of France. The Austrian house Habsburg had become under Leopold I. and Joseph I. nevertheless to the European great power.\nIn the end, France succeeded in establishing [[Philipp V. (Spain)|Philip V]] as king of Spain. Thus the dynasty of the [[House Bourbon|Bourbonen]], which reigns today, was founded in Spain. Almost all the powers involved in the war had achieved at least partial successes at the end of the war.\n\n=== 19th century ===\nLeopold von Hohenzollern: Spanish succession disputes lead to the [[Franco-Prussian War]].\nIn 1869, the Spanish [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] proclaimed a new constitution that envisaged a parliamentary monarchy as a form of government. A promising royal candidate was [[Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], scion of a Catholic branch line of [[Hohenzollern]]. He was persuaded in the spring of 1870 by [[Otto von Bismarck]] to accept the candidature. Soon Leopold resigned from his candidacy, as France threatened war. The French objection to Leopold or the French demand \"that S. Maj. The [Prussian] king committed himself for all future, never to give his consent again, if the Hohenzollern should come back to their candidature\" - as that of Otto edited by Bismarck and thus deliberately pointed [[Emser Depesche]], led to the [[Franco-Prussian War|German-French War]]. The victory of Prussia and its allies resulted in 1871 in the [[German Unification]]. While [[Reich Chancellor]] Bismarck described the German Reich as \"saturated\" in order to be able to insert the new power factor in Europe's center into the Concert of the Powers, Kaiser [[Wilhelm II. (German Reich)]] demanded (Kaiser from 1888) later \"a place in the sun\" for the Germans. As part of its world power policy, Germany also came into conflict with Spain, even though it had already lost most of its colonies anyway.\nThe [[Spanish-Spanish Treaty of 1899|1899]] forced Spain to relinquish the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], the northern [[Mariana Islands]] and [[Palau]] to Germany. The [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] areas in [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] then formed part of [[New Guinea]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|Ruins left by the [[bombing of Guernica]] in 1937, the 'Operation R\u00fcgen'.]]\nIn [[World War I]] (1914-1918), Spain remained neutral, while Germany and the other [[Central Powers]] lost the war against the [[Triple Entente]]. This led to the abdication of all German monarchs.\nA side effect of the German defeat was that Germany failed as a rival of Spain in the struggle for colonial possessions in Morocco. The brothers [[Mannesmann]] had possession in the [[Rif|Moroccan Rif area]], which corresponded to about one-eighth of the territory.\nIn the [[Rifkrieg (1921-1926)]] the Spaniards tried to extend their rule to the entire colonial territory in northern Morocco. It was at the initiative of the king who wanted to exterminate the Rif Kabyles, Dirk Sasse: French, British and Germans in the Rifkrieg 1921-1926. Speculators and sympathizers, deserters and gamblers in the service Abdelkrims.<ref>''Dissertation.

Democratic ideas were threatened on the right by [[fascism|fascist]] and on the left by [[communist]] ideologies. While in the [[Versailles Treaty]] hard-hit Germany, the [[Weimar Republic]] fought for its consolidation, it came in Spain to dictatorship under General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] (1923-1930) and 1931 to proclaim the [[Second Spanish Republic]].\n\nAfter the July 1936 semi-failed coup d'etat in Spain that led to the start of the 1936\u201339 [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], Nazi Germany (along Fascist Italy) sided with the rebels and supplied them with money, munitions and manpower, including the intervention of the [[Condor Legion]].\n\n{{Main|German involvement in the Spanish Civil War}}\n\n=== Germans on the Republican side ===\n[[International Militia]], including Germans, fought against Franco's forces.

Famous personalities like [[George Orwell]] and the later Social Democrat Member of Parliament [[Peter Blachstein]] fought in the POUM militia units.\nIn the [[massacre of M\u00e1laga]] on the fleeing population of the city in February 1937 about 10,000 people were murdered. In the concentration camps, medical experiments were also carried out on the prisoners with National Socialist support.<ref>Javier Bandr\u00e9s, Rafael Llavona: ''La psicolog\u00eda en los campos de concentraci\u00f3n de Franco.''

More than half returned to Spain in the next few months. In France remained about 150,000, many of them were sent as prisoners of war in different [[main camp]] and since August 6, 1940 in the [[concentration camp Mauthausen]]. More than 7,000 Spanish prisoners lived there, 5,000 of whom died. Some Spaniards were extradited to Franco by the [[Geheime Staatspolizei|Gestapo]], others, such as the former head of government [[Francisco Largo Caballero]], were deported to various German concentration camps. When the last Republican forces had given up, Franco proclaimed victory on April 1, 1939, the [Francoist Francoist] dictatorship prevailed throughout Spain.\n\n=== Non-belligerent during World War II ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L15327, Spanien, Heinrich Himmler bei Franco.jpg |thumb| [[Reichsf\u00fchrer SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] with [[Karl Wolff (SS member)|Karl Wolff]] at one Meeting with Franco in Spain, October 25, 1940]]\nAlthough Franco unquestionably had sympathy for the fascist regime in Italy and for the National Socialist regime in Germany, remained in practice, the solidarity with his alleged ideological allies within limits. He was more likely to associate business relations with these regimes than an ideological community of fate. Spain joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] in March 1939. Franco declared in July 1940 that his country was not neutral but merely a war leader and stated to Hitler in a letter dated February 1941, \"that we three men, the Duce, you and me, by the hardest compulsion of the <ref>Bernd Rill, in: ''Geschichte'' 2/2001, p. 36.</ref> Characteristic of Franco 's attitude to the [[Axis powers|Axis]] n, however, is his behavior in [[Hendaye]] in 1940 (thus at the height of Nazi power in Europe) on the occasion of his only meeting with Hitler, when Franco not only demanded French colonial territory for Spain's entry into the war, but also refused to allow German troops into his country to let. According to his own statements, Franco is said to have even told Hitler that Spain will fight every invader to the last man, wherever he comes from. In addition, Franco demanded the supply of raw materials such as [[cotton]] and [[rubber]], which Germany could hardly deliver. Franco, in spite of his superficial approval, finally closed Hitler's suggestion to occupy Gibraltar, which had long been demanded by England, because that would have meant Franco's entry into the Second World War.<ref>Compare {{Web Archive|text=yale.edu|url=http: //www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/spain/sp06.htm|wayback=20160820123921|archiv-bot=2018-04- 06 06:13:33 InternetArchiveBot}}and {{Web Archive | text = yale.edu | url = http: //www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/spain/sp07.htm | wayback = 20160820123931 | archiv- bot = 2018-04-06 06:13:33 InternetArchiveBot}}</ref> His condolences finally consisted in sending the '[[Blue Division|Divisi\u00f3n Azul]]' 'to the Eastern Front, 47,000 Falangist volunteers under General [[Agust\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz Grandes]], but which he withdrew in 1943 after the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] there again.

In 1943, this idea became common knowledge, so that by the time the Second World War came to a close, Spain was well advanced on the path of transition from a partially mobilized, semi-fascist state to a Catholic, corporate and increasingly demobilized authoritarian regime.<ref>Stanley Payne: ''History of fascism.

P. 325</ref>\"When Franco's defeat loomed around 1943, Franco withdrew from the Axis powers. He declared Spain neutral this year and, in exchange for allied oil supplies, largely cushioned Germany's material and non-material support. He also dismissed the sympathetic members of his government, including his brother-in-law [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er]]. This shift allowed Franco to appease the Allies. In addition, during the Second World War, the abolition of external symbols such as the Fascist salute came. For Franco, Hitler and Mussolini were only interesting as long as they were powerful and he had something to expect from them. Another aspect, however, is that Spain, still severely weakened by the recent civil war, could not afford to participate in another [[military|gun]] campaign.\n\nAfter the war, Spain was stationed on one of the so-called [[rat lines]], the escape routes of the dignitaries of both the Nazi regime itself and its ideological allies - often for the purpose of traveling to [[South America]]. Some of them also found refuge in Spain itself, such as [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]], leader of the Belgian [[Rexists]].\n\n=== postwar ===\nAfter the Second World War, the occupied and divided Germany initially fell out as a player on the international stage. After the victory of the Western democracies, the Spanish dictatorship was naturally isolated, which should, however, be defused by the looming [[Cold War]] for Franco.\n\nIn 1955, Spain was admitted to the United Nations. In 1973, the German Democratic Republic followed as the 133rd and the Federal Republic of Germany as the 134th member. From the beginning of the 1960s, Franco sought an [association] agreement with the [[European Community|EC]]. He submitted an application on February 9, 1962. It was only in 1966 that negotiations began, which were delayed until the conclusion of a first agreement in 1970, mainly due to political reservations of the then six states (including the FRG).\n\n=== After the end of the Spanish dictatorship ===\n[[File: Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez se entrevista con el canciller de Alemania.jpg | thumb|upright = 1.5 | Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez and Helmut Kohl (1993)]]\nThe Spanish isolation could only be completely broken after Franco's death in 1975 and the subsequent democratization under King [[Juan Carlos I]].\n\nSpain joined the [[NATO]] in 1982; The Federal Republic of Germany belonged to the Atlantic Pact since 1955. In 1986 Spain became a member of the European Community and in 1988 the Western European Union. Spain also decided to use the [[Euro]] as the currency together with Germany and other European partners (1999 as book money, cash introduction 2002), so that no currency exchange between the two countries is necessary.\n\n===21st Century===\nIn [[Iraq war]] in 2003, Spain joined the US despite the popular opposition of the \"[Coalition of the Willing One]\". Germany, together with Russia and France, refused to participate in the war on [[Saddam Hussein]] s. Foreign policy, however, Spain then approached again to Germany and France. Prime Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero|Zapatero]] withdrew the troops from Iraq by July 2004, but he soon added to the military contingent in [[Afghanistan]] in view of the relations with the US damaged by the withdrawal until November 2013 34 Spaniards died.<ref>{{Web Archive|url=http: //www.icasualties.org/oef/Nationality.aspx? hndQry = Spain|wayback=20150629014922|text=Operation Enduring Freedom, Coalition Deaths by Nationality}} Germany and Spain jointly participated in the Security and Reconstruction Mission under [NATO] International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).</ref>\n\n=== Current status ===\nThe relations between the [[Federal Government (Germany)|German Federal Government]] and the Government of Spain are unencumbered.

After the [[migration of peoples]] of the late antiquity tribes also dominated areas on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], so the [[Kingdom of the Suevi]] (from 409) and the [[Visigothic kingdom]] (beginning with the second half of the 5th century). From 711, much of Spain came under [[History of Spain#Islamic Empires (711-1492)|Muslim Rule]]. Only [[Karl Martell]], king of the [[Frankish Empire]], which at that time included common French and German territories, was able to expand the [Moorish] advancing from Spain to south-west France through the [[Battle of Tours and Poitiers]]. Only in the north of the Iberian peninsula were Christian empires able to assert themselves. From there began from 722 until 1492 continuing Spanish [[Reconquista]].\n\n=== Alfons X. ===\n[[File: Libro de los Juegos, Alfonso X y su corte.jpg | thumb|right | Alfonso X of Castile (Illustration from the '' Libro de los juegos '', 1251-1282)]]\nAlso [[Alfonso X.

The election of [[Prince-elector|Elector]] in 1257, after the death of [[William II, Count of Holland|William of Holland]] in 1256, in which he received the same number of votes (both three votes) as the opponent [[Richard of Cornwall]], seduced him to aim for the prestigious [[Kaiser]] crown through the Roman-German kingship; However, this was never realized, because he could not raise the necessary money for a [[Romzug]]. In order to get money, he worsened the coins and then tried to control the price increase by an idiosyncratic tax system. The retail trade in its territory was ruined, and the citizens and peasants were badly damaged. The unanimous election [[Rudolf I. (HRR)|Rudolf I of Habsburg]] to the Roman-German King in 1273 actually meant Alfons' deposition as king of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\n=== Karl V .: \"In my kingdom the sun never sets\" ===\n[[File: Empire-Roman-Emperor-Charles-V.jpg |thumb|right| Reign of Charles V. <br />\n'' 'Burgundy:' '' Castile <br />\n'' 'Red:' 'Aragon's possessions <br />\n'' 'Orange:' '' Burgundian possessions <br />\n'' 'Yellow:' '' Austrian hereditary land <br />\n'' 'Pale yellow:' '' Holy Roman Empire]]\nThe Reconquista was completed by the [[Catholic Kings]] Queen [[Isabella I (Castile)|Isabella I]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and King [[Ferdinand II.

In the same year, the Spanish sailor [[Christopher Columbus]] discovered America and laid the foundation stone for the [[Spanish Colonial Empire|Spanish Empire]]. The heir of Isabella, who died in 1504, was her son [[John of Arag\u00f3n and Castile|Juan]]. He married Margaret of Burgundy in 1496, the daughter of the later Roman-German Emperor [[Maximilian I. (HRR)|Maximilian I]], but died in 1497 without heirs. The younger sister Johanna married in 1497 the Habsburg [[Philip I (Castile)|Philipp the beautiful]] (1478-1506), who was also a son of Maximilian, also Duke of Burgundy. However, after showing signs of \"madness\" in the eyes of his contemporaries, Ferdinand took over. With the death of Ferdinand, the eldest son of Johanna's marriage [[Charles V (HRR)|Charles]] fell to the Spanish heritage.\n\n[[File: Peter Paul Rubens 119.jpg | thumb| Emperor [[Karl V.

The insurrection was mainly supported by the bourgeoisie of the cities of Castile, in particular [Toledo]. He found support in parts of the clergy and the nobility. His goal was to limit the royal power in favor of Cortes. In the [[Kingdom of Valencia]] he came to a social revolutionary movement, the [[Germania]]. The rebels under [[Juan de Padilla (Insurgent)|Juan de Padilla]] were defeated at Villalar in 1521, the rebellion finally suppressed in 1522. After securing power, Spain became a central power base of the emperor.\n\n=== Wars with France and the Ottomans (1521-1556) ===\nAt European level, the fighting between France and the Habsburgs was of great importance. For the Emperor it was dangerous, as the Pope and Venice tended increasingly to the side of France. In 1525 Charles' troops captured Francis I in the Battle of Pavia (1525).<ref>Horst Rabe: ''Reich und Glaubens- schaltung. Germany 1500-1600.''

Germany 1500-1600.'' Munich 1989, p. 153.</ref> But after Franz was released, he revoked the contract. He managed to win with the Holy League of Cognac from the Pope, Venice, Florence and finally even Milan allies.\n\n=== Division of the Habsburg Empire, Philip II (1556-1598) ===\n[[File: Barbara Blomberg.jpg |thumb|Barbara Blomberg with Emperor Charles V (wood engraving from 1894)]]\nWhen Charles V put down the government in 1556, Spain lost the Austrian possessions of the House of Habsburg and the imperial crown, but retained the Netherlands, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, the Duchy of Milan, and the kingdoms. [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]].\nIn 1570 his son and successor married [[Philip II (Spain)|Philip II]] [[Anna of Austria (1549-1580)]], the mother of the heir apparent [[Philipp III. (Spain)|Philipp]].\n\nIn the 16th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] was an expansive major power. Venice and Spain sent a common fleet into the eastern Mediterranean, which defeated the Turks in the [[Battle of Lepanto]] on 7 October 1571. Although [[Holy Roman Empire | Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]] was not part of the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]], its Commander-in-Chief [[Juan de Austria]], an extra-marital son of Emperor [[Karl V. (HRR)|Charles V.]] and the bourgeois [[Regensburg]] he [[G\u00fcrtler]] s daughter [[Barbara Blomberg]].\n\n=== Spanish Succession War (1701-1714) ===\nThe extinction of the Spanish Habsburgs in 1701 triggered the [[Spanish War of Succession|Spanish Succession War]]. The [[Hague Great Alliance]] around the [[History of Austria|Austrian]] - [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] [[Roman-German Emperor|Emperor]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the [[Republic of the Seven United Provinces|Netherlands]] fought against [[Kingdom of France (987-1791)|France]] and its allies [[Kurk\u00f6ln]], [[House Savoyen|Savoy]] and the [[Electorate of Bavaria]].<ref>The Duchy of Savoy was part of the Bourbon Alliance until November 8, 1703, but then switched sides and joined the [[Hague Great Alliance|Hague Grand Alliance]]and thus the Habsburgs.</ref> The war took an unfavorable turn for Habsburg with the death of [[Joseph I. (HRR)|Joseph I.]], but it also shook the forces of France. The Austrian house Habsburg had become under Leopold I. and Joseph I. nevertheless to the European great power.\nIn the end, France succeeded in establishing [[Philipp V. (Spain)|Philip V]] as king of Spain. Thus the dynasty of the [[House Bourbon|Bourbonen]], which reigns today, was founded in Spain. Almost all the powers involved in the war had achieved at least partial successes at the end of the war.\n\n=== 19th century ===\nLeopold von Hohenzollern: Spanish succession disputes lead to the [[Franco-Prussian War]].\nIn 1869, the Spanish [[Cortes]]{{disambiguation needed|date=August 2019}} proclaimed a new constitution that envisaged a parliamentary monarchy as a form of government. A promising royal candidate was [[Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], scion of a Catholic branch line of [[Hohenzollern]]. He was persuaded in the spring of 1870 by [[Otto von Bismarck]] to accept the candidature. Soon Leopold resigned from his candidacy, as France threatened war. The French objection to Leopold or the French demand \"that S. Maj. The [Prussian] king committed himself for all future, never to give his consent again, if the Hohenzollern should come back to their candidature\" - as that of Otto edited by Bismarck and thus deliberately pointed [[Emser Depesche]], led to the [[Franco-Prussian War|German-French War]]. The victory of Prussia and its allies resulted in 1871 in the [[German Unification]]. While [[Reich Chancellor]] Bismarck described the German Reich as \"saturated\" in order to be able to insert the new power factor in Europe's center into the Concert of the Powers, Kaiser [[Wilhelm II. (German Reich)]] demanded (Kaiser from 1888) later \"a place in the sun\" for the Germans. As part of its world power policy, Germany also came into conflict with Spain, even though it had already lost most of its colonies anyway.\nThe [[Spanish-Spanish Treaty of 1899|1899]] forced Spain to relinquish the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], the northern [[Mariana Islands]] and [[Palau]] to Germany. The [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] areas in [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] then formed part of [[New Guinea]].\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|Ruins left by the [[bombing of Guernica]] in 1937, the 'Operation R\u00fcgen'.]]\nIn [[World War I]] (1914-1918), Spain remained neutral, while Germany and the other [[Central Powers]] lost the war against the [[Triple Entente]]. This led to the abdication of all German monarchs.\nA side effect of the German defeat was that Germany failed as a rival of Spain in the struggle for colonial possessions in Morocco. The brothers [[Mannesmann]] had possession in the [[Rif|Moroccan Rif area]], which corresponded to about one-eighth of the territory.\nIn the [[Rifkrieg (1921-1926)]] the Spaniards tried to extend their rule to the entire colonial territory in northern Morocco. It was at the initiative of the king who wanted to exterminate the Rif Kabyles, Dirk Sasse: French, British and Germans in the Rifkrieg 1921-1926.

Democratic ideas were threatened on the right by [[fascism|fascist]] and on the left by [[communist]] ideologies. While in the [[Versailles Treaty]] hard-hit Germany, the [[Weimar Republic]] fought for its consolidation, it came in Spain to dictatorship under General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] (1923-1930) and 1931 to proclaim the [[Second Spanish Republic]].\n\nAfter the July 1936 semi-failed coup d'etat in Spain that led to the start of the 1936\u201339 [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], Nazi Germany (along Fascist Italy) sided with the rebels and supplied them with money, munitions and manpower, including the intervention of the [[Condor Legion]].\n\n{{Main|German involvement in the Spanish Civil War}}\n\n=== Germans on the Republican side ===\n[[International Militia]], including Germans, fought against Franco's forces. The [[Edgar-Andr\u00e9-Group|Edgar Andr\u00e9]] and the [[Edgar-Andr\u00e9-Battalion]] or the \"Hans-Bataillon\", the [[Hoffmann-Group]] <br /> came from Germany Group around comrades Hoffmann <ref>[[Hanns Maa\u00dfen]]: ''Brigada Internacional is our honor name ...'' , R\u00f6derberg publishing house GmbH, Frankfurt / Main 1976, {{ISBN|3-87682-515-6}}, page 389</ref> the [[Thaelmann Group]] (group around [[Arthur Pfeiffer]]) and the [[Centuria Th\u00e4lmann]], formed by [[Hans Beimler (communist)|Hans Beimler]], unit in the [[Maxim Gorki]] Battalion, [[Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya|PSUC]] - Division [[Karl Marx|Carlos Marx]](later: | [[Th\u00e4lmann Battalion]] ), see Th\u00e4lmann group and [[Thaelmann column]].<ref>Sebasti\u00e1n Herreros Ag\u00fc\u00ed: [http://www.flaginstitute.org/pdfs/Sebastia%20Herreros.pdf The International Brigades in the Spanish was 1936-1939: Flags and Symbols, Wall and Sch\u00fctzenzeitung of October 15, 1936](English; PDF, 6.4 MB), retrieved on September 3, 2012</ref>\n\nMembers of the international POUM militia also fought for members of [[Trotskyist]], [[left-socialist]] and opposition communist groups such as the German [[Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands (1931)|SAP]] and [[Communist Party Opposition|KPO]]. Famous personalities like [[George Orwell]] and the later Social Democrat Member of Parliament [[Peter Blachstein]] fought in the POUM militia units.\nIn the [[massacre of M\u00e1laga]] on the fleeing population of the city in February 1937 about 10,000 people were murdered. In the concentration camps, medical experiments were also carried out on the prisoners with National Socialist support.<ref>Javier Bandr\u00e9s, Rafael Llavona: ''La psicolog\u00eda en los campos de concentraci\u00f3n de Franco.''

More than half returned to Spain in the next few months. In France remained about 150,000, many of them were sent as prisoners of war in different [[main camp]] and since August 6, 1940 in the [[concentration camp Mauthausen]]. More than 7,000 Spanish prisoners lived there, 5,000 of whom died. Some Spaniards were extradited to Franco by the [[Geheime Staatspolizei|Gestapo]], others, such as the former head of government [[Francisco Largo Caballero]], were deported to various German concentration camps. When the last Republican forces had given up, Franco proclaimed victory on April 1, 1939, the [Francoist Francoist] dictatorship prevailed throughout Spain.\n\n=== Non-belligerent during World War II ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L15327, Spanien, Heinrich Himmler bei Franco.jpg |thumb| [[Reichsf\u00fchrer SS]] [[Heinrich Himmler]] with [[Karl Wolff (SS member)|Karl Wolff]] at one Meeting with Franco in Spain, October 25, 1940]]\nAlthough Franco unquestionably had sympathy for the fascist regime in Italy and for the National Socialist regime in Germany, remained in practice, the solidarity with his alleged ideological allies within limits. He was more likely to associate business relations with these regimes than an ideological community of fate. Spain joined the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] in March 1939. Franco declared in July 1940 that his country was not neutral but merely a war leader and stated to Hitler in a letter dated February 1941, \"that we three men, the Duce, you and me, by the hardest compulsion of the <ref>Bernd Rill, in: ''Geschichte'' 2/2001, p. 36.</ref> Characteristic of Franco 's attitude to the [[Axis powers|Axis]] n, however, is his behavior in [[Hendaye]] in 1940 (thus at the height of Nazi power in Europe) on the occasion of his only meeting with Hitler, when Franco not only demanded French colonial territory for Spain's entry into the war, but also refused to allow German troops into his country to let. According to his own statements, Franco is said to have even told Hitler that Spain will fight every invader to the last man, wherever he comes from. In addition, Franco demanded the supply of raw materials such as [[cotton]] and [[rubber]], which Germany could hardly deliver. Franco, in spite of his superficial approval, finally closed Hitler's suggestion to occupy Gibraltar, which had long been demanded by England, because that would have meant Franco's entry into the Second World War.<ref>Compare {{Web Archive|text=yale.edu|url=http: //www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/spain/sp06.htm|wayback=20160820123921|archiv-bot=2018-04- 06 06:13:33 InternetArchiveBot}}and {{Web Archive | text = yale.edu | url = http: //www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/wwii/spain/sp07.htm | wayback = 20160820123931 | archiv- bot = 2018-04-06 06:13:33 InternetArchiveBot}}</ref> His condolences finally consisted in sending the '[[Blue Division|Divisi\u00f3n Azul]]' 'to the Eastern Front, 47,000 Falangist volunteers under General [[Agust\u00edn Mu\u00f1oz Grandes]], but which he withdrew in 1943 after the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] there again.

In 1943, this idea became common knowledge, so that by the time the Second World War came to a close, Spain was well advanced on the path of transition from a partially mobilized, semi-fascist state to a Catholic, corporate and increasingly demobilized authoritarian regime.<ref>Stanley Payne: ''History of fascism.

P. 325</ref>\"When Franco's defeat loomed around 1943, Franco withdrew from the Axis powers. He declared Spain neutral this year and, in exchange for allied oil supplies, largely cushioned Germany's material and non-material support. He also dismissed the sympathetic members of his government, including his brother-in-law [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er]]. This shift allowed Franco to appease the Allies. In addition, during the Second World War, the abolition of external symbols such as the Fascist salute came. For Franco, Hitler and Mussolini were only interesting as long as they were powerful and he had something to expect from them. Another aspect, however, is that Spain, still severely weakened by the recent civil war, could not afford to participate in another [[military|gun]] campaign.\n\nAfter the war, Spain was stationed on one of the so-called [[rat lines]], the escape routes of the dignitaries of both the Nazi regime itself and its ideological allies - often for the purpose of traveling to [[South America]]. Some of them also found refuge in Spain itself, such as [[L\u00e9on Degrelle]], leader of the Belgian [[Rexists]].\n\n=== postwar ===\nAfter the Second World War, the occupied and divided Germany initially fell out as a player on the international stage. After the victory of the Western democracies, the Spanish dictatorship was naturally isolated, which should, however, be defused by the looming [[Cold War]] for Franco.\n\nIn 1955, Spain was admitted to the United Nations. In 1973, the German Democratic Republic followed as the 133rd and the Federal Republic of Germany as the 134th member. From the beginning of the 1960s, Franco sought an [association] agreement with the [[European Community|EC]]. He submitted an application on February 9, 1962. It was only in 1966 that negotiations began, which were delayed until the conclusion of a first agreement in 1970, mainly due to political reservations of the then six states (including the FRG).\n\n=== After the end of the Spanish dictatorship ===\n[[File: Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez se entrevista con el canciller de Alemania.jpg | thumb|upright = 1.5 | Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez and Helmut Kohl (1993)]]\nThe Spanish isolation could only be completely broken after Franco's death in 1975 and the subsequent democratization under King [[Juan Carlos I]].\n\nSpain joined the [[NATO]] in 1982; The Federal Republic of Germany belonged to the Atlantic Pact since 1955. In 1986 Spain became a member of the European Community and in 1988 the Western European Union. Spain also decided to use the [[Euro]] as the currency together with Germany and other European partners (1999 as book money, cash introduction 2002), so that no currency exchange between the two countries is necessary.\n\n===21st Century===\nIn [[Iraq war]] in 2003, Spain joined the US despite the popular opposition of the \"[Coalition of the Willing One]\". Germany, together with Russia and France, refused to participate in the war on [[Saddam Hussein]] s. Foreign policy, however, Spain then approached again to Germany and France. Prime Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero|Zapatero]] withdrew the troops from Iraq by July 2004, but he soon added to the military contingent in [[Afghanistan]] in view of the relations with the US damaged by the withdrawal until November 2013 34 Spaniards died.<ref>{{Web Archive|url=http: //www.icasualties.org/oef/Nationality.aspx? hndQry = Spain|wayback=20150629014922|text=Operation Enduring Freedom, Coalition Deaths by Nationality}} Germany and Spain jointly participated in the Security and Reconstruction Mission under [NATO] International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).</ref>\n\n=== Current status ===\nThe relations between the [[Federal Government (Germany)|German Federal Government]] and the Government of Spain are unencumbered.

Nicknamed the '''Showplace of the Nation''', it is the headquarters for [[the Rockettes]], the precision dance company.\n\nRadio City Music Hall was built on a plot of land that was originally intended for a [[Metropolitan Opera]] House. The opera house plans were canceled in 1929, leading to the [[construction of Rockefeller Center]].\n\nRadio City Music Hall was designed by [[Edward Durell Stone]] and [[Donald Deskey]] in the [[Art Deco]] style. One of the more notable parts of the Music Hall is its large auditorium, which was the world's largest when the Hall first opened. The new complex included two theaters, the \"International Music Hall\" and the [[Center Theatre (New York City)|Center Theatre]], as part of the \"Radio City\" portion of Rockefeller Center. The 5,960-seat Music Hall was the larger of the two venues. It was largely successful until the 1970s, when declining patronage nearly drove the Music Hall to bankruptcy. Radio City Music Hall was designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City Landmark]] in May 1978, and the Music Hall was restored and allowed to remain open. The hall was extensively renovated in 1999.\n\nThe Music Hall also contains a variety of art. Although Radio City Music Hall was initially intended to host stage shows, it hosted performances in a film-and-stage-spectacle format through the 1970s, and was the site of several movie premieres. It now primarily hosts concerts, including by leading pop and rock musicians, and live stage shows such as the ''[[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]]''. The Music Hall has also hosted televised events including the [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Tony Awards]], the [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and the [[NFL Draft]].\n\n==History==\n{{Rockefeller Center map|highlight=9}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe [[construction of Rockefeller Center]] occurred between 1932 and 1940{{refn|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] was the first building to start construction, in March 1932.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/03/08/issue.html |title=First Steel Column Erected in 70-Story Rockefeller Unit |date=March 8, 1932 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |page=43}}</ref> The last building was completed in 1940.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/10/16/102265018.pdf |title=Airline Building is Dedicated Here; Governors of 17 States Take Part by Pressing Keys |date=October 16, 1940 |work=The New York Times|access-date=November 21, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>}} on land that [[John D.

The orchestra and mezzanine sections all contain reddish-brown plush seating throughout, as well as storage compartments under each seat, lights at the end of each row of seats, and more legroom space than in other theaters.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe auditorium's ceiling is ringed with eight telescoping bands, the \"northern lights\" Haskell described.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the bands' edges contain a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}} overlap with each other. In Joseph Urban's original plans, the ceiling was to be [[coffer]]ed, but after the cancellation of the Opera House, designers proposed many different designs for the proposed Music Hall's ceiling. The current design was put forth by [[Raymond Hood]], who incidentally derived his band-system idea from a book that Urban had written.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} The walls are covered by intricate fabric silhouette patterns of performers and horses, which were created by Reeves.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=25}} The radiating arches of the proscenium unite the large auditorium, allowing a sense of intimacy as well as grandeur. The ceiling arches also contain grilles that camouflage the air conditioning and the auditorium's sound system.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Great Stage, designed by [[Peter Clark (expert of theatre)|Peter Clark]], measures {{convert|66.5|by|144|ft|abbr=on}} and resembles a setting sun.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27 |title=Secrets of the Magic Theater |journal=Popular Mechanics |page=27 |date=January 1941 |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=215}} Roxy reportedly envisioned the sunset design of the stage while traveling home from Europe on an ocean liner.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=93}} There are two stage curtains; the main one is made of steel and asbestos, which can part horizontally, while the plush curtain behind it has several horizontal sections that can be raised or lowered independently of each other. The center of the stage consists of a rotating section of floor with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The [[orchestra pit]], which could fit 75 musicians, was placed on a \"bandwagon\" that could move vertically or longitudinally relative to the stage.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=19}}\n\nThere is a complicated system of indirect [[cove lighting]] at the front of the stage, facing toward the audience. When the Music Hall was first opened, it was equipped with all of the newest lighting innovations at the time, including lights that changed colors automatically and adjusted their own brightness based on different lighting levels in the theater.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}\n\n====Mezzanines====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 2156405720 04ba258234.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of mezzanine balconies from orchestra seating]]\nThe Music Hall contains three mezzanines within the back wall of the auditorium,{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=4}} as well as a main lounge in the basement.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the mezzanines is shallow, and all three mezzanine levels are stacked on top of the orchestra's rear seats. Ramps on either side of the stage lead to the first mezzanine level, the lowest of the three mezzanines, creating the impression of a stage encircling the orchestra.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} Each of the three mezzanine levels has a men's smoking room, a women's lounge, and men's and women's restrooms. No two restrooms or lounges have the same design.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}} A 1932 ''New York Times''  article described the reasons for such varied designs: \"Since the auditoriums, men's lobbies, smoking rooms and women's lounges are used for a few hours only, decorative schemes are appropriate in them that would be too dramatic for a home.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932\">{{cite news | title=Modern Decorations on a Grand Scale |first=Walter Rendell |last=Storey | work=The New York Times | date=December 25, 1932 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/12/25/100885919.pdf | access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Main lounge====\nThe main lounge in the basement is decorated with a design rivaling the grand foyer above it. The walls are composed of black \"permatex\", which was a new material at the time of the Music Hall's construction. The ceiling has diamond-shaped light fixtures and is supported by six diamond-shaped [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], as well as three full-height piers of a similar shape that exist only for aesthetic purposes.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The lounge is decorated with several artworks (see {{section link||Art}}).{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=13\u201314}} Deskey also designed the chrome furniture and the carpeting of the lounge.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}}\n\nThe landing for the Music Hall's elevator bank is located on the northern side of the main lounge. A marble wall with three large columns comprises the western side of the lounge. A hallway extends off the eastern side of the lounge and leads to a men's smoking room and a women's lounge, which both connect to restrooms of their respective genders.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}} The smoking room has a masculine theme with terrazzo floors, brown walls, and copper ceilings. The accompanying men's restroom has black-and-white tiles and simple geometric fixtures, which are duplicated in the men's restrooms on each mezzanine level.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=14\u201315}} The women's lounge is mostly designed with the same soft colors as [[Witold Gordon]]'s \"History of Cosmetics Mural\", located on the room's walls, although the wall area not covered by the mural is painted beige. The attached women's restroom is similar to the men's restroom on the same floor but contains vertical cylindrical lighting, stools, and circular mirrors above aqua sinks.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}}\n\n====Offstage====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall stage hydraulics.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Backstage hydraulic system]]\nThe [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|offstage]] area of the Music Hall contains many rooms that allow all productions to be prepared on-site.

Nicknamed the '''Showplace of the Nation''', it is the headquarters for [[the Rockettes]], the precision dance company.\n\nRadio City Music Hall was built on a plot of land that was originally intended for a [[Metropolitan Opera]] House. The opera house plans were canceled in 1929, leading to the [[construction of Rockefeller Center]].\n\nRadio City Music Hall was designed by [[Edward Durell Stone]] and [[Donald Deskey]] in the [[Art Deco]] style. One of the more notable parts of the Music Hall is its large auditorium, which was the world's largest when the Hall first opened. The new complex included two theaters, the \"International Music Hall\" and the [[Center Theatre (New York City)|Center Theatre]], as part of the \"Radio City\" portion of Rockefeller Center. The 5,960-seat Music Hall was the larger of the two venues. It was largely successful until the 1970s, when declining patronage nearly drove the Music Hall to bankruptcy. Radio City Music Hall was designated a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City Landmark]] in May 1978, and the Music Hall was restored and allowed to remain open. The hall was extensively renovated in 1999.\n\nThe Music Hall also contains a variety of art. Although Radio City Music Hall was initially intended to host stage shows, it hosted performances in a film-and-stage-spectacle format through the 1970s, and was the site of several movie premieres. It now primarily hosts concerts, including by leading pop and rock musicians, and live stage shows such as the ''[[Radio City Christmas Spectacular]]''. The Music Hall has also hosted televised events including the [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Tony Awards]], the [[Daytime Emmy Awards]], the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and the [[NFL Draft]].\n\n==History==\n{{Rockefeller Center map|highlight=9}}\n\n===Planning===\nThe [[construction of Rockefeller Center]] occurred between 1932 and 1940{{refn|[[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] was the first building to start construction, in March 1932.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/03/08/issue.html |title=First Steel Column Erected in 70-Story Rockefeller Unit |date=March 8, 1932 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 15, 2017 |page=43}}</ref> The last building was completed in 1940.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/10/16/102265018.pdf |title=Airline Building is Dedicated Here; Governors of 17 States Take Part by Pressing Keys |date=October 16, 1940 |work=The New York Times|access-date=November 21, 2017 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>}} on land that [[John D.

From that the energy disperses, like a firmament the arched structure rises outward and forward. The 'ceiling', uniting sides and top in its one great curve, proceeds by successive broad bands, like the bands of northern lights.\"{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} In the hall's early years, the [[Federal Writer's Project]] noted that \"nearly everything about the Music Hall is tremendous\", with the hall hosting the world's largest orchestra; most expansive theater screen; heaviest [[proscenium]] arch used in a theater; and \"finest precision dancers\", [[the Rockettes]].{{sfn|Federal Writers' Project|1939|p=338}}\n\nThe auditorium has around 5,960 seats for spectators.{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=217}} Around 3,500 of these seats are located in the orchestra seating area on ground level, while the remaining seats are distributed among the three mezzanine levels (see {{section link||Mezzanines}}). The orchestra and mezzanine sections all contain reddish-brown plush seating throughout, as well as storage compartments under each seat, lights at the end of each row of seats, and more legroom space than in other theaters.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe auditorium's ceiling is ringed with eight telescoping bands, the \"northern lights\" Haskell described.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the bands' edges contain a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=on}} overlap with each other. In Joseph Urban's original plans, the ceiling was to be [[coffer]]ed, but after the cancellation of the Opera House, designers proposed many different designs for the proposed Music Hall's ceiling. The current design was put forth by [[Raymond Hood]], who incidentally derived his band-system idea from a book that Urban had written.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}} The walls are covered by intricate fabric silhouette patterns of performers and horses, which were created by Reeves.{{sfn|Roussel|2006|p=25}} The radiating arches of the proscenium unite the large auditorium, allowing a sense of intimacy as well as grandeur. The ceiling arches also contain grilles that camouflage the air conditioning and the auditorium's sound system.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}}\n\nThe Great Stage, designed by [[Peter Clark (expert of theatre)|Peter Clark]], measures {{convert|66.5|by|144|ft|abbr=on}} and resembles a setting sun.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftkDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA27 |title=Secrets of the Magic Theater |journal=Popular Mechanics |page=27 |date=January 1941 |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Okrent|2003|p=215}} Roxy reportedly envisioned the sunset design of the stage while traveling home from Europe on an ocean liner.{{sfn|Balfour|1978|p=93}} There are two stage curtains; the main one is made of steel and asbestos, which can part horizontally, while the plush curtain behind it has several horizontal sections that can be raised or lowered independently of each other. The center of the stage consists of a rotating section of floor with a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on}} diameter.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The [[orchestra pit]], which could fit 75 musicians, was placed on a \"bandwagon\" that could move vertically or longitudinally relative to the stage.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=19}}\n\nThere is a complicated system of indirect [[cove lighting]] at the front of the stage, facing toward the audience. When the Music Hall was first opened, it was equipped with all of the newest lighting innovations at the time, including lights that changed colors automatically and adjusted their own brightness based on different lighting levels in the theater.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=9}}\n\n====Mezzanines====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall 2156405720 04ba258234.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|View of mezzanine balconies from orchestra seating]]\nThe Music Hall contains three mezzanines within the back wall of the auditorium,{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=4}} as well as a main lounge in the basement.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} Each of the mezzanines is shallow, and all three mezzanine levels are stacked on top of the orchestra's rear seats. Ramps on either side of the stage lead to the first mezzanine level, the lowest of the three mezzanines, creating the impression of a stage encircling the orchestra.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=5}} Each of the three mezzanine levels has a men's smoking room, a women's lounge, and men's and women's restrooms. No two restrooms or lounges have the same design.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}} A 1932 ''New York Times''  article described the reasons for such varied designs: \"Since the auditoriums, men's lobbies, smoking rooms and women's lounges are used for a few hours only, decorative schemes are appropriate in them that would be too dramatic for a home.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes-Modern-Decorations-1932\">{{cite news | title=Modern Decorations on a Grand Scale |first=Walter Rendell |last=Storey | work=The New York Times | date=December 25, 1932 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1932/12/25/100885919.pdf | access-date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Main lounge====\nThe main lounge in the basement is decorated with a design rivaling the grand foyer above it. The walls are composed of black \"permatex\", which was a new material at the time of the Music Hall's construction. The ceiling has diamond-shaped light fixtures and is supported by six diamond-shaped [[Pier (architecture)|piers]], as well as three full-height piers of a similar shape that exist only for aesthetic purposes.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=13}} The lounge is decorated with several artworks (see {{section link||Art}}).{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=13\u201314}} Deskey also designed the chrome furniture and the carpeting of the lounge.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}}\n\nThe landing for the Music Hall's elevator bank is located on the northern side of the main lounge. A marble wall with three large columns comprises the western side of the lounge. A hallway extends off the eastern side of the lounge and leads to a men's smoking room and a women's lounge, which both connect to restrooms of their respective genders.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=14}} The smoking room has a masculine theme with terrazzo floors, brown walls, and copper ceilings. The accompanying men's restroom has black-and-white tiles and simple geometric fixtures, which are duplicated in the men's restrooms on each mezzanine level.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|pp=14\u201315}} The women's lounge is mostly designed with the same soft colors as [[Witold Gordon]]'s \"History of Cosmetics Mural\", located on the room's walls, although the wall area not covered by the mural is painted beige. The attached women's restroom is similar to the men's restroom on the same floor but contains vertical cylindrical lighting, stools, and circular mirrors above aqua sinks.{{sfn|Radio City Music Hall Landmark Designation|1978|p=15}}\n\n====Offstage====\n[[File:Radio City Music Hall stage hydraulics.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Backstage hydraulic system]]\nThe [[Parts of a theatre#Backstage or offstage|offstage]] area of the Music Hall contains many rooms that allow all productions to be prepared on-site.
