The society described in the book is one of the first ecological [[utopia]]s and was influential on the [[counterculture]] and the [[green politics|green movement]] in the 1970s and thereafter.  The author himself claimed that the society he depicted in the book is not a true utopia (in the sense of a perfect society), but, while guided by societal intentions and values, was ''im''perfect and in-process.<ref name=\"Callenbach, Ernest and Heddle, James\">{{cite web\n| title= \"Ecotopia Then & Now,\" an interview with Ernest Callenbach\n| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYc9myGMmTc\n| accessdate=2013-04-06\n|author1=Callenbach, Ernest  |author2=Heddle, James\n}}</ref>\n\nCallenbach said of the story, in relation to Americans:  \u201cIt is so hard to imagine anything fundamentally different from what we have now.

The \"leading edges\" (his main ideas for Ecotopian values and practices) were patterns in actual social experimentation taking place in the [[Western United States|American West]].<ref>Kirk, Andrew G.

Much of the environmentally benign energy, home building and transportation technology described by the author was based on his reading of research findings published in such journals as ''[[Scientific American]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.<ref name=\"Callenbach, Ernest\">{{cite web\n| title= \"Life in a Desirable Future,\" a talk at the Rubenstein School for Environment & Natural Resources at the University of Vermont\n| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7nSASQy0ys&NR=1&feature=endscreen\n| accessdate=2013-04-05\n| author=Callenbach, Ernest\n}}</ref>\n\nCallenbach\u2019s concept does not reject [[high tech]]nology (or ''any'' technology) as long as it does not interfere with the Ecotopian social order and serves the overall objectives.

Prior to Weston's reporting, most Americans had been barred from entering the new country, which is depicted as being on continual guard against [[revanchism]].  The new nation of Ecotopia consists of [[Northern California]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]; it is hinted that [[Southern California]] is a lost cause.  The novel takes its form as a narrative from Weston's diary in combination with dispatches that he transmits to his publication, the fictional ''Times-Post''.\n\nAt the beginning, Weston is skeptically curious about, not yet sympathetic to the Ecotopians.  He describes details of the Ecotopian transportation system and the preferred lifestyle.  This includes a wide range of gender roles, [[Sexual norm|sexual freedom]], and acceptance of non-monogamous relationships.  Liberal [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use is evident.  Televised passive, mass-media, spectator sports have been displaced in favor of local arts coverage, local participatory sports, and general fitness.  A large fraction of young male Ecotopians participate voluntarily in a decidedly male ritual of mock warfare using wooden spears but no guns or arrows.  The games are not re-enactments.  Physical injuries, occasionally serious, are considered part of the game.  Ecotopians on the whole value the benefits to young males over the accidental injuries.  Ecotopia also tolerates the voluntary separatism of many people of African descent who have, in fact, chosen to live in a mini-nation in the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|San Francisco East Bay-area]].\n\nEcotopian society has favored decentralized and renewable energy production and green building construction.  The citizens are technologically creative, while remaining involved with and sensitive to nature.  Thorough-going education reform is described, along with a highly localized system of universal medical care. (The narrator discovers that Ecotopian healing practices may include sexual stimulation.)  The national defense strategy has focused on developing a highly advanced arms industry, while also allegedly maintaining hidden [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] within major US population centers to discourage conquest and annexation.\n\nThrough Weston's diary we learn of observations he does not include in his columns, such as his personally transformative love affair with an Ecotopian woman.  The book's parallel narrative structures allow the reader to see how Weston's internal reflections, as recorded in his diary, are diffracted in his external pronouncements to his readers.  Despite Weston's initial reservations, throughout the novel Ecotopian citizens are characterized as clever, technologically resourceful, emotionally expressive, and even occasionally violent \u2013 but also socially responsible, patriotic.  They often live in extended families, and tend to live by choice in ethnically separated localities.  Their economic enterprises are generally employee-owned and -controlled.  The current governmental administration is that of a woman-led (but not exclusively female) party, and government structures are highly decentralized.\n\nThe novel concludes with Weston's finding himself enchanted by Ecotopian life and deciding to stay in Ecotopia as its interpreter to the wider world.\n\n==Values exemplified in the novel==\nThe values embodied by those Ecotopians depicted in the novel reflect the values espoused by its author.  Callenbach said that his Ecotopians attach fundamental importance to environmental and social stability within which variety can flourish.  They value creativity.  They ensure equality for women.  They implement the protection and restoration of natural systems.  They promote food production in their cities.\n\nAs well, they treasure personal quality-of-life values, such as health and friendliness, and both meaningful discussion and play.<ref name=\"Callenbach, Ernest and Heddle, James\"/>\n\nCallenbach began writing the novel by depicting the [[recycling]] of valuable materials and substances by the society; he saw a much-expanded role for recycling of all sorts, and this is key to many concepts underpinning Ecotopia.<ref name=\"Callenbach, Ernest\"/>\n\n==Anticipation of emerging realities==\nWorth mentioning is Callenbach's speculation on the roles of TV in his envisioned society.  The author espoused the [[fly on the wall]] genre of direct political-process broadcasts, deeming them valuable to the citizenry.  In some ways anticipating [[C-SPAN]], which would first be broadcast in 1979, ''Ecotopia'' mentions that the daily life of the legislature and some of that of the judicial courts is televised in Ecotopia.  Even highly technical debates are televised, addressing the needs and desires of Ecotopian viewers.\n\nAnother interesting detail in the story is \"[[print on demand]]\" (POD) publishing.  Ecotopian customers could choose selected print media from a [[jukebox]]-like device that would then print and bind the book.  In the 21st century, POD services that print, bind and ship books for customers who order on-line have become commonplace.\n\n==Impact==\nThe importance of this book is not so much its literary style as in the lively imagination of an alternative and ecologically sound lifestyle on a greater scale, presented more or less realistically.  It expressed on paper the dream of an alternative future held by many in the movements of the 1970s and later.  Even the names of the two characters most reflective of their respective viewpoints \u2013 \"Will West(on)\", the representative for materialist American culture and \"Vera Allwen\" (= \"All women + all men\"),  the President and spokeswoman for Ecotopia \u2013 suggest the degree to which the author intended the book to be a reflection of what he saw as American ecological and cultural deficiencies.\n\nHowever, in contrast to much of the Green movement in contemporary America, with its preference for regulation, Callenbach's Ecotopia has relatively laissez-faire economic tendencies, guided by intense moral pressure toward sustainable practices both in private life and in business.\n\nIn 1981, Callenbach published ''[[Ecotopia Emerging]]'', a multi-strand \"prequel\" suggesting how the sustainable nation of Ecotopia could have come into existence.\n\nIn 1990, Audio Renaissance released a partial dramatization of ''Ecotopia'' on audiocassettes in the form of recordings of a radio network broadcast (the ''Allied News Network'' replacing the ''Times-Post''). The tape-recorded diaries of William Weston were read by the book's author, Ernest Callenbach. Weston's reports were read by veteran news reporter [[Edwin Newman]].\n\nIn the online ''Earth Island Journal'', ''Ecotopia'' was reviewed by Brian Smith, identifying himself as a child not of the 1960s but the 1980s.  He read the novel 30 years after it was first published, and said of it: \"I felt great affinity for the details of the world Callenbach predicted. Even better, I was impressed by how many of his ideas came to pass.\"<ref name=\"A Child of Dystopia Reads Ecotopia\">{{cite web\n| title= A Child of Dystopia Reads Ecotopia\n| url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/a_child_of_dystopia_reads_ecotopia/\n| accessdate=2013-04-21\n| author=Smith, Brian\n}}</ref>\n\n''Ecotopia'' is now required reading in a number of colleges (see ''[[New York Times]]'' article \"The Novel That Predicted Portland\" referenced below).\n\n==Reception==\nDon Milligan in the British magazine ''[[Peace News]]'' gave ''Ecotopia'' a negative review, stating \"''Ecotopia'' is a shoddy amalgam of Swedish social democracy, Swiss neutrality, and Yugoslav workers' co-ops cobbled together with the authoritarianism of ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]''...''Ecotopia'' is a flawed vision of a flawed future.\"<ref>Milligan, Don. \"Utopia Limited\". ''Peace News'' 2977.  25 August 1978,  (p.14).</ref>\n\nIn marked contrast, [[Ralph Nader]] praised the book, noting that \"None of the happy conditions in Ecotopia are beyond the technical or resource reach of our society.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/book/23059/ecotopia-by-ernest-callenbach/9780553348477/?view=praise|title=Ecotopia by  Ernest Callenbach|publisher=Random House|accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Scott Timberg, quoting University of Nevada environmental-literature professor Scott Slovic in ''The New York Times'', \"'Ecotopia' [the concept] became almost immediately absorbed into the popular culture.  You hear people talking about the idea of Ecotopia, or about the Northwest as Ecotopia.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/fashion/14ecotopia.html?pagewanted=2&_r=2& Timberg, Scott 12/14/2008]</ref>\n\nIn ''bolo\u2019bolo'', P.M. criticizes Callenbach by saying: {{cquote|Dollars keep circulating in his ''Ecotopia'' just as they did before. It is nonsense to propose a system of direct, personal and ecological exchange and to permit at the same time the vehicle of anonymous, indirect, centralized circulation (money). Money as a general means of measurement presupposes mass-production (only in this case are goods measurable and comparable), a centralized bank system, mass distribution, etc. It is exactly this basic anonymity and non-responsibility of everyone for everything that causes and permits all those mechanisms of destruction of nature and people. As Callenbach poses these mechanisms as a moral problem (respect for nature, etc.), he needs a (very sympathetic, very democratic, even feminized) central State (The Big Sister) to repair the damage done by the system, through price controls, regulations, laws and prisons (of course, these latter only \u201ctraining camps\u201d).

The society described in the book is one of the first ecological [[utopia]]s and was influential on the [[counterculture]] and the [[green politics|green movement]] in the 1970s and thereafter.  The author himself claimed that the society he depicted in the book is not a true utopia (in the sense of a perfect society), but, while guided by societal intentions and values, was ''im''perfect and in-process.<ref name=\"Callenbach, Ernest and Heddle, James\">{{cite web\n| title= \"Ecotopia Then & Now,\" an interview with Ernest Callenbach\n| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYc9myGMmTc\n| accessdate=2013-04-06\n|author1=Callenbach, Ernest  |author2=Heddle, James\n}}</ref>\n\nCallenbach said of the story, in relation to Americans:  \u201cIt is so hard to imagine anything fundamentally different from what we have now.  But without these alternate visions, we get stuck on dead center.  And we\u2019d better get ready.

The \"leading edges\" (his main ideas for Ecotopian values and practices) were patterns in actual social experimentation taking place in the [[Western United States|American West]].<ref>Kirk, Andrew G.

University Press of Kansas. p. 86. {{ISBN|978-0-7006-1545-2}}.</ref> To draw an example, Callenbach's fictional Crick School was based upon Pinel School, an [[Alternative education|alternative school]] located outside [[Martinez, California]], and attended for a time by his son.\n\nCallenbach placed the genesis of Ecotopia with an article he researched and wrote titled \"The Scandal of Our Sewage\".<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/harvey-wasserman/a-green-powered-trip-to-e_b_211456.html</ref>\nBesides the important social dimensions of the story, he talked publicly about being influenced, during work on the novel, by numerous streams of thought:  scientific discoveries in the fields of ecology and conservation biology;  the urban-ecology movement, concerned with a new approach to urban planning;  and the soft-energy movement, championed by [[Amory Lovins]] and others.  Much of the environmentally benign energy, homebuilding, and transportation technology described by the author was based on his reading of research findings published in such journals as ''[[Scientific American]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.<ref name=\"Callenbach, Ernest\">{{cite web\n| title= \"Life in a Desirable Future,\" a talk at the Rubenstein School for Environment & Natural Resources at the University of Vermont\n| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7nSASQy0ys&NR=1&feature=endscreen\n| accessdate=2013-04-05\n| author=Callenbach, Ernest\n}}</ref>\n\nCallenbach\u2019s concept does not reject [[high tech]]nology (or ''any'' technology) as long as it does not interfere with the Ecotopian social order and serves the overall objectives.  Members of his fictional society prefer to demonstrate a ''conscious selectivity'' toward technology, so that not only human health and sanity might be preserved, but also social and ecological wellbeing. Hence, as an example, Callenbach\u2019s story anticipated the development and liberal usage of [[videoconferencing]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nDuring the 1970s when ''Ecotopia'' was written and published, many prominent counterculture and new left thinkers decried the consumption and overabundance that they perceived as characteristic of post-World War Two America.<ref>Kirk, Andrew G.

This book could be interpreted as \u201ca protest against consumerism and materialism, among other aspects of American life.\"<ref name=\"Hilton, Matthew 2007\"/>\n\nThe term \"[[Utopian and dystopian fiction#Ecotopian fiction|ecotopian fiction]]\", as a subgenre of science fiction and [[utopian fiction]], makes implicit reference to this book.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe book is set in 1999 (25 years in the future from 1974) and consists of diary entries and reports of journalist William Weston, who is the first American [[mainstream media]] reporter to investigate Ecotopia, a small country that [[secession|broke away]] from the [[United States]] in 1980. Prior to Weston's reporting, most Americans had been barred from entering the new country, which is depicted as being on continual guard against [[revanchism]].  The new nation of Ecotopia consists of [[Northern California]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]; it is hinted that [[Southern California]] is a lost cause.  The novel takes its form as a narrative from Weston's diary in combination with dispatches that he transmits to his publication, the fictional ''Times-Post''.\n\nAt the beginning, Weston is skeptically curious about, not yet sympathetic to the Ecotopians.  He describes details of the Ecotopian transportation system and the preferred lifestyle.  This includes a wide range of gender roles, [[Sexual norm|sexual freedom]], and acceptance of non-monogamous relationships.  Liberal [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use is evident.  Televised passive, mass-media, spectator sports have been  displaced in favor of local arts coverage, local participatory sports, and general fitness.  A large fraction of young male Ecotopians participate voluntarily in a decidedly male ritual of mock warfare.  The games are not re-enactments.  Actual wooden spears are used (no guns or arrows).  Physical injuries, occasionally serious, are considered part of the game.  Ecotopians on the whole value the benefits to young males over the accidental, unplanned actual injuries incurred.  Ecotopia also tolerates the voluntary separatism of many people of African descent who have, in fact, chosen to live in a mini-nation in the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|San Francisco East Bay-area]].\n\nEcotopian society has favored decentralized and renewable energy production and green building construction.  The citizens are technologically creative, while remaining involved with and sensitive to nature.  Thorough-going education reform is described, along with a highly localized system of universal medical care. (The narrator discovers that Ecotopian healing practices may include sexual stimulation.)  The national defense strategy has focused on developing a highly advanced arms industry, while also allegedly maintaining hidden [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] within major US population centers to discourage conquest and annexation.\n\nThrough Weston's diary we learn of observations he does not include in his columns, such as his personally transformative love affair with an Ecotopian woman.  The book's parallel narrative structures allow the reader to see how Weston's internal reflections, as recorded in his diary, are diffracted in his external pronouncements to his readers.  Despite Weston's initial reservations, throughout the novel Ecotopian citizens are characterized as clever, technologically resourceful, emotionally expressive, and even occasionally violent \u2013 but also socially responsible, patriotic.  They often live in extended families, and tend to live by choice in ethnically separated localities.  Their economic enterprises are generally employee-owned and -controlled.  The current governmental administration is that of a woman-led (but not exclusively female) party, and government structures are highly decentralized.\n\nThe novel concludes with Weston's finding himself enchanted by Ecotopian life and deciding to stay in Ecotopia as its interpreter to the wider world.\n\n==Values exemplified in the novel==\nThe values embodied by those Ecotopians depicted in the novel reflect the values espoused by its author.  Callenbach said that his Ecotopians attach fundamental importance to environmental and social stability within which variety can flourish.  They value creativity.  They ensure equality for women.  They implement the protection and restoration of natural systems.  They promote food production in their cities.\n\nAs well, they treasure personal quality-of-life values, such as health and friendliness, and both meaningful discussion and play.<ref name=\"Callenbach, Ernest and Heddle, James\"/>\n\nCallenbach began writing the novel by depicting the [[recycling]] of valuable materials and substances by the society; he saw a much-expanded role for recycling of all sorts, and this is key to many concepts underpinning Ecotopia.<ref name=\"Callenbach, Ernest\"/>\n\n==Anticipation of emerging realities==\nWorth mentioning is Callenbach's speculation on the roles of TV in his envisioned society.  The author espoused the [[fly on the wall]] genre of direct political-process broadcasts, deeming them valuable to the citizenry.  In some ways anticipating [[C-SPAN]], which would first be broadcast in 1979, ''Ecotopia'' mentions that the daily life of the legislature and some of that of the judicial courts is televised in Ecotopia.  Even highly technical debates are televised, addressing the needs and desires of Ecotopian viewers.\n\nAnother interesting detail in the story is \"[[print on demand]]\" (POD) publishing.  Ecotopian customers could choose selected print media from a [[jukebox]]-like device that would then print and bind the book.  In the 21st century, POD services that print, bind and ship books for customers who order on-line have become commonplace.\n\n==Impact==\nThe importance of this book is not so much to be found in its literary style as in the lively imagination of an alternative and ecologically sound lifestyle on a greater scale, presented more or less realistically.  It expressed on paper the dream of an alternative future held by many in the movements of the 1970s and later.  Even the names of the two characters most reflective of their respective viewpoints \u2013 \"Will West(on)\", the representative for materialist American culture and \"Vera Allwen\" (= \"All women + all men\"),  the President and spokeswoman for Ecotopia \u2013 suggest the degree to which the author intended the book to be a reflection of what he saw as American ecological and cultural deficiencies.\n\nHowever, in contrast to much of the Green movement in contemporary America, with its preference for regulation, Callenbach's Ecotopia has relatively laissez-faire economic tendencies, guided by intense moral pressure toward sustainable practices both in private life and in business.\n\nIn 1981, Callenbach published ''[[Ecotopia Emerging]]'', a multi-strand \"prequel\" suggesting how the sustainable nation of Ecotopia could have come into existence.\n\nIn 1990, Audio Renaissance released a partial dramatization of ''Ecotopia'' on audiocassettes in the form of recordings of a radio network broadcast (the ''Allied News Network'' replacing the ''Times-Post''). The tape-recorded diaries of William Weston were read by the book's author, Ernest Callenbach. Weston's reports were read by veteran news reporter [[Edwin Newman]].\n\nIn the online ''Earth Island Journal'', ''Ecotopia'' was reviewed by Brian Smith, identifying himself as a child not of the 1960s but the 1980s.  He read the novel 30 years after it was first published, and said of it: \"I felt great affinity for the details of the world Callenbach predicted. Even better, I was impressed by how many of his ideas came to pass.\"<ref name=\"A Child of Dystopia Reads Ecotopia\">{{cite web\n| title= A Child of Dystopia Reads Ecotopia\n| url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/a_child_of_dystopia_reads_ecotopia/\n| accessdate=2013-04-21\n| author=Smith, Brian\n}}</ref>\n\n''Ecotopia'' is now required reading in a number of colleges (see ''[[New York Times]]'' article \"The Novel That Predicted Portland\" referenced below).\n\n==Reception==\nDon Milligan in the British magazine ''[[Peace News]]'' gave ''Ecotopia'' a negative review, stating \"''Ecotopia'' is a shoddy amalgam of Swedish social democracy, Swiss neutrality, and Yugoslav workers' co-ops cobbled together with the authoritarianism of ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]''...''Ecotopia'' is a flawed vision of a flawed future.\"<ref>Milligan, Don. \"Utopia Limited\". ''Peace News'' 2977.  25 August 1978,  (p.14).</ref>\n\nIn marked contrast, [[Ralph Nader]] praised the book, noting that \"None of the happy conditions in Ecotopia are beyond the technical or resource reach of our society.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/book/23059/ecotopia-by-ernest-callenbach/9780553348477/?view=praise|title=Ecotopia by  Ernest Callenbach|publisher=Random House|accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Scott Timberg, quoting University of Nevada environmental-literature professor Scott Slovic in ''The New York Times'', \"'Ecotopia' [the concept] became almost immediately absorbed into the popular culture.  You hear people talking about the idea of Ecotopia, or about the Northwest as Ecotopia.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/fashion/14ecotopia.html?pagewanted=2&_r=2& Timberg, Scott 12/14/2008]</ref>\n\nIn ''bolo\u2019bolo'', P.M. criticizes Callenbach by saying: {{cquote|Dollars keep circulating in his ''Ecotopia'' just as they did before. It is nonsense to propose a system of direct, personal and ecological exchange and to permit at the same time the vehicle of anonymous, indirect, centralized circulation (money). Money as a general means of measurement presupposes mass-production (only in this case are goods measurable and comparable), a centralized bank system, mass distribution, etc. It is exactly this basic anonymity and non-responsibility of everyone for everything that causes and permits all those mechanisms of destruction of nature and people. As Callenbach poses these mechanisms as a moral problem (respect for nature, etc.), he needs a (very sympathetic, very democratic, even feminized) central State (The Big Sister) to repair the damage done by the system, through price controls, regulations, laws and prisons (of course, these latter only \u201ctraining camps\u201d). What he allows economically he has to forbid politically: the space for morality is opened.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village. Although not [[Rajput]]s, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of [[hypergamy|hypergamous]] marriage,{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=169|ps=}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status.{{sfn|Fuller|1975|pp=293-295|ps=}} There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}}\n\nThrough the colonial [[British Raj]] period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants,{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}} The term ''[[Darbar (title)|Darbar]]'' is used to/by kolis. Darbar is equal to ''[[Kshatriya]].'' By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the [[Patidar]]{{efn|The Patidars were formerly known as [[Kanbi]], but by 1931 had gained official recognition as Patidar.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}}} community due to the land reforms of the Raj period.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed [[sanskritisation]]. At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the [[Varna (Hinduism)|ritual title]] of [[Kshatriya]]. The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers&nbsp;\u2014 around 4 - 5 per cent of the population&nbsp;\u2014 were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted. The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a [[Criminal Tribes|criminal tribe]] by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya. The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nIn 1947, around the time that [[Independence of India|India gained independence]], the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an [[umbrella organisation]] to continue the work begun during the Raj. [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a French political scientist, says that this body, which claimed to represent the Rajputs and Kolis, \"...&nbsp;is a good example of the way castes, with very different ritual status, join hands to defend their common interests.&nbsp;... The use of the word Kshatriya was largely tactical and the original caste identity was seriously diluted.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nThe relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as [[Other Backward Class|Backward Classes]] in the Indian [[Reservation in India|scheme for positive discrimination]]. Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires. By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land. It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the [[Indian National Congress]] and then, by the early 1960s, with the [[Swatantra Party]].\n\nBy 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership. The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal [[Bhil people|Bhil]]s, with the Kolis in the middle. He notes that its composition reflects \"a common economic interest and a growing secular identity born partly out of folklore but more out of common resentment against the well-to-do castes\".{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=178|ps=}}\n\nThe Kolis of Gujarat remained educationally and occupationally disadvantaged compared to communities such as the [[Brahmin]]s and Patidars.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=302|ps=}} Their many [[J\u0101ti]]s include the [[Baria (caste)|Bareeya]], [[Khant caste|Khant]], [[Patanwadia]], [[Talpada]], Chunvalia and [[Thakor]], and they also use ''Koli'' as a suffix, giving rise to groups such as the Gulam Koli and Matia Koli.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village. Although not [[Rajput]]s, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of [[hypergamy|hypergamous]] marriage,{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=169|ps=}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status.{{sfn|Fuller|1975|pp=293-295|ps=}} There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}}\n\nThrough the colonial [[British Raj]] period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants,{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}} The term ''[[Darbar (title)|Darbar]]'' is used to/by kolis. Darbar is equal to ''[[Kshatriya]].'' By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the [[Patidar]]{{efn|The Patidars were formerly known as [[Kanbi]], but by 1931 had gained official recognition as Patidar.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}}} community due to the land reforms of the Raj period.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed [[sanskritisation]]. At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the [[Varna (Hinduism)|ritual title]] of [[Kshatriya]]. The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers&nbsp;\u2014 around 4 - 5 per cent of the population&nbsp;\u2014 were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted. The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a [[Criminal Tribes|criminal tribe]] by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya. The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nIn 1947, around the time that [[Independence of India|India gained independence]], the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an [[umbrella organisation]] to continue the work begun during the Raj. [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a French political scientist, says that this body, which claimed to represent the Rajputs and Kolis, \"...&nbsp;is a good example of the way castes, with very different ritual status, join hands to defend their common interests.&nbsp;... The use of the word Kshatriya was largely tactical and the original caste identity was seriously diluted.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nThe relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as [[Other Backward Class|Backward Classes]] in the Indian [[Reservation in India|scheme for positive discrimination]]. Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires. By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land. It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the [[Indian National Congress]] and then, by the early 1960s, with the [[Swatantra Party]].\n\nBy 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership. The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal [[Bhil people|Bhil]]s, with the Kolis in the middle. He notes that its composition reflects \"a common economic interest and a growing secular identity born partly out of folklore but more out of common resentment against the well-to-do castes\".{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=178|ps=}}\n\nThe Kolis of Gujarat remained educationally and occupationally disadvantaged compared to communities such as the [[Brahmin]]s and Patidars.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=302|ps=}} Their many [[J\u0101ti]]s include the [[Baria (caste)|Bareeya]], [[Khant caste|Khant]], [[Patanwadia]], [[Talpada]], Chunvalia and [[Thakor]], and they also use ''Koli'' as a suffix, giving rise to groups such as the Gulam Koli and Matia Koli. Some do not refer to themselves as Koli at all.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=221|ps=}}\n\n== Military Involvement ==\n[[File:Samadhi Of Tanaji Malusare.jpg|thumb|Samadhi of Maratha Koli general ''Sardar Tanajirao Malusare]]\n[[File:Sarkhel Kanhoji Angre I.jpg|thumb|''Sarkhel Kanhoji Raje Angre'', Maratha Koli admiral of Maratha Navy]]\nThe kolis of maharashtra played an important role from pre-maratha time.

From the history texts of piracy in India. In1734, kolis of gujarat were well engaged in piracy. They infested the coastline bof gujarat. They were well known for their infamous activities on the sea. The [[Royal Indian Navy|British Navy]] under Radford Nunn attacked at koli pirates and burnt nineteen armed vessels and fifty smalls of koli pirates after six months, their ten more vessels were fired by british. But it explains that koli pirates were notorious and challenge for maritime powers. At 21st January 1739, koli pirates with [[Siddi|Siddis]] of [[Murud-Janjira|Janjira]] capturef several british vessels among which was '<nowiki/>''Tiger Gallivat''<nowiki/>'. After few years in 1749, koli pirates captured the '''Bengal Ship''<nowiki/>' carrying sixty thousand cash and [[Cargo]] worth of equal amount. It was a big shock for british government. After that ''British Navy'' and ''[[Dutch India|Dutch Navy]]'' joined hand together to fight against koli pirates in 1750 and there was a fight at ''Kurla River'' and defeated the kolis and captured 23 armed vessels. After this fight, kolis silenced for long time. It seems that ''Koli Piracy'' was a headache for all naval powers of india.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Saletore|first=Rajaram Narayan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1PVMMoChwY4C&dq=Koli+Pirate&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Indian Pirates|date=1978|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPrincely states of [[Junagadh State|Junagadh]] and [[Bhavnagar State|Bhavnagar]] also suffered by koli piracy. during time of [[Thakur (title)|Thakur]] Akherajji Bhavsinhji [[Gohil]], [[Talaja]] was a stronghold of the koli pirates.

The design compromises made in fitting the large gun onto the Cromwell [[chassis]] resulted in a tank with a powerful weapon and reduced armour. The extemporised 17-pounder [[Sherman Firefly]] conversion of the US-supplied Sherman was easier to produce and, with delays in production, only 200 Challengers were built. The Challenger was able to keep up with the fast Cromwell tank and was used with them.\n\n==History==\nThe driving force in the development of the Challenger was [[William Arthur Robotham]]. \"Roy\" Robotham had been a Rolls-Royce executive in the car division who, with no work to do, had led a team to develop a tank powerplant from the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] aircraft engine. The [[Rolls-Royce Meteor]] gave the British a powerful, reliable engine, which was used in the A27M Cruiser Mk VIII [[Cromwell tank]]. Robotham's contributions gained him a place in the [[Ministry of Supply]] and on the Tank Board, despite his lack of experience in tank design.{{sfnp|Fletcher|1993}}\n\nThe [[General Staff]] brought forward specification A29 for a 45 ton, 17 pounder-armed cruiser tank based on needs identified in the African desert campaign. British tanks were generally underarmed compared to German vehicles. The design weight of this vehicle was subsequently seen as excessive and the specification was passed over in favour of the alternate specification, A30, which was {{convert|10|LT|t|abbr=on}} lighter.<ref>http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_cruiser_tank_A29.html ; retrieved 18 June 2016</ref> In 1942, an order for the development of an A30 based tank was placed with [[Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company]] (BRC&W) expecting it to be based on the Cromwell components also being manufactured by BRC&W. The turret and gun mounting were in the hands of [[Stothert & Pitt]]. Birmingham Carriage had to modify the Cromwell hull to take a bigger turret.\n\nThe first prototype was ready in August 1942, only seven months after development had commenced, but proved to be very flawed.  An improved second prototype was presented in January 1943 but was still considered unacceptable.  A committee met to determine whether a requirement for a 17-pounder tank existed. The Challenger had been developed in anticipation of more heavily armoured Axis tanks, following the trend in Nazi German tank design. At roughly the same time the [[Tiger 1]] entered service with the German army, placing an immediate need for a 17-pounder armed tank in response.{{sfnp|Robotham|1970}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}} When the second prototype was tested at [[Lulworth]], it was found that although it would be effective at long range against the current best-gunned tank in German service (the [[Panzer IV]] \"Special\" with the long {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun), at shorter ranges it would be at a disadvantage due to its slow firing rate and thin armour. The design received additional emphasis when, in May 1943, it was found in that the Cromwell could not carry its intended armament. [[Vickers]] had been developing a {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} L 50 calibre high velocity tank gun. It was realised late in the design process that the Cromwell's turret ring was too small for this gun.{{sfnp|Fletcher|2006}}{{page needed|date=June 2015}} The Challenger would be the only British cruiser tank to mount a weapon that could tackle heavier German armour until the arrival of the [[Comet tank|A34 Comet]]. Therefore already in February 1943 an order was made of two hundred vehicles.\n\nBritish tank production was constrained by limited resources and insufficient numbers could be made. This was compensated by American production. In the lead up to [[D-Day]], [[Sherman tank]]s were fitted with the 17 pounder, creating the interim 17 pounder [[Sherman Firefly]]. Converting Sherman tanks was simpler than producing Challengers, so it was decided in November 1943 to terminate the A30 production run after the two hundred vehicles had been built, allowing BRC&W to concentrate on the Cromwell. At the same time the A 40 \"Challenger Stage II\" project was cancelled, which had envisaged a 36 tonne type with heavier armour. Future design priority was concentrated on the A34 Comet, which eventually replaced the Cromwell, Firefly and Challenger. Challenger production started in March 1944. That year 145 vehicles were delivered with another 52 in 1945. Production was in two batches. A first run of forty vehicles had a 40 mm gun mantlet; with the second batch this was replaced by a 102 mm mantlet. From the hundredth vehicle onwards appliqu\u00e9 25 mm armour plates were fitted on the turret, that had already been applied to existing vehicles by field units.   \n\nThe tank was rendered obsolete when the Vickers HV 75&nbsp;mm gun was developed to become the {{nowrap|77 mm HV}} (actually 3 inch = 76.2&nbsp;mm calibre) to arm the Comet tank. The {{nowrap|77 mm HV}} used the same projectiles as the 17 pounder with a reduced propellant charge. The 17 pounder gun was reintroduced briefly on earlier marks of the Comet's successor, the [[Centurion tank]].\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Tanks and Afvs of the British Army 1939-45 KID906.jpg|thumb|Cruiser tank Challenger (A30)]]\nThe turret mounted the [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder]] gun required in the Tank Board specification and the hull machine gun was removed to provide stowage space for the long 17-pounder cartridges. The War Office expected that this larger ammunition, together with its stowage forward, would require two loaders, which raised the turret crew to four, the commander, gunner, loader 1 and loader 2. To fit the larger weapon ''and'' additional crewman in the turret, a much larger turret than that of the Cromwell was specified, developed separately, which had a significant effect on the design and was not resolved until later development of Avenger.\n\nTo carry the weight of the 17-pounder and ammunition, an extra wheel station and suspension arm was needed, lengthening the hull. This change in length, without a corresponding change in width across the tracks, reduced mobility compared to the Cromwell, although speed remained high at 25&nbsp;mph. To limit the weight, the amount of [[Vehicle armour|armour]] was reduced but this could only be achieved on the turret, {{convert|63|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the front and {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the sides compared to {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the Cromwell. The turret did not use a conventional turret ring: to increase the aperture diameter with four inches, it rested on a ball mount on the hull floor. As therefore the base of the turret was unprotected, and it would cantilever when struck by enemy rounds, a jacking feature, with four internal semi-automatic jacks, was fitted to clear jams. The additional length allowed larger hatches to be fitted in the hull while still clearing the turret, providing easier access than Cromwell.\n\n==Controversy==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nUpon Robotham's appointment as Chief Engineer to the Department of Tank Design, the lack of progress on an (A29) 17-pounder armed tank could not adequately be explained. Robotham's memoirs indicate a lack of awareness that any such requirement existed within the department and military users were still unsure whether the tank was required at the point when the rushed A30 design had been completed and prototype vehicles run.{{sfnp|Robotham|1970|p=165}} The Challenger was then rushed into production alongside existing production runs of Cromwell, limiting the number of tanks that could be produced.\n\nThe dubious reliability of earlier British tank designs, along with limited manufacturing capacity, led to a joint mission to the US to explore US tank options and share design experiences learned from action. Consequently, British and other Commonwealth forces introduced a much larger contingent of US-made vehicles, each using dual purpose 75 mm guns with reduced anti-armour capability (US doctrine placed artillery as the primary anti-tank weapon, while tanks used the dual-purpose gun to fire high-explosive shells at un-armoured targets).\n\nCromwells carrying the 6-pounder had been delayed in design and the move to cancel Challenger while switching Cromwell to the dual purpose 75 mm gun (with a corresponding drop in anti-armour performance) left British and other Commonwealth forces without a main-force tank weapon capable of taking on the equivalent generation of Axis tanks. The lack of firepower was keenly felt by tank crews fighting heavier armed and sometimes more heavily armoured, Axis tanks. The Firefly was used as a stop-gap, which was only resolved, much later, with the A34 Comet. While Comet improved significantly upon both Cromwell and Challenger designs, its design and production followed that of the Cromwell and was delayed much longer than an equivalent production (and evolution) of Challenger.\n\n==Performance==\nThe 17-pounder gun mounted on the Challenger offered sufficient performance against the majority of German AFVs, including the [[Tiger I]] and [[Panther tank]] and had a higher top speed and cross country mobility than the [[Panzer IV]] or [[StuG III]]. The armour of the Challenger offered very little protection against contemporary German anti-tank guns and was lower than that of the Cromwell, which often operated with Challengers.\n\nIn combat, the Challenger fulfilled much the same role as the Sherman Firefly, providing overwatch for the other tanks in the troop, as its 17-pounder could penetrate almost all German AFVs frontally, unlike the 75 mm. It was deployed in a similar manner at a troop level, this was typically one 17-pounder armed tank (such as Challenger or Firefly) to three 75 mm armed tanks (Cromwells or Shermans); at times, the deployment of 17-pounder armed tanks was increased to two per troop.\n\nThe Challenger was based on the reliable Cromwell tank, which used the new [[Rolls-Royce Meteor]] engine, which was far more reliable and powerful than the ageing Liberty engine used in earlier British Cruiser designs like the [[Crusader tank]]. Its reliability was slightly below that of the Cromwell, as a problem was experienced with track throwing, caused by mud building up in the wheels but this was resolved in the field.<ref>Track Throwing, 15.11.44; Rm/GB.5/SW.15.11.44</ref> Supply and maintenance were vastly simplified through the use of common parts with the Cromwell.\n\nIn comparison with the Firefly, the tank lacked the sloping forward armour but presented a lower profile and avoided the Firefly's constraint on gun depression. The Challenger provided 10{{formatnum:}}\u00b0 of gun depression while Firefly was limited to 5{{formatnum:}}\u00b0, which was significant disadvantage in combat.{{sfnp|Robotham|1970}} It was preferred within Cromwell units as it shared similar mobility and manoeuvrability, whereas the Firefly was slower. Despite a lower design weight than the earlier A29 specification, the Challenger was heavy and required dockyard equipment to ship, making it impractical to use in amphibious assaults, such as the D-day landings.\n\n==Service==\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 B11374.jpg|thumb|A Challenger tank crosses a [[Bailey bridge]] over the Dommel river in [[Sint-Michielsgestel|Sint-Michielsgestel, the Netherlands]]. 27 October 1944]]\nThe vehicle entered front-line service in July 1944 during the Allied invasion of Normandy but no provision had been made for [[deep wading]] trunking and the A30 was unable to participate in the landings; Challenger crews had to wait until the [[Mulberry harbour]]s were built and ports captured. The Challenger and Firefly, equipped with 17-pounder, were added to tank squadrons to deal with opposing heavy tanks and many Challengers were issued to reconnaissance units using Cromwells. It was initially used by the [[Guards Armoured Division]] and the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]], with about sixteen vehicles in each unit. The latter division phased the type out from February 1945 onwards, while it was being introduced to the Cromwell units of the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]]. The tank was unpopular at first, with crews complaining about the lack of armour, the high silhouette and the tracks being thrown.<ref>Note from Service Engineer, 15.11.44; AA.2/JB.11.11.44</ref> The track problem was caused by the smaller idler wheels compared to the Cromwell; these were in August replaced by idlers with a standard diameter. Troops used to the low profile of the Crusader and Cromwell found the height a serious problem, although it was still shorter than the comparable Sherman Firefly.\n\nConfidence in the vehicle grew and it became preferred over the Firefly, being lower, faster and more manoeuvrable but the early bad reputation persisted with others.<ref>The Rolls Royce Meteor - Cromwell and other applications; Historical Series No. 35 published by the Rolls Royce Heritage Trust</ref> Allied forces were issued with the Challenger, the [[1st Polish Armoured Division]] receiving several in mid-1945 and the [[1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade]] used it during the [[Siege_of_Dunkirk_(1944\u201345)|siege of Dunkirk in late 1944.]]<ref>Hayward ''The Other Challenger'' quoting Six Monthly RAC Progress Reports</ref>{{sfnp|Fletcher|2006|p=47}} After the war, the Czechoslovak government purchased 22 Challengers from the brigade inventory, which served in the Czechoslovak army (first with the 11th, later 23rd, Tank Brigade and then with the 13th Independent Tank Battalion) until they were put in reserve in 1951 and scrapped in 1959.<ref>{{cite book |last= Francev|first= Vladim\u00edr|title=\u010ceskoslovensk\u00e9 tankov\u00e9 s\u00edly 1945-1992 |year=2012 |publisher=Grada |location=Prague |isbn=9788024740294 |page=186}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n'''A30 Avenger SP2''' or '''SP 17pdr, A30 (Avenger)''' was a development of Challenger to be used as a self-propelled gun. It removed the second loader's position and featured a much lower profile turret and lower superstructure on the hull. An additional stowage bin was provided on the glacis plate for a large camo net and return rollers were added to the tracks.{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}\n\nAvenger featured a permanent opening in the turret roof covered with an armoured cover supported a few inches above. This provided the commander and loader with full 360 degree visibility.{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}<!-- note that the open top without cover is the prototype - please don't confuse this with a production vehicle -->\n\nAs many as 500 vehicles appear to have been planned and 230 vehicles were ordered from BRC&W, but this dropped to 80 with the end of the war. It is not known how many were actually built; the SP2 nomenclature indicates its production with the [[Valentine Archer]] (SP1) and [[Alecto (SPG)|Alecto]] (SP3).{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}\n\nAvenger suffered in trials as the engine had to remain running to run the turret traverse motor, because the noise and exhaust could give the vehicle away. Winter trials in a prolonged stationary position also failed in comparison with Archer, when Avenger's steering failed. Both vehicles had problems with camouflage. The vehicle was dropped from trials in 1950, along with removal of Achilles, its US derived equivalent.{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}\n\nWhile the Avenger was only used for trials and was ultimately unsuccessful as a self-propelled artillery piece, in comparison with the purpose built vehicles, it provides an interesting example of what could have been possible for the Challenger tank had it not been forced to accommodate the second loader and larger turret during the tank design. This is highlighted in Robotham's memoirs, indicating that it may have been corrected had design effort not moved to the Comet.{{sfnp|Robotham|1970}}\n\n==Survivors==\n[[File:A30 Challenger pic2.JPG|thumb|A30 Challenger, [[Overloon War Museum]]]]\nTwo vehicles survive, one at the [[Overloon War Museum]] in the Netherlands, acquired from the [[Muzeeaquarium Delfzijl]] in 1976; the other was awaiting restoration at the Isle of Wight Military Museum in the United Kingdom until its closure.

The 17 pounder gun was reintroduced briefly on earlier marks of the Comet's successor, the [[Centurion tank]].\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Tanks and Afvs of the British Army 1939-45 KID906.jpg|thumb|Cruiser tank Challenger (A30)]]\nThe turret mounted the [[Ordnance QF 17-pounder]] gun required in the Tank Board specification and the hull machine gun was removed to provide stowage space for the long 17-pounder cartridges. The War Office expected that this larger ammunition, together with its stowage forward, would require two loaders, which raised the turret crew to four, the commander, gunner, loader 1 and loader 2. To fit the larger weapon ''and'' additional crewman in the turret, a much larger turret than that of the Cromwell was specified, developed separately, which had a significant effect on the design and was not resolved until later development of Avenger.\n\nTo carry the weight of the 17-pounder and ammunition, an extra wheel station and suspension arm was needed, lengthening the hull. This change in length, without a corresponding change in width across the tracks, reduced mobility compared to the Cromwell, although speed remained high at 25&nbsp;mph. To limit the weight, the amount of [[Vehicle armour|armour]] was reduced but this could only be achieved on the turret, {{convert|63|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the front and {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the sides compared to {{convert|75|mm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the Cromwell. The turret did not use a conventional turret ring: to increase the aperture diameter with four inches, it rested on a ball mount on the hull floor. As therefore the base of the turret was unprotected, and it would cantilever when struck by enemy rounds, a jacking feature, with four internal semi-automatic jacks, was fitted to clear jams. The additional length allowed larger hatches to be fitted in the hull while still clearing the turret, providing easier access than Cromwell.\n\n==Controversy==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nUpon Robotham's appointment as Chief Engineer to the Department of Tank Design, the lack of progress on an (A29) 17-pounder armed tank could not adequately be explained. Robotham's memoirs indicate a lack of awareness that any such requirement existed within the department and military users were still unsure whether the tank was required at the point when the rushed A30 design had been completed and prototype vehicles run.{{sfnp|Robotham|1970|p=165}} The Challenger was then rushed into production alongside existing production runs of Cromwell, limiting the number of tanks that could be produced.\n\nThe dubious reliability of earlier British tank designs, along with limited manufacturing capacity, led to a joint mission to the US to explore US tank options and share design experiences learned from action. The British and Commonwealth forces introduced a much larger contingent of US-made vehicles, each using dual purpose 75 mm guns with reduced anti-armour capability (US doctrine placed artillery as the primary anti-tank weapon, while tanks used the dual-purpose gun to fire high-explosive shells at un-armoured targets).\n\nCromwells carrying the 6-pounder had been delayed in design and the move to cancel Challenger while switching Cromwell to the dual purpose 75 mm gun (with a corresponding drop in anti-armour performance) left British and Commonwealth forces without a main-force tank weapon capable of taking on the equivalent generation of Axis tanks. The lack of firepower was keenly felt by tank crews fighting heavier armed and sometimes more heavily armoured, Axis tanks. The Firefly was used as a stop-gap, which was only resolved, much later, with the A34 Comet. While Comet improved significantly upon both Cromwell and Challenger designs, its design and production followed that of the Cromwell and was delayed much longer than an equivalent production (and evolution) of Challenger.\n\n==Performance==\nThe 17-pounder gun mounted on the Challenger offered sufficient performance against the majority of German AFVs, including the [[Tiger I]] and [[Panther tank]] and had a higher top speed and cross country mobility than the [[Panzer IV]] or [[StuG III]]. The armour of the Challenger offered very little protection against contemporary German anti-tank guns and was lower than that of the Cromwell, which often operated with Challengers.\n\nIn combat, the Challenger fulfilled much the same role as the Sherman Firefly, providing overwatch for the other tanks in the troop, as its 17-pounder could penetrate almost all German AFVs frontally, unlike the 75 mm. It was deployed in a similar manner at a troop level, this was typically one 17-pounder armed tank (such as Challenger or Firefly) to three 75 mm armed tanks (Cromwells or Shermans); at times, the deployment of 17-pounder armed tanks was increased to two per troop.\n\nThe Challenger was based on the reliable Cromwell tank, which used the new [[Rolls-Royce Meteor]] engine, which was far more reliable and powerful than the ageing Liberty engine used in earlier British Cruiser designs like the [[Crusader tank]]. Its reliability was slightly below that of the Cromwell, as a problem was experienced with track throwing, caused by mud building up in the wheels but this was resolved in the field.<ref>Track Throwing, 15.11.44; Rm/GB.5/SW.15.11.44</ref> Supply and maintenance were vastly simplified through the use of common parts with the Cromwell.\n\nIn comparison with the Firefly, the tank lacked the sloping forward armour but presented a lower profile and avoided the Firefly's constraint on gun depression. The Challenger provided 10{{formatnum:}}\u00b0 of gun depression while Firefly was limited to 5{{formatnum:}}\u00b0, which was significant disadvantage in combat.{{sfnp|Robotham|1970}} It was preferred within Cromwell units as it shared similar mobility and manoeuvrability, whereas the Firefly was slower. Despite a lower design weight than the earlier A29 specification, the Challenger was heavy and required dockyard equipment to ship, making it impractical to use in amphibious assaults, such as the D-day landings.\n\n==Service==\n[[File:The British Army in North-west Europe 1944-45 B11374.jpg|thumb|A Challenger tank crosses a [[Bailey bridge]] over the Dommel river in [[Sint-Michielsgestel|Sint-Michielsgestel, the Netherlands]]. 27 October 1944]]\nThe vehicle entered front-line service in July 1944 during the Allied invasion of Normandy but no provision had been made for [[deep wading]] trunking and the A30 was unable to participate in the landings; Challenger crews had to wait until the [[Mulberry harbour]]s were built and ports captured. The Challenger and Firefly, equipped with 17-pounder, were added to tank squadrons to deal with opposing heavy tanks and many Challengers were issued to reconnaissance units using Cromwells. It was initially used by the [[Guards Armoured Division]] and the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]], with about sixteen vehicles in each unit. The latter division phased the type out from February 1945 onwards, while it was being introduced to the Cromwell units of the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]]. The tank was unpopular at first, with crews complaining about the lack of armour, the high silhouette and the tracks being thrown.<ref>Note from Service Engineer, 15.11.44; AA.2/JB.11.11.44</ref> The track problem was caused by the smaller idler wheels compared to the Cromwell; these were in August replaced by idlers with a standard diameter. Troops used to the low profile of the Crusader and Cromwell found the height a serious problem, although it was still shorter than the comparable Sherman Firefly.\n\nConfidence in the vehicle grew and it became preferred over the Firefly, being lower, faster and more manoeuvrable but the early bad reputation persisted with others.<ref>The Rolls Royce Meteor - Cromwell and other applications; Historical Series No. 35 published by the Rolls Royce Heritage Trust</ref> Allied forces were issued with the Challenger, the [[1st Polish Armoured Division]] receiving several in mid-1945 and the [[1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade]] used it during the [[Siege_of_Dunkirk_(1944\u201345)|siege of Dunkirk in late 1944.]]<ref>Hayward ''The Other Challenger'' quoting Six Monthly RAC Progress Reports</ref>{{sfnp|Fletcher|2006|p=47}} After the war, the Czechoslovak government purchased 22 Challengers from the brigade inventory, which served in the Czechoslovak army (first with the 11th, later 23rd, Tank Brigade and then with the 13th Independent Tank Battalion) until they were put in reserve in 1951 and scrapped in 1959.<ref>{{cite book |last= Francev|first= Vladim\u00edr|title=\u010ceskoslovensk\u00e9 tankov\u00e9 s\u00edly 1945-1992 |year=2012 |publisher=Grada |location=Prague |isbn=9788024740294 |page=186}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n'''A30 Avenger SP2''' or '''SP 17pdr, A30 (Avenger)''' was a development of Challenger to be used as a self-propelled gun. It removed the second loader's position and featured a much lower profile turret and lower superstructure on the hull. An additional stowage bin was provided on the glacis plate for a large camo net and return rollers were added to the tracks.{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}\n\nAvenger featured a permanent opening in the turret roof covered with an armoured cover supported a few inches above. This provided the commander and loader with full 360 degree visibility.{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}<!-- note that the open top without cover is the prototype - please don't confuse this with a production vehicle -->\n\nAs many as 500 vehicles appear to have been planned and 230 vehicles were ordered from BRC&W, but this dropped to 80 with the end of the war. It is not known how many were actually built; the SP2 nomenclature indicates its production with the [[Valentine Archer]] (SP1) and [[Alecto (SPG)|Alecto]] (SP3).{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}\n\nAvenger suffered in trials as the engine had to remain running to run the turret traverse motor, because the noise and exhaust could give the vehicle away. Winter trials in a prolonged stationary position also failed in comparison with Archer, when Avenger's steering failed. Both vehicles had problems with camouflage. The vehicle was dropped from trials in 1950, along with removal of Achilles, its US derived equivalent.{{sfnp|Royall|2000}}\n\nWhile the Avenger was only used for trials and was ultimately unsuccessful as a self-propelled artillery piece, in comparison with the purpose built vehicles, it provides an interesting example of what could have been possible for the Challenger tank had it not been forced to accommodate the second loader and larger turret during the tank design. This is highlighted in Robotham's memoirs, indicating that it may have been corrected had design effort not moved to the Comet.{{sfnp|Robotham|1970}}\n\n==Survivors==\n[[File:A30 Challenger pic2.JPG|thumb|A30 Challenger, [[Overloon War Museum]]]]\nTwo vehicles survive, one at the [[Overloon War Museum]] in the Netherlands, acquired from the [[Muzeeaquarium Delfzijl]] in 1976; the other was awaiting restoration at the Isle of Wight Military Museum in the United Kingdom until its closure.
