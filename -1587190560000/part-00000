The group\u2014without R\u2014is the '''aldehyde group''', also known as the '''formyl group'''.  Aldehydes are common in [[organic chemistry]], and many [[fragrance]]s are or contain aldehydes.\n<!--\nstd fxnl group org:\nNomenclature\nStructure and bonding\nPhysical properties and characterization\nApplications and occurrence\nPreparation\nReactions-->\n\n==Structure and bonding==\nAldehydes feature an sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized, planar carbon center that is connected by a double bond to oxygen and a single bond to hydrogen. The C\u2013H bond is not ordinarily acidic. Because of resonance stabilization of the conjugate base, an [[alpha hydrogen|\u03b1-hydrogen]] in an aldehyde (not shown in the picture above) is far more [[acid]]ic, with a [[pKa|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]] near 17, compared to the acidity of a typical [[alkane]] (p''K''<sub>a</sub> about 50).<ref>[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/02/chemistry-of-enolates-and-enols-acidity-of-alpha-hydrogens/ Chemistry of Enols and Enolates \u2013 Acidity of alpha-hydrogens].</ref> This acidification is attributed to (i) the electron-withdrawing quality of the formyl center and (ii) the fact that the conjugate base, an [[enolate]] anion, delocalizes its negative charge. Related to (i), the aldehyde group is somewhat [[polar molecule|polar]].  The formyl proton itself does not readily undergo deprotonation.  The anionic species formally derived from deprotonation of an aldehyde proton, known as an acyl anion, is highly unstable and must be kept at low temperatures.  In fact, with the exception of certain hindered dialkylformamides, the synthesis of acyl anions by direct deprotonation is not a feasible route, since the deprotonated species will almost immediately add to the highly reactive carbonyl of the starting material to form an [[acyloin]] compound.  For this reason, the acidity of the formyl proton is difficult to measure.  In the case of HCON<sup>i</sup>Pr<sub>2</sub>, the acidity of the formyl group was found to be very close to that of diisopropylamine (p''K''<sub>a</sub> ~ 36).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fraser |first=Robert R. |last2=Hubert |first2=Patrick R. |date=January 1974 |title=Direct Formation of the Carbonyl Anion of Diisopropyl Formamide |journal=Canadian Journal of Chemistry |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=185\u2013187 |doi=10.1139/v74-029 |issn=0008-4042}}</ref>  The gas-phase acidity of formaldehyde was found to be {{cvt|393|kcal/mol|kJ/mol|order=flip}}, making it more acidic than hydrogen ({{cvt|400|kcal/mol|kJ/mol|order=flip|disp=comma}}) and ammonia ({{cvt|402|kcal/mol|kJ/mol|order=flip|disp=comma}}), but less acidic than water ({{cvt|390|kcal/mol|kJ/mol|order=flip|disp=comma}}) in the gas phase.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ervin |first=Kent M. |last2=DeTuri |first2=Vincent F. |date=October 2002 |title=Anchoring the Gas-Phase Acidity Scale |journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A |language=en |volume=106 |issue=42 |pages=9947\u20139956 |doi=10.1021/jp020594n |issn=1089-5639}}</ref>  \n\nAldehydes (except those without an alpha carbon, or without protons on the alpha carbon, such as formaldehyde and benzaldehyde) can exist in either the keto or the [[enol]] [[tautomer]]. [[Keto\u2013enol tautomerism]] is catalyzed by either acid or base. Usually the enol is the minority tautomer, but it is more reactive.\n\nAt around {{cvt|85|kcal/mol|kJ/mol|order=flip}}, the formyl C\u2013H bond is weaker than that of a typical bond between hydrogen and an sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon.  Thus aldehydes are prone to undergo hydrogen-atom abstraction in the presence of free radicals, a fact accounts for the ease with which aldehydes undergo [[autoxidation]].\n\nNaming of aldehyded\n\n===IUPAC names for aldehydes===\nThe common names for aldehydes do not strictly follow official guidelines, such as those recommended by [[IUPAC]], but these rules are useful. IUPAC prescribes the following nomenclature for aldehydes:<ref>[http://www.uwc.edu/dept/chemistry/helpful_files/nomenclature.pdf Short Summary of IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901144219/http://www.uwc.edu/dept/chemistry/helpful_files/nomenclature.pdf |date=2006-09-01 }}, web page, University of Wisconsin Colleges, accessed on line August 4, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_449.htm \u00a7R-5.6.1, Aldehydes, thioaldehydes, and their analogues, A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds: recommendations 1993], IUPAC, Commission on Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, Blackwell Scientific, 1993.</ref><ref>[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_480.htm \u00a7R-5.7.1, Carboxylic acids, A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds: recommendations 1993], IUPAC, Commission on Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, Blackwell Scientific, 1993.</ref>\n# Acyclic [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] aldehydes are named as derivatives of the longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde group. Thus, HCHO is named as a derivative of methane, and CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO is named as a derivative of [[butane]]. The name is formed by changing the suffix ''-e'' of the parent [[alkane]] to ''-al'', so that HCHO is named ''[[methanal]]'', and CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO is named ''[[butyraldehyde|butanal]]''.\n# In other cases, such as when a -CHO group is attached to a ring, the suffix ''-carbaldehyde'' may be used. Thus, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>11</sub>CHO is known as ''cyclohexanecarbaldehyde''. If the presence of another functional group demands the use of a suffix, the aldehyde group is named with the prefix ''formyl-''. This prefix is preferred to ''methanoyl-''.\n# If the compound is a natural product or a [[carboxylic acid]], the prefix ''oxo-'' may be used to indicate which carbon atom is part of the aldehyde group; for example, CHOCH<sub>2</sub>COOH is named ''3-oxopropanoic acid''.\n# If replacing the aldehyde group with a [[carboxyl group]] (\u2212COOH) would yield a carboxylic acid with a trivial name, the aldehyde may be named by replacing the suffix ''-ic acid'' or ''-oic acid'' in this trivial name by ''-aldehyde''.\n\n===Etymology===\n[[File:Formic acid.svg|thumb|[[Formic acid]]]]\nThe word ''aldehyde'' was coined by [[Justus von Liebig]] as a contraction of the Latin {{lang|la|'''al'''cohol '''dehyd'''rogenatus}} (dehydrogenated alcohol).<ref>Liebig, J. (1835) [https://books.google.com/books?id=85c5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA289#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Sur les produits de l'oxidation de l'alcool\"] (On the products of the oxidation of alcohol), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', '''59''' : 289\u2013327. From page 290: \"Je le d\u00e9crirai dans ce m\u00e9moire sous le nom ''d'aldehyde'' ; ce nom est form\u00e9 de ''alcool dehydrogenatus''.\" (I will describe it in this memoir by the name of ''aldehyde''; this name is formed from ''alcohol dehydrogenatus''.)</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Crosland |first=Maurice P. |title=Historical Studies in the Language of Chemistry |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kwQQaltqByAC&pg=PA297&dq=alcohol+dehydrogenatus#v=onepage&q=alcohol%20dehydrogenatus&f=false |isbn=9780486438023}}.</ref> In the past, aldehydes were sometimes named after the corresponding [[alcohol]]s, for example, ''vinous aldehyde'' for [[acetaldehyde]]. (''Vinous'' is from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|vinum}} \"wine\", the traditional source of [[ethanol]], cognate with ''[[Vinyl group|vinyl]]''.)\n\nThe term ''formyl group'' is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word {{lang|la|formica}} \"ant\". This word can be recognized in the simplest aldehyde, [[formaldehyde]] (structure shown at top of article), and in the simplest carboxylic acid, [[formic acid]] (structure shown at right).\n\n==Physical properties and characterization==\nAldehydes have properties that are diverse and that depend on the remainder of the molecule. Smaller aldehydes are more soluble in water, [[formaldehyde]] and [[acetaldehyde]] completely so. The volatile aldehydes have pungent odors. \n\nAldehydes, particularly arylaldehydes, degrade in air via the process of [[autoxidation]].  The acyl hydroperoxide is generated, which comproportionates with the starting material to generate two equivalents of the carboxylic acid.  Old bottles of benzaldehyde, a liquid, will often accumulate a crusty solid on the bottle cap or even suspended in the bulk liquid.  This material is benzoic acid, which can be removed by using a base wash followed by distillation.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe two aldehydes of greatest importance in industry, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, have complicated behavior because of their tendency to [[oligomer]]ize or polymerize. Formaldehyde in particular is sold as the polymer [[paraformaldehyde]] ((CH<sub>2</sub>O)''<sub>n</sub>'', typically ''n'' = 50 to 100) as well as the trimer [[1,3,5-Trioxane|1,3,5-trioxane]] (metaformaldehyde).  In addition to the inconveniently low-boiling monomer (b.p. 21 \u00b0C), acetaldehyde is available as the trimer paraldehyde (a sedative and [[anticonvulsant]]) and tetramer [[metaldehyde]] (a slug and snail poison).  In general, higher aliphatic aldehydes will accumulate a substantial amount of oligomer (mostly trimer) upon long-term storage and must be freshly distilled when a reaction calls for the monomeric starting material.  They also tend to hydrate, forming the [[geminal diol]]. Formaldehyde is often sold as the aqueous solution, formalin, which is mostly 1,1-methanediol, with a small amount of methanol added as stabilizer.  The oligomers/polymers and the hydrates exist in equilibrium with the parent aldehyde, and for ''some'' synthetic procedures, they can serve as substitutes for the anhydrous monomer.\n\nAldehydes are readily identified by spectroscopic methods. Using [[IR spectroscopy]], they display a strong ''\u03bd''<sub>CO</sub> band near 1700&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. In their <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra, the formyl hydrogen center absorbs near ''\u03b4''<sub>H</sub>&nbsp;9.5 to 10, which is a distinctive part of the spectrum. This signal shows the characteristic coupling to any protons on the \u03b1 carbon with a small coupling constant typically less than 3.0 Hz.  The <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of aldehydes and ketones gives a suppressed (weak) but distinctive signal at ''\u03b4''<sub>C</sub>&nbsp;190 to 205.\n\n==Applications and occurrence==\n[[File:Important Aldehyde Structures.svg|thumb|center|830px]] Important aldehydes and related compounds. The '''aldehyde group''' (or '''formyl group''') is colored red.  From the left: (1) [[formaldehyde]] and (2) its trimer [[1,3,5-Trioxane|1,3,5-trioxane]], (3) [[acetaldehyde]] and (4) its enol [[vinyl alcohol]], (5) [[glucose]] (pyranose form as \u03b1-{{sc|D}}-glucopyranose), (6) the flavorant [[cinnamaldehyde]],  (7) the visual pigment [[retinal]], and (8) the vitamin [[pyridoxal]].\n\n===Naturally occurring aldehydes===\nTraces of many aldehydes are found in [[essential oil]]s and often contribute to their favorable odors, e.g. [[cinnamaldehyde]], [[cilantro]], and [[vanillin]]. Possibly because of the high reactivity of the formyl group, aldehydes are not common in several of the natural building blocks: amino acids, nucleic acids, lipids. Most sugars, however, are derivatives of aldehydes. These [[aldose]]s exist as [[hemiacetal]]s, a sort of masked form of the parent aldehyde. For example, in aqueous solution only a tiny fraction of glucose exists as the aldehyde.\n\n==Synthesis==<!--A reaction that introduces an aldehyde group is known as a ''[[formylation reaction]]''.\n-->\nThere are several methods for preparing aldehydes,<ref name=\"March\">{{March6th}}</ref> but the dominant technology is [[hydroformylation]].<ref name=\"Bertleff\">Bertleff, W.; Roeper, M. and Sava, X.

In industry, formaldehyde is produced on a large scale by oxidation of methanol.<ref name=CH2O/> Oxygen is the reagent of choice, being \"green\" and cheap. In the laboratory, more specialized [[oxidizing agent]]s are used, but chromium(VI) reagents are popular. Oxidation can be achieved by heating the alcohol with an acidified solution of [[potassium dichromate]]. In this case, excess [[dichromate]] will further oxidize the aldehyde to a [[carboxylic acid]], so either the aldehyde is [[distillation|distilled]] out as it forms (if [[Vapor pressure|volatile]]) or milder reagents such as [[pyridinium chlorochromate|PCC]] are used.<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = Ratcliffe, R.

From the biological perspective, the key reactions involve addition of nucleophiles to the formyl carbon in the formation of imines (oxidative deamination) and hemiacetals (structures of aldose sugars).<ref name=\"March\"/>\n\n===Reduction===\n{{Main|Aldehyde reduction}}\nThe formyl group can be readily reduced to a [[primary alcohol]] (\u2212CH<sub>2</sub>OH). Typically this conversion is accomplished by catalytic [[hydrogenation]] either directly or by [[transfer hydrogenation]]. [[Stoichiometry|Stoichiometric]] reductions are also popular, as can be effected with [[sodium borohydride]].\n\n===Oxidation===\nThe formyl group readily oxidizes to the corresponding [[carboxyl group]] (\u2212COOH). The preferred oxidant in industry is oxygen or air. In the laboratory, popular oxidizing agents include [[potassium permanganate]], [[nitric acid]], [[Chromium trioxide|chromium(VI) oxide]], and [[chromic acid]]. The combination of [[manganese dioxide]], [[cyanide]], [[acetic acid]] and [[methanol]] will convert the aldehyde to a methyl [[ester]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=New methods for the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids and esters |author1-link=Elias J.

In this test, an aldehyde is treated with [[Tollens' reagent]], which is prepared by adding a drop of [[sodium hydroxide]] solution into [[silver nitrate]] solution to give a precipitate of silver(I) oxide, and then adding just enough dilute [[ammonia]] solution to redissolve the precipitate in aqueous ammonia to produce [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> complex. This reagent converts aldehydes to carboxylic acids without attacking carbon\u2013carbon double bonds. The name ''silver-mirror test'' arises because this reaction produces a precipitate of silver, whose presence can be used to test for the presence of an aldehyde.\n\nA further oxidation reaction involves [[Fehling's reagent]] as a test. The Cu<sup>2+</sup> complex ions are reduced to a red-brick-coloured [[Copper(I) oxide|Cu<sub>2</sub>O]] precipitate.\n\nIf the aldehyde cannot form an enolate (e.g., [[benzaldehyde]]), addition of strong base induces the [[Cannizzaro reaction]]. This reaction results in [[disproportionation]], producing a mixture of alcohol and carboxylic acid.\n\n===Nucleophilic addition reactions===\n[[Nucleophile]]s add readily to the carbonyl group. In the product, the carbonyl carbon becomes sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized, being bonded to the nucleophile, and the oxygen center becomes protonated:\n: RCHO + Nu<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 RCH(Nu)O<sup>\u2212</sup>\n: RCH(Nu)O<sup>\u2212</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> \u2192 RCH(Nu)OH\n\nIn many cases, a water molecule is removed after the addition takes place; in this case, the reaction is classed as an [[addition reaction|addition]]\u2013[[elimination reaction|elimination]] or [[addition reaction|addition]]\u2013[[condensation reaction]]. There are many variations of nucleophilic addition reactions.\n\n====Oxygen nucleophiles====\nIn the [[acetalisation]] reaction, under [[acid]]ic or [[base (chemistry)|basic]] conditions, an [[alcohol]] adds to the carbonyl group and a proton is transferred to form a [[hemiacetal]]. Under [[acid]]ic conditions, the hemiacetal and the alcohol can further react to form an [[acetal]] and water. Simple hemiacetals are usually unstable, although cyclic ones such as [[glucose]] can be stable. Acetals are stable, but revert to the aldehyde in the presence of acid. Aldehydes can react with water to form [[hydrate]]s, R\u2212CH(OH)<sub>2</sub>. These diols are stable when strong [[electron withdrawing group]]s are present, as in [[chloral hydrate]]. The mechanism of formation is identical to hemiacetal formation.\n\n====Nitrogen nucleophiles====\nIn [[alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution]], a primary or secondary amine adds to the carbonyl group and a proton is transferred from the nitrogen to the oxygen atom to create a [[carbinolamine]]. In the case of a primary amine, a water molecule can be eliminated from the carbinolamine intermediate to yield an [[imine]] or its trimer, a [[hexahydrotriazine]] This reaction is catalyzed by acid. [[Hydroxylamine]] (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) can also add to the carbonyl group. After the elimination of water, this results in an [[oxime]]. An [[ammonia]] derivative of the form H<sub>2</sub>NNR<sub>2</sub> such as [[hydrazine]] (H<sub>2</sub>NNH<sub>2</sub>) or [[2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine]] can also be the nucleophile and after the elimination of water, resulting in the formation of a [[hydrazone]], which are usually orange crystalline solids. This reaction forms the basis of a test for aldehydes and [[ketones]].<ref name=Fuson/>\n\n====Carbon nucleophiles====\nThe [[Cyanide|cyano]] group in [[Hydrogen cyanide|HCN]] can add to the carbonyl group to form [[cyanohydrin]]s, R\u2212CH(OH)CN. In this reaction the CN<sup>\u2212</sup> ion is the [[nucleophile]] that attacks the partially positive carbon atom of the [[Carboxyl group|carbonyl group]]. The mechanism involves a pair of electrons from the carbonyl-group double bond transferring to the oxygen atom, leaving it single-bonded to carbon and giving the oxygen atom a negative charge. This intermediate ion rapidly reacts with H<sup>+</sup>, such as from the HCN molecule, to form the alcohol group of the cyanohydrin.\n\n[[Organometallic chemistry|Organometallic compounds]], such as [[organolithium reagent]]s, [[Grignard reagent]]s, or [[acetylide]]s, undergo [[nucleophilic addition]] reactions, yielding a substituted alcohol group. Related reactions include [[organostannane addition]]s, [[Barbier reaction]]s, and the [[Nozaki\u2013Hiyama\u2013Kishi reaction]].\n\nIn the [[aldol reaction]], the metal [[enolates]] of [[ketone]]s, [[ester]]s, [[amide]]s, and [[carboxylic acids]] add to aldehydes to form \u03b2-hydroxycarbonyl compounds ([[aldol]]s). Acid or base-catalyzed dehydration then leads to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The combination of these two steps is known as the [[aldol condensation]].\n\nThe [[Prins reaction]] occurs when a nucleophilic [[alkene]] or [[alkyne]] reacts with an aldehyde as electrophile. The product of the Prins reaction varies with reaction conditions and substrates employed.\n\n====Bisulfite reaction====\nAldehydes characteristically form \"addition compounds\" with sodium bisulfite:\n: RCHO + {{chem|HSO|3|\u2212}} \u2192 {{chem|RCH(OH)SO|3|\u2212}}\nThis reaction is used as a test for aldehydes.<ref name=Fuson>{{cite book |title=The Systematic Identification of Organic Compounds |first1=R.

The nomenclature of dialdehydes have the ending ''-dial'' or sometimes ''-dialdehyde''. Short aliphatic dialdehydes are sometimes named after the [[diacid]] from which they can be derived. An example is [[Succindialdehyde|butanedial]], which is also called succinaldehyde (from [[succinic acid]]).\n\n==Biochemistry==\nSome aldehydes are substrates for [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] [[enzyme]]s which metabolize aldehydes in the body.

The C\u2013H bond is not ordinarily acidic. Because of resonance stabilization of the conjugate base, an [[alpha hydrogen|\u03b1-hydrogen]] in an aldehyde (not shown in the picture above) is far more [[acid]]ic, with a [[pKa|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]] near 17, compared to the acidity of a typical [[alkane]] (p''K''<sub>a</sub> about 50).<ref>[http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2011/02/chemistry-of-enolates-and-enols-acidity-of-alpha-hydrogens/ Chemistry of Enols and Enolates \u2013 Acidity of alpha-hydrogens].</ref> This acidification is attributed to (i) the electron-withdrawing quality of the formyl center and (ii) the fact that the conjugate base, an [[enolate]] anion, delocalizes its negative charge. Related to (i), the aldehyde group is somewhat [[polar molecule|polar]].  The formyl proton itself does not readily undergo deprotonation.  The anionic species formally derived from deprotonation of an aldehyde proton, known as an acyl anion, is highly unstable and must be kept at low temperatures.  In fact, with the exception of certain hindered dialkylformamides, the synthesis of acyl anions by direct deprotonation is not a feasible route, since the deprotonated species will almost immediately add to the highly reactive carbonyl of the starting material to form an [[acyloin]] compound.  For this reason, the acidity of the formyl proton is difficult to measure.  In the case of HCON<sup>i</sup>Pr<sub>2</sub>, the acidity of the formyl group was found to be very close to that of diisopropylamine (p''K''<sub>a</sub> ~ 36).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Fraser |first=Robert R. |last2=Hubert |first2=Patrick R. |date=January 1974 |title=Direct Formation of the Carbonyl Anion of Diisopropyl Formamide |journal=Canadian Journal of Chemistry |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=185\u2013187 |doi=10.1139/v74-029 |issn=0008-4042}}</ref>  The gas-phase acidity of formaldehyde was found to be {{cvt|393|kcal/mol|kJ/mol|order=flip}}, making it more acidic than hydrogen ({{cvt|400|kcal/mol|kJ/mol|order=flip|disp=comma}}) and ammonia ({{cvt|402|kcal/mol|kJ/mol|order=flip|disp=comma}}), but less acidic than water ({{cvt|390|kcal/mol|kJ/mol|order=flip|disp=comma}}) in the gas phase.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ervin |first=Kent M. |last2=DeTuri |first2=Vincent F. |date=October 2002 |title=Anchoring the Gas-Phase Acidity Scale |journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry A |language=en |volume=106 |issue=42 |pages=9947\u20139956 |doi=10.1021/jp020594n |issn=1089-5639}}</ref>  \n\nAldehydes (except those without an alpha carbon, or without protons on the alpha carbon, such as formaldehyde and benzaldehyde) can exist in either the keto or the [[enol]] [[tautomer]]. [[Keto\u2013enol tautomerism]] is catalyzed by either acid or base. Usually the enol is the minority tautomer, but it is more reactive.\n\nAt around {{cvt|85|kcal/mol|kJ/mol|order=flip}}, the formyl C\u2013H bond is weaker than that of a typical bond between hydrogen and an sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon.  Thus aldehydes are prone to undergo hydrogen-atom abstraction in the presence of free radicals, a fact accounts for the ease with which aldehydes undergo [[autoxidation]].\n\n==Nomenclature==\n\n===IUPAC names for aldehydes===\nThe common names for aldehydes do not strictly follow official guidelines, such as those recommended by [[IUPAC]], but these rules are useful. IUPAC prescribes the following nomenclature for aldehydes:<ref>[http://www.uwc.edu/dept/chemistry/helpful_files/nomenclature.pdf Short Summary of IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901144219/http://www.uwc.edu/dept/chemistry/helpful_files/nomenclature.pdf |date=2006-09-01 }}, web page, University of Wisconsin Colleges, accessed on line August 4, 2007.</ref><ref>[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_449.htm \u00a7R-5.6.1, Aldehydes, thioaldehydes, and their analogues, A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds: recommendations 1993], IUPAC, Commission on Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, Blackwell Scientific, 1993.</ref><ref>[http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_480.htm \u00a7R-5.7.1, Carboxylic acids, A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds: recommendations 1993], IUPAC, Commission on Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry, Blackwell Scientific, 1993.</ref>\n# Acyclic [[aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] aldehydes are named as derivatives of the longest carbon chain containing the aldehyde group. Thus, HCHO is named as a derivative of methane, and CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO is named as a derivative of [[butane]]. The name is formed by changing the suffix ''-e'' of the parent [[alkane]] to ''-al'', so that HCHO is named ''[[methanal]]'', and CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CHO is named ''[[butyraldehyde|butanal]]''.\n# In other cases, such as when a -CHO group is attached to a ring, the suffix ''-carbaldehyde'' may be used. Thus, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>11</sub>CHO is known as ''cyclohexanecarbaldehyde''. If the presence of another functional group demands the use of a suffix, the aldehyde group is named with the prefix ''formyl-''. This prefix is preferred to ''methanoyl-''.\n# If the compound is a natural product or a [[carboxylic acid]], the prefix ''oxo-'' may be used to indicate which carbon atom is part of the aldehyde group; for example, CHOCH<sub>2</sub>COOH is named ''3-oxopropanoic acid''.\n# If replacing the aldehyde group with a [[carboxyl group]] (\u2212COOH) would yield a carboxylic acid with a trivial name, the aldehyde may be named by replacing the suffix ''-ic acid'' or ''-oic acid'' in this trivial name by ''-aldehyde''.\n\n===Etymology===\n[[File:Formic acid.svg|thumb|[[Formic acid]]]]\nThe word ''aldehyde'' was coined by [[Justus von Liebig]] as a contraction of the Latin {{lang|la|'''al'''cohol '''dehyd'''rogenatus}} (dehydrogenated alcohol).<ref>Liebig, J. (1835) [https://books.google.com/books?id=85c5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA289#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Sur les produits de l'oxidation de l'alcool\"] (On the products of the oxidation of alcohol), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', '''59''' : 289\u2013327.

(''Vinous'' is from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|vinum}} \"wine\", the traditional source of [[ethanol]], cognate with ''[[Vinyl group|vinyl]]''.)\n\nThe term ''formyl group'' is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word {{lang|la|formica}} \"ant\". This word can be recognized in the simplest aldehyde, [[formaldehyde]] (structure shown at top of article), and in the simplest carboxylic acid, [[formic acid]] (structure shown at right).\n\n==Physical properties and characterization==\nAldehydes have properties that are diverse and that depend on the remainder of the molecule. Smaller aldehydes are more soluble in water, [[formaldehyde]] and [[acetaldehyde]] completely so. The volatile aldehydes have pungent odors. \n\nAldehydes, particularly arylaldehydes, degrade in air via the process of [[autoxidation]].  The acyl hydroperoxide is generated, which comproportionates with the starting material to generate two equivalents of the carboxylic acid.  Old bottles of benzaldehyde, a liquid, will often accumulate a crusty solid on the bottle cap or even suspended in the bulk liquid.  This material is benzoic acid, which can be removed by using a base wash followed by distillation.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe two aldehydes of greatest importance in industry, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, have complicated behavior because of their tendency to [[oligomer]]ize or polymerize. Formaldehyde in particular is sold as the polymer [[paraformaldehyde]] ((CH<sub>2</sub>O)''<sub>n</sub>'', typically ''n'' = 50 to 100) as well as the trimer [[1,3,5-Trioxane|1,3,5-trioxane]] (metaformaldehyde).  In addition to the inconveniently low-boiling monomer (b.p. 21 \u00b0C), acetaldehyde is available as the trimer paraldehyde (a sedative and [[anticonvulsant]]) and tetramer [[metaldehyde]] (a slug and snail poison).  In general, higher aliphatic aldehydes will accumulate a substantial amount of oligomer (mostly trimer) upon long-term storage and must be freshly distilled when a reaction calls for the monomeric starting material.  They also tend to hydrate, forming the [[geminal diol]]. Formaldehyde is often sold as the aqueous solution, formalin, which is mostly 1,1-methanediol, with a small amount of methanol added as stabilizer.  The oligomers/polymers and the hydrates exist in equilibrium with the parent aldehyde, and for ''some'' synthetic procedures, they can serve as substitutes for the anhydrous monomer.\n\nAldehydes are readily identified by spectroscopic methods. Using [[IR spectroscopy]], they display a strong ''\u03bd''<sub>CO</sub> band near 1700&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. In their <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra, the formyl hydrogen center absorbs near ''\u03b4''<sub>H</sub>&nbsp;9.5 to 10, which is a distinctive part of the spectrum. This signal shows the characteristic coupling to any protons on the \u03b1 carbon with a small coupling constant typically less than 3.0 Hz.  The <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra of aldehydes and ketones gives a suppressed (weak) but distinctive signal at ''\u03b4''<sub>C</sub>&nbsp;190 to 205.\n\n==Applications and occurrence==\n[[File:Important Aldehyde Structures.svg|thumb|center|830px]] Important aldehydes and related compounds. The '''aldehyde group''' (or '''formyl group''') is colored red.  From the left: (1) [[formaldehyde]] and (2) its trimer [[1,3,5-Trioxane|1,3,5-trioxane]], (3) [[acetaldehyde]] and (4) its enol [[vinyl alcohol]], (5) [[glucose]] (pyranose form as \u03b1-{{sc|D}}-glucopyranose), (6) the flavorant [[cinnamaldehyde]],  (7) the visual pigment [[retinal]], and (8) the vitamin [[pyridoxal]].\n\n===Naturally occurring aldehydes===\nTraces of many aldehydes are found in [[essential oil]]s and often contribute to their favorable odors, e.g. [[cinnamaldehyde]], [[cilantro]], and [[vanillin]]. Possibly because of the high reactivity of the formyl group, aldehydes are not common in several of the natural building blocks: amino acids, nucleic acids, lipids. Most sugars, however, are derivatives of aldehydes. These [[aldose]]s exist as [[hemiacetal]]s, a sort of masked form of the parent aldehyde. For example, in aqueous solution only a tiny fraction of glucose exists as the aldehyde.\n\n==Synthesis==<!--A reaction that introduces an aldehyde group is known as a ''[[formylation reaction]]''.\n-->\nThere are several methods for preparing aldehydes,<ref name=\"March\">{{March6th}}</ref> but the dominant technology is [[hydroformylation]].<ref name=\"Bertleff\">Bertleff, W.; Roeper, M. and Sava, X.

In this test, an aldehyde is treated with [[Tollens' reagent]], which is prepared by adding a drop of [[sodium hydroxide]] solution into [[silver nitrate]] solution to give a precipitate of silver(I) oxide, and then adding just enough dilute [[ammonia]] solution to redissolve the precipitate in aqueous ammonia to produce [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup> complex. This reagent converts aldehydes to carboxylic acids without attacking carbon\u2013carbon double bonds. The name ''silver-mirror test'' arises because this reaction produces a precipitate of silver, whose presence can be used to test for the presence of an aldehyde.\n\nA further oxidation reaction involves [[Fehling's reagent]] as a test. The Cu<sup>2+</sup> complex ions are reduced to a red-brick-coloured [[Copper(I) oxide|Cu<sub>2</sub>O]] precipitate.\n\nIf the aldehyde cannot form an enolate (e.g., [[benzaldehyde]]), addition of strong base induces the [[Cannizzaro reaction]]. This reaction results in [[disproportionation]], producing a mixture of alcohol and carboxylic acid.\n\n===Nucleophilic addition reactions===\n[[Nucleophile]]s add readily to the carbonyl group. In the product, the carbonyl carbon becomes sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridized, being bonded to the nucleophile, and the oxygen center becomes protonated:\n: RCHO + Nu<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 RCH(Nu)O<sup>\u2212</sup>\n: RCH(Nu)O<sup>\u2212</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> \u2192 RCH(Nu)OH\n\nIn many cases, a water molecule is removed after the addition takes place; in this case, the reaction is classed as an [[addition reaction|addition]]\u2013[[elimination reaction|elimination]] or [[addition reaction|addition]]\u2013[[condensation reaction]]. There are many variations of nucleophilic addition reactions.\n\n====Oxygen nucleophiles====\nIn the [[acetalisation]] reaction, under [[acid]]ic or [[base (chemistry)|basic]] conditions, an [[alcohol]] adds to the carbonyl group and a proton is transferred to form a [[hemiacetal]]. Under [[acid]]ic conditions, the hemiacetal and the alcohol can further react to form an [[acetal]] and water. Simple hemiacetals are usually unstable, although cyclic ones such as [[glucose]] can be stable. Acetals are stable, but revert to the aldehyde in the presence of acid. Aldehydes can react with water to form [[hydrate]]s, R\u2212CH(OH)<sub>2</sub>. These diols are stable when strong [[electron withdrawing group]]s are present, as in [[chloral hydrate]]. The mechanism of formation is identical to hemiacetal formation.\n\n====Nitrogen nucleophiles====\nIn [[alkylimino-de-oxo-bisubstitution]], a primary or secondary amine adds to the carbonyl group and a proton is transferred from the nitrogen to the oxygen atom to create a [[carbinolamine]]. In the case of a primary amine, a water molecule can be eliminated from the carbinolamine intermediate to yield an [[imine]] or its trimer, a [[hexahydrotriazine]] This reaction is catalyzed by acid. [[Hydroxylamine]] (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) can also add to the carbonyl group. After the elimination of water, this results in an [[oxime]]. An [[ammonia]] derivative of the form H<sub>2</sub>NNR<sub>2</sub> such as [[hydrazine]] (H<sub>2</sub>NNH<sub>2</sub>) or [[2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine]] can also be the nucleophile and after the elimination of water, resulting in the formation of a [[hydrazone]], which are usually orange crystalline solids. This reaction forms the basis of a test for aldehydes and [[ketones]].<ref name=Fuson/>\n\n====Carbon nucleophiles====\nThe [[Cyanide|cyano]] group in [[Hydrogen cyanide|HCN]] can add to the carbonyl group to form [[cyanohydrin]]s, R\u2212CH(OH)CN. In this reaction the CN<sup>\u2212</sup> ion is the [[nucleophile]] that attacks the partially positive carbon atom of the [[Carboxyl group|carbonyl group]]. The mechanism involves a pair of electrons from the carbonyl-group double bond transferring to the oxygen atom, leaving it single-bonded to carbon and giving the oxygen atom a negative charge. This intermediate ion rapidly reacts with H<sup>+</sup>, such as from the HCN molecule, to form the alcohol group of the cyanohydrin.\n\n[[Organometallic chemistry|Organometallic compounds]], such as [[organolithium reagent]]s, [[Grignard reagent]]s, or [[acetylide]]s, undergo [[nucleophilic addition]] reactions, yielding a substituted alcohol group. Related reactions include [[organostannane addition]]s, [[Barbier reaction]]s, and the [[Nozaki\u2013Hiyama\u2013Kishi reaction]].\n\nIn the [[aldol reaction]], the metal [[enolates]] of [[ketone]]s, [[ester]]s, [[amide]]s, and [[carboxylic acids]] add to aldehydes to form \u03b2-hydroxycarbonyl compounds ([[aldol]]s). Acid or base-catalyzed dehydration then leads to \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The combination of these two steps is known as the [[aldol condensation]].\n\nThe [[Prins reaction]] occurs when a nucleophilic [[alkene]] or [[alkyne]] reacts with an aldehyde as electrophile. The product of the Prins reaction varies with reaction conditions and substrates employed.\n\n====Bisulfite reaction====\nAldehydes characteristically form \"addition compounds\" with sodium bisulfite:\n: RCHO + {{chem|HSO|3|\u2212}} \u2192 {{chem|RCH(OH)SO|3|\u2212}}\nThis reaction is used as a test for aldehydes.<ref name=Fuson>{{cite book |title=The Systematic Identification of Organic Compounds |first1=R.

The nomenclature of dialdehydes have the ending ''-dial'' or sometimes ''-dialdehyde''. Short aliphatic dialdehydes are sometimes named after the [[diacid]] from which they can be derived. An example is [[Succindialdehyde|butanedial]], which is also called succinaldehyde (from [[succinic acid]]).\n\n==Biochemistry==\nSome aldehydes are substrates for [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] [[enzyme]]s which metabolize aldehydes in the body. There are [[Toxicity|toxicities]] associated with some aldehydes that are related to [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease, [[heart disease]], and some types of [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Che-Hong|last2=Ferreira|first2=Julio Cesar Batista|last3=Gross|first3=Eric R.|first4=Daria Mochly|last4=Rosen|title=Targeting Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2: New Therapeutic Opportunities|journal=Physiological Reviews|date=1 January 2014|volume=94|issue=1|pages=1\u201334|doi=10.1152/physrev.00017.2013|pmid=24382882|pmc=3929114}}</ref>\n\n==Examples of aldehydes==\n* [[Formaldehyde]] (methanal)\n* [[Acetaldehyde]] (ethanal)\n* [[Propionaldehyde]] (propanal)\n* [[Butyraldehyde]] (butanal)\n* [[Benzaldehyde]] (phenylmethanal)\n* [[Cinnamaldehyde]]\n* [[Vanillin]]\n* [[Tolualdehyde]]\n* [[Furfural]]\n* [[Retinaldehyde]]\n\n==Examples of dialdehydes==\n* [[Glyoxal]]\n* [[Malondialdehyde]]\n* [[Succindialdehyde]]\n* [[Glutaraldehyde]]\n* [[Phthalaldehyde]]\n\n==Uses==\nOf all aldehydes, formaldehyde is produced on the largest scale, about {{val|6,000,000|u=tons per year}}.

Many other aldehydes find commercial applications, often as precursors to alcohols, the so-called [[oxo alcohol]]s, which are used in detergents. Some aldehydes are produced only on a small scale (less than 1000 tons per year) and are used as ingredients in flavours and [[perfume]]s such as [[Chanel No. 5]].

In July 1909, on only her second voyage, the ship, en route from [[Durban]] to [[Cape Town]], disappeared with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Design and construction==\nIn September 1907 W. Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day. At the time of construction, ''Waratah'' was not equipped with a radio, which was not unusual at the time.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=118|ps=}}\n\nThe sea trials were held on 23 October 1908 on the Firth of Clyde, during which the steamer was able to successfully maintain a mean speed of {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h}} over several runs on the measured mile.

At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n\nThat evening the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"\n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nThe same evening, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw a large steamer coming up astern of her, working hard in the heavy seas and making a great deal of smoke, enough to make her captain wonder if the steamer was on fire.

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under.

Fears started to grow for her safety, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

This passenger, physicist Professor [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]]. When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite.

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n===Paranormal===\nSeveral supernatural theories were also put forward to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah''. Claude Sawyer reported to the London inquiry that he had during the voyage seen on three occasions in dreams the vision of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" He decided that this vision was a warning, and was one of the reasons why he decided not to continue the voyage on the ''Waratah'' and to get off the ship at Durban.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

In July 1909, on only her second voyage, the ship, en route from [[Durban]] to [[Cape Town]], disappeared with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Design and construction==\nIn September 1907 W. Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day. At the time of construction, ''Waratah'' was not equipped with a radio, which was not unusual at the time.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=118|ps=}}\n\nThe sea trials were held on 23 October 1908 on the Firth of Clyde, during which the steamer was able to successfully maintain a mean speed of {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h}} over several runs on the measured mile.

The repairs were performed at Sydney to the chief engineer's satisfaction.\n\nDuring her maiden trip the steamer was scrutinized by the Captain and the crew, as one of the criteria used in acceptance trials was the ship's handling and stability. Captain Ilbery was not completely satisfied and, considering he was previously in charge of ''Geelong'', presumably reported to the owners that the ship did not have the same stability as his old vessel.

At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n\nThat evening the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"\n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nThe same evening, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw a large steamer coming up astern of her, working hard in the heavy seas and making a great deal of smoke, enough to make her captain wonder if the steamer was on fire.

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously.

As ''Waratah'' was considered unsinkable, it was at first thought likely that she had been delayed by a breakdown or mechanical fault, and was still adrift. Fears only started to grow, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

It quickly came to focus on the supposed instability of the ''Waratah''.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=129|ps=}} Evidence was greatly hampered by the lack of any survivors from the ship's final voyage (other than the small number, including Claude Sawyer, who had disembarked in [[Durban]]). Most evidence came from passengers and crew from ''Waratah's'' maiden voyage, her builders and those who had handled her in port.\n\nThe expert witnesses all agreed that the ''Waratah'' was designed and built properly and sailed in good condition.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=130|ps=}} She had passed numerous inspections, including those by her builders, her owners, the Board of Trade and two by [[Lloyd's of London]], who gave her the classification \"+100 A1\"&nbsp;\u2013 their top rating,{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=118, 130|ps=}} granted only to ships Lloyds had inspected and assessed throughout the design, construction, fitting out and [[sea trial]]s, on top of the two valuations and inspections Lloyds had made of the completed ''Waratah''.\n\nHowever many witnesses who had travelled on the ship testified that the ''Waratah'' felt unstable, frequently [[Angle of list|listed]] to one side even in calm conditions, [[Ship motions|rolled]] excessively, and was very slow to come upright after leaning into a swell, and had a tendency for her [[bow (ship)|bow]] to dip into oncoming waves rather than ride over them.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\"/><ref name=\"NLAInqreport\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5235069 |title=THE WARATAH.

When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite. Both former passengers and crew members (ranking from stokers to a deck officer) said the ''Waratah'' was perfectly stable, with a comfortable, easy roll.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=133|ps=}} Many said they felt she was especially stable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5153599 |title=THE S.S.

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n===Paranormal===\nSeveral supernatural theories were also put forward to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah''. Claude Sawyer reported to the London inquiry that he had during the voyage seen on three occasions in dreams the vision of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" He decided that this vision was a warning, and was one of the reasons why he decided not to continue the voyage on the ''Waratah'' and to get off the ship at Durban.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.
