Nehunya ben HaKanah.''''' (\"R. Nehunya ben HaKanah said,\" the opening sentence)\n\nAmong medieval Kabbalists it became known as '''''Sefer HaBahir''''', taken from its opening comment, \"One verse says: 'And now men see not the light which is bright (''bahir'') in the skies'\" ([[Book of Job|Job]] 37:21).\n\n== Authorship ==\nKabbalists ascribed authorship of the ''Bahir'' to R. Nehunya, a rabbi of the Mishnaic era, who lived around 100 CE. Medieval Kabbalists write that the ''Bahir'' did not come down to them as a unified book, but rather in pieces found in scattered scrolls and booklets. The scattered and fragmentary nature of the ''Bahir'''{{'}}s text, which sometimes ends discussion in mid-sentence, and which often jumps randomly from topic to topic, supports this claim.\n\nThe historical critical study of this book points to a later date of composition. For some time scholars believed that it was written in the 13th century by Isaac the Blind, or by those in his school. The first sentence, \"And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies\" (Job 37:21), being isolated, and having no connection with what follows, was taken to be an allusion to the blindness of its author. However, modern scholars of Kabbalah now hold that at least part of the ''Bahir'' was an adaptation of an older work, the ''Sefer Raza Rabba''. This older book is mentioned in some of the works of the [[Geonim]]; however no complete copies of Sefer ''Raza Rabba'' are still in existence. However, quotes from this book can still be found in some older works. Scholar Ronit Meroz argues that elements in the ''Bahir'' date back to 10th century Babylonia, as witnessed by the acceptance of the Babylonian system of [[niqqud|vowel points]], which later fell into disuse, while other elements were written in 12th century Provence.<ref name=meroz07>{{Citation\n |last=Meroz \n |first=Ronit \n |title=The Middle Eastern origins of kabbalah \n |journal=The Journal for the Study of Sephardic and Mizrahi Jewry \n |pages=39\u201356 \n |year=2007 \n |url=http://sephardic.fiu.edu/journal/RonitMeroz.pdf \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629163808/http://sephardic.fiu.edu/journal/RonitMeroz.pdf \n |archivedate=2010-06-29 \n}}</ref>\n\nMany scholars of Kabbalah hold that the ''Bahir'' adds gnostic elements to the older work. The question of how much gnosticism has influenced Kabbalah is one of the major themes of modern-day research on Kabbalah, see the works of [[Gershom Scholem]] and [[Moshe Idel]] for more information.\n:There is a striking affinity between the symbolism of ''Sefer HaBahir'', on the one hand, and the speculations of the Gnostics, and the theory of the \"aeons,\" on the other. The fundamental problem in the study of the book is: is this affinity based on an as yet unknown historical link between the gnosticism of the mishnaic and talmudic era and the sources from which the material in ''Sefer HaBahir'' is derived? Or should it possibly be seen as a purely psychological phenomenon, i.e., as a spontaneous upsurge from the depths of the soul's imagination, without any historical continuity?\n:''Bahir'', ''Encyclopedia Judaica'', Keter Publishing\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Bahir.png|thumb|Title page of ''Bahir'', 1651 edition]]\n* [[Kabbalist]]s believe that oral tradition of the ''Bahir'' goes back to the 1st century CE.

But they saw only part of the book and not all of it because they did not see it in its entirety, in its complete form.\" \n\nSeveral distinct literary layers can be distinguished in the ''Book Bahir'' \u2013 some written in the East at the end of the 9th century or in the early 10th century, and some in 12th century Provence. The Book Bahir's use of the Babylonian grammar and vocalization system (which also reflects a different pronunciation and was widely utilized throughout the East) decisively proves the existence of an Oriental layer. The Babylonian vocalization, as opposed to the Tiberian one used in Hebrew to this day, is mainly upper (that is, marked above the letters) and is characterized, among other properties, by the ''segol'' being pronounced like a ''patah''. Only if the ''Book Bahir'' was written in a region in which the Babylonian system was in use can the claim \"the Lord placed a ''patah'' above (a letter) and a ''segol'' beneath\" be meaningful. The ''patah'' is upper according to the Babylonian vocalization system, whereas the ''segol'' is lower according to the Tiberian system. Only according to the Babylonian system is it possible to pronounce this combination of vowels at the same time, as they both have the same pronunciation (the short u).\n\nThe use of the Babylonian vocalization system to symbolize the Holy is evidence of the passage's date of composition: At the beginning of the 10th century, a debate arose between Jewish communities over which grammatical system most faithfully represented the Torah; in other words, how was it pronounced when it was given to Moses on Mount Sinai? This debate ended with the victory of the Tiberian system and with the understanding that the Babylonian system reflected a foreign influence on the Hebrew language. Thereafter, one could no longer employ it as a proper symbolic instrument for the Holy. Hence, the Babylonian layer must have been written before this debate was concluded.<ref>Ronit Meroz, The Middle Eastern Origins of Kabbalah, ''The Journal for the Study of Sephardic & Mizrahi Jewry'' February 2007, p. 50</ref>\n\n== Contents ==\nThe ''Bahir'' assumes the form of an exegetic [[midrash]] on the first chapters of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. It is divided into sixty short paragraphs or a hundred and forty passages,<ref>https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_01879.html</ref> and is in the form of a dialogue between master and disciples.\n\nThe main characters are \"R. Amora\" (or \"Amorai\"), and \"R. Rahamai\" (or \"Rehumai\"). Some statements in the book are attributed to R. Berechiah, R. Johanan, R. Bun, rabbis mentioned in the later midrashic literature.\n\nThe ''Bahir'' contains commentaries explaining the mystical significance of Biblical verses; the mystical significance of the shapes of the Hebrew letters; the mystical significance of the cantillation signs and vowel points on the letters; the mystical significance of statements in the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'' (\"Book of Creation\"); and the use of sacred names in magic.\n\nThere are two hundred aphorism-like paragraphs.  Each paragraph uses references from the Torah to expand upon its presentation.  As with all Kabbalistic texts the meanings are highly symbolic and subject to numerous opportunities for interpretation.  A common analogy is used throughout.  A king, his servants, his daughter and his gardens are all used to explain a meaning, first of Torah and then in general, of the main topic of the text.  The paragraphs refer to each other in segments and are broken into five sections in the [[Aryeh Kaplan]] translation. These sections are loosely grouped together but they do more or less stay within the underlying themes given by their title.\n\n=== Sections ===\nSection 1 (v. 1-16) consists of commentary on the first verses of Genesis or of the Creation Story.\n\nSection 2 (v. 17-44) talks about the Aleph-Beth or the Hebrew alphabet and gets its inspiration from the [[Sefer Yetzirah]], which links these letters of creation to the overall mysticism presented in the [[Torah]].\n\nSection 3 (v. 45-122) concerns the Seven Voices and the [[Sefirot]].\n\nSection 4 (v. 124-193) is grouped under the section title of Ten Sefirot.\n\nSection 5 (v. 193-200) completes the discourse and is called Mysteries of the Soul.\n\n=== Sefirot ===\nThe Hebrew word \"[[sefirot]]\" was first described in Sefer Yezirah as corresponding to the ten basic numbers, and did not possess the meaning that later Kabbalists gave to it. It is in the Bahir that we find the first discussion of the Kabbalistic concept of Sefirot as divine attributes and powers emanating from God.\n\n\u201cWhy are they called \u05e1\u05b0\u05e4\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea (''sefirot'')? Because it is written, ''The heavens'' \u05de\u05b0\u05e1\u05b7\u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd (''mesaprim'')'', tell, God\u2019s glory'' (Psalms 19:2)\u201d (''Bahir'' \u00a7125 [Scholem]).\n\n=== Creation of the universe ===\nThe world, according to the ''Bahir,'' is not the product of an act of creation. Like [[God]], this book existed from all eternity, not only in potentiality, but in actuality; and the Creation consisted merely in the appearance of that which was latent in the first \"Sefirah,\" \"Or HaGanuz,\" or, as it is called, \"Keter 'Elyon\", which emanated from God.\n\nThis Sefirah gave birth to \"Hokmah\" (Wisdom), from which emanated \"Binah\" (Intelligence). From these three, which are the superior \"Sefirot\", and from the primary principles of the universe, emanated, one after another, the seven inferior Sefirot from which all material beings are formed. All the ten Sefirot are linked one to the other, and every one of them has an active and a passive quality\u2014emanating and receiving. The efflux of one Sefirah from another is symbolized in the form of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Thus the gimel (\u05d2), shaped like a tube open at each end, represents a Sefirah, which receives strength at one end and discharges it at the other. The ten Sefirot are the energy of God, the forms in which His being manifests itself.\n\n=== Reincarnation ===\nThe ''Bahir'' adopts the concept of [[reincarnation]] to solve the question of why the just may suffer in this world, while the wicked may be prosperous: \"The just may have been wicked in their former lives, and the wicked righteous.\"\n\n== Editions and commentaries ==\nOne of the most accurate manuscripts of the final form of ''Sefer Bahir'' was written in 1331 by Meir ben Solomon Abi-Sahula; his commentary on the ''Bahir'' was anonymously published as ''Or HaGanuz'', \"The Hidden Light\".\n\nIt has been translated into German by Gershom Scholem (1923) and into English by Aryeh Kaplan.\n\nRecently it has been critically edited by Saverio Campanini. See ''The Book of Bahir. Flavius Mithridates' Latin Translation, the Hebrew Text, and an English Version'', edited by Saverio Campanini with a Foreword by Giulio Busi, Torino, Nino Aragno Editore 2005.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Kabbalah]]\n* [[Kabbalah: Primary texts]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaBahir The Hebrew text of Sefer HaBahir] (at [https://www.sefaria.org sefaria.org])\n*[https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%91%D7%94%D7%99%D7%A8 The (original Hebrew) text of ''Bahir''] (at [[Wikisource]])\n* [http://www.pico-kabbalah.eu/ The Kabbalistic Library of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola] (an academic project publishing critical editions of the Sefer HaBahir and similar texts)\n*[[iarchive:JudaismSeferHaBahirBahirEnglishTranslationPdfKabbalahTorahIsrael|Sepher Ha-Bahir]] in an English translation by [[Aryeh Kaplan]] (at [[Internet Archive|archive.org]])\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Kabbalah texts]]\n[[Category:Jewish mystical texts]]\n[[Category:Hebrew-language names]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Anonymous mystical work dealing with Jewish Kabbalah}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{Eras of the Halakha}}\n'''''Bahir''''' or '''''Sefer HaBahir''''' ({{lang-he-n|\u05e1\u05b5\u05e4\u05b6\u05e8 \u05d4\u05b7\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8}}, {{IPA-he|\u02c8sef\u025b\u0281 \u02cchabba\u02c8hi\u0281}}; \"Book of the Bright\") is an anonymous mystical work, attributed to a 1st-century [[Rabbi|rabbinic sage]] [[Nehunya ben HaKanah]] (a contemporary of [[Yochanan ben Zakai]]) because it begins with the words, \"R.

Because it is written, ''The heavens'' \u05de\u05b0\u05e1\u05b7\u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd (''mesaprim'')'', tell, God\u2019s glory'' (Psalms 19:2)\u201d (''Bahir'' \u00a7125 [Scholem]).\n\n=== Creation of the universe ===\nThe world, according to the ''Bahir,'' is not the product of an act of creation. Like [[God]], this book existed from all eternity, not only in potentiality, but in actuality; and the Creation consisted merely in the appearance of that which was latent in the first \"Sefirah,\" \"Or HaGanuz,\" or, as it is called, \"Keter 'Elyon\", which emanated from God.\n\nThis Sefirah gave birth to \"Hokmah\" (Wisdom), from which emanated \"Binah\" (Intelligence). From these three, which are the superior \"Sefirot\", and from the primary principles of the universe, emanated, one after another, the seven inferior Sefirot from which all material beings are formed. All the ten Sefirot are linked one to the other, and every one of them has an active and a passive quality\u2014emanating and receiving. The efflux of one Sefirah from another is symbolized in the form of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Thus the gimel (\u05d2), shaped like a tube open at each end, represents a Sefirah, which receives strength at one end and discharges it at the other. The ten Sefirot are the energy of God, the forms in which His being manifests itself.\n\n=== Reincarnation ===\nThe ''Bahir'' adopts the concept of [[reincarnation]] to solve the question of why the just may suffer in this world, while the wicked may be prosperous: \"The just may have been wicked in their former lives, and the wicked righteous.\"\n\n== Editions and commentaries ==\nOne of the most accurate manuscripts of the final form of ''Sefer Bahir'' was written in 1331 by Meir ben Solomon Abi-Sahula; his commentary on the ''Bahir'' was anonymously published as ''Or HaGanuz'', \"The Hidden Light\".\n\nIt has been translated into German by Gershom Scholem (1923) and into English by Aryeh Kaplan.\n\nRecently it has been critically edited by Saverio Campanini. See ''The Book of Bahir. Flavius Mithridates' Latin Translation, the Hebrew Text, and an English Version'', edited by Saverio Campanini with a Foreword by Giulio Busi, Torino, Nino Aragno Editore 2005.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Kabbalah]]\n* [[Kabbalah: Primary texts]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaBahir The Hebrew text of Sefer HaBahir] (at [https://www.sefaria.org sefaria.org])\n*[https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%91%D7%94%D7%99%D7%A8 The (original Hebrew) text of ''Bahir''] (at [[Wikisource]])\n* [http://www.pico-kabbalah.eu/ The Kabbalistic Library of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola] (an academic project publishing critical editions of the Sefer HaBahir and similar texts)\n*[[iarchive:JudaismSeferHaBahirBahirEnglishTranslationPdfKabbalahTorahIsrael|Sepher Ha-Bahir]] in an English translation by [[Aryeh Kaplan]] (at [[Internet Archive|archive.org]])\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Kabbalah texts]]\n[[Category:Jewish mystical texts]]\n[[Category:Hebrew-language names]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahir"}

He got the idea while porting a Windows application to Macintosh. He then used SDL to port ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' to [[BeOS]] (see [[Doom source port]]s). Several other free libraries were developed to work alongside SDL, such as [[SMPEG]] and [[OpenAL]]. He also founded [[Galaxy Gameworks]] in 2008 to help commercially support SDL, although the company plans are currently on hold due to time constraints.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exploring the Galaxy | url=http://slouken.blogspot.com/2011/04/exploring-galaxy.html | date=6 April 2011| accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref> Soon after putting Galaxy Gameworks on hold, Lantinga announced that SDL 1.3 (which would then later become SDL 2.0) would be licensed under the [[zlib License]].<ref name=SDL1.3zLib>[http://forums.libsdl.org/viewtopic.php?t=7148 SDL 1.3 to be zLib Licensed], SDL Mailing List, 7 April 2011</ref>  Lantinga announced SDL 2.0 on 14 July 2012, at the same time announcing that he was joining [[Valve Corporation|Valve]], the first version of which was announced the same day he joined the company.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTE0MDU | title=SDL 2.0 Is Coming Very Soon With New Features | accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> Lantinga announced the stable release of SDL 2.0.0 on 13 August 2013.<ref name=Announcing-SDL2.0.0>[http://forums.libsdl.org/viewtopic.php?p=38569&sid=9efbea827cdebd71ee430cda823bcdc7#38569 Announcing SDL 2.0.0], SDL Mailing List, 13 August 2013</ref>\n\nSDL 2.0 is a major update to the SDL 1.2 [[codebase]] with a different, not [[Backward compatibility|backwards-compatible]]<ref>[http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/MigrationGuide#Backward-compatibility MigrationGuide - SDL Wiki'].

The only purpose of SDL is to provide a common framework for accessing these functions for multiple operating systems (cross-platform).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.libsdl.org/Introduction |title=Introduction to SDL|accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref> SDL provides support for 2D pixel operations, sound, file access, event handling, timing and threading. It is often used to complement [[OpenGL]] by setting up the graphical output and providing mouse and keyboard input, since OpenGL comprises only rendering.\n\nA game using the Simple DirectMedia Layer will ''not'' automatically run on every operating system, further adaptations must be applied. These are reduced to the minimum, since SDL also contains a few abstraction APIs for frequent functions offered by an operating system.\n\nThe syntax of SDL is function-based: all operations done in SDL are done by passing parameters to [[subroutine]]s (functions). Special structures are also used to store the specific information SDL needs to handle. SDL functions are categorized under several different subsystems.\n\n=== Subsystems ===\nSDL is divided into several subsystems:<ref>https://wiki.libsdl.org/APIByCategory</ref>\n\n; Basics: Initialization and Shutdown, Configuration Variables, Error Handling, Log Handling\n; Video: Display and Window Management, surface functions, rendering acceleration, etc.\n; Input Events: [[Event (computing)|Event handling]], Support for Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick and Game controller\n; Force Feedback: SDL_haptic.h implements support for \"Force Feedback\"\n; Audio: SDL_audio.h implements Audio Device Management, Playing and Recording\n; Threads: [[thread (computer science)|multi-threading]]: Thread Management, Thread Synchronization Primitives, Atomic Operations\n; Timers: Timer Support\n; File Abstraction: Filesystem Paths, File I/O Abstraction\n; Shared Object Support: Shared Object Loading and Function Lookup\n; Platform and CPU Information: Platform Detection, CPU Feature Detection, Byte Order and Byte Swapping, Bit Manipulation\n; Power Management: Power Management Status\n; Additional: Platform-specific functionality\n\nBesides this basic, low-level support, there also are a few separate official libraries that provide some more functions. These comprise the \"standard library\", and are provided on the official website and included in the official documentation:\n* ''SDL_image'' \u2014 support for multiple image formats<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/ |title=SDL_image 2.0 |website=libsdl.org |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n* ''SDL_mixer'' \u2014 complex audio functions, mainly for sound mixing<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/ |title=SDL_mixer 2.0 |website=libsdl.org |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n* ''SDL_net'' \u2014 networking support<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/ |title=SDL_net 2.0 |website=libsdl.org |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n* ''SDL_ttf'' \u2014 [[TrueType]] font rendering support<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/ |title=SDL_ttf 2.0 |website=libsdl.org |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n* ''SDL_rtf'' \u2014 simple [[Rich Text Format]] rendering<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_rtf/ |title=SDL_rtf 0.1 |website=libsdl.org |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nOther, non-standard libraries also exist.

A common misconception is that SDL is a [[game engine]], but this is not true. However, the library is suited to building games directly, or is usable ''indirectly'' by engines built on top of it.\n\nThe library is internally written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and possibly, depending on the target platform, [[C++]] or [[Objective-C]], and provides the [[application programming interface]] in C, with bindings to other languages available.<ref name=\"sdl2bindings\">{{cite web |url=http://www.libsdl.org/languages.php |title=SDL Language Bindings |website=libsdl.org |publisher=Simple DirectMedia Layer |accessdate=13 August 2014}}</ref> It is [[free and open-source software]] subject to the requirements of the [[zlib License]] since version 2.0, and with prior versions subject to the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]].<ref name=\"license\" /> Under the zlib License, SDL 2.0 is freely available for [[static linking]] in [[closed-source]] projects, unlike SDL 1.2.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.libsdl.org/license.php | title=Licensing the Simple DirectMedia Layer library | accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nSDL is extensively used in the industry in both large and small projects. Over 700 games, 180 applications, and 120 demos have been posted on the library website.\n\n== History ==\n[[Sam Lantinga]] created the library, first releasing it in early 1998, while working for [[Loki Entertainment|Loki Software]]. He got the idea while porting a Windows application to Macintosh. He then used SDL to port ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' to [[BeOS]] (see [[Doom source port]]s). Several other free libraries were developed to work alongside SDL, such as [[SMPEG]] and [[OpenAL]]. He also founded [[Galaxy Gameworks]] in 2008 to help commercially support SDL, although the company plans are currently on hold due to time constraints.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exploring the Galaxy | url=http://slouken.blogspot.com/2011/04/exploring-galaxy.html | date=6 April 2011| accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref> Soon after putting Galaxy Gameworks on hold, Lantinga announced that SDL 1.3 (which would then later become SDL 2.0) would be licensed under the [[zlib License]].<ref name=SDL1.3zLib>[http://forums.libsdl.org/viewtopic.php?t=7148 SDL 1.3 to be zLib Licensed], SDL Mailing List, 7 April 2011</ref>  Lantinga announced SDL 2.0 on 14 July 2012, at the same time announcing that he was joining [[Valve Corporation|Valve]], the first version of which was announced the same day he joined the company.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTE0MDU | title=SDL 2.0 Is Coming Very Soon With New Features | accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref> Lantinga announced the stable release of SDL 2.0.0 on 13 August 2013.<ref name=Announcing-SDL2.0.0>[http://forums.libsdl.org/viewtopic.php?p=38569&sid=9efbea827cdebd71ee430cda823bcdc7#38569 Announcing SDL 2.0.0], SDL Mailing List, 13 August 2013</ref>\n\nSDL 2.0 is a major update to the SDL 1.2 [[codebase]] with a different, not [[Backward compatibility|backwards-compatible]]<ref>[http://wiki.libsdl.org/moin.cgi/MigrationGuide#Backward-compatibility MigrationGuide - SDL Wiki'].

The only purpose of SDL is to provide a common framework for accessing these functions for multiple operating systems (cross-platform).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiki.libsdl.org/Introduction |title=Introduction to SDL|accessdate=3 March 2014}}</ref> SDL provides support for 2D pixel operations, sound, file access, event handling, timing and threading. It is often used to complement [[OpenGL]] by setting up the graphical output and providing mouse and keyboard input, since OpenGL comprises only rendering.\n\nA game using the Simple DirectMedia Layer will ''not'' automatically run on every operating system, further adaptations must be applied. These are reduced to the minimum, since SDL also contains a few abstraction APIs for frequent functions offered by an operating system.\n\nThe syntax of SDL is function-based: all operations done in SDL are done by passing parameters to [[subroutine]]s (functions). Special structures are also used to store the specific information SDL needs to handle. SDL functions are categorized under several different subsystems.\n\n=== Subsystems ===\nSDL is divided into several subsystems:<ref>https://wiki.libsdl.org/APIByCategory</ref>\n\n; Basics: Initialization and Shutdown, Configuration Variables, Error Handling, Log Handling\n; Video: Display and Window Management, surface functions, rendering acceleration, etc.\n; Input Events: [[Event (computing)|Event handling]], Support for Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick and Game controller\n; Force Feedback: SDL_haptic.h implements support for \"Force Feedback\"\n; Audio: SDL_audio.h implements Audio Device Management, Playing and Recording\n; Threads: [[thread (computer science)|multi-threading]]: Thread Management, Thread Synchronization Primitives, Atomic Operations\n; Timers: Timer Support\n; File Abstraction: Filesystem Paths, File I/O Abstraction\n; Shared Object Support: Shared Object Loading and Function Lookup\n; Platform and CPU Information: Platform Detection, CPU Feature Detection, Byte Order and Byte Swapping, Bit Manipulation\n; Power Management: Power Management Status\n; Additional: Platform-specific functionality\n\nBesides this basic, low-level support, there also are a few separate official libraries that provide some more functions. These comprise the \"standard library\", and are provided on the official website and included in the official documentation:\n* ''SDL_image'' \u2014 support for multiple image formats<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/ |title=SDL_image 2.0 |website=libsdl.org |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n* ''SDL_mixer'' \u2014 complex audio functions, mainly for sound mixing<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/ |title=SDL_mixer 2.0 |website=libsdl.org |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n* ''SDL_net'' \u2014 networking support<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/ |title=SDL_net 2.0 |website=libsdl.org |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n* ''SDL_ttf'' \u2014 [[TrueType]] font rendering support<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/ |title=SDL_ttf 2.0 |website=libsdl.org |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n* ''SDL_rtf'' \u2014 simple [[Rich Text Format]] rendering<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_rtf/ |title=SDL_rtf 0.1 |website=libsdl.org |accessdate=19 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nOther, non-standard libraries also exist.

Among the children who spent time in her care were the daughters of [[Winnie Madikizela-Mandela|Winnie]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]'s \u2013 Zinzi and Zenani \u2013 and [[Bram Fischer]]'s daughter, Ilsa.\n\n==Legacy and honours==\nJoseph died on 25 December 1992 at the age of 87.{{cn|date=September 2019}} \n\nJoseph was admitted to the [[Order of Simon of Cyrene]] in 1992, the highest honour the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]] bestows on its lay members who have provided outstanding service.<ref name=\"hist_Hist\">{{Cite web |title=Historical Papers, Wits University |author= |work=historicalpapers.wits.ac.za |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01 |url=http://www.historicalpapers.wits.ac.za/?inventory/U/collections&c=A1985/R/6114 |language= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nShe was also awarded the [[Isitwalandwe Medal |Isitwalandwe/Seaparankwe Medal]] by the ANC in 1992.\n\nPlaces named after Helen Joseph include the former Davenport Road in [[Glenwood, KwaZulu-Natal]], the [[Helen Joseph Hospital]] in [[Johannesburg]], a student residence at [[Rhodes University]], [[Grahamstown]] and a road in Rustenburg.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Published works==\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Joseph |first=Helen |title=If this be Treason |url=https://archive.org/details/ifthisbetreason0000jose |url-access=registration |year=1963 |publisher=Andre Deutsch |place=London |isbn=978-0-620-22197-9 |display-authors=0 |quote=Helen Joseph's Dramatic Account of the Treason Trial, the Longest in South Africa's History and One of the Strangest Trials of the 20th Century}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Joseph |first=Helen |title=Tomorrow's Sun |url=https://archive.org/details/tomorrowssunsmug0000jose |url-access=registration |year=1967 |publisher=[[John Day Company]] |location=New York |display-authors=0 |quote=A smuggled journal from South Africa}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Joseph |first=Helen |title=Side by Side: The Autobiography of Helen Joseph |url=https://archive.org/details/sidebysideautobi0000jose |url-access=registration |year=1986 |publisher=William Morrow & Co |isbn=978-0-688-07103-5 |location=New York |display-authors=0}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of people subject to banning orders under apartheid]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Van Wyk|first=Chris |title=Helen Joseph|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PciWWeSv4k4C|year=2003|publisher=Awareness Publishing|isbn=978-1-919910-76-5}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Rappaport|first=Helen |title=Encyclopedia of Women Social Reformers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpuSzowmIkgC|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-101-4}}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060114012030/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/people/hjoseph.html Short biography on the website of the ANC]\n*[http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/helen-joseph SAHistory - Helen Joseph]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joseph, Helen}}\n[[Category:1905 births]]\n[[Category:1992 deaths]]\n[[Category:Alumni of King's College London]]\n[[Category:Jewish South African anti-apartheid activists]]\n[[Category:People acquitted of treason]]\n[[Category:South African Anglicans]]\n[[Category:White South African anti-apartheid activists|J]]\n[[Category:British emigrants to South Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Takirajohns83", "label": "safe", "comment": "I added that she lived in an anti-Semitic and racist household to highlight her will to be her own person and added a citation for this statement.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Joseph"}
