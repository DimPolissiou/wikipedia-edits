Set in [[County Durham]], [[North East England|England]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u201385 miners' strike]], the film is about a working-class boy who discovers his passion for [[ballet]], despite his father's objection and the [[Western stereotype of the male ballet dancer|negative stereotype]] associated of being a male ballet dancer. The film stars [[Jamie Bell]] as 11-year-old Billy, [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as his father, [[Jamie Draven]] as Billy's older brother, and [[Julie Walters]] as his ballet teacher.\n\nAdapted from a play called ''Dancer'' by [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]], development on the film began in 1999. Around 2,000 boys were considered for the role of Billy before Bell was eventually chosen for the role. Filming began in the North of England in August 1999. [[Greg Brenman]] and Jon Finn served as producers, while [[Stephen Warbeck]] composed the film's score. ''Billy Elliot'' is a co-production between [[BBC Films]], [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Pictures]] and [[Working Title Films]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], and then began a wider theatrical release on 29 September 2000 by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Billy Elliot'' received positive critical response and commercial success, earning \u00a373 million (US$109.3 million) worldwide on a \u00a33 million budget (US$5 million). At the [[British Academy Film Awards|2001 British Academy Film Awards]], the film won three of thirteen award nominations. The film also earned three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. In 2001, the film was adapted into a novel by [[Melvin Burgess]]. The story was also adapted for the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage as ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in County Durham, England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|strike]] (the latter being the union bully), and also his maternal grandmother, who has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and once aspired to be a professional dancer.\n\nBilly's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is temporarily being used as a [[soup kitchen]] for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.[[File:Jamie Bell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Jamie Bell]] (pictured in 2015) received acclaim for his performance as Billy.|216x216px]]\n\nMrs. Wilkinson believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nOver Christmas, Billy learns his best friend Michael is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted; he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Mrs. Wilkinson tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to [[strikebreaker|cross the picket line]] to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money and Jackie pawns Billy's mother's jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to London to audition.\n\nAlthough very nervous, Billy performs well, but he punches another boy in frustration at the audition, fearing that he has ruined his chances of attaining his dream. He is rebuked by the review board, but when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, he struggles for words but describes it as being \"like electricity\". Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners' strike, and he leaves home for London.\n\nIn 1998, 25-year-old Billy takes the stage to perform the Swan in [[Matthew Bourne]]'s ''[[Swan Lake (Bourne)|Swan Lake]]'', as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch from the audience; his father is visibly moved by the performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Billy Elliot \n** [[Adam Cooper (dancer)|Adam Cooper]] as Billy aged 25\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Sandra Wilkinson\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Jackie Elliot\n* [[Jamie Draven]] as Tony Elliot\n* [[Jean Heywood]] as Grandma\n* [[Stuart Wells]] as Michael Caffrey\n** Merryn Owen as Michael aged 25\n* Nicola Blackwell as Debbie Wilkinson\n* Colin Maclachlan as Tom Wilkinson\n* [[Mike Elliott (comedian)|Mike Elliott]] as George Watson\n* Billy Fane as Mr Braithwaite\n* Janine Birkett as Jenny Elliot\n* [[Charlie Hardwick]] as Sheila Briggs\n* [[Matthew James Thomas]] as Simon\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Dr. Crane\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Royal Ballet School principal\n* [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as Royal Ballet School vice-principal\n* [[Neil North]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n* [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Avon Street, Easington Colliery.jpg|thumb|Terraced homes on Avon Street were used for filming, where Andrew and Alnwick Streets once stood. |alt=]]Lee Hall developed ''Billy Elliot'' from his play ''Dancer'', which premiered as a rehearsed reading in 1998 at the [[Live Theatre Company|Live Theatre]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee Hall interview: Why Lee will always love Live Theatre |date=17 June 2014 |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |author=The Journal |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106235237/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |archive-date=6 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was heavily influenced by photographer [[Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen]]'s book ''Step by Step'', about a dancing school in nearby [[North Shields]].

At first, Daldry was not convinced with the script, but said, \"I liked the emotional honesty of ''Billy Elliot.'' Also Lee writes brilliant kids. And there's a series of themes in it I rather enjoyed: Grief; finding means of self-identification through some sort of creative act, in this case dance; and the miner's strike itself.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|title=INTERVIEW: Stephen Daldry Dances to Success with \"Billy Elliot\"|last=Indiewire|last2=Indiewire|date=2000-10-17|website=IndieWire|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102200205/https://www.indiewire.com/2000/10/interview-stephen-daldry-dances-to-success-with-billy-elliot-81337/|archive-date=2 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Working Title Films]] approached Daldry to become director and he accepted the offer.

Set in [[County Durham]], [[North East England|England]] during the [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|1984\u201385 miners' strike]], the film is about a working-class boy who discovers his passion for [[ballet]], despite his father's objection and the [[Western stereotype of the male ballet dancer|negative stereotype]] associated of being a male ballet dancer. The film stars [[Jamie Bell]] as 11-year-old Billy, [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as his father, [[Jamie Draven]] as Billy's older brother, and [[Julie Walters]] as his ballet teacher.\n\nAdapted from a play called ''Dancer'' by [[Lee Hall (playwright)|Lee Hall]], development on the film began in 1999. Around 2,000 boys were considered for the role of Billy before Bell was eventually chosen for the role. Filming began in the North of England in August 1999. [[Greg Brenman]] and Jon Finn served as producers, while [[Stephen Warbeck]] composed the film's score. ''Billy Elliot'' is a co-production between [[BBC Films]], [[Tiger Aspect Productions|Tiger Aspect Pictures]] and [[Working Title Films]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[2000 Cannes Film Festival]], and then began a wider theatrical release on 29 September 2000 by [[Universal Pictures]]. ''Billy Elliot'' received positive critical response and commercial success, earning \u00a373 million (US$109.3 million) on a \u00a33 million budget (US$5 million) worldwide. At the [[British Academy Film Awards|2001 British Academy Film Awards]], the film won three of thirteen award nominations. The film also earned three [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]]. In 2001, the film was adapted into a novel by [[Melvin Burgess]]. The story was also adapted for the [[West End theatre|West End]] stage as ''[[Billy Elliot the Musical]]'' in 2005; it opened in Australia in 2007 and on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 2008.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1984, Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old from the fictional Everington in [[County Durham]], England, loves to dance and has hopes of becoming a professional ballet dancer. Billy lives with his widowed father, Jackie, and older brother, Tony, both coal miners out on [[UK miners' strike (1984\u201385)|strike]] (the latter being the union bully), and also his maternal grandmother, who has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and once aspired to be a professional dancer.\n\nBilly's father sends him to the gym to learn boxing, but Billy dislikes the sport. He happens to see a ballet class that is using the gym while their usual basement studio is temporarily being used as a soup kitchen for the striking miners. Unknown to Jackie, Billy joins the ballet class. When Jackie discovers this, he forbids Billy to take any more ballet. But, passionate about dancing, Billy secretly continues lessons with the help of his dance teacher, Sandra Wilkinson.[[File:Jamie Bell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Jamie Bell]] (pictured in 2015) received acclaim for his performance as Billy.|216x216px]]\n\nMrs. Wilkinson believes that Billy is talented enough to study at the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London, but due to Tony's arrest during a clash between police and striking miners, Billy misses the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson tells Jackie about the missed opportunity, but fearing that Billy will be considered to be gay, both Jackie and Tony are outraged at the prospect of him becoming a professional ballet dancer.\n\nOver Christmas, Billy learns his best friend Michael is gay. Billy is supportive of his friend. Later, Jackie catches Billy dancing in the gym and realises his son is truly gifted; he resolves to do whatever it takes to help Billy attain his dream. Mrs. Wilkinson tries to persuade Jackie to let her pay for the audition, but he replies that Billy is his son and he does not need charity. Jackie attempts to [[strikebreaker|cross the picket line]] to pay for the trip to London, but Tony stops him. Instead, his fellow miners and the neighbourhood raise some money and Jackie pawns Billy's mother's jewellery to cover the cost, and Jackie takes him to [[London]] to audition.\n\nAlthough very nervous, Billy performs well, but he punches another boy in frustration at the audition, fearing that he has ruined his chances of attaining his dream. He is rebuked by the review board, but when asked what it feels like when he is dancing, he struggles for words but describes it as being \"like electricity\". Seemingly rejected, Billy returns home with his father. Sometime later, the Royal Ballet School sends him a letter of acceptance, coinciding with the end of the miners' strike, and he leaves home for London.\n\nIn 1998, 25-year-old Billy takes the stage to perform the Swan in [[Matthew Bourne]]'s ''[[Swan Lake (Bourne)|Swan Lake]]'', as Jackie, Tony, and Michael watch from the audience; his father is visibly moved by the performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as Billy Elliot \n** [[Adam Cooper (dancer)|Adam Cooper]] as Billy aged 25\n* [[Julie Walters]] as Sandra Wilkinson\n* [[Gary Lewis (actor)|Gary Lewis]] as Jackie Elliot\n* [[Jamie Draven]] as Tony Elliot\n* [[Jean Heywood]] as Grandma\n* [[Stuart Wells]] as Michael Caffrey\n** Merryn Owen as Michael aged 25\n* Nicola Blackwell as Debbie Wilkinson\n* Colin Maclachlan as Tom Wilkinson\n* [[Mike Elliott (comedian)|Mike Elliott]] as George Watson\n* Billy Fane as Mr Braithwaite\n* Janine Birkett as Jenny Elliot\n* [[Charlie Hardwick]] as Sheila Briggs\n* [[Matthew James Thomas]] as Simon\n* [[Stephen Mangan]] as Dr. Crane\n* [[Patrick Malahide]] as Royal Ballet School principal\n* [[Barbara Leigh-Hunt]] as Royal Ballet School vice-principal\n* [[Neil North]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n* [[Lee Williams (actor)|Lee Williams]] as Royal Ballet School tutor\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Avon Street, Easington Colliery.jpg|thumb|Terraced homes used for filming, where Andrew and Alnwick Streets once stood. |alt=]]Lee Hall developed ''Billy Elliot'' from his play ''Dancer'', which premiered as a rehearsed reading in 1998 at the [[Live Theatre Company|Live Theatre]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lee Hall interview: Why Lee will always love Live Theatre |date=17 June 2014 |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |author=The Journal |work=[[The Journal (newspaper)|The Journal]] |accessdate=6 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106235237/http://www.thejournal.co.uk/culture/culture-news/lee-hall-interview-lee-always-7279467 |archive-date=6 January 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> He was heavily influenced by photographer [[Sirkka-Liisa Konttinen]]'s book ''Step by Step'', about a dancing school in nearby [[North Shields]].

At first, Daldry was not convinced with the script, but said, \"I liked the emotional honesty of ''Billy Elliot.'' Also Lee writes brilliant kids.

In the 19th century, the age of [[colonialism]] was at its height and the great [[Chinese diaspora]] began. Many colonies lacked a large pool of laborers.  Meanwhile, in the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] in China, there was a surge in emigration as a result of the poverty and ruin caused by the [[Taiping rebellion]].<ref>The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present, by Henry K.

Many Hokkien chose to work in Southeast Asia (where they had earlier links starting from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era), as did the Cantonese. The area of Taishan, in Guangdong province was the source for many of the economic migrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} San Francisco and California was an early American destination in the mid 1800s because of the California Gold Rush. Many settled in San Francisco forming one of the earliest (or earliest?;reference?) Chinatowns. For the countries in North America and Australasia, great numbers of laborers were also needed in the dangerous tasks of [[gold mining]] and [[railway]] construction.  Widespread famine in Guangdong impelled many Cantonese to work in these countries to improve the living conditions of their relatives. Some overseas Chinese were sold{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to [[South America]] during the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855\u20131867) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] in Guangdong.

Moreover, the [[average height]] of [[Southern Chinese]] used to be relatively stable at around 161\u2013164&nbsp;cm for males.

Many of these emigrants who entered Western countries were themselves overseas Chinese, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom (mainly England), Australia, Canada, US, South America, Europe and other parts of the world.  The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] further accelerated the migration.  The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of [[sovereignty]] in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.  In fact, after the Tiananmen Square incident, the lines for immigration visas increased at every consulate in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=the preceding paragraph is entirely devoid of references|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations.

The emergence of the [[Filipino mestizo|Mestizo class]] would later rise to the [[Principal\u00eda|noble Principalia class]], which later carried over and fueled the elite ruling classes of the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American era]] and later sovereign Philippines. Since the 1860s, most Chinese immigrants of the contemporary [[Chinese Filipino]]s have come from Fujian and thus form the bulk of the contemporary mixed and unmixed Chinese Filipinos and Filipinos of partial Chinese ancestry. Older generations have retained Chinese traditions and the use of [[Philippine Hokkien]] ([[Southern Min|Min Nan]]), while the current majority of younger generations largely communicate in [[Philippine English|English]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] and have largely layered facets of both Western and Filipino culture onto their Chinese cultural background.\n\n[[File:East Coast Road 3, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|right|Since their early migration, many of the overseas Chinese have adopted local culture, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand with large [[Peranakan]] community. Most of them in Singapore were once concentrated in [[Katong]].]]\n\nIn [[Myanmar]], the Chinese rarely intermarry (even amongst different Chinese linguistic groups), but have largely adopted the Burmese culture whilst maintaining Chinese cultural affinities. In [[Cambodia]], between 1965 and 1993, people with Chinese names were prevented from finding governmental employment, leading to a large number of people changing their names to a local, Cambodian name. Indonesia, and Myanmar were among the countries that do not allow birth names to be registered in foreign languages, including Chinese. But since 2003, the Indonesian government has allowed ethnic Chinese people to use their Chinese name or using their Chinese family name on their birth certificate.\n\n[[File:Sandakan Sabah PuuJihShihTemple-09.jpg|thumb|A [[Malaysian Chinese]] praying in [[Puu Jih Shih Temple]], [[Sandakan]], Sabah in front of [[Guanyin]] during [[Chinese New Year]] in 2013.]]\n\nIn Vietnam, all Chinese names can be pronounced by [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese readings]]. For example, the name of the previous Chinese president  [[Hu Jintao|H\u00fa J\u01d0nt\u0101o]] ({{lang|zh-cn|\u80e1\u9326\u6fe4}}) would be spelled as \"H\u1ed3 C\u1ea9m \u0110\u00e0o\" in Vietnamese. There are also great similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese traditions such as the use Lunar New Year, philosophy such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and ancestor worship; leads to some [[Hoa people|Hoa]] people adopt easily to Vietnamese culture, however many Hoa still prefer to maintain Chinese cultural background. The official census from 2009 accounted the Hoa population at some 823,000 individuals and ranked 6th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the rests live in the southern provinces.<ref name=\"GSO2009\" />\n\nOn the other hand, in Malaysia, Singapore, and [[Brunei]], the ethnic Chinese have maintained a distinct communal identity.\n\nIn [[East Timor]], a large fraction of Chinese are of [[Hakka people#East Timor|Hakka descent]].\n\nIn Western countries, the overseas Chinese generally use romanised versions of their Chinese names, and the use of local first names is also common.\n\n===Discrimination===\n{{See also|Sinophobia}}\n\nOverseas Chinese have often experienced hostility and [[discrimination]].\n\nIn countries with small ethnic Chinese minorities, the [[economic disparity]] can be remarkable. For example, in 1998, ethnic Chinese made up just 1% of the population of the [[Philippines]] and 4% of the population in [[Indonesia]], but have wide influence in the Philippine and Indonesian private economies.<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, pp. 3, 43.</ref> The book ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World on Fire]]'', describing the Chinese as a \"market-[[dominant minority]]\", notes that \"Chinese market dominance and intense resentment amongst the indigenous majority is characteristic of virtually every country in Southeast Asia except Thailand and Singapore\".<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, p. 61.</ref> Chinese market dominance is present in Thailand and the Philippines, but is noted for its lack of resentment, while Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese. Widespread violent anti-Chinese sentiment spread across Southeast Asia, mostly occur in Malaysia and Indonesia, but not very much in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.\n\nThis asymmetrical economic position has incited anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer majorities. Sometimes the anti-Chinese attitudes turn violent, such as the [[13 May Incident]] in Malaysia in 1969 and the [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]] in Indonesia, in which more than 2,000 people died, mostly rioters burned to death in a shopping mall.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4323219 Malaysia's race rules].

The question of to what extent ethnic Malays, Chinese, or others are \"native\" to Malaysia is a sensitive political one.

In the 19th century, the age of [[colonialism]] was at its height and the great [[Chinese diaspora]] began. Many colonies lacked a large pool of laborers.  Meanwhile, in the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] in China, there was a surge in emigration as a result of the poverty and ruin caused by the [[Taiping rebellion]].<ref>The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present, by Henry K.

Many Hokkien chose to work in Southeast Asia (where they had earlier links starting from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era), as did the Cantonese. The area of Taishan, in Guangdong province was the source for many of the economic migrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} San Francisco and California was an early American destination in the mid 1800s because of the California Gold Rush. Many settled in San Francisco forming one of the earliest (or earliest?;reference?) Chinatowns. For the countries in North America and Australasia, great numbers of laborers were also needed in the dangerous tasks of [[gold mining]] and [[railway]] construction.  Widespread famine in Guangdong impelled many Cantonese to work in these countries to improve the living conditions of their relatives. Some overseas Chinese were sold{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to [[South America]] during the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855\u20131867) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] in Guangdong.

Moreover, the [[average height]] of [[Southern Chinese]] used to be relatively stable at around 161\u2013164&nbsp;cm for males. Another important fact is that the height of Chinese emigrants varied depending on the location they have chosen.

Many of these emigrants who entered Western countries were themselves overseas Chinese, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom (mainly England), Australia, Canada, US, South America, Europe and other parts of the world.  The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] further accelerated the migration.  The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of [[sovereignty]] in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.  In fact, after the Tiananmen Square incident, the lines for immigration visas increased at every consulate in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=the preceding paragraph is entirely devoid of references|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations.

Since the 1860s, most Chinese immigrants of the contemporary [[Chinese Filipino]]s have come from Fujian and thus form the bulk of the contemporary mixed and unmixed Chinese Filipinos and Filipinos of partial Chinese ancestry. Older generations have retained Chinese traditions and the use of [[Philippine Hokkien]] ([[Southern Min|Min Nan]]), while the current majority of younger generations largely communicate in [[Philippine English|English]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] and have largely layered facets of both Western and Filipino culture onto their Chinese cultural background.\n\n[[File:East Coast Road 3, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|right|Since their early migration, many of the overseas Chinese have adopted local culture, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand with large [[Peranakan]] community.

There are also great similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese traditions such as the use Lunar New Year, philosophy such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and ancestor worship; leads to some [[Hoa people|Hoa]] people adopt easily to Vietnamese culture, however many Hoa still prefer to maintain Chinese cultural background. The official census from 2009 accounted the Hoa population at some 823,000 individuals and ranked 6th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the rests live in the southern provinces.<ref name=\"GSO2009\" />\n\nOn the other hand, in Malaysia, Singapore, and [[Brunei]], the ethnic Chinese have maintained a distinct communal identity.\n\nIn [[East Timor]], a large fraction of Chinese are of [[Hakka people#East Timor|Hakka descent]].\n\nIn Western countries, the overseas Chinese generally use romanised versions of their Chinese names, and the use of local first names is also common.\n\n===Discrimination===\n{{See also|Sinophobia}}\n\nOverseas Chinese have often experienced hostility and [[discrimination]].\n\nIn countries with small ethnic Chinese minorities, the [[economic disparity]] can be remarkable. For example, in 1998, ethnic Chinese made up just 1% of the population of the [[Philippines]] and 4% of the population in [[Indonesia]], but have wide influence in the Philippine and Indonesian private economies.<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, pp. 3, 43.</ref> The book ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World on Fire]]'', describing the Chinese as a \"market-[[dominant minority]]\", notes that \"Chinese market dominance and intense resentment amongst the indigenous majority is characteristic of virtually every country in Southeast Asia except Thailand and Singapore\".<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, p. 61.</ref> Chinese market dominance is present in Thailand and the Philippines, but is noted for its lack of resentment, while Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese. Widespread violent anti-Chinese sentiment spread across Southeast Asia, mostly occur in Malaysia and Indonesia, but not very much in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.\n\nThis asymmetrical economic position has incited anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer majorities. Sometimes the anti-Chinese attitudes turn violent, such as the [[13 May Incident]] in Malaysia in 1969 and the [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]] in Indonesia, in which more than 2,000 people died, mostly rioters burned to death in a shopping mall.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4323219 Malaysia's race rules].

In Malaysia, ethnic Chinese tend to support equal and meritocratic treatment on the expectation that they would not be discriminated against in the resulting competition for government contracts, university places, etc., whereas many \"[[Bumiputra]]\" (\"native sons\") [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] oppose this on the grounds that their group needs such protections in order to retain their patrimony. The question of to what extent ethnic Malays, Chinese, or others are \"native\" to Malaysia is a sensitive political one.
