The road connects Tennessee's three largest cities\u2014[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]\u2014and crosses all of Tennessee's physiographical provinces and [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]]\u2014the [[Mississippi Embayment]] and [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in [[West Tennessee]], the [[Highland Rim]] and [[Nashville Basin]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]], [[Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province]], and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Province]] in [[East Tennessee]]. The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville.]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eastbound lanes have a direct access partial-y exit to a surface road to the airport. The westbound lanes of I-40 are only accessible from this interchange. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). Also at this interchange is a separate partial y interchange which provides access to SR 45 via a bypass which junctions with SR 45 about {{convert|3/4|mi|km}} north of I-40. This bypass is only accessible via the eastbound lanes of I-40, and the westbound lanes are only accessible from it. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later I-40 begins a steep ascent where the eastbound lanes gain a truck climbing lane. This lane terminates about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of five interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beginning a few miles beyond this point, I-40 begins another steep uphill ascent, protracted over a distance of about {{convert|5|mi}}, reaching an elevation of nearly {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}. Through this section, the speed limit reduces to 65 mph, and 55 mph for trucks on the westbound descent. Continuing through a predominantly wooded area, continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]] a few miles later, where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 reaches an elevation of over {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} for the first time in Tennessee, before crossing into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]] about {{convert|1/4|mi|km}}.\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. Beyond this point, the Interstate descends into a short depression before crossing into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] and mile 340, entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. Shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit drops to 60&nbsp;mph in the eastbound lanes. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\n[[File:TN I40 East-I75 North West Knoxville.jpg|thumb|left|Interstate 40 concurrent with Interstate 75 in Knoxville]]\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures.

I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:I-40 EB-I-75 NB 1 mile to TN 332.jpg|thumb|left|[[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]] north running [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-40 east in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]]]\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].

The road connects Tennessee's three largest cities\u2014[[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]\u2014and crosses all of Tennessee's physiographical provinces and [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]]\u2014the [[Mississippi Embayment]] and [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in [[West Tennessee]], the [[Highland Rim]] and [[Nashville Basin]] in [[Middle Tennessee]], and the [[Cumberland Plateau]], [[Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province]], and [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge Province]] in [[East Tennessee]]. The Tennessee section of I-40 is {{convert|452|mi|km}} long, the longest of any state on the route.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===West Tennessee===\n====Memphis====\n[[File:Hernando de Soto Bridge Memphis.jpg|thumb|left|The Hernando de Soto Bridge, where I-40 crosses the [[Mississippi River]] into [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]]]\n\nI-40 enters Tennessee via the six lane [[Hernando de Soto Bridge]], which spans the Mississippi River at river mile 736. Immediately within the city of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the interstate passes across the southern half of [[Mud Island, Memphis|Mud Island]] before crossing the [[Wolf River (Tennessee)|Wolf River Harbor]] into downtown Memphis. Throughout Memphis, the highway contains a minimum of six through lanes, except through major interchanges. Upon reaching Memphis, I-40 immediately has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 51 in Tennessee|U.S. Route&nbsp;51]] (US&nbsp;51), and {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} from the state line is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 240 (Tennessee)|I-240]], where I-40 abruptly turns north, following a route formerly designated as part of I-240. (For the next {{convert|10|mi|km|disp=sqbr}}, this segment is designated as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Expressway.) About one mile later, I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 14|State Route 14]] (SR&nbsp;14, Jackson Avenue), and about {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, the highway crosses the Wolf River again and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Tennessee State Route 300|SR&nbsp;300]], a controlled-access connector to US&nbsp;51. At this interchange, the Interstate turns sharp east. Passing first near the neighborhoods of [[Frayser, Memphis|Frayser]] and [[Raleigh, Memphis|Raleigh]], about {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} later, I-40 crosses the Wolf River for a third time as the highway turns southeast, and has an interchange with SR&nbsp;14 again. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 204|SR&nbsp;204]] (Covington Pike), and {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond this point, I-40 comes to a complicated interchange with [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;64]]/[[U.S. Route 70 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;70]]/[[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US&nbsp;79]], I-240 southbound and Sam Cooper Boulevard eastbound, and turns sharp northeast, leaving Memphis. For the next several miles the highway is known as the Isaac Hayes Memorial Highway and is eight lanes, the left lanes functioning as [[HOV lane]]s during [[rush hour]], passing through several major suburbs of Memphis, including [[Bartlett, Tennessee|Bartlett]], [[Cordova, Tennessee|Cordova]], and [[Lakeland, Tennessee|Lakeland]]. At exit 18, which is US&nbsp;64, the highway narrows to six lanes, and to four lanes a short distance beyond. Several miles later, near [[Arlington, Tennessee|Arlington]], at exit 24, is a [[cloverleaf interchange]] with [[Interstate 269|I-269]]/[[Tennessee State Route 385|SR&nbsp;385]].\n\n====Gulf coastal plain====\n\nAbout one mile east of Arlington, I-40 enters [[Fayette County, Tennessee|Fayette County]], and about another mile later crosses the [[Loosahatchie River]] and leaves the Memphis area, traversing through the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] in a very flat and straight stretch of mostly farmland with some rural woodlands, bypassing most cities and communities. At exit 35 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 59|SR 59]], which connects to [[Covington, Tennessee|Covington]] and  [[Somerville, Tennessee|Somerville]]. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]], and about {{convert|10|mi|km}} later, the highway turns north and enters the [[Hatchie National Wildlife Refuge]] and crosses the [[Hatchie River]]. Upon exiting the refuge about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, I-40 turns east and passes just southeast of Brownsville, where it has an interchange first with [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], which also connects to Somerville. Eight miles later is an interchange with US 70, and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]]. Entering [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], at mile marker 78, the crosses the [[South Fork of the Forked Deer River|South Fork]] of the [[Forked Deer River]]. Passing through the northern half of the city, I-40 has a total of six exits in Jackson. First, at mile 79, is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 412 in Tennessee|US 412]] (which connects to [[Alamo, Tennessee|Alamo]] and [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]]), then about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later an interchange with the [[Tennessee State Route 186#U.S. Route 45 Bypass|US 45 Bypass]]. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 45|US 45]], which also connects to [[Humboldt, Tennessee|Humboldt]] and [[Milan, Tennessee|Milan]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70, which also connects to Huntington, Tennessee|Huntington]], and I-40 leaves Jackson at this point. From this point, I-40 continues east northeast through a sparsely populated area of farmland and woodlands, and about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later enters [[Henderson County, Tennessee|Henderson County]]. About {{convert|15|mi|km}} later, near the community of [[Parkers Crossroads, Tennessee|Parkers Crossroads]], I-40 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 22|SR 22]], a major north-south connector route in west Tennessee, which, at this interchange, is signed as a connector to [[Lexington, Tennessee|Lexington]] and Huntington. A few miles later, I-40 crosses the [[Big Sandy River (Tennessee)|Big Sandy River]] before proceeding through the northern half of the [[Natchez Trace State Park]], and around milepost 120 enters [[Decatur County, Tennessee|Decatur County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 641|US 641]]/[[Tennessee State Route 69|SR 69]], another major north-south corridor, which at this point connects to [[Camden, Tennessee|Camden]] and [[Decaturville, Tennessee|Decaturville]]. I-40 then enters [[Benton County, Tennessee|Benton County]], and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} later,   descends about {{convert|400|ft|m}} on a steep grade over the course of a mile, the westbound lanes gaining a [[truck climbing lane]], before crossing the [[Tennessee River]] into [[Middle Tennessee]] on the {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} [[Jimmy Mann Evans Memorial Bridge]]. This river crossing is also located within the [[Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n===Middle Tennessee===\n====Western highland rim====\n\nUpon crossing the Tennessee River into [[Humphreys County, Tennessee|Humphreys County]], I-40 traverses through mostly vast woodlands in the rugged hills of the Western [[Highland Rim]] for a considerable distance. This section is characterized by several noticeable upgrades and downgrades, with mostly minor curves. About {{convert|8|mi|km}} beyond the Tennessee River is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 13|SR 13]], which connects to [[Linden, Tennessee|Linden]] and [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]]. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 crosses into [[Hickman County, Tennessee|Hickman County]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 50|SR 50]], which connects to [[Centerville, Tennessee|Centerville]]. I-40 then crosses the [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck River]], traveling through mostly wooded areas characterized by further rugged terrain, and at mile 163 is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 48|SR 48]], the first exit for [[Dickson, Tennessee|Dickson]]. I-40 then enters [[Dickson County, Tennessee|Dickson County]], and shortly beyond this point crosses the [[Piney River (Middle Tennessee)|Piney River]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 46|SR 46]], the second Dickson exit which also connects to Centerville and [[Columbia, Tennessee|Columbia]]. Approaching the urban parts of the [[Nashville metropolitan area]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville. The highway continues through mostly woodlands and rugged terrain, and crossing into [[Williamson County, Tennessee|Williamson County]], I-40 briefly enters a steep ascent, gaining a truck climbing lane on the eastbound side, and {{convert|6|mi|km}} beyond I-840 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 96|SR 96]], which connects to the Nashville suburbs of [[Fairview, Tennessee|Fairview]] and [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]. A few miles later, I-40 enters [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], and descends into the [[Nashville Basin]] between mile markers 186 and 188, and still in a predominantly rural area, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 248|SR 248]] in [[Kingston Springs, Tennessee|Kingston Springs]]. I-40 the crosses the [[Harpeth River]] twice over a distsnce of about {{convert|1|mi|km}}.\n\n====Nashville====\n[[File:Destinations from Interstate 40-65 (Exit 209, 209A, 209B) in Nashville.JPG|thumb|right|Destination sign for exit 209/209A/209B in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]]]\nAround milepost 191, I-40 enters [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and a few miles later crosses the Harpeth River for a third time. About a mile later, near\n[[Bellevue, Tennessee|Bellevue]], I-40 widens to six lanes, entering the urban outskirts of Nashville, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 70S|US 70S]]. Three miles later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 251|SR 251]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]), and {{convert|2|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US 70. Widening to eight lanes, three miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Pkwy, White Bridge Road), including the western terminus of the northern controlled-access beltway around Nashville. About two miles later is the western terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|I-440]], the southern loop around central Nashville. Two miles later, I-40 enters [[Downtown Nashville]], and begins a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|I-65]], turning southeast. As part of the route around downtown Nashville known locally as the Downtown Loop, the two concurrent routs have interchanges with US 70 (Charlotte Avenue) and US 70S/[[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|431]] (Broadway), as well as two surface streets, Church Street and Demonbreun Street. About two miles later the two concurrent routes turn east northeast, and I-65 splits off and heads south. Briefly on its own for about {{convert|1|mi|km}}, I-40 crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 31A|US 31A]]/[[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|41A]] (4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue), before beginning a brief concurrency with [[Interstate 24#Tennessee|I-24]] and turning southeast. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 splits off, and I-40 turns east. The eastern terminus of I-440 is also directly accessible from the east bound lanes of I-40 at this interchange, and [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], which crosses I-24 before this interchange, is also directly accessible from I-40 at this interchange.\n[[File:Interstate 40 @ Beckwith.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 near Mount Juliet, east of Nashville.]]\nAbout {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with SR 155 (Briley Parkway) near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and about a mile later, the eastbound lanes have a direct access partial-y exit to a surface road to the airport. The westbound lanes of I-40 are only accessible from this interchange. Less than a half mile later is an exit with [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]] (Donelson Pike), and beginning here, the left lanes of I-40 function as HOV lanes during rush hour. Passing near [[J. Percy Priest Dam]], I-40 has an interchange with Stewarts Ferry Pike, then crosses the [[Stones River]], and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] (Old Hickory Boulevard). Also at this interchange is a separate partial y interchange which provides access to SR 45 via a bypass which junctions with SR 45 about {{convert|3/4|mi|km}} north of I-40. This bypass is only accessible via the eastbound lanes of I-40, and the westbound lanes are only accessible from it. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 enters [[Wilson County, Tennessee|Wilson County]], and few miles later has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 171|SR 171]] near the Nashville suburb of [[Mount Juliet, Tennessee|Mount Juliet]]. Six miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 109|SR 109]], which connects to [[Gallatin, Tennessee|Gallatin]].  About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later and about {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of Nashville, the route narrows back to four lanes and has an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-840 a few miles east of [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]]. I-40 the enters Lebanon and has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 231|US 231]] and US 70.\n\n====Western Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau====\nFor the next roughly {{convert|50|mi|km}}, I-40 continues across mostly open farmland, passing near mostly small communities. About {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Lebanon, I-40 enters [[Smith County, Tennessee|Smith County]], and less than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later I-40 begins a steep ascent where the eastbound lanes gain a truck climbing lane. This lane terminates about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} later, and about {{convert|5.5|mi|km}} beyond this point is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 53|SR 53]] near [[Carthage, Tennessee|Carthage]] and [[Gordonsville, Tennessee|Gordonsville]]. Between mileposts 263 and 266, I-40 crosses the meandering [[Caney Fork River]] five times before crossing into [[Putnam County, Tennessee|Putnam County]] and beginning its ascent out of the [[Eastern Highland Rim]] onto the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. At milepost 268, I-40 has an interchange once again with SR 96, and a few miles later reaches an elevation of {{convert|1000|ft|m}} for the first time in the state near [[Silver Point, Tennessee|Silver Point]], and beginning at the edge of the table-top rim at mile marker 272 near [[Baxter, Tennessee|Baxter]], the interstate remains relatively flat across the plateau. I-40 then immediately has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 56|SR 56]] southbound/[[Tennessee State Route 141|SR 141]], which connect to [[Smithville, Tennessee|Smithville]] and [[McMinnville, Tennessee|McMinnville]]. Beginning a concurrency with SR 56 at this point, the latter route splits off {{convert|7|mi|km}} later, heading north towards [[Gainesboro, Tennessee|Gainesboro]]. Reaching [[Cookeville, Tennessee|Cookeville]] about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later, I-40 has a total of five interchanges,\nincluding with [[Tennessee State Route 111|SR 111]], a major north-south connector to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and US [[U.S. Route 70N|70N]]. Beginning a few miles beyond this point, I-40 begins another steep uphill ascent, protracted over a distance of about {{convert|5|mi}}, reaching an elevation of nearly {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}. Through this section, the speed limit reduces to 65 mph, and 55 mph for trucks on the westbound descent. Continuing through a predominantly wooded area, continues for about {{convert|10|mi|km}} through a predominantly wooded area, before reaching [[Monterey, Tennessee|Monterey]] a few miles later, where the route has two interchanges with US 70N, which contain concurrencies with [[Tennessee State Route 84|SR 84]] and [[Tennessee State Route 62|SR 62]], respectively. A short distance later, I-40 reaches an elevation of over {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} for the first time in Tennessee, before crossing into [[Cumberland County, Tennessee|Cumberland County]] and [[East Tennessee]] about {{convert|1/4|mi|km}}.\n\n===East Tennessee===\n\n====Cumberland Plateau and Tennessee Valley====\n[[File:Cumberland-plateau-i40-tn1.jpg|thumb|left|I-40 descending [[Walden Ridge]], miles 341\u2013346]]\n\nAfter ascending further up into the Walden Ridge/Cumberland Plateau and passing through Monterey, I-40 remains relatively flat and straight as it continues across the Cumberland Plateau. At mile 308, I-40 crosses the [[Tennessee Divide]], where the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]] watersheds meet. The divide is marked in the eastbound lanes with a sign reading \"Entering [[Emory River]] watershed.\" In the westbound counterparts is a sign noting the beginning of the Caney Fork watershed. About ten miles later, I-40 reaches [[Crossville, Tennessee|Crossville]], and has three interchanges, including one  with [[U.S. Route 127 in Tennessee|US 127]], which also conbects to [[Jamestown, Tennessee|Jamestown]]. \nEast of Crossville, the [[Crab Orchard Mountains]], the southern fringe of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to [[landslide|rockslide]]s. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-40 has an interchange with US 70 near the town of [[Crab Orchard, Tennessee|Crab Orchard]]. Beyond this point, the Interstate descends into a short depression before crossing into [[Roane County, Tennessee|Roane County]] and mile 340, entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]]. Shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the [[Tennessee Valley]] and the speed limit drops to 60&nbsp;mph in the eastbound lanes. I-40 hugs the slopes of the plateau's [[Walden Ridge]] escarpment for several miles, containing what some describe as dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south, before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between [[Harriman, Tennessee|Harriman]] and [[Rockwood, Tennessee|Rockwood]], and containing an interchange with [[U.S. Route 27 in Tennessee|US 27]]. As it enters the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians|Ridge-and-Valley]] province of the Appalachians, of which the Tennessee Valley is a part, I-40 crosses a series of ridges and valleys characteristic of the region's topography. About {{convert|4|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 29|SR 29]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, the road crosses the Clinch River, with the [[Kingston Fossil Plant]] and its {{convert|1,000|ft|m|adj=on}} twin smokestacks dominating the view to the north. About {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 58|SR 58]] southbound in [[Kingston, Tennessee|Kingston]], and at this point, I-40 begins a brief concurrency with SR 58. After ascending a short and relatively steep ridge out of the Clinch River Valley, SR 58 splits off to the north about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later, heading towards [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]]. Continuing through the relatively rugged terrain of the Great Appalachian Valley and crossing additional ridges, I-40 crosses into [[Loudon County, Tennessee|Loudon County]] about {{convert|7|mi|km}} later and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 321|US 321]]/[[Tennessee State Route 95|SR 95]] near Lenoir city, before reaching I-75 about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Knoxville====\n{{See also|Interstate 75 in Tennessee#Knoxville}}\n[[File:TN I40 East-I75 North West Knoxville.jpg|thumb|left|Interstate 40 concurrent with Interstate 75 in Knoxville]]\nAt exit 368, about 20 miles west southwest of downtown Knoxville, I-40 merges with [[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]], which continues to the southwest to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], and the two routes turn east northeast, carrying six through lanes, and cross into [[Knox County, Tennessee|Knox County]] a short distance later. Throughout this concurrency, exits are numbered according to I-40 mileage. The two highways pass through several of the western suburbs of Knoxville,  including [[Farragut, Tennessee|Farragut]], and have interchanges with a few surface streets. At exit 374 ([[Tennessee State Route 131|SR 131]]/Lovell Road), the highway widens to eight lanes and at the next exit, about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} later, is an interchange with the [[Pellissippi Parkway]] (SR 162 westbound, I-140 eastbound), which connects to Oak Ridge and [[Maryville, Tennessee|Maryville]], respectively. Continuing through western Knoxville, the two rputes have interchanges with additional surface streets, before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11 in Tennessee|US 11]]/70 {{convert|4|mi|km}} later near the [[West Hills, Knoxville|West Hills]] neighborhood. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 332|SR 332]] (Northshore Drive), and the separate Papermill Drive and Weisgarber Road. Two miles later, at exit 385, is an interchange with the western terminus of [[Interstate 640|I-640]], a beltway which passes northwest of downtown Knoxville. Also at this exit, I-75 splits off from I-40 onto a concurrency with I-640, splitting off a few miles later and heading towards [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The route then enters downtown Knoxville, containing a minimum of six through lanes through the entirety of central Knoxville, as well as several short segments of [[auxiliary lane]]s between exits. Passing near the main campus of the [[University of Tennessee]], as well as several residential neighborhoods, about \n{{convert|1.5|mi|km}} past I-640 is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 129 in Tennessee|US 129]], which connects to [[McGhee Tyson Airport]] and is a route to the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. One mile later is an interchange with SR 62 (Western Avenue), and a mile beyond this point is an interchange with [[Interstate 275 (Tennessee)|I-275]]. About {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later, in a complicated interchange, I-40 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 441 in Tennessee|US 441]] south (Henley Street), and begins a brief concurrency with this route, which splits off about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, along with [[Tennessee State Route 158|SR 158]] westbound, as controlled-access [[James White Parkway]]. I-40 then curves sharp north, and about {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} later, sharp east again before coming to an interchange with a connector road to US 441. I-40 then crosses a long viaduct, and has an interchange with a surface street before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11W|US 11W]] (Rutledge Pike). The highway then enters a predominantly residential area, passing next to the [[Knoxville Zoo]], before coming to an interchange with the eastern terminus of I-640 and leaving Knoxville less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later. Also at this interchange, I-40 begins a brief (unsigned) concurrency with [[U.S. Route 25W|US 25W]], which splits off a little over {{convert|1|mi|km}} later at an interchange with [[U.S. Route 11E|US 11E]]/70 (Asheville Highway). Leaving Knoxville, I-40 crosses the [[Holston River]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} later.\n\n====Smoky Mountains and Pigeon River gorge====\n[[File:Mount-cammerer-I40-tn1.jpg|thumb|right|I-40 near mile 441, with [[Mount Cammerer]] rising in the distance]]\nContinuing east as a six-lane highway, I-40 travels through a semi-rural residential area before crossing into [[Sevier County, Tennessee|Sevier County]]. A few miles later, at exit 407, near [[Sevierville, Tennessee|Sevierville]], I-40 has an interchange with the northern terminus of the [[Great Smoky Mountains Parkway]] ([[Tennessee State Route 66|SR 66]]). This interchange is the primary means of access to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, as well as the tourist attractions in the cities of Sevierville, [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee|Pigeon Forge]] and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], and, as a result, is reportedly one of the busiest and most congested non-interstate exits in the state. A few miles later, I-40 crosses into [[Jefferson County, Tennessee|Jefferson County]], and about {{convert|5|mi|km}} later is an interchange with US25W/70 in [[Dandridge, Tennessee|Dandridge]]. Two miles later is an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 92|SR 92]], also in Dandridge. Four miles later, at exit 421 is the interchange with the southern terminus of [[Interstate 81 in Tennessee|I-81]], which runs into [[Northeast Tennessee]] to the so called \"[[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]]\" of [[Bristol, Tennessee|Bristol]], [[Kingsport, Tennessee|Kingsport]], and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]]. At this interchange, I-40 reduces back to four lanes and turns sharp southeast, crossing the [[Douglas Dam]] impoundment of the [[French Broad River]] about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} later, as well as into [[Cocke County, Tennessee|Cocke County]]. About {{convert|6|mi|km}} later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 411 in Tennessee|US 411]]/70S/25 near [[Newport, Tennessee|Newport]]. Traveling along the northern base of English Mountain for a few miles, I-40 has an interchange with US 321 three miles later. About {{convert|5|mi|km}} later the road has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 73|SR 73]] near [[Cosby, Tennessee|Cosby]], and turns south through the gap between English Mountain and Stone Mountain, revealing a dramatic view of the {{convert|4928|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Mount Cammerer]] at the northeastern end of the Great Smokies range. Also at this point, I-40 enters thr [[Cherokee National Forest]] and proceeds into the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee\u2013North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] through the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], closely following the north bank of the river. This section is extremely curvy and the speed limit reduces to 55&nbsp;mph due to its susceptibility to accidents. This stretch is also prone to rockslides, and contains mesh nets along some of the cliff slopes as preventative measures. A few miles later I-40 crosses the Pigeon River and has an interchange with the [[Foothills Parkway]], before crossing the pigeon river again about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later and curving sharply to the east. A bout {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, the route curves to the south again near the unincorporated community of [[Hartford, Tennessee|Hartford]] before entering North Carolina about {{convert|4|mi|km}} later.\n\n===Music Highway===\nThe term '''Music Highway''' refers to a section of I-40 between Memphis and Nashville. I-40 was designated as such by an act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1997 \"from the eastern boundary of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] to the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]],\" a distance of about {{convert|222|mi|km}}. I-40 is designated as such because of the rich music history in Memphis, Nashville, and the areas in between. Memphis is known as \"the Home of the Blues and the Birthplace of Rock and Roll.\" Nashville is known as \"Music City USA\" for its influence on numerous types of music, especially [[Country music|country]]. Several cities and towns between the two, such as [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]], [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]], [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]], [[Waverly, Tennessee|Waverly]] and others were birthplaces or homes of numerous singers and songwriters. Signs that display the words \"Music Highway\" along with music notes are erected in both directions along I-40, especially at the borders of [[Shelby County, Tennessee|Shelby County]] and [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]].<ref name=MH>{{cite web |url = http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |title = Public Chapter 124 Senate Bill No. 122 |publisher = State of Tennessee |access-date = September 26, 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014104711/http://www.tn.gov/sos/acts/100/pub/Pubc0124.HTM |archive-date = October 14, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:I-40 EB-I-75 NB 1 mile to TN 332.jpg|thumb|left|[[Interstate 75 in Tennessee|I-75]] north running [[Concurrency (road)|concurrently]] with I-40 east in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]]]\n\n===Construction and early history===\n\nThe Tennessee leg of I-40 was part of the original {{convert|1047|mi|km}} of Interstate Highways authorized for Tennessee by the [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956]].

He lived at Kadlunga station, [[Mintaro, South Australia|Mintaro]], where he bred [[Merino sheep]], [[Jersey cattle]], and [[Percheron horse]]s. He also had an interest in Oakbank Station in South Australia and Williambury, in the [[Gascoyne River]] district of [[Western Australia]].\n\nHe was a longtime member of the District Council of Stanley and its chairman for twelve years, until its amalgamation with the District Council of Clare, and continued as a member of the larger council. He was involved in the establishment of the Clare and District Hospital, then after its incorporation in 1925 was on its board of management, including a stint as chairman. He was a director of Mintaro Slate and Flagstone Company.\nHe was a member of the council of the S.A.

[[Singaporean literature]] declares eating a national pastime and food a national obsession. Food is a frequent topic of conversation among Singaporeans. Religious dietary strictures do exist; Muslims do not eat pork and Hindus do not eat beef, and there is also a significant group of vegetarians/[[vegans]]. People from different communities often eat together, while being mindful of each other's culture and choosing food that is acceptable for all.\n\nOther than local Singaporean cuisine, it is also common in Singapore to find restaurants specialising in cuisine from a great variety of countries around the world.\n\n==Hawker centres==\n\nWhen dining out, Singaporeans often eat at [[hawker centre]]s, [[kopi tiam|coffee shops]] or [[food court]]s rather than restaurants, due to convenience, a wider range of options and affordability. These hawker centres are widespread, cheap and usually feature dozens of stalls in a single complex, with each stall offering its own speciality dishes. Well-known hawker centres among tourists include Telok Ayer Market, [https://www.best-singapore-guide.com/Lau-Pa-Sat.html Lau Pa Sat] and Newton Food Centre. Coffee shops are non-air conditioned versions of food courts and are commonly found island-wide, usually at the bottom of blocks of [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] [[apartment|flats]]. Hawker centres are the place where people can experience all kinds of different cultural food in one place. Hawker centres, or open air food courts, have come to define Singaporean food culture. Popular markets like Old Airport Road Food Centre in [[Geylang]], Golden Mile Food Centre on Beach Road and Maxwell Road Food Centre in [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]] offer the best of Chinese, Malaysian and Indian cooking, melded into foods that are uniquely Singaporean.<ref name=\"Sood, BBC Travel\">{{cite web|last1=Sood|first1=Suemedha|title=Singaporean Food's past and Present|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20101214-travelwise-singaporean-foods-past-and-present|publisher=BBC Travel|accessdate=22 June 2017|date=15 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, [[Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle]] and [[Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle]] became the first two street food locations in the world to be awarded a [[Michelin star]].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|last1=Kim|first1=Soo|title=Singapore street food stalls get Michelin stars|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/singapore/articles/singapore-street-food-stalls-get-michelin-star/|accessdate=8 August 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=25 July 2016}}</ref> The former also gained the title of the world's \"cheapest Michelin-starred meal\".<ref name=\"telegraph2\">{{cite news|last1=Han|first1=Kirsten|title=Michelin star for Singapore noodle stall where lunch is half the price of a Big Mac|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/04/michelin-star-for-singapore-noodle-stall-where-lunch-is-half-the-price-of-a-big-mac/|accessdate=8 August 2016|work=The Guardian|date=1 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Michelin3\">{{cite news|title=The world's first Michelin-starred hawker stall|url=https://guide.michelin.sg/behind-the-scenes-with-the-first-michelin-starred-hawker-in-the-world-singapore|accessdate=8 August 2016|work=The Guardian|date=1 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Singapore hawker culture was nominated by Singapore's National Heritage Board (NHB), National Environment Agency and Federation of Merchants' Associations Singapore for inscription into Unesco's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-hawker-culture-to-be-nominated-for-unesco-listing|title=Singapore hawker culture to be nominated for Unesco listing|last=hermes|date=2018-08-20|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref>\n\n==Singapore food internationally==\nSingaporean food is a significant cultural attraction for tourists and visitors. Some Singaporean dishes have become internationally known. In 2011, four Singaporean dishes were included in the list of 'World's 50 Most Delicious Foods (Readers' Pick)' \u2013 a worldwide online poll by 35,000 people held by [[CNN International]]. They are [[Hainanese chicken rice]] (13th), [[chili crab]] (29th), [[Katong Laksa]] (44th) and [[roti prata]] (45th).<ref name=\"CNNGo\">{{cite news | title = Your pick: World's 50 best foods | author = Tim Cheung | date = 7 September 2011 | publisher = CNNGo | url = http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/eat/readers-choice-worlds-50-most-delicious-foods-012321 | accessdate = 19 May 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121111184944/http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/eat/readers-choice-worlds-50-most-delicious-foods-012321 | archive-date = 11 November 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Anthony Bourdain]] brought international attention to local food available in hawker centres on his show, ''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations|No Reservations]]''.

Over the course of 8 videos he highlighted Singaporean street food, hawker centres, local buffets and restaurants. These videos have a combined view count of over 5.5&nbsp;million views.  \n\nSingaporean cuisine has been promoted as a tourist attraction by the [[Singapore Tourism Board]]. The [[Singapore Food Festival]], held every year in July, is a celebration of Singapore's cuisine. The Overseas Singaporean Unit also organises [[Singapore Day]] in major cities around the world as a platform for Singaporeans living abroad.<ref name=\"Singapore Day\">{{cite web|title=Singapore Day|url=http://www.singaporeday.sg/|website=Singaporeday.sg|accessdate=7 April 2013}}</ref> One of Singapore Day's major draws is the local Singaporean hawker food, which is prepared on-site by well-known hawkers specially flown in for the event.\n\n== Background and history ==\n\nSingapore is geographically located in between the Pacific and Indian oceans but it also has the shape of a peninsula and an island at the same time, where various cultures and trades used to and continue to occur. Indonesia is located to the south, Thailand, China, the Philippines and Malaysia are located to the north and India is located to the west. Since Singapore's position is between various Asian countries, there is a diversity in food and culture.<ref name=\"Sood, BBC Travel\" /> \"When Stamford Raffles sought to convert Singapore into a trading post for the East India Company in 1819, immigrants from China, Malaya, India, Indonesia, Europe, the United States and the Middle East flocked to the island.<ref name=\"Sood, BBC Travel\" /> The culture of Singapore is made up of diverse influences from different continents and countries. This led Singapore cuisine to be mixed-cultural society food. Like many other Asian countries, Singapore experienced a period of colonisation. Singapore used to be colonised by Britain from the early 19th century to the mid-20th century, and like most of Asian countries did, they were ruled by Japan during World War 2.<ref name=\"Tarulevicz\">{{cite book|last1=Tarulevicz|first1=Nicole|title=Eating Her Curries and Kway: A Cultural History of Food in Singapore|date=December 2013|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0252095368|page=11}}</ref> Colonisation of Japan also influenced Singaporean cuisine. For instance, ''[[Yusheng|yee sang]]'', which Singaporean Chinese enjoy eating during the [[Lunar New Year]], includes raw fish, which is a rare ingredient to put in dishes except for Japanese or Korean dishes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n== Food culture ==\n\nA common greeting for the Singaporean Chinese is the question \"Have you eaten?\", asked in the various Chinese dialects. It is one way to express a greeting to another person. It is also possible to assume that this is how Singaporeans think about the meal and food. Since Singapore is a mixed cultural nation there is a diverse range of people who might have different and restricted diets, such as Muslims and Hindus.<ref>\"Dining in Singapore.\" Dining in Singapore. InterNations, n.d. Web. 17 March 2016.</ref> Since Singapore is influenced by so many different regions, religion, and areas, there are also many events or anniversaries. During the [[Lunar New Year]], people eat [[nian gao]], which is originally from China, and is traditionally eaten around the Chinese New Year. Singapore's cuisine is as diverse as its culture. It is an extension of Malay cuisine but influenced by the Chinese \u2013 not to mention the Indians, Arabs, British and other settlers who have contributed to making Singapore one of the world's most important trading ports.{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Types of food and some world popular food ==\n\nSingaporean food can be divided into five types: meat, seafood, rice, noodles, and dessert or snacks. Singapore is especially renowned for its seafood. Chili crab and black pepper crab are two quintessential dishes that dominate the scene and are greatly recommended to tourists. Another favourite is sambal stingray. In the meat category, [[Hainanese chicken rice]] is the most popular dish. Essentially, it is rice cooked with chicken fat, served with boiled chicken, accompanied with chili sauce. Three noodle dishes stand out in Singapore cuisine. \"Fried Hokkien mee\", fried egg noodles with prawns, sliced pork and gravy, \"Nyonya laksa\", rice noodles served in a coconut prawn broth and \"Char Kuey Teow\", stir-fried rice noodles with prawns, Chinese sausage, lard and cockles. In the snack category, [[kaya toast]] is the representative dish, primarily due to the use of [[Coconut jam|kaya]]. \"Kaya kopitiams\" are a common sight on the island. These affordable coffee shops dish out bread toasts, spread with coconut egg jam and butter, served with coffee and tea as well as two soft [[Boiled egg]]s.\n\n==Common dishes and snacks==\n\n===Chinese===\n{{Cuisine of China}}\n[[File:Bakutteh.jpg|thumb|[[Bak kut teh]]]]\n[[File:Hainanese Chicken Rice.jpg|thumb|[[Hainanese chicken rice]] is considered one of the national dishes of Singapore]]\n[[File:Newton HokkienMee.JPG|thumb|[[Hokkien mee]]]]\n[[File:Singapore Beef Fried Rice by Banej.jpg|thumb|Beef fried rice topped with a sunny side up egg]]\n[[File:Kaya Toast with Coffee.jpg|thumb|[[Kaya toast]], a traditional breakfast dish]]\n\nThe dishes that comprise \"Singaporean Chinese cuisine\" today were originally brought to Singapore by the early southern Chinese immigrants ([[Fujian cuisine|Hokkien]], [[Teochew cuisine|Teochew]], [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]], [[Hakka cuisine|Hakka]] and [[Hainan cuisine|Hainanese]]). They were then adapted to suit the local availability of ingredients, while absorbing influences from Malay, Indian and other cooking traditions.\n\nMost of the names of Singaporean Chinese dishes were derived from dialects of southern China, [[Southern Min|Hokkien (Min Nan)]] being the most common. As there was no common system for transliterating these dialects into the Latin alphabet, it is common to see different variants on the same name for a single dish. For example, ''bah kut teh'' may also be spelt ''bak kut teh'', and ''char kway tiao'' may also be spelt ''char kuay teow''.\n* [[Bak kut teh]] ({{zh|c=\u8089\u9aa8\u8336|p=r\u00f2u g\u01d4 ch\u00e1|labels=no}}), pork rib soup made with a variety of Chinese herbs and spices.\n* [[Beef kway teow]] ({{zh|c=\u725b\u8089\u7cbf\u6761|p=ni\u00fa r\u00f2u gu\u01d2 ti\u00e1o|labels=no}}), flat rice noodles stir-fried with beef, served dry or with soup.\n* [[Zongzi|Bak chang]] ({{zh|c=\u8089\u7cbd|p=r\u00f2u z\u00f2ng|labels=no}}), glutinous rice dumplings, usually filled with pork, mushrooms and stewed egg, steamed in bamboo leaves. Although it is Chinese in origin, it is also a favourite in [[Peranakan cuisine]].\n* [[Bak Chor Mee]] ({{zh|c=\u8089\u811e\u9762|p=ro\u00f9 cu\u00f2 mi\u00e0n|l=minced pork noodles|labels=no}}), egg noodles with minced pork, braised mushroom, pork meatball and other ingredients, served dry or in soup.

[[Singaporean literature]] declares eating a national pastime and food a national obsession. Food is a frequent topic of conversation among Singaporeans. Religious dietary strictures do exist; Muslims do not eat pork and Hindus do not eat beef, and there is also a significant group of vegetarians/[[vegans]]. People from different communities often eat together, while being mindful of each other's culture and choosing food that is acceptable for all.\n\nOther than local Singaporean cuisine, it is also common in Singapore to find restaurants specialising in cuisine from a great variety of countries around the world.\n\n==Hawker centres==\n\nWhen dining out, Singaporeans often eat at [[hawker centre]]s, [[kopi tiam|coffee shops]] or [[food court]]s rather than restaurants, due to convenience, a wider range of options and affordability. These hawker centres are widespread, cheap and usually feature dozens of stalls in a single complex, with each stall offering its own speciality dishes. Well-known hawker centres among tourists include Telok Ayer Market, [https://www.best-singapore-guide.com/Lau-Pa-Sat.html Lau Pa Sat] and Newton Food Centre. Coffee shops are non-air conditioned versions of food courts and are commonly found island-wide, usually at the bottom of blocks of [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] [[apartment|flats]]. Hawker centres are the place where people can experience all kinds of different cultural food in one place. Hawker centres, or open air food courts, have come to define Singaporean food culture. Popular markets like Old Airport Road Food Centre in [[Geylang]], Golden Mile Food Centre on Beach Road and Maxwell Road Food Centre in [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]] offer the best of Chinese, Malaysian and Indian cooking, melded into foods that are uniquely Singaporean.<ref name=\"Sood, BBC Travel\">{{cite web|last1=Sood|first1=Suemedha|title=Singaporean Food's past and Present|url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20101214-travelwise-singaporean-foods-past-and-present|publisher=BBC Travel|accessdate=22 June 2017|date=15 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, [[Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodle]] and [[Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle]] became the first two street food locations in the world to be awarded a [[Michelin star]].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|last1=Kim|first1=Soo|title=Singapore street food stalls get Michelin stars|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/singapore/articles/singapore-street-food-stalls-get-michelin-star/|accessdate=8 August 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=25 July 2016}}</ref> The former also gained the title of the world's \"cheapest Michelin-starred meal\".<ref name=\"telegraph2\">{{cite news|last1=Han|first1=Kirsten|title=Michelin star for Singapore noodle stall where lunch is half the price of a Big Mac|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/04/michelin-star-for-singapore-noodle-stall-where-lunch-is-half-the-price-of-a-big-mac/|accessdate=8 August 2016|work=The Guardian|date=1 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Michelin3\">{{cite news|title=The world's first Michelin-starred hawker stall|url=https://guide.michelin.sg/behind-the-scenes-with-the-first-michelin-starred-hawker-in-the-world-singapore|accessdate=8 August 2016|work=The Guardian|date=1 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Singapore hawker culture was nominated by Singapore's National Heritage Board (NHB), National Environment Agency and Federation of Merchants' Associations Singapore for inscription into Unesco's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-hawker-culture-to-be-nominated-for-unesco-listing|title=Singapore hawker culture to be nominated for Unesco listing|last=hermes|date=2018-08-20|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2019-01-18}}</ref>\n\n==Singapore food internationally==\nSingaporean food is a significant cultural attraction for tourists and visitors.

Over the course of 8 videos he highlighted Singaporean street food, hawker centres, local buffets and restaurants. These videos have a combined view count of over 5.5&nbsp;million views.  \n\nSingaporean cuisine has been promoted as a tourist attraction by the [[Singapore Tourism Board]]. The [[Singapore Food Festival]], held every year in July, is a celebration of Singapore's cuisine. The Overseas Singaporean Unit also organises [[Singapore Day]] in major cities around the world as a platform for Singaporeans living abroad.<ref name=\"Singapore Day\">{{cite web|title=Singapore Day|url=http://www.singaporeday.sg/|website=Singaporeday.sg|accessdate=7 April 2013}}</ref> One of Singapore Day's major draws is the local Singaporean hawker food, which is prepared on-site by well-known hawkers specially flown in for the event.\n\n== Background and history ==\n\nSingapore is geographically located in between the Pacific and Indian oceans but it also has the shape of a peninsula and an island at the same time, where various cultures and trades used to and continue to occur. Indonesia is located to the south, Thailand, China, the Philippines and Malaysia are located to the north and India is located to the west. Since Singapore's position is between various Asian countries, there is a diversity in food and culture.<ref name=\"Sood, BBC Travel\" /> \"When Stamford Raffles sought to convert Singapore into a trading post for the East India Company in 1819, immigrants from China, Malaya, India, Indonesia, Europe, the United States and the Middle East flocked to the island.<ref name=\"Sood, BBC Travel\" /> The culture of Singapore is made up of diverse influences from different continents and countries. This led Singapore cuisine to be mixed-cultural society food. Like many other Asian countries, Singapore experienced a period of colonisation. Singapore used to be colonised by Britain from the early 19th century to the mid-20th century, and like most of Asian countries did, they were ruled by Japan during World War 2.<ref name=\"Tarulevicz\">{{cite book|last1=Tarulevicz|first1=Nicole|title=Eating Her Curries and Kway: A Cultural History of Food in Singapore|date=December 2013|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0252095368|page=11}}</ref> Colonisation of Japan also influenced Singaporean cuisine. For instance, ''[[Yusheng|yee sang]]'', which Singaporean Chinese enjoy eating during the [[Lunar New Year]], includes raw fish, which is a rare ingredient to put in dishes except for Japanese or Korean dishes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n== Food culture ==\n\nA common greeting for the Singaporean Chinese is the question \"Have you eaten?\", asked in the various Chinese dialects. It is one way to express a greeting to another person. It is also possible to assume that this is how Singaporeans think about the meal and food. Since Singapore is a mixed cultural nation there is a diverse range of people who might have different and restricted diets, such as Muslims and Hindus.<ref>\"Dining in Singapore.\" Dining in Singapore. InterNations, n.d. Web. 17 March 2016.</ref> Since Singapore is influenced by so many different regions, religion, and areas, there are also many events or anniversaries. During the [[Lunar New Year]], people eat [[nian gao]], which is originally from China, and is traditionally eaten around the Chinese New Year. Singapore's cuisine is as diverse as its culture. It is an extension of Malay cuisine but influenced by the Chinese \u2013 not to mention the Indians, Arabs, British and other settlers who have contributed to making Singapore one of the world's most important trading ports.{{cn|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Types of food and some world popular food ==\n\nSingaporean food can be divided into five types: meat, seafood, rice, noodles, and dessert or snacks. Singapore is especially renowned for its seafood. Chili crab and black pepper crab are two quintessential dishes that dominate the scene and are greatly recommended to tourists. Another favourite is sambal stingray. In the meat category, [[Hainanese chicken rice]] is the most popular dish. Essentially, it is rice cooked with chicken fat, served with boiled chicken, accompanied with chili sauce. Three noodle dishes stand out in Singapore cuisine. \"Fried Hokkien mee\", fried egg noodles with prawns, sliced pork and gravy, \"Nyonya laksa\", rice noodles served in a coconut prawn broth and \"Char Kuey Teow\", stir-fried rice noodles with prawns, Chinese sausage, lard and cockles. In the snack category, [[kaya toast]] is the representative dish, primarily due to the use of [[Coconut jam|kaya]]. \"Kaya kopitiams\" are a common sight on the island. These affordable coffee shops dish out bread toasts, spread with coconut egg jam and butter, served with coffee and tea as well as two soft [[Boiled egg]]s.\n\n==Common dishes and snacks==\n\n===Chinese===\n{{Cuisine of China}}\n[[File:Bakutteh.jpg|thumb|[[Bak kut teh]]]]\n[[File:Hainanese Chicken Rice.jpg|thumb|[[Hainanese chicken rice]] is considered one of the national dishes of Singapore]]\n[[File:Newton HokkienMee.JPG|thumb|[[Hokkien mee]]]]\n[[File:Singapore Beef Fried Rice by Banej.jpg|thumb|Beef fried rice topped with a sunny side up egg]]\n[[File:Kaya Toast with Coffee.jpg|thumb|[[Kaya toast]], a traditional breakfast dish]]\n\nThe dishes that comprise \"Singaporean Chinese cuisine\" today were originally brought to Singapore by the early southern Chinese immigrants ([[Fujian cuisine|Hokkien]], [[Teochew cuisine|Teochew]], [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]], [[Hakka cuisine|Hakka]] and [[Hainan cuisine|Hainanese]]). They were then adapted to suit the local availability of ingredients, while absorbing influences from Malay, Indian and other cooking traditions.\n\nMost of the names of Singaporean Chinese dishes were derived from dialects of southern China, [[Southern Min|Hokkien (Min Nan)]] being the most common. As there was no common system for transliterating these dialects into the Latin alphabet, it is common to see different variants on the same name for a single dish. For example, ''bah kut teh'' may also be spelt ''bak kut teh'', and ''char kway tiao'' may also be spelt ''char kuay teow''.\n* [[Bak kut teh]] ({{zh|c=\u8089\u9aa8\u8336|p=r\u00f2u g\u01d4 ch\u00e1|labels=no}}), pork rib soup made with a variety of Chinese herbs and spices.\n* [[Beef kway teow]] ({{zh|c=\u725b\u8089\u7cbf\u6761|p=ni\u00fa r\u00f2u gu\u01d2 ti\u00e1o|labels=no}}), flat rice noodles stir-fried with beef, served dry or with soup.\n* [[Zongzi|Bak chang]] ({{zh|c=\u8089\u7cbd|p=r\u00f2u z\u00f2ng|labels=no}}), glutinous rice dumplings, usually filled with pork, mushrooms and stewed egg, steamed in bamboo leaves.

Usually the flat, tape-like [[mee pok]] noodle is used.\n* [[Ban mian]] ({{zh|c=\u677f\u9762|p=b\u01cen mi\u00e0n|labels=no}}), hand-made flat noodles served with vegetables, minced meat, sliced mushrooms, and an egg in an [[Anchovy (food)|anchovy]]-based soup. Noodle variations are common. \"Ban mian\" refers to flat, long noodles; \"mee hoon kuay\" ({{zh|c=\u7c73\u7c89\u7cbf|p=m\u00ed f\u011bn gu\u01d2|l=rice vermicelli cake|labels=no}}) refers to flat, rectangular noodles; \"you mian\" ({{zh|c=\u5e7c\u9762|p=y\u00f2u mi\u00e0n|l=thin noodles|labels=no}}) refers to thin noodles.\n* [[Chai tow kway]] ({{zh|c=\u83dc\u5934\u7cbf|p=c\u00e0i t\u00f3u gu\u01d2|labels=no}}), also known as char kway ({{zh|c=\u7092\u7cbf|p=ch\u01ceo gu\u01d2|labels=no}}) or carrot cake, is a dish of steamed [[radish]]/[[daikon]] cakes diced and stir-fried with garlic, egg, chopped preserved radish, and sometimes with shrimp.

Its main resources are spring water, gold and [[wood]] products, including [[paper]]. In 2012, Quebec Lithium Corp. re-opened Canada's first [[lithium]] mine, which had operated as an underground mine from 1955&ndash;65. They are planning to carve an open pit mine over [[pegmatite]] dikes. (The pegmatite is about 1% lithium carbonate.)

Abitibi itself was then annexed to the province in Quebec on June 13, 1898, by an act of the federal Parliament.\n\nAmos was the first colonisation point for the region of [[Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue|Abitibi]], with colonization beginning in 1910. The municipality was established in 1914 while the city itself was chartered in 1925. The name of the city came from the maiden name of the wife of Sir [[Lomer Gouin]], then premier of Quebec.\n\nA related municipality was created in 1917 under the name 'Municipalit\u00e9 de la partie ouest des cantons unis de Figuery et Dalquier' (Municipality of the western part of the united townships of Figuery and Dalquier) which changed its name to Amos-Ouest in 1949. In 1974 the municipality fused with the city of Amos proper. Another related municipality was created in 1918 under the name 'Municipalit\u00e9 de la partie est des cantons Figuery et Dalquier' (Municipality of the eastern part of the united townships of Figuery and Dalquier), which also changed its name later 1950 to Amos-Est. The municipality was finally integrated into the city of Amos itself in 1987.\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Ulrick Ch\u00e9rubin-09-08-2014-4.JPG|thumb|left|Former mayor Ulrick Ch\u00e9rubin during an event associated with Amos' centennial celebration.]]\nThe current mayor of the city is S\u00e9bastien D'Astous, who took office on February 20, 2015, after winning a [[by-election]]<ref>[http://www.lechoabitibien.ca/2015/02/15/dastous-gagne-le-coeur-des-amossois \"D'Astous gagne le c\u0153ur des Amossois\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216085351/http://www.lechoabitibien.ca/2015/02/15/dastous-gagne-le-coeur-des-amossois |date=2015-02-16 }}.

It is the seat of [[Abitibi Regional County Municipality]].\n\nAmos is the main town on the Harricana River, and the smallest of the three primary towns \u2014 after [[Rouyn-Noranda]] and [[Val-d'Or]] \u2014 in the [[Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue]] region of Quebec. Its main resources are spring water, gold and [[wood]] products, including [[paper]]. In 2012, Quebec Lithium Corp. re-opened Canada's first [[lithium]] mine, which had operated as an underground mine from 1955&ndash;65. They are planning to carve an open pit mine over [[pegmatite]] dikes. (The pegmatite is about 1% lithium carbonate.) The mine is about {{convert|60|km|mi}} north of Val-d'Or, {{convert|38|km|mi}} southeast of Amos, and {{convert|15|km|mi}} km west of [[Barraute, Quebec|Barraute]]. It is in the northeast corner of [[La Corne, Quebec|La Corne]] Township. Access to the mine is via paved road from Val d'Or.<ref name=CanLith>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.canadalithium.com/s/QuebecLithium.asp\n |accessdate   = 2013-03-07\n |title        = Quebec Lithium\n |publisher    = Canada Lithium Corp.\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130310044550/http://www.canadalithium.com/s/QuebecLithium.asp\n |archive-date = 2013-03-10\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nThe smaller communities of Lac-Gauvin and Saint-Maurice-de-Dalquier are also within the municipal boundaries of Amos.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:\u00c9glise d'Amos.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[St. Teresa of Avila Cathedral, Amos|The Amos Roman Catholic Cathedral]]]]\n[[Rupert's Land]], in which Abitibi was located, was owned by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and was bought by Canada in 1869. Abitibi itself was then annexed to the province in Quebec on June 13, 1898, by an act of the federal Parliament.\n\nAmos was the first colonisation point for the region of [[Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue|Abitibi]], with colonization beginning in 1910. The municipality was established in 1914 while the city itself was chartered in 1925. The name of the city came from the maiden name of the wife of Sir [[Lomer Gouin]], then premier of Quebec.\n\nA related municipality was created in 1917 under the name 'Municipalit\u00e9 de la partie ouest des cantons unis de Figuery et Dalquier' (Municipality of the western part of the united townships of Figuery and Dalquier) which changed its name to Amos-Ouest in 1949. In 1974 the municipality fused with the city of Amos proper. Another related municipality was created in 1918 under the name 'Municipalit\u00e9 de la partie est des cantons Figuery et Dalquier' (Municipality of the eastern part of the united townships of Figuery and Dalquier), which also changed its name later 1950 to Amos-Est. The municipality was finally integrated into the city of Amos itself in 1987.\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Ulrick Ch\u00e9rubin-09-08-2014-4.JPG|thumb|left|Former mayor Ulrick Ch\u00e9rubin during an event associated with Amos' centennial celebration.]]\nThe current mayor of the city is S\u00e9bastien D'Astous, who took office on February 20, 2015, after winning a [[by-election]]<ref>[http://www.lechoabitibien.ca/2015/02/15/dastous-gagne-le-coeur-des-amossois \"D'Astous gagne le c\u0153ur des Amossois\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216085351/http://www.lechoabitibien.ca/2015/02/15/dastous-gagne-le-coeur-des-amossois |date=2015-02-16 }}.
