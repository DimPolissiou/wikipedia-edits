Following the award of the franchise to London Midland, they placed an order for two PPM60 units with Parry People Movers, through [[Porterbrook]], with the service itself operated for them by [[Pre Metro Operations]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=PPMs ordered for Stourbridge branch |magazine=Rail |issue=581 |date=19 December 2007 |page=20}}</ref>\n\nThese two units are 139 001 and 139 002, composed of vehicle numbers 39001 and 39002 in the British carriage and wagon numbering and classification system. The vehicles are mechanically similar to 999 900, but are approximately one metre longer. They were intended to start operating on the Stourbridge Town branch in 2008. In January 2009 it was confirmed that 139001 was still undergoing testing at Chasewater Railway and 139002 was still not completed.\n\nDespite the difficulties in the commissioning of the two Class 139 units, London Midland consistently outlined its faith that they would be ready to enter service. In March 2009, it was announced that the first unit had received its passenger certification from Network Rail, allowing it to carry passengers. London Midland stated that they would begin a phased entry into service, starting with weekend operation in April, leading up to a full service by the timetable change in May 2009. Until then, London Midland temporarily returned a Class 153 to operating the branch service. 139 002 officially entered service on 29 March 2009 as part of the type's phased entry. This unit had previously worked in full service, including all-day on Monday 11 May 2009 and previously had worked all morning services during February/March 2009. In May 2009 the first unit, 139 001 was finally delivered to Stourbridge, with 999 900 removed at the same time.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Class 139s enter service at Stourbridge |magazine=[[The Railway Magazine]] |issue=1301 |date=September 2009 |page=139}}</ref> Test unit 999 900 had been on the branch line between 2005\u20132009. At the point of introduction, they displaced a single Class 153 DMU that was previously allocated to the branch line. By December 2009, the 200,000th passenger had been carried by the railcars.\n\n====Class 153, 170 and 172 DMUs====\n\nWest Midlands Trains operate a total of 35 two-car and three-car Class 172 units, 27 of which had been ordered by predecessor London Midland, who originally planned for them to enter service by the end of 2010 on services to and from Birmingham Snow Hill, replacing Class 150s. The original 27 sets have revised front ends with end gangways which make the trains look like the Electrostar family of units.\n\nFrom 1 September 2011, the Class 172s started operating on the Snow Hill Lines with some weekend work from Birmingham - Hereford. When first used in service, the units suffered a fault with engine vibration in the passenger cabin, which has since been rectified.\n\nThe units were originally meant to replace all of the Class 150s, however three were retained until 2019 and moved on to Northern after the Class 172/0 and Class 230 units entered service. Between late 2018 and early 2019 West Midlands Railway, operated by West Midlands Trains, inherited the London Overground 172/0s to replace the remaining Class 150s and Class 153s operating on the Coventry\u2013Leamington line, the Coventry to Nuneaton line and Birmingham- Hereford. All had entered service by May 2019.\n\n====Class 230 ''D-Train''====\nWest Midlands Trains are also the first operator of the [[British Rail Class 230|Class 230]], a new class of [[diesel electric multiple unit]] that are [[Upcycling|upcycled]] [[London Underground D78 Stock]].

Following the award of the franchise to London Midland, they placed an order for two PPM60 units with Parry People Movers, through [[Porterbrook]], with the service itself operated for them by [[Pre Metro Operations]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=PPMs ordered for Stourbridge branch |magazine=Rail |issue=581 |date=19 December 2007 |page=20}}</ref>\n\nThese two units are 139 001 and 139 002, composed of vehicle numbers 39001 and 39002 in the British carriage and wagon numbering and classification system. The vehicles are mechanically similar to 999 900, but are approximately one metre longer. They were intended to start operating on the Stourbridge Town branch in 2008. In January 2009 it was confirmed that 139001 was still undergoing testing at Chasewater Railway and 139002 was still not completed.\n\nDespite the difficulties in the commissioning of the two Class 139 units, London Midland consistently outlined its faith that they would be ready to enter service. In March 2009, it was announced that the first unit had received its passenger certification from Network Rail, allowing it to carry passengers. London Midland stated that they would begin a phased entry into service, starting with weekend operation in April, leading up to a full service by the timetable change in May 2009. Until then, London Midland temporarily returned a Class 153 to operating the branch service. 139 002 officially entered service on 29 March 2009 as part of the type's phased entry. This unit had previously worked in full service, including all-day on Monday 11 May 2009 and previously had worked all morning services during February/March 2009. In May 2009 the first unit, 139 001 was finally delivered to Stourbridge, with 999 900 removed at the same time.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Class 139s enter service at Stourbridge |magazine=[[The Railway Magazine]] |issue=1301 |date=September 2009 |page=139}}</ref> Test unit 999 900 had been on the branch line between 2005\u20132009. At the point of introduction, they displaced a single Class 153 DMU that was previously allocated to the branch line. By December 2009, the 200,000th passenger had been carried by the railcars.\n\n====Class 153, 170 and 172 DMUs====\n\nWest Midlands Trains operate a total of 35 two-car and three-car Class 172 units, 27 of which had been ordered by predecessor London Midland, who originally planned for them to enter service by the end of 2010 on services to and from Birmingham Snow Hill, replacing Class 150s. The original 27 sets have revised front ends with end gangways which make the trains look like the Electrostar family of units.\n\nFrom 1 September 2011, the Class 172s started operating on the Snow Hill Lines with some weekend work from Birmingham - Hereford. When first used in service, the units suffered a fault with engine vibration in the passenger cabin, which has since been rectified.\n\nThe units were originally meant to replace all of the Class 150s, however three were retained until 2019 and moved on to Northern after the Class 172/0 and Class 230 units entered service. Between late 2018 and early 2019 West Midlands Railway, operated by West Midlands Trains, inherited the London Overground 172/0s to replace the remaining Class 150s and Class 153s operating on the Coventry\u2013Leamington line, the Coventry to Nuneaton line and Birmingham- Hereford. All had entered service by May 2019.\n\n====Class 230 ''D-Train''====\nWest Midlands Trains are also the first operator of the [[British Rail Class 230|Class 230]], a new class of [[diesel electric multiple unit]] that are [[Upcycling|upcycled]] [[London Underground D78 Stock]].

These trains have a maximum speed of {{convert|100|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe Class 172/2s and 172/3s used by West Midlands Trains resemble the {{brc|375}}, {{brc|377}}, {{brc|379}} and {{brc|387}} ''Electrostars'' by having end gangways to allow access between units.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cw-railpic.fpic.co.uk/p68624467.html| publisher=Published Railways Illustrated Issue March 2011| title=London Midlands Class 172/3 DMU, 172331, 5Z72 Derby Litchurch Lane - Old Dalby}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> These trains have a maximum speed of {{convert|100|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"trc-tech\">{{cite web|url=http://www.therailwaycentre.com/New%20DMU%20Tech%20Data%20/DMU_172.html|title=therailwaycentre.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe Class 172s feature BSI (Bergische Stahl Industrie - Autocoupler) couplers which allow them to work in multiple with {{brc|168}}, {{brc|170}} units and most other units with the same coupler.\n\n===Differences from other Turbostars===\nThe Class 172 trains are lighter than other Turbostars due to use of the Bombardier FLEXX-ECO [[bogies]] - a development of the B5000 [[bogies]] used on the [[British Rail Class 220|Class 220 ''Voyager'']] DEMU trains, rather than the previous 'Series 3' bogies.<ref>[http://londonconnections.blogspot.com/2007/07/gospel-oak-to-barking-improvement.html Gospel Oak to Barking improvement details].</ref> Another difference is that they have half-height airdams as opposed to the more standard full height airdams. They also differ from earlier Turbostars in having [[mechanical transmission]] rather than [[Hydrokinetic transmission|hydraulic]] - gear changes can be distinctly heard as the trains accelerate and decelerate.\n===Differences from Class 150===\nClass 172s have fewer seats than the {{brc|150}}s they replace,<ref name=\"trc-tech\" />  but greater overall capacity due to the increased room for standing passengers as well as wider aisles intended to speed boarding and alighting and reduce waiting time in stations. The trains are air-conditioned and have no opening windows, unlike the Class 150s.\n\nThe Class 172 is designed to a {{Convert|23|m|ftin|abbr=on|adj=on}} body length, as opposed to the {{Convert|20|m|ftin|abbr=on|adj=on}} length used on previous Class 150 Sprinter DMUs - increasing capacity.\n\n==Operators==\n===West Midlands Trains===\n[[File:WMR Class172 at Nuneaton, 6.19.jpg|thumb|right|172008 at {{rws|Nuneaton}} in 2019.

two-car, non-gangway train sets with [[West Midlands Trains]] for use on the [[Coventry\u2013Leamington line|Leamington Spa ]] to [[Coventry to Nuneaton line|Nuneaton]] and [[Snow Hill Lines]] \n* Class 172/1 - two-car, non-gangway train sets with [[Chiltern Railways]] for use on the [[Chiltern Main Line]].\n* Class 172/2 - two-car, gangway train sets with [[West Midlands Trains]] for use on the [[Snow Hill Lines]] and [[Coventry\u2013Leamington line|Leamington Spa]] to [[Coventry to Nuneaton line|Nuneaton]].\n* Class 172/3 - three-car, gangway train sets with [[West Midlands Trains]] for use on the [[Snow Hill Lines]] and [[Coventry\u2013Leamington line|Leamington Spa]] to [[Coventry to Nuneaton line|Nuneaton]].\n\nThe 172/0s and 172/1s resemble the existing ''Turbostar'' trains in not having end gangways. These trains have a maximum speed of {{convert|100|mph|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe Class 172/2s and 172/3s used by West Midlands Trains resemble the {{brc|375}}, {{brc|377}}, {{brc|379}} and {{brc|387}} ''Electrostars'' by having end gangways to allow access between units.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cw-railpic.fpic.co.uk/p68624467.html| publisher=Published Railways Illustrated Issue March 2011| title=London Midlands Class 172/3 DMU, 172331, 5Z72 Derby Litchurch Lane - Old Dalby}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> These trains have a maximum speed of {{convert|100|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"trc-tech\">{{cite web|url=http://www.therailwaycentre.com/New%20DMU%20Tech%20Data%20/DMU_172.html|title=therailwaycentre.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe Class 172s feature BSI (Bergische Stahl Industrie - Autocoupler) couplers which allow them to work in multiple with {{brc|168}}, {{brc|170}} units and most other units with the same coupler.\n\n===Differences from other Turbostars===\nThe Class 172 trains are lighter than other Turbostars due to use of the Bombardier FLEXX-ECO [[bogies]] - a development of the B5000 [[bogies]] used on the [[British Rail Class 220|Class 220 ''Voyager'']] DEMU trains, rather than the previous 'Series 3' bogies.<ref>[http://londonconnections.blogspot.com/2007/07/gospel-oak-to-barking-improvement.html Gospel Oak to Barking improvement details].</ref> Another difference is that they have half-height airdams as opposed to the more standard full height airdams. They also differ from earlier Turbostars in having [[mechanical transmission]] rather than [[Hydrokinetic transmission|hydraulic]] - gear changes can be distinctly heard as the trains accelerate and decelerate.\n===Differences from Class 150===\nClass 172s have fewer seats than the {{brc|150}}s they replace,<ref name=\"trc-tech\" />  but greater overall capacity due to the increased room for standing passengers as well as wider aisles intended to speed boarding and alighting and reduce waiting time in stations. The trains are air-conditioned and have no opening windows, unlike the Class 150s.\n\nThe Class 172 is designed to a {{Convert|23|m|ftin|abbr=on|adj=on}} body length, as opposed to the {{Convert|20|m|ftin|abbr=on|adj=on}} length used on previous Class 150 Sprinter DMUs - increasing capacity.\n\n==Operators==\n===West Midlands Trains===\n[[File:WMR Class172 at Nuneaton, 6.19.jpg|thumb|right|172008 at {{rws|Nuneaton}} in 2019.

The vehicles work on the southern regions of the British railway system, operating services from London Bridge to Uckfield and from Eastbourne to Ashford International, these routes being unelectrified between Hurst Green Junction and Uckfield and Ore and Ashford International, respectively.\n\nThe fleet are operated by [[Govia Thameslink Railway|Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) ]] for [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]] services.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Turbostarcouplers.png|thumb|left|450px|Class 170 on the left has a BSI 'Compact' coupler whereas Class 171 on the right has a [[Railway coupling#Dellner|Dellner coupler]].]]\n\nThe Southern fleet is fitted with coupling devices ([[Railway coupling#Dellner|Dellner]]) different from other Turbostars, and is classified as '''Class 171''' for this reason.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.semgonline.com/gallery/class171_01.html|title=Class 171|website=Southern Railway E-Group|accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref> The four-car units were built with the new couplers, but [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] two-car units were fitted at a later date, and reclassified as '''Class 171/7''' after the modification. Three more two-car units were later acquired, but these were built from new with the new couplers.\n\nSouthern gained the 170 392 unit from [[South West Trains]]. The coupler on this unit has also been changed to the Dellner type. The unit has been reclassified and renumbered from 170 392 to 171 730. This unit was first delivered carrying Southern livery and the number 170 727 (because SWT needed another 170 and it was cheaper to place another unit on the Southern order than place a new order). It never operated in this form and was transferred to South West Trains where it became 170 392.\n\nThese trains have electronic onboard displays and automated next station announcements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/passenger_services/disabled_passengers/southern_ontrain_facilities.html|title=Southern On Train Facilities|website=National Rail|accessdate=10 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Seating==\nClass 171s have mainly standard-class seating plus either nine first-class seats on a two-car or 18 on a four-car; all first-class seats are reclining and have [[Alternating current|AC]] power sockets adjacent to the seats.\n\nStandard-class seating includes five full-size folding seats in the area by the universal toilet on the DMOCL(W) vehicle. With these seats folded there is room for wheelchair users and bicycles. Each passenger door vestibule area also has two [[flip-down seat]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=2|''' '''\n!colspan=4|'''Standard Class'''\n!rowspan=2|'''1st Class'''\n!rowspan=2|'''TOTAL'''\n\n|-\n!

Services on the {{Stnlnk|Oxted}} to {{Stnlnk|Uckfield}} branch of the [[Oxted Line]] were later also transferred to Turbostar operation. Services from [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] to Uckfield went over to Turbostar operation in late 2004.\n\nThe Ashford-Eastbourne service, as well as peak-time Ashford-Rye and Ashford-Hastings shuttle services, are nearly always operated by the two-car Class 171/7; the four-car Class 171/8 units occasionally appear on the route during special events such as the Rye bonfire celebrations.\n\nThe Uckfield-London Bridge and Uckfield-Oxted services use both the two-car and the four-car units. These units are often coupled together, forming 6-car, 8-car or 10-car trains following platform extensions at Uckfield line stations.\n\n==Future==\nTwelve units (including the ex-Scotrail 170/4 examples) are scheduled to move to [[East Midlands Railway]] and be converted to [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170s]] with their carriage configuration also being changed to create 2 and 3 car units in 2021.<ref name=TRUK214>A New Era for the East Midlands as Abellio starts its fifth franchise ''[[Today's Railways UK]]'' issue 214 October 2019 page 26</ref><ref>Replacements sought for 171s ''[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]'' issue 889 9 October 2019 page 29</ref>\n\n==Fleet details==\n[[File:171803 First Class Interior.jpg|thumb|right|First Class section of a Southern Class 171]]\nInitial deliveries took place when the original 2-car units, at the time classified as Class 170/7, entered service in 2003, followed by the 4-car Class 171/8 units in 2004. At this time, the 2-car sets received their Dellner couplings and were reclassified as Class 171/7. In 2015, four 3-car Class 170/4 units were transferred to Southern from [[First ScotRail]] to enhance the fleet; two of these had the centre car removed and added to the remaining two, to form a pair of 2-car and a pair of 4-car units. With the addition of Dellner couplings, the new units were reclassified as Class 171/2 and 171/4.\n\nFormation of 2-Car Class 171/7: DMOCL(W) + DMOSL\n<br>\nFormation of 4-Car Class 171/8: DMOCL(W) + MOS + MOS + DMOCL\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
