The hurricane season officially began on June 1, and ended on November 30. It was slightly above average due to a [[La Ni\u00f1a]] weather pattern although most of the storms were weak. The first cyclone, Tropical Depression One, developed in the southern [[Gulf of Mexico]] on June 7 and dissipated after an uneventful duration. However, it would be almost two months before the first named storm, [[Hurricane Alberto (2000)|Alberto]], formed near [[Cape Verde]]; Alberto also dissipated with no effects on land. Several other tropical cyclones\u2014Tropical Depression Two, Tropical Depression Four, Chris, Ernesto, Nadine, and an unnamed subtropical storm\u2014did not impact land. Five additional storms\u2014Tropical Depression Nine, [[Hurricane Florence (2000)|Florence]], [[Hurricane Isaac (2000)|Isaac]], [[Hurricane Joyce (2000)|Joyce]], and [[Tropical Storm Leslie (2000)|Leslie]]\u2014minimally affected land areas.\n\nThe most significant storm of the season was [[Hurricane Keith]], which caused extensive damage in [[Central America]]. After remaining nearly stationary offshore, Keith moved inland over the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] and later made a second landfall in Mexico at hurricane intensity. It caused $319 million (2000 USD) in damage and 40 fatalities, mostly in [[Belize]]. The precursor to Tropical Storm Leslie brought severe flooding to [[South Florida]], which losses reaching $950 million (2000 USD). [[Hurricane Gordon (2000)|Hurricane Gordon]] and [[Tropical Storm Helene (2000)|Tropical Storm Helene]] both caused moderate damage in the [[Southeastern United States]], mainly in [[Florida]]. [[Tropical Storm Beryl (2000)|Tropical Storm Beryl]] caused minor damage in Mexico and [[Hurricane Debby (2000)|Hurricane Debby]] resulted in less than $1 million (2000 USD) in damage in the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]]. [[Hurricane Michael (2000)|Hurricane Michael]] brought widespread effects to [[Atlantic Canada]], though a specific damage toll is unknown.\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n===Pre-season outlooks===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; text-align:right;\"\n|+'''Predictions of tropical activity in the 2000 season'''\n|- style=\"background:#ccccff\"\n|align=\"center\"|'''Source'''\n|align=\"center\"|'''Date'''\n|align=\"center\"|'''<small>Tropical<br>storms</small>'''\n|align=\"center\"|'''<small>Hurricanes</small>'''\n|align=\"center\"|'''<small>Major<br>hurricanes</small>'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Colorado State University|CSU]]\n|align=\"left\"|''Average <small>(1950\u20132000)</small>''\n|9.6\n|5.9\n|2.3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]\n|align=\"left\"|''Average''\n|11\n|6\n|2\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|CSU\n|align=\"left\"|April 7, 2000\n|11\n|7\n|3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|CSU\n|align=\"left\"|June 7, 2000\n|12\n|8\n|4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|CSU\n|align=\"left\"|August 4, 2000\n|11\n|7\n|3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|NOAA\n|align=\"left\"|August 10, 2000\n|11\n|7\n|3\n|-\n|align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|'''Actual activity'''\n|'''15'''\n|'''8'''\n|'''3'''\n|}\n\nForecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. [[William M.

storm in a [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] since [[1992 Atlantic hurricane season|1992]]. The hurricane season officially began on June 1, and ended on November 30. It was slightly above average due to a [[La Ni\u00f1a]] weather pattern although most of the storms were weak. The first cyclone, Tropical Depression One, developed in the southern [[Gulf of Mexico]] on June 7 and dissipated after an uneventful duration. However, it would be almost two months before the first named storm, [[Hurricane Alberto (2000)|Alberto]], formed near [[Cape Verde]]; Alberto also dissipated with no effects on land. Several other tropical cyclones\u2014Tropical Depression Two, Tropical Depression Four, Chris, Ernesto, Nadine, and an unnamed subtropical storm\u2014did not impact land. Five additional storms\u2014Tropical Depression Nine, [[Hurricane Florence (2000)|Florence]], [[Hurricane Isaac (2000)|Isaac]], [[Hurricane Joyce (2000)|Joyce]], and [[Tropical Storm Leslie (2000)|Leslie]]\u2014minimally affected land areas.\n\nThe most significant storm of the season was [[Hurricane Keith]], which caused extensive damage in [[Central America]]. After remaining nearly stationary offshore, Keith moved inland over the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] and later made a second landfall in Mexico at hurricane intensity. It caused $319 million (2000 USD) in damage and 40 fatalities, mostly in [[Belize]]. The precursor to Tropical Storm Leslie brought severe flooding to [[South Florida]], which losses reaching $950 million (2000 USD). [[Hurricane Gordon (2000)|Hurricane Gordon]] and [[Tropical Storm Helene (2000)|Tropical Storm Helene]] both caused moderate damage in the [[Southeastern United States]], mainly in [[Florida]]. [[Tropical Storm Beryl (2000)|Tropical Storm Beryl]] caused minor damage in Mexico and [[Hurricane Debby (2000)|Hurricane Debby]] resulted in less than $1 million (2000 USD) in damage in the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]]. [[Hurricane Michael (2000)|Hurricane Michael]] brought widespread effects to [[Atlantic Canada]], though a specific damage toll is unknown.\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n===Pre-season outlooks===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; text-align:right;\"\n|+'''Predictions of tropical activity in the 2000 season'''\n|- style=\"background:#ccccff\"\n|align=\"center\"|'''Source'''\n|align=\"center\"|'''Date'''\n|align=\"center\"|'''<small>Tropical<br>storms</small>'''\n|align=\"center\"|'''<small>Hurricanes</small>'''\n|align=\"center\"|'''<small>Major<br>hurricanes</small>'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Colorado State University|CSU]]\n|align=\"left\"|''Average <small>(1950\u20132000)</small>''\n|9.6\n|5.9\n|2.3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]\n|align=\"left\"|''Average''\n|11\n|6\n|2\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|CSU\n|align=\"left\"|April 7, 2000\n|11\n|7\n|3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|CSU\n|align=\"left\"|June 7, 2000\n|12\n|8\n|4\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|CSU\n|align=\"left\"|August 4, 2000\n|11\n|7\n|3\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|NOAA\n|align=\"left\"|August 10, 2000\n|11\n|7\n|3\n|-\n|align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|'''Actual activity'''\n|'''15'''\n|'''8'''\n|'''3'''\n|}\n\nForecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert Dr. [[William M.

The purpose of a clutch is in part to allow such control; in particular, a clutch provides transfer of torque between shafts spinning at different speeds. In the extreme, clutch control is used in performance driving, such as starting from a dead stop with the engine producing maximum torque at high RPM.\n\n==Overview==\nWith the clutch pedal completely pressed or a motorcycle's  lever pulled entirely towards the driver, there is no direct link between the engine and the [[driveshaft]], so no power can pass from the engine to the driveshaft and wheels. With the pedal entirely released, there is full contact between the engine and the driveshaft, via the clutch plate, which means that the engine can apply power directly to the driveshaft. However, it is possible to have the clutch plate partially engaged, allowing the clutch to slip. As a result, only a fraction of the power from the engine reaches the driveshaft, which is commonly known as half clutch.\n\n==Benefits==\n\nThere are benefits to the use of clutch control in specific circumstances:\n\n===Low gear and low speed===\n\nWhen a car is in first gear, small variations in [[Revolutions per minute|engine speed]] translate to large changes in acceleration and engine braking.  However, with a combination of clutch control and careful use of engine speed, a much smoother ride can be achieved by allowing the clutch to slip. Variations in engine revs are not immediately translated into changes in drive shaft rotation speed, but rather the friction on the clutch plate allows the drive shaft to gradually equalize with the speed of the engine.\n\nAt a certain point while gently lifting the clutch, the car will begin to move as the clutch starts to slip, referred to as the biting point.<ref>{{Citation |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cHLobI8YgfcC&pg=PA68 |title=Driving: The Essential Skills |author= [[Driving Standards Agency]] |publisher=[[The Stationery Office]] |year=  2005 |ISBN= 9780115526411  }}</ref> Here, the accelerator pedal should be gently depressed to slowly increase the car's speed. Once the car reaches a suitable speed, the clutch can be fully engaged and speed can then be controlled either by varying the engine speed or by partially disengaging the clutch again if necessary.\n\nThis particular use of clutch control is frequently taught to learning drivers as a way to control acceleration when pulling away from a complete stop or when driving at very slow speeds while minimizing the chance of [[Stall_(engine)|stalling]] the engine.\n\n===Uphill start===\n:''For mechanical aids to hill-starting, see [[Hill-holder]] and [[Hill Start Assist]]''\nWhen pulling away on an uphill slope, the chance of stalling the engine is greater, and so it can be beneficial to engage the clutch more slowly than normal while revving higher than normal.\n\n===Adverse road conditions===\n\nIn adverse road conditions, notably snow or ice, it is recommended to pull away in as low a gear as possible to minimize torque{{clarify |date=November 2019 |reason=low gear is high torque; a higher gear would given you less torque at the wheels}} on the wheels and thereby maintain traction with the road. Pulling away requires progressively slower engagement of the clutch as the gear increases, and in a high gear it is necessary to engage the clutch slowly to avoid the increased risk of stalling the engine, or, in the case of adverse weather conditions, spinning the wheels.\n\n===Balancing the clutch===\n\nNormally, when a vehicle is stationary on an uphill slope it is necessary to use the handbrake in conjunction with clutch control to prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards when pulling away.  However, in situations where the vehicle must be stopped briefly, for example in slow moving traffic, the clutch can be used to balance the uphill force from the engine with the downhill force of gravity.  The benefit of this is that there is no need for the hand- or foot-brake, and the driver can pull away more quickly, and sometimes even the accelerator is used with the partially engaged clutch as the clutch alone cannot 'handle' such a steep incline and instead the engine would just stall. Using this option will wear out the clutch more quickly however in some steep inclines with stop-start moving traffic, it is the easiest option as using the handbrake would be time-consuming.\n\n===Deceleration===\nTypically with motorcycles and in motor sport, the clutch is often used to facilitate the use of resistance from the engine spinning at high speeds to decelerate the vehicle more quickly, often accompanied with normal braking. This can be achieved by placing the vehicle in a gear that would ordinarily be too low for the current speed and momentum of the vehicle and by partly engaging the clutch. When this happens, momentum energy from the inertia of the vehicle is taken away to spin the engine as close as possible to its maximum capability. As the vehicle is decelerating, the clutch can be further released to transfer more energy to keep the engine spinning as quickly as possible. This method causes excessive clutch wear, however, and it could cause severe engine damage or wheel lockup if the clutch were to be released suddenly.\n\nA better method is to downshift to a lower gear that would spin the engine within its RPM limit and use the throttle to \"rev match\" the engine to the road speed before releasing the clutch fully. Effective engine braking is still achieved with little or no excessive clutch wear.\n\nOnce the clutch is entirely released and the vehicle has decelerated some, this cycle proceeds downwards through the gears to further assist deceleration. If the clutch is controlled improperly while this is being attempted, damage or extra wear to the engine and gears is possible, as well as the risk of wheels locking up and a subsequent loss of proper vehicle control.\n\n{{See also|Engine braking}}\n\n==Problems==\n\nEven normal use of clutch control increases the wear (and decreases the lifespan) of the clutch. Excessive use of clutch control or \"riding the clutch\" will cause further damage.\n\n===Prolonged use===\n\nWhile the use of clutch control at low speed can be used to obtain greater control of acceleration and engine braking, once a car has picked up sufficient speed the clutch should be fully engaged (pedal released).\n\n===Excessive engine revolutions===\n\nExcessively revving the engine while using clutch control, or keeping the clutch partially engaged while accelerating with the gas pedal, can cause unnecessary damage to the clutch.\n\n==Slipping the clutch==\n\n'''Slipping the clutch''' (sometimes referred to as '''feathering the clutch''') is a term used by automotive enthusiasts to describe when the driver alternately applies and releases the clutch to achieve some movement of the car. It's called ''slipping'' because the clutch plate will slip against the [[flywheel]] surface when such an action is performed. Slipping the clutch is known to be hard on the clutch surface due to the sliding [[friction]] created.\n\nDrivers can frequently be observed slipping the clutch when they are trying to stay stationary on a hill without using [[Transmission (mechanics)|neutral]] and the [[brake]]. They apply the clutch to climb a bit, then release to roll back, then apply again, etc. so that the car stays in about the same place. With enough practice, alternating is no longer needed. Applying the correct amount of clutch pressure and throttle causes just enough force from the engine to counter gravity and keep the vehicle stationary (See [[#Balancing the clutch|Balancing the clutch]]). The alternative to this technique of staying stationary on a hill would be to put the vehicle in neutral and apply the brake.\n\nSlipping the clutch is a popular term in [[drag racing]] culture and is done when launching a car, usually in a drag race. Some contend that slipping the clutch is the best way to launch a [[front-wheel drive]] (FWD) car as it prevents [[Torque steering]] that many FWD cars experience when too much power is put to the front wheels.\n\n==Riding the clutch==\n\nIn a vehicle with a [[manual transmission]], '''riding the clutch''' refers to the practice of needlessly keeping the clutch partially disengaged. This results in the clutch being unable to fully engage with the flywheel and so causes premature wear on the disc and flywheel.\n\nA common example of riding the clutch is to keep slight continual pressure on the clutch pedal whilst driving, as when a driver habitually rests his/her foot on the clutch pedal instead of on the floorboard or [[dead pedal]].  Although this slight pressure is not enough to allow the clutch disc itself to slip, it is enough to keep the release bearing against the release springs.  This causes the bearing to remain spinning, which leads to premature bearing failure.\n\nWhen shifting properly, the driver \"shifts\" to another gear and then releases pressure on the clutch pedal to re-engage the engine to the [[driveshaft]].  If the pedal is released quickly, a definite lurch can be felt as the engine and driveshaft re-engage and their speeds equalize.  However, if the clutch is released slowly the clutch disc will \"slip\" against the flywheel; this friction permits the engine a smoother transition to its new rotation speed.  Such routine slippage causes wear on the clutch analogous to the wear-and-tear on a [[brake pad]] when stopping.  Some amount of wear is unavoidable, but with better clutching/shifting technique it can be minimized by releasing the clutch as close to the correct engine speed for the gear and vehicle speed as possible.  When upshifting, this will involve allowing the engine speed to fall.  Conversely, when downshifting, increasing the engine speed with the accelerator prior to releasing clutch will result in a smoother transition and minimal clutch wear.\n\nRiding the clutch occurs when the driver does not fully release the clutch pedal.  This results in the clutch disc slipping against the flywheel and some engine power not being transferred to the drive train and wheels.  While inefficient, most drivers routinely use this technique effectively when driving in reverse (as fully engaging the reverse gear results in velocity too great for the short distance traveled) or in stop-and-go traffic (as it is easier to control the [[throttle]] and [[acceleration]] at very slow speeds).\n\nRiding the clutch should not be confused with \"freewheeling\" or \"coasting\", where the clutch is pressed down fully allowing the car to roll either downhill or from inertia.  While this is not damaging to the car, it can be considered a dangerous way to drive since one forgoes the ability to quickly accelerate if needed.  It is, however, a common practice to roll into a parking space or over [[speed bumps]] via inertia.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Double clutch (technique)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Driving techniques]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2017}}\n{{Howto|date=September 2014}}\n'''Clutch control''' refers to the act of controlling the speed of a vehicle with a [[manual transmission]] by partially engaging the [[clutch]] plate, using the [[clutch pedal]] instead of (or in conjunction with) the accelerator pedal.

Excessive use of clutch control or \"riding the clutch\" will cause further damage.\n\n===Prolonged use===\n\nWhile the use of clutch control at low speed can be used to obtain greater control of acceleration and engine braking, once a car has picked up sufficient speed the clutch should be fully engaged (pedal released).\n\n===Excessive engine revolutions===\n\nExcessively revving the engine while using clutch control, or keeping the clutch partially engaged while accelerating with the gas pedal, can cause unnecessary damage to the clutch.\n\n==Slipping the clutch==\n\n'''Slipping the clutch''' (sometimes referred to as '''feathering the clutch''') is a term used by automotive enthusiasts to describe when the driver alternately applies and releases the clutch to achieve some movement of the car. It's called ''slipping'' because the clutch plate will slip against the [[flywheel]] surface when such an action is performed. Slipping the clutch is known to be hard on the clutch surface due to the sliding [[friction]] created.\n\nDrivers can frequently be observed slipping the clutch when they are trying to stay stationary on a hill without using [[Transmission (mechanics)|neutral]] and the [[brake]]. They apply the clutch to climb a bit, then release to roll back, then apply again, etc. so that the car stays in about the same place. With enough practice, alternating is no longer needed. Applying the correct amount of clutch pressure and throttle causes just enough force from the engine to counter gravity and keep the vehicle stationary (See [[#Balancing the clutch|Balancing the clutch]]). The alternative to this technique of staying stationary on a hill would be to put the vehicle in neutral and apply the brake.\n\nSlipping the clutch is a popular term in [[drag racing]] culture and is done when launching a car, usually in a drag race. Some contend that slipping the clutch is the best way to launch a [[front-wheel drive]] (FWD) car as it prevents [[Torque steering]] that many FWD cars experience when too much power is put to the front wheels.\n\n==Riding the clutch==\n\nIn a vehicle with a [[manual transmission]], '''riding the clutch''' refers to the practice of needlessly keeping the clutch partially disengaged. This results in the clutch being unable to fully engage with the flywheel and so causes premature wear on the disc and flywheel.\n\nA common example of riding the clutch is to keep slight continual pressure on the clutch pedal whilst driving, as when a driver habitually rests his/her foot on the clutch pedal instead of on the floorboard or [[dead pedal]].  Although this slight pressure is not enough to allow the clutch disc itself to slip, it is enough to keep the release bearing against the release springs.  This causes the bearing to remain spinning, which leads to premature bearing failure.\n\nWhen shifting properly, the driver \"shifts\" to another gear and then releases pressure on the clutch pedal to re-engage the engine to the [[driveshaft]].  If the pedal is released quickly, a definite lurch can be felt as the engine and driveshaft re-engage and their speeds equalize.  However, if the clutch is released slowly the clutch disc will \"slip\" against the flywheel; this friction permits the engine a smoother transition to its new rotation speed.  Such routine slippage causes wear on the clutch analogous to the wear-and-tear on a [[brake pad]] when stopping.  Some amount of wear is unavoidable, but with better clutching/shifting technique it can be minimized by releasing the clutch as close to the correct engine speed for the gear and vehicle speed as possible.  When upshifting, this will involve allowing the engine speed to fall.  Conversely, when downshifting, increasing the engine speed with the accelerator prior to releasing clutch will result in a smoother transition and minimal clutch wear.\n\nRiding the clutch occurs when the driver does not fully release the clutch pedal.  This results in the clutch disc slipping against the flywheel and some engine power not being transferred to the drive train and wheels.  While inefficient, most drivers routinely use this technique effectively when driving in reverse (as fully engaging the reverse gear results in velocity too great for the short distance traveled) or in stop-and-go traffic (as it is easier to control the [[throttle]] and [[acceleration]] at very slow speeds).\n\nRiding the clutch should not be confused with \"freewheeling\" or \"coasting\", where the clutch is pressed down fully allowing the car to roll either downhill or from inertia.  While this is not damaging to the car, it can be considered a dangerous way to drive since one forgoes the ability to quickly accelerate if needed.  It is, however, a common practice to roll into a parking space or over [[speed bumps]] via inertia.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Double clutch (technique)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Driving techniques]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBalancing the clutch:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: time consuming \u2192 time-consuming", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_control"}

Lymphedema is most frequently a complication of cancer treatment or [[parasitic infection]]s, but it can also be seen in a number of [[genetic disorder]]s. Though incurable and progressive, a number of treatments can improve symptoms. Tissues with lymphedema are at high risk of [[infection]] because the lymphatic system has been compromised.<ref name=Stat2020>{{cite journal |last1=Sleigh |first1=BC |last2=Manna |first2=B |title=Lymphedema |date=January 2020 |pmid=30725924}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Treatment -->\nWhile there is no cure, treatment may improve outcomes.<ref name=Grad2017/> This commonly include compression therapy, good skin care, exercise, and [[manual lymphatic drainage]] (MLD), which together is known as combined decongestive therapy.<ref name=Grad2017/> [[Diuretics]] are not useful.<ref name=Grad2017 /> Surgery is generally only used in those who are not improved with other measures.<ref name=Grad2017/>\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n[[File:Dr. Ming-Huei Cheng's lymphedema Sample.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Lymphedema in the CT scan]]\n\nThe most common manifestation of lymphedema is soft tissue swelling, [[edema]]. As the disorder progresses, worsening edema and skin changes including discoloration, verrucous (wart-like) [[hyperplasia]], [[hyperkeratosis]], [[papillomatosis]], dermal thickening and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcers]] may be seen. Additionally, there is increased risk of infection of the skin, known as [[cellulitis]].\n\n===Complications===\nWhen the lymphatic impairment becomes so great that the lymph fluid exceeds the lymphatic system's ability to transport it, an abnormal amount of protein-rich fluid collects in the tissues. Left untreated, this stagnant, protein-rich fluid causes tissue channels to increase in size and number, reducing oxygen availability.

In many patients with [[cancer]], this condition does not develop until months or even years after therapy has concluded. Lymphedema may also be associated with [[accident]]s or certain diseases or problems that may inhibit the lymphatic system from functioning properly.<ref name=\":1\" /> In tropical areas of the world, a common cause of secondary lymphedema is [[filariasis]], a parasitic infection. It can also be caused by damage to the lymphatic system from infections such as [[cellulitis]].\n\nPrimary lymphedema may be congenital or arise sporadically. Multiple syndromes are associated with primary lymphedema, including [[Turner syndrome]], [[Milroy's disease]], and [[Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome]]. It is generally thought to occur as a result of absent or malformed lymph nodes and/or lymphatic channels. Lymphedema may be present at birth, develop at the onset of puberty (praecox), or not become apparent for many years into adulthood (tarda). In men, lower-limb primary lymphedema is most common, occurring in one or both legs. Some cases of lymphedema may be associated with other vascular abnormalities.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSecondary lymphedema affects both men and women.

It may also occur in the lower limbs or groin after surgery for colon, ovarian or uterine cancer, in which removal of lymph nodes or radiation therapy is required. Surgery or treatment for prostate, colon and testicular cancers may result in secondary lymphedema, particularly when lymph nodes have been removed or damaged.\n\nThe onset of secondary lymphedema in patients who have had cancer surgery has also been linked to aircraft flight (likely due to decreased cabin pressure or relative immobility). For cancer survivors, therefore, wearing a prescribed and properly fitted compression garment may help decrease swelling during air travel.\n\nSome cases of lower-limb lymphedema have been associated with the use of [[tamoxifen]], due to the blood clots and [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) that can be associated with this medication. Resolution of the blood clots or DVT is needed before lymphedema treatment can be initiated.\n\nInfectious causes include [[lymphatic filariasis]].\n\n===At birth===\n[[Congenital]] lymphedema is swelling that results from abnormalities in the [[lymphatic system]] that are present from birth. Swelling may be present in a single affected limb, several limbs, genitalia, or the face. It is sometimes diagnosed prenatally by a [[nuchal scan]] or post-natally by lymphoscintigraphy.

This deficiency is a grouping of several disorders caused by common defect, viz., familial or sporadic [[Mutation#By effect on function|inactivating mutation]]s in one of the two parental ''[[GATA2]]'' [[gene]]s. These [[autosomal dominant]] mutations cause a reduction, i.e. a [[haploinsufficiency]], in the cellular levels of the gene's product, [[GATA2]]. The GATA2 [[protein]] is a [[transcription factor]] critical for the [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]], maintenance, and functionality of [[blood|blood-forming]], [[Lymphatic system|lympathic-forming]], and other tissue-forming [[stem cell]]s. In consequence of these mutations, cellular levels of GATA2 are deficient and individuals develop over time hematological, immunological, lymphatic, and/or other disorders. GATA2 deficiency-induced defects in the lymphatic vessels and valves underlies the development of lymphedema which is primarily located in the lower extremities but may also occur in other places such as the face or testes (i.e. [[hydrocele]]). This form of the deficiency, when coupled with [[sensorineural hearing loss]] which may also be due to faulty development of the lymphatic system, is sometimes termed the [[Emberger syndrome]].<ref name=\"pmid28179280\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Crispino JD, Horwitz MS | title = GATA factor mutations in hematologic disease | journal = Blood | volume = 129 | issue = 15 | pages = 2103\u20132110 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28179280 | pmc = 5391620 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2016-09-687889 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid28643018\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirabayashi S, Wlodarski MW, Kozyra E, Niemeyer CM | title = Heterogeneity of GATA2-related myeloid neoplasms | journal = International Journal of Hematology | volume = 106 | issue = 2 | pages = 175\u2013182 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28643018 | doi = 10.1007/s12185-017-2285-2 }}</ref>\n\nPrimary lymphedema has a quoted incidence of approximately 1-3 births out of every 10,000 births, with a particular female preponderance to male ratio of 3.5:1 In North America, the incidence of primary lymphedema is approximately 1.15 births out of every 100,000 births Compared to secondary lymphedema, primary lymphedema is relatively rare.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurland LT, Molgaard CA | title = The patient record in epidemiology | journal = Scientific American | volume = 245 | issue = 4 | pages = 54\u201363 | date = October 1981 | pmid = 7027437 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1081-54 | bibcode = 1981SciAm.245d..54K }}</ref>\n\n==Physiology==\n[[Lymph]] is formed from the fluid that filters out of the blood circulation and contains proteins, cellular debris, bacteria, etc. The collection of this  fluid is carried out by the initial lymph collectors that are blind-ended [[Epithelium|epithelial]]-lined vessels with fenestrated openings that allow fluids and particles as large as cells to enter. Once inside the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the lymphatic vessels, the fluid is guided along increasingly larger vessels, first with rudimentary valves to prevent backflow, which later develop into complete valves similar to the venous valve. Once the lymph enters the fully valved lymphatic vessels, it is pumped by a rhythmic peristaltic-like action by smooth muscle cells within the lymphatic vessel walls. This peristaltic action is the primary driving force, moving lymph within its vessel walls. The regulation of the frequency and power of contraction is regulated by the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Lymph movement can be influenced by the pressure of nearby muscle contraction, arterial pulse pressure and the vacuum created in the chest cavity during respiration, but these passive forces contribute only a minor percentage of lymph transport. The fluids collected are pumped into continually larger vessels and through lymph nodes, which remove debris and police the fluid for dangerous microbes. The lymph ends its journey in the thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct, which drain into the blood circulation.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis is generally based on signs and symptoms, with testing used to rule out other potential causes.<ref name=Grad2017/> An accurate diagnosis and staging may help with management.<ref name=Grad2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grada AA, Phillips TJ | title = Lymphedema: Diagnostic workup and management | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 77 | issue = 6 | pages = 995\u20131006 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29132859 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2017.03.021 }}</ref> A swollen limb can result from different conditions that require different treatments.

The first signs may be subjective observations such as a feeling of heaviness in the affected extremity.

With the assistance of medical imaging apparatus, such as [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] or [[CT scan|CT]], staging can be established by the physician, and therapeutic or medical interventions may be applied:\n* '''Stage 0''': The lymphatic vessels have sustained some damage that is not yet apparent. Transport capacity is sufficient for the amount of lymph being removed. Lymphedema is not present.\n* '''Stage 1''' : Swelling increases during the day and disappears overnight as the patient lies flat in bed. Tissue is still at the pitting stage: when pressed by the fingertips, the affected area indents and reverses with elevation. Usually upon waking in the morning, the limb or affected area is normal or almost normal in size. Treatment is not necessarily required at this point. \n* '''Stage 2''': Swelling is not reversible overnight, and does not disappear without proper management. The tissue now has a spongy consistency and is considered non-pitting: when pressed by the fingertips, the affected area bounces back without indentation. [[Fibrosis]] found in Stage 2 lymphedema marks the beginning of the hardening of the limbs and increasing size.\n* '''Stage 3''': Swelling is irreversible and usually the limb(s) or affected area become increasingly large. The tissue is hard (fibrotic) and unresponsive; some patients consider undergoing reconstructive surgery, called \"debulking\". This remains controversial, however, since the risks may outweigh the benefits and the further damage done to the lymphatic system may in fact make the lymphedema worse.\n* '''Stage 4''': The size and circumference of the affected limb(s) become noticeably large. Bumps, lumps, or protusions (also called knobs) on the skin begin to appear.\n* '''Stage 5''': The affected limb(s) become grossly large; one or more deep skin folds is prevalent among patients in this stage.\n* '''Stage 6''': Knobs of small elongated or small rounded sizes cluster together, giving mossy-like shapes on the limb. Mobility of the patient becomes increasingly difficult.\n* '''Stage 7''': The person becomes handicapped, and is unable to independently perform daily routine activities such as walking, bathing and cooking. Assistance from the family and health care system is needed.\n\n====Grades====\nLymphedema can also be categorized by its severity (usually referenced to a healthy extremity):<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee TS, Morris CM, Czerniec SA, Mangion AJ | title = Does Lymphedema Severity Affect Quality of Life?

The difference in circumference is less than 4&nbsp;cm and other tissue changes are not yet present.\n* '''Grade 2''' (moderate edema): Involves an entire limb or corresponding quadrant of the trunk. Difference in circumference is 4\u20136&nbsp;cm. Tissue changes, such as pitting, are apparent. The patient may experience [[erysipelas]].\n* '''Grade 3a''' (severe edema): Lymphedema is present in one limb and its associated trunk quadrant. Circumferential difference is greater than 6 centimeters. Significant skin alterations, such as [[cornification]] or [[keratosis]], [[cysts]] and/or [[fistulae]], are present. Additionally, the patient may experience repeated attacks of [[erysipelas]].\n* '''Grade 3b''' (massive edema): The same symptoms as grade 3a, except that two or more extremities are affected.\n* '''Grade 4''' (gigantic edema): In this stage of lymphedema, the affected extremities are huge, due to almost complete blockage of the lymph channels.\n\n===Differential===\nLymphedema should not be confused with edema arising from [[Chronic venous insufficiency|venous insufficiency]], which is caused by compromise of the venous drainage rather than lymphatic drainage. However, untreated venous insufficiency can progress into a combined venous/lymphatic disorder.\n\n==Treatment==\nWhile there is no cure, treatment may improve outcomes.<ref name=Grad2017/> This commonly include compression therapy, good skin care, exercise, and [[manual lymphatic drainage]] (MLD), which together is known as combined decongestive therapy.<ref name=Grad2017/> MLD is most effective in mild to moderate disease.<ref name=Ez2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ezzo J, Manheimer E, McNeely ML, Howell DM, Weiss R, Johansson KI, Bao T, Bily L, Tuppo CM, Williams AF, Karadibak D | display-authors = 6 | title = Manual lymphatic drainage for lymphedema following breast cancer treatment | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 5 | pages = CD003475 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25994425 | pmc = 4966288 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003475.pub2 }}</ref> In breast cancer-related lymphedema, MLD is safe and may offer added benefit to compression bandages for reducing swelling.<ref name=Ez2015/> Most people with lymphedema can be medically managed with conservative treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Koul R, Dufan T, Russell C, Guenther W, Nugent Z, Sun X, Cooke AL | title = Efficacy of complete decongestive therapy and manual lymphatic drainage on treatment-related lymphedema in breast cancer | journal = International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 841\u20136 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17175115 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.09.024 }}</ref> Diuretics are not useful.<ref name=Grad2017 /> Surgery is generally only used in those who are not improved with other measures.<ref name=Grad2017/>\n\n===Compression===\n\n====Garments====\n[[File:Lymphedema Compression sleeve November 2106 Second Skin 016.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lymphedema compression sleeve on mannequin]]\n\nOnce a person is diagnosed with lymphedema, compression becomes imperative in the management of the condition. Garments are often intended to be worn all day, but may be taken off for sleeping unless otherwise prescribed. [[Compression stockings|Elastic compression garments]] are worn on the affected limb following complete decongestive therapy to maintain edema reduction. Inelastic garments provide containment and reduction.<ref name=Grad2017 /> Available styles, options, and prices vary widely. A professional garment fitter or certified lymphedema therapist can help determine the best option for the patient. \n\n====Bandaging====\nCompression bandaging, also called wrapping, is the application of layers of padding and short-stretch bandages to the involved areas. Short-stretch bandages are preferred over long-stretch bandages (such as those normally used to treat sprains), as the long-stretch bandages cannot produce the proper therapeutic tension necessary to safely reduce lymphedema and may in fact end up producing a tourniquet effect. During activity, whether exercise or daily activities, the short-stretch bandages enhance the pumping action of the lymph vessels by providing increased resistance. This encourages lymphatic flow and helps to soften fluid-swollen areas.\n\n====Intermittent pneumatic compression therapy====\n[[Intermittent pneumatic compression]] therapy (IPC) utilizes a multi-chambered pneumatic sleeve with overlapping cells to promote movement of lymph fluid.<ref name=Grad2017 /> Pump therapy should be used in addition to other treatments such as compression bandaging and manual lymph drainage. Pump therapy has been used a lot in the past to help with controlling lymphedema.

Lymphedema is most frequently a complication of cancer treatment or [[parasitic infection]]s, but it can also be seen in a number of [[genetic disorder]]s. Though incurable and progressive, a number of treatments can improve symptoms.

As the disorder progresses, worsening edema and skin changes including discoloration, verrucous (wart-like) [[hyperplasia]], [[hyperkeratosis]], [[papillomatosis]], dermal thickening and [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcers]] may be seen. Additionally, there is increased risk of infection of the skin, known as [[cellulitis]].\n\n===Complications===\nWhen the lymphatic impairment becomes so great that the lymph fluid exceeds the lymphatic system's ability to transport it, an abnormal amount of protein-rich fluid collects in the tissues. Left untreated, this stagnant, protein-rich fluid causes tissue channels to increase in size and number, reducing oxygen availability. This interferes with wound healing and provides a rich culture medium for bacterial growth that can result in [[infections]], [[cellulitis]], [[lymphangitis]], [[lymphadenitis]] and, in severe cases, [[Ulcer (dermatology)|skin ulcers]].<ref name=\":1\" /> It is vital for lymphedema patients to be aware of the symptoms of infection and to seek immediate treatment, since recurrent infections or cellulitis, in addition to their inherent danger, further damage the lymphatic system and set up a vicious circle.\n\nIn rare cases, lymphedema can lead to a form of cancer called [[lymphangiosarcoma]], although the mechanism of carcinogenesis is not understood. Lymphedema-associated lymphangiosarcoma is called [[Stewart-Treves syndrome]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Lymphangiosarcoma most frequently occurs in cases of long-standing lymphedema.

Multiple syndromes are associated with primary lymphedema, including [[Turner syndrome]], [[Milroy's disease]], and [[Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome]]. It is generally thought to occur as a result of absent or malformed lymph nodes and/or lymphatic channels. Lymphedema may be present at birth, develop at the onset of puberty (praecox), or not become apparent for many years into adulthood (tarda).

It may also occur in the lower limbs or groin after surgery for colon, ovarian or uterine cancer, in which removal of lymph nodes or radiation therapy is required. Surgery or treatment for prostate, colon and testicular cancers may result in secondary lymphedema, particularly when lymph nodes have been removed or damaged.\n\nThe onset of secondary lymphedema in patients who have had cancer surgery has also been linked to aircraft flight (likely due to decreased cabin pressure or relative immobility). For cancer survivors, therefore, wearing a prescribed and properly fitted compression garment may help decrease swelling during air travel.\n\nSome cases of lower-limb lymphedema have been associated with the use of [[tamoxifen]], due to the blood clots and [[deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) that can be associated with this medication. Resolution of the blood clots or DVT is needed before lymphedema treatment can be initiated.\n\nInfectious causes include [[lymphatic filariasis]].\n\n===At birth===\n[[Congenital]] lymphedema is swelling that results from abnormalities in the [[lymphatic system]] that are present from birth. Swelling may be present in a single affected limb, several limbs, genitalia, or the face. It is sometimes diagnosed prenatally by a [[nuchal scan]] or post-natally by lymphoscintigraphy.

This deficiency is a grouping of several disorders caused by common defect, viz., familial or sporadic [[Mutation#By effect on function|inactivating mutation]]s in one of the two parental ''[[GATA2]]'' [[gene]]s. These [[autosomal dominant]] mutations cause a reduction, i.e. a [[haploinsufficiency]], in the cellular levels of the gene's product, [[GATA2]]. The GATA2 [[protein]] is a [[transcription factor]] critical for the [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]], maintenance, and functionality of [[blood|blood-forming]], [[Lymphatic system|lympathic-forming]], and other tissue-forming [[stem cell]]s. In consequence of these mutations, cellular levels of GATA2 are deficient and individuals develop over time hematological, immunological, lymphatic, and/or other disorders. GATA2 deficiency-induced defects in the lymphatic vessels and valves underlies the development of lymphedema which is primarily located in the lower extremities but may also occur in other places such as the face or testes (i.e. [[hydrocele]]). This form of the deficiency, when coupled with [[sensorineural hearing loss]] which may also be due to faulty development of the lymphatic system, is sometimes termed the [[Emberger syndrome]].<ref name=\"pmid28179280\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Crispino JD, Horwitz MS | title = GATA factor mutations in hematologic disease | journal = Blood | volume = 129 | issue = 15 | pages = 2103\u20132110 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28179280 | pmc = 5391620 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2016-09-687889 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid28643018\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirabayashi S, Wlodarski MW, Kozyra E, Niemeyer CM | title = Heterogeneity of GATA2-related myeloid neoplasms | journal = International Journal of Hematology | volume = 106 | issue = 2 | pages = 175\u2013182 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28643018 | doi = 10.1007/s12185-017-2285-2 }}</ref>\n\nPrimary lymphedema has a quoted incidence of approximately 1-3 births out of every 10,000 births, with a particular female preponderance to male ratio of 3.5:1 In North America, the incidence of primary lymphedema is approximately 1.15 births out of every 100,000 births Compared to secondary lymphedema, primary lymphedema is relatively rare.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kurland LT, Molgaard CA | title = The patient record in epidemiology | journal = Scientific American | volume = 245 | issue = 4 | pages = 54\u201363 | date = October 1981 | pmid = 7027437 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1081-54 | bibcode = 1981SciAm.245d..54K }}</ref>\n\n==Physiology==\n[[Lymph]] is formed from the fluid that filters out of the blood circulation and contains proteins, cellular debris, bacteria, etc. The collection of this  fluid is carried out by the initial lymph collectors that are blind-ended [[Epithelium|epithelial]]-lined vessels with fenestrated openings that allow fluids and particles as large as cells to enter. Once inside the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the lymphatic vessels, the fluid is guided along increasingly larger vessels, first with rudimentary valves to prevent backflow, which later develop into complete valves similar to the venous valve. Once the lymph enters the fully valved lymphatic vessels, it is pumped by a rhythmic peristaltic-like action by smooth muscle cells within the lymphatic vessel walls. This peristaltic action is the primary driving force, moving lymph within its vessel walls. The regulation of the frequency and power of contraction is regulated by the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. Lymph movement can be influenced by the pressure of nearby muscle contraction, arterial pulse pressure and the vacuum created in the chest cavity during respiration, but these passive forces contribute only a minor percentage of lymph transport. The fluids collected are pumped into continually larger vessels and through lymph nodes, which remove debris and police the fluid for dangerous microbes. The lymph ends its journey in the thoracic duct or right lymphatic duct, which drain into the blood circulation.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis is generally based on signs and symptoms, with testing used to rule out other potential causes.<ref name=Grad2017/> An accurate diagnosis and staging may help with management.<ref name=Grad2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grada AA, Phillips TJ | title = Lymphedema: Diagnostic workup and management | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 77 | issue = 6 | pages = 995\u20131006 | date = December 2017 | pmid = 29132859 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2017.03.021 }}</ref> A swollen limb can result from different conditions that require different treatments.

Enlargement of the nodes lasting more than three weeks may indicate infection or other illnesses such as sequela from breast cancer surgery requiring further medical attention.<ref name=\"Jarvis2004\"/>\n\nDiagnosis or early detection of lymphedema is difficult. The first signs may be subjective observations such as a feeling of heaviness in the affected extremity. These may be symptomatic of early stage of lymphedema where accumulation of lymph is mild and not detectable by changes in volume or circumference. As lymphedema progresses, definitive diagnosis is commonly based upon an objective measurement of differences between the affected or at-risk limb at the opposite unaffected limb, e.g. in volume or circumference. No generally accepted criterion is definitively diagnostic, although a volume difference of 200&nbsp;ml between limbs or a 4-cm difference (at a single measurement site or set intervals along the limb) is often used.

With the assistance of medical imaging apparatus, such as [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] or [[CT scan|CT]], staging can be established by the physician, and therapeutic or medical interventions may be applied:\n* '''Stage 0''': The lymphatic vessels have sustained some damage that is not yet apparent. Transport capacity is sufficient for the amount of lymph being removed. Lymphedema is not present.\n* '''Stage 1''' : Swelling increases during the day and disappears overnight as the patient lies flat in bed. Tissue is still at the pitting stage: when pressed by the fingertips, the affected area indents and reverses with elevation. Usually upon waking in the morning, the limb or affected area is normal or almost normal in size. Treatment is not necessarily required at this point. \n* '''Stage 2''': Swelling is not reversible overnight, and does not disappear without proper management. The tissue now has a spongy consistency and is considered non-pitting: when pressed by the fingertips, the affected area bounces back without indentation. [[Fibrosis]] found in Stage 2 lymphedema marks the beginning of the hardening of the limbs and increasing size.\n* '''Stage 3''': Swelling is irreversible and usually the limb(s) or affected area become increasingly large. The tissue is hard (fibrotic) and unresponsive; some patients consider undergoing reconstructive surgery, called \"debulking\". This remains controversial, however, since the risks may outweigh the benefits and the further damage done to the lymphatic system may in fact make the lymphedema worse.\n* '''Stage 4''': The size and circumference of the affected limb(s) become noticeably large. Bumps, lumps, or protusions (also called knobs) on the skin begin to appear.\n* '''Stage 5''': The affected limb(s) become grossly large; one or more deep skin folds is prevalent among patients in this stage.\n* '''Stage 6''': Knobs of small elongated or small rounded sizes cluster together, giving mossy-like shapes on the limb. Mobility of the patient becomes increasingly difficult.\n* '''Stage 7''': The person becomes handicapped, and is unable to independently perform daily routine activities such as walking, bathing and cooking. Assistance from the family and health care system is needed.\n\n====Grades====\nLymphedema can also be categorized by its severity (usually referenced to a healthy extremity):<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee TS, Morris CM, Czerniec SA, Mangion AJ | title = Does Lymphedema Severity Affect Quality of Life?

The difference in circumference is less than 4&nbsp;cm and other tissue changes are not yet present.\n* '''Grade 2''' (moderate edema): Involves an entire limb or corresponding quadrant of the trunk. Difference in circumference is 4\u20136&nbsp;cm. Tissue changes, such as pitting, are apparent. The patient may experience [[erysipelas]].\n* '''Grade 3a''' (severe edema): Lymphedema is present in one limb and its associated trunk quadrant. Circumferential difference is greater than 6 centimeters. Significant skin alterations, such as [[cornification]] or [[keratosis]], [[cysts]] and/or [[fistulae]], are present. Additionally, the patient may experience repeated attacks of [[erysipelas]].\n* '''Grade 3b''' (massive edema): The same symptoms as grade 3a, except that two or more extremities are affected.\n* '''Grade 4''' (gigantic edema): In this stage of lymphedema, the affected extremities are huge, due to almost complete blockage of the lymph channels.\n\n===Differential===\nLymphedema should not be confused with edema arising from [[Chronic venous insufficiency|venous insufficiency]], which is caused by compromise of the venous drainage rather than lymphatic drainage. However, untreated venous insufficiency can progress into a combined venous/lymphatic disorder.\n\n==Treatment==\nWhile there is no cure, treatment may improve outcomes.<ref name=Grad2017/> This commonly include compression therapy, good skin care, exercise, and [[manual lymphatic drainage]] (MLD), which together is known as combined decongestive therapy.<ref name=Grad2017/> MLD is most effective in mild to moderate disease.<ref name=Ez2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ezzo J, Manheimer E, McNeely ML, Howell DM, Weiss R, Johansson KI, Bao T, Bily L, Tuppo CM, Williams AF, Karadibak D | display-authors = 6 | title = Manual lymphatic drainage for lymphedema following breast cancer treatment | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 5 | pages = CD003475 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25994425 | pmc = 4966288 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003475.pub2 }}</ref> In breast cancer-related lymphedema, MLD is safe and may offer added benefit to compression bandages for reducing swelling.<ref name=Ez2015/> Most people with lymphedema can be medically managed with conservative treatment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Koul R, Dufan T, Russell C, Guenther W, Nugent Z, Sun X, Cooke AL | title = Efficacy of complete decongestive therapy and manual lymphatic drainage on treatment-related lymphedema in breast cancer | journal = International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 841\u20136 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17175115 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.09.024 }}</ref> Diuretics are not useful.<ref name=Grad2017 /> Surgery is generally only used in those who are not improved with other measures.<ref name=Grad2017/>\n\n===Compression===\n\n====Garments====\n[[File:Lymphedema Compression sleeve November 2106 Second Skin 016.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lymphedema compression sleeve on mannequin]]\n\nOnce a person is diagnosed with lymphedema, compression becomes imperative in the management of the condition. Garments are often intended to be worn all day, but may be taken off for sleeping unless otherwise prescribed. [[Compression stockings|Elastic compression garments]] are worn on the affected limb following complete decongestive therapy to maintain edema reduction. Inelastic garments provide containment and reduction.<ref name=Grad2017 /> Available styles, options, and prices vary widely. A professional garment fitter or certified lymphedema therapist can help determine the best option for the patient. \n\n====Bandaging====\nCompression bandaging, also called wrapping, is the application of layers of padding and short-stretch bandages to the involved areas. Short-stretch bandages are preferred over long-stretch bandages (such as those normally used to treat sprains), as the long-stretch bandages cannot produce the proper therapeutic tension necessary to safely reduce lymphedema and may in fact end up producing a tourniquet effect. During activity, whether exercise or daily activities, the short-stretch bandages enhance the pumping action of the lymph vessels by providing increased resistance. This encourages lymphatic flow and helps to soften fluid-swollen areas.\n\n====Intermittent pneumatic compression therapy====\n[[Intermittent pneumatic compression]] therapy (IPC) utilizes a multi-chambered pneumatic sleeve with overlapping cells to promote movement of lymph fluid.<ref name=Grad2017 /> Pump therapy should be used in addition to other treatments such as compression bandaging and manual lymph drainage.

(1973). ''The Galician-Volynian Chronicle''. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. {{OCLC|902306}}</ref> from 1272 to 1349, when it was conquered by King [[Casimir III the Great]] of Poland. From 1434, it was the regional capital of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, after the [[First Partition of Poland]], the city became the capital of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. In 1918, for a short time, it was the capital of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Between the wars, the city was the centre of the [[Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]].\n\nAfter the German-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Lviv became part of the [[Soviet Union]], and in 1944\u201346 there was a [[population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine]]. In 1991, it became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.\n\nAdministratively, Lviv serves as the administrative centre of [[Lviv Oblast]] and has the status of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]].\n\nLviv was the centre of the historical regions of [[Red Ruthenia]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. The historical heart of the city, with its old buildings and cobblestone streets, survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed. The city has many industries and institutions of [[higher education]] such as [[Lviv University]] and [[Lviv Polytechnic]]. Lviv is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]].

In 1358 the city became a seat of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], which initiated spread of [[Latin Church]] onto the Ruthenian lands.\n\nAfter Casimir had died in 1370, he was succeeded as king of Poland by his nephew, King [[Louis I of Hungary]], who in 1372 put Lviv together with the region of [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]] under the administration of his relative [[Vladislaus II of Opole]], Duke of Opole.<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" /> When in 1387 W\u0142adys\u0142aw retreated from the post of its governor, Galicia-Volhynia became occupied by the [[Hungarians]], but soon [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], the youngest daughter of Louis, but also ruler of Poland and wife of King of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]], unified it directly with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]].<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" />\n\n=== Kingdom of Poland ===\n[[File:Lviv High Castle (Engraving).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lviv High Castle]], fragment of engraving by A.

First Catholic Archbishop who resided in Lviv was Jan Rzeszowski.\n\nIn 1434, the Ruthenian domain of the Crown was transformed into the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]]. In 1444, the city was granted the [[staple right]], which resulted in its growing prosperity and wealth, as it became one of major trading centres on the merchant routes between [[Central Europe]] and [[Black Sea]] region. It was also transformed into one of the main fortresses of the kingdom, and was a royal city, like [[Krak\u00f3w]] or [[Gda\u0144sk]]. During the 17th century, Lw\u00f3w was the second largest city of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], with the population of about 30,000.\n\nIn 1572, one of the first publishers of books in what is now Ukraine, [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], a graduate of the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Krak\u00f3w]], settled here for a brief period. The city became a significant centre for [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the establishment of an Orthodox brotherhood, a Greek-Slavonic school and a printer which published the first full versions of the Bible in Church Slavonic in 1580. A [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines|Jesuit Collegium]] was founded in 1608, and on 20 January 1661 King [[John II Casimir]] of Poland issued a decree granting it \"the honour of the academy and the title of the university\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manresa-sj.org/stamps/2_Ukraine.htm|title=Jesuits in Ukraine|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 17th century brought invading armies of [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Hungary|Hungarians]],<ref>Cathal J.

In 1648 an army of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] and Crimean Tatars besieged the town. They captured the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]], murdering its defenders, but the city itself was not sacked due to the fact that the leader of the revolution [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] accepted a ransom of 250,000 ducats, and the Cossacks marched north-west towards [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]]. It was one of two major cities in Poland which was not captured during the so-called [[Deluge (history)|''Deluge'']]: the other one was [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig). At that time, Lw\u00f3w witnessed a historic scene, as here King John II Casimir made his famous [[Lw\u00f3w Oath]]. On 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lw\u00f3w's Cathedral, conducted by the [[papal legate]] [[Pietro Vidoni]], John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary's protection, whom he announced as ''The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries''. He also swore to ''protect the Kingdom's folk from any impositions and unjust bondage''.\n\nTwo years later, John Casimir, in honour of bravery of its residents, declared Lw\u00f3w to be equal to two historic capitals of the Commonwealth, Krak\u00f3w and [[Wilno]]. In the same year, 1658, [[Pope Alexander VII]] declared the city to be [[Semper fidelis]], in recognition of its key role in defending Europe and Roman-Catholicism from Muslim invasion.\n\nIn 1672 it was surrounded by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] who also failed to conquer it. Three years later, the [[Battle of Lw\u00f3w (1675)]] took place near the city. Lw\u00f3w was captured for the first time since the [[Middle Ages]] by a foreign army in 1704 when Swedish troops under King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] entered the city after a short siege. The [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] of the early 18th century caused the death of about 10,000 inhabitants (40% of the city's population).<ref>Karl-Erik Frandsen.

In 1784, a [[latin language]] university was opened with lectures in German, Polish and even Ruthenian; after closing again in 1805, it was reopened in 1817. By 1825 German became the sole language of instruction.<ref name=\"multi\" />\n[[File:Lwow Panorama Raclawicka.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rac\u0142awice Panorama]] opened in 1894]]\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Austrian administration attempted to [[Germanisation|Germanise]] the city's educational and governmental institutions. Many cultural organisations which did not have a pro-German orientation were closed. After the [[revolutions of 1848]], the language of instruction at the university shifted from German to include Ukrainian and Polish. Around that time, a certain [[sociolect]] developed in the city known as the [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]]. Considered to be a type of Polish dialect, it draws its roots from numerous other languages besides Polish. In 1853, street lighting was introduced [[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] and Jan Zeh. In that year [[kerosene]] lamps were introduced as street lights. Then in 1858, these were updated to gas lamps, and in 1900 to electric ones.\n\nAfter the so-called \"[[Ausgleich]]\" of February 1867, the [[Austrian Empire]] was reformed into a dualist [[Austria-Hungary]] and a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. From 1873, Galicia was de facto an autonomous province of [[Austria-Hungary]] with Polish and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]], as official languages. Germanisation was halted and the censorship lifted as well. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the [[Diet of Galicia|Galician Sejm]] and provincial administration, both established in Lviv, had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs. The city started to grow rapidly, becoming the fourth largest in Austria-Hungary, according to the census of 1910. Many [[Belle \u00c9poque]] public edifices and tenement houses were erected, with many the buildings from the Austrian period, such as the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]], built in the [[Vienna|Viennese]] neo-Renaissance style.\n[[File:Sejm Galicyjski.jpg|thumb|[[Diet of Galicia|The Galician Sejm]] (till 1918), since 1920 the [[Jan Kazimierz University]]]]\n\nDuring Habsburg rule, Lviv became one of the most important Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish cultural centres. In Lviv, according to the Austrian census of 1910, which listed religion and language, 51% of the city's population were [[Roman Catholics]], 28% Jews, and 19% belonged to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. Linguistically, 86% of the city's population used the [[Polish language]] and 11% preferred the [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]].<ref name=\"New International\" /> At that time, Lviv was home to a number of renowned Polish-language institutions, such as the [[Ossolineum]], with the second largest collection of Polish books in the world, the Polish Academy of Arts, the National Museum (since 1908), the Historical Museum of the City of Lw\u00f3w (since 1891), the [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]], the [[Polish Historical Society]], [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]], with Polish as the official language since 1882, the [[Lw\u00f3w Scientific Society]], the [[Lviv National Art Gallery|Lw\u00f3w Art Gallery]], the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Polish Theatre]], and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Polish Archdiocese]].\n\nFurthermore, Lviv was the centre of a number of Polish independence organisations. In June 1908, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] founded here the [[Union of Active Struggle]]. Two years later, the paramilitary organisation, called the [[Riflemen's Association]], was also founded in the city by Polish activists.\n\nAt the same time, Lviv became the city where famous Ukrainian writers (such as [[Ivan Franko]], [[Panteleimon Kulish]] and [[Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky]]) published their work. It was a centre of Ukrainian cultural revival. The city also housed the largest and most influential Ukrainian institutions in the world, including the [[Prosvita]] society dedicated to spreading literacy in the Ukrainian language, the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]], the Dniester Insurance Company and base of the [[Ukrainian cooperative movement]], and it served as the seat of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]]. Lviv was also a major centre of Jewish culture, in particular as a centre of the [[Yiddish language]], and was the home of the world's first Yiddish-language daily newspaper, the ''Lemberger Togblat'', established in 1904.<ref>Paul Robert Magocsi.

On the night of 31 October\u20131 November 1918 the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic|Western Ukrainian People's Republic]] was proclaimed with Lviv as its capital. 2,300 Ukrainian soldiers from the [[Ukrainian Sich Riflemen|Ukrainian Sich Riflemen (Sichovi Striltsi)]], which had previously been a corps in the Austrian Army, took control over Lviv.

Following Warsaw, Lw\u00f3w was the second most important cultural and academic centre of interwar Poland. For example, in 1920 professor [[Rudolf Weigl]] of the Lw\u00f3w University developed a vaccine against [[typhus fever]]. Furthermore, the geographic location of Lw\u00f3w gave it an important role in stimulating international trade and fostering the city's and Poland's economic development. A major [[trade fair]] called ''[[Targi Wschodnie]]'' was established in 1921. In the academic year 1937\u20131938, there were 9,100 students attending five institutions of higher education, including the [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]] as well as the [[Lviv Polytechnic|Polytechnic]].<ref>''Ma\u0142y Rocznik Statystyczny 1939'' (Polish statistical yearbook of 1939), [[Central Statistical Office (Poland)]], Warsaw, 1939.</ref>\n\nWhile about two-thirds of the city's inhabitants were Poles, some of whom speak the characteristic [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]], the eastern part of the Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship had a relative [[Demographics of Ukraine|Ukrainian]] majority in most of its rural areas.

Military parades and commemorations of battles at particular streets within the city, all celebrating the Polish forces who fought against the Ukrainians in 1918, became frequent, and in the 1930s a vast [[Cemetery of the Defenders of Lw\u00f3w|memorial monument and burial ground of Polish soldiers]] from that conflict was built in the city's [[Lychakiv Cemetery]].\n\n=== World War II and the Soviet incorporation ===\n{{further|Battle of Lw\u00f3w (1939)}}\nGermany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 and by 14 September Lviv was completely encircled by German units.<ref>Robert M.

Following German occupation, the Jewish population was concentrated in the [[Lw\u00f3w Ghetto]] established in the city's Zamarstyn\u00f3w (today ''[[Zamarstyniv]]'') district, and the [[Janowska concentration camp]] was also set up.

Soon thereafter, the local commanders of Polish ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' were invited to a meeting with the commanders of the Red Army. During the meeting, they were arrested, as it turned out to be a trap set by the Soviet NKVD. Later, in the winter and spring of 1945, the local NKVD kept arresting and harassing Poles in Lviv (which according to Soviet sources on 1 October 1944 still had a clear Polish majority of 66.7%) in an attempt to encourage their emigration from the city. Those arrested were released only after they had signed papers in which they agreed to emigrate to Poland, which postwar borders were [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|to be shifted westwards]] in accordance with the [[Yalta conference]] settlements. In Yalta, despite Polish objections, the Allied leaders, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill decided that Lviv should remain within the borders of the Soviet Union. On 16 August 1945, a border agreement<ref>[[:pl:wikisource:Umowa graniczna pomi\u0119dzy Polsk\u0105 a ZSRR z 16 sierpnia 1945 roku]] [http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Umowa_graniczna_pomi%C4%99dzy_Polsk%C4%85_a_ZSRR_z_16_sierpnia_1945_roku] full text of the agreement {{in lang|pl}}</ref> was signed in Moscow between the [[government of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] installed by the Soviets in Poland. In the treaty, Polish authorities formally [[cession|ceded]] the prewar eastern part of the country to the Soviet Union, agreeing to the Polish-Soviet border to be drawn according to the [[Curzon Line]]. Consequently, the agreement was [[ratification|ratified]] on 5 February 1946.\n\n=== Post-war Soviet Union ===\n[[File:\u0421\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0427\u041a2.jpg|thumb|right|Sykhiv \u2013 Lviv's largest residential neighborhood, was built in the early 1980s under Soviet rule]]\n\nIn February 1946, Lviv became a part of the Soviet Union. It is estimated that from 100,000 to 140,000 Poles were resettled from the city into the so-called [[Recovered Territories]] as a part of [[Population transfer#Central Europe|postwar population transfers]], many of them to the area of newly acquired [[Wroc\u0142aw]], formerly the German city of Breslau. Many buildings in the old part of the city are examples of Polish architecture, which flourished in Lviv after the opening of the Technical School (later Polytechnic), the first higher-education technical academy on Polish lands. Polytechnic educated generations of architects which were influential in the entire country. Examples are: the main buildings of [[Lviv Polytechnic]], [[University of Lviv]], [[Lviv Opera]], [[Lviv railway station]], former building of Galicyjska Kasa Oszcz\u0119dno\u015bci, [[Potocki Palace, Lviv|Potocki Palace]].<ref>Ihor Zhuk, 'The Architecture of Lviv from the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Centuries', s. 113</ref> During the interwar period, Lviv was striving to become a modern metropolis, so architects experimented with modernism. It was the period of the most rapid growth of the city, so one can find many examples of architecture from this time in the city.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Examples include the main building of [[Lviv Academy of Commerce]], the second Sprecher's building or building of City Electrical Facilities.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} One monument of the Polish past is the [[Adam Mickiewicz Monument, Lviv|Adam Mickiewicz Monument]] at the square bearing his name.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Many Polish pieces of art and sculpture can be found in Lviv galleries, among them works by [[Jan Piotr Norblin]], [[Marceleo Bacciarelli]], [[Kazimierz Wojniakowski]], [[Antoni Brodowski]], [[Henryk Rodakowski]], [[Artur Grottger]], [[Jan Matejko]], [[Aleksander Gierymski]], [[Jan Stanis\u0142awski (painter)|Jan Stanis\u0142awski]], [[Leon Wycz\u00f3\u0142kowski]], [[J\u00f3zef Che\u0142mo\u0144ski]], [[J\u00f3zef Mehoffer]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski]], [[Olga Bozna\u0144ska]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw S\u0142owi\u0144ski]], [[Jacek Malczewski]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Poles who stayed in Lviv have formed the organisation the [[Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land]].\n\nAccording to various estimates, Lviv lost between 80% and 90% of its prewar population.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=T\u00f6rnquist-Plewa |editor1-first=Barbara |title=Whose Memory?

Immigration from Russia and Russian-speaking regions of Eastern Ukraine was encouraged{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}. The prevalence of the Ukrainian-speaking population has led to the fact that under the conditions of Soviet Russification,{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Lviv became a major centre of the [[Dissident movement in the Soviet Union|dissident movement in Ukraine]] and played a key role in Ukraine's independence in 1991.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the city expanded both in population and size mostly due to the city's rapidly growing industrial base. Due to the fight of [[SMERSH]] with the guerrilla formations of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] the city obtained a nickname with a negative connotation of ''Banderstadt'' as the City of [[Stepan Bandera]]. The German suffix for city ''stadt'' was added instead of the Russian ''grad'' to imply alienation. Over the years the residents of the city found this so ridiculous that even people not familiar with Bandera accepted it as a sarcasm in reference to the Soviet perception of western Ukraine. In the period of [[Perestroika|liberalisation from the Soviet system]] in the 1980s, the city became the centre of political movements advocating Ukrainian independence from the USSR. By the time of the fall of the Soviet Union the name became a proud mark for the Lviv natives culminating in the creation of a local rock band under the name ''Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu'' (Boys from Banderstadt).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bandershtadt.w6.ru/ |title=Official site of the Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu |publisher=Bandershtadt.w6.ru |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Independent Ukraine ===\nCitizens of Lviv strongly supported [[Viktor Yushchenko]] during the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] and played a key role in the [[Orange Revolution]].

After Casimir III conquered Lviv in 1349 the Jewish citizens received many privileges equal to that of other citizens of Poland. Lviv had two separate [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarters]], one within the city walls and one outside on the outskirts of the city. Each had its separate [[synagogue]], although they shared a cemetery, which was also used by the [[Crimean Karaite]] community. Before 1939 there were 97 synagogues.\n\nBefore the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] about one-third of the city's population was made up of Jews (more than 140,000 on the eve of World War II). This number swelled to about 240,000 by the end of 1940 as tens of thousands of Jews fled from the Nazi-occupied parts of Poland into the relative (and temporary) sanctuary of Soviet-occupied Poland (including Lviv) following the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact that divided Poland into Nazi and Soviet zones in 1939. Almost all these Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Meanwhile, the Nazis also destroyed the Jewish cemetery, which was subsequently \"paved over by the Soviets\".<ref name=\"erasedvanishingtraces\"/>\n\nAfter the war, a new Jewish population was formed from among the hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians that migrated to the city. The post-war Jewish population peaked at 30,000 in the 1970s. Currently, the Jewish population has shrunk considerably as a result of [[emigration]] (mainly to Israel and the United States) and, to a lesser degree, [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]], and is estimated at 1,100. A number of organisations continue to be active.\n\nThe [[Sholem Aleichem]] Jewish Culture Society in Lviv initiated the construction of a monument to the victims of the [[ghetto]] in 1988.

The city is known as a centre of art, literature, music and theatre.

In recent centuries Lviv was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other [[List of cities in Ukraine|Ukrainian cities]]. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. \nAfter the fires of 1527 and 1556 Lviv lost most of its [[gothic architecture|gothic]]-style buildings but it retains many buildings in [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[baroque architecture|baroque]] and the [[classical architecture|classic]] styles. There are works by artists of the [[Vienna Secession]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].\n\nThe buildings have many stone sculptures and carvings, particularly on large doors, which are hundreds of years old. The remains of old churches dot the central cityscape. Some three- to five-storey buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottoes in various states of repair. Some cemeteries are of interest: for example, the [[Lychakiv Cemetery|Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] where the Polish elite was buried for centuries. Leaving the central area the [[architectural style]] changes radically as Soviet-era [[high-rise]] blocks dominate. In the centre of the city, the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]] is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.\n\nFile:ProspektSvobodyLviv.jpg|Early 20th century architecture in Lviv\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:Lviv - Church of Transfiguration 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the [[Church of Transfiguration, Lviv|Church of the Transfiguration]]]]\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0432 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Dormition Church, Lviv|Church of the Assumption]]]]\n[[File:Chapel-of-Boim-family.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chapel of the Boim family]]]]\n\nOutdoor sculptures in the city commemorate many notable individuals and topics reflecting the rich and complex [[history of Lviv]]. There are monuments to [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Ivan Franko]], [[Daniel of Galicia|King Danylo]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], [[Ioan Potcoav\u0103|Ivan Pidkova]], [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Jan Kili\u0144ski]], [[Ivan Trush]], [[Saint George]], [[Wojciech Bartosz G\u0142owacki|Bartosz G\u0142owacki]], the monument to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], to [[Nikifor]], [[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]], [[Stepan Bandera]], [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], and many others.\n\nDuring the [[interwar period]] there were monuments commemorating important figures of the history of Poland. Some of them were moved to the Polish \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" after World War II, like the monument to [[Aleksander Fredro]] which now is in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], the monument of King [[John III Sobieski]] which after 1945 was moved to [[Gda\u0144sk]], and the monument of [[Kornel Ujejski]] which is now in [[Szczecin]]. A book market takes place around the monument to [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan F\u0435dorovych]], a typographer in the 16th century who fled Moscow and found a new home in Lviv.\n\nNew ideas came to Lviv during the Austro\u2013Hungarian rule. In the 19th century, many [[publishing]] houses, newspapers and magazines were established. Among these was the [[Ossolineum]] which was one of the most important Polish scientific libraries. Most Polish-language books and publications of the Ossolineum library are still kept in a local Jesuit church. In 1997 the Polish government asked the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] to return these documents to Poland. Subsequently, in 2003 Ukraine allowed access to these publications for the first time. In 2006 an office of the Ossolineum (which now is located in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]) was opened in Lviv and began a process to scan all its documents. Works written in Lviv contributed to Austrian, [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian]], Yiddish, and [[Polish literature]], with a multitude of translations.\n\n=== Religion ===\nLviv is a city of religious variety. [[Religion]] (2012): Catholic: 57% ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] 56% and [[Roman Catholic Church]] 1%) [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]]: 32%, [[Protestantism]]: 2% [[Judaism]] : 0.1% Other religion: 3% Indifferent to religious matters: 4% [[Atheism]]: 1.9%<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045226/http://city-institute.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=231:who-is-he-the-citizen-of-lviv&catid=1:latest Who is he, the citizen of Lviv?| Lviv City Institute].</ref>\n\n==== Christianity ====\nAt one point, over 60 churches existed in the city. The largest [[Christian Church]]es have existed in the city since the 13th century. There are three major Christian groups: The [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv]], the [[Roman Catholics]], and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]]. Each has had a diocesan seat in Lviv since the 16th century. At the end of the 16th century, the Orthodox community in Ukraine [[Union of Brest|transferred their allegiance]] to the [[Pope]] in Rome and became the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. This bond was forcibly dissolved in 1946 by the Soviet authorities and the Roman Catholic community was forced out by the expulsion of the Polish population. Since 1989, religious life in Lviv has experienced a revival.\n\nLviv is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], the centre of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ukraine|Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine]] and until 21 August 2005 was the centre of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. About 35 percent of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5 percent to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], 9 per cent to the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate|Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kiev Patriarchate]] and 6 per cent to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nUntil 2005, Lviv was the only city with two Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]]: [[Lubomyr Husar]] ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Byzantine Rite]]) and [[Marian Jaworski]] ([[Catholic Church|Latin Rite]]).\n\nIn June 2001, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the [[Latin Cathedral, Lviv|Latin Cathedral]], [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] and the [[Armenian Cathedral, Lviv|Armenian Cathedral]].\n\n==== Judaism ====\nLviv historically had a large and active Jewish community and until 1941 at least 45 [[synagogue]]s and prayer houses existed. Even in the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today's old town with the other in the [[Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie]]. The [[Golden Rose Synagogue (Lviv)|Golden Rose Synagogue]] was built in Lviv in 1582. In the 19th century, a more differentiated community started to spread out. Liberal Jews sought more [[cultural assimilation]] and spoke German and Polish. On the other hand, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 and 1944, the Germans in effect completely destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed and the Jewish population forced first into a ghetto before being forcibly transported to concentration camps where they were murdered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm#vip2|title=International Forum:\"Challenge of Holocaust and Its Lessons\"|work=Lviv Polytechnic National University Regional Holocaust Study Center: Ukrainian Holocaust History Study Center|date=November 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308035832/http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Soviet Union, synagogues remained closed and were used as warehouses or cinemas. Only since the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival.\n\nCurrently, the only functioning Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Lviv is the [[Beis Aharon V'Yisrael Synagogue]].\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:Lwowska Galeria Sztuki - Wn\u0119trza 01.JPG|thumb|left|A room in the <br /> [[Lviv National Art Gallery]]]]\n\nThe range of artistic Lviv is impressive. On the one hand, it is the city of classical art. Lviv Opera and Lviv Philharmonic are places that can satisfy the demands of true appraisers of the classical arts. This is the city of one of the most distinguished sculptors in Europe, [[Johann Georg Pinsel|Johann Georg Pinzel]], whose works can be seen on the fa\u00e7ade of the [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] in Lviv and in the Pinzel Museum. This is also the city of [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], who began her career as a singer of Lviv Opera and later became the prima donna of La Scala Opera in Milan.\n\nThe \"Group Artes\" was a young movement founded in 1929. Many of the artists studied in Paris and travelled throughout Europe. They worked and experimented in different areas of modern art: [[Futurism]], [[Cubism]], [[New Objectivity]] and [[Surrealism]]. Co\u2013operation took place between avant-garde musicians and authors. Altogether thirteen exhibitions by \"''Artes''\" took place in Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, \u0141\u00f3dz and Lviv. The German occupation put an end to this group. Otto Hahn was executed in 1942 in Lviv and Aleksander Riemer was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943.<ref>Kosmolinska, Natalia (2007). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFbmtdibpIMC&pg=PA224 Ein Fenster zur Moderne: Das Atelier der Sielskis].\" In: Hermann Simon, Irene Stratenwerth, & Ronald Hinrichs (Eds.), ''Lemberg: Eine Reise nach Europa'' Berlin: Christoph Links Verlag. pp. 218\u2013227; here: p. 224.</ref> Henryk Streng and Margit Reich-Sielska were able to escape the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] (or Shoah). Most of the surviving members of Artes lived in Poland after 1945. Only Margit Reich-Sielska (1900\u20131980) and Roman Sielski (1903\u20131990) stayed in Soviet Lviv. For years the city was one of the most important cultural centres of Poland with such writers as [[Aleksander Fredro]], [[Gabriela Zapolska]], [[Leopold Staff]], [[Maria Konopnicka]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]] living in Lviv.\n\nToday Lviv is a city of fresh ideas and unusual characters. There are about 20 galleries (The \"Dzyga\" Gallery, \u0410rt-Gallery \"Primus\", Gallery of the History of Ukrainian Military Uniforms, Gallery of Modern Art \"Zelena Kanapa\" and others). [[Lviv National Art Gallery]] is the largest museum of arts in Ukraine, with approximately 50,000 artworks, including paintings, sculptures and works of graphic art of Western and Eastern Europe, from the Middle Ages to modern days.\n\n=== Theatre and opera ===\n[[File:\u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430.JPG|thumb|The [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre]], an important cultural centre for residents and visitors]]\n\nIn 1842 the [[Skarbek Theatre]] was opened making it the third largest theatre in [[Central Europe]]. In 1903 the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv National Opera]] house, which at that time was called the City-Theatre, was opened emulating the [[Vienna State Opera]] house. The house initially offered a changing repertoire such as classical dramas in German and [[Polish language]], opera, operetta, comedy and theatre.\nThe opera house is named after the Ukrainian opera diva [[Solomiya Krushelnytska|Salomea Krushelnytska]] who worked here.\n\nNowadays [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]] has a large creative group of performers who strive to maintain traditions of Ukrainian opera and classical ballet. The Theatre is a well-organized creative body where over 500 people work towards a common goal. The repertoire includes 10 Ukrainian music compositions. No other similar theatre in Ukraine has such a large number of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] productions. There are also many operas written by foreign composers, and most of these operas are performed in the original language: ''Othello'', ''Aida'', ''La Traviata'', ''Nabucco'', and ''A Masked Ball'' by G. Verdi, ''Tosca'', ''La Boh\u00e8me'' and ''Madame Butterfly'' by G. Puccini, ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' by P. Mascagni, and ''Pagliacci'' by R. Leoncavallo (in Italian); ''Carmen'' by G. Bizet (in French), ''The Haunted Manor'' by S. Moniuszko (in Polish)\n\n=== Museums and art galleries ===\nMuseum Pharmacy \"Pid Chornym Orlom\" (Beneath the Black Eagle) was founded in 1735; it is the oldest pharmacy in Lviv. A museum related to pharmaceutical history was opened on the premises of the old pharmacy in 1966. The idea of creating such a museum had already come up in the 19th century. The Galician Association of Pharmacists was created in 1868; members managed to assemble a small collection of exhibits, thus making the first step towards creating a new museum. Nowadays, the exhibition has expanded considerably, with 16 exhibit rooms and a general exhibition surface totalling 700 sq. m. There are more than 3,000 exhibits in the museum. This is the only operating Museum Pharmacy in Ukraine and Europe.\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|The main building of [[Lviv National Museum]]]]\n\nThe most notable of the museums are [[Lviv National Museum]] which houses the National Gallery.

The classical pianist [[Mieczys\u0142aw Horszowski]] (1892\u20131993) was born here. The opera diva [[Solomiya Krushelnytska|Salomea Kruszelnicka]] called Lviv her home in the 1920s to 1930s. The classical violinist Adam Han Gorski was born here in 1940. \"''[[Polish Radio Lw\u00f3w]]''\" was a [[Polskie Radio|Polish radio]] station that went on-air on 15 January 1930. The programme proved very popular in Poland. [[Classical music]] and entertainment was aired as well as lectures, readings, youth-programmes, news and liturgical services on Sunday.\n[[File:PikkardiyskaTertsia01.jpg|thumb|[[Pikkardiyska Tertsiya]] \u2013 Ukrainian a cappella musical formation]]\nPopular throughout Poland was the [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Comic Lw\u00f3w Wave]] a [[cabaret]]-revue with [[musical composition|musical pieces]]. Jewish artists contributed a great part to this artistic activity. Composers such as [[Henryk Wars]], songwriters [[Emanuel Szlechter]] and [[Wiktor Budzy\u0144ski]], the actor [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Mieczys\u0142aw Monderer]] and [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Adolf Fleischer]] (\"''Aprikosenkranz und Untenbaum''\") worked in Lviv. The most notable stars of the shows were [[Henryk Vogelf\u00e4nger]] and [[Kazimierz Wajda]] who appeared together as the comic duo \"Szczepko and To\u0144ko\" and were similar to [[Laurel and Hardy]].\n\nThe Lviv Philharmonic is a major cultural centre with its long history and traditions that complement the entire culture of [[Ukraine]].

PikkardiyskaTertsia was created on 24 September 1992 in Lviv, and has won many musical awards. It all began with a quartet performing ancient Ukrainian music from the 15th century, along with adaptations of traditional Ukrainian folk songs.\n\n[[Lviv Organ Hall]] is a place where classical music (organ, symphonic, cameral) and art meet together. 50,000 visitors each year, dozens of musicians from all over the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\nLviv is also the hometown to one of the most successful and popular Ukrainian rock bands, [[Okean Elzy]].\n\n=== Universities and academia ===\n[[File:University Lviv 2009 1.JPG|thumb|left|The front [[Facade|fa\u00e7ade]] of the [[Lviv University]], the oldest university in Ukraine]]\n[[Lviv University]] is one of the oldest in Central Europe and was founded as a [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuit) school in 1608. Its prestige greatly increased through the work of philosopher [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866\u20131938) who was one of the founders of the [[Lw\u00f3w-Warsaw School of Logic]]. This [[school of thought]] set benchmarks for academic research and [[education]] in Poland. The Polish politician of the interbellum period [[Stanis\u0142aw G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski]] had served as dean of the law department (1889\u20131890) and as the University rector (1908\u20131909). In 1901 the city was the seat of the [[Lw\u00f3w Scientific Society]] among whose members were major scientific figures. The most well-known were the mathematicians [[Stefan Banach]], [[Juliusz Schauder]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam|Stanis\u0142aw Ulam]] who were founders of the [[Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics]] turning Lviv in the 1930s into the \"World Centre of Functional Analysis\" and whose share in Lviv academia was substantial.\n\nIn 1852 in [[Dublany, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Dublany]] ({{convert|8|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} from the outskirts of Lviv) the [[Agricultural Academy in Dublany|Agricultural Academy]] was opened and was one of the first Polish agricultural colleges.

Under the presidency of the historian, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], it greatly expanded its activities, contributing to both the humanities and the physical sciences, law and medicine, but most specifically once again it was concentrated onto the Ukrainian studies.\nThe Soviet Union annexed the eastern half of the Second Polish Republic including the city of Lw\u00f3w which capitulated to the Red Army on 22 September 1939. Upon their occupation of Lviv, the Soviets dissolved the Shevchenko society. Many of its members were arrested and either imprisoned or executed.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nLviv was the home of the [[Scottish Caf\u00e9]], where in the 1930s and the early 1940s, Polish [[mathematician]]s from the [[Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics]] met and spent their afternoons discussing mathematical problems.

An electric tram was introduced on 31 May 1894. The last horse-drawn line was transferred to electric traction in 1908. In 1922 the tramways were switched to driving on the right-hand side. After the annexation of the city by the Soviet Union, several lines were closed but most of the infrastructure was preserved. The tracks are [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]], unusual for the Soviet Union, but explained by the fact that the system was built while the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and needed to run in narrow medieval streets in the centre of town. The Lviv tramway system now runs about 220 cars on {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=off}} of track. Many tracks were reconstructed around 2006. The price in February 2019 of a tram/trolleybus ticket was 5 UAH (reduced fare ticket was 2.5 UAH, e.g. for students). The ticket may be purchased from the driver.\n\nAfter World War II the city grew rapidly due to evacuees returning from Russia, and the Soviet Government's vigorous development of [[heavy industry]]. This included the transfer of entire factories from the Urals and others to the newly \"liberated\" territories of the USSR. The city centre tramway lines were replaced with [[trolleybus]]es on 27 November 1952. New lines were opened to the [[Tower block|blocks of flats]] at the city outskirts. The network now runs about 100 trolleybuses \u2013 mostly of the 1980s Skoda 14Tr and [[:uk:\u041b\u0410\u0417 52522|LAZ 52522]]. In 2006\u20132008 11 modern [[Low floor|low-floor]] trolleybuses (LAZ E183) built by the [[Lviv Bus Factory]] were purchased. The public [[bus network]] is represented by mini-buses (so-called ''marshrutka'') and large buses mainly LAZ and MAN. On 1 January 2013 the city had 52 public bus routes. The price is 7.00 UAH regardless of the distance traveled.

Lviv railway is one of the oldest in Ukraine. The first train arrived in Lviv on 4 November 1861. The main [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Lviv Railway Station]], designed by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sad\u0142owski]], was built in 1904 and was considered one of the best in Europe from both the architectural and the technical aspects.\n\nIn the inter-war period, Lviv (known then as Lw\u00f3w) was one of the most important hubs of the [[Polish State Railways]]. The Lw\u00f3w junction consisted of four stations in mid-1939 \u2013 main station ''Lw\u00f3w G\u0142\u00f3wny'' (now {{lang-uk|Lviv Holovnyi}}), Lw\u00f3w Klepar\u00f3w (now ''Lviv Klepariv''), ''Lw\u00f3w \u0141yczak\u00f3w'' (now ''Lviv Lychakiv''), and ''Lw\u00f3w Podzamcze'' (now ''Lviv Pidzamche''). In August 1939 just before World War II, 73 trains departed daily from the Main Station including 56 local and 17 fast trains. Lw\u00f3w was directly connected with all major centres of the Second Polish Republic as well as such cities as Berlin, [[Bucharest]], and [[Budapest]].<ref>Urz\u0119dowy Rozk\u0142ad Jazdy i Lot\u00f3w PKP, Lato 1939 (Polish State Railroads Timetable, Summer 1939)</ref>\n\nCurrently, several trains cross the nearby Polish\u2013Ukrainian border (mostly via [[Przemy\u015bl]] in Poland). There are good connections to Slovakia ([[Ko\u0161ice]]) and Hungary ([[Budapest]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments. Lviv railway is often called the main gateway from Ukraine to Europe although buses are often a cheaper and more convenient way of entering the \"Schengen\" countries.\n\nLviv used to have a [[Railbus]], which has since been replaced with other means of public transport. It was a motor-rail car that ran from the largest district of Lviv to one of the largest industrial zones going through the central railway station. It made seven trips a day and was meant to provide a faster and more comfortable connection between the remote urban districts. The price in February 2010 of a one-way single ride in the rail bus was 1.50 UAH. On 15 June 2010, the route was cancelled as unprofitable.\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[File:Ph-mjp1.jpg|thumb|[[Lviv International Airport]]]]\nBeginnings of aviation in Lviv reach back to 1884 when the Aeronautic Society was opened there. The society issued its own magazine ''Astronauta'' but soon ceased to exist. In 1909 on the initiative of Edmund Libanski the Awiata Society was founded. Among its members there was a group of professors and students of the [[Lviv Polytechnic]], including [[Stefan Drzewiecki]] and Zygmunt Sochacki. Awiata was the oldest Polish organization of this kind and it concentrated its activities mainly on exhibitions such as the ''First Aviation Exhibition'' which took place in 1910 and featured models of aircraft built by Lviv students.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/lotniczy.html |title=Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow |publisher=Lwow.home.pl |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913\u20131914 brothers Tadeusz and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Floria\u0144scy built a two-seater aeroplane. When World War I broke out Austrian authorities confiscated it but did not manage to evacuate the plane in time and it was seized by the Russians who used the plane for intelligence purposes. The Floria\u0144ski brothers' plane was the first Polish-made aircraft. On 5 November 1918, a crew consisting of [[Stefan Bastyr]] and Janusz de Beaurain carried out the first ever flight under the [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] taking off from Lviv's Lewand\u00f3wka (now {{lang-uk|Levandivka}}) airport.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\" /> In the interbellum period Lw\u00f3w was a major centre of gliding with a notable ''Gliding School'' in Bezmiechowa which opened in 1932. In the same year the Institute of Gliding Technology was opened in Lw\u00f3w and was the second such institute in the world. In 1938 the ''First Polish Aircraft Exhibition'' took place in the city.\n\nThe interwar Lw\u00f3w was also a major centre of the [[Polish Air Force]] with the Sixth Air Regiment located there. The Regiment was based at the Lw\u00f3w airport opened in 1924 in the suburb of Skni\u0142\u00f3w (today {{lang-uk|Sknyliv}}).

Lviv is one of the main [[Ukrainian culture|cultural centres of Ukraine]].\n\nNamed in honour of [[Leo I of Galicia|Leo]], the eldest son of [[Daniel of Galicia|Daniel]], [[King of Ruthenia]], it was the capital of the [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]]<ref>Perfecky, George A. (1973). ''The Galician-Volynian Chronicle''. Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag. {{OCLC|902306}}</ref> from 1272 to 1349, when it was conquered by King [[Casimir III the Great]] of Poland. From 1434, it was the regional capital of the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, after the [[First Partition of Poland]], the city became the capital of the Habsburg [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. In 1918, for a short time, it was the capital of the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]. Between the wars, the city was the centre of the [[Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship]] in the [[Second Polish Republic]].\n\nAfter the German-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, Lviv became part of the [[Soviet Union]], and in 1944\u201346 there was a [[population exchange between Poland and Soviet Ukraine]]. In 1991, it became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.\n\nAdministratively, Lviv serves as the administrative centre of [[Lviv Oblast]] and has the status of [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]].\n\nLviv was the centre of the historical regions of [[Red Ruthenia]] and [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. The historical heart of the city, with its old buildings and cobblestone streets, survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II largely unscathed. The city has many industries and institutions of [[higher education]] such as [[Lviv University]] and [[Lviv Polytechnic]]. Lviv is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]]. The [[Old Town (Lviv)|historic city centre]] is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe#Ukraine|UNESCO World Heritage List]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Names ==\nBesides its Ukrainian name, and its ancient Ukrainian name of Lwihorod<ref>Hipolit Stupnicki.

The average altitude of Lviv is 296 metres (971 feet) above [[sea level]]. Its highest point is the ''Vysokyi Zamok'' ([[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]]), 409 meters (1342 feet) [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. This castle has a commanding view of the historic city centre with its distinctive green-domed churches and intricate architecture.\n\nThe old [[Defensive wall|walled city]] was at the foothills of the High Castle on the banks of the [[Poltva River|River Poltva]]. In the 13th century, the river was used to transport goods. In the early 20th century, the [[Poltva River|Poltva]] was covered over in areas where it flows through the city; the river flows directly beneath the central street of Lviv, Freedom Avenue (''Prospect Svobody'') and the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]].\n\n=== Climate ===\nLviv's climate is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with cold winters and mild summers.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Kottek | first = M.|author2=J.

The [[city council]] seal of the 14th century stated: S(igillum): ''Civitatis Lembvrgensis''. In 1358 the city became a seat of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], which initiated spread of [[Latin Church]] onto the Ruthenian lands.\n\nAfter Casimir had died in 1370, he was succeeded as king of Poland by his nephew, King [[Louis I of Hungary]], who in 1372 put Lviv together with the region of [[Kingdom of Galicia\u2013Volhynia]] under the administration of his relative [[Vladislaus II of Opole]], Duke of Opole.<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" /> When in 1387 W\u0142adys\u0142aw retreated from the post of its governor, Galicia-Volhynia became occupied by the [[Hungarians]], but soon [[Jadwiga of Poland|Jadwiga]], the youngest daughter of Louis, but also ruler of Poland and wife of King of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]], unified it directly with the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]].<ref name=\"Meyers Konversations-Lexikon\" />\n\n=== Kingdom of Poland ===\n[[File:Lviv High Castle (Engraving).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lviv High Castle]], fragment of engraving by A.

The kingdom was transformed into the Ruthenian domain of the Crown with capital in Lw\u00f3w. On 17 June 1356 King [[Casimir III the Great]] granted it [[Magdeburg rights]]. In 1362, the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]] was completely rebuilt with stone replacing the previous made out of wood.

First Catholic Archbishop who resided in Lviv was Jan Rzeszowski.\n\nIn 1434, the Ruthenian domain of the Crown was transformed into the [[Ruthenian Voivodeship]]. In 1444, the city was granted the [[staple right]], which resulted in its growing prosperity and wealth, as it became one of major trading centres on the merchant routes between [[Central Europe]] and [[Black Sea]] region. It was also transformed into one of the main fortresses of the kingdom, and was a royal city, like [[Krak\u00f3w]] or [[Gda\u0144sk]]. During the 17th century, Lw\u00f3w was the second largest city of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], with the population of about 30,000.\n\nIn 1572, one of the first publishers of books in what is now Ukraine, [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], a graduate of the [[Jagiellonian University|University of Krak\u00f3w]], settled here for a brief period. The city became a significant centre for [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] with the establishment of an Orthodox brotherhood, a Greek-Slavonic school and a printer which published the first full versions of the Bible in Church Slavonic in 1580. A [[List of Jesuit educational institutions in the Philippines|Jesuit Collegium]] was founded in 1608, and on 20 January 1661 King [[John II Casimir]] of Poland issued a decree granting it \"the honour of the academy and the title of the university\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manresa-sj.org/stamps/2_Ukraine.htm|title=Jesuits in Ukraine|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe 17th century brought invading armies of [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]], [[Hungary|Hungarians]],<ref>Cathal J.

In 1648 an army of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] and Crimean Tatars besieged the town. They captured the [[Lviv High Castle|High Castle]], murdering its defenders, but the city itself was not sacked due to the fact that the leader of the revolution [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] accepted a ransom of 250,000 ducats, and the Cossacks marched north-west towards [[Zamo\u015b\u0107]]. It was one of two major cities in Poland which was not captured during the so-called [[Deluge (history)|''Deluge'']]: the other one was [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig). At that time, Lw\u00f3w witnessed a historic scene, as here King John II Casimir made his famous [[Lw\u00f3w Oath]]. On 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lw\u00f3w's Cathedral, conducted by the [[papal legate]] [[Pietro Vidoni]], John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary's protection, whom he announced as ''The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries''. He also swore to ''protect the Kingdom's folk from any impositions and unjust bondage''.\n\nTwo years later, John Casimir, in honour of bravery of its residents, declared Lw\u00f3w to be equal to two historic capitals of the Commonwealth, Krak\u00f3w and [[Wilno]]. In the same year, 1658, [[Pope Alexander VII]] declared the city to be [[Semper fidelis]], in recognition of its key role in defending Europe and Roman-Catholicism from Muslim invasion.\n\nIn 1672 it was surrounded by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] who also failed to conquer it. Three years later, the [[Battle of Lw\u00f3w (1675)]] took place near the city. Lw\u00f3w was captured for the first time since the [[Middle Ages]] by a foreign army in 1704 when Swedish troops under King [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] entered the city after a short siege. The [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague]] of the early 18th century caused the death of about 10,000 inhabitants (40% of the city's population).<ref>Karl-Erik Frandsen.

Magocsi.(2005). ''Galicia: Multicultured Land.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press,  pg. 193</ref>\n\nIn 1773, the first newspaper in Lemberg, ''Gazette de Leopoli'', began to be published. In 1784, a [[latin language]] university was opened with lectures in German, Polish and even Ruthenian; after closing again in 1805, it was reopened in 1817. By 1825 German became the sole language of instruction.<ref name=\"multi\" />\n[[File:Lwow Panorama Raclawicka.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Rac\u0142awice Panorama]] opened in 1894]]\n\nDuring the 19th century, the Austrian administration attempted to [[Germanisation|Germanise]] the city's educational and governmental institutions. Many cultural organisations which did not have a pro-German orientation were closed. After the [[revolutions of 1848]], the language of instruction at the university shifted from German to include Ukrainian and Polish. Around that time, a certain [[sociolect]] developed in the city known as the [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]]. Considered to be a type of Polish dialect, it draws its roots from numerous other languages besides Polish. In 1853, street lighting was introduced [[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] and Jan Zeh. In that year [[kerosene]] lamps were introduced as street lights. Then in 1858, these were updated to gas lamps, and in 1900 to electric ones.\n\nAfter the so-called \"[[Ausgleich]]\" of February 1867, the [[Austrian Empire]] was reformed into a dualist [[Austria-Hungary]] and a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. From 1873, Galicia was de facto an autonomous province of [[Austria-Hungary]] with Polish and [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]], as official languages. Germanisation was halted and the censorship lifted as well. [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] was subject to the Austrian part of the Dual Monarchy, but the [[Diet of Galicia|Galician Sejm]] and provincial administration, both established in Lviv, had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs. The city started to grow rapidly, becoming the fourth largest in Austria-Hungary, according to the census of 1910. Many [[Belle \u00c9poque]] public edifices and tenement houses were erected, with many the buildings from the Austrian period, such as the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]], built in the [[Vienna|Viennese]] neo-Renaissance style.\n[[File:Sejm Galicyjski.jpg|thumb|[[Diet of Galicia|The Galician Sejm]] (till 1918), since 1920 the [[Jan Kazimierz University]]]]\n\nDuring Habsburg rule, Lviv became one of the most important Polish, Ukrainian and Jewish cultural centres. In Lviv, according to the Austrian census of 1910, which listed religion and language, 51% of the city's population were [[Roman Catholics]], 28% Jews, and 19% belonged to the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. Linguistically, 86% of the city's population used the [[Polish language]] and 11% preferred the [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]].<ref name=\"New International\" /> At that time, Lviv was home to a number of renowned Polish-language institutions, such as the [[Ossolineum]], with the second largest collection of Polish books in the world, the Polish Academy of Arts, the National Museum (since 1908), the Historical Museum of the City of Lw\u00f3w (since 1891), the [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]], the [[Polish Historical Society]], [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]], with Polish as the official language since 1882, the [[Lw\u00f3w Scientific Society]], the [[Lviv National Art Gallery|Lw\u00f3w Art Gallery]], the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Polish Theatre]], and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv|Polish Archdiocese]].\n\nFurthermore, Lviv was the centre of a number of Polish independence organisations. In June 1908, [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]] founded here the [[Union of Active Struggle]]. Two years later, the paramilitary organisation, called the [[Riflemen's Association]], was also founded in the city by Polish activists.\n\nAt the same time, Lviv became the city where famous Ukrainian writers (such as [[Ivan Franko]], [[Panteleimon Kulish]] and [[Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky]]) published their work. It was a centre of Ukrainian cultural revival. The city also housed the largest and most influential Ukrainian institutions in the world, including the [[Prosvita]] society dedicated to spreading literacy in the Ukrainian language, the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]], the Dniester Insurance Company and base of the [[Ukrainian cooperative movement]], and it served as the seat of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]]. Lviv was also a major centre of Jewish culture, in particular as a centre of the [[Yiddish language]], and was the home of the world's first Yiddish-language daily newspaper, the ''Lemberger Togblat'', established in 1904.<ref>Paul Robert Magocsi.

On the night of 31 October\u20131 November 1918 the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic|Western Ukrainian People's Republic]] was proclaimed with Lviv as its capital. 2,300 Ukrainian soldiers from the [[Ukrainian Sich Riflemen|Ukrainian Sich Riflemen (Sichovi Striltsi)]], which had previously been a corps in the Austrian Army, took control over Lviv.

Following Warsaw, Lw\u00f3w was the second most important cultural and academic centre of interwar Poland. For example, in 1920 professor [[Rudolf Weigl]] of the Lw\u00f3w University developed a vaccine against [[typhus fever]]. Furthermore, the geographic location of Lw\u00f3w gave it an important role in stimulating international trade and fostering the city's and Poland's economic development. A major [[trade fair]] called ''[[Targi Wschodnie]]'' was established in 1921. In the academic year 1937\u20131938, there were 9,100 students attending five institutions of higher education, including the [[Lviv University|Lw\u00f3w University]] as well as the [[Lviv Polytechnic|Polytechnic]].<ref>''Ma\u0142y Rocznik Statystyczny 1939'' (Polish statistical yearbook of 1939), [[Central Statistical Office (Poland)]], Warsaw, 1939.</ref>\n\nWhile about two-thirds of the city's inhabitants were Poles, some of whom speak the characteristic [[Lw\u00f3w dialect]], the eastern part of the Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship had a relative [[Demographics of Ukraine|Ukrainian]] majority in most of its rural areas.

Soon thereafter, the local commanders of Polish ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'' were invited to a meeting with the commanders of the Red Army. During the meeting, they were arrested, as it turned out to be a trap set by the Soviet NKVD. Later, in the winter and spring of 1945, the local NKVD kept arresting and harassing Poles in Lviv (which according to Soviet sources on 1 October 1944 still had a clear Polish majority of 66.7%) in an attempt to encourage their emigration from the city. Those arrested were released only after they had signed papers in which they agreed to emigrate to Poland, which postwar borders were [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|to be shifted westwards]] in accordance with the [[Yalta conference]] settlements. In Yalta, despite Polish objections, the Allied leaders, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill decided that Lviv should remain within the borders of the Soviet Union. On 16 August 1945, a border agreement<ref>[[:pl:wikisource:Umowa graniczna pomi\u0119dzy Polsk\u0105 a ZSRR z 16 sierpnia 1945 roku]] [http://pl.wikisource.org/wiki/Umowa_graniczna_pomi%C4%99dzy_Polsk%C4%85_a_ZSRR_z_16_sierpnia_1945_roku] full text of the agreement {{in lang|pl}}</ref> was signed in Moscow between the [[government of the Soviet Union]] and the [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] installed by the Soviets in Poland.

It is estimated that from 100,000 to 140,000 Poles were resettled from the city into the so-called [[Recovered Territories]] as a part of [[Population transfer#Central Europe|postwar population transfers]], many of them to the area of newly acquired [[Wroc\u0142aw]], formerly the German city of Breslau. Many buildings in the old part of the city are examples of Polish architecture, which flourished in Lviv after the opening of the Technical School (later Polytechnic), the first higher-education technical academy on Polish lands. Polytechnic educated generations of architects which were influential in the entire country. Examples are: the main buildings of [[Lviv Polytechnic]], [[University of Lviv]], [[Lviv Opera]], [[Lviv railway station]], former building of Galicyjska Kasa Oszcz\u0119dno\u015bci, [[Potocki Palace, Lviv|Potocki Palace]].<ref>Ihor Zhuk, 'The Architecture of Lviv from the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Centuries', s. 113</ref> During the interwar period, Lviv was striving to become a modern metropolis, so architects experimented with modernism.

Due to the fight of [[SMERSH]] with the guerrilla formations of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]] the city obtained a nickname with a negative connotation of ''Banderstadt'' as the City of [[Stepan Bandera]]. The German suffix for city ''stadt'' was added instead of the Russian ''grad'' to imply alienation. Over the years the residents of the city found this so ridiculous that even people not familiar with Bandera accepted it as a sarcasm in reference to the Soviet perception of western Ukraine. In the period of [[Perestroika|liberalisation from the Soviet system]] in the 1980s, the city became the centre of political movements advocating Ukrainian independence from the USSR. By the time of the fall of the Soviet Union the name became a proud mark for the Lviv natives culminating in the creation of a local rock band under the name ''Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu'' (Boys from Banderstadt).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bandershtadt.w6.ru/ |title=Official site of the Khloptsi z Bandershtadtu |publisher=Bandershtadt.w6.ru |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Independent Ukraine ===\nCitizens of Lviv strongly supported [[Viktor Yushchenko]] during the [[2004 Ukrainian presidential election]] and played a key role in the [[Orange Revolution]].

After Casimir III conquered Lviv in 1349 the Jewish citizens received many privileges equal to that of other citizens of Poland. Lviv had two separate [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarters]], one within the city walls and one outside on the outskirts of the city. Each had its separate [[synagogue]], although they shared a cemetery, which was also used by the [[Crimean Karaite]] community. Before 1939 there were 97 synagogues.\n\nBefore the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] about one-third of the city's population was made up of Jews (more than 140,000 on the eve of World War II). This number swelled to about 240,000 by the end of 1940 as tens of thousands of Jews fled from the Nazi-occupied parts of Poland into the relative (and temporary) sanctuary of Soviet-occupied Poland (including Lviv) following the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact that divided Poland into Nazi and Soviet zones in 1939. Almost all these Jews were killed in the Holocaust. Meanwhile, the Nazis also destroyed the Jewish cemetery, which was subsequently \"paved over by the Soviets\".<ref name=\"erasedvanishingtraces\"/>\n\nAfter the war, a new Jewish population was formed from among the hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians that migrated to the city. The post-war Jewish population peaked at 30,000 in the 1970s.

The city is known as a centre of art, literature, music and theatre. Nowadays, the indisputable evidence of the city cultural richness is a big number of theatres, concert halls, creative unions, and also the high number of many artistic activities (more than 100 festivals annually, 60 museums, 10 theatres).\n\n[[Old Town (Lviv)|Lviv's historic centre]] has been on the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage list]] since 1998. UNESCO gave the following reasons<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/865 L'viv&nbsp;\u2013 the Ensemble of the Historic Centre], UNESCO&nbsp;\u2013 World Heritage.

In recent centuries Lviv was spared some of the invasions and wars that destroyed other [[List of cities in Ukraine|Ukrainian cities]]. Its architecture reflects various European styles and periods. \nAfter the fires of 1527 and 1556 Lviv lost most of its [[gothic architecture|gothic]]-style buildings but it retains many buildings in [[renaissance architecture|renaissance]], [[baroque architecture|baroque]] and the [[classical architecture|classic]] styles. There are works by artists of the [[Vienna Secession]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]].\n\nThe buildings have many stone sculptures and carvings, particularly on large doors, which are hundreds of years old. The remains of old churches dot the central cityscape. Some three- to five-storey buildings have hidden inner courtyards and grottoes in various states of repair. Some cemeteries are of interest: for example, the [[Lychakiv Cemetery|Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] where the Polish elite was buried for centuries. Leaving the central area the [[architectural style]] changes radically as Soviet-era [[high-rise]] blocks dominate. In the centre of the city, the [[History of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]] is reflected mainly in a few modern-style national monuments and sculptures.\n\nFile:ProspektSvobodyLviv.jpg|Early 20th century architecture in Lviv\n\n=== Monuments ===\n[[File:Lviv - Church of Transfiguration 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Inside the [[Church of Transfiguration, Lviv|Church of the Transfiguration]]]]\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0432 \u041b\u044c\u0432\u043e\u0432.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Dormition Church, Lviv|Church of the Assumption]]]]\n[[File:Chapel-of-Boim-family.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Chapel of the Boim family]]]]\n\nOutdoor sculptures in the city commemorate many notable individuals and topics reflecting the rich and complex [[history of Lviv]]. There are monuments to [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Ivan Franko]], [[Daniel of Galicia|King Danylo]], [[Taras Shevchenko]], [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fedorov]], [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], [[Ioan Potcoav\u0103|Ivan Pidkova]], [[Mykhailo Hrushevskyi]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Jan Kili\u0144ski]], [[Ivan Trush]], [[Saint George]], [[Wojciech Bartosz G\u0142owacki|Bartosz G\u0142owacki]], the monument to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], to [[Nikifor]], [[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]], [[Stepan Bandera]], [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], and many others.\n\nDuring the [[interwar period]] there were monuments commemorating important figures of the history of Poland. Some of them were moved to the Polish \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" after World War II, like the monument to [[Aleksander Fredro]] which now is in [[Wroc\u0142aw]], the monument of King [[John III Sobieski]] which after 1945 was moved to [[Gda\u0144sk]], and the monument of [[Kornel Ujejski]] which is now in [[Szczecin]]. A book market takes place around the monument to [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan F\u0435dorovych]], a typographer in the 16th century who fled Moscow and found a new home in Lviv.\n\nNew ideas came to Lviv during the Austro\u2013Hungarian rule. In the 19th century, many [[publishing]] houses, newspapers and magazines were established. Among these was the [[Ossolineum]] which was one of the most important Polish scientific libraries. Most Polish-language books and publications of the Ossolineum library are still kept in a local Jesuit church. In 1997 the Polish government asked the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] to return these documents to Poland. Subsequently, in 2003 Ukraine allowed access to these publications for the first time. In 2006 an office of the Ossolineum (which now is located in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]) was opened in Lviv and began a process to scan all its documents. Works written in Lviv contributed to Austrian, [[Ukrainian literature|Ukrainian]], Yiddish, and [[Polish literature]], with a multitude of translations.\n\n=== Religion ===\nLviv is a city of religious variety. [[Religion]] (2012): Catholic: 57% ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] 56% and [[Roman Catholic Church]] 1%) [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]]: 32%, [[Protestantism]]: 2% [[Judaism]] : 0.1% Other religion: 3% Indifferent to religious matters: 4% [[Atheism]]: 1.9%<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140429045226/http://city-institute.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=231:who-is-he-the-citizen-of-lviv&catid=1:latest Who is he, the citizen of Lviv?| Lviv City Institute].</ref>\n\n==== Christianity ====\nAt one point, over 60 churches existed in the city. The largest [[Christian Church]]es have existed in the city since the 13th century. There are three major Christian groups: The [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv]], the [[Roman Catholics]], and the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]]. Each has had a diocesan seat in Lviv since the 16th century. At the end of the 16th century, the Orthodox community in Ukraine [[Union of Brest|transferred their allegiance]] to the [[Pope]] in Rome and became the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. This bond was forcibly dissolved in 1946 by the Soviet authorities and the Roman Catholic community was forced out by the expulsion of the Polish population. Since 1989, religious life in Lviv has experienced a revival.\n\nLviv is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lviv]], the centre of the [[Roman Catholicism in Ukraine|Roman Catholic Church in Ukraine]] and until 21 August 2005 was the centre of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. About 35 percent of religious buildings belong to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, 11.5 percent to the [[Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church]], 9 per cent to the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate|Ukrainian Orthodox Church \u2013 Kiev Patriarchate]] and 6 per cent to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nUntil 2005, Lviv was the only city with two Catholic [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinals]]: [[Lubomyr Husar]] ([[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Byzantine Rite]]) and [[Marian Jaworski]] ([[Catholic Church|Latin Rite]]).\n\nIn June 2001, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the [[Latin Cathedral, Lviv|Latin Cathedral]], [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] and the [[Armenian Cathedral, Lviv|Armenian Cathedral]].\n\n==== Judaism ====\nLviv historically had a large and active Jewish community and until 1941 at least 45 [[synagogue]]s and prayer houses existed. Even in the 16th century, two separate communities existed. One lived in today's old town with the other in the [[Krakowskie Przedmie\u015bcie]]. The [[Golden Rose Synagogue (Lviv)|Golden Rose Synagogue]] was built in Lviv in 1582. In the 19th century, a more differentiated community started to spread out. Liberal Jews sought more [[cultural assimilation]] and spoke German and Polish. On the other hand, [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] tried to retain the old traditions. Between 1941 and 1944, the Germans in effect completely destroyed the centuries-old Jewish tradition of Lviv. Most synagogues were destroyed and the Jewish population forced first into a ghetto before being forcibly transported to concentration camps where they were murdered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm#vip2|title=International Forum:\"Challenge of Holocaust and Its Lessons\"|work=Lviv Polytechnic National University Regional Holocaust Study Center: Ukrainian Holocaust History Study Center|date=November 2003|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308035832/http://www.holocaust.kiev.ua/eng/seminarse/lviv.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Soviet Union, synagogues remained closed and were used as warehouses or cinemas. Only since the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], has the remainder of the Jewish community experienced a faint revival.\n\nCurrently, the only functioning Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Lviv is the [[Beis Aharon V'Yisrael Synagogue]].\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:Lwowska Galeria Sztuki - Wn\u0119trza 01.JPG|thumb|left|A room in the <br /> [[Lviv National Art Gallery]]]]\n\nThe range of artistic Lviv is impressive. On the one hand, it is the city of classical art. Lviv Opera and Lviv Philharmonic are places that can satisfy the demands of true appraisers of the classical arts. This is the city of one of the most distinguished sculptors in Europe, [[Johann Georg Pinsel|Johann Georg Pinzel]], whose works can be seen on the fa\u00e7ade of the [[St. George's Cathedral, Lviv|St. George's Cathedral]] in Lviv and in the Pinzel Museum. This is also the city of [[Solomiya Krushelnytska]], who began her career as a singer of Lviv Opera and later became the prima donna of La Scala Opera in Milan.\n\nThe \"Group Artes\" was a young movement founded in 1929. Many of the artists studied in Paris and travelled throughout Europe. They worked and experimented in different areas of modern art: [[Futurism]], [[Cubism]], [[New Objectivity]] and [[Surrealism]]. Co\u2013operation took place between avant-garde musicians and authors. Altogether thirteen exhibitions by \"''Artes''\" took place in Warsaw, Krak\u00f3w, \u0141\u00f3dz and Lviv. The German occupation put an end to this group. Otto Hahn was executed in 1942 in Lviv and Aleksander Riemer was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943.<ref>Kosmolinska, Natalia (2007). \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFbmtdibpIMC&pg=PA224 Ein Fenster zur Moderne: Das Atelier der Sielskis].\" In: Hermann Simon, Irene Stratenwerth, & Ronald Hinrichs (Eds.), ''Lemberg: Eine Reise nach Europa'' Berlin: Christoph Links Verlag. pp. 218\u2013227; here: p. 224.</ref> Henryk Streng and Margit Reich-Sielska were able to escape the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] (or Shoah). Most of the surviving members of Artes lived in Poland after 1945. Only Margit Reich-Sielska (1900\u20131980) and Roman Sielski (1903\u20131990) stayed in Soviet Lviv. For years the city was one of the most important cultural centres of Poland with such writers as [[Aleksander Fredro]], [[Gabriela Zapolska]], [[Leopold Staff]], [[Maria Konopnicka]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]] living in Lviv.\n\nToday Lviv is a city of fresh ideas and unusual characters. There are about 20 galleries (The \"Dzyga\" Gallery, \u0410rt-Gallery \"Primus\", Gallery of the History of Ukrainian Military Uniforms, Gallery of Modern Art \"Zelena Kanapa\" and others). [[Lviv National Art Gallery]] is the largest museum of arts in Ukraine, with approximately 50,000 artworks, including paintings, sculptures and works of graphic art of Western and Eastern Europe, from the Middle Ages to modern days.\n\n=== Theatre and opera ===\n[[File:\u041b\u044c\u0432\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u041e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430.JPG|thumb|The [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre]], an important cultural centre for residents and visitors]]\n\nIn 1842 the [[Skarbek Theatre]] was opened making it the third largest theatre in [[Central Europe]]. In 1903 the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv National Opera]] house, which at that time was called the City-Theatre, was opened emulating the [[Vienna State Opera]] house. The house initially offered a changing repertoire such as classical dramas in German and [[Polish language]], opera, operetta, comedy and theatre.\nThe opera house is named after the Ukrainian opera diva [[Solomiya Krushelnytska|Salomea Krushelnytska]] who worked here.\n\nNowadays [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet]] has a large creative group of performers who strive to maintain traditions of Ukrainian opera and classical ballet. The Theatre is a well-organized creative body where over 500 people work towards a common goal. The repertoire includes 10 Ukrainian music compositions. No other similar theatre in Ukraine has such a large number of [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] productions. There are also many operas written by foreign composers, and most of these operas are performed in the original language: ''Othello'', ''Aida'', ''La Traviata'', ''Nabucco'', and ''A Masked Ball'' by G. Verdi, ''Tosca'', ''La Boh\u00e8me'' and ''Madame Butterfly'' by G. Puccini, ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' by P. Mascagni, and ''Pagliacci'' by R. Leoncavallo (in Italian); ''Carmen'' by G. Bizet (in French), ''The Haunted Manor'' by S. Moniuszko (in Polish)\n\n=== Museums and art galleries ===\nMuseum Pharmacy \"Pid Chornym Orlom\" (Beneath the Black Eagle) was founded in 1735; it is the oldest pharmacy in Lviv. A museum related to pharmaceutical history was opened on the premises of the old pharmacy in 1966. The idea of creating such a museum had already come up in the 19th century. The Galician Association of Pharmacists was created in 1868; members managed to assemble a small collection of exhibits, thus making the first step towards creating a new museum. Nowadays, the exhibition has expanded considerably, with 16 exhibit rooms and a general exhibition surface totalling 700 sq. m. There are more than 3,000 exhibits in the museum. This is the only operating Museum Pharmacy in Ukraine and Europe.\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|The main building of [[Lviv National Museum]]]]\n\nThe most notable of the museums are [[Lviv National Museum]] which houses the National Gallery. Its collection includes more than 140,000 unique items. The museum takes special pride in presenting the largest and most complete collection of medieval sacral art of the 12th to 18th centuries: icons, manuscripts, rare ancient books, decoratively carved pieces of art, metal and plastic artworks, and fabrics embroidered with gold and silver. The museum also boasts a unique monument of [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style: the Bohorodchansky Iconostasis. Exhibits include: Ancient Ukrainian art from the 12th to 15th centuries; Ukrainian art from the 16th to 18th centuries; and Ukrainian art from the end of the 18th to the beginning of the 20th centuries.\n\n=== Music ===\nLviv has an active musical and cultural life. Apart from the Lviv Opera, it has symphony orchestras, chamber orchestras and the Trembita Chorus. Lviv has one of the most prominent music academies and music colleges in Ukraine, the [[Lviv Conservatory]], and also has a factory for the manufacture of stringed musical instruments. Lviv has been the home of numerous composers such as Mozart's son [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart]], [[Stanyslav Lyudkevych|Stanislav Liudkevych]], [[Wojciech Kilar]] and [[Mykola Kolessa]].\n\nFlute virtuoso and composer [[Franz Doppler|Albert Franz Doppler]] (1821\u20131883) was born and spent his formative years here, including flute lessons from his father. The classical pianist [[Mieczys\u0142aw Horszowski]] (1892\u20131993) was born here. The opera diva [[Solomiya Krushelnytska|Salomea Kruszelnicka]] called Lviv her home in the 1920s to 1930s. The classical violinist Adam Han Gorski was born here in 1940. \"''[[Polish Radio Lw\u00f3w]]''\" was a [[Polskie Radio|Polish radio]] station that went on-air on 15 January 1930. The programme proved very popular in Poland. [[Classical music]] and entertainment was aired as well as lectures, readings, youth-programmes, news and liturgical services on Sunday.\n[[File:PikkardiyskaTertsia01.jpg|thumb|[[Pikkardiyska Tertsiya]] \u2013 Ukrainian a cappella musical formation]]\nPopular throughout Poland was the [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Comic Lw\u00f3w Wave]] a [[cabaret]]-revue with [[musical composition|musical pieces]]. Jewish artists contributed a great part to this artistic activity. Composers such as [[Henryk Wars]], songwriters [[Emanuel Szlechter]] and [[Wiktor Budzy\u0144ski]], the actor [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Mieczys\u0142aw Monderer]] and [[Weso\u0142a Lwowska Fala|Adolf Fleischer]] (\"''Aprikosenkranz und Untenbaum''\") worked in Lviv. The most notable stars of the shows were [[Henryk Vogelf\u00e4nger]] and [[Kazimierz Wajda]] who appeared together as the comic duo \"Szczepko and To\u0144ko\" and were similar to [[Laurel and Hardy]].\n\nThe Lviv Philharmonic is a major cultural centre with its long history and traditions that complement the entire culture of [[Ukraine]]. Exactly from the stage of Lviv Philharmonic began their way to the great art world-famous Ukrainian musicians \u2013 [[Oleh Krysa]], Oleksandr Slobodyanik, Yuriy Lysychenko, Maria Chaikovska, also the musicians of new generation \u2013 E. Chupryk, Y. Ermin, Oksana Rapita, Olexandr Kozarenko. Lviv Philharmonic is one of the leading concert institutions in Ukraine, which activities include various forms of promotion of the best examples of the music art \u2013 international festivals, cycles of concerts-monographs, concerts with participation of young musicians, etc.\n\nThe Chamber Orchestra \"Lviv virtuosos\" was organised of the best Lviv musicians in 1994. The orchestra consists of 16\u201340 persons / it depends on programmes/ and in the repertoire are included the musical compositions from Bach, Corelli to modern Ukrainian and European composers. During the short time of its operation, the orchestra acquired the professional level of the best European standards. It is mentioned in more than 100 positive articles of the Ukrainian and foreign musical critics.\n\nLviv is the hometown of the Vocal formation \"[[Pikkardiyska Tertsiya]]\" and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]] winner [[Ruslana]] who has since become well known in Europe and the rest of the world. PikkardiyskaTertsia was created on 24 September 1992 in Lviv, and has won many musical awards. It all began with a quartet performing ancient Ukrainian music from the 15th century, along with adaptations of traditional Ukrainian folk songs.\n\n[[Lviv Organ Hall]] is a place where classical music (organ, symphonic, cameral) and art meet together. 50,000 visitors each year, dozens of musicians from all over the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\nLviv is also the hometown to one of the most successful and popular Ukrainian rock bands, [[Okean Elzy]].\n\n=== Universities and academia ===\n[[File:University Lviv 2009 1.JPG|thumb|left|The front [[Facade|fa\u00e7ade]] of the [[Lviv University]], the oldest university in Ukraine]]\n[[Lviv University]] is one of the oldest in Central Europe and was founded as a [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuit) school in 1608. Its prestige greatly increased through the work of philosopher [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] (1866\u20131938) who was one of the founders of the [[Lw\u00f3w-Warsaw School of Logic]]. This [[school of thought]] set benchmarks for academic research and [[education]] in Poland. The Polish politician of the interbellum period [[Stanis\u0142aw G\u0142\u0105bi\u0144ski]] had served as dean of the law department (1889\u20131890) and as the University rector (1908\u20131909). In 1901 the city was the seat of the [[Lw\u00f3w Scientific Society]] among whose members were major scientific figures. The most well-known were the mathematicians [[Stefan Banach]], [[Juliusz Schauder]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam|Stanis\u0142aw Ulam]] who were founders of the [[Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics]] turning Lviv in the 1930s into the \"World Centre of Functional Analysis\" and whose share in Lviv academia was substantial.\n\nIn 1852 in [[Dublany, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Dublany]] ({{convert|8|km|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} from the outskirts of Lviv) the [[Agricultural Academy in Dublany|Agricultural Academy]] was opened and was one of the first Polish agricultural colleges. The Academy was merged with the [[Lviv Polytechnic]] in 1919. Another important college of the interbellum period was the [[Academy of Foreign Trade in Lw\u00f3w]].\n\nIn 1873 in Lviv was founded [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]] from the beginning it attracted the financial and intellectual support of writers and patrons of [[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian]] background.\n\nIn 1893 due to the change in its statute, the Shevchenko Scientific Society was transformed into a real scholarly multidisciplinary academy of sciences. Under the presidency of the historian, [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]], it greatly expanded its activities, contributing to both the humanities and the physical sciences, law and medicine, but most specifically once again it was concentrated onto the Ukrainian studies.\nThe Soviet Union annexed the eastern half of the Second Polish Republic including the city of Lw\u00f3w which capitulated to the Red Army on 22 September 1939. Upon their occupation of Lviv, the Soviets dissolved the Shevchenko society. Many of its members were arrested and either imprisoned or executed.\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nLviv was the home of the [[Scottish Caf\u00e9]], where in the 1930s and the early 1940s, Polish [[mathematician]]s from the [[Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics]] met and spent their afternoons discussing mathematical problems.

There are over 20 basic recreation park zones, 3 botanical gardens and 16 natural monuments. They offer a splendid chance to escape from city life or simply sit for a while among the trees, at a nice fountain or a lake. Each park has its individual character which reflects through various monuments and their individual history.\n\n* [[Ivan Franko Park]], is the oldest park in the city. Traces of that time may be found in three- hundred-year-old oak and maple trees. Upon the abrogation of the Jesuit order in 1773 the territory became the town property. A well-known gardener Bager arranged the territory in the landscape style, and most of the trees were planted within 1885\u20131890.\n* [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky Culture and Recreation Park]], is one of the best organised and modern green zones containing a concert and dance hall, stadium, the town of attractions, central stage, numerous cafes and restaurants. In the park there is a Ferris wheel.\n* [[Stryiskyi Park]], it is considered one of the most picturesque parks in the city. The park numbers over 200 species of trees and plants. It is well known for a vast collection of rare and valuable trees and bushes. At the main entrance gate, you will find a pond with swans.\n* [[Regional Landscape Park Znesinnya|Znesinnya Park]] is an ideal site for cycling, skiing sports, and hiking. Public organisations favour conducting summer camps here (ecological and educational, educational and cognitive).\n* [[Shevchenkivskyi Hay]], in the park there is an open-air museum of Ukrainian wooden architecture.\n* [[High Castle Park]], the park is situated on the highest city hill ({{convert|413|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and occupies the territory of {{convert|36|ha|abbr=off}} consisting of the lower terrace once called Knyazha Hora (Prince Mount), and the upper terrace with a television tower and artificial embankment.\n* [[Zalizni Vody Park]], the park originated from the former garden Zalizna Voda (Iron water) combining Snopkivska street with Novyi Lviv district. The park owes its name to the springs with high iron concentration. This beautiful park with ancient beech trees and numerous paths is a favourite place for many locals.\n* [[Lychakivskyi Park]], founded in 1892 and named after the surrounding suburbs. A botanic garden is situated on the park territory, founded in 1911 and occupying the territory of {{convert|18.5|ha|1|abbr=off}}.\n\n=== Sport ===\nLviv was an important centre for sport in Central Europe and is regarded as the birthplace of Polish [[Association football|football]]. Lviv is the Polish birthplace of other sports. In January 1905 the first Polish [[ice hockey|ice-hockey]] match took place there and two years later the first [[ski jumping|ski-jumping]] competition was organised in nearby [[Slavske|S\u0142awsko]]. In the same year, the first Polish basketball games were organised in Lviv's gymnasiums. In autumn 1887 a gymnasium by Lychakiv Street (pol. ''ulica \u0141yczakowska'') held the first Polish [[track and field]] competition with such sports as the [[long jump]] and [[high jump]]. Lviv's athlete W\u0142adys\u0142aw Ponurski represented Austria in the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic Games]] in [[Stockholm]]. On 9 July 1922 the first official [[rugby union|rugby]] game in Poland took place at the stadium of Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w in which the rugby team of Orze\u0142 Bia\u0142y Lw\u00f3w divided itself into two teams \u2013 \"The Reds\" and \"The Blacks\". The referee of this game was a Frenchman by the name of Robineau.\n\n[[File:EURO 2012 Lvov clock.jpg|thumb|left|Clock in Lviv on Prospekt Svobody (Freedom Ave.), showing time to start of EURO 2012. Opera and Ballet Theatre in background]]\nThe first known official goal in a Polish football match was scored there on 14 July 1894 during the Lw\u00f3w-Krak\u00f3w game. The goal was scored by [[W\u0142odzimierz Chomicki]] who represented the team of Lviv. In 1904 Kazimierz Hemerling from Lviv published the first translation of the rules of football into Polish and another native of Lviv, Stanis\u0142aw Polakiewicz, became the first officially recognised Polish referee in 1911 the year in which the first [[Polish Football Association|Polish Football Federation]] was founded in Lviv. The first Polish professional football club, [[Czarni Lw\u00f3w]] opened here in 1903 and the first stadium, which belonged to Pogo\u0144, in 1913. Another club, [[Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w]], was four times football champion of Poland (1922, 1923, 1925 and 1926). In the late 1920s as many as four teams from the city played in the Polish Football League (Pogo\u0144, Czarni, Hasmonea and Lechia). [[Hasmonea Lw\u00f3w|Hasmonea]] was the first Jewish football club in Poland. Several notable figures of Polish football came from the city including [[Kazimierz G\u00f3rski]], [[Ryszard Koncewicz]], [[Micha\u0142 Matyas]] and [[Wac\u0142aw Kuchar]].\n\nIn the period 1900\u20131911 opened most famous football clubs in Lviv.\nProfessor Ivan Bobersky has based in the Academic grammar school the first [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] sports circle where schoolboys were engaged in track and field, football, boxing, hockey, skiing, tourism and sledge sports in 1906.\nHe has organised the  \"Ukrainian Sports circle\" in 1908.\nMuch its pupils in due course in 1911 have formed a sports society with the loud name \"Ukraine\" \u2013  first Ukrainian football club of Lviv.<ref>[http://www.boberskiy.org.ua/indexe.html \"Ivan Bobersky \u2013 training of the first teachers of physical training is connected to his name.\"].</ref>\n\nLviv now has several major professional [[football team|football clubs]] and some smaller clubs. [[FC Karpaty Lviv]], founded in 1963, plays in the first division of the [[Ukrainian Premier League]]. Sometimes citizens of Lviv assemble on the central street (Freedom Avenue) to watch and cheer during outdoor broadcasts of games.\n\nThere are three major stadiums in Lviv. One of them is the [[Ukraina Stadium]] which is leased to FC Karpaty Lviv until 2018.\n[[Arena Lviv]] is a brand-new football stadium that was an official venue for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] Championship games in Lviv.

An electric tram was introduced on 31 May 1894. The last horse-drawn line was transferred to electric traction in 1908. In 1922 the tramways were switched to driving on the right-hand side. After the annexation of the city by the Soviet Union, several lines were closed but most of the infrastructure was preserved. The tracks are [[narrow gauge railway|narrow-gauge]], unusual for the Soviet Union, but explained by the fact that the system was built while the city was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and needed to run in narrow medieval streets in the centre of town. The Lviv tramway system now runs about 220 cars on {{convert|75|km|0|abbr=off}} of track. Many tracks were reconstructed around 2006. The price in February 2019 of a tram/trolleybus ticket was 5 UAH (reduced fare ticket was 2.5 UAH, e.g. for students). The ticket may be purchased from the driver.\n\nAfter World War II the city grew rapidly due to evacuees returning from Russia, and the Soviet Government's vigorous development of [[heavy industry]]. This included the transfer of entire factories from the Urals and others to the newly \"liberated\" territories of the USSR. The city centre tramway lines were replaced with [[trolleybus]]es on 27 November 1952. New lines were opened to the [[Tower block|blocks of flats]] at the city outskirts. The network now runs about 100 trolleybuses \u2013 mostly of the 1980s Skoda 14Tr and [[:uk:\u041b\u0410\u0417 52522|LAZ 52522]].

The public [[bus network]] is represented by mini-buses (so-called ''marshrutka'') and large buses mainly LAZ and MAN. On 1 January 2013 the city had 52 public bus routes.

Lviv railway is one of the oldest in Ukraine. The first train arrived in Lviv on 4 November 1861. The main [[Lviv Rail Terminal|Lviv Railway Station]], designed by [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sad\u0142owski]], was built in 1904 and was considered one of the best in Europe from both the architectural and the technical aspects.\n\nIn the inter-war period, Lviv (known then as Lw\u00f3w) was one of the most important hubs of the [[Polish State Railways]]. The Lw\u00f3w junction consisted of four stations in mid-1939 \u2013 main station ''Lw\u00f3w G\u0142\u00f3wny'' (now {{lang-uk|Lviv Holovnyi}}), Lw\u00f3w Klepar\u00f3w (now ''Lviv Klepariv''), ''Lw\u00f3w \u0141yczak\u00f3w'' (now ''Lviv Lychakiv''), and ''Lw\u00f3w Podzamcze'' (now ''Lviv Pidzamche''). In August 1939 just before World War II, 73 trains departed daily from the Main Station including 56 local and 17 fast trains. Lw\u00f3w was directly connected with all major centres of the Second Polish Republic as well as such cities as Berlin, [[Bucharest]], and [[Budapest]].<ref>Urz\u0119dowy Rozk\u0142ad Jazdy i Lot\u00f3w PKP, Lato 1939 (Polish State Railroads Timetable, Summer 1939)</ref>\n\nCurrently, several trains cross the nearby Polish\u2013Ukrainian border (mostly via [[Przemy\u015bl]] in Poland). There are good connections to Slovakia ([[Ko\u0161ice]]) and Hungary ([[Budapest]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Many routes have overnight trains with sleeping compartments. Lviv railway is often called the main gateway from Ukraine to Europe although buses are often a cheaper and more convenient way of entering the \"Schengen\" countries.\n\nLviv used to have a [[Railbus]], which has since been replaced with other means of public transport. It was a motor-rail car that ran from the largest district of Lviv to one of the largest industrial zones going through the central railway station. It made seven trips a day and was meant to provide a faster and more comfortable connection between the remote urban districts. The price in February 2010 of a one-way single ride in the rail bus was 1.50 UAH. On 15 June 2010, the route was cancelled as unprofitable.\n\n=== Air transport ===\n[[File:Ph-mjp1.jpg|thumb|[[Lviv International Airport]]]]\nBeginnings of aviation in Lviv reach back to 1884 when the Aeronautic Society was opened there. The society issued its own magazine ''Astronauta'' but soon ceased to exist. In 1909 on the initiative of Edmund Libanski the Awiata Society was founded. Among its members there was a group of professors and students of the [[Lviv Polytechnic]], including [[Stefan Drzewiecki]] and Zygmunt Sochacki. Awiata was the oldest Polish organization of this kind and it concentrated its activities mainly on exhibitions such as the ''First Aviation Exhibition'' which took place in 1910 and featured models of aircraft built by Lviv students.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lwow.home.pl/semper/lotniczy.html |title=Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow |publisher=Lwow.home.pl |accessdate=3 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913\u20131914 brothers Tadeusz and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Floria\u0144scy built a two-seater aeroplane. When World War I broke out Austrian authorities confiscated it but did not manage to evacuate the plane in time and it was seized by the Russians who used the plane for intelligence purposes. The Floria\u0144ski brothers' plane was the first Polish-made aircraft. On 5 November 1918, a crew consisting of [[Stefan Bastyr]] and Janusz de Beaurain carried out the first ever flight under the [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] taking off from Lviv's Lewand\u00f3wka (now {{lang-uk|Levandivka}}) airport.<ref name=\"Zdzislaw Sikorski, Lotniczy Lwow\" /> In the interbellum period Lw\u00f3w was a major centre of gliding with a notable ''Gliding School'' in Bezmiechowa which opened in 1932. In the same year the Institute of Gliding Technology was opened in Lw\u00f3w and was the second such institute in the world. In 1938 the ''First Polish Aircraft Exhibition'' took place in the city.\n\nThe interwar Lw\u00f3w was also a major centre of the [[Polish Air Force]] with the Sixth Air Regiment located there. The Regiment was based at the Lw\u00f3w airport opened in 1924 in the suburb of Skni\u0142\u00f3w (today {{lang-uk|Sknyliv}}).

In 2011 the City of Lviv ratified an ambitious 9-year program for the set-up of [[cycling infrastructure]]<ref>[http://www.city-adm.lviv.ua/news/images/stories/program_bicycle_network_lviv.pdf Lviv City Administration \u2013 Bicycle Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717123621/http://www.city-adm.lviv.ua/news/images/stories/program_bicycle_network_lviv.pdf |date=17 July 2011 }}</ref> \u2013 until the year 2019 an overall length of {{convert|270|km|0|abbr=on}} cycle lanes and tracks shall be realized. A working group formally organised within the City Council, bringing together representatives of the city administration, members of planning and design institutes, local NGOs and other stakeholders. Events like the All-Ukrainian Bikeday<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bikeday.org.ua |title=bikeday.org.ua |publisher=bikeday.org.ua |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> or the [[European Mobility Week]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilnist.org.ua/en/downloads/doc_download/43-european-mobility-week-2011-in-lvivukraine.html |title=Downloads &#124; Event Reports |publisher=Mobilnist.org.ua |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref> show the popularity of cycling among Lviv's citizens.\n\nBy September 2011, {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} of new cycling infrastructure had been built. It can be expected that until the end of the 2011 {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} will be ready for use. The cycling advisor in Lviv \u2013 the first such position in Ukraine \u2013 is supervising and pushing forward the execution of the cycling plan and coordinates with various people in the city. The development of cycling in Ukraine is currently hampered by outdated planning norms and the fact, that most planners didn't yet plan and experience cycling infrastructure. The update of national legislation and training for planners is therefore necessary.\n\nIn 2015, the first stations have been set up for a new [[bike-sharing]] system [[Nextbike]] \u2013 the first of its kind in Ukraine. New bike lanes are also under construction, making Lviv the most bike-friendly city in the country. The City Council plans to build an entire cycling infrastructure by 2020, with cycle lanes ({{convert|268|km|mi|abbr=off|disp=or}}) and street bike hire services.\n\n== Education ==\n{{Main|List of universities in Ukraine}}\n[[File:Lvivska politehnika2013.JPG|thumb|right|[[Lviv Polytechnic]] National University.]]\nLviv is an important education centre of Ukraine.

The technology for the [[Venera]] series probes and the first orbital shuttle [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] were also developed in Lviv.\n\nA considerable scientific potential is concentrated in the city: by the number of doctors of sciences, candidates of sciences, scientific organisations Lviv is the fourth city in Ukraine. Lviv is also known for ancient academic traditions, founded by the Assumption Brotherhood School and the Jesuit Collegium.

Also, sometimes referred to as Network Acceleration or piracy. \n\nNI is used as a middleware to capture and feed information to network operator applications for [[bandwidth management]], [[traffic shaping]], policy management, [[Convergent charging|charging and billing]] (including usage-based and content billing), [[service assurance]], [[revenue assurance]], market research mega panel analytics, [[lawful interception]] and cyber security.  It is currently being incorporated into a wide range of applications by vendors who provide technology solutions to [[Communications service provider|Communications Service Providers (CSPs)]], governments and large enterprises.

NI provides more granular analysis. It enables vendors to create an information layer with metadata from IP traffic to feed multiple applications for more detailed and expansive visibility into network-based activity.\n\nNI technology goes beyond traditional DPI, since it not only recognizes protocols but also extracts a wide range of valuable metadata. NI's value-add to solutions traditionally based on DPI has attracted the attention of industry analysts who specialize in DPI market research. For example, [http://www.heavyreading.com Heavy Reading] now includes NI companies on its Deep Packet Inspection Semi-Annual Market Tracker.<ref name=sherrington/>\n\n== Business Intelligence for data networks ==\nIn much the same way that BI technology synthesizes business application data from a variety of sources for business visibility and better decision-making, NI technology correlates network traffic data from a variety of data communication vehicles for network visibility, enabling better cyber security and IP services. With ongoing changes in communications networks and how information can be exchanged, people are no longer linked exclusively to physical subscriber lines. The same person can communicate in multiple ways \u2013 [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Webmail]], [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]], [[instant messaging]], [[online chat]], [[blogs]], [[Social network service|social networks]] \u2013 and from different access points via desktops, laptops and mobile devices.\n\nNI provides the means to quickly identify, examine and correlate interactions involving Internet users, applications, and protocols whether or not the protocols are [[Tunnelling protocol|tunneled]] or follow the [[OSI model]]. The technology enables a global understanding of network traffic for applications that need to correlate information such as who contacts whom, when, where and how, or who accesses what database, when, and the information viewed. When combined with traditional BI tools that examine service quality and customer care, NI creates a powerful nexus of subscriber and network data.\n\n== Use in telecommunications ==\nTelcos, [[Internet Service Provider|Internet Service Providers (ISPs)]] and [[Mobile network operator|Mobile Network Operators (MNOs)]] are under increasing competitive pressures to move to [[smart pipe]] business models. The cost savings and revenue opportunities driving smart pipe strategies also apply to [[Network Equipment Provider]]s, [[Independent software vendor|Software Vendors]] and [[Systems integrator|Systems Integrators]] that serve the industry.\n\nBecause NI captures detailed information from the hundreds of IP applications that cross mobile networks, it provides the required visibility and analysis of user demand to create and deliver differentiating services, as well as manage usage once deployed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Requirement\n! Purpose\n!

NI enables faster and more sophisticated [[Audience measurement|Audience Measurement]], User Behavior Analysis, [[Market segment|Customer Segmentation]], and Personalized Services.\n\nReal-time network metrics are equally important for companies to deliver and manage services. NI classifies protocols and applications from layers 2 through 7, generates metadata for communication sessions, and correlates activity between all layers, applicable for [[Optimization (computer science)|Bandwidth & Resource Optimization]], [[Quality of service|Quality of Service (QoS)]], Content-Based Billing, [[Quality of experience|Quality of Experience (QoE)]], VoIP Fraud Monitoring and [[Regulatory compliance|Regulatory Compliance]].\n\n== Use in cloud computing ==\nThe economics and deployment speed of [[cloud computing]] is fueling rapid adoption by companies and government agencies.<ref name=higginbotham/><ref name=idc/><ref name=sullivan/> Among concerns, however, are risks of [[information security]], [[e-discovery]], [[regulatory compliance]] and [[auditing]].<ref name=sienkiewicz/><ref name=schwartz/><ref name=brodkin/> NI mitigates the risks by providing [[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)]], [[Platform as a service|Platform as a Service (PaaS)]] and [[Software as a service|Software as a Service (SaaS)]] vendors with real-time [[situational awareness]] of network activity, and critical transparency to allay fears of potential customers. A vendor can demonstrate hardened network security to prevent [[Data leakage protection|Data Leakage]] or [[Data Theft]] and an irrefutable audit trail of all network transaction \u2013 communication and content \u2013 related to a customer's account, assuming compliance to regulation and standards.\n\n== Use in government ==\nNI extracts and correlates information such as who contacts whom, when where and how, providing [[situational awareness]] for [[Lawful interception|Lawful Interception]] and [[Cyber security|Cyber Security]]. Real-time data capture, extraction and analysis allow security specialists to take preventive measures and protect network assets in real time as a complement post-mortem analysis after an attack.\n\n== Use in business ==\nBecause NI combines real-time [[network monitoring]] with IP metadata extraction, it enhances the effectiveness of applications for [[Database security|Database Security]], [[Database audit|Database Auditing]] and Network Protection. The network visibility afforded by NI can also be used to build enhancements and next-generation solutions for [[Network performance management|Network Performance Management]], [[WAN optimization|WAN Optimization]], [[Customer experience management|Customer Experience Management]], [[Content filtering|Content Filtering]], and internal billing of networked applications.\n\n== References

The cost savings and revenue opportunities driving smart pipe strategies also apply to [[Network Equipment Provider]]s, [[Independent software vendor|Software Vendors]] and [[Systems integrator|Systems Integrators]] that serve the industry.\n\nBecause NI captures detailed information from the hundreds of IP applications that cross mobile networks, it provides the required visibility and analysis of user demand to create and deliver differentiating services, as well as manage usage once deployed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

NI enables faster and more sophisticated [[Audience measurement|Audience Measurement]], User Behavior Analysis, [[Market segment|Customer Segmentation]], and Personalized Services.\n\nReal-time network metrics are equally important for companies to deliver and manage services. NI classifies protocols and applications from layers 2 through 7, generates metadata for communication sessions, and correlates activity between all layers, applicable for [[Optimization (computer science)|Bandwidth & Resource Optimization]], [[Quality of service|Quality of Service (QoS)]], Content-Based Billing, [[Quality of experience|Quality of Experience (QoE)]], VoIP Fraud Monitoring and [[Regulatory compliance|Regulatory Compliance]].\n\n== Use in cloud computing ==\nThe economics and deployment speed of [[cloud computing]] is fueling rapid adoption by companies and government agencies.<ref name=higginbotham/><ref name=idc/><ref name=sullivan/> Among concerns, however, are risks of [[information security]], [[e-discovery]], [[regulatory compliance]] and [[auditing]].<ref name=sienkiewicz/><ref name=schwartz/><ref name=brodkin/> NI mitigates the risks by providing [[Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)]], [[Platform as a service|Platform as a Service (PaaS)]] and [[Software as a service|Software as a Service (SaaS)]] vendors with real-time [[situational awareness]] of network activity, and critical transparency to allay fears of potential customers. A vendor can demonstrate hardened network security to prevent [[Data leakage protection|Data Leakage]] or [[Data Theft]] and an irrefutable audit trail of all network transaction \u2013 communication and content \u2013 related to a customer\u2019s account, assuming compliance to regulation and standards.\n\n== Use in government ==\nNI extracts and correlates information such as who contacts whom, when where and how, providing [[situational awareness]] for [[Lawful interception|Lawful Interception]] and [[Cyber security|Cyber Security]]. Real-time data capture, extraction and analysis allow security specialists to take preventive measures and protect network assets in real time as a complement post-mortem analysis after an attack.\n\n== Use in business ==\nBecause NI combines real-time [[network monitoring]] with IP metadata extraction, it enhances the effectiveness of applications for [[Database security|Database Security]], [[Database audit|Database Auditing]] and Network Protection. The network visibility afforded by NI can also be used to build enhancements and next-generation solutions for [[Network performance management|Network Performance Management]], [[WAN optimization|WAN Optimization]], [[Customer experience management|Customer Experience Management]], [[Content filtering|Content Filtering]], and internal billing of networked applications.\n\n== References
