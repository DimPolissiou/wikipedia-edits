In the archaeological record, there are well-defined traces of this expansion which allow the path it took to be followed and dated with a degree of certainty. In the mid-2nd millennium BC, a distinctive culture appeared suddenly in north-west Melanesia, in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], the chain of islands forming a great arch from [[New Britain]] to the [[Admiralty Islands]]. This culture, known as [[Lapita]], stands out in the Melanesian archeological record, with its large permanent villages on beach terraces along the coasts. Particularly characteristic of the Lapita culture is the making of pottery, including a great many vessels of varied shapes, some distinguished by fine patterns and motifs pressed into the clay. Within a mere three or four centuries between about 1300 and 900 BC, the Lapita culture spread 6000&nbsp;km further to the east from the Bismarck Archipelago, until it reached as far as [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]].{{sfn|Bellwood|1987|pp=45\u201365}} Lapita pottery persisted in places such as [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], and [[Fiji]] for many years after its upbringing to Western and Central Polynesia.

The Polynesians are then believed to have spread eastward from the Samoan Islands into the Marquesas, the Society Islands, the Hawaiian Islands and Easter Island; and south to New Zealand. The pattern of settlement also extended to the north of Samoa to the Tuvaluan atolls, with [[Tuvalu]] providing a stepping stone to migration into the [[Polynesian outliers|Polynesian Outlier communities]] in [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]].{{sfn|Bellwood|1987|pp=29, 54}}<ref name=\"Bayard\">{{cite book |last1=Bayard|first1=D.

A navigator has to be constantly aware of their surroundings. Navigators have to memorize where they have sailed from in order to know where they are. The sun was the main guide for navigators because they could follow its exact points as it rose and set. At night time they would switch to using the rising and setting points of the stars. When there are no stars because of a cloudy night or during midday, a navigator would use the winds and swells to guide them.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Nainoa|title=On Wayfinding|url=http://archive.hokulea.com/ike/hookele/on_wayfinding.html|website=Polynesian Voyaging Society|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}</ref> Through constant observation, navigators were able to detect changes in the speed of their canoes, their heading, and the time of day or night.\nPolynesian navigators employed a wide range of techniques including the use of the stars, the movement of ocean currents and wave patterns, the air and sea interference patterns caused by islands and [[atoll]]s, the flight of birds, the winds and the weather.<ref name=\"Gatty_1958\">{{harvnb|Gatty|1958}}.</ref>\n\n===Bird observation===\nCertain seabirds such as the [[white tern]] and noddy tern fly out to sea in the morning to hunt fish, then return to land at night.

In \"The Raft Book\",<ref>\"[https://blog.library.si.edu/blog/2016/02/22/be-your-own-navigator/ Be Your Own Navigator],\" ''Smithsonian Libraries Unbound'', 11 February 2016.</ref> a survival guide he wrote for the U.S. military during World War II, Gatty outlined various Polynesian navigation techniques for shipwrecked sailors or aviators to find land. There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds, and some say that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with the [[West Pacific Flyway]]. A voyage from Tahiti, the Tuamotus or the Cook Islands to New Zealand might have followed the migration of the [[long-tailed cuckoo]] (''Eudynamys taitensis'') just as the voyage from Tahiti to Hawai{{okina}}i would coincide with the track of the [[Pacific golden plover]] (''Pluvialis fulva'') and the [[bristle-thighed curlew]] (''Numenius tahitiensis''). \n\nIt is also believed that Polynesians, like many seafaring peoples, kept shore-sighting birds. One theory is that voyagers took a [[frigatebird]] (''Fregata'') with them. This bird's feathers become drenched and useless if it lands on water, so voyagers would release it when they thought they were close to land, and would follow it if it did not return to the canoe.<ref name=\"Gatty_1958\" />\n\n===Navigation by the stars===\n[[File:Mau-star-compass.png|thumb|Star compass of [[Mau Piailug]] taught in the [[Caroline Islands]], with North at top.

Stars, as opposed to planets, hold fixed celestial positions year-round, changing only their rising time with the seasons. Each star has a specific [[declination]], and can give a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] for navigation as it rises or sets. Polynesian voyagers would set a heading by a star near the horizon, switching to a new one once the first rose too high. A specific sequence of stars would be memorized for each route.<ref name=\"Lewis 1972\"/>\nThe Polynesians also took measurements of stellar elevation to determine their latitude. The latitudes of specific islands were also known, and the technique of \"sailing down the latitude\" was used.\n\nSome [[Compass rose#Sidereal compass rose|star compass]] systems specify as many as [[List of selected stars for navigation|150 stars]] stars with known bearings, though most systems have only a few dozen (illustration at right).<ref>[[Harold Gatty]] (1958).

Any star that passes through the [[zenith]] (overhead) moves along the [[celestial equator]], the basis of the [[equatorial coordinate system]].\n\n=== Swell ===\nThe Polynesians also used wave and swell formations to navigate. Many of the habitable areas of the Pacific Ocean are groups of islands (or atolls) in chains hundreds of kilometres long. Island chains have predictable effects on waves and currents. Navigators who lived within a group of islands would learn the effect various islands had on the swell shape, direction, and motion, and would have been able to correct their path accordingly.  Even when they arrived in the vicinity of an unfamiliar chain of islands, they may have been able to detect signs similar to those of their home. \n\nOnce they had arrived fairly close to a destination island, they would have been able to pinpoint its location by sightings of land-based birds, certain cloud formations, as well as the reflections shallow water made on the undersides of clouds. It is thought that the Polynesian navigators may have measured sailing time between islands in \"canoe-days\".<ref name=\"Gatty_1958\" />\n\nThe energy transferred from the wind to the sea produces wind waves. The waves that are created when the energy travels down away from the source area (like ripples) are known as swell. When the winds are strong at the source area, the swell is larger. The longer the wind blows, the longer the swell lasts. Because the swells of the ocean can remain consistent for days, navigators relied on them to carry their canoe in a straight line from one house (or point) on the star compass to the opposite house of the same name. Navigators were not always able to see stars; because of this, they relied on the swells of the ocean. Swell patterns are a much more reliable method of navigation than the actual waves which are determined by the local winds. Swells move in a straight direction which makes it easier for the navigator to determine whether the canoe is heading in the correct direction.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gooley|first1=Tristan|title=How to Read Water: Clues, Signs & Patterns from Puddles to the Sea|year=2016|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|location=NY|isbn=9781473615205}}</ref>\n\n==Routes==\n[[File:Tupaia's map, c. 1769.jpg|thumb|[[Tupaia (navigator)|Tupaia]]'s chart of Polynesia within 3200km of [[Ra'iatea]]. 1769, preserved in the British Museum.]]\nOn [[First voyage of James Cook|his first voyage of Pacific exploration]], Captain James Cook had the services of a Polynesian navigator, [[Tupaia (navigator)|Tupaia]], who drew a chart of the islands within a {{convert|2000|mi|km}} radius (to the north and west) of his home island of [[Ra'iatea]].

This caused debates over the reasons for the presence of the Polynesians in such isolated and scattered parts of the Pacific. According to [[Andrew Sharp (historian)|Andrew Sharp]], the explorer Captain [[James Cook]], already familiar with [[Charles de Brosses]]'s accounts of large groups of Pacific islanders who were driven off course in storms and ended up hundreds of miles away with no idea where they were, encountered in the course of one of his own voyages a castaway group of Tahitians who had become lost at sea in a gale and blown 1000 miles away to the island of [[Atiu]]. Cook wrote that this incident \"will serve to explain, better than the thousand conjectures of speculative reasoners, how the detached parts of the earth, and, in particular, how the South Seas, may have been peopled\".<ref name=\"Sharp_1963_16\">{{harvnb|Sharp|1963|p=16}}.</ref>\n\nBy the late 19th century to the early 20th century, a more generous view of Polynesian navigation had come into favor, creating a much romanticized view of their seamanship, canoes, and navigational expertise.

Thereafter the oral knowledge passed down for generations allowed for eventual mastery of traveling between known locations.<ref name=\"Sharp_1963\">{{harvnb|Sharp|1963}}.</ref> Sharp's reassessment caused a huge amount of controversy and led to a stalemate between the romantic and the skeptical views.<ref name=\"Finney_1963_5\" />\n\n[[File:Double hulled vaka, Rarotonga 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Doubled hulled ''vaka'' in [[Rarotonga]], 2010.]]\n\nBy the mid-to-late 1960s it was time for a new hands-on approach.

[[Navigator]]s travelled to small inhabited islands using [[wayfinding]] techniques and knowledge passed by [[oral tradition]] from master to apprentice, often in the form of song. Generally, each island maintained a [[guild]] of navigators who had very high status; in times of famine or difficulty, they could trade for aid or evacuate people to neighbouring islands. As of 2014, these traditional [[navigation]] methods are still taught in the [[Polynesian outlier]] of [[Taumako]] in the [[Islands of the Solomon Islands|Solomons]].\n\nPolynesian navigation used some navigational instruments, which predate and are distinct from the machined metal tools used by European navigators (such as the [[sextant]], first produced in 1730; the [[sea astrolabe]], from around late 15th century; and the [[marine chronometer]], invented in 1761). However, they also relied heavily on close observation of sea sign and a large body of knowledge from oral tradition.<ref name=\"Leisl Clark\">{{cite web |last=Clark |first=Liesl |title=Polynesia's Genius Navigators |date=15 February 2000 |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/polynesia-genius-navigators.html |accessdate=17 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nBoth [[wayfinding]] techniques and [[outrigger canoe]] construction methods have been kept as [[Trade secret|guild secrets]], but in the modern revival of these skills, they are being recorded and published.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Ancient Hawaii|Discovery and settlement of Hawaii}}\n[[File:Polynesia.png|thumb|A projection of the [[Polynesian triangle]] on the globe.]]\nBetween about 3000 and 1000 BC speakers of Austronesian languages spread through the islands of [[Southeast Asia]] \u2013 almost certainly starting out from [[Taiwan]],<ref name=\"howe20069298\">{{Citation |title=Vaka Moana: Voyages of the Ancestors \u2013 the discovery and settlement of the Pacific |last=Howe |first=K.

In the archaeological record, there are well-defined traces of this expansion which allow the path it took to be followed and dated with a degree of certainty. In the mid-2nd millennium BC, a distinctive culture appeared suddenly in north-west Melanesia, in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], the chain of islands forming a great arch from [[New Britain]] to the [[Admiralty Islands]]. This culture, known as [[Lapita]], stands out in the Melanesian archeological record, with its large permanent villages on beach terraces along the coasts. Particularly characteristic of the Lapita culture is the making of pottery, including a great many vessels of varied shapes, some distinguished by fine patterns and motifs pressed into the clay. Within a mere three or four centuries between about 1300 and 900 BC, the Lapita culture spread 6000&nbsp;km further to the east from the Bismarck Archipelago, until it reached as far as [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]].{{sfn|Bellwood|1987|pp=45\u201365}} Lapita pottery persisted in places such as [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], and [[Fiji]] for many years after its upbringing to Western and Central Polynesia.

The Polynesians are then believed to have spread eastward from the Samoan Islands into the Marquesas, the Society Islands, the Hawaiian Islands and Easter Island; and south to New Zealand. The pattern of settlement also extended to the north of Samoa to the Tuvaluan atolls, with [[Tuvalu]] providing a stepping stone to migration into the [[Polynesian outliers|Polynesian Outlier communities]] in [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]].{{sfn|Bellwood|1987|pp=29, 54}}<ref name=\"Bayard\">{{cite book |last1=Bayard|first1=D.

A navigator has to be constantly aware of their surroundings. Navigators have to memorize where they have sailed from in order to know where they are. The sun was the main guide for navigators because they could follow its exact points as it rose and set. At night time they would switch to using the rising and setting points of the stars. When there are no stars because of a cloudy night or during midday, a navigator would use the winds and swells to guide them.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Nainoa|title=On Wayfinding|url=http://archive.hokulea.com/ike/hookele/on_wayfinding.html|website=Polynesian Voyaging Society|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}</ref> Through constant observation, navigators were able to detect changes in the speed of their canoes, their heading, and the time of day or night.\nPolynesian navigators employed a wide range of techniques including the use of the stars, the movement of ocean currents and wave patterns, the air and sea interference patterns caused by islands and [[atoll]]s, the flight of birds, the winds and the weather.<ref name=\"Gatty_1958\">{{harvnb|Gatty|1958}}.</ref>\n\n===Bird observation===\nCertain seabirds such as the [[white tern]] and noddy tern fly out to sea in the morning to hunt fish, then return to land at night. Navigators seeking land sail opposite the birds' path in the morning and with them at night, especially relying on large groups of birds, and keeping in mind changes during nesting season.<ref name=\"Lewis 1972\">{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=David|title=We, the Navigators|date=1972|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=HI|isbn=9780824802295}}</ref>\n\n[[Harold Gatty]] suggested that long-distance Polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of [[bird migration]]s. In \"The Raft Book\",<ref>\"[https://blog.library.si.edu/blog/2016/02/22/be-your-own-navigator/ Be Your Own Navigator],\" ''Smithsonian Libraries Unbound'', 11 February 2016.</ref> a survival guide he wrote for the U.S. military during World War II, Gatty outlined various Polynesian navigation techniques for shipwrecked sailors or aviators to find land. There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds, and some say that there were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with the [[West Pacific Flyway]]. A voyage from Tahiti, the Tuamotus or the Cook Islands to New Zealand might have followed the migration of the [[long-tailed cuckoo]] (''Eudynamys taitensis'') just as the voyage from Tahiti to Hawai{{okina}}i would coincide with the track of the [[Pacific golden plover]] (''Pluvialis fulva'') and the [[bristle-thighed curlew]] (''Numenius tahitiensis''). \n\nIt is also believed that Polynesians, like many seafaring peoples, kept shore-sighting birds. One theory is that voyagers took a [[frigatebird]] (''Fregata'') with them. This bird's feathers become drenched and useless if it lands on water, so voyagers would release it when they thought they were close to land, and would follow it if it did not return to the canoe.<ref name=\"Gatty_1958\" />\n\n===Navigation by the stars===\n[[File:Mau-star-compass.png|thumb|Star compass of [[Mau Piailug]] taught in the [[Caroline Islands]], with North at top. Re-creation with shells on sand, with [[Satawalese]] ([[Trukic languages|Trukic]]) text labels, from the [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/ike/hookele/star_compasses.html |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rkR1hSvX?url=http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/ike/hookele/star_compasses.html |archive-date=5 August 2010 |title=Star Compasses |publisher=Polynesian Voyaging Society |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> See annotations on Commons.]]\nThe positions of the stars helped guide Polynesian voyages. Stars, as opposed to planets, hold fixed celestial positions year-round, changing only their rising time with the seasons. Each star has a specific [[declination]], and can give a [[bearing (navigation)|bearing]] for navigation as it rises or sets. Polynesian voyagers would set a heading by a star near the horizon, switching to a new one once the first rose too high. A specific sequence of stars would be memorized for each route.<ref name=\"Lewis 1972\"/>\nThe Polynesians also took measurements of stellar elevation to determine their latitude. The latitudes of specific islands were also known, and the technique of \"sailing down the latitude\" was used.\n\nSome [[Compass rose#Sidereal compass rose|star compass]] systems specify as many as [[List of selected stars for navigation|150 stars]] stars with known bearings, though most systems have only a few dozen (illustration at right).<ref>[[Harold Gatty]] (1958).

Any star that passes through the [[zenith]] (overhead) moves along the [[celestial equator]], the basis of the [[equatorial coordinate system]].\n\n=== Swell ===\nThe Polynesians also used wave and swell formations to navigate. Many of the habitable areas of the Pacific Ocean are groups of islands (or atolls) in chains hundreds of kilometres long. Island chains have predictable effects on waves and currents. Navigators who lived within a group of islands would learn the effect various islands had on the swell shape, direction, and motion, and would have been able to correct their path accordingly.  Even when they arrived in the vicinity of an unfamiliar chain of islands, they may have been able to detect signs similar to those of their home. \n\nOnce they had arrived fairly close to a destination island, they would have been able to pinpoint its location by sightings of land-based birds, certain cloud formations, as well as the reflections shallow water made on the undersides of clouds. It is thought that the Polynesian navigators may have measured sailing time between islands in \"canoe-days\".<ref name=\"Gatty_1958\" />\n\nThe energy transferred from the wind to the sea produces wind waves. The waves that are created when the energy travels down away from the source area (like ripples) are known as swell. When the winds are strong at the source area, the swell is larger. The longer the wind blows, the longer the swell lasts. Because the swells of the ocean can remain consistent for days, navigators relied on them to carry their canoe in a straight line from one house (or point) on the star compass to the opposite house of the same name. Navigators were not always able to see stars; because of this, they relied on the swells of the ocean. Swell patterns are a much more reliable method of navigation than the actual waves which are determined by the local winds. Swells move in a straight direction which makes it easier for the navigator to determine whether the canoe is heading in the correct direction.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gooley|first1=Tristan|title=How to Read Water: Clues, Signs & Patterns from Puddles to the Sea|year=2016|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|location=NY|isbn=9781473615205}}</ref>\n\n==Routes==\n[[File:Tupaia's map, c. 1769.jpg|thumb|[[Tupaia (navigator)|Tupaia]]'s chart of Polynesia within 3200km of [[Ra'iatea]]. 1769, preserved in the British Museum.]]\nOn [[First voyage of James Cook|his first voyage of Pacific exploration]], Captain James Cook had the services of a Polynesian navigator, [[Tupaia (navigator)|Tupaia]], who drew a chart of the islands within a {{convert|2000|mi|km}} radius (to the north and west) of his home island of [[Ra'iatea]].

Moreover, the Chumash word for \"sewn-plank canoe\", ''[[tomolo'o]]'', may have been derived from ''kumulaa'au'', a Hawaiian word meaning \"useful tree\".\n\nIn 2008, an expedition starting on the Philippines sailed two modern [[James Wharram|Wharram]]-designed catamarans loosely based on a Polynesian catamaran found in Auckland Museum New Zealand. The boats were built in the Philippines by an experienced boat builder to Wharram designs using modern strip plank with epoxy resin glue built over plywood frames. The catamarans had modern Dacron sails, Terylene stays and sheets with modern roller blocks. Wharram says he used Polynesian navigation to sail along the coast of Northern New Guinea and then sailed 150 miles to an island for which he had modern charts, proving that it is possible to sail a modern catamaran along the path of the Lapita Pacific migration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lapita-voyage.org/en/lapita_voyage.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303204449/http://www.lapita-voyage.org/en/lapita_voyage.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |title=Lapita Voyage \u2013 The first expedition following the migration route of the ancient Polynesians|first=Klaus |last=Hympendahl|accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref> Unlike many other modern Polynesian \"replica\" voyages the Wharram catamarans were not towed or escorted by a modern vessel with modern GPS navigation system, nor were they fitted with a motor.\n\nPolynesian contact with the prehispanic [[Mapuche]] culture in central-south Chile has been suggested because of apparently similar cultural traits, including words like ''toki'' (stone axes and adzes), hand clubs similar to the [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] ''wahaika'', the sewn-plank canoe as used on Chiloe island, the ''curanto'' earth oven (Polynesian ''umu'') common in southern Chile, fishing techniques such as stone wall enclosures, a hockey-like game, and other potential parallels.

This caused debates over the reasons for the presence of the Polynesians in such isolated and scattered parts of the Pacific. According to [[Andrew Sharp (historian)|Andrew Sharp]], the explorer Captain [[James Cook]], already familiar with [[Charles de Brosses]]'s accounts of large groups of Pacific islanders who were driven off course in storms and ended up hundreds of miles away with no idea where they were, encountered in the course of one of his own voyages a castaway group of Tahitians who had become lost at sea in a gale and blown 1000 miles away to the island of [[Atiu]]. Cook wrote that this incident \"will serve to explain, better than the thousand conjectures of speculative reasoners, how the detached parts of the earth, and, in particular, how the South Seas, may have been peopled\".<ref name=\"Sharp_1963_16\">{{harvnb|Sharp|1963|p=16}}.</ref>\n\nBy the late 19th century to the early 20th century, a more generous view of Polynesian navigation had come into favor, creating a much romanticized view of their seamanship, canoes, and navigational expertise. Late 19th and early 20th centuries writers such as [[Abraham Fornander]] and [[Percy Smith (ethnologist)|Percy Smith]] told of heroic Polynesians migrating in great coordinated fleets from Asia far and wide into present-day Polynesia.<ref name=\"Finney_1963_5\">{{harvnb|Finney|1963|p=5}}.</ref>\n\nAnother view was presented by Andrew Sharp who challenged the \"heroic vision\" hypothesis, asserting instead that Polynesian maritime expertise was severely limited in the field of exploration and that as a result the settlement of Polynesia had been the result of luck, random island sightings, and drifting, rather than as organized voyages of colonization. Thereafter the oral knowledge passed down for generations allowed for eventual mastery of traveling between known locations.<ref name=\"Sharp_1963\">{{harvnb|Sharp|1963}}.</ref> Sharp's reassessment caused a huge amount of controversy and led to a stalemate between the romantic and the skeptical views.<ref name=\"Finney_1963_5\" />\n\n[[File:Double hulled vaka, Rarotonga 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Doubled hulled ''vaka'' in [[Rarotonga]], 2010.]]\n\nBy the mid-to-late 1960s it was time for a new hands-on approach.

Finney tested the canoe in a series of sailing and paddling experiments in Hawaiian waters. At the same time, ethnographic research in the Caroline Islands in [[Micronesia]] brought to light the fact that traditional stellar navigational methods were still very much in everyday use there. The building and testing of proa canoes (''[[Wa (watercraft)|wa]]'') inspired by traditional designs, the harnessing of knowledge from skilled Micronesians, as well as voyages using stellar navigation, allowed practical conclusions about the seaworthiness and handling capabilities of traditional Polynesian canoes and allowed a better understanding of the navigational methods that were likely to have been used by the Polynesians and of how they, as people, were adapted to seafaring.<ref name=\"Finney_1963_69\">{{harvnb|Finney|1963|pp=6\u20139}}.</ref> Recent re-creations of Polynesian voyaging have used methods based largely on Micronesian methods and the teachings of a Micronesian navigator, [[Mau Piailug]].<ref>See also: [[Polynesian Voyaging Society]], [[Hokulea]].</ref>\n\nIn accordance with Polynesian oral tradition, the geography of Polynesian navigation pathways are said to resemble the geometric qualities of an octopus with head centred on [[Ra'i\u0101tea]] (French Polynesia) and tentacles spread out across the Pacific.<ref>E.

It was manufactured by [[J-TREC| Tokyu Car Corporation]], [[Hitachi]] for technical components, [[Nippon Sharyo]], [[Kinki Sharyo]], and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]]. The basic structure is similar to that of the subsequently manufactured vehicles like the [[201 series]] & the [[203 series]], but the difference is that the window shape is a two-pane window panels with the upper stage descending and the lower stage rising. All four manufacturers were introduced to the Yamanote line in March 1985, and in 1991, like the other trains, the Saha 204-0 was introduced as a 6-door intermediate carriage for Yamanote Line to be assigned as new Car No. 10 to be coupled and form 11-car Yamanote Line trainsets from December 1991.\n\nIn 2005, the Saha 204 intermediate carriages, were also transferred to the Saikyo line upon retirement from Yamanote Line, and also some of the existing Yamanote Line 205 series were transferred to the Keiyo line to continue their train operation until they ended on 2011. The trip number indicator of each leading car was initially introduced as a traditional roller-binding display as commonly used by other JNR rolling stocks, but in 1985, it was newly-installed for the first time with the LCD type trip number indicator display and also later replaced along with the 0-subseries mass-produced vehicles.\n\n\n*JR East 205-0 series gallery\n<gallery>\nFile:Yamanote Line 205 series set 30 Tabata Station 20030202.JPG|Yamanote Line 205-0 series set 30 in February 2003\nFile:Keihin-Tohoku 205 Nishi-Nippori 199202.jpg|A Keihin-Tohoku Line 205-0 series in February 1992\nFile:Model 205 -Saiky\u014d Line- of JR East.jpg|A Saikyo Line 205-0 series in November 2007\nFile:JR205-yokohama-line.JPG|A Yokohama Line 205-0 series in April 2008\nFile:JRE-205EMU-Musashino-KeiyoLine.jpg|Musashino Line (left) and Keiyo Line (right) 205-0 series trains in May 2006\nFile:Nanbu line 205kei Rapid.JPG|A Nambu Line 205-0 series in April 2011\nFile:JRE 205-KeiyouLine Commuter Special Rapid.jpg|A Keiyo Line 205-0 series (later design) in May 2008\n</gallery>\n\n*JR West 205-0 series gallery\n<gallery>\nFile:JNR-205-0EC.JPG|A JR-West 205-0 series in original livery in February 2006.

It was manufactured by [[J-TREC| Tokyu Car Corporation]], [[Hitachi]] for technical components, [[Nippon Sharyo]], [[Kinki Sharyo]], and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]]. The basic structure is similar to that of the subsequently manufactured vehicles like the [[201 series]] & the [[203 series]], but the difference is that the window shape is a two-pane window panels with the upper stage descending and the lower stage rising. All four manufacturers were introduced to the Yamanote line in March 1985, and in 1991, like the other trains, the Saha 204-0 was introduced as a 6-door intermediate carriage for Yamanote Line to be assigned as new Car No. 10 to be coupled and form 11-car Yamanote Line trainsets from December 1991.\n\nIn 2005, the Saha 204 intermediate carriages, were also transferred to the Saikyo line upon retirement from Yamanote Line, and also some of the existing Yamanote Line 205 series were transferred to the Keiyo line to continue their train operation until they ended on 2011. The trip number indicator of each leading car was initially introduced as a traditional roller-binding display as commonly used by other JNR rolling stocks, but in 1985, it was newly-installed for the first time with the LCD type trip number indicator display and also later replaced along with the 0-subseries mass-produced vehicles.\n\n\n*JR East 205-0 series gallery\n<gallery>\nFile:Yamanote Line 205 series set 30 Tabata Station 20030202.JPG|Yamanote Line 205-0 series set 30 in February 2003\nFile:Keihin-Tohoku 205 Nishi-Nippori 199202.jpg|A Keihin-Tohoku Line 205-0 series in February 1992\nFile:Model 205 -Saiky\u014d Line- of JR East.jpg|A Saikyo Line 205-0 series in November 2007\nFile:JR205-yokohama-line.JPG|A Yokohama Line 205-0 series in April 2008\nFile:JRE-205EMU-Musashino-KeiyoLine.jpg|Musashino Line (left) and Keiyo Line (right) 205-0 series trains in May 2006\nFile:Nanbu line 205kei Rapid.JPG|A Nambu Line 205-0 series in April 2011\nFile:JRE 205-KeiyouLine Commuter Special Rapid.jpg|A Keiyo Line 205-0 series (later design) in May 2008\n</gallery>\n\n*JR West 205-0 series gallery\n<gallery>\nFile:JNR-205-0EC.JPG|A JR-West 205-0 series in original livery in February 2006.

Announced on April 15, 2020, the iPhone SE serves as a successor to both the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone SE]] and the [[iPhone 8]] series. Pre-orders began on April 17, 2020, and the phone itself is planned to be released on April 24, 2020.\n\nThe second-generation SE shares the dimensions and form factor of the iPhone 8 (including its bezel and physical home button with [[Touch ID]]), but shares hardware components from the [[iPhone 11]] lineup, including the [[Apple A13]] processor (instead of the [[Apple A11|A11]] found in the iPhone 8).<ref>{{Cite news|last=Peters|first=Jay|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221293/iphone-se-vs-11-pro-specs-comparison-price-camera-size|title=How the second-gen iPhone SE compares to the iPhone 11|date=15 April 2020|work=The Verge|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> This follows the pattern set by the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation SE]] (which shared the dimensions and form factor of the older [[iPhone 5S]] but shared most of its internal hardware with the higher-end [[iPhone 6S|6S]]).\n\nAs with the previous SE, the new phone is positioned as an entry-level iPhone, lacking for instance the edge-to-edge display, gesture navigation, and [[Face ID]] of the higher-end models such as the [[iPhone 11]] and [[iPhone 11 Pro|11 Pro/Pro Max]].\n\n== History ==\nA successor to the first-generation iPhone SE had been a source of rumour since 2017, the year after the device was released.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/22/iphone-se-2-release-date-first-half-2018/ |title = iPhone SE 2 Again Rumored to Launch in First Half of 2018 |website = MacRumors |language = en |access-date = April 15, 2020 }}</ref> The name was also subject to speculation.

The phone's dimensions and external design are identical to that of the [[iPhone 8]] except for a centered Apple logo and no iPhone branding.

It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content. [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] has been replaced with Haptic Touch.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera, similar to the single camera system of the [[iPhone 8]] and the [[iPhone XR]]. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash. It is capable of recording 4K video at 24&nbsp;fps, 30&nbsp;fps, or 60&nbsp;fps, 1080p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps or 60&nbsp;fps, or 720p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps. The phone can also take panoramas up to 63&nbsp;MP, and is capable of shooting photos in burst mode. Compared to the iPhone 8, the new processor of the SE adds support for extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps, stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization. The SE's camera interface adopts \"QuickTake\" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" />\n\nThe front camera is 7&nbsp;MP with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> \n\nBoth the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting.

Announced on April 15, 2020, the iPhone SE serves as a successor to both the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone SE]] and the [[iPhone 8]] series. Pre-orders began on April 17, 2020, and the phone itself is planned to be released on April 24, 2020.\n\nThe second-generation SE shares the dimensions and form factor of the iPhone 8 (including its bezel and physical home button with [[Touch ID]]), but shares hardware components from the [[iPhone 11]] lineup, including the [[Apple A13]] processor (instead of the [[Apple A11|A11]] found in the iPhone 8).<ref>{{Cite news|last=Peters|first=Jay|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221293/iphone-se-vs-11-pro-specs-comparison-price-camera-size|title=How the second-gen iPhone SE compares to the iPhone 11|date=15 April 2020|work=The Verge|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> This follows the pattern set by the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation SE]] (which shared the dimensions and form factor of the older [[iPhone 5S]] but shared most of its internal hardware with the higher-end [[iPhone 6S|6S]]).\n\nAs with the previous SE, the new phone is positioned as an entry-level iPhone, lacking for instance the edge-to-edge display, gesture navigation, and [[Face ID]] of the higher-end models such as the [[iPhone 11]] and [[iPhone 11 Pro|11 Pro/Pro Max]].\n\n== History ==\nA successor to the first-generation iPhone SE had been a source of rumour since 2017, the year after the device was released.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/22/iphone-se-2-release-date-first-half-2018/ |title = iPhone SE 2 Again Rumored to Launch in First Half of 2018 |website = MacRumors |language = en |access-date = April 15, 2020 }}</ref> The name was also subject to speculation.

The phone's dimensions and external design are identical to that of the [[iPhone 8]] except for a centered Apple logo and no iPhone branding.

It can play [[HDR10]] and [[Dolby Vision]] content despite not having an HDR-ready display, done by down-converting the HDR content to fit the display while still having some enhancements to dynamic range, contrast, and wide color gamut compared to [[standard-dynamic-range video|standard]] content. [[Force Touch|3D Touch]] has been replaced with Haptic Touch.\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe iPhone SE features a single 12 MP rear camera, similar to the single camera system of the [[iPhone 8]] and the [[iPhone XR]]. The camera has a <!-- MOS:NOSYMBOLS -->f/1.8 aperture, autofocus, optical image stabilization, and a quad-LED True Tone flash. It is capable of recording 4K video at 24&nbsp;fps, 30&nbsp;fps, or 60&nbsp;fps, 1080p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps or 60&nbsp;fps, or 720p HD video at 30&nbsp;fps. The phone can also take panoramas up to 63&nbsp;MP, and is capable of shooting photos in burst mode. Compared to the iPhone 8, the new processor of the SE adds support for extended dynamic range video up to 30 fps, stereo recording and cinematic video stabilization. The SE's camera interface adopts \"QuickTake\" from the 11 and 11 Pro, which allows the user to long-press the shutter button to take a video.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" />\n\nThe front camera is 7&nbsp;MP with f/2.2 aperture and autofocus, capable of shooting 1080p HD video at 30 fps.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> \n\nBoth the front and rear cameras of the iPhone SE support Portrait mode and Portrait Lighting. Smart HDR is featured on the rear camera, but not the front camera.<ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\" /> Unlike the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, the iPhone SE does not support Night Mode, possibly due to being based on the iPhone 8 and iPhone XR single-camera systems.\n\n===Software===\nThe iPhone SE ships with [[iOS 13|iOS 13]].<!-- Apple Card is implicit with Apple Pay. --><ref name=\"Apple official website: specifications\"/>\n\n== Timeline of iPhone models ==\n{{Timeline of iPhone models}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|iPhone SE (2020)}}\n* {{Official site|https://www.apple.com/iphone-se/}}\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{Apple hardware since 1998}}\n{{Apple Inc. hardware}}\n{{Apple}}\n[[Category:IPhone|*]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 2020]]\n[[Category:iOS]]\n[[Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications]]\n", "name_user": "The ed17", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSpecifications:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_SE_(2nd_generation)"}

Its capital is [[Catbalogan City]]. It is bordered by [[Northern Samar]], [[Eastern Samar]], [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] and the [[Leyte Gulf]], and includes several islands in the [[Samar Sea]]. Samar is connected to the [[Leyte|island of Leyte]] via the [[San Juanico Bridge]] (Marcos Bridge).\n\nIn 1768, Leyte and modern Samar was created out of the [[Samar Province (1768-1965)|historical province of Samar]].  In 1965, Northern and Eastern Samar were created.\n\nFishing and agriculture are the major economic activities in the province.<ref>http://www.samar.lgu-ph.com/econo.htm Economical Data</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 2013, the province was significantly damaged by [[Typhoon Haiyan|Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan)]], particularly the towns of [[Basey, Samar|Basey]], [[Marabut, Samar|Marabut]] and [[Santa Rita, Samar|Santa Rita]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Samar'' is said{{by whom|date=May 2017}} to be derived from ''Samad'', the [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] word for \"wound\" or \"cut\", describing the rough physical features of the land which is rugged and deeply dissected by streams.\n\n==History==\n{{prose|date=April 2013}}\n\n* '''2 million-8,000 B.C''' \u2014 Based on geologic findings, during the ice ages or Pleistocene period (2 million years \u2013 8,000 B.C), the islands of Mindoro, Luzon, and Mindanao were connected as one big island through the islands of Samar, Leyte and Bohol.\n* '''8550 B.C.''' \u2014 Diggings in Sohoton Caves in Basey, Samar showed stone flake tools dated 8550 B.C.\n* '''1300''' \u2014 Other diggings along the Basey River revealed other stone flakes used until the 13th century.\n* '''1543''' \u2014 The explorer [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]], first came to the island and named it ''Las Islas Filipinas''.\n* '''1596''' \u2014 Many names (such as ''Samal'', ''Ibabao'', ''Tandaya'') were given to Samar Island prior to the coming of the Spaniards in 1596. The name \"Samar\" was derived from the local language ''samad,'' meaning \"wound\" or \"cut\", aptly describing the rough physical features of the island, rugged and deeply dissected by streams. Recent scholars connect the name Samar to the ancient city of Samaria, the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel. The early Datu of Samar, Iberein of Lawang Town, in the Northern part of the island may have a Samarian blood.  During the early days of Spanish occupation, Samar was under the jurisdiction of [[Cebu]].\n* '''Arrival of the First Missionaries Jesuits''' \u2014 On October 15, 1596, the first [[Jesuit]] Mission arrived in ''Tinago'' (now [[Dapdap]]) in [[Tarangnan]]. From Tinago, the missionaries Fr. [[Francisco de Otazo]], [[Bartolome Martes]], and [[Domingo Alonzo]] began teaching [[Catechism]] healing the sick and spread the [[Christianity]] faith into the interior settlements.\n* '''1649''' '''to 1650''' \u2014 On June 1, 1649, the people of [[Palapag]] led by [[Agustin Sumuroy]] revolted against the decree of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Diego Fajardo Chac\u00f3n|Diego Fajardo]] requiring able bodied men from the [[Visayas]] for service at the Cavite Shipyards. Like fire, the revolt quickly spread the neighboring town in the Northern and Western coast of Samar and to the nearby provinces of Bicol, [[Surigao (province)|Surigao]], [[Cebu]], [[Camiguin]] and as far as [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga]]. It was suppressed in 1650 by the combined forces of the [[Spaniards]], Lutaos, and Pampangos.\n* '''1735''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were united into one province with [[Carigara]], in Leyte, as the capital town.\n* '''1747''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were separated for administrative effectiveness.\n* '''1762''' \u2014 Complaints from the Jesuits that the division was not working well, thus it was reunited again by the approval from the King of Spain.\n* '''1768''' \u2014 Jesuits were expelled in all Spanish dominions. The Franciscans arrived on September 25, 1768 and succeeded the administration of 14 parishes which was under by the spiritual care of the Jesuits for almost 172 years. The remaining three parishes of Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey in the south of Samar went under the administration of the Augustinians.\n* '''1777''' \u2014 The two provinces were divided for the last time, it was approved in Madrid in 1786 and had been effective in 1799.\n* '''1803''' \u2014 Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey were turned over to the Franciscans for the lack of Augustinian priests. \n* '''Royal Decree declares Samar as a Province''' \u2014 On August 11, 1841, [[Isabel II of Spain|Queen Isabella II of Spain]] signed a [[Royal Decree]] declaring Samar as a province.\n* '''1900''' \u2014 The [[Siege of Catubig|Battle of Catubig]] (April 15\u201318, 1900) occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. On April 15, 1900, the Filipino guerrillas launched a surprise attack on a detachment of US 43rd Infantry Regiment, forcing the Americans to abandon Catubig town after the four-day siege.\n* '''1901''' \u2014 The [[Balangiga massacre]] occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. September 28, 1901, the people of [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]], [[Giporlos]], [[Lawaan]] and [[Quinapondan]] in [[Eastern Samar]] surprised and attacked the American forces station there, [[Balangiga massacre|killing 48 American soldiers]]. To avenge their defeat, American general [[Jacob H. Smith]] ordered his men to turn Samar into a \"howling wilderness\".\n* '''1910''' \u2014 On April 10, 1910, upon the papal bull of Pope Pius X separated the islands of Samar and Leyte from the Diocese of Cebu and erected the Diocese of Calbayog comprising both islands. Pablo Singzon de Anuncacion was named first Bishop and consecrated on June 12, 1910.\n* '''1941''' \u2014 The [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)|invasion by the Japanese]] via fighter and bomber planes.\n* '''1941''' to '''1942''' \u2014 Filipino troops of the [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st Infantry Division]], Philippine Commonwealth Army, and [[USAFFE]] (under the Visayan-Mindanao Force) were established, but all fell to the invading Japanese forces. The general headquarters in Samar also fell to the Japanese. This resulted in the defeat of the Filipino troops of the USAFFE 91st Division.\n* '''1942''' \u2014 The occupying [[Imperial Japanese forces]] arrived in the province of Samar.\n* '''1942''' \u2013 The established of the 3rd Samar Company of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were based at the general headquarters and camp base in [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]]. \n* '''1942''' to '''1944''' \u2014 During the occupation, thousands of local Samare\u00f1os \u2014 men and women \u2014 joined guerrilla groups in the province and helped local Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army units [[Philippine resistance against Japan|fight the Japanese Imperial forces]] which led to the latter's defeat and started the pre-Allied liberation.\n** The [[4th Infantry Division (Philippines)|4th]], [[9th Infantry Division (Philippines)|9th]], 93rd, 95th and 96th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were established from January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 at the military general headquarters and military camps. The military unit organizations started the anti-Japanese military operations in the province from 1942 to 1945.\n** The 96th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was founded and established from January 3, 1942 to June 30, 1946 at the military general headquarters in the province of Samar.\n** The [[Philippine Guerrilla Forces]] or PGF were established from 1942 to 1998 as a guerrilla resistance organization with headquarters in San Andres, [[Villareal, Samar]].\n* '''September 18, 1944''' \u2014 Filipino troops of the constable 9th Samar Company of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were ambushed at Barrio Cansumangay in [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar]] was fought against the Imperial Japanese force. The casualties almost 31 Japanese and 2 Filipinos killed in action. \n* '''1944''' \u2014 The [[Battle off Samar]] took place on October 24 as [[Vice Admiral]] [[Takeo Kurita]]'s Center Force warships clashed with several allied naval vessels in a collision course. His forces sank escort carrier {{USS|Gambier Bay|CVE-73}}, destroyers {{USS|Hoel|DD-533}} and {{USS|Johnston|DD-557}}, and escort destroyer {{USS|Samuel B.

Despite being a tactical victory for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], it did not alter the course of the Philippines campaign.\n* '''October 28, 1944''' \u2013 The established of the 9th Constabulary Regiment of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were based at the general headquarters and camp base in [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]] among the provincial companies in Leyte and Samar, constabulary battalions, infantry battalions and military-police battalions. Replaced by PC 9th Samar Company was fought by the Japanese. \n* '''1944''' to '''1945''' \u2014 Combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth military forces, including recognized guerrillas, liberated the province of Samar and defeated Imperial Japanese forces. The local Filipino soldiers under the 4th, 9th, 93rd, 95th and 96th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 9th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary, started the battles in Samar and fought against Japanese troops.\n* '''1945''' \u2014 Filipino and Filipino-American soldiers under the [[1st Filipino Infantry Regiment (United States)|1st Filipino Infantry Regiment]] of the United States Army began the Battle of Samar and aided the local Filipino soldiers of the Philippine Commonwealth Army 4th, 9th, 93rd, 95th and 96th Infantry Divisions and the Philippine Constabulary [[9th Constabulary Regiment (Philippine Constabulary)|9th Constabulary Regiment]], the local Samare\u00f1o guerrilla resistance and the U.S. liberation forces defeated the Japanese liberating the province of Samar.\n* '''1965''' \u2014 On June 19, the [[Philippine Congress]] along with the three Samar [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Representatives]], Eladio T.

The province is bordered on the north by [[Northern Samar]], east by [[Eastern Samar]], south by [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] and the [[Leyte Gulf]], and west by the [[Samar Sea]].\n\n===Topography===\nSamar province is hilly, with mountain peaks ranging from {{Convert|200|to|800|m}} high and narrow strips of lowlands, which tend to lie in coastal peripheries or in the [[alluvial plain]]s and [[river delta|delta]]s accompanying large rivers. The largest lowlands are located along the northern coast extending up to the valleys of [[Catubig River|Catubig]] and [[Catarman River|Catarman]] rivers. Smaller lowlands in Samar are to be found in the [[Calbayog]] area and on the deltas and small valleys of Gandara and [[Ulot River|Ulot]] rivers. Slopes are generally steep and barren of trees due to [[deforestation]]. Run-off waters after heavy rains can provoke flooding in low-lying areas and the erosion of the mountains enlarges the coastal plains of the province.\n\n[[File:Ph fil samar.png|thumb]]\n\n===Climate and rainfall===\nAreas near the eastern coast of the province have no dry season (with a pronounced maximum rain period usually occurring from December to January), and are thus open to the northeast [[monsoon]]. Municipalities in the southeastern section of the province experience this type of climate.\n\nAreas located in the northwestern portion of the province have a more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nThe province of Samar comprises two [[Legislative districts of Samar|congressional districts]], 24 [[municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]] and two [[Cities of the Philippines|component cities]]. It has a total of 952 barangays.\n\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#CCFFCC|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

Samar is connected to the [[Leyte|island of Leyte]] via the [[San Juanico Bridge]] (Marcos Bridge).\n\nIn 1768, Leyte and modern Samar was created out of the [[Samar Province (1768-1965)|historical province of Samar]].  In 1965, Northern and Eastern Samar were created.\n\nFishing and agriculture are the major economic activities in the province.<ref>http://www.samar.lgu-ph.com/econo.htm Economical Data</ref>\n\nOn 8 November 2013, the province was significantly damaged by [[Typhoon Haiyan|Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan)]], particularly the towns of [[Basey, Samar|Basey]], [[Marabut, Samar|Marabut]] and [[Santa Rita, Samar|Santa Rita]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Samar'' is said{{by whom|date=May 2017}} to be derived from ''Samad'', the [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] word for \"wound\" or \"cut\", describing the rough physical features of the land which is rugged and deeply dissected by streams.\n\n==History==\n{{prose|date=April 2013}}\n\n* '''2 million-8,000 B.C''' \u2014 Based on geologic findings, during the ice ages or Pleistocene period (2 million years \u2013 8,000 B.C), the islands of Mindoro, Luzon, and Mindanao were connected as one big island through the islands of Samar, Leyte and Bohol.\n* '''8550 B.C.''' \u2014 Diggings in Sohoton Caves in Basey, Samar showed stone flake tools dated 8550 B.C.\n* '''1300''' \u2014 Other diggings along the Basey River revealed other stone flakes used until the 13th century.\n* '''1543''' \u2014 The explorer [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]], first came to the island and named it ''Las Islas Filipinas''.\n* '''1596''' \u2014 Many names (such as ''Samal'', ''Ibabao'', ''Tandaya'') were given to Samar Island prior to the coming of the Spaniards in 1596. The name \"Samar\" was derived from the local language ''samad,'' meaning \"wound\" or \"cut\", aptly describing the rough physical features of the island, rugged and deeply dissected by streams. Recent scholars connect the name Samar to the ancient city of Samaria, the capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel. The early Datu of Samar, Iberein of Lawang Town, in the Northern part of the island may have a Samarian blood.  During the early days of Spanish occupation, Samar was under the jurisdiction of [[Cebu]].\n* '''Arrival of the First Missionaries Jesuits''' \u2014 On October 15, 1596, the first [[Jesuit]] Mission arrived in ''Tinago'' (now [[Dapdap]]) in [[Tarangnan]]. From Tinago, the missionaries Fr. [[Francisco de Otazo]], [[Bartolome Martes]], and [[Domingo Alonzo]] began teaching [[Catechism]] healing the sick and spread the [[Christianity]] faith into the interior settlements.\n* '''1649''' '''to 1650''' \u2014 On June 1, 1649, the people of [[Palapag]] led by [[Agustin Sumuroy]] revolted against the decree of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Diego Fajardo Chac\u00f3n|Diego Fajardo]] requiring able bodied men from the [[Visayas]] for service at the Cavite Shipyards. Like fire, the revolt quickly spread the neighboring town in the Northern and Western coast of Samar and to the nearby provinces of Bicol, [[Surigao (province)|Surigao]], [[Cebu]], [[Camiguin]] and as far as [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga]]. It was suppressed in 1650 by the combined forces of the [[Spaniards]], Lutaos, and Pampangos.\n* '''1735''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were united into one province with [[Carigara]], in Leyte, as the capital town.\n* '''1747''' \u2014 Samar and Leyte were separated for administrative effectiveness.\n* '''1762''' \u2014 Complaints from the Jesuits that the division was not working well, thus it was reunited again by the approval from the King of Spain.\n* '''1768''' \u2014 Jesuits were expelled in all Spanish dominions. The Franciscans arrived on September 25, 1768 and succeeded the administration of 14 parishes which was under by the spiritual care of the Jesuits for almost 172 years. The remaining three parishes of Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey in the south of Samar went under the administration of the Augustinians.\n* '''1777''' \u2014 The two provinces were divided for the last time, it was approved in Madrid in 1786 and had been effective in 1799.\n* '''1803''' \u2014 Guiuan, Balangiga and Basey were turned over to the Franciscans for the lack of Augustinian priests. \n* '''Royal Decree declares Samar as a Province''' \u2014 On August 11, 1841, [[Isabel II of Spain|Queen Isabella II of Spain]] signed a [[Royal Decree]] declaring Samar as a province.\n* '''1900''' \u2014 The [[Siege of Catubig|Battle of Catubig]] (April 15\u201318, 1900) occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. On April 15, 1900, the Filipino guerrillas launched a surprise attack on a detachment of US 43rd Infantry Regiment, forcing the Americans to abandon Catubig town after the four-day siege.\n* '''1901''' \u2014 The [[Balangiga massacre]] occurred during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. September 28, 1901, the people of [[Balangiga, Eastern Samar|Balangiga]], [[Giporlos]], [[Lawaan]] and [[Quinapondan]] in [[Eastern Samar]] surprised and attacked the American forces station there, [[Balangiga massacre|killing 48 American soldiers]]. To avenge their defeat, American general [[Jacob H. Smith]] ordered his men to turn Samar into a \"howling wilderness\".\n* '''1910''' \u2014 On April 10, 1910, upon the papal bull of Pope Pius X separated the islands of Samar and Leyte from the Diocese of Cebu and erected the Diocese of Calbayog comprising both islands. Pablo Singzon de Anuncacion was named first Bishop and consecrated on June 12, 1910.\n* '''1941''' \u2014 The [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)|invasion by the Japanese]] via fighter and bomber planes.\n* '''1941''' to '''1942''' \u2014 Filipino troops of the [[91st Division (Philippines)|91st Infantry Division]], Philippine Commonwealth Army, and [[USAFFE]] (under the Visayan-Mindanao Force) were established, but all fell to the invading Japanese forces.

The province is bordered on the north by [[Northern Samar]], east by [[Eastern Samar]], south by [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] and the [[Leyte Gulf]], and west by the [[Samar Sea]].\n\n===Topography===\nSamar province is hilly, with mountain peaks ranging from {{Convert|200|to|800|m}} high and narrow strips of lowlands, which tend to lie in coastal peripheries or in the [[alluvial plain]]s and [[river delta|delta]]s accompanying large rivers. The largest lowlands are located along the northern coast extending up to the valleys of [[Catubig River|Catubig]] and [[Catarman River|Catarman]] rivers. Smaller lowlands in Samar are to be found in the [[Calbayog]] area and on the deltas and small valleys of Gandara and [[Ulot River|Ulot]] rivers. Slopes are generally steep and barren of trees due to [[deforestation]]. Run-off waters after heavy rains can provoke flooding in low-lying areas and the erosion of the mountains enlarges the coastal plains of the province.\n\n[[File:Ph fil samar.png|thumb]]\n\n===Climate and rainfall===\nAreas near the eastern coast of the province have no dry season (with a pronounced maximum rain period usually occurring from December to January), and are thus open to the northeast [[monsoon]]. Municipalities in the southeastern section of the province experience this type of climate.\n\nAreas located in the northwestern portion of the province have a more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\nThe province of Samar comprises two [[Legislative districts of Samar|congressional districts]], 24 [[municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]] and two [[Cities of the Philippines|component cities]]. It has a total of 952 barangays.\n\n{{unbulleted list\n| {{Color box|#CCFFCC|\u2020|border=darkgray}} {{font|Provincial capital and component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FFE6F3|\u2217|border=darkgray}} {{font|Component city|size=90%}}\n| {{Color box|#FDFDFD|border=darkgray}} {{font|Municipality|size=90%}}\n}}\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background-color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\"\n!

The approach to this work is:\n\n* Publication of a spatial and temporal species distribution atlas for the Costa Rica Thermal Dome. Visualisations of the oceanographic features and ecological attributes, value of the resource and the economic and biological links to [[Central America]] are to be included within the contents.\n* Raised awareness of the value and relevance of biodiversity sustained by the CRTD and the linkages to human wellbeing and the conservation of areas beyond natural jurisdiction applied through an extensive public outreach program as-well as a media campaign.\n* Creation of a multisectoral recommendation for a potential macro-zonation plan for the CRTD, leading to the development of a potential governance model for the CRTD that lies in international waters\n* Promotion of agreed recommendations and governance model amongst decision makers within Central America.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bodies of water of Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Marine biology]]\n[[Category:Ocean currents]]\n\n{{Improve categories|date=July 2019}}\n", "name_user": "PohranicniStraze", "label": "safe", "comment": "sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica_Thermal_Dome"}
