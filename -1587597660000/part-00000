[[Solar energy]] uses the sun\u2019s radiation to generate electricity using photovoltaic arrays. This technology can be mounted to rooftops or buildings in addition to the common solar fields.<ref name=\"Mishra 337\u2013350\">{{Citation|last=Mishra|first=Saurabh|title=Chapter 13 Energy Sustainability and Strategic Communications|date=2016-09-27|work=Energy Security and Sustainability|pages=337\u2013350|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4987-5443-9|last2=Singh|first2=Priyanka|doi=10.1201/9781315368047-14}}</ref> Additionally, solar energy can include the heating of solar collectors to heat water for different functions within the building. Wind energy harnesses the fluctuations of solar heating on the planet that manifests in the form of wind. Using both vertical and horizontal turbines, the gear box uses this energy and generates electricity.<ref name=\"Mishra 337\u2013350\"/>\n\n== Transition to Renewable Energy ==\nTo fully embrace the renewable energy transition, thorough research has been conducted and there are pivotal areas for growth within the industry. Investing in new technology research is imperative in providing answers for the following topics: efficiency, storage and variability. Regarding photovoltaic technology, efficiency plays a part in its capacity to be a part of the transition. With the ideal efficiency rate being 15%, researchers must invest in building the capacity of this technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=John A.|date=1999-07-30|title=A Realizable Renewable Energy Future|journal=Science|language=en|volume=285|issue=5428|pages=687\u2013689|doi=10.1126/science.285.5428.687|issn=0036-8075|pmid=10426982}}</ref> Additionally, energy storage is reliant upon local infrastructure.

Companies have achieved this integration of new technologies before, such as [[\u00d8rsted (company)|\u00d8rsted]] who will have replaced coal with 99% wind energy by 2025.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ccsi.columbia.edu/2019/04/15/lessons-learned-from-an-energy-companys-green-transformation/|title=Lessons Learned From an Energy Company's Green Transformation - Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> Large scale implementation strategies of alternatives are being pursued to escalate the transition around the world.<ref name=\"Owusu\"/>\n\n== Drivers of Renewable Energy Transition ==\nMany factors are driving the increased need and interest in the renewable energy transition. Among the most important drivers are the acknowledgment of the energy system\u2019s impact on climate change, as well as the diminishing resources that threaten [[energy security]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Climate change]] can be attributed to the use of [[Fossil fuel energy|fossil fuel energy]] and the contribution of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This increased level of greenhouse gas emissions creates adverse effects on a changing climate such as increased intensity and frequency of natural disasters.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trenberth|first=Kevin|date=2015|title=Attribution of climate extreme events|url=http://www.theurbanclimatologist.com/uploads/4/4/2/5/44250401/attributionextremeevents.pdf|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=5|issue=8|pages=725\u2013730|via=|doi=10.1038/nclimate2657|bibcode=2015NatCC...5..725T}}</ref> The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] has said with high certainty that society has 12 years to complete an entire transition to avoid catastrophic climate change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/SR15_SPM_version_report_LR.pdf|title=Summary for Policy Makers|last=|first=|date=2019|website=IPCC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This reality has motivated the conversation of a renewable energy transition as a mitigation tactic.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry faces risk completely separate from the impacts of climate change. Fossil fuels are a limited resource and are at risk of reaching a peak in which diminishing returns will become prevalent.<ref name=\"Mishra 337\u2013350\"/> Uncertainty with the supply of this resource questions the security of the industry and the investments in fossil fuel companies. Companies such as Blackrock are evaluating these risks and determining their desire level of involvement with the industry as a result.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter|title=Larry Fink's Letter to CEOs|website=BlackRock|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> These driving conversations are motivating organizations to reconsider the future of the energy sector.\n\n== Technologies ==\n\n=== Wind energy ===\n[[Wind power|Wind energy]] is a viable form of renewable energy, as wind is abundant and inexhaustible. Its use produces no toxic pollution nor greenhouse gas emissions. There is enough wind on Earth and in the atmosphere which could be transformed into energy to easily power the planet- we could capture more than 20 times the 18 terawatts of energy that the global population uses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidescience.org/news/studies-show-wind-powers-massive-potential|title=Studies Show Wind Power's Massive Potential|date=2012-09-10|website=Inside Science|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Wind turbines themselves are very space efficient, as one turbine can generate enough electricity to power 600 U.S. homes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/wind-power/|title=Wind Power|date=2009-10-09|website=National Geographic|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Wind energy is also becoming more affordable, as prices have decreased over 80% since 1980 and are expected to keep decreasing. The operational costs associated with wind power are also low.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/advantages-and-challenges-wind-energy|title=Advantages and Challenges of Wind Energy|website=Energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\nHowever, conflicts can arise concerning land use, as the wind turbines use between 30 and 141 acres per megawatt of power output capacity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Denholm|first=P.|date=2009|title=Land-use requirements of modern wind power plants in the United States|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy09osti/45834.pdf|journal=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Some opponents of wind energy argue that the land could be better used, although the land can still be used for grazing livestock, agriculture, and highways. Another issue regarding wind energy concerns the disturbance to wildlife. Many studies have been done to assess the impact of wind turbines on bird and bat populations, and the disturbance of [[wind turbine]]s has been found to be relatively low and does not pose a threat to species population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.eere.energy.gov/wind/pdfs/birds_and_bats_fact_sheet.pdf|title=Wind turbine interactions with birds, bats, and their habitats: A summary of research results and priority questions|last=|first=|date=2010|website=National Wind Coordinating Committee|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Solar energy ===\n[[File:Solar panels in the desert.jpg|thumb|Photovoltaic array at the Mesa Verde Visitor and Research Center in Montezuma County, Colorado. This site uses 95% renewable energy and is an example of the renewable energy transition occurring.]]\n\nSolar energy is another commonly used renewable energy source. It could provide well over the energy needed to power our world- the surface of the earth receives 120,000 terawatts of solar radiation, which is 20,000 times more power than what is needed to supply the entire world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/maps/solar-energy-potential|title=Solar Energy Potential|website=Energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Solar power can be used to generate electricity in places that lack a grid connection, such as distilling water in Africa, or even to power satellites in space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lightingafrica.org/about/why-off-grid-energy/|title=Benefits of Off-Grid Solar Products|website=Lighting Africa|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> There are no moving parts involved in most applications of solar power, leading to no noise associated with photovoltaic panels. This compares favorable to certain other green-techs such as wind turbines.\n\nUnfortunately, solar energy still comes with a few drawbacks. Similarly to wind energy, land use is a concern. However, solar panels can be placed on rooftops and in this case they do not take up space that could have been used for something more productive. Panels can also be placed at low quality locations such as brownfields, abandoned mining land, or existing transportation and transmission corridors. The manufacturing of solar panels also has some negative impacts. They require a significant amount of water to be produced, but dry-cooling technology can reduce water use at manufacturing plants by approximately 90 percent.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Hand|first=M.M.|date=2012|title=Renewable Electricity Futures Study|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/52409-4.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|volume=4|id=NREL/TP-6A20-52409|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Geothermal energy ===\nGeothermal energy is another type of viable and increasingly common renewable energy source.The process of obtaining this energy is emission free- there is absolutely zero carbon used when it comes to the production of this type of power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/geothermal-faqs|title=Geothermal FAQs|website=Energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> The procedure can clean out sulfur that may have generally been discharged from other processes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://amsainc.com/geothermal/|title=Sulfur deposit cleaning and prevention in geothermal cooling towers in power plants|last=Codeart.mk|website=AMSA, Inc.|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Geothermal energy has the smallest land footprint of any major energy source in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/pros-and-cons-of-geothermal-energy.php|title=Pros and Cons of Geothermal Energy|last=Rinkesh|date=2015-01-19|website=Conserve Energy Future|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\nWater is also used in obtaining this type of energy. Depending on the cooling technology used, geothermal plants can require between 1,700 and 4,000 gallons of water per megawatt-hour of energy produced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.energy.gov/eere/geothermal/how-geothermal-power-plant-works-simple|title=How a Geothermal Power Plant Works (Simple)|website=Energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> However, most geothermal plants can use either geothermal fluid or freshwater for cooling, and using the prior has a significantly lesser environmental impact. There are both open-looped and close-looped geothermal systems, and open-loop systems emit small amounts of hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane, and boron.<ref>{{Cite document|url=|title=A Guide to Geothermal Energy and the Environment|last=Kagel|first=A.|date=2007|website=Geothermal Energy Association|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Hydroelectric energy ===\n[[File:Gold ray dam.jpg|thumb|Gold Ray Dam on the [[Rogue River (Oregon)|Rogue River]] upstream of [[Gold Hill, Oregon|Gold Hill]] in the U.S. state of Oregon. Fish ladder visible on the far bank. The dam, which made fish passage difficult, was removed later in 2010.]]\nHydroelectric power includes both massive hydroelectric dams and small run-of-the-river plants. Hydroelectric plants emit fewer greenhouse gasses than fossil based power sources, which helps mitigate climate change, acid rains, and smog.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/pros-and-cons-of-hydroelectric-power.php|title=Various Pros and Cons of Hydroelectric Power|date=2015-02-17|website=Conserve Energy Future|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Hydroelectric power also improves the air quality we breathe because it does not emit air pollutants, and the plants do not produce toxic byproducts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/hydroelectric-power-advantages-production-and-usage?qt-science_center_objects=0#|title=Hydroelectric Power: Advantages of Production and Usage|website=www.usgs.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> Hydroelectric power plants have an average lifetime of 50 \u2013 100 years, meaning they are strategic investments that can support many future generations.

Flooding land for a hydroelectric reservoir has a significant environmental impact, as it destroys forest, wildlife habitat, agricultural land, and scenic lands.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/land-under-water-estimating-hydropowers-land-use-impacts/|title=Land Under Water: Estimating Hydropower\u2019s Land Use Impacts \u00ab Landsat Science|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> There is also a significant impact on wildlife. Fish and other organisms can be injured and killed by turbine blades.<ref name=\":1\" /> Aside from direct contact, there are also wildlife impacts within the dammed reservoirs and downstream from the facility. Reservoirs will have above average amounts of sediments and nutrients, which can cultivate an excess of algae and lead to [[eutrophication]]. In addition, reservoirs are required to release a certain amount of water every year to prevent rivers downstream from drying up, which would be detrimental to those ecosystems.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Tidal energy ===\nTidal energy utilizes the gravitational and kinetic energy of large bodies of water. The physical push and pull of the tides causes a turbine to spin, and that turbine converts the water's movement into electricity.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.renewableresourcescoalition.org/tidal-energy/|title=Tidal Energy: What is it, Pros & Cons, Future Development {{!}} 2020's Guide|date=2019-12-11|website=Renewable Resources Coalition|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> This form of renewable energy produces no pollution, and takes up little physical space when compared to other forms of renewable energy. It is predictable and reliable form of energy, as most water bodies experience two high tides and two low tides per day. This cycle is easily predicted and isn\u2019t subject to unexpected changes unlike many other renewable resources. Some systems also harvest energy from tidal currents regardless of which direction they are flowing, allowing the production of energy to go completely uninterrupted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/tidal-energy|title=Tidal Energy - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> The equipment used is long lasting, with an average lifespan of 75-100 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.power-technology.com/features/tidal-energy-advantages-and-disadvantages/|title=Tidal energy advantages and disadvantages: key points to consider|date=2018-10-26|website=Power Technology {{!}} Energy News and Market Analysis|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \n\nHowever, some cons do exist. The systems require turbulent water to power them, meaning a large foundation needs to be built, which can result in habitat destruction. The greatest offender is the tidal barrage system which utilizes dams that can impede the movement of sea life and potentially wreak havoc on aquatic ecosystems.<ref name=\":2\" /> Tidal energy systems also have a high upfront cost. Although they have long lifespans and eventually pay themselves off, governments are more concerned with their 5-year budget rather than a 60-year projection.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kempener|first=Ruud|date=2014|title=Tidal Energy Technology Brief|url=https://www.irena.org/documentdownloads/publications/tidal_energy_v4_web.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> \n\n=== Nuclear Energy ===\nThere has been a [[Nuclear power debate|debate]] around whether nuclear energy is considered renewable or not.

The physical push and pull of the tides causes a turbine to spin, and that turbine converts the water's movement into electricity.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.renewableresourcescoalition.org/tidal-energy/|title=Tidal Energy: What is it, Pros & Cons, Future Development {{!}} 2020's Guide|date=2019-12-11|website=Renewable Resources Coalition|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> This form of renewable energy produces no pollution, and takes up little physical space when compared to other forms of renewable energy. It is predictable and reliable form of energy, as most water bodies experience two high tides and two low tides per day. This cycle is easily predicted and isn\u2019t subject to unexpected changes unlike many other renewable resources. Some systems also harvest energy from tidal currents regardless of which direction they are flowing, allowing the production of energy to go completely uninterrupted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/tidal-energy|title=Tidal Energy - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> The equipment used is long lasting, with an average lifespan of 75-100 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.power-technology.com/features/tidal-energy-advantages-and-disadvantages/|title=Tidal energy advantages and disadvantages: key points to consider|date=2018-10-26|website=Power Technology {{!}} Energy News and Market Analysis|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> \n\nHowever, some cons do exist. The systems require turbulent water to power them, meaning a large foundation needs to be built, which can result in habitat destruction. The greatest offender is the tidal barrage system which utilizes dams that can impede the movement of sea life and potentially wreak havoc on aquatic ecosystems.<ref name=\":2\" /> Tidal energy systems also have a high upfront cost.

Businesses that have joined the renewable energy cause do so by relying on business models. The need for business models, when dealing with the economics of the renewable energy transition, are crucial due to the lack of concrete research done in this area. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} These models show projections of marginal costs, efficiency, and demand in different periods of time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bryant|first=Scott T.|last2=Straker|first2=Karla|last3=Wrigley|first3=Cara|date=2019-07-01|title=The discourses of power \u2013 governmental approaches to business models in the renewable energy transition|journal=Energy Policy|language=en|volume=130|pages=41\u201359|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2019.03.050|issn=0301-4215}}</ref> Business models are financial assistants that help guide businesses, companies, and individuals looking to get involved.\n\n=== Global rivalries ===\nGlobal rivalries have contributed to the driving forces of the economics behind the renewable energy transition. Competition to reach ultimate efficiency with renewable energy is motivating countries to improve further and further. Technological innovations developed within a country have the potential to become an economic force.<ref>Scholten, D., Criekemans, D., & de Graaf, T. V. (2020).

When looking for economic benefits behind power systems, savings and costs are crucial topics being addressed. A determinant in addressing the costs and savings of power systems is the alternative routes to [[Greenhouse gas|GHG emissions.]] Egypt introduced a plan to do so by stopping conventional power plants and converting them over to hybrid and wind farm plants.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The results of this were seen to decrease carbon dioxide emissions and save the state up to $14 million dollars.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.egyr.2019.08.006|title = Economic and environmental benefits of increasing the renewable energy sources in the power system|year = 2019|last1 = Nassar|first1 = Ibrahim A.|last2 = Hossam|first2 = Kholoud|last3 = Abdella|first3 = Mahmoud Mohamed|journal = Energy Reports|volume = 5|pages = 1082\u20131088|doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Social Aspects ==\n\n=== Influences ===\nTo gather a realistic understanding of the renewable energy transition, influences should be analyzed to understand the scope of the environment and conversation surrounding the transition. One of these influences is that of the oil industry. The oil industry controls the large majority of the world's energy supply and needs as it is the most accessible and available resource we have today.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} With a history of continued success and sustained demand, the oil industry has become a stable aspect of society, the economy and the energy sector.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To transition to renewable energy technologies, our government and economy must address the oil industry and its control of the energy sector.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lenferna|first=Alex|date=2018-11-22|title=Divest\u2013Invest: A Moral Case for Fossil Fuel Divestment|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|doi=10.1093/oso/9780198813248.003.0008}}</ref>\n\nOne way that oil companies are able to continue their work despite growing environmental, social and economic concerns is through lobbying efforts within local and national government systems.

From 1988 to 2005, [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]], one of the largest oil companies in the world, spent nearly $16 million in anti-climate change lobbying and providing misleading information about climate change to the general public.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frumhoff|first=Peter C.|last2=Heede|first2=Richard|last3=Oreskes|first3=Naomi|date=2015-07-23|title=The climate responsibilities of industrial carbon producers|journal=Climatic Change|volume=132|issue=2|pages=157\u2013171|doi=10.1007/s10584-015-1472-5|bibcode=2015ClCh..132..157F|issn=0165-0009|doi-access=free}}</ref> It is examples such as these, that show the significance of the oil industry as stakeholders within the government. In order for the renewable energy transition to succeed, the oil lobbying should be addressed and met with a strong economic, social and environmental case. The oil industry acquires lots of support through our banking and investment structure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The stabile nature of oil stock throughout history makes it a great option for investors. By investing in the fossil fuel industry, we provide them with financial support to continue with their business ventures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rimmer|first=Matthew|date=2018|title=Divest New York: The City of New York, C40, Fossil Fuel Divestment, and Climate Litigation|journal=SSRN Working Paper Series|doi=10.2139/ssrn.3379421|issn=1556-5068}}</ref> The concept that we should no longer support the industry financially has led to the social movement known as divestment.

The two states had been at war since 264 BC, fighting mostly on the island of Sicily or in the waters around it, with the Romans slowly pushing the Carthaginians back. By 250 BC, the Carthaginians held only two cities on Sicily: Lilybaeum and [[Drepana]]; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.\n\nIn mid-250 the Romans besieged Lilybaeum with more than 100,000 men. They made a concerted effort to take Lilybaeum by assault, but were unsuccessful and the siege became a stalemate. The Romans then attempted to destroy the Carthaginian fleet, but their fleet was itself destroyed in the naval [[battle of Drepana|Battles of Drepana]] and [[Battle of Phintias|Phintias]]. The Carthaginians subsequently proved able to supply the city from the sea. Nine years later, in 242 BC, the Romans built a new fleet and cut off supplies. The Carthaginians reconstituted their fleet and despatched it to Sicily loaded with supplies.

The remaining Roman consul, [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (consul 251 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]] sent out skirmishers to harass the Carthaginians, keeping them constantly supplied with javelins from stocks within the city. The ground was covered with [[earthworks (military)|earthworks]] constructed during the Roman siege, making it difficult for the elephants to advance. Peppered with missiles and unable to retaliate, the elephants fled through the Carthaginian infantry behind them. Metallus had opportunistically moved a large force to the Carthaginian's left flank, and they charged into their disordered opponents. The Carthaginians fled; Metallus captured the elephants but did not permit a pursuit.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=82\u201383}} Contemporary accounts do not report either side's losses, and modern historians consider later claims of 20,000\u201330,000 Carthaginian casualties improbable.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n== Siege ==\n[[File:Reconstruction of Lilybaeum (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.5|{{center|A reconstruction of a possible layout of Lilybaeum and its defences at the time of the siege.

The Carthaginian garrison consisted of 7,000 infantry and 700 cavalry, under the command of [[Himilco (Lilybaeum)|Himilco]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=84}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=94}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=190}}\n\nLilybaeum was the main Carthaginian base on Sicily, and in the opinion of the historian John Lazenby, its loss would have ended their presence on the island.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=124}} It had very strong walls and numerous towers, which were defended by a dry [[moat]] which Diodoros reports as being {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=1|order=flip| adj=mid | -deep }} and {{convert|90|ft|m|sigfig=1|order=flip| adj=mid | -wide }}.

The ditch was filled and six of the towers of the outer wall were demolished. The Romans attempted to [[Tunnel warfare|mine]] Lilybaeum's defences, and the defenders dug counter-mines. The defenders also endeavoured to repair the damage to the walls and towers each night and repeatedly sortied against the Roman [[siege]]works. Polybius wrote of fighting so fierce that there were as many casualties as in a [[pitched battle]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=127}} The Romans also lost men to exposure, disease and poor food; including rancid meat.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=94}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=131}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=84}}\n\nCarthaginian citizens played a limited role in their army, most of the rank and file were foreigners. Roman sources refer to these foreign fighters derogatively as \"[[Mercenary|mercenaries]]\"{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=323\u20133}} Their loyalty to Carthage was usually strong, but with their morale lowered by the fierce Roman assault, several senior officers slipped out one night to the Roman camp, intending to betraying the city. They were in turn betrayed to Himilco by a [[ancient Greece|Greek]] officer called [[Alexon]]. Hamilco prevented the [[turncoat]]s from returning to the city and rallied their troops by personal exhortation and promising a monetary bonus.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=84}} As the Roman onslaught reached a peak, 50 Carthaginian warships gathered off the [[Aegates Islands]], which lie {{convert|15|-|40|km|0}} to the west of Sicily. Once there was a strong west wind, they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. The Roman navy did not pursue them into the harbour because of the shoals. The ships unloaded a large quantity of supplies and reinforcements; either 4,000 or 10,000 men according to different sources. They evaded the Romans by leaving at night, evacuating the Carthaginian cavalry to the north where the Carthaginian commander of Drepana, [[Adherbal (admiral)|Adherbal]], still had some freedom of manoeuvre.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=560}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=160}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=85}} The same night Himilco launched a major sally with most of the garrison, including the reinforcements, in an attempt to destroy the Roman siegeworks. After a fight which Lazenby describes as \"confused and desperate\", they were forced to withdraw without success.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=128}}\n\nThe Romans sank 15 ships laden with rocks in the approaches to the harbour in an attempt to block it, but to no avail.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=127}} They then made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber [[Boom (navigational barrier)|boom]], but due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=84\u201386}} The Carthaginian garrison was kept supplied by [[blockade runner]]s, light and manoeuvrable [[galley]]s with highly trained crews and experienced pilots. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by [[Hannibal the Rhodian]], who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually, the Romans captured Hannibal and his ship.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nThe Roman assault continued. The Romans broke down part of the wall using catapults. The defenders built an inner wall. Filling the ditch in several places, the Romans distracted the Carthaginians with a feint at one part of the wall, and then seized a different section of it with a separate attack. By means which are unclear in the sources, possibly by tempting them further into the city, Himilco destroyed them and recaptured the wall. A gale set in from the south west, which blew away the sheds protecting the besiegers' rams from having rocks and inflammatories dropped on them and damaged or destroyed their siege towers. Taking advantage of this, the garrison sortied and started fires in three places. With the wind fanning the flames, they spread rapidly and the Romans attempting to dowse them and to repel the Carthaginians were hampered by having smoke and flames in their faces. The siegeworks were substantially destroyed.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=130\u2013131}}\n\nAfter the destruction of their siegeworks, the Romans constructed strong earth and timber walls to prevent further sorties, but which would also greatly hamper any further assaults on the city.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=131}} The focus of the fighting moved to the north. In 247 BC the new Carthaginian commander on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca]],{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar Barca was the father of [[Hannibal]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=165}}|group=note}} established a base at Hertce, near Panormus and harassed the Roman [[Line of communication|lines of communication]] for three years. He then redeployed to [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], near Drepana, from where he employed [[combined arms]] tactics in a [[Fabian strategy]]. This [[guerrilla warfare]] kept the Roman legions pinned down and preserved Carthage's foothold in Sicily.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=144}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=95}}\n\n===Naval clashes===\n[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting two figures dressed as Roman legionaries|{{center|Detail from the [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus|Ahenobarbus relief]] showing two Roman foot-soldiers from the second century BC}}]]\n\nThe Romans made no further serious attempts to capture Lilybaeum by force, but settled back to starve out its defenders.{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=160}} To do so, they needed to cut its maritime supply line. In 249 BC one of the consuls, [[Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul 249 BC)|Publius Claudius Pulcher]] decided this could be done by attacking the Carthaginian fleet, which was in the harbour of Drepana, {{convert|25|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} up the coast. The Roman fleet sailed by night to carry out a surprise attack, but became scattered in the dark. The Carthaginian commander Adherbal was able to lead his fleet out of harbour before they were trapped there and counter-attacked in the [[Battle of Drepana]]. The Romans were pinned against the shore and after a hard day's fighting were heavily defeated by the more manoeuvrable Carthaginian ships with their better-trained crews. It was Carthage's greatest naval victory of the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=117\u2013121}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=562}}\n\nShortly after the battle, Adherbal was reinforced by another Carthaginian commander, [[Carthalo (admiral)|Carthalo]], with 70 ships.{{#tag:ref|Two modern historians have speculated that Pulcher may have been aware of this impending reinforcement and that, if so, it was a decisive factor in his decision to attack while his opponent was weaker.{{sfn|Konrad|2015|p=200 n.30}}{{sfn|Tarn|1907|pp=48\u201360}}|group=note}} Adherbal brought Carthalo's command up to 100 ships and sent him to raid Lilybaeum, where he burnt several Roman ships.

The two states had been at war since 264 BC, fighting mostly on the island of Sicily or in the waters around it, with the Romans slowly pushing the Carthaginians back. By 250 BC, the Carthaginians held only two cities on Sicily: Lilybaeum and [[Drepana]]; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere. \n\nIn mid-250 the Romans besieged Lilybaeum with more than 100,000 men. They made a concerted effort to take Lilybaeum by assault, but were unsuccessful and the siege became a stalemate. The Romans then attempted to destroy the Carthaginian fleet, but their fleet was itself destroyed in the naval [[battle of Drepana|Battles of Drepana]] and [[Battle of Phintias|Phintias]]. The Carthaginians subsequently proved able to supply the city from the sea. Nine years later, in 242 BC, the Romans built a new fleet and cut off supplies. The Carthaginians reconstituted their fleet and despatched it to Sicily loaded with supplies. The Romans met it not far from Lilybaeum and decisively defeated it at the [[Battle of the Aegates]] in 241 BC. The Carthaginians [[sue for peace|sued for peace]] and the war ended after 23 years with a Roman victory. By the terms of the resulting [[Treaty of Lutatius]], Carthage had to withdraw its forces from Lilybaeum and the rest of Sicily. \n\n==Sources==\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}}118 BC), a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on [[military tactics]],{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the siege.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n[[File:First Punic War 264 BC v2.png|left|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=A map of the western Mediterranean showing the territory controlled by Carthage and Rome at the start of the First Punic War.|{{center|Territory controlled by Rome and Carthage at the start of the [[First Punic War]]}}]]\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually also take into account the histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}} Since 2010 a number of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] have been recovered from the nearby site of the [[Battle of the Aegates]], the final battle of the war.

The remaining Roman consul, [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (consul 251 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]] sent out skirmishers to harass the Carthaginians, keeping them constantly supplied with javelins from stocks within the city. The ground was covered with [[earthworks (military)|earthworks]] constructed during the Roman siege, making it difficult for the elephants to advance. Peppered with missiles and unable to retaliate, the elephants fled through the Carthaginian infantry behind them. Metallus had opportunistically moved a large force to the Carthaginian's left flank, and they charged into their disordered opponents. The Carthaginians fled; Metallus captured the elephants but did not permit a pursuit.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=82\u201383}} Contemporary accounts do not report either side's losses, and modern historians consider later claims of 20,000\u201330,000 Carthaginian casualties improbable.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n== Siege ==\n[[File:Reconstruction of Lilybaeum (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.5|{{center|A reconstruction of a possible layout of Lilybaeum and its defences at the time of the siege.

The Carthaginian garrison consisted of 7,000 infantry and 700 cavalry, under the command of [[Himilco (Lilybaeum)|Himilco]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=84}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=94}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=190}} \n\nLilybaeum was the main Carthaginian base on Sicily, and in the opinion of the historian John Lazenby, its loss would have ended their presence on the island.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=124}} It had very strong walls and numerous towers, which were defended by a dry [[moat]] which Diodoros reports as being {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=1|order=flip| adj=mid | -deep }} and {{convert|90|ft|m|sigfig=1|order=flip| adj=mid | -wide }}.

The ditch was filled and six of the towers of the outer wall were demolished. The Romans attempted to [[Tunnel warfare|mine]] Lilybaeum's defences, and the defenders dug counter-mines. The defenders also endeavoured to repair the damage to the walls and towers each night and repeatedly sortied against the Roman [[siege]]works. Polybius wrote of fighting so fierce that there were as many casualties as in a [[pitched battle]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=127}} The Romans also lost men to exposure, disease and poor food; including rancid meat.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=94}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=131}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=84}}\n\nCarthaginian citizens played a limited role in their army, most of the rank and file were foreigners.

They were in turn betrayed to Himilco by a [[ancient Greece|Greek]] officer called [[Alexon]]. Hamilco prevented the [[turncoat]]s from returning to the city and rallied their troops by personal exhortation and promising a monetary bonus.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=84}} As the Roman onslaught reached a peak, 50 Carthaginian warships gathered off the [[Aegates Islands]], which lie {{convert|15|-|40|km|0}} to the west of Sicily. Once there was a strong west wind, they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. The Roman navy did not pursue them into the harbour because of the shoals. The ships unloaded a large quantity of supplies and reinforcements; either 4,000 or 10,000 men according to different sources. They evaded the Romans by leaving at night, evacuating the Carthaginian cavalry to the north where the Carthaginian commander of Drepana, [[Adherbal (admiral)|Adherbal]], still had some freedom of manoeuvre.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=560}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=160}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=85}} The same night Himilco launched a major sally with most of the garrison, including the reinforcements, in an attempt to destroy the Roman siegeworks. After a fight which Lazenby describes as \"confused and desperate\", they were forced to withdraw without success.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=128}}\n\nThe Romans sank 15 ships laden with rocks in the approaches to the harbour in an attempt to block it, but to no avail.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=127}} They then made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber [[Boom (navigational barrier)|boom]], but due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=84\u201386}} The Carthaginian garrison was kept supplied by [[Blockade runner|blockade runners]], light and manoeuvrable [[Galley|galleys]] with highly trained crews and experienced pilots. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by [[Hannibal the Rhodian]], who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually, the Romans captured Hannibal and his ship.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nThe Roman assault continued. The Romans broke down part of the wall using catapults. The defenders built an inner wall. Filling the ditch in several places, the Romans distracted the Carthaginians with a feint at one part of the wall, and then seized a different section of it with a separate attack. By means which are unclear in the sources, possibly by tempting them further into the city, Himilco destroyed them and recaptured the wall. A gale set in from the south west, which blew away the sheds protecting the besiegers' rams from having rocks and inflammatories dropped on them and damaged or destroyed their siege towers. Taking advantage of this, the garrison sortied and started fires in three places. With the wind fanning the flames, they spread rapidly and the Romans attempting to dowse them and to repel the Carthaginians were hampered by having smoke and flames in their faces. The siegeworks were substantially destroyed.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=130\u2013131}}\n\nAfter the destruction of their siegeworks, the Romans constructed strong earth and timber walls to prevent further sorties, but which would also greatly hamper any further assaults on the city.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=131}} The focus of the fighting moved to the north. In 247 BC the new Carthaginian commander on Sicily, [[Hamilcar Barca]],{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar Barca was the father of [[Hannibal]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=165}}|group=note}} established a base at Hertce, near Panormus and harassed the Roman [[Line of communication|lines of communication]] for three years. He then redeployed to [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], near Drepana, from where he employed [[combined arms]] tactics in a [[Fabian strategy]]. This [[guerrilla warfare]] kept the Roman legions pinned down and preserved Carthage's foothold in Sicily.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=144}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=95}}\n\n===Naval clashes===\n[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting two figures dressed as Roman legionaires|{{center|Detail from the [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus|Ahenobarbus relief]] showing two Roman foot-soldiers from the second century BC}}]]\n\nThe Romans made no further serious attempts to capture Lilybaeum by force, but settled back to starve out its defenders.{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=160}} To do so, they needed to cut its maritime supply line. In 249 BC one of the consuls, [[Publius Claudius Pulcher (consul 249 BC)|Publius Claudius Pulcher]] decided this could be done by attacking the Carthaginian fleet, which was in the harbour of Drepana, {{convert|25|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} up the coast. The Roman fleet sailed by night to carry out a surprise attack, but became scattered in the dark. The Carthaginian commander Adherbal was able to lead his fleet out of harbour before they were trapped there and counter-attacked in the [[Battle of Drepana]]. The Romans were pinned against the shore and after a hard day's fighting were heavily defeated by the more manoeuvrable Carthaginian ships with their better-trained crews. It was Carthage's greatest naval victory of the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=117\u2013121}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=562}}\n\nShortly after the battle, Adherbal was reinforced by another Carthaginian commander, [[Carthalo (admiral)|Carthalo]], with 70 ships.{{#tag:ref|Two modern historians have speculated that Pulcher may have been aware of this impending reinforcement and that, if so, it was a decisive factor in his decision to attack while his opponent was weaker.{{sfn|Konrad|2015|p=200 n.30}}{{sfn|Tarn|1907|pp=48\u201360}}|group=note}} Adherbal brought Carthalo's command up to 100 ships and sent him to raid Lilybaeum, where he burnt several Roman ships. A little later, he [[Battle of Phintias|harried a Roman supply convoy]] of 800 transports, escorted by 120 warships, to such effect that it was caught by a storm which sank all the vessels except for two.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=88\u201391}} It was to be seven years before Rome again attempted to field a substantial fleet, while Carthage put most of its ships into reserve to save money and free up manpower.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=121\u2013122}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=163}} Inconsequential fighting continued over the following eight years around Panormus and Eryx.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=122}} Hostilities between Roman and Carthaginian forces declined to small-scale land operations, which suited the Carthaginian strategy.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=95}}\n\nAfter more than 20 years of war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted.{{sfn|Bringmann|2007|p=127}} Evidence of Carthage's financial situation includes their request for a 2,000-[[Talent (measurement)|talent]] loan{{#tag:ref|2,000 talents was approximately {{convert|51|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=in|lk=out}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], which was refused.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=92}} Rome was also close to [[Sovereign default|bankruptcy]] and the number of adult male citizens, who provided the manpower for the navy and the legions, had declined by 17 percent since the start of the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=91}} The historian Adrian Goldsworthy describes Roman manpower losses as \"appalling\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=131}}\n[[File:Q.

The result was a fleet of approximately 200 large warships, built, equipped, and crewed without state expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}} The Romans modelled the ships of their new fleet on a captured blockade runner with especially good qualities, possibly Hannibal the Rhodian's.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} By now, the Romans were experienced at shipbuilding, and with a proven vessel as a model produced high-quality ships.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} Importantly, the Romans changed their tactics,{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} from ones based on boarding their opponents' ships to ones based on outmanoeuvring and [[naval ram|ramming]] them.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=150}}{{sfn|Casson|1991|p=150}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}\n\nThe Carthaginians raised a fleet slightly larger than the Romans', which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It would then embark much of the Carthaginian army stationed there to use as marines. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet under [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] and [[Quintus Valerius Falto]], and in the hard-fought Battle of the Aegates, the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}} After this decisive victory, the Romans continued their land operations in Sicily against Lilybaeum.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=125\u2013126}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nThe Carthaginian Senate was reluctant to allocate the resources necessary to have another fleet built and manned.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} Carthage had taken nine months to fit out the fleet that was defeated, and if they took another nine months to ready another fleet, the Sicilian cities still holding out would run out of supplies and [[Suing for peace|request terms of peace]]. Strategically, Carthage would have to build a fleet capable of defeating the Roman fleet, and then raise an army capable of defeating the Roman forces on Sicily. Instead, the Carthaginian Senate ordered Hamilcar to negotiate a peace treaty with the Romans; he left Sicily in a rage, convinced that the surrender was unnecessary. The next most senior Carthaginian commander on Sicily, [[Gisco (died 239 BC)|Gisco]], the governor of Lilybaeum, agreed the peace terms with the Romans.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=200}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed in the same year as the Battle of the Aegates and brought the First Punic War to its end;

As with the Burns series that came before it, each model has several versions with different factory specifications to suit specific budgets and skill levels. The first generation (MP3/MP4), now referred to as the \"classic Inferno\", was produced from late 1991 to the end of 1996 and won every [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR world championship]] during its production run. With 8 [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR]] titles under its belt, the Kyosho Inferno has been the most successful RC car in its scale and deserves the \"fire\" themed brand name which has been in use since the release of the [[Kyosho Burns]] in 1988. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== General history ==\n\n=== Background ===\nThe first generation of Infernos were produced from late 1991 to 1996 and shared only a few parts with its predecessor the [[Kyosho Burns|Kyosho Turbo Burns]]. The Inferno was almost a complete redesign based on experiences in competition to increase performance, durability and ease of maintenance.  Any similarity with the Burns series of cars was lost with the introduction of the Inferno MP5 in 1995 which introduced design <u>characteristics</u> which can still be found in the current MP10 more than 20 years later.   \n\nWith the introduction of the Inferno, [[Kyosho]] also chose to sell partially assembled, entry-level kits and introduced their own line of budget GS engines.\n\nAs with the Burns predecessor, it was possible to start with the most affordable car and upgrade to a full option, competition-ready vehicle when the skill and budget allowed. Alternatively one could also buy a competition car for far less than the cost of the individual optional parts.\n\nIt is often not known that the MP (Model Project) nomenclature, which is synonymous with Kyosho buggies from the MP5 onward, was already in use at [[Kyosho]] for the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]] and first Inferno series of cars. Burns MP1, Turbo Burns MP2, Inferno MP3, Turbo Inferno MP4.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\"<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic.rc-junkies.net/?p=549|title=Kyosho Landmax history|website=www.classic.rc-junkies.net}}</ref> and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001, and then the Inferno MP7.5 chassis until 2008. The ST series is still going strong today although the components used bare little resemblance to the current Inferno buggy. The classic Inferno also had a smaller sibling in 1:10 scale call the Kyosho Inferno 10<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-inferno-10.htm|title=Kyosho Inferno 10 on RCScrapyard|website=www.rcscrapyard.net}}</ref> which in turn lead to other \"mini\" versions of the Inferno in later years. \n\n <div class=\"left\">\n\n=== Timeline<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.neobuggy.net/2016/03/01/yuichi-kanais-kyosho-buggy-history-from-inferno-to-mp9-tki4/|title=Kyosho Inferno History|website=Neobuggy}}</ref>===\n<div class=\"left\">{{#tag:timeline|ImageSize=width:800 height:auto barincrement:20\nPlotArea = left:120 bottom:20 top:0 right:20\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/1991 till:{{#time: m/d/Y }}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\n#Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:3 start:1992\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1992\n\nColors =\n id:Inferno  value:blue      legend:Inferno\n id:DX  value:blue    legend:DX\n id:Turbo    value:blue    legend:Turbo\n id:DXII value:blue   legend:DXII\n id:MP5 value:gray(0.8)   legend:MP5\n id:MP5EVO1 value:gray(0.8)   legend:MP5EVO1\n id:MP5EVO2 value:gray(0.8)  legend:MP5EVO2\n id:MP6 value:red  legend:MP6\n id:MP6sport value:red  legend:MP6sport\n id:MP6Int value:red  legend:MP6Int\n id:MP75 value:green  legend:MP75\n id:MP75K1 value:green  legend:MP75K1\n id:MP75K2 value:green  legend:MP75K2\n id:MP75sports value:green  legend:MP75sports\n id:MP75K3 value:green  legend:MP75K3\n id:MP777 value:orange  legend:MP777\n id:MP777SP1 value:orange  legend:MP777SP1\n id:MP777SP2 value:orange  legend:MP777SP2\n id:MP777WC value:orange  legend:MP777WC\n id:MP9 value:gray(0.6)  legend:MP9\n id:MP9TKI2 value:gray(0.6)  legend:MP9TKI2\n id:MP9TKI3 value:gray(0.6)  legend:MP9TKI3\n id:MP9TKI4 value:gray(0.6)  legend:MP9TKI4\n id:MP10 value:purple  legend:MP10\n\nBarData =\n bar:Inferno text:\"Inferno 4WD (MP3)\"\n bar:DX text:\"Inferno DX (MP3)\"\n bar:Turbo  text:\"Turbo Inferno (MP4)\"\n bar:DXII text:\"Inferno DX II (MP3)\"\n bar:MP5 text:\"MP5\"\n bar:MP5EVO1 text:\"MP5 EVO 1\"\n bar:MP5EVO2 text:\"MP5 EVO 2\"\n bar:MP6 text:\"MP6\"\n bar:MP6sport text:\"MP6 Sport\"\n bar:MP6Int text:\"MP6 International\"\n bar:MP75 text:\"MP 7.5\"\n bar:MP75K1 text:\"MP 7.5 Kanai 1\"\n bar:MP75K2 text:\"MP 7.5 Kanai 2\"\n bar:MP75sports text:\"MP 7.5 Sports v1-v4\"\n bar:MP75K3 text:\"MP 7.5 Kanai 3\"\n bar:MP777 text:\"MP 777\"\n bar:MP777SP1 text:\"MP 777 SP1\"\n bar:MP777SP2 text:\"MP 777 SP2\"\n bar:MP777WC text:\"MP 777 SP2 WC\"\n bar:MP9 text:\"MP 9\"\n bar:MP9TKI2 text:\"MP 9 TKI2\"\n bar:MP9TKI3 text:\"MP 9 TKI3\"\n bar:MP9TKI4 text:\"MP 9 TKI4\"\n bar:MP10 text:\"MP 10\"\n\nPlotData=\n width:11\n bar:Inferno from:10/01/1991 till:10/01/1993      color:Inferno\n bar:DX from:01/01/1992 till:04/12/1994 color:DX\n bar:Turbo  from:04/02/1994 till:04/12/1995       color:Turbo\n bar:DXII from:01/01/1995 till:12/12/1996 color:DXII\n bar:MP5 from:01/01/1995 till:01/12/1998 color:MP5\n bar:MP5EVO1 from:01/01/1996 till:01/12/1997 color:MP5EVO1\n bar:MP5EVO2 from:01/01/1997 till:01/12/1998 color:MP5EVO2\n bar:MP6 from:01/01/1998 till:12/12/2001 color:MP6\n bar:MP6sport from:12/01/1999 till:12/12/2002 color:MP6sport\n bar:MP6Int from:12/01/1998 till:12/12/2001 color:MP6Int\n bar:MP75 from:12/01/2000 till:12/12/2004 color:MP75\n bar:MP75k1 from:12/10/2000 till:12/12/2001 color:MP75k1\n bar:MP75k2 from:12/12/2001 till:12/12/2002 color:MP75k2\n bar:MP75sports from:12/12/2001 till:12/12/2009 color:MP75sports\n bar:MP75k3 from:12/12/2002 till:12/12/2004 color:MP75k3\n bar:MP777 from:12/10/2004 till:12/12/2008 color:MP777\n bar:MP777SP1 from:12/10/2004 till:12/12/2005 color:MP777SP1\n bar:MP777SP2 from:12/12/2005 till:12/12/2006 color:MP777SP2\n bar:MP777WC from:12/12/2006 till:12/12/2008 color:MP777WC\n bar:MP9 from:12/10/2008 till:12/12/2010 color:MP9\n bar:MP9TKI2 from:12/10/2010 till:12/12/2012 color:MP9TKI2\n bar:MP9TKI3 from:12/10/2012 till:01/12/2016 color:MP9TKI3\n bar:MP9TKI4 from:01/01/2016 till:12/30/2018 color:MP9TKI4\n bar:MP10 from:01/01/2019 till:end color:MP10}}</div></div>\n\n== Classic Inferno (late 1991\u20131996) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nAs with its predecessor, Kyosho released an intermediate-level car first which contained several performance parts.  Not long after, this would be followed by a more affordable \"DX\" version and then a high performance \"Turbo\" version.  The cars were typically released in kit form; however, Kyosho chose to release \"DX\" entry-level models partially assembled, making the car more attractive for customers who were completely new to the hobby.  Depending on the country of release, the DX models would also include Kyosho's own GS engine, which was already set up and ready to run. This further reduced the complexity and made an otherwise highly technical hobby more approachable for a larger audience.  \n\nThe success of this approach can be seen in the extent to which budget DX cars, that are available second hand, have been upgraded by their owners over time as they gained skill and confidence in the hobby. The Inferno's popularity also spawned a large number of 3rd party suppliers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rc10talk.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=42144&start=105|title=3rd party optional parts for the classic Kyosho Inferno|website=www.rc10talk.com}}</ref> that provided additional performance accessories such as brake discs, carbon fiber plates etc. Original Kyosho parts for these cars were still mostly given the \"BS\" and \"BSW\" nomenclature from the Burns series of cars and were also partially compatible with them. Later models received part numbers starting with IF and IFW.   \n\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\"<ref name=\":10\" /> and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001 and the original ST until 2005<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-inferno-st.htm|title=Kyosho Inferno ST on RC Scrapyard|website=www.rcscrapyard.net}}</ref>, nearly a decade after the production of the classic Inferno buggy ended.    \n\nAfter winning every world championship during its production run, the classic Inferno was phased out in favor of the MP5 in 1995. \n\n==== Inferno 4WD, item no. 3281 (late 1991 \u2013 late 1993) ====\nAs the successor to the Turbo Burns, the classic Inferno not only had a couple of the same parts, but also had a similar body design and countersunk chassis plate. The similarities were largely superficial however with only the following parts being interchangeable with its predecessor. \n* Differentials (however Burns had 2 bevel gears, classic and Turbo Inferno had 4, see comparison table below)<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* Wing and wing mount \n* Shock absorbers \n* Wishbones, hubs and axles\n* Fuel tank \n* Engine mount \n* Most screws, nuts, washers, etc. \nThe car introduced many new design elements and notable improvements which would largely continue in subsequent Inferno models \n* Single radio tray which held all electrical components and could be switched quickly as one unit when desired. (Burns radio tray did not hold the throttle servo)  \n* Stronger shock mounts with more mounting options \n* Differentials with 4 bevel gears (Burns had 2)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/148807212@N06/37470601544/in/photostream/#|title=Kyosho Differential Comparison|website=Flickr}}</ref> \n* Two part diff housings for faster maintenance (Burns diff. housing consisted of 5 parts)\n* New wheels and tires \n** Wide at front and back (Burns had narrow wheels and tires at front with the exception of the limited edition Turbo Burns SCC)\n** Micro spike tires instead of regular spikes\n** Lighter wheels with narrower spokes\n* Separate front and rear disc brake (This was an optional part for the Burns towards the end of its production run and was supplied with the limited edition [[Kyosho Burns|Turbo Burns SCC]]. The Inferno brake setup is not compatible with the Burns series.)\n\n==== Inferno DX; item no. 3290h (1992\u20131994) ====\nJust like the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]], the \"DX\" referred to the entry-level specification car. Unlike the Burns, however, this DX came partially assembled and some metal parts such as the exhaust and shock absorbers were replaced with plastic parts. An overview of the differences can be seen in the table below. The BS121 ring and pinion gears were made from a cheaper alloy material instead of the steel gears which were found in the Classic and Turbo versions of the car<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nUnlike the Inferno 4WD und Turbo Inferno, the chassis of the car had additional holes to mount the Kyosho GS21-CR series engine. This particular engine is recognizable by its heat-sink which has vertical instead of the more common horizontal fins<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/c20xB4|title=Kyosho .21 GS21-RC Head|website=Flickr}}</ref>. An interesting cost saving measure was also the lack of countersunk holes in the chassis which would have required an extra production step. This had not been seen since the original Burns.\n\n==== Turbo Inferno; item no. 31346 (1994\u20131995) ====\nContinuing the model naming of the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]], the first series of Inferno cars also used the name \"Turbo\" to signify the car with the largest number of performance parts. Visually the Turbo Inferno could easily be identified by the anodized blue chassis plate and larger capacity, blue shock absorbers. Interestingly Kyosho did not include the blue anodized plates which were mounted in the steering and center differential of the Inferno DXII which was released the following year. The Turbo Inferno also included newly designed green wheels, a green spoiler, and unique \"high grip\" tires (part W5646H) which were supplied from the factory. Other than that the car was very similar in specification to the Inferno 4WD as can be seen in the comparison table below. The new, rigid plastic spoiler was the first departure from the Lexan versions which had been used until that point and would remain standard equipment on all future Inferno models.\n\n==== Inferno DX II Ltd.; item no. 31552 (1995\u20131996) ====\nThe DXII used pieces from the initial classic Inferno 4WD, first Inferno DX and Turbo Burns. Most notable differences from the first DX were: \n* The plastic shock absorbers were replaced with those from the classic Inferno 4WD (same type as Turbo Burns)\n* The metal bearings were replaced with the ball bearings from the classic Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno\n* The plastic muffler and rubber manifold were replaced with the Aluminum tuned muffler and manifold from the older Turbo Burns\n* The Lexan wing was replaced with the hard plastic wing of the Turbo Inferno, however in the same yellow of the wheels instead of the Turbo's green. Although the part number of the wing stayed the same (BSW-71KY), Kyosho changed the color to neon yellow after the DXII was discontinued making the original yellow wing one of the hardest parts to find for collectors and restorers.\n\nIn addition the DXII had all blue anodized plates (with the exception of the chassis), and an additional hole in the chassis to accommodate a pull start. Some DXII kits also included the GS21-X engine. This engine had a new, larger head with horizontal fins to compensate for the overheating issues of the previous GS21-CR.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/wf62v7|title=Kyosho GS-21 X|website=Flickr}}</ref> The new head was available in plain aluminum (part 6520-31) and later with a blue anodized head (part 6520-31bl)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/L84349|title=Kyosho GS21 X later model heat sink 6520-31|website=Flickr}}</ref> to match the other blue plates on the car.\n\nAs there was no entry-level \"Sports\" version of the subsequent MP5 model the Inferno DXII remained Kyosho's entry-level car until 1996. Kyosho would not release another entry level 1/8 Buggy until the MP6 Sports in 1999. \n\n==== Overview of main differences between classic Inferno models ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\u00a0\n|'''Part name'''\n|'''Turbo Inferno'''\n|'''Inferno 4WD'''\n|'''Inferno DX'''\n|'''Inferno DXII Limited'''\n|-\n|'''1'''\n|Differential ring gear\n|BS14*\n|BS14*\n|BS121\n|BS121\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|Differential pinion gear\n|BS14*\n|BS14*\n|BS121\n|BS121\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|Differential bevel gear (S)\n|BS37 (2 pairs per  diff)\n|BS37 (2 pairs per  diff)\n|BS37 (1 pair per diff)\n|BS37 (1 pair per diff)\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|Differential bevel gear (L)\n|BSW64\n|BS36\n|BS36\n|BS36\n|-\n|'''5'''\n|Tires\n|W5646H\n|BSW40\n|BSW40\n|BSW40\n|-\n|'''6'''\n|Chassis\n|BS108**** (blue anodized)\n|BS108\n|BS120\n|GT28\n|-\n|'''7'''\n|Ball bearings\n|Full\n|Full\n|Metal Bushings\n|Full\n|-\n|'''8'''\n|Wheels\n|BSW80KG\n|BS105\n|BS105\n|BS105\n|-\n|'''9'''\n|Wing\n|BSW71KG (Plastic)***\n|BSW5 (Lexan)\n|BSW5 (Lexan)\n|BSW71KY (Plastic)***\n|-\n|'''10'''\n|Shocks\n|BSW72 + BSW73\n|BSW27 + BSW28\n|2001 & 2002  plastic\n|BSW27 + BSW28\n|-\n|'''11'''\n|Front Axels\n|BS20 (Universal)**\n|BS20 (Universal)**\n|BS45 (Dog Bones)\n|BS45 (Dog Bones)\n|-\n|'''12'''\n|Center Diff \n|BSW34 (Adjustable)\n|BSW34 (Adjustable)\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|'''13'''\n|Spur gear\n|BS11\n|BS11\n|BS122\n|BS122\n|-\n|'''14'''\n|Stabilizer\n|BS63 + BSW79\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|'''15'''\n|Fuel Tank\n|BS65\n|BS65\n|BS28\n|BS65\n|-\n|'''16'''\n|Exhaust\n| -\n| -\n|BS123\n|BS64\n|-\n|'''17'''\n|Manifold\n| -\n| -\n|BS124\n|BS26\n|-\n|'''18'''\n|Engine\n| -\n| -\n|Kyosho GS21CR (optional)\n|Kyosho GS21X\n|-\n|'''19'''\n|Plate Set\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116 (both blue anodized)\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Depending on the market and year of production the Turbo Infernos and Inferno 4WDs may also have been supplied with BSW-1 and BSW-2 hardened gears from the factory instead of the standard BS-14 set.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rc10talk.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=42144&start=45&sid=ac245d6201ce746288d802c59dd88a5a|title=BSW-1 and BSW-2 gear discussion on RC10Talk|website=RC10Talk}}</ref>\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal joint to IFW62 in the later references.\n\n<nowiki>***</nowiki> Kyosho eventually changed the part numbering of the BSW71 wing to  IFW213.

The later MP5 and MP6 had similar parts which however were <u>not</u> compatible with the classic Inferno. \n\nThe BSW-55 special diff housing and BSW-82 One Way Diff are among the most rare and expensive parts on the second-hand market<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/3Y9921|title=BSW-55, BSW-82 and BSW-19 on Flickr|website=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/148807212@N06/38181097951/in/photostream/|title=BSW-55 & BSW-82 disassembled on Flickr|website=Flickr}}</ref>.\n\nOne of the more common, and frequently discussed optional parts are the hardened BSW-1 and BSW-2 differential gears<ref name=\":4\" />. It is also the only series of infernos that had 3 different specifications of differentials (depending on the country of sale). As can be seen in the table above the budget Inferno DX models used a cheaper alloy gear set (BS-121), while the mid-range Inferno 4WD cars came with the BS-14 from the Burns generation, and the Turbo Inferno was supplied with the BS-14 or the optional BSW-1 and BSW-2 set depending on the country of sale.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Box art and marketing material ===\nThe Inferno series continued the same style of box art and marketing material of its predecessor using mostly studio pictures of assembled and painted models. The only exception was the Turbo Inferno which came in a plane white and green box with a drawn outline of the car on the front<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.retromodelisme.com/voiture/255-1/turbo-inferno-kit-kyosho.html|title=Turbo Inferno Unboxing|website=www.retromodelisme.com}}</ref>. The Inferno and Inferno DX/DXII came with a box which had an integrated handle.\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (1996\u2013) ===\nAs with the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns]], the most collectible of this initial line-up is the Turbo version. This is in part due to its rarity, especially in good condition. Collectors specifically look for cars on which the blue anodized chassis has no damage, as well as unused tires The blue anodized verion of the chassis with part number BS108 was not available as spare part which makes it particularly dificult to find new.<ref name=\":11\" />  The demand and value on the second hand market is however significantly lower than the Turbo Burns which preceded it, with near mint condition cars with box often selling for less than 200 US Dollars. Collectors are also interested in the first DX in its original configuration as these were typically upgraded by their owners over time. Their original [[Kyosho]] engine, plastic shock absorbers and exhaust being discarded for higher performance parts \n\nDue to the low re-sale value and an abundance of spare parts, as well as reproduction parts such as new bodies and decals<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marwanrc.com/main.sc;jsessionid=4EC1D4EC52D4AE3E818C846D4BFFD2A6.p3plqscsfapp003|title=Marwan RC|website=MarwanRC}}</ref>, the Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno are a good choice for entry and intermediate level RC buggy enthusiasts.

The few remaining parts which are still compatible with the previous Burns cars (MP1-MP2) include the 19mm hex wheels (which would later be changed to 17mm on the Inferno 7.5 as a new industry standard), and the fuel tank. A few other parts such as the wing design, shock absorbers and brake discs were carried across from the Turbo Inferno.\n\nThe MP5/MP6 also included some new design features which remain with the current Inferno line up. \n* Upward angle (kick-up) at the front of chassis<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=121580&id=5484|title=Kyosho MP5 Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref>\n* Splash resistant box for receiver and other electronics (instead of being mounted on the radio tray with the servos)\n\nLike its predecessors, the MP3 and MP4 Infernos, the MP5 & MP6 won every [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR]] title during their production run, first in its standard form and later with the EVO editions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.neobuggy.net/2012/11/27/the-world-champions-cars-2010-1986/|title=RC 1:8 Buggy World Championship Winners 1986-2010|website=Neobuggy.net}}</ref> The MP5 and MP6 are visually nearly identical using the same body and wheels, however the MP6 had a longer chassis and wider rear track. Prior to the MP6 this relatively small change was also available on the MP5 in form of a long wheelbase conversion kit. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=53264&sid=5484|title=Kyosho MP5 Long Wheelbase conversion kit|website=TamiyaClub.com}}</ref> \n\n====  MP5, item no. 31551 (1995\u20131998) ====\nAs with the previous Burns and Inferno models Kyosho released an intermediate level car first. Unlike its predecessors, however, no entry level MP5 was produced. \n\nThe MP5 won the world championship in 1996<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-Inferno-mp5.htm|title=MP5 on RCScrapyard|website=RC Scrapyard}}</ref>, and was marketed as a competition buggy with many in-house options being made available within its first year of production. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmagvintage.com/reviews/retro/voitures/tt/musee/kyosho/catalogues/minicataloguemp5/minicataloguemp5.htm|title=MP5 Options Catalog|website=RCMagvintage}}</ref> \n\n==== MP5 With Picco P6B, item no. 31663P (1996) ====\nA standard Inferno MP5 model packed from the factory with a Picco P6B engine, also includes a manifold and muffler.

It was released in 1996 and included a few parts from the options catalog<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=123736&sid=5484|title=MP5 EVO 1 Unboxing and Additional Instruction Manual|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref>. Unlike the standard MP5 which was supplied with the white wheels and wing that were featured on the box art, the EVO1 was supplied with a set of green wheels and a green wing. The car was sold for one year before being replaced by the EVO2.\n\n==== MP5 EVO2, item no. 31781 (1997\u20131998) ====\nThe EVO2 was based closely on the car which won the 1996 World Championship<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=114210|title=Kyosho MP5 EVO2 Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref> Among various options the most noticeable difference to the previous MP5 models was the longer chassis and rear wishbones which were later used for the MP6. The chassis extension was also available as an upgrade package for previous MP5s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marwanrc.com/product.sc?productId=93|title=Example of long wheelbase kit for sale|website=www.marwanrc.om}}</ref> Unlike the previous 2 models, this car was not supplied with wheels or a wing. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== MP6, item no. 31891 (1998\u20132002) ====\nThe MP6 was essentially a standard MP5 with the longer chassis and wishbones used for the MP5 EVOII, and stronger, blue anodized shock towers. In addition to the shock towers, all other Aluminum plates on the MP6 models were also anodized in blue. The unique feature of this \"standard\" MP6 is the gold anodized chassis plate which is highly sought after in good condition.\n\nA special edition was later released featuring the large capacity shocks of the MP6 International<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/71p5ti|title=MP6 Standard special large shock edition|website=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/92W457|title=MP6 Standard, special large shock edition|website=Flickr}}</ref>.\n\n==== MP6 Sport, item no. 31951 (1999\u20132002) ====\nFormerly referred to as the \"DX\" for the Burns and classic Inferno series of cars, the \"Sport\" was the entry-level car for the MP6 range. It had similar specification changes as the Inferno DXII and was also supplied with a Kyosho GS21 engine with a blue head to match the blue theme of the car (part 6520-31bl).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/clubtt/buggys.html|title=MP6 Overview|website=Geocities}}</ref> Kyosho supplied the sport with a 3&nbsp;mm chassis instead of the 2.5&nbsp;mm of the standard MP6<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.offroad-cult.org/Tracktest/Inferno%20MP6%20SPORTS/Kyosho%20MP6%20Sports.htm|title=MP6 Sports review|website=Offroad Cult}}</ref>. This may lead one to believe that this was a stronger version to outlive the driving of a novice driver; however, the 2.5&nbsp;mm was actually made from a harder alloy. As with the \"DX\" cars, it was possible to upgrade this car to a standard or international version but at a significantly greater cost than if one had bought the international kit directly.\n\n==== MP6 International, item no. 31892 (1998\u20132002) ====\nThe term MP6 \"International\" was used instead of the \"EVO\" nomenclature used to describe performance versions of the MP5 series. The word \"International\" would not be used in this context again but would reappear from the MP9 TKI2 to TKI4, with the \"TKI\" standing for \"Team Kyosho International\". Unlike the MP5 EVO which only had a selection of optional parts, the MP6 featured almost every available option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=48595|title=Kyosho MP6 International Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref> As most of these options were already available for the MP5, the MP6 International could be released only one year after sales for the standard MP6 started.\n\n==== Overview of main differences between MP5 & MP6 models ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\u00a0\n|'''Part name'''\n|'''MP5'''\n|'''MP5 EVO1'''\n|'''MP5 EVO2'''\n|'''MP6'''\n|'''MP6 Sport'''\n|'''MP6 International'''\n|-\n|1\n|Ball  bearings\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|-\n|2\n|Brakes\n|IF-28\n|IF-28\n|IF-28\n|IFW-53\n|IF-28\n|IFW-53 but with double disc\n|-\n|3\n|Center  Shaft front\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-12 (universal)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-12 (universal)\n|-\n|4\n|Center  Shaft rear\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IFW-45 (universal)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-45 (universal)\n|-\n|5\n|Chassis\n|IF-4 (2,5mm)\n|IF-4 (2,5mm)\n|IFW-41 (3mm counter sunk)\n|IF-44 (2,5mm, Gold)\n|(3mm not counter sunk)\n|IFW-41 (3mm counter sunk)\n|-\n|6\n|Differential  pinion gear\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-61\n|IF-21\n|-\n|7\n|Differential  ring gear\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-61\n|IF-20\n|-\n|8\n|Engine\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|Kyosho GS21R\n| -\n|-\n|9\n|Manifold & Exhaust\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|BS-124 & GT-47\n| -\n|-\n|10\n|Front  Axels\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|dogbone\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|-\n|11\n|Front  Shock Stay\n|IF-3\n|IF-3\n|IFW-20\n|IF-47\n|IF-47\n|IFW-20\n|-\n|12\n|Front  torque rod\n| -\n| -\n|IFW-06\n| -\n|IFW-43\n|IFW-43\n|-\n|13\n|Main  Gear 46T\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IFW-03 (steel)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IFW-03 (steel)\n|-\n|14\n|Manifold\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|BS124\n| -\n|-\n|15\n|Rear  Axels\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|IFW-42 (universal)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|IFW-42 (universal)\n|-\n|16\n|Servo  Saver\n|IF-18\n|IF-18\n|IFW-04 (ball bearing)\n|IF-18\n|IF-18\n|IFW-04 (ball bearing)\n|-\n|17\n|Shocks\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n|IFW30 + IFW31\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n|BSW72 + BSW73\n|IFW30 + IFW31\n|-\n|18\n|Springs\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|IFW-33W\n|-\n|19\n|Stabilizer  Front\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|IFW-05\n|-\n|20\n|Stabilizer  Rear\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IFW-21 (thicker)\n|-\n|21\n|Steering  Plate\n|IF-19\n|IF-19\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|IF-19\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|-\n|22\n|Steering  Rod Set\n| IF-19\n| IF-19\n| IFW-02 (adjustable)\n| IF-19\n|IF-19\n| IFW-02 (adjustable)\n|-\n|23\n|Wheel  stopper\n| \n| \n| \n| \n|IFW-44 (wide)\n| \n|-\n|24\n|Wheels\n|BSW80W\n|BSW80KG\n|None\n|BSW80W\n|BSW80BL\n|None\n|-\n|25\n|Wing\n| BSW71W\n| BSW71KG\n| None\n| BSW71W\n|BSW71BL\n| None\n|-\n|26\n|Wing  Collar Stay\n|IF-25\n|IF-25\n|IFW-07 (blue)\n|IF-25\n|IF-25\n|IFW-07 (blue)\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal swing to IFW62 in the later references.\n\n=== Notable optional parts ===\nMost of the in-house optional parts were available on the MP6 international and were relatively common compared to the Burns and Classic Inferno options due to the volume of cars that Kyosho was producing and selling by this point. As with the Classic Inferno, the rarest part is the special aluminum center diff, which in this case had part number IFW-8.  It was essentially very similar to the plastic parts they replaced and much less complex that the BSW-55 aluminum differential of the classic Inferno. As it was not provided with the MP6 International, unlike almost all other optional parts, one could assume that Kyosho did not consider it a cost-effective or desirable item.\n\n=== Box art and marketing material ===\nUnlike previous models, the cars on the front of the box of the MP5 and MP6 series were shown with bodies that were unpainted, clearly showing the internals of the car. Only a part of the front of the car had a semi transparent indication of the official paint scheme which could be found on the cars depicted on other parts of the box and in the marketing material.\n\nAlso, unlike the previous inferno models, the box art was largely the same regardless of the version of the car. The main box art showed the initial version of the car (standard MP5 or MP6), with different iterations being indicated by a label at the bottom right corner of the box. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=123736|title=Kyosho MP5 Evo Box|website=www.tamiyaclub.com}}</ref>  \n\nAn exception to this was the MP6 sport which had a clearly distinguishable box-art, and a car with a painted body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=132478&id=5484|title=Kyosho MP6 Box|website=www.tamiyaclub.com}}</ref> \n\nTo an extent, Kyosho used different colored wheels and wings to highlight the versions of the car on the main box-art however the color coding of these parts was sometimes not the same between the pictures seen in on the box and catalogs, and those which were available in the box. \n\n {| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Car\n!Main Box-Art\n!Main Catalog\n!Sold in Box\n|-\n|MP5\n|White\n|White\n|White\n|-\n|MP5 Evo1\n|White\n|White\n|Green\n|-\n|MP5 Evo2\n|White\n|White\n|None\n|-\n|MP6\n|Orange\n|White\n|None\n|-\n|MP6 Sport\n|Blue\n|Blue\n|Blue\n|-\n|MP6 Int.\n|Orange\n|Green (studio photo) & Orange (track photo)\n|None\n|}\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2002\u2013) ===\nAt the time of writing in 2018, the MP5 & MP6 are slowly attaining \"classic\" car status<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic.rc-junkies.net/?page_id=204|title=What makes a classic?|website=Classic RC Junkies}}</ref> and are not yet particularly sought after on the second hand market. Because of this, good condition MP5 Evo2's or MP6 Internationals are still affordable and parts cars are readily available. This can enable starting hobbyist to have what was once world championship winning technology for a relatively low price. Optional parts are also more readily available and cheaper than those for its Burns and Inferno predecessors.\n\nThe MP6 Sports did not have a good reputation due to its relatively high price and low performance<ref name=\":3\" /> and is typically only sought after by enthusiasts looking to complete a collection. As with the Inferno DX prices for these in good, original condition are relatively high as owners typically discarded the original, low cost parts.   \n\n== Inferno MP7.5  (2000\u20132004, 2009 for \"Sports\" models) ==\n\n===  Models and specifications ===\nAfter nearly 5 years of evolution rather than revolution with the MP5 and MP6 series of cars, Kyosho released the MP 7.5 which was redesigned from the ground up. The \".5\" allegedly stands for the 5 consecutive IFMAR World Championships which had been won by the Inferno series at the time of its release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintage-rc.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=141&t=20914&start=30|title=Kyosho Timeline Discussion|website=Vintage-RC}}</ref> \n\n==== MP7.5, item no. 31081 (2000\u20132004) ====\nAs with the other Infernos before it, this first release would provide a good intermediate level car, which could be upgraded to competition specifications relatively quickly. As with the later Kanai competition versions, the selection of the radio gear, motor and muffler were left to the buyer and were not included in the kit.  \n\n==== MP7.5 Sports v1, item no. 31192 (2001\u20132005), v2 item no. 31276 & 31277SG (2005\u20132009), v3 item no. 31278 (2009), v4 item no. 31279 (2009) ====\nFollowing the tradition of previous generations of the Inferno series, the entry level \"Sports\" variant was released a year after the initial mid-range car. It was largely pre-built (often branded as a \"Ready Set\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infernosonly.com/Kyosho_Inferno_Sports_4_Ready_Set_p/kyo31279t2-b.htm|title=Inforno Sports v4 for sale at Infernosonly.com|website=www.infernosonly.com}}</ref>, and was supplied with Kyosho's own GX-21 engine, a pre-painted body and the necessary remote control hardware. A notable exception was the 31277SG which was released with the higher performance GXR28SG engine. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rc.kyosho.com/en/31277sg.html|title=Kyosho Sports v2 31277sg|last=|first=|date=|website=Kyosho.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIt was setup to be easy to drive, with a wide power band and with a price tag of under 400 US Dollars it was aimed at casual and novice drivers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmart.com/kyosho-31275-inferno-mp75-sports-bluewhite-p-13165.html|title=RC Mart MP7.5 Sports|website=RC Mart}}</ref> In line with previous DX and Sports version there are a significant number of differences in the type and quality of parts between this entry level car, and the intermediate and competition variants. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?130955-Differences-between-Inferno-MP7-5-and-Sports-version|title=RC Groups, differences between MP7.5 Standard and MP7.5 Sports.|website=RCGroups.com}}</ref> During its production cycle there were 4 different releases of the MP7.5 Sports which had slightly different specifications and different color body shells, wheels and wings.\n\nAs there was no entry level model for the MP777 which succeeded the MP7.5 in 2005, Kyosho continued manufacturing the Sports versions of the MP 7.5 until 2009 at which point the MP777 was also discontinued.\n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 1, item no. 31191 (2000\u20132001) ====\nThis was the first ever car in the Kyosho line up to bare the name of its designer and factory race driver Yuichi Kanai. Yuichi Kanai developed all of the Kyosho 1/8 off-road buggies from the Kyosho Turbo Burns onward <ref name=\":1\" /> and was actively competing with the MP7.5 at the time. His name was used for the editions of the car that were released with a selection of the modifications he developed during the race seasons. Quad center disc brakes, special chassis and arms and a special rear wing were a few of the modifications. The Kanai editions were aimed to be competition ready cars for experienced, competitive drivers.\n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 2, item no. 31271 (2001\u20132002) ====\nThe Kanai 2 was an evolution of the Kanai 1 and focused on improved strength and steering geometry, and had double disk brakes<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/rc-1-8th-scale-buggies/2370135-whats-kyosho-difference-print.html|title=MP7.5 Differences|website=www.RCUniverse.com}}</ref>. \n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 3, item no. 31273 (2002\u20132004) ====\nThis was the final version of the MP7.5 which incorporated the lessons learned from the preceding IFMAR championships and other races in which the MP7.5 competed. This car relied less on completely re-designed parts but instead on slight modifications to existing parts to improve the setup and reliability of the car. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmart.com/kyosho-31273-inferno-mp75-yuichi-kanai-p-6078.html|title=RC Mart MP7.5 Kanai 3|website=RC Mart}}</ref> As with other performance variants, this model did not include items such as radio equipment, engine and mufflers as the ideal selection of these were highly dependent on both the track and the driver. In its original condition, the Kanai 3 can be recognized through its milled out chassis and titanium screws. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rctech.net/forum/nitro-off-road/813208-kyosho-mp7-5-kanai.html|title=RCTech MP7.5 Kanai|website=RC Tech}}</ref>\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2008\u2013) ===\nThe MP7.5 has many years to go before it becomes a classic. Due to the volumes that Kyosho produced it and the fact that there were no special, limited editions of the car, they are also of limited interest to collectors. They do however provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversion with Kyosho<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/ifw451.html|title=Kyosho Inferno Brushless Conversion Kit|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> and many 3rd party suppliers providing conversion kits. They are one of the most common and most economical secondhand Kyosho 1/8 scale cars available on the second hand market. This makes the 7.5 an excellent car for beginners who are looking for relatively modern technology with an abundance of replacement and performance parts with the option to convert to brushless if desired.\n\n== Inferno MP777  (2004\u20132008) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nThe MP777 was released in 2004 to celebrate 6 successive wins at the IFMAR world championships.<ref name=\":1\" /> The fact that this car was more of an evolution than a revolution compared to its predecessor is reflected through the retention of the number 7 as the first character of the model number. The main focus of the MP777 was increased durability, better fine tuning options, and improved handling characteristics by moving the center of gravity.  \n\n==== MP777, item no. 31777 (2004\u20132008) ====\nAmong the main changes to the layout and construction of the MP777 there was a newly positioned center of gravity, as well as longer stroke for the rear suspension and more suspension pin angles.  The durability was improved through additional components such as a muffler guard to prevent damage from lateral hits, guarded front hubs, and a newly designed \"dish type\" wheel to prevent dirt from getting in the axels on muddy tracks. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winrctech.com.hk/product_sub2_sub1.php?id=35&sid=7&bid=1&cc=1|title=MP777 Specs|website=www.winrctech.com.hk}}</ref> Although these changes do not seem significant they provided the foundation to win the IFMAR championship title that followed in Indonesia in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rccaraction.com/2012-ifmar-18-scale-off-road-world-championships-are-almost-here/|title=List of IFMAR Winners 1986 to 2010|website=www.rccaraction.com}}</ref>\n\n==== MP777 SP 1, item no. 31778 (2004\u20132005) ====\nThe SP1 had a number of upgrades including a \"traction control\" front differential, a machined Duralumin engine mount, various blue anodized alloy parts and also had a set of dampers which had a special coating on the inside to reduce friction. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31779.html|title=MP777 SP1 on Kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  \n\n==== MP777 SP 2, item no. 31779 & 31779S21 (2005\u20132006) ====\nThe SP2 had a couple of differences which were not apparent in the marketing material as this used the same car as the SP1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31779.html|title=MP777 SP2 on Kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kyosho.com/jpn/fun/magazine/pdf/rcw0510_1.pdf|title=Kyosho sales brochure|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> These included a wheelbase which had been lengthened by 4mm while the engine and R/C system had been moved 1.5mm to the rear to improve the stability and steering characteristics. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winrctech.com.hk/product_sub2_sub1.php?id=36&sid=7&bid=1&cc=1|title=MP777 SP2 Specs|website=www.winrctech.com.hk}}</ref>  \n\nThere was also a special edition with item number 31779S21 which included a Sirio S21BK EVO-2 engine, exhaust and manifold. \n==== MP777 WC, item no. 31780 & 31780S21 (2006\u20132008) ====\nThe MP777 WC Team Edition Kit came with a S21BK EVO-2 STI Motor. The car was a replica of the one which won the 7th IFMAR world championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31780s21.html|title=Kyosho MP777 WC 31780S21|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>   \n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2008\u2013) ===\nThe MP777 has many years to go before it becomes a classic, and because of the large number that were produced they are not very rare (with the exception of the \"s21\" model numbers with the Sirio engine). Therefore, most are of limited interest to collectors. They do, however, provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversions with Kyosho,<ref name=\":6\" /> and many third-party suppliers provide conversion kits.\n\n== Inferno MP9  (2008\u20132018) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nSimilar to Microsoft skipping Windows 9, or Apple the iPhone 9, the omission of an Kyosho MP8 model indicated a revolution between the new MP9 and the previous MP7X models. Despite being redesigned from the ground up, the process apparently only took 6 months.<ref name=\":1\" /> A true indication of this revolution is the fact that the MP9 also embraced the new brushless electric motor technology from the factory in addition to the traditional two stroke engine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/30898.html|title=MP9e TKI4 on Kyosho Website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> It shares almost no parts with the previous MP7X generation and from the second car onward the abbreviation \"TKI\" which stands for \"Team Kyosho International\" was added to the model name which had not been used before. \n\nThe MP9 has been less successful over its lifetime that the other Inferno models with only one win in 2010 by US driver Cody King <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femca-rc.com/?attachment_id=2583|title=IFMAR Winners 1986-2018|website=www.femca-rc.com}}</ref>, however there is also now considerably more competition as the cost of engineering and production of the vehicles has decreased over time. Nevertheless, it has won many other competitions and also earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR in 2016. <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/Kyosho-Inferno-TKI4-Buggy-Upgrade/dp/B01F3XLZ70|title=Kyosho TKI3 to TKI4 upgrade kit|website=www.amazon.com}}</ref>  \n\n==== MP9, item no. 31782 & 31783 (2008\u20132010) ====\nAlthough the internals of the car were new from the ground up <ref name=\":1\" />, the body still harked back to the long swooping lines and curves of previous Inferno models. This would start to change from the TKI2 model onward. Different from the MP6 and MP7.5 generations, the budget conscious version of the MP9 no longer used the \"Sports\" branding. Instead it was simply known as number 31783. As with previous entry level cars, the focus lay on keeping the overall characteristics and functionality of the car the same, with the main cost savings being in the materials and level of finish applied to the individual components.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31783.html|title=MP9 71783 Entry Level model|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  There were no \"ready-set\" pre-assembled cars in this first release.  \n\n==== MP9TKI2, item no. 31784, 31785, 31785CK, 31785JT, 31786 & 31787 (2010\u20132012) ====\nWith the ever increasing speed of the cars, aerodynamics of the body started to play a more important role. This was also noticeable in the marketing material for later models. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amainhobbies.com/kyosho-inferno-mp9-tki4-10th-anniversary-special-edition-1-8-nitro-buggy-kit-kyo33011b/p733364|title=MP9 TKI4 10 anniversary edition at Amainhobbies|website=www.ammainhobbies.com}}</ref> The \"cabin\" section of the body became more steeply racked and the back of the body was tapered upwards towards the spoiler. These changes started a shift away from the traditional drawn out, rounded lines that started with the [[Kyosho Burns|Turbo Burns]] back in the late 1980s. The TKI2 started with a semi-assembled 31784 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31784.html|title=MP9 item no.31784 semi assembled on kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> and a regular un-assembled 31785 kit. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31785.html|title=MP9 TKI2 31785|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>\n\nAnother first was the launch of limited edition models named after Kyosho team drivers Cody King<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31785ck.html|title=MP9 TKI2CR Cody King Special|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> who won the IFMAR championship in 2010, and [[Jared Tebo]] who was the top qualifier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31785jt.html|title=MP9 TKI2JT Jared Tebo special edition|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> They had set numbers 31785CK and 31785JT respectively. The cars were released to celebrate the 8th IFMAR victory and featured the same engine as the championship winning car. Depending on the model, either King's or Tebo's signatures were engraved on the mufflers. As with the MP777 there was also a general World Championship \"WC\" car released which was not driver specific. It had item number 31786 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31786.html|title=MP9 TKI2 31786 Semi Assembled|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  followed by a semi-assembled \"Spec A\" version of the same car with item number 31787<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31787.html|title=MP9 TKI2 WC Limited Edition Spec-A|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>. This was the final release for the TKI2 range of cars.     \n\n==== MP9TKI3, item no. 31788 & 31888 & 31889T1  (2012\u20132016) ====\nThe TKI3 was a relatively minor evolution of the TKI2 focusing on strengthening certain components and re-positioning of some parts to further optimize the handling. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31788.html|title=MP9 TKI3|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> The big change in the TKI3 line-up was the introduction of a ready-set car which was completely pre-assembled and featured metal parts that were stamped rather than machined to further reduce the cost.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31889t1.html|title=MP9 TKI3 Ready Set|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> There were two model numbers, 31888 and 31889T1 which both had KE21R engines. Based on Kyosho's archive, the 31889T1 was roughly 25% cheaper than a regular, un-assembled version (approx. 60,000 vs. 80,000 Yen), yet included an engine and all necessary electronics.<ref name=\":9\" /> The car appeared to be less of a compromise compared to previous \"Sports\" iterations and offered a more competitive car for entry level enthusiast. Continuing the public's interest in \"ready-set\" cars, the MP9TKI3 was also released as a palm sized Mini-Z version which could be driven indoors and had item number 32081BB. This was the first indication of a true commercialization for the Kyosho Inferno brand.\n\n==== MP9TKI4, item no. 33001, 33007, 30898 & KYO33011B (2016\u20132018) ====\nIn 2016 the TKI4 earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR championships however the changes between the TKI3 and TKI4 were probably among the smallest between Kyosho releases. This can be seen from the parts available in the TKI3 upgrade pack provided by Kyosho.<ref name=\":8\" /> This car was also available as a partially assembled \"Spec-A\" variant with number 33007. The innovation which might have been missing between the TKI3 and TKI4 was definitely compensated for by the MP9e brushless Kit with number 30898. This was the first electric 1:8 off-road buggy that Kyosho had released from the factory and showed the company embracing an entirely different type of technology which not only brings drastic changes to the way a car handles and performs but also requires entirely new parts and a different layout to maintain similar handling characteristics.\n\nIn 2018 an important milestone was reached as the TKI4 welcomed the 10th anniversary of the MP9 series of cars (number KYO33011B). 10 years is the longest production run of any of the 1/8 Kyosho off-road models. This edition also includes many optional parts in the standard kit and is the highest-spec. TKI4.<ref name=\":7\" /> Even more impressive is that in 2018 one also celebrated 30 years since the release of the [[Kyosho Burns|MP1 Burns series]] which essentially set the foundation for all the 1:8 Kyosho Buggys that followed.\n\n== Inferno MP10  (2019\u2013) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\n==== MP10, item no. 33015 (2019\u2013) ====\nIn January 2019 Kyosho released the new MP10  marking an end to the 10-year production cycle of the MP9. The new car was redesigned from the ground up and Kyosho goes to great lengths to show this by illustrating the main changes to the MP9 in detail on the MP10's webpage. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/inferno-mp10/|title=Inferno MP10 on Kyosho main page|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> \n\n== External references and citations ==\n=== External references ===\n* [http://www.rcmagvintage.com/viewforum.php?f=105 Vintage Kyosho Thread at rcmagvintage.com]\n* [http://www.retromodelisme.com/home.html Kyosho Thread on Retromodelisme]\n* [https://www.tamiyaclub.com/forum/index.php?/forum/20-kyosho/ Kyosho Thread on Tamiyaclub.com] \n* [http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/rc-classic-cars-trucks-513/9089874-vintage-kyosho-buggy-truck-pics-post-them.html Vintage Kyosho Buggy Thread on RCUniverse.com] \n* [http://www.rc-forum.de/forumdisplay.php?693-Kyosho-Offroad Kyosho Thread on RC-Forum.de]\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Model cars]]\n[[Category:Kyosho]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Japanese radio controlled car}}\n<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Kyosho ''Inferno''}}\n{{Infobox racing car|Car_name=Kyosho Inferno|Image=|Caption=Kyosho Inferno|Category=[[1:8 radio-controlled off-road buggy|1:8 4WD off-road buggy]]|Constructor=[[Kyosho]]|Designer=|Predecessor=Kyosho Burns Series|Successor=|Team=|Drivers=|Technical ref=<!-- <ref name=tech>Insert formatted reference</ref> -->|Chassis=Aluminum|Front suspension=Independent wishbone|Rear suspension=Independent wishbone|Length=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->|Width=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->|Height=|Wheelbase=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->|Track=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} -->|Gearbox name=|Gears=Shaft driven four-wheel-drive|Type=|Differential=3x 3-gear differentials|Steering=|Weight=<!-- Use: {{convert|XXX|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} -->|Fuel=Nitro|Lubricants=|Brakes=Double center disc brakes (for front and rear)|Tyres=Rubber pin spike off-road tires with foam inserts|Debut=1991|First_win=|Last_win=|Last_event=|Entries=|Races=|Wins=|Podiums=|Poles=|Fastest_laps=|Titles=|Cons_champ=|Drivers_champ=|Teams_champ=|Engine=Two-stroke .21 \"Nitro\" (3.5cc)|Engine position=Mid mounted}}\nDesigned by Yuichi Kanai<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rccaraction.com/interview-kyoshos-yuichi-kanai-father-of-the-inferno/|title=Kyosho's Yuichi Kanai Father of the Inferno|website=RC Car Action}}</ref> the '''[[Kyosho]] Inferno''' is a  1/8 scale, four-wheel-drive, off-road competition buggy which was first released in late 1991 as the successor to the [[Kyosho Burns|Kyosho Turbo Burns]]<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.kyosho.com/eng/company/rccar_history02.html|title=Kyosho RC Car History|website=Kyosho Company Website}}</ref>.  As with the Burns series that came before it, each model has several versions with different factory specifications to suit specific budgets and skill levels. The first generation (MP3/MP4), now referred to as the \"classic Inferno\", was produced from late 1991 to the end of 1996 and won every [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR world championship]] during its production run. With 8 [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR]] titles under its belt, the Kyosho Inferno has been the most successful RC car in its scale and deserves the \"fire\" themed brand name which has been in use since the release of the [[Kyosho Burns]] in 1988. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== General history ==\n\n=== Background ===\nThe first generation of Infernos were produced from late 1991 to 1996 and shared only a few parts with its predecessor the [[Kyosho Burns|Kyosho Turbo Burns]]. The Inferno was almost a complete redesign based on experiences in competition to increase performance, durability and ease of maintenance.  Any similarity with the Burns series of cars was lost with the introduction of the Inferno MP5 in 1995 which introduced design <u>characteristics</u> which can still be found in the current MP10 more than 20 years later.   \n\nWith the introduction of the Inferno, [[Kyosho]] also chose to sell partially assembled, entry-level kits and introduced their own line of budget GS engines.\n\nAs with the Burns predecessor, it was possible to start with the most affordable car and upgrade to a full option, competition-ready vehicle when the skill and budget allowed. Alternatively one could also buy a competition car for far less than the cost of the individual optional parts.\n\nIt is often not known that the MP (Model Project) nomenclature, which is synonymous with Kyosho buggies from the MP5 onward, was already in use at [[Kyosho]] for the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]] and first Inferno series of cars. Burns MP1, Turbo Burns MP2, Inferno MP3, Turbo Inferno MP4.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\"<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic.rc-junkies.net/?p=549|title=Kyosho Landmax history|website=www.classic.rc-junkies.net}}</ref> and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001, and then the Inferno MP7.5 chassis until 2008. The ST series is still going strong today although the components used bare little resemblance to the current Inferno buggy.

Not long after, this would be followed by a more affordable \"DX\" version and then a high performance \"Turbo\" version.  The cars were typically released in kit form; however, Kyosho chose to release \"DX\" entry-level models partially assembled, making the car more attractive for customers who were completely new to the hobby.  Depending on the country of release, the DX models would also include Kyosho's own GS engine, which was already set up and ready to run. This further reduced the complexity and made an otherwise highly technical hobby more approachable for a larger audience.  \n\nThe success of this approach can be seen in the extent to which budget DX cars, that are available second hand, have been upgraded by their owners over time as they gained skill and confidence in the hobby. The Inferno's popularity also spawned a large number of 3rd party suppliers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rc10talk.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=42144&start=105|title=3rd party optional parts for the classic Kyosho Inferno|website=www.rc10talk.com}}</ref> that provided additional performance accessories such as brake discs, carbon fiber plates etc. Original Kyosho parts for these cars were still mostly given the \"BS\" and \"BSW\" nomenclature from the Burns series of cars and were also partially compatible with them. Later models received part numbers starting with IF and IFW.   \n\nThe versatility of this platform also enabled Kyosho to create 1:8 scale road and rally cars called the \"Super Eight GP LANDMAX 4WD\"<ref name=\":10\" /> and the Inferno ST (Stadium Truck) series. The Landmax were based on the original Inferno chassis until 2001 and the original ST until 2005<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-inferno-st.htm|title=Kyosho Inferno ST on RC Scrapyard|website=www.rcscrapyard.net}}</ref>, nearly a decade after the production of the classic Inferno buggy ended.    \n\nAfter winning every world championship during its production run, the classic Inferno was phased out in favor of the MP5 in 1995. \n\n==== Inferno 4WD, item no. 3281 (late 1991 \u2013 late 1993) ====\nAs the successor to the Turbo Burns, the classic Inferno not only had a couple of the same parts, but also had a similar body design and countersunk chassis plate. The similarities were largely superficial however with only the following parts being interchangeable with its predecessor. \n* Differentials (however Burns had 2 bevel gears, classic and Turbo Inferno had 4, see comparison table below)<ref name=\":0\" /> \n* Wing and wing mount \n* Shock absorbers \n* Wishbones, hubs and axles\n* Fuel tank \n* Engine mount \n* Most screws, nuts, washers, etc. \nThe car introduced many new design elements and notable improvements which would largely continue in subsequent Inferno models \n* Single radio tray which held all electrical components and could be switched quickly as one unit when desired. (Burns radio tray did not hold the throttle servo)  \n* Stronger shock mounts with more mounting options \n* Differentials with 4 bevel gears (Burns had 2)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/148807212@N06/37470601544/in/photostream/#|title=Kyosho Differential Comparison|website=Flickr}}</ref> \n* Two part diff housings for faster maintenance (Burns diff. housing consisted of 5 parts)\n* New wheels and tires \n** Wide at front and back (Burns had narrow wheels and tires at front with the exception of the limited edition Turbo Burns SCC)\n** Micro spike tires instead of regular spikes\n** Lighter wheels with narrower spokes\n* Separate front and rear disc brake (This was an optional part for the Burns towards the end of its production run and was supplied with the limited edition [[Kyosho Burns|Turbo Burns SCC]]. The Inferno brake setup is not compatible with the Burns series.)\n\n==== Inferno DX; item no. 3290h (1992\u20131994) ====\nJust like the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]], the \"DX\" referred to the entry-level specification car. Unlike the Burns, however, this DX came partially assembled and some metal parts such as the exhaust and shock absorbers were replaced with plastic parts. An overview of the differences can be seen in the table below. The BS121 ring and pinion gears were made from a cheaper alloy material instead of the steel gears which were found in the Classic and Turbo versions of the car<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\nUnlike the Inferno 4WD und Turbo Inferno, the chassis of the car had additional holes to mount the Kyosho GS21-CR series engine. This particular engine is recognizable by its heat-sink which has vertical instead of the more common horizontal fins<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/c20xB4|title=Kyosho .21 GS21-RC Head|website=Flickr}}</ref>. An interesting cost saving measure was also the lack of countersunk holes in the chassis which would have required an extra production step. This had not been seen since the original Burns.\n\n==== Turbo Inferno; item no. 31346 (1994\u20131995) ====\nContinuing the model naming of the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns series]], the first series of Inferno cars also used the name \"Turbo\" to signify the car with the largest number of performance parts. Visually the Turbo Inferno could easily be identified by the anodized blue chassis plate and larger capacity, blue shock absorbers. Interestingly Kyosho did not include the blue anodized plates which were mounted in the steering and center differential of the Inferno DXII which was released the following year. The Turbo Inferno also included newly designed green wheels, a green spoiler, and unique \"high grip\" tires (part W5646H) which were supplied from the factory. Other than that the car was very similar in specification to the Inferno 4WD as can be seen in the comparison table below. The new, rigid plastic spoiler was the first departure from the Lexan versions which had been used until that point and would remain standard equipment on all future Inferno models.\n\n==== Inferno DX II Ltd.; item no. 31552 (1995\u20131996) ====\nThe DXII used pieces from the initial classic Inferno 4WD, first Inferno DX and Turbo Burns. Most notable differences from the first DX were: \n* The plastic shock absorbers were replaced with those from the classic Inferno 4WD (same type as Turbo Burns)\n* The metal bearings were replaced with the ball bearings from the classic Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno\n* The plastic muffler and rubber manifold were replaced with the Aluminum tuned muffler and manifold from the older Turbo Burns\n* The Lexan wing was replaced with the hard plastic wing of the Turbo Inferno, however in the same yellow of the wheels instead of the Turbo's green. Although the part number of the wing stayed the same (BSW-71KY), Kyosho changed the color to neon yellow after the DXII was discontinued making the original yellow wing one of the hardest parts to find for collectors and restorers.\n\nIn addition the DXII had all blue anodized plates (with the exception of the chassis), and an additional hole in the chassis to accommodate a pull start. Some DXII kits also included the GS21-X engine. This engine had a new, larger head with horizontal fins to compensate for the overheating issues of the previous GS21-CR.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/wf62v7|title=Kyosho GS-21 X|website=Flickr}}</ref> The new head was available in plain aluminum (part 6520-31) and later with a blue anodized head (part 6520-31bl)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/L84349|title=Kyosho GS21 X later model heat sink 6520-31|website=Flickr}}</ref> to match the other blue plates on the car.\n\nAs there was no entry-level \"Sports\" version of the subsequent MP5 model the Inferno DXII remained Kyosho's entry-level car until 1996. Kyosho would not release another entry level 1/8 Buggy until the MP6 Sports in 1999. \n\n==== Overview of main differences between classic Inferno models ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\u00a0\n|'''Part name'''\n|'''Turbo Inferno'''\n|'''Inferno 4WD'''\n|'''Inferno DX'''\n|'''Inferno DXII Limited'''\n|-\n|'''1'''\n|Differential ring gear\n|BS14*\n|BS14*\n|BS121\n|BS121\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|Differential pinion gear\n|BS14*\n|BS14*\n|BS121\n|BS121\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|Differential bevel gear (S)\n|BS37 (2 pairs per  diff)\n|BS37 (2 pairs per  diff)\n|BS37 (1 pair per diff)\n|BS37 (1 pair per diff)\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|Differential bevel gear (L)\n|BSW64\n|BS36\n|BS36\n|BS36\n|-\n|'''5'''\n|Tires\n|W5646H\n|BSW40\n|BSW40\n|BSW40\n|-\n|'''6'''\n|Chassis\n|BS108**** (blue anodized)\n|BS108\n|BS120\n|GT28\n|-\n|'''7'''\n|Ball bearings\n|Full\n|Full\n|Metal Bushings\n|Full\n|-\n|'''8'''\n|Wheels\n|BSW80KG\n|BS105\n|BS105\n|BS105\n|-\n|'''9'''\n|Wing\n|BSW71KG (Plastic)***\n|BSW5 (Lexan)\n|BSW5 (Lexan)\n|BSW71KY (Plastic)***\n|-\n|'''10'''\n|Shocks\n|BSW72 + BSW73\n|BSW27 + BSW28\n|2001 & 2002  plastic\n|BSW27 + BSW28\n|-\n|'''11'''\n|Front Axels\n|BS20 (Universal)**\n|BS20 (Universal)**\n|BS45 (Dog Bones)\n|BS45 (Dog Bones)\n|-\n|'''12'''\n|Center Diff \n|BSW34 (Adjustable)\n|BSW34 (Adjustable)\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|'''13'''\n|Spur gear\n|BS11\n|BS11\n|BS122\n|BS122\n|-\n|'''14'''\n|Stabilizer\n|BS63 + BSW79\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|'''15'''\n|Fuel Tank\n|BS65\n|BS65\n|BS28\n|BS65\n|-\n|'''16'''\n|Exhaust\n| -\n| -\n|BS123\n|BS64\n|-\n|'''17'''\n|Manifold\n| -\n| -\n|BS124\n|BS26\n|-\n|'''18'''\n|Engine\n| -\n| -\n|Kyosho GS21CR (optional)\n|Kyosho GS21X\n|-\n|'''19'''\n|Plate Set\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116\n|BS115 + BS116 (both blue anodized)\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Depending on the market and year of production the Turbo Infernos and Inferno 4WDs may also have been supplied with BSW-1 and BSW-2 hardened gears from the factory instead of the standard BS-14 set.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.rc10talk.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&t=42144&start=45&sid=ac245d6201ce746288d802c59dd88a5a|title=BSW-1 and BSW-2 gear discussion on RC10Talk|website=RC10Talk}}</ref>\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal joint to IFW62 in the later references.\n\n<nowiki>***</nowiki> Kyosho eventually changed the part numbering of the BSW71 wing to  IFW213.

The later MP5 and MP6 had similar parts which however were <u>not</u> compatible with the classic Inferno. \n\nThe BSW-55 special diff housing and BSW-82 One Way Diff are among the most rare and expensive parts on the second-hand market<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/3Y9921|title=BSW-55, BSW-82 and BSW-19 on Flickr|website=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/148807212@N06/38181097951/in/photostream/|title=BSW-55 & BSW-82 disassembled on Flickr|website=Flickr}}</ref>.\n\nOne of the more common, and frequently discussed optional parts are the hardened BSW-1 and BSW-2 differential gears<ref name=\":4\" />. It is also the only series of infernos that had 3 different specifications of differentials (depending on the country of sale). As can be seen in the table above the budget Inferno DX models used a cheaper alloy gear set (BS-121), while the mid-range Inferno 4WD cars came with the BS-14 from the Burns generation, and the Turbo Inferno was supplied with the BS-14 or the optional BSW-1 and BSW-2 set depending on the country of sale.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Box art and marketing material ===\nThe Inferno series continued the same style of box art and marketing material of its predecessor using mostly studio pictures of assembled and painted models. The only exception was the Turbo Inferno which came in a plane white and green box with a drawn outline of the car on the front<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.retromodelisme.com/voiture/255-1/turbo-inferno-kit-kyosho.html|title=Turbo Inferno Unboxing|website=www.retromodelisme.com}}</ref>. The Inferno and Inferno DX/DXII came with a box which had an integrated handle.\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (1996\u2013) ===\nAs with the [[Kyosho Burns|Burns]], the most collectible of this initial line-up is the Turbo version. This is in part due to its rarity, especially in good condition. Collectors specifically look for cars on which the blue anodized chassis has no damage, as well as unused tires The blue anodized verion of the chassis with part number BS108 was not available as spare part which makes it particularly dificult to find new.<ref name=\":11\" />  The demand and value on the second hand market is however significantly lower than the Turbo Burns which preceded it, with near mint condition cars with box often selling for less than 200 US Dollars. Collectors are also interested in the first DX in its original configuration as these were typically upgraded by their owners over time. Their original [[Kyosho]] engine, plastic shock absorbers and exhaust being discarded for higher performance parts \n\nDue to the low re-sale value and an abundance of spare parts, as well as reproduction parts such as new bodies and decals<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marwanrc.com/main.sc;jsessionid=4EC1D4EC52D4AE3E818C846D4BFFD2A6.p3plqscsfapp003|title=Marwan RC|website=MarwanRC}}</ref>, the Inferno 4WD and Turbo Inferno are a good choice for entry and intermediate level RC buggy enthusiasts. Scans of the original instruction manuals for the various Inferno models are also available online.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.retromodelisme.com/liste_manuel.html|title=Manual search page on retromodelise.com|last=|first=|date=|website=retromodelisme|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>   \n\nIn lieu of noise restrictions and the advances of battery and brushless technology, some cars are also being converted to an electric powertrain<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.modelbouwforum.nl/threads/kyosho-inferno-dx-brushless.222967/|title=Kyosho Inferno DX Brushless|website=modelbouwforum.nl}}</ref>.\n\n== Inferno MP5 & MP6 (1995\u20132002) ==\n\n===  Models and specifications ===\nThe MP5 was the first of kyosho's 1:8 buggy line up to use the \"MP\" (Model Project), name in public and was largely a clean break from it predecessors as far as the \"BS\" and \"BSW\" parts compatibility is concerned.  The few remaining parts which are still compatible with the previous Burns cars (MP1-MP2) include the 19mm hex wheels (which would later be changed to 17mm on the Inferno 7.5 as a new industry standard), and the fuel tank. A few other parts such as the wing design, shock absorbers and brake discs were carried across from the Turbo Inferno.\n\nThe MP5/MP6 also included some new design features which remain with the current Inferno line up. \n* Upward angle (kick-up) at the front of chassis<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=121580&id=5484|title=Kyosho MP5 Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref>\n* Splash resistant box for receiver and other electronics (instead of being mounted on the radio tray with the servos)\n\nLike its predecessors, the MP3 and MP4 Infernos, the MP5 & MP6 won every [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR]] title during their production run, first in its standard form and later with the EVO editions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.neobuggy.net/2012/11/27/the-world-champions-cars-2010-1986/|title=RC 1:8 Buggy World Championship Winners 1986-2010|website=Neobuggy.net}}</ref> The MP5 and MP6 are visually nearly identical using the same body and wheels, however the MP6 had a longer chassis and wider rear track. Prior to the MP6 this relatively small change was also available on the MP5 in form of a long wheelbase conversion kit. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=53264&sid=5484|title=Kyosho MP5 Long Wheelbase conversion kit|website=TamiyaClub.com}}</ref> \n\n====  MP5, item no. 31551 (1995\u20131998) ====\nAs with the previous Burns and Inferno models Kyosho released an intermediate level car first. Unlike its predecessors, however, no entry level MP5 was produced. \n\nThe MP5 won the world championship in 1996<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-Inferno-mp5.htm|title=MP5 on RCScrapyard|website=RC Scrapyard}}</ref>, and was marketed as a competition buggy with many in-house options being made available within its first year of production. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmagvintage.com/reviews/retro/voitures/tt/musee/kyosho/catalogues/minicataloguemp5/minicataloguemp5.htm|title=MP5 Options Catalog|website=RCMagvintage}}</ref> \n\n==== MP5 With Picco P6B, item no. 31663P (1996) ====\nA standard Inferno MP5 model packed from the factory with a Picco P6B engine, also includes a manifold and muffler. This version of the Inferno MP5 is identified by a sticker on the button right corner of the box.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmagvintage.com/reviews/retro/voitures/tt/musee/kyosho/catalogues/minicataloguemp5/minicataloguemp5.htm|title=MP5 Options Catalog|website=RCMagvintage}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcscrapyard.net/kyosho-Inferno-mp5.htm|title=MP5 on RCScrapyard|website=RC Scrapyard}}</ref>  \n==== MP5 EVO1, item no. 31664 (1996\u20131997) ====\nWith the \"EVO\" branding Kyosho distanced itself from the \"Turbo\" nomenclature used for the marketing of previously upgraded vehicles. It was released in 1996 and included a few parts from the options catalog<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=123736&sid=5484|title=MP5 EVO 1 Unboxing and Additional Instruction Manual|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref>. Unlike the standard MP5 which was supplied with the white wheels and wing that were featured on the box art, the EVO1 was supplied with a set of green wheels and a green wing. The car was sold for one year before being replaced by the EVO2.\n\n==== MP5 EVO2, item no. 31781 (1997\u20131998) ====\nThe EVO2 was based closely on the car which won the 1996 World Championship<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=114210|title=Kyosho MP5 EVO2 Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref> Among various options the most noticeable difference to the previous MP5 models was the longer chassis and rear wishbones which were later used for the MP6. The chassis extension was also available as an upgrade package for previous MP5s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marwanrc.com/product.sc?productId=93|title=Example of long wheelbase kit for sale|website=www.marwanrc.om}}</ref> Unlike the previous 2 models, this car was not supplied with wheels or a wing. <ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== MP6, item no. 31891 (1998\u20132002) ====\nThe MP6 was essentially a standard MP5 with the longer chassis and wishbones used for the MP5 EVOII, and stronger, blue anodized shock towers. In addition to the shock towers, all other Aluminum plates on the MP6 models were also anodized in blue. The unique feature of this \"standard\" MP6 is the gold anodized chassis plate which is highly sought after in good condition.\n\nA special edition was later released featuring the large capacity shocks of the MP6 International<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/71p5ti|title=MP6 Standard special large shock edition|website=Flickr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/gp/148807212@N06/92W457|title=MP6 Standard, special large shock edition|website=Flickr}}</ref>.\n\n==== MP6 Sport, item no. 31951 (1999\u20132002) ====\nFormerly referred to as the \"DX\" for the Burns and classic Inferno series of cars, the \"Sport\" was the entry-level car for the MP6 range. It had similar specification changes as the Inferno DXII and was also supplied with a Kyosho GS21 engine with a blue head to match the blue theme of the car (part 6520-31bl).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/clubtt/buggys.html|title=MP6 Overview|website=Geocities}}</ref> Kyosho supplied the sport with a 3&nbsp;mm chassis instead of the 2.5&nbsp;mm of the standard MP6<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.offroad-cult.org/Tracktest/Inferno%20MP6%20SPORTS/Kyosho%20MP6%20Sports.htm|title=MP6 Sports review|website=Offroad Cult}}</ref>. This may lead one to believe that this was a stronger version to outlive the driving of a novice driver; however, the 2.5&nbsp;mm was actually made from a harder alloy. As with the \"DX\" cars, it was possible to upgrade this car to a standard or international version but at a significantly greater cost than if one had bought the international kit directly.\n\n==== MP6 International, item no. 31892 (1998\u20132002) ====\nThe term MP6 \"International\" was used instead of the \"EVO\" nomenclature used to describe performance versions of the MP5 series. The word \"International\" would not be used in this context again but would reappear from the MP9 TKI2 to TKI4, with the \"TKI\" standing for \"Team Kyosho International\". Unlike the MP5 EVO which only had a selection of optional parts, the MP6 featured almost every available option.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=48595|title=Kyosho MP6 International Unboxing|website=Tamiya Club}}</ref> As most of these options were already available for the MP5, the MP6 International could be released only one year after sales for the standard MP6 started.\n\n==== Overview of main differences between MP5 & MP6 models ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\u00a0\n|'''Part name'''\n|'''MP5'''\n|'''MP5 EVO1'''\n|'''MP5 EVO2'''\n|'''MP6'''\n|'''MP6 Sport'''\n|'''MP6 International'''\n|-\n|1\n|Ball  bearings\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|Full\n|-\n|2\n|Brakes\n|IF-28\n|IF-28\n|IF-28\n|IFW-53\n|IF-28\n|IFW-53 but with double disc\n|-\n|3\n|Center  Shaft front\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-12 (universal)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-12 (universal)\n|-\n|4\n|Center  Shaft rear\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IFW-45 (universal)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n| IF-33 (dogbone)\n|IFW-45 (universal)\n|-\n|5\n|Chassis\n|IF-4 (2,5mm)\n|IF-4 (2,5mm)\n|IFW-41 (3mm counter sunk)\n|IF-44 (2,5mm, Gold)\n|(3mm not counter sunk)\n|IFW-41 (3mm counter sunk)\n|-\n|6\n|Differential  pinion gear\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-21\n|IF-61\n|IF-21\n|-\n|7\n|Differential  ring gear\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-20\n|IF-61\n|IF-20\n|-\n|8\n|Engine\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|Kyosho GS21R\n| -\n|-\n|9\n|Manifold & Exhaust\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|BS-124 & GT-47\n| -\n|-\n|10\n|Front  Axels\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|dogbone\n|BS-20 (universal)*\n|-\n|11\n|Front  Shock Stay\n|IF-3\n|IF-3\n|IFW-20\n|IF-47\n|IF-47\n|IFW-20\n|-\n|12\n|Front  torque rod\n| -\n| -\n|IFW-06\n| -\n|IFW-43\n|IFW-43\n|-\n|13\n|Main  Gear 46T\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IFW-03 (steel)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IF-22 (plastic)\n|IFW-03 (steel)\n|-\n|14\n|Manifold\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|BS124\n| -\n|-\n|15\n|Rear  Axels\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|IFW-42 (universal)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|BS-45 (dogbone)\n|IFW-42 (universal)\n|-\n|16\n|Servo  Saver\n|IF-18\n|IF-18\n|IFW-04 (ball bearing)\n|IF-18\n|IF-18\n|IFW-04 (ball bearing)\n|-\n|17\n|Shocks\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n|IFW30 + IFW31\n| BSW72 + BSW73\n|BSW72 + BSW73\n|IFW30 + IFW31\n|-\n|18\n|Springs\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|IFW-33W\n|-\n|19\n|Stabilizer  Front\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n| -\n|IFW-05\n|-\n|20\n|Stabilizer  Rear\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IF-32\n|IFW-21 (thicker)\n|-\n|21\n|Steering  Plate\n|IF-19\n|IF-19\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|IF-19\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|IFW-14 (blue)\n|-\n|22\n|Steering  Rod Set\n| IF-19\n| IF-19\n| IFW-02 (adjustable)\n| IF-19\n|IF-19\n| IFW-02 (adjustable)\n|-\n|23\n|Wheel  stopper\n| \n| \n| \n| \n|IFW-44 (wide)\n| \n|-\n|24\n|Wheels\n|BSW80W\n|BSW80KG\n|None\n|BSW80W\n|BSW80BL\n|None\n|-\n|25\n|Wing\n| BSW71W\n| BSW71KG\n| None\n| BSW71W\n|BSW71BL\n| None\n|-\n|26\n|Wing  Collar Stay\n|IF-25\n|IF-25\n|IFW-07 (blue)\n|IF-25\n|IF-25\n|IFW-07 (blue)\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Kyosho changed the part numbering of BS20 universal swing to IFW62 in the later references.\n\n=== Notable optional parts ===\nMost of the in-house optional parts were available on the MP6 international and were relatively common compared to the Burns and Classic Inferno options due to the volume of cars that Kyosho was producing and selling by this point. As with the Classic Inferno, the rarest part is the special aluminum center diff, which in this case had part number IFW-8.  It was essentially very similar to the plastic parts they replaced and much less complex that the BSW-55 aluminum differential of the classic Inferno. As it was not provided with the MP6 International, unlike almost all other optional parts, one could assume that Kyosho did not consider it a cost-effective or desirable item.\n\n=== Box art and marketing material ===\nUnlike previous models, the cars on the front of the box of the MP5 and MP6 series were shown with bodies that were unpainted, clearly showing the internals of the car. Only a part of the front of the car had a semi transparent indication of the official paint scheme which could be found on the cars depicted on other parts of the box and in the marketing material.\n\nAlso, unlike the previous inferno models, the box art was largely the same regardless of the version of the car. The main box art showed the initial version of the car (standard MP5 or MP6), with different iterations being indicated by a label at the bottom right corner of the box. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=123736|title=Kyosho MP5 Evo Box|website=www.tamiyaclub.com}}</ref>  \n\nAn exception to this was the MP6 sport which had a clearly distinguishable box-art, and a car with a painted body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tamiyaclub.com/showroom_model.asp?cid=132478&id=5484|title=Kyosho MP6 Box|website=www.tamiyaclub.com}}</ref> \n\nTo an extent, Kyosho used different colored wheels and wings to highlight the versions of the car on the main box-art however the color coding of these parts was sometimes not the same between the pictures seen in on the box and catalogs, and those which were available in the box. \n\n {| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Car\n!Main Box-Art\n!Main Catalog\n!Sold in Box\n|-\n|MP5\n|White\n|White\n|White\n|-\n|MP5 Evo1\n|White\n|White\n|Green\n|-\n|MP5 Evo2\n|White\n|White\n|None\n|-\n|MP6\n|Orange\n|White\n|None\n|-\n|MP6 Sport\n|Blue\n|Blue\n|Blue\n|-\n|MP6 Int.\n|Orange\n|Green (studio photo) & Orange (track photo)\n|None\n|}\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2002\u2013) ===\nAt the time of writing in 2018, the MP5 & MP6 are slowly attaining \"classic\" car status<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic.rc-junkies.net/?page_id=204|title=What makes a classic?|website=Classic RC Junkies}}</ref> and are not yet particularly sought after on the second hand market. Because of this, good condition MP5 Evo2's or MP6 Internationals are still affordable and parts cars are readily available. This can enable starting hobbyist to have what was once world championship winning technology for a relatively low price. Optional parts are also more readily available and cheaper than those for its Burns and Inferno predecessors.\n\nThe MP6 Sports did not have a good reputation due to its relatively high price and low performance<ref name=\":3\" /> and is typically only sought after by enthusiasts looking to complete a collection. As with the Inferno DX prices for these in good, original condition are relatively high as owners typically discarded the original, low cost parts.   \n\n== Inferno MP7.5  (2000\u20132004, 2009 for \"Sports\" models) ==\n\n===  Models and specifications ===\nAfter nearly 5 years of evolution rather than revolution with the MP5 and MP6 series of cars, Kyosho released the MP 7.5 which was redesigned from the ground up. The \".5\" allegedly stands for the 5 consecutive IFMAR World Championships which had been won by the Inferno series at the time of its release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintage-rc.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=141&t=20914&start=30|title=Kyosho Timeline Discussion|website=Vintage-RC}}</ref> \n\n==== MP7.5, item no. 31081 (2000\u20132004) ====\nAs with the other Infernos before it, this first release would provide a good intermediate level car, which could be upgraded to competition specifications relatively quickly. As with the later Kanai competition versions, the selection of the radio gear, motor and muffler were left to the buyer and were not included in the kit.  \n\n==== MP7.5 Sports v1, item no. 31192 (2001\u20132005), v2 item no. 31276 (2005\u20132009), v3 item no. 31278 (2009), v4 item no. 31279 (2009) ====\nFollowing the tradition of previous generations of the Inferno series, the entry level \"Sports\" variant was released a year after the initial mid-range car. It was largely pre-built (often branded as a \"Ready Set\")<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infernosonly.com/Kyosho_Inferno_Sports_4_Ready_Set_p/kyo31279t2-b.htm|title=Inforno Sports v4 for sale at Infernosonly.com|website=www.infernosonly.com}}</ref>, and was supplied with Kyosho's own GX-21 engine, a pre-painted body and the necessary remote control hardware. It was setup to be easy to drive, with a wide power band and with a price tag of under 400 US Dollars it was aimed at casual and novice drivers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmart.com/kyosho-31275-inferno-mp75-sports-bluewhite-p-13165.html|title=RC Mart MP7.5 Sports|website=RC Mart}}</ref> In line with previous DX and Sports version there are a significant number of differences in the type and quality of parts between this entry level car, and the intermediate and competition variants. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?130955-Differences-between-Inferno-MP7-5-and-Sports-version|title=RC Groups, differences between MP7.5 Standard and MP7.5 Sports.|website=RCGroups.com}}</ref> During its production cycle there were 4 different releases of the MP7.5 Sports which had slightly different specifications and different color body shells, wheels and wings.\n\nAs there was no entry level model for the MP777 which succeeded the MP7.5 in 2005, Kyosho continued manufacturing the Sports versions of the MP 7.5 until 2009 at which point the MP777 was also discontinued.\n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 1, item no. 31191 (2000\u20132001) ====\nThis was the first ever car in the Kyosho line up to bare the name of its designer and factory race driver Yuichi Kanai. Yuichi Kanai developed all of the Kyosho 1/8 off-road buggies from the Kyosho Turbo Burns onward <ref name=\":1\" /> and was actively competing with the MP7.5 at the time. His name was used for the editions of the car that were released with a selection of the modifications he developed during the race seasons. Quad center disc brakes, special chassis and arms and a special rear wing were a few of the modifications. The Kanai editions were aimed to be competition ready cars for experienced, competitive drivers.\n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 2, item no. 31271 (2001\u20132002) ====\nThe Kanai 2 was an evolution of the Kanai 1 and focused on improved strength and steering geometry, and had double disk brakes<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/rc-1-8th-scale-buggies/2370135-whats-kyosho-difference-print.html|title=MP7.5 Differences|website=www.RCUniverse.com}}</ref>. \n\n==== MP7.5 Kanai 3, item no. 31273 (2002\u20132004) ====\nThis was the final version of the MP7.5 which incorporated the lessons learned from the preceding IFMAR championships and other races in which the MP7.5 competed. This car relied less on completely re-designed parts but instead on slight modifications to existing parts to improve the setup and reliability of the car. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmart.com/kyosho-31273-inferno-mp75-yuichi-kanai-p-6078.html|title=RC Mart MP7.5 Kanai 3|website=RC Mart}}</ref> As with other performance variants, this model did not include items such as radio equipment, engine and mufflers as the ideal selection of these were highly dependent on both the track and the driver. In its original condition, the Kanai 3 can be recognized through its milled out chassis and titanium screws. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rctech.net/forum/nitro-off-road/813208-kyosho-mp7-5-kanai.html|title=RCTech MP7.5 Kanai|website=RC Tech}}</ref>\n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2008\u2013) ===\nThe MP7.5 has many years to go before it becomes a classic. Due to the volumes that Kyosho produced it and the fact that there were no special, limited editions of the car, they are also of limited interest to collectors. They do however provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversion with Kyosho<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/ifw451.html|title=Kyosho Inferno Brushless Conversion Kit|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> and many 3rd party suppliers providing conversion kits. They are one of the most common and most economical secondhand Kyosho 1/8 scale cars available on the second hand market. This makes the 7.5 an excellent car for beginners who are looking for relatively modern technology with an abundance of replacement and performance parts with the option to convert to brushless if desired.\n\n== Inferno MP777  (2004\u20132008) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nThe MP777 was released in 2004 to celebrate 6 successive wins at the IFMAR world championships.<ref name=\":1\" /> The fact that this car was more of an evolution than a revolution compared to its predecessor is reflected through the retention of the number 7 as the first character of the model number. The main focus of the MP777 was increased durability, better fine tuning options, and improved handling characteristics by moving the center of gravity.  \n\n==== MP777, item no. 31777 (2004\u20132008) ====\nAmong the main changes to the layout and construction of the MP777 there was a newly positioned center of gravity, as well as longer stroke for the rear suspension and more suspension pin angles.  The durability was improved through additional components such as a muffler guard to prevent damage from lateral hits, guarded front hubs, and a newly designed \"dish type\" wheel to prevent dirt from getting in the axels on muddy tracks. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winrctech.com.hk/product_sub2_sub1.php?id=35&sid=7&bid=1&cc=1|title=MP777 Specs|website=www.winrctech.com.hk}}</ref> Although these changes do not seem significant they provided the foundation to win the IFMAR championship title that followed in Indonesia in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rccaraction.com/2012-ifmar-18-scale-off-road-world-championships-are-almost-here/|title=List of IFMAR Winners 1986 to 2010|website=www.rccaraction.com}}</ref>\n\n==== MP777 SP 1, item no. 31778 (2004\u20132005) ====\nThe SP1 had a number of upgrades including a \"traction control\" front differential, a machined Duralumin engine mount, various blue anodized alloy parts and also had a set of dampers which had a special coating on the inside to reduce friction. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31779.html|title=MP777 SP1 on Kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  \n\n==== MP777 SP 2, item no. 31779 & 31779S21 (2005\u20132006) ====\nThe SP2 had a couple of differences which were not apparent in the marketing material as this used the same car as the SP1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31779.html|title=MP777 SP2 on Kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kyosho.com/jpn/fun/magazine/pdf/rcw0510_1.pdf|title=Kyosho sales brochure|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> These included a wheelbase which had been lengthened by 4mm while the engine and R/C system had been moved 1.5mm to the rear to improve the stability and steering characteristics. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.winrctech.com.hk/product_sub2_sub1.php?id=36&sid=7&bid=1&cc=1|title=MP777 SP2 Specs|website=www.winrctech.com.hk}}</ref>  \n\nThere was also a special edition with item number 31779S21 which included a Sirio S21BK EVO-2 engine, exhaust and manifold. \n==== MP777 WC, item no. 31780 & 31780S21 (2006\u20132008) ====\nThe MP777 WC Team Edition Kit came with a S21BK EVO-2 STI Motor. The car was a replica of the one which won the 7th IFMAR world championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31780s21.html|title=Kyosho MP777 WC 31780S21|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>   \n\n=== Collectibillity and current popularity (2008\u2013) ===\nThe MP777 has many years to go before it becomes a classic, and because of the large number that were produced they are not very rare (with the exception of the \"s21\" model numbers with the Sirio engine). Therefore, most are of limited interest to collectors. They do, however, provide an excellent platform for brushless electric conversions with Kyosho,<ref name=\":6\" /> and many third-party suppliers provide conversion kits.\n\n== Inferno MP9  (2008\u20132018) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\nSimilar to Microsoft skipping Windows 9, or Apple the iPhone 9, the omission of an Kyosho MP8 model indicated a revolution between the new MP9 and the previous MP7X models. Despite being redesigned from the ground up, the process apparently only took 6 months.<ref name=\":1\" /> A true indication of this revolution is the fact that the MP9 also embraced the new brushless electric motor technology from the factory in addition to the traditional two stroke engine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/30898.html|title=MP9e TKI4 on Kyosho Website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> It shares almost no parts with the previous MP7X generation and from the second car onward the abbreviation \"TKI\" which stands for \"Team Kyosho International\" was added to the model name which had not been used before. \n\nThe MP9 has been less successful over its lifetime that the other Inferno models with only one win in 2010 by US driver Cody King <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femca-rc.com/?attachment_id=2583|title=IFMAR Winners 1986-2018|website=www.femca-rc.com}}</ref>, however there is also now considerably more competition as the cost of engineering and production of the vehicles has decreased over time. Nevertheless, it has won many other competitions and also earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR in 2016. <ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/Kyosho-Inferno-TKI4-Buggy-Upgrade/dp/B01F3XLZ70|title=Kyosho TKI3 to TKI4 upgrade kit|website=www.amazon.com}}</ref>  \n\n==== MP9, item no. 31782 & 31783 (2008\u20132010) ====\nAlthough the internals of the car were new from the ground up <ref name=\":1\" />, the body still harked back to the long swooping lines and curves of previous Inferno models. This would start to change from the TKI2 model onward. Different from the MP6 and MP7.5 generations, the budget conscious version of the MP9 no longer used the \"Sports\" branding. Instead it was simply known as number 31783. As with previous entry level cars, the focus lay on keeping the overall characteristics and functionality of the car the same, with the main cost savings being in the materials and level of finish applied to the individual components.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31783.html|title=MP9 71783 Entry Level model|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  There were no \"ready-set\" pre-assembled cars in this first release.  \n\n==== MP9TKI2, item no. 31784, 31785, 31785CK, 31785JT, 31786 & 31787 (2010\u20132012) ====\nWith the ever increasing speed of the cars, aerodynamics of the body started to play a more important role. This was also noticeable in the marketing material for later models. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amainhobbies.com/kyosho-inferno-mp9-tki4-10th-anniversary-special-edition-1-8-nitro-buggy-kit-kyo33011b/p733364|title=MP9 TKI4 10 anniversary edition at Amainhobbies|website=www.ammainhobbies.com}}</ref> The \"cabin\" section of the body became more steeply racked and the back of the body was tapered upwards towards the spoiler. These changes started a shift away from the traditional drawn out, rounded lines that started with the [[Kyosho Burns|Turbo Burns]] back in the late 1980s. The TKI2 started with a semi-assembled 31784 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31784.html|title=MP9 item no.31784 semi assembled on kyosho website|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> and a regular un-assembled 31785 kit. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31785.html|title=MP9 TKI2 31785|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>\n\nAnother first was the launch of limited edition models named after Kyosho team drivers Cody King<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31785ck.html|title=MP9 TKI2CR Cody King Special|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> who won the IFMAR championship in 2010, and [[Jared Tebo]] who was the top qualifier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31785jt.html|title=MP9 TKI2JT Jared Tebo special edition|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> They had set numbers 31785CK and 31785JT respectively. The cars were released to celebrate the 8th IFMAR victory and featured the same engine as the championship winning car. Depending on the model, either King's or Tebo's signatures were engraved on the mufflers. As with the MP777 there was also a general World Championship \"WC\" car released which was not driver specific. It had item number 31786 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/discontinued/dis-rccar/gpoffroad/31786.html|title=MP9 TKI2 31786 Semi Assembled|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>  followed by a semi-assembled \"Spec A\" version of the same car with item number 31787<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31787.html|title=MP9 TKI2 WC Limited Edition Spec-A|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref>. This was the final release for the TKI2 range of cars.     \n\n==== MP9TKI3, item no. 31788 & 31888 & 31889T1  (2012\u20132016) ====\nThe TKI3 was a relatively minor evolution of the TKI2 focusing on strengthening certain components and re-positioning of some parts to further optimize the handling. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31788.html|title=MP9 TKI3|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> The big change in the TKI3 line-up was the introduction of a ready-set car which was completely pre-assembled and featured metal parts that were stamped rather than machined to further reduce the cost.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/31889t1.html|title=MP9 TKI3 Ready Set|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> There were two model numbers, 31888 and 31889T1 which both had KE21R engines. Based on Kyosho's archive, the 31889T1 was roughly 25% cheaper than a regular, un-assembled version (approx. 60,000 vs. 80,000 Yen), yet included an engine and all necessary electronics.<ref name=\":9\" /> The car appeared to be less of a compromise compared to previous \"Sports\" iterations and offered a more competitive car for entry level enthusiast. Continuing the public's interest in \"ready-set\" cars, the MP9TKI3 was also released as a palm sized Mini-Z version which could be driven indoors and had item number 32081BB. This was the first indication of a true commercialization for the Kyosho Inferno brand.\n\n==== MP9TKI4, item no. 33001, 33007, 30898 & KYO33011B (2016\u20132018) ====\nIn 2016 the TKI4 earned a respectable second place at the IFMAR championships however the changes between the TKI3 and TKI4 were probably among the smallest between Kyosho releases. This can be seen from the parts available in the TKI3 upgrade pack provided by Kyosho.<ref name=\":8\" /> This car was also available as a partially assembled \"Spec-A\" variant with number 33007. The innovation which might have been missing between the TKI3 and TKI4 was definitely compensated for by the MP9e brushless Kit with number 30898. This was the first electric 1:8 off-road buggy that Kyosho had released from the factory and showed the company embracing an entirely different type of technology which not only brings drastic changes to the way a car handles and performs but also requires entirely new parts and a different layout to maintain similar handling characteristics.\n\nIn 2018 an important milestone was reached as the TKI4 welcomed the 10th anniversary of the MP9 series of cars (number KYO33011B). 10 years is the longest production run of any of the 1/8 Kyosho off-road models. This edition also includes many optional parts in the standard kit and is the highest-spec. TKI4.<ref name=\":7\" /> Even more impressive is that in 2018 one also celebrated 30 years since the release of the [[Kyosho Burns|MP1 Burns series]] which essentially set the foundation for all the 1:8 Kyosho Buggys that followed.\n\n== Inferno MP10  (2019\u2013) ==\n\n=== Models and specifications ===\n==== MP10, item no. 33015 (2019\u2013) ====\nIn January 2019 Kyosho released the new MP10  marking an end to the 10-year production cycle of the MP9. The new car was redesigned from the ground up and Kyosho goes to great lengths to show this by illustrating the main changes to the MP9 in detail on the MP10's webpage. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rc.kyosho.com/en/inferno-mp10/|title=Inferno MP10 on Kyosho main page|website=www.kyosho.com}}</ref> \n\n== External references and citations ==\n=== External references ===\n* [http://www.rcmagvintage.com/viewforum.php?f=105 Vintage Kyosho Thread at rcmagvintage.com]\n* [http://www.retromodelisme.com/home.html Kyosho Thread on Retromodelisme]\n* [https://www.tamiyaclub.com/forum/index.php?/forum/20-kyosho/ Kyosho Thread on Tamiyaclub.com] \n* [http://www.rcuniverse.com/forum/rc-classic-cars-trucks-513/9089874-vintage-kyosho-buggy-truck-pics-post-them.html Vintage Kyosho Buggy Thread on RCUniverse.com] \n* [http://www.rc-forum.de/forumdisplay.php?693-Kyosho-Offroad Kyosho Thread on RC-Forum.de]\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Model cars]]\n[[Category:Kyosho]]\n", "name_user": "Schotte", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added Inferno 31277sg", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyosho_Inferno"}

One of the most common rocks in the assemblage is known as Preseli Spotted Dolerite\u2014a chemically altered [[igneous rock]] containing spots or clusters of secondary minerals replacing [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]]. It is a medium grained dark and heavy rock, harder than granite. Preseli bluestone tools, such as axes, have been discovered elsewhere within the British Isles. Many of them appear to have been made in or near Stonehenge, since there are petrographic similarities with some of the spotted [[dolerite]]s there.

It was one of the favoured building materials during the [[Victorian Gold Rush]] period of the 1850s. In [[Melbourne]] it was extracted from quarries throughout the inner northern suburbs, such as [[Clifton Hill, Victoria|Clifton Hill]], [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]] and [[Coburg, Victoria|Coburg]], where the quarry used to source the stone for [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]] is now Coburg Lake.<ref>History of Brunswick, City of Moreland, http://moreland.vic.gov.au/moreland-libraries/services/local-history/history-brunswick.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110328164911/http://www.moreland.vic.gov.au/moreland-libraries/services/local-history/history-brunswick.html |date=2011-03-28 }}, accessed 11 September 2012</ref><ref>''Encyclopedia of Melbourne'': Quarries and Brickmaking, http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM01213b.htm, accessed 11 September 2012</ref> \nBluestone was also sourced in many other regions of the Victorian volcanic plains, and used in towns and cities of central and western regions, including [[Ballarat]], [[Geelong]], [[Kyneton]], [[Port Fairy]] and [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]]. It is still quarried at a number of places around the state.\n\nBluestone is very hard and therefore difficult to work, so it was predominantly used for warehouses, miscellaneous walls, and the foundations of buildings. However, a number of significant bluestone buildings exist, including the [[Old Melbourne Gaol]], [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Patrick's Cathedral]], [[Victoria Barracks, Melbourne|Victoria Barracks]], [[Melbourne Grammar School]], [[Deaf Children Australia]] and [[Victorian College for the Deaf]], [[Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind|Vision Australia]], the [[Goldsbrough Mort & Co|Goldsbrough Mort]] warehouses ([[Bourke Street, Melbourne|Bourke Street]]) and the [[Williamstown Lighthouse|Timeball Tower]], as well as [[St Mary of the Angels Basilica, Geelong|St Mary's Basilica]] in [[Geelong]]. Some examples of other major structures that use bluestone include [[Princes Bridge, Melbourne|Princes Bridge]], the adjacent Federation Wharf, and [[Hawthorn Bridge]]. Because of its distinctive qualities, post-modern Melbourne buildings have also made use of bluestone for nostalgic reasons. These include the Southgate complex and promenade in [[Southbank, Victoria]].\n\nBluestone was also used extensively as [[cobblestone]] and [https://bluestone-pavers.com.au/ bluestone pavers], and for kerbs and gutters, many examples which still exist in some of Melbourne's smaller city lanes and 19th century inner-suburban lanes. Crushed bluestone [[construction aggregate|aggregate]], known as \"blue metal\" (or \"bluemetal\"), is still used extensively in Victoria as railway [[track ballast|ballast]], as [[base course|road base]], and in making concrete. Combined with [[asphalt|bitumen]], it is used as a road surfacing material.\n\n===South Australia===\n[[Image:Bluestone33.jpg|thumb|right|Typical colouring caused by mineralisation in Adelaide bluestone]]\n\nIn [[South Australia]], the name bluestone is given to a form of slate which is much less durable than Victorian bluestone, but was valued for its decorative appearance.  The interior of the stone is usually pale grey or beige in colour, but is given attractively coloured surfaces by ferric oxide and other minerals deposited in joints and bedding planes.  The slate is laid in masonry with the mineralised surfaces exposed.  Bluestone was most popular from about the 1850s to the 1920s, quarried in the [[Adelaide Hills]] at [[Dry Creek, South Australia|Dry Creek]], [[O'Halloran Hill]] (formerly Tapley's Hill) and [[Glen Osmond]], and a number of other places in rural areas.<ref>R. Lockhart Jack, \"The Building Stones of South Australia\" (Adelaide 1923) pp. 18-28.</ref>\n\n===Tasmania===\nIn Tasmania, the name bluestone is given to dolerite (diabase), which is a dominant stone variety in the landscape, and used in a variety of building roles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Building Stone|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/B/Building%20stone.htm|website=Companion to Tasmanian History|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==New Zealand==\n[[File:Dunedin Station and Courts.jpg|thumb|right|Dunedin Railway Station and Law Courts, New Zealand, showing dark bluestone and creamy Oamaru stone construction]]\n[[Timaru]] bluestone is an attractive building material, used both historically and to the present. It is a grey basalt similar to Victorian bluestone, quarried near Timaru in the South Island. Bluestone from near Kokonga in [[Central Otago]] is also widely used, and is the main construction material (often with facing of [[Oamaru stone]], a local compact limestone) in many of the notable historic buildings in the southern South Island, most of which were constructed during the financial boom following the [[Otago Gold Rush|Central Otago gold rush]]. Prominent structures to use this combination include [[Otago University Registry Building]], [[Dunedin Law Courts]], and [[Dunedin Railway Station]]. Similar construction using Timaru bluestone was used for [[Christchurch Arts Centre]].\n\n==United States and Canada==\nThere are two distinct building materials called \"bluestone\" in the United States, one is also found in Canada.\n\nBluestone is quarried in western New Jersey, Pennsylvania and eastern New York.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2K8rqyKwUP8C&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=bluestone+is+a+feldspathic+%255B%255Bsandstone%255D%255D,+which+is+produced+in+hundreds+of+small+quarries+in+adjacent+areas+of+Pennsylvania+and+New+York#v=onepage&q=bluestone%2520is%2520a%2520feldspathic%2520%255B%255Bsandstone%255D%255D%252C%2520which%2520is%2520produced%2520in%2520hundreds%2520of%2520small%2520quarries%2520in%2520adjacent%2520areas%2520of%2520Pennsylvania%2520and%2520New%2520York&f=false |title=Architectural Stone: Fabrication, Installation, and Selection |last=Chacon |first=Mark A. |date=1999-10-11 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |language=en |access-date=2019-01-31|isbn=9780471246596 }}</ref> It is also quarried in the Canadian Appalachians near Deer Lake in Western Newfoundland.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nr.gov.nl.ca/nr/mines/geoscience/publications/of_nfld2865.pdf |title=Dimension Stone in Newfoundland and Labrador |last1=Evans |first1=DT |last2=Dickson |first2=WL |date=2004 |website=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador |access-date=25 January 2019}}</ref> The Pennsylvania Bluestone Association has 105 members, the vast majority of them quarriers.<ref name=SusCounty>{{cite web |url=http://susqco.com/economic-development/pennsylvania-bluestone/ |title=Susquehanna County: The Heart of Pennsylvania Bluestone |last= |first= |date= |website=Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania |access-date=25 January 2019}}</ref> Bluestone from [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] is sandstone defined as [[feldspath]]ic [[greywacke]].

It is a \"convenience\" label rather than a geological term, since at least 20 different rock types are represented. One of the most common rocks in the assemblage is known as Preseli Spotted Dolerite\u2014a chemically altered [[igneous rock]] containing spots or clusters of secondary minerals replacing [[plagioclase]] [[feldspar]]. It is a medium grained dark and heavy rock, harder than granite. Preseli bluestone tools, such as axes, have been discovered elsewhere within the British Isles. Many of them appear to have been made in or near Stonehenge, since there are petrographic similarities with some of the spotted [[dolerite]]s there. The bluestones at [[Stonehenge]] were placed there during the third phase of construction at Stonehenge around 2300 BC.<ref>{{cite web |last = Swaine| first =Jon| title =Stonehenge birthdate discovered by archaeologists| publisher =[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=2008-09-22| url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3046095/Stonehenge-birthdate-discovered-by-archaeologists.html | accessdate =2008-09-22}}</ref> It is assumed that there were about 80 of them originally, but this has never been proven since only 43 remain.

It was one of the favoured building materials during the [[Victorian Gold Rush]] period of the 1850s. In [[Melbourne]] it was extracted from quarries throughout the inner northern suburbs, such as [[Clifton Hill, Victoria|Clifton Hill]], [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]] and [[Coburg, Victoria|Coburg]], where the quarry used to source the stone for [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]] is now Coburg Lake.<ref>History of Brunswick, City of Moreland, http://moreland.vic.gov.au/moreland-libraries/services/local-history/history-brunswick.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110328164911/http://www.moreland.vic.gov.au/moreland-libraries/services/local-history/history-brunswick.html |date=2011-03-28 }}, accessed 11 September 2012</ref><ref>''Encyclopedia of Melbourne'': Quarries and Brickmaking, http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM01213b.htm, accessed 11 September 2012</ref> \nBluestone was also sourced in many other regions of the Victorian volcanic plains, and used in towns and cities of central and western regions, including [[Ballarat]], [[Geelong]], [[Kyneton]], [[Port Fairy]] and [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]]. It is still quarried at a number of places around the state.\n\nBluestone is very hard and therefore difficult to work, so it was predominantly used for warehouses, miscellaneous walls, and the foundations of buildings. However, a number of significant bluestone buildings exist, including the [[Old Melbourne Gaol]], [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Patrick's Cathedral]], [[Victoria Barracks, Melbourne|Victoria Barracks]], [[Melbourne Grammar School]], [[Deaf Children Australia]] and [[Victorian College for the Deaf]], [[Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind|Vision Australia]], the [[Goldsbrough Mort & Co|Goldsbrough Mort]] warehouses ([[Bourke Street, Melbourne|Bourke Street]]) and the [[Williamstown Lighthouse|Timeball Tower]], as well as [[St Mary of the Angels Basilica, Geelong|St Mary's Basilica]] in [[Geelong]]. Some examples of other major structures that use bluestone include [[Princes Bridge, Melbourne|Princes Bridge]], the adjacent Federation Wharf, and [[Hawthorn Bridge]]. Because of its distinctive qualities, post-modern Melbourne buildings have also made use of bluestone for nostalgic reasons. These include the Southgate complex and promenade in [[Southbank, Victoria]].\n\nBluestone was also used extensively as [[cobblestone]], and for kerbs and gutters, many examples which still exist in some of Melbourne's smaller city lanes and 19th century inner-suburban lanes. Crushed bluestone [[construction aggregate|aggregate]], known as \"blue metal\" (or \"bluemetal\"), is still used extensively in Victoria as railway [[track ballast|ballast]], as [[base course|road base]], and in making concrete. Combined with [[asphalt|bitumen]], it is used as a road surfacing material.\n\n===South Australia===\n[[Image:Bluestone33.jpg|thumb|right|Typical colouring caused by mineralisation in Adelaide bluestone]]\n\nIn [[South Australia]], the name bluestone is given to a form of slate which is much less durable than Victorian bluestone, but was valued for its decorative appearance.  The interior of the stone is usually pale grey or beige in colour, but is given attractively coloured surfaces by ferric oxide and other minerals deposited in joints and bedding planes.  The slate is laid in masonry with the mineralised surfaces exposed.  Bluestone was most popular from about the 1850s to the 1920s, quarried in the [[Adelaide Hills]] at [[Dry Creek, South Australia|Dry Creek]], [[O'Halloran Hill]] (formerly Tapley's Hill) and [[Glen Osmond]], and a number of other places in rural areas.<ref>R. Lockhart Jack, \"The Building Stones of South Australia\" (Adelaide 1923) pp. 18-28.</ref>\n\n===Tasmania===\nIn Tasmania, the name bluestone is given to dolerite (diabase), which is a dominant stone variety in the landscape, and used in a variety of building roles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Building Stone|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/B/Building%20stone.htm|website=Companion to Tasmanian History|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==New Zealand==\n[[File:Dunedin Station and Courts.jpg|thumb|right|Dunedin Railway Station and Law Courts, New Zealand, showing dark bluestone and creamy Oamaru stone construction]]\n[[Timaru]] bluestone is an attractive building material, used both historically and to the present. It is a grey basalt similar to Victorian bluestone, quarried near Timaru in the South Island. Bluestone from near Kokonga in [[Central Otago]] is also widely used, and is the main construction material (often with facing of [[Oamaru stone]], a local compact limestone) in many of the notable historic buildings in the southern South Island, most of which were constructed during the financial boom following the [[Otago Gold Rush|Central Otago gold rush]]. Prominent structures to use this combination include [[Otago University Registry Building]], [[Dunedin Law Courts]], and [[Dunedin Railway Station]]. Similar construction using Timaru bluestone was used for [[Christchurch Arts Centre]].\n\n==United States and Canada==\nThere are two distinct building materials called \"bluestone\" in the United States, one is also found in Canada.\n\nBluestone is quarried in western New Jersey, Pennsylvania and eastern New York.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2K8rqyKwUP8C&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=bluestone+is+a+feldspathic+%255B%255Bsandstone%255D%255D,+which+is+produced+in+hundreds+of+small+quarries+in+adjacent+areas+of+Pennsylvania+and+New+York#v=onepage&q=bluestone%2520is%2520a%2520feldspathic%2520%255B%255Bsandstone%255D%255D%252C%2520which%2520is%2520produced%2520in%2520hundreds%2520of%2520small%2520quarries%2520in%2520adjacent%2520areas%2520of%2520Pennsylvania%2520and%2520New%2520York&f=false |title=Architectural Stone: Fabrication, Installation, and Selection |last=Chacon |first=Mark A. |date=1999-10-11 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |language=en |access-date=2019-01-31|isbn=9780471246596 }}</ref> It is also quarried in the Canadian Appalachians near Deer Lake in Western Newfoundland.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nr.gov.nl.ca/nr/mines/geoscience/publications/of_nfld2865.pdf |title=Dimension Stone in Newfoundland and Labrador |last1=Evans |first1=DT |last2=Dickson |first2=WL |date=2004 |website=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador |access-date=25 January 2019}}</ref> The Pennsylvania Bluestone Association has 105 members, the vast majority of them quarriers.<ref name=SusCounty>{{cite web |url=http://susqco.com/economic-development/pennsylvania-bluestone/ |title=Susquehanna County: The Heart of Pennsylvania Bluestone |last= |first= |date= |website=Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania |access-date=25 January 2019}}</ref> Bluestone from [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] is sandstone defined as [[feldspath]]ic [[greywacke]].
