The album was mostly composed by guitarist [[Pete Townshend]], and is a [[rock opera]] that tells the story of Tommy Walker, a \"deaf, dumb and blind\" boy, including his experiences with life and his relationship with his family.\n\nTownshend came up with the concept of ''Tommy'' after being introduced to the work of [[Meher Baba]], and attempted to translate Baba's teachings into music. Recording on the album began in September 1968, but took six months to complete as material needed to be arranged and re-recorded in the studio. ''Tommy'' was acclaimed upon its release by critics, who hailed it as the Who's breakthrough. Its critical standing diminished slightly in later years; nonetheless, several writers view it as an important and influential album in the history of rock music. The Who promoted the album's release with an extensive tour, including a live version of ''Tommy'', which lasted throughout 1969 and 1970. Key gigs from the tour included appearances at [[Woodstock]], the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|1969 Isle of Wight Festival]], the [[University of Leeds]], the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]], and the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|1970 Isle of Wight Festival]]. The live performances of ''Tommy'' drew critical praise and rejuvenated the band's career.\n\nSubsequently, the rock opera developed into other media, including a [[Seattle Opera]] production in 1971, an orchestral version by [[Lou Reizner]] in 1972, a [[Tommy (1975 film)|film]] in 1975, and a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[The Who's Tommy|musical]] in 1992. The original album has sold 20 million copies and has been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]]. It has been reissued several times on CD, including a remix by [[Jon Astley]] in 1996, a deluxe [[Super Audio CD]] in 2003, and a super deluxe box set in 2013, including previously unreleased demos and live material.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Tommy'' has never had a definitive plot, but the following synopsis was published following the original album's release.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=121}}\n\nBritish Army Captain Walker goes missing during an expedition and is believed dead (\"Overture\"). His wife, Mrs. Walker, gives birth to their son, Tommy (\"It's a Boy\"). Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain murders this man in an [[altercation]]. Tommy's mother brainwashes him into believing he didn't see or hear anything, shutting down his senses and making him deaf, dumb and blind to the outside world (\"1921\"). Tommy now relies on his sense of touch and imagination, developing a fascinating inner [[psyche]] (\"[[Amazing Journey]]/Sparks\").{{sfn|Atkins|2000|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nA [[quackery|quack]] claims his wife can cure Tommy (\"[[Eyesight to the Blind|The Hawker]]\"), while Tommy's parents are increasingly frustrated that he will never find religion in the midst of his isolation (\"Christmas\"). They begin to neglect him, leaving him to be tortured by his [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] \"Cousin Kevin\" and [[child molestation|molested]] by his uncle Ernie (\"Fiddle About\"). The Hawker's drug addicted wife, \"[[The Acid Queen]]\", gives Tommy a dose of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], causing a [[Hallucinogen|hallucinogenic]] experience that is expressed musically (\"Underture\").{{sfn|Atkins|2000|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nAs Tommy grows older, he discovers that he can feel vibrations sufficiently well to become an expert [[pinball]] player (\"[[Pinball Wizard]]\"). His parents take him to a respected doctor (\"There's a Doctor\"), who determines that the boy's disabilities are [[Psychosomatic illness|psychosomatic]] rather than physical. Tommy is told by the Doctor to \"[[Go to the Mirror!]]\", and his parents notice he can stare at his reflection. After seeing Tommy spend extended periods staring at a mirror in the house, his mother smashes it out of frustration (\"Smash the Mirror\"). This removes Tommy's [[mental block]], and he recovers his senses, realising he can become a powerful leader (\"Sensation\"). He starts a religious movement (\"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\"), which generates fervor among its adherents (\"Sally Simpson\") and expands into a [[holiday camp]] (\"Welcome\" / \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\"). However, Tommy's followers ultimately reject his teachings and leave the camp (\"[[We're Not Gonna Take It (The Who song)|We're Not Gonna Take It]]\"). Tommy retreats inward again (\"[[See Me, Feel Me]]\") with his \"continuing statement of wonder at that which encompasses him\".{{sfn|Atkins|2000|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\n==Background==\nTownshend had been looking at ways of progressing beyond the standard three-minute pop single format since 1966.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=214}} Co-manager [[Kit Lambert]] shared Townshend's views and encouraged him to develop musical ideas,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=215}} coming up with the term \"[[rock opera]]\". The first use of the term was applied to a suite called \"Quads\", set in a future where parents could choose the sex of their children. A couple want four girls but instead receive three girls and a boy, raising him as a girl anyway. The opera was abandoned after writing a single song, the hit single, \"[[I'm a Boy]]\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=217}} When the Who's second album, ''[[A Quick One]]'' ran short of material during recording, Lambert suggested that Townshend should write a \"mini-opera\" to fill the gap. Townshend initially objected, but eventually agreed to do so, coming up with \"[[A Quick One, While He's Away]]\", which joined short pieces of music together into a continuous narrative.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=227}} During 1967, Townshend learned how to play the [[piano]] and began writing songs on it, taking his work more seriously.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=283}} That year's ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' included a mini-opera in the last track, \"Rael\", which like \"A Quick One...\" was a suite of musical segments joined together.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=282, 283}}\n\n{{quotebox|width=50%|quote=The package I hope is going to be called ''\"Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy.\"'' It's a story about a kid that's born deaf, dumb and blind and what happens to him throughout his life&nbsp;... But what it's really all about is the fact that&nbsp;... he's seeing things basically as vibrations which we translate as music. That's really what we want to do: create this feeling that when you listen to the music you can actually become aware of the boy, and aware of what he is all about, because we are creating him as we play.\"|source=[[Pete Townshend]] talking to [[Jann Wenner]], August 1968{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=313,314}}}}\n\nBy 1968, Townshend was unsure about how the Who should progress musically. The group were no longer teenagers, but he wanted their music to remain relevant.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=293\u2013294}} His friend, ''[[International Times]]'' [[art director]] Mike McInnerney, told him about the Indian spiritual mentor [[Meher Baba]],{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=294}} and Townshend became fascinated with Baba's values of compassion, love and introspection.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=296}} The Who's commercial success was on the wane after the single \"Dogs\" failed to make the top 20, and there was a genuine risk of the band breaking up.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=308}} The group still performed well live and spent most of the spring and summer touring the US and Canada,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=190}} but their stage act relied on Townshend smashing his guitar or [[Keith Moon]] demolishing his drums, which kept the group in debt. Townshend and Kit Lambert realised they needed a larger vehicle for their music than hit singles and a new stage show, and Townshend hoped to incorporate his love of Meher Baba into this concept.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=309}} He decided that the Who should record a series of songs that stood well in isolation, but formed a cohesive whole on the album. He also wanted the material performed in concert, to counteract the trend of bands like [[The Beatles]] and [[The Beach Boys]], whose studio output was not designed for live performance.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=310}}\n\nIn August 1968, in an interview to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Townshend talked about a new rock opera, which had the working title of ''Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy'', and described the entire plot in great detail, which ran to 11 pages.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=313\u2013316}} The Who biographer [[Dave Marsh]] subsequently said the interview described the narrative better than the finished album.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=316}} Townshend later regretted publishing so much detail, as he felt it forced him to write the album according to that blueprint.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=191}} The rest of the Who, however, were enthusiastic about the idea, and let him have artistic control over the project.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=192}}\n\n==Recording==\nThe Who started recording the album at [[IBC Studios]] on 19 September 1968.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=210}} There was no firm title at this point, which was variously referred to as ''Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy'', ''Amazing Journey'', ''Journey into Space'', ''The Brain Opera'' and ''Omnibus''. Townshend eventually settled on ''Tommy'' because it was a common British name, and a nickname for soldiers in [[World War I]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=317}} Kit Lambert took charge of the production, with Damon Lyon-Shaw as engineer. Sessions were block booked from 2pm \u2013 10pm, but recording often spilled over into the early morning. {{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=210}}\n\nThe album was recorded onto [[8-track tape|eight track tape]], which allowed various instruments to be [[overdubbed]]. Townshend used several guitars in the studio, but made particular use of the [[Gibson J-200]] acoustic and the [[Gibson SG]].<ref name=\"www2.gibson.com\">{{cite news |url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/pinball-wizard-0305-2012.aspx |work=Gibson Guitars |title=Pinball Wizard: Pete Townshend Finds His Signature Guitar Sound |first=Ted |last=Drozdowski |date=3 May 2012 |accessdate=9 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419095036/http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/pinball-wizard-0305-2012.aspx |archive-date=19 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As well as their usual instruments, Townshend played [[piano]] and [[Hammond organ|organ]] and bassist [[John Entwistle]] doubled on [[french horn]]. [[Keith Moon]] used a new double bass drum kit owned by roadie Tony Haslam, after [[Premier Percussion|Premier]] had refused to loan him any more equipment due to continual abuse.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=210}} Though Townshend wrote the majority of the material, the arrangements came from the entire band. Singer [[Roger Daltrey]] later said that Townshend often came in with a half-finished [[demo recording]], adding \"we probably did as much talking as we did recording, sorting out arrangements and things.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=219}} Townshend asked Entwistle to write two songs (\"Cousin Kevin\" and \"Fiddle About\") that covered the darker themes of bullying and abuse. \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\" was Keith Moon's suggestion of what kind of religious movement Tommy could lead. Moon got the songwriting credit for suggesting the idea, though the music was composed and played by Townshend.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=323}}  A significant amount of material had a lighter style than earlier recordings, with greater prominence put on the vocals. Moon later said, \"It was, at the time, very un-Wholike. A lot of the songs were soft. We never played like that.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=220}}\n\nSome of the material had already been written for other projects. \"Sensation\" was written about a girl Townshend had met on the Who's tour of Australia in early 1968, \"Welcome\" and \"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\" were about peace found through [[Meher Baba]] and \"Sally Simpson\" was based on a gig with [[the Doors]] which was marred by violence.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=316, 318}} Other songs had been previously recorded by the Who and were recycled; \"It's A Boy\" was derived from \"Glow Girl\", an out-take from [[The Who Sell Out|''The Who Sell Out'',]] while \"Sparks\" and \"Underture\" re-used and expanded one of the instrumental themes in \"Rael\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=318}} \"Amazing Journey\" was, according to Townshend, \"the absolute beginning\" of the opera and summarised the entire plot.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=318}} \"The Hawker\" was a cover of [[Sonny Boy Williamson]]'s \"Eyesight to the Blind\". A cover of [[Mercy Dee Walton]]'s \"One Room Country Shack\" was also recorded but was scrapped from the final track listing as Townshend could not figure out a way to incorporate it in the plot.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=114}}\n\nRecording at [[IBC Studios|IBC]] was slow, due to a lack of a full plot and a full selection of songs. The group hoped that the album would be ready by Christmas, but sessions dragged on. ''[[Melody Maker]]''{{'}}s [[Chris Welch]] visited IBC studios in November and while he was impressed with the working environment and the material,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=321}} the project still did not have a title and there was no coherent plotline.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=323}} The Who's US record company, [[Decca Records]], got so impatient waiting for new product that they released the compilation album ''[[Magic Bus: The Who on Tour]]'' which received a scathing review from Greil Marcus in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' over its poor selection of material and misleading name (as the album contained studio recordings and was not live).{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=319,320}}\n\nThe Who took a break from recording at the end of 1968 to tour, including a well received appearance at ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' on 10 December.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=216}} They resumed sessions at IBC in January 1969, block booking Monday to Thursday, but had to do gigs every weekend to stop going further into debt.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=324}} A major tour was booked for the end of April, and the group's management insisted that the album would have to be finished by then, as it had been well over a year since ''[[The Who Sell Out]]''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=325}} Kit Lambert wrote a script, ''Tommy (1914\u20131984)'' which he professionally printed, and gave copies to the band, which helped them focus the storyline, and also decide to make the album a double.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=324}} The group were still coming up with new material; Lambert insisted that the piece should have a proper overture,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=325}} while Townshend wrote \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" so that [[Nik Cohn]], a pinball fan, would give the album a favourable review in the ''[[New York Times]]''.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=221}} Lambert wanted an orchestra to appear on the album, but Townshend was strongly against the idea, and time and budget constraints meant it could not happen anyway.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=325}}\n\nBy March 1969, some songs had been recorded several times, yet Townshend still thought there were missing pieces.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=327}} [[John Entwistle]] had become fed up with recording, later saying \"we had to keep going back and rejuvenating the numbers&nbsp;... it just started to drive us mad.\"<ref name=\"www2.gibson.com\"/> The final recording session took place on 7 March, the same day that \"Pinball Wizard\" was released as a single.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|pp=227, 228}} The group started tour rehearsals and promotional activities for the single and Lambert went on holiday in [[Cairo]]. The mixing was left to Damon Lyon-Shaw and assistant engineer Ted Sharp, who did not think [[IBC Studios|IBC]] was well suited for the task.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=228}} The album overshot its April deadline, as stereo [[Mastering (audio)|mastering]] continued into the end of the month.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}}\n\n==Release and reception==\nAfter delays surrounding the cover artwork, ''Tommy'' was released on 17 May 1969 in the US by [[Decca Records|Decca]] and 23 May in the UK by [[Track Records]].<ref>{{harvnb|Neill|Kent|2002|p=232}}; {{harvnb|Atkins|2000|p=282}}.</ref> The original double album was configured with sides 1 and 4 on one disc, and sides 2 and 3 on the other, to accommodate [[record changers]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}}\n\nThe album was commercially successful, reaching No. 2 in the UK album charts, and No. 4 in the US.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=232}} It sold 200,000 copies in the first two weeks in the US alone, and was awarded a gold record for sales of 500,000 on August 18.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=340}}  \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\", \"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\" and \"[[See Me, Feel Me]]\" were released as singles and received airplay on the radio. \"Pinball Wizard\" reached the top 20 in the US and the top five in the UK. \"See Me, Feel Me\" reached the top 20 in the US and \"I'm Free\" reached the top 40. An [[Extended play|EP]] of selections from the album was planned to be released in the UK in November 1970, but was withdrawn.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=421}} As of 2012, ''Tommy'' has sold 20 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"www2.gibson.com\"/><ref name=\"Perry\"/>\n\nWhen it was released, critics were split between those who thought the album was a masterpiece, the beginnings of a new genre, and those that felt it was exploitative. The album had a hostile reception with the [[BBC]] and certain US radio stations, with [[Tony Blackburn]] describing \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" as \"distasteful\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}} Nevertheless, [[BBC Radio 1]] received an advance copy of the album at the start of May and gave the material its first airplay on [[Pete Drummond]]'s show on 3 May.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}} Townshend promoted the album's release with interviews in which he attempted to explain the plotline. Unfortunately, because it fundamentally dealt with the abstract concept of [[Meher Baba|Maher Baba]]'s spiritual precepts, the interviews often gave confusing and contradictory details.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=330}}\n\nFor ''[[Melody Maker]]'', [[Chris Welch]] went to the album's press launch show at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club|Ronnie Scott's]] and although the volume left his ears ringing for 20 hours, he concluded \"we wanted more.\" ''[[Disc and Music Echo]]'' ran a front-page headline saying \"Who's Tommy: A Masterpiece\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=340}} Critics and fans were confused by the storyline, but [[Kit Lambert]] pointed out this made ''Tommy'' no less confusing than the operas of [[Richard Wagner]] or [[Giacomo Puccini]] a century earlier.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=329}} In a 1969 column for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', music critic [[Robert Christgau]] said that, apart from the Mothers of Invention's ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'', ''Tommy'' is the first successful \"extended work\" in [[rock music]], but Townshend's parodic side is more \"profound and equivocal\" than [[Frank Zappa]]. He praised Townshend for deliberately constructing the album so that each song can be enjoyed individually and felt that he is determined to \"give his audience what it wants without burying his own peculiarity\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=12 June 1969|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/who-69.php|title=Whooopee!|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref> [[Albert Goldman]], writing in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, said that the Who play through \"all the kinky complications\" of the narrative in a [[hard rock]] style that is the antithesis of most contemporary \"serious\" rock.

instead was \"dominated by the Who's mature style: ponderous, rhythmically monotonous [[hard rock]]\".<ref name=\"Bayles\">{{cite

\"concoctions\" of the time because of the cultural climate during the late 1960s: \"''Tommy'' was considered more authentic, precisely because it consists of hard rock, rather than doctored-up [[Mussorgsky]]&nbsp;... and avoids the typical pseudoromantic themes of art rock (fairy-tale bliss and apocalyptic angst) in favor of the more up-to-date subject of [[popular culture]] itself.\"<ref

transitional material provided by the lyrics. There are no stage directions, no cast, and narration is restricted to key phrases (such as \"Tommy can you hear me?\"){{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=330}} Key problems included an unclear explanation of what Tommy didn't hear or see in \"1921\", how or why he plays pinball, why \"Smash the Mirror\" leads into \"I overwhelm as I approach you\" (the opening line in \"Sensation\"), why Tommy tells his followers in \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" they cannot drink or smoke but can play pinball, and what the \"you\" is in \"Listening to you, I get the music\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=332}}\n\n==Editions and cover art==\n\n===Original edition===\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = I liked the \u2018idea\u2019 of the Tommy character.

As recording was near completion, McInnerney received a number of cassettes with completed songs and a brief outline for the story, which he immediately recognised as being based on Baba's teachings.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=336}} He wanted to try and convey the world of a deaf, dumb and blind boy, and decided to \"depict a kind of breaking out of a certain restricted plane into freedom.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=337}} The finished cover contained a blue and white web of clouds, a fist punching into the black void to the left of it.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The inside cover depicts a wall with wall lights as a symbol of domestic space.

The group spent April 1969 rehearsing a live version of the show at the [[Hanwell Community Centre]] in [[Ealing]] including a final run down of the entire stage piece on 23 April.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}} The running order was changed, and four songs (\"Cousin Kevin\", \"Underture\", \"Sensation\" and \"Welcome\") were dropped entirely.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=136}} Townshend later said the group \"did the whole thing from start to finish and ''that'' was when we first realized we had something cohesive and playable.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=339}} Roger Daltrey's voice had improved substantially since the group's early tours, and they realised their new live act could completely change their career.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}}\n\nAfter a few warm up gigs towards the end of April,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}} the group gave a preview concert to the press at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club]], London on 1 May. Realising the opera's narrative was difficult to understand, Townshend explained a synopsis of the story, before the Who played ''Tommy'' all the way through at full stage volume.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=340}} The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the [[Grande Ballroom]], [[Detroit]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}} At the end of May, the group played four nights at the [[Kinetic Playground]], [[Chicago]], and they noticed the audience would all stand up at the same time, and stay standing. This indicated that live performances of ''Tommy'' had a significant positive response.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=343}}\n\nThe group continued to play large halls in the US, organised by tour promoter [[Frank Barsalona]], and generally avoided festivals,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=346}} but made an important exception with the [[Woodstock]] festival on 16 August. After spending all night arguing with Barsalona, the band agreed to perform at Woodstock for $12,500.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=348}} The festival ran late and the Who did not take to the stage until the early morning of 17 August. During \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\", [[Abbie Hoffman]] took to the stage to protest about the imprisonment of [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]] before being kicked offstage by Townshend, while during \"[[See Me, Feel Me]]\", the sun rose, almost as if on cue.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=350}} Two weeks later, the group played the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|second Isle of Wight Festival]], using one of the largest live [[Public address system|PAs]] available.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|pp=239}} Though media attention was on [[Bob Dylan]] playing his first major live concert since 1966, the Who stole the show. Townshend later said, \"We know that the stage act we had, with ''Tommy'' in it, would work under any circumstances, because it had worked many times on tour.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=240}}\n\n[[File:Metropolitan Opera 2.jpg|thumb|By 1970, ''Tommy'' had achieved sufficient critical acclaim to be performed live in the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]].]]\n''Tommy'' remained in the Who's live set through the rest of the year and into 1970. In October 1969, the Who played six shows at the [[Fillmore East]], where [[Leonard Bernstein]] praised them for their new music.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|pp=241\u2013242}} The group's show on 14 December at the [[London Coliseum]] was filmed for a possible future ''Tommy'' feature.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=243}} Lambert was keen for ''Tommy'' to be taken seriously and wanted the Who to perform at [[opera house]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bill Graham Presents: My Life Inside Rock and Out|first=Bill|last=Graham|first2=Robert|last2=greenfield|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1922|p=321|isbn=978-0-306-81349-8}}</ref> In June 1970, the group performed two shows at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]], which was the first time Townshend announced the show as being the \"last ''Tommy'' ever\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=353}} The group made a second trip to the Isle of Wight, appearing at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|1970 festival]] on 29 August, before an audience of 600,000.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=136}} The last live performance for 1970 was at [[The Roundhouse]], London on 20 December. Townshend said \"This is the very last time we'll play ''Tommy'' on stage\", to which Keith Moon promptly cried, \"Thank Christ for that!\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=271}}\n\nPublic reaction to the Who's concerts that included ''Tommy'' was overwhelmingly positive. The touring helped keep the album in the public eye, and cleared the band's debts.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=137}} Several live recordings of ''Tommy'' from the Who's 1969\u201370 tours have been released. A complete performance is available on the 2002 ''Deluxe Edition'' of the live album ''[[Live at Leeds]]'', recorded on 14 February 1970. The second Isle of Wight performance is available on ''Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970'', released in 1996.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=136}} The Coliseum Theatre gig is available on the 2007 video release ''[[At Kilburn 1977 + Live at the Coliseum]]''.

Recordings from this tour can be found on the ''[[Join Together (1990 album)|Join Together]]'' live album and the ''[[Tommy and Quadrophenia Live]]'' [[DVD]].

Russell insisted on having a known cast, though Townshend wanted people who could sing the material, and was particularly disappointed at not being allowed to cast [[Stevie Wonder]] as the Pinball Wizard.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=440}} In several cinemas, the film supported a [[multitrack recording|multi-track]] soundtrack billed as [[Tommy (1975 film)#Quintaphonic Sound|quintaphonic sound]], which placed speaker banks in the four quadrants of the house and directly behind the centre of the screen.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=369}}\n\nTownshend also oversaw the production of a [[Tommy (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]], on which the unrecorded orchestral arrangements Kit Lambert had envisaged for the original ''Tommy'' LP were realised by the extensive use of [[synthesizer]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=442}} He started work on the soundtrack album immediately after the Who's 1973 US tour in December, and worked on it almost continuously for the next four months.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=440}} As well as the Who, the film's music track and the original soundtrack LP also employed several session musicians including [[Caleb Quaye]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Nicky Hopkins]], [[Chris Stainton]], and longtime Who associate [[John Bundrick|John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=441}} Due to Keith Moon's commitments with the filming of ''[[Stardust (1974 film)|Stardust]]'', [[Kenney Jones]] (who would take over as the Who's drummer after Moon's death in 1978) played drums on much of the soundtrack album.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=344}}\n\n\"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" was a major hit when released as a single. This sequence in the film depicts [[Elton John]] being backed by the Who (dressed in pound-note suits); the band portrayed the Pinball Wizard's band for filming,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=350}} but on the music track and soundtrack album, the music was performed entirely by him and his regular touring band.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=441}} Most of the extras were students at [[University of Portsmouth|Portsmouth Polytechnic]] and were paid with tickets to a Who concert after filming wrapped.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=353}}\n\nThe film and its soundtrack album featured six new songs, all written by Townshend, and an alteration to the running order compared to the original album. The CD reissue of the film soundtrack also included an additional Overture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tommy-original-soundtrack-mw0000313332|title=Tommy (Original Soundtrack)|website=AllMusic|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Broadway musical===\n{{Main|The Who's Tommy}}\nIn 1991, Townshend broke his wrist in a cycling accident and could not play guitar. Looking for alternative work while recuperating, he responded to a request from the PACE Theatrical Group for the rights to a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]] adaptation of ''Tommy''. The group introduced him to [[La Jolla Playhouse]] director [[Des McAnuff]], and the pair began to develop the musical together. It opened at La Jolla in summer 1992, and was an immediate commercial success.{{sfn|Wollman|2006|p=161}} Townshend wrote a new song, \"I Believe My Own Eyes\", to explain the relationship between Tommy's parents, but otherwise tried to be faithful to the music on the original album.{{sfn|Wollman|2006|p=165}}\n\nThe musical had a mixed response from critics,{{sfn|Wollman|2006|p=168}} while Roger Daltrey and John Entwistle thought the show was too passive.{{sfn|Wollman|2006|p=165}} Anthony DeCurtis, writing in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', said the orchestra drummer had \"the thankless task of having to reproduce Keith Moon's parts\".{{sfn|Wollman|2006|p=169}} Townshend and Des McAnuff rewrote parts of the musical when it moved from La Jolla to [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], to show a darker side for the title character.{{sfn|Wollman|2006|p=166}} McAnuff won a [[Tony Award]] in 1993 for Best Director, while [[Wayne Cilento]] won the award for Best Choreographer.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the American Musical Theatre: No Business Like It|first=Nathan|last=Hurwitz|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|p=225|isbn=978-1-317-91205-7}}</ref> The Broadway run lasted from 1993 to 1995.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bad Music: The Music We Love to Hate|editor1-first=Christopher|editor1-last=Washburne|editor2-first=Maiken|editor2-last=Derno|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|p=314|isbn=978-1-135-38547-7}}</ref> McAnuff revisited Tommy during the 2013 season of the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/OnStage/productions.aspx?id=20233&prodid=47004 |title=Tommy |publisher=Stratford Festival |accessdate=13 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313051240/http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/OnStage/productions.aspx?id=20233&prodid=47004 |archivedate=13 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Bluegrass===\nIn 2015, [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band the Hillbenders released a cover of the album, arranged by Jim Rea and produced by Louis Jay Meyers.

The album was mostly composed by guitarist [[Pete Townshend]], and is a [[rock opera]] that tells the story of Tommy Walker, a \"deaf, dumb and blind\" boy, including his experiences with life and his relationship with his family.\n\nTownshend came up with the concept of ''Tommy'' after being introduced to the work of [[Meher Baba]], and attempted to translate Baba's teachings into music. Recording on the album began in September 1968, but took six months to complete as material needed to be arranged and re-recorded in the studio. ''Tommy'' was acclaimed upon its release by critics, who hailed it as the Who's breakthrough. Its critical standing diminished slightly in later years; nonetheless, several writers view it as an important and influential album in the history of rock music. The Who promoted the album's release with an extensive tour, including a live version of ''Tommy'', which lasted throughout 1969 and 1970. Key gigs from the tour included appearances at [[Woodstock]], the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|1969 Isle of Wight Festival]], the [[University of Leeds]], the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]], and the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|1970 Isle of Wight Festival]]. The live performances of ''Tommy'' drew critical praise and rejuvenated the band's career.\n\nSubsequently, the rock opera developed into other media, including a [[Seattle Opera]] production in 1971, an orchestral version by [[Lou Reizner]] in 1972, a [[Tommy (1975 film)|film]] in 1975, and a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[The Who's Tommy|musical]] in 1992. The original album has sold 20 million copies and has been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]]. It has been reissued several times on CD, including a remix by [[Jon Astley]] in 1996, a deluxe [[Super Audio CD]] in 2003, and a super deluxe box set in 2013, including previously unreleased demos and live material.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Tommy'' has never had a definitive plot, but the following synopsis was published following the original album's release.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=121}}\n\nBritish Army Captain Walker goes missing during an expedition and is believed dead (\"Overture\"). His wife, Mrs. Walker, gives birth to their son, Tommy (\"It's a Boy\"). Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain murders this man in an [[altercation]]. Tommy's mother brainwashes him into believing he didn't see or hear anything, shutting down his senses and making him deaf, dumb and blind to the outside world (\"1921\"). Tommy now relies on his sense of touch and imagination, developing a fascinating inner [[psyche]] (\"[[Amazing Journey]]/Sparks\").{{sfn|Atkins|2000|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nA [[quackery|quack]] claims his wife can cure Tommy (\"[[Eyesight to the Blind|The Hawker]]\"), while Tommy's parents are increasingly frustrated that he will never find religion in the midst of his isolation (\"Christmas\"). They begin to neglect him, leaving him to be tortured by his [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] \"Cousin Kevin\" and [[child molestation|molested]] by his uncle Ernie (\"Fiddle About\"). The Hawker's drug addicted wife, \"[[The Acid Queen]]\", gives Tommy a dose of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], causing a [[Hallucinogen|hallucinogenic]] experience that is expressed musically (\"Underture\").{{sfn|Atkins|2000|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nAs Tommy grows older, he discovers that he can feel vibrations sufficiently well to become an expert [[pinball]] player (\"[[Pinball Wizard]]\"). His parents take him to a respected doctor (\"There's a Doctor\"), who determines that the boy's disabilities are [[Psychosomatic Illness|psychosomatic]] rather than physical. Tommy is told by the Doctor to \"[[Go to the Mirror!]]\", and his parents notice he can stare at his reflection. After seeing Tommy spend extended periods staring at a mirror in the house, his mother smashes it out of frustration (\"Smash the Mirror\"). This removes Tommy's [[mental block]], and he recovers his senses, realising he can become a powerful leader (\"Sensation\"). He starts a religious movement (\"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\"), which generates fervor among its adherents (\"Sally Simpson\") and expands into a [[holiday camp]] (\"Welcome\" / \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\"). However, Tommy's followers ultimately reject his teachings and leave the camp (\"[[We're Not Gonna Take It (The Who song)|We're Not Gonna Take It]]\"). Tommy retreats inward again (\"[[See Me, Feel Me]]\") with his \"continuing statement of wonder at that which encompasses him\".{{sfn|Atkins|2000|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\n==Background==\nTownshend had been looking at ways of progressing beyond the standard three-minute pop single format since 1966.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=214}} Co-manager [[Kit Lambert]] shared Townshend's views and encouraged him to develop musical ideas,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=215}} coming up with the term \"[[rock opera]]\". The first use of the term was applied to a suite called \"Quads\", set in a future where parents could choose the sex of their children. A couple want four girls but instead receive three girls and a boy, raising him as a girl anyway. The opera was abandoned after writing a single song, the hit single, \"[[I'm a Boy]]\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=217}} When the Who's second album, ''[[A Quick One]]'' ran short of material during recording, Lambert suggested that Townshend should write a \"mini-opera\" to fill the gap. Townshend initially objected, but eventually agreed to do so, coming up with \"[[A Quick One, While He's Away]]\", which joined short pieces of music together into a continuous narrative.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=227}} During 1967, Townshend learned how to play the [[piano]] and began writing songs on it, taking his work more seriously.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=283}} That year's ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' included a mini-opera in the last track, \"Rael\", which like \"A Quick One...\" was a suite of musical segments joined together.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=282, 283}}\n\n{{quotebox|width=50%|quote=The package I hope is going to be called ''\"Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy.\"'' It's a story about a kid that's born deaf, dumb and blind and what happens to him throughout his life&nbsp;... But what it's really all about is the fact that&nbsp;... he's seeing things basically as vibrations which we translate as music. That's really what we want to do: create this feeling that when you listen to the music you can actually become aware of the boy, and aware of what he is all about, because we are creating him as we play.\"|source=[[Pete Townshend]] talking to [[Jann Wenner]], August 1968{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=313,314}}}}\n\nBy 1968, Townshend was unsure about how the Who should progress musically. The group were no longer teenagers, but he wanted their music to remain relevant.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=293\u2013294}} His friend, ''[[International Times]]'' [[art director]] Mike McInnerney, told him about the Indian spiritual mentor [[Meher Baba]],{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=294}} and Townshend became fascinated with Baba's values of compassion, love and introspection.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=296}} The Who's commercial success was on the wane after the single \"Dogs\" failed to make the top 20, and there was a genuine risk of the band breaking up.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=308}} The group still performed well live and spent most of the spring and summer touring the US and Canada,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=190}} but their stage act relied on Townshend smashing his guitar or [[Keith Moon]] demolishing his drums, which kept the group in debt. Townshend and Kit Lambert realised they needed a larger vehicle for their music than hit singles and a new stage show, and Townshend hoped to incorporate his love of Meher Baba into this concept.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=309}} He decided that the Who should record a series of songs that stood well in isolation, but formed a cohesive whole on the album. He also wanted the material performed in concert, to counteract the trend of bands like [[The Beatles]] and [[The Beach Boys]], whose studio output was not designed for live performance.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=310}}\n\nIn August 1968, in an interview to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Townshend talked about a new rock opera, which had the working title of ''Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy'', and described the entire plot in great detail, which ran to 11 pages.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=313\u2013316}} The Who biographer [[Dave Marsh]] subsequently said the interview described the narrative better than the finished album.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=316}} Townshend later regretted publishing so much detail, as he felt it forced him to write the album according to that blueprint.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=191}} The rest of the Who, however, were enthusiastic about the idea, and let him have artistic control over the project.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=192}}\n\n==Recording==\nThe Who started recording the album at [[IBC Studios]] on 19 September 1968.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=210}} There was no firm title at this point, which was variously referred to as ''Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy'', ''Amazing Journey'', ''Journey into Space'', ''The Brain Opera'' and ''Omnibus''. Townshend eventually settled on ''Tommy'' because it was a common British name, and a nickname for soldiers in [[World War I]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=317}} Kit Lambert took charge of the production, with Damon Lyon-Shaw as engineer. Sessions were block booked from 2pm \u2013 10pm, but recording often spilled over into the early morning. {{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=210}}\n\nThe album was recorded onto [[8-track tape|eight track tape]], which allowed various instruments to be [[overdubbed]]. Townshend used several guitars in the studio, but made particular use of the [[Gibson J-200]] acoustic and the [[Gibson SG]].<ref name=\"www2.gibson.com\">{{cite news |url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/pinball-wizard-0305-2012.aspx |work=Gibson Guitars |title=Pinball Wizard: Pete Townshend Finds His Signature Guitar Sound |first=Ted |last=Drozdowski |date=3 May 2012 |accessdate=9 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419095036/http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/pinball-wizard-0305-2012.aspx |archive-date=19 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As well as their usual instruments, Townshend played [[piano]] and [[Hammond organ|organ]] and bassist [[John Entwistle]] doubled on [[french horn]]. [[Keith Moon]] used a new double bass drum kit owned by roadie Tony Haslam, after [[Premier Percussion|Premier]] had refused to loan him any more equipment due to continual abuse.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=210}} Though Townshend wrote the majority of the material, the arrangements came from the entire band. Singer [[Roger Daltrey]] later said that Townshend often came in with a half-finished [[demo recording]], adding \"we probably did as much talking as we did recording, sorting out arrangements and things.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=219}} Townshend asked Entwistle to write two songs (\"Cousin Kevin\" and \"Fiddle About\") that covered the darker themes of bullying and abuse. \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\" was Keith Moon's suggestion of what kind of religious movement Tommy could lead. Moon got the songwriting credit for suggesting the idea, though the music was composed and played by Townshend.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=323}}  A significant amount of material had a lighter style than earlier recordings, with greater prominence put on the vocals. Moon later said, \"It was, at the time, very un-Wholike. A lot of the songs were soft. We never played like that.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=220}}\n\nSome of the material had already been written for other projects. \"Sensation\" was written about a girl Townshend had met on the Who's tour of Australia in early 1968, \"Welcome\" and \"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\" were about peace found through [[Meher Baba]] and \"Sally Simpson\" was based on a gig with [[the Doors]] which was marred by violence.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=316, 318}} Other songs had been previously recorded by the Who and were recycled; \"It's A Boy\" was derived from \"Glow Girl\", an out-take from [[The Who Sell Out|''The Who Sell Out'',]] while \"Sparks\" and \"Underture\" re-used and expanded one of the instrumental themes in \"Rael\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=318}} \"Amazing Journey\" was, according to Townshend, \"the absolute beginning\" of the opera and summarised the entire plot.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=318}} \"The Hawker\" was a cover of [[Sonny Boy Williamson]]'s \"Eyesight to the Blind\". A cover of [[Mercy Dee Walton]]'s \"One Room Country Shack\" was also recorded but was scrapped from the final track listing as Townshend could not figure out a way to incorporate it in the plot.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=114}}\n\nRecording at [[IBC Studios|IBC]] was slow, due to a lack of a full plot and a full selection of songs. The group hoped that the album would be ready by Christmas, but sessions dragged on. ''[[Melody Maker]]''{{'}}s [[Chris Welch]] visited IBC studios in November and while he was impressed with the working environment and the material,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=321}} the project still did not have a title and there was no coherent plotline.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=323}} The Who's US record company, [[Decca Records]], got so impatient waiting for new product that they released the compilation album ''[[Magic Bus: The Who on Tour]]'' which received a scathing review from Greil Marcus in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' over its poor selection of material and misleading name (as the album contained studio recordings and was not live).{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=319,320}}\n\nThe Who took a break from recording at the end of 1968 to tour, including a well received appearance at ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' on 10 December.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=216}} They resumed sessions at IBC in January 1969, block booking Monday to Thursday, but had to do gigs every weekend to stop going further into debt.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=324}} A major tour was booked for the end of April, and the group's management insisted that the album would have to be finished by then, as it had been well over a year since ''[[The Who Sell Out]]''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=325}} Kit Lambert wrote a script, ''Tommy (1914\u20131984)'' which he professionally printed, and gave copies to the band, which helped them focus the storyline, and also decide to make the album a double.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=324}} The group were still coming up with new material; Lambert insisted that the piece should have a proper overture,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=325}} while Townshend wrote \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" so that [[Nik Cohn]], a pinball fan, would give the album a favourable review in the ''[[New York Times]]''.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=221}} Lambert wanted an orchestra to appear on the album, but Townshend was strongly against the idea, and time and budget constraints meant it could not happen anyway.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=325}}\n\nBy March 1969, some songs had been recorded several times, yet Townshend still thought there were missing pieces.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=327}} [[John Entwistle]] had become fed up with recording, later saying \"we had to keep going back and rejuvenating the numbers&nbsp;... it just started to drive us mad.\"<ref name=\"www2.gibson.com\"/> The final recording session took place on 7 March, the same day that \"Pinball Wizard\" was released as a single.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|pp=227, 228}} The group started tour rehearsals and promotional activities for the single and Lambert went on holiday in [[Cairo]]. The mixing was left to Damon Lyon-Shaw and assistant engineer Ted Sharp, who did not think [[IBC Studios|IBC]] was well suited for the task.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=228}} The album overshot its April deadline, as stereo [[Mastering (audio)|mastering]] continued into the end of the month.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}}\n\n==Release and reception==\nAfter delays surrounding the cover artwork, ''Tommy'' was released on 17 May 1969 in the US by [[Decca Records|Decca]] and 23 May in the UK by [[Track Records]].<ref>{{harvnb|Neill|Kent|2002|p=232}}; {{harvnb|Atkins|2000|p=282}}.</ref> The original double album was configured with sides 1 and 4 on one disc, and sides 2 and 3 on the other, to accommodate [[record changers]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}}\n\nThe album was commercially successful, reaching No. 2 in the UK album charts, and No. 4 in the US.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=232}} It sold 200,000 copies in the first two weeks in the US alone, and was awarded a gold record for sales of 500,000 on August 18.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=340}}  \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\", \"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\" and \"[[See Me, Feel Me]]\" were released as singles and received airplay on the radio. \"Pinball Wizard\" reached the top 20 in the US and the top five in the UK. \"See Me, Feel Me\" reached the top 20 in the US and \"I'm Free\" reached the top 40. An [[Extended play|EP]] of selections from the album was planned to be released in the UK in November 1970, but was withdrawn.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=421}} As of 2012, ''Tommy'' has sold 20 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"www2.gibson.com\"/><ref name=\"Perry\"/>\n\nWhen it was released, critics were split between those who thought the album was a masterpiece, the beginnings of a new genre, and those that felt it was exploitative. The album had a hostile reception with the [[BBC]] and certain US radio stations, with [[Tony Blackburn]] describing \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" as \"distasteful\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}} Nevertheless, [[BBC Radio 1]] received an advance copy of the album at the start of May and gave the material its first airplay on [[Pete Drummond]]'s show on 3 May.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}} Townshend promoted the album's release with interviews in which he attempted to explain the plotline. Unfortunately, because it fundamentally dealt with the abstract concept of [[Meher Baba|Maher Baba]]'s spiritual precepts, the interviews often gave confusing and contradictory details.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=330}}\n\nFor ''[[Melody Maker]]'', [[Chris Welch]] went to the album's press launch show at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club|Ronnie Scott's]] and although the volume left his ears ringing for 20 hours, he concluded \"we wanted more.\" ''[[Disc and Music Echo]]'' ran a front-page headline saying \"Who's Tommy: A Masterpiece\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=340}} Critics and fans were confused by the storyline, but [[Kit Lambert]] pointed out this made ''Tommy'' no less confusing than the operas of [[Richard Wagner]] or [[Giacomo Puccini]] a century earlier.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=329}} In a 1969 column for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', music critic [[Robert Christgau]] said that, apart from the Mothers of Invention's ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'', ''Tommy'' is the first successful \"extended work\" in [[rock music]], but Townshend's parodic side is more \"profound and equivocal\" than [[Frank Zappa]]. He praised Townshend for deliberately constructing the album so that each song can be enjoyed individually and felt that he is determined to \"give his audience what it wants without burying his own peculiarity\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=12 June 1969|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/who-69.php|title=Whooopee!|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref> [[Albert Goldman]], writing in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, said that the Who play through \"all the kinky complications\" of the narrative in a [[hard rock]] style that is the antithesis of most contemporary \"serious\" rock.

instead was \"dominated by the Who's mature style: ponderous, rhythmically monotonous [[hard rock]]\".<ref name=\"Bayles\">{{cite

\"concoctions\" of the time because of the cultural climate during the late 1960s: \"''Tommy'' was considered more authentic, precisely because it consists of hard rock, rather than doctored-up [[Mussorgsky]]&nbsp;... and avoids the typical pseudoromantic themes of art rock (fairy-tale bliss and apocalyptic angst) in favor of the more up-to-date subject of [[popular culture]] itself.\"<ref

transitional material provided by the lyrics. There are no stage directions, no cast, and narration is restricted to key phrases (such as \"Tommy can you hear me?\"){{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=330}} Key problems included an unclear explanation of what Tommy didn't hear or see in \"1921\", how or why he plays pinball, why \"Smash the Mirror\" leads into \"I overwhelm as I approach you\" (the opening line in \"Sensation\"), why Tommy tells his followers in \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" they cannot drink or smoke but can play pinball, and what the \"you\" is in \"Listening to you, I get the music\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=332}}\n\n==Editions and cover art==\n\n===Original edition===\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = I liked the \u2018idea\u2019 of the Tommy character.

As recording was near completion, McInnerney received a number of cassettes with completed songs and a brief outline for the story, which he immediately recognised as being based on Baba's teachings.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=336}} He wanted to try and convey the world of a deaf, dumb and blind boy, and decided to \"depict a kind of breaking out of a certain restricted plane into freedom.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=337}} The finished cover contained a blue and white web of clouds, a fist punching into the black void to the left of it.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The inside cover depicts a wall with wall lights as a symbol of domestic space.

The group spent April 1969 rehearsing a live version of the show at the [[Hanwell Community Centre]] in [[Ealing]] including a final run down of the entire stage piece on 23 April.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}} The running order was changed, and four songs (\"Cousin Kevin\", \"Underture\", \"Sensation\" and \"Welcome\") were dropped entirely.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=136}} Townshend later said the group \"did the whole thing from start to finish and ''that'' was when we first realized we had something cohesive and playable.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=339}} Roger Daltrey's voice had improved substantially since the group's early tours, and they realised their new live act could completely change their career.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}}\n\nAfter a few warm up gigs towards the end of April,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}} the group gave a preview concert to the press at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club]], London on 1 May. Realising the opera's narrative was difficult to understand, Townshend explained a synopsis of the story, before the Who played ''Tommy'' all the way through at full stage volume.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=340}} The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the [[Grande Ballroom]], [[Detroit]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}} At the end of May, the group played four nights at the [[Kinetic Playground]], [[Chicago]], and they noticed the audience would all stand up at the same time, and stay standing. This indicated that live performances of ''Tommy'' had a significant positive response.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=343}}\n\nThe group continued to play large halls in the US, organised by tour promoter [[Frank Barsalona]], and generally avoided festivals,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=346}} but made an important exception with the [[Woodstock]] festival on 16 August. After spending all night arguing with Barsalona, the band agreed to perform at Woodstock for $12,500.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=348}} The festival ran late and the Who did not take to the stage until the early morning of 17 August. During \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\", [[Abbie Hoffman]] took to the stage to protest about the imprisonment of [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]] before being kicked offstage by Townshend, while during \"[[See Me, Feel Me]]\", the sun rose, almost as if on cue.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=350}} Two weeks later, the group played the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|second Isle of Wight Festival]], using one of the largest live [[Public address system|PAs]] available.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|pp=239}} Though media attention was on [[Bob Dylan]] playing his first major live concert since 1966, the Who stole the show. Townshend later said, \"We know that the stage act we had, with ''Tommy'' in it, would work under any circumstances, because it had worked many times on tour.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=240}}\n\n[[File:Metropolitan Opera 2.jpg|thumb|By 1970, ''Tommy'' had achieved sufficient critical acclaim to be performed live in the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]].]]\n''Tommy'' remained in the Who's live set through the rest of the year and into 1970.

Townshend said \"This is the very last time we'll play ''Tommy'' on stage\", to which Keith Moon promptly cried, \"Thank Christ for that!\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=271}}\n\nPublic reaction to the Who's concerts that included ''Tommy'' was overwhelmingly positive. The touring helped keep the album in the public eye, and cleared the band's debts.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=137}} Several live recordings of ''Tommy'' from the Who's 1969\u201370 tours have been released. A complete performance is available on the 2002 ''Deluxe Edition'' of the live album ''[[Live at Leeds]]'', recorded on 14 February 1970. The second Isle of Wight performance is available on ''Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970'', released in 1996.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=136}} The Coliseum Theatre gig is available on the 2007 video release ''[[At Kilburn 1977 + Live at the Coliseum]]''.

Recordings from this tour can be found on the ''[[Join Together (1990 album)|Join Together]]'' live album and the ''[[Tommy and Quadrophenia Live]]'' [[DVD]].

This sequence in the film depicts [[Elton John]] being backed by the Who (dressed in pound-note suits); the band portrayed the Pinball Wizard's band for filming,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=350}} but on the music track and soundtrack album, the music was performed entirely by him and his regular touring band.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=441}} Most of the extras were students at [[University of Portsmouth|Portsmouth Polytechnic]] and were paid with tickets to a Who concert after filming wrapped.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=353}}\n\nThe film and its soundtrack album featured six new songs, all written by Townshend, and an alteration to the running order compared to the original album. The CD reissue of the film soundtrack also included an additional Overture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tommy-original-soundtrack-mw0000313332|title=Tommy (Original Soundtrack)|website=AllMusic|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Broadway musical===\n{{Main|The Who's Tommy}}\nIn 1991, Townshend broke his wrist in a cycling accident and could not play guitar. Looking for alternative work while recuperating, he responded to a request from the PACE Theatrical Group for the rights to a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway musical]] adaptation of ''Tommy''. The group introduced him to [[La Jolla Playhouse]] director [[Des McAnuff]], and the pair began to develop the musical together. It opened at La Jolla in summer 1992, and was an immediate commercial success.{{sfn|Wollman|2006|p=161}} Townshend wrote a new song, \"I Believe My Own Eyes\", to explain the relationship between Tommy's parents, but otherwise tried to be faithful to the music on the original album.{{sfn|Wollman|2006|p=165}}\n\nThe musical had a mixed response from critics,{{sfn|Wollman|2006|p=168}} while Roger Daltrey and John Entwistle thought the show was too passive.{{sfn|Wollman|2006|p=165}} Anthony DeCurtis, writing in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', said the orchestra drummer had \"the thankless task of having to reproduce Keith Moon's parts\".{{sfn|Wollman|2006|p=169}} Townshend and Des McAnuff rewrote parts of the musical when it moved from La Jolla to [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], to show a darker side for the title character.{{sfn|Wollman|2006|p=166}} McAnuff won a [[Tony Award]] in 1993 for Best Director, while [[Wayne Cilento]] won the award for Best Choreographer.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the American Musical Theatre: No Business Like It|first=Nathan|last=Hurwitz|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|p=225|isbn=978-1-317-91205-7}}</ref> The Broadway run lasted from 1993 to 1995.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bad Music: The Music We Love to Hate|editor1-first=Christopher|editor1-last=Washburne|editor2-first=Maiken|editor2-last=Derno|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|p=314|isbn=978-1-135-38547-7}}</ref> McAnuff revisited Tommy during the 2013 season of the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/OnStage/productions.aspx?id=20233&prodid=47004 |title=Tommy |publisher=Stratford Festival |accessdate=13 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313051240/http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/OnStage/productions.aspx?id=20233&prodid=47004 |archivedate=13 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Bluegrass===\nIn 2015, [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band the Hillbenders released a cover of the album, arranged by Jim Rea and produced by Louis Jay Meyers.

{"title_page": "Decolonization of the Americas", "text_new": "{{short description|Process by which the countries in the Americas gained their independence from European rule}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2007}}\n{{Euromericas}}\n\n'''Decolonization of the Americas''' refers to thek \n   process by which the countries in the [[Americas]] gained their independence from [[Europe]]an rule. The [[American Revolution]] was the first in the Americas, and the British defeat in the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783) was a surprising victory against a [[great power]]. The [[French Revolution]] in Europe followed, and collectively these events had  profound effects on the [[British Empire|British]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], and [[French colonial empire|French]] colonies in the Americas. A [[revolutionary wave]] followed, resulting in the creation of a number of independent countries in [[Latin America]]. The [[Haitian Revolution]] lasted from 1791 to 1804 and resulted in the independence of the French slave colony. The [[Peninsular War]] with France, which resulted from the [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Napoleonic occupation of Spain]], caused [[Criollo people|Spanish Creole]]s in Spanish America to question their allegiance to Spain, stoking independence movements that culminated in various [[Spanish American wars of independence]], which lasted almost two decades. At the same time, the Portuguese monarchy relocated to [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] during Portugal's French occupation. After the royal court returned to [[Lisbon]], the [[prince regent]], [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]], remained in Brazil and in 1822 successfully declared himself emperor of a newly independent Brazil.  \n\nSpain would lose all three of its remaining Caribbean colonies by the end of the 1800s.  [[Dominican Republic|Santo Domingo]] declared independence in 1821 as the [[Republic of Spanish Haiti]]. After [[Unification of Hispaniola|unification]] and then [[Dominican War of Independence|split]] from the former French colony of Haiti, the President of the Dominican Republic signed an agreement that revert the country to a Spanish colony in 1861. This triggered the [[Dominican Restoration War]], which resulted in the Dominican Republic's second independence from Spain in 1865. Cuba fought for independence from Spain in the [[Ten Years' War]] (1868\u20131878) and [[Little War (Cuba)|Little War]] (1879-1880) and finally the [[Cuban War of Independence]] (1895\u201398). American intervention in 1898 became the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and resulted in the United States gaining [[Puerto Rico]] (which is still a U.S. territory), [[Guam]] and the [[Philippine Islands]] in the Pacific Ocean. Under military occupation, Cuba became a U.S. protectorate until its dependence in 1902.\n\nPeaceful independence by voluntary withdrawal of colonial powers then became the norm in the second half of the 20th century. However, there are still many British and Dutch colonies in North America (mostly Caribbean islands), and France has fully integrated most of its former colonies as fully constituent [[Departments of France|departments]] of France.\n\n==Conditions prior to revolution==\n\n===Undermining of metropolitan authority===\n[[File:America 1794.png|thumb|210px|Political map of the Americas in 1794]]\nDuring the 18th century, Spain recovered much of the strength it had lost in the 17th century but the country's resources were under strain because of the incessant warfare in Europe from 1793. This led to an increased local participation in the financing of defense and an increased participation in militias by the locally born. Such development was at odds with the ideals of the centralized [[absolute monarchy]]. The Spanish also made formal concessions to strengthen defense; In [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago|Chilo\u00e9]], Spanish authorities promised freedom from the Encomienda for indigenous locals who settled near the new stronghold of [[Ancud]] (founded in 1768) and contributed to its defense. The increased local organization of the defenses would ultimately undermine metropolitan authority and bolster the independence movement.<ref name=Ossa2010>{{cite journal |last=Ossa Santa Cruz |first=Juan Luis |date=2010 |title=La criollizaci\u00f3n de un ej\u00e9rcito perif\u00e9rico, Chile, 1768 to 1810 |url=http://revistahistoria.uc.cl/estudios/2247/ |journal=[[Historia (history of the Americas journal)|Historia]] |publisher= |volume=42 |issue=II |pages=413\u2013448 |doi= |access-date=27 January 2016 |language=Spanish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201133624/http://revistahistoria.uc.cl/estudios/2247/ |archive-date=2016-02-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Napoleonic Wars===\n{{main|Napoleonic Wars|Peninsular War}}\nThe Napoleonic Wars were a series of wars fought between [[First French Empire|France]] (led by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]) and alliances involving Britain, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] at different times, from 1799 to 1815.\n\nIn the case of Spain and its colonies, in May 1808, Napoleon captured Carlos IV and King Fernando VII and installed his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish Throne because he did not want anyone outside of his own bloodline to rule Spain. This  event disrupted the political stability of Spain and broke the link with some of the colonies which were loyal to the Bourbon Dynasty. The local elites, the creoles, took matters into their own hands organizing themselves into ''juntas'' to take \"in absence of the king, Fernando VII, their sovereignty devolved temporarily back to the community\". The juntas swore loyalty to the captive Fernando VII and each ruled different and diverse parts of the colony. Most of Fernando's subjects were loyal to him in 1808, but after he was restored to the Spanish crown in 1814, his policy of restoring absolute power alienated both the juntas and his subjects. He abrogated the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Cadiz Constitution of 1812]] and persecuted anyone who had supported it. The violence used by royalist forces and the prospect of being ruled by Fernando shifted the majority of the colonist population in favor of separation from Spain.<ref>Chambers, Sarah C., and John Charles Chasteen. ''Latin American Independence: An Anthology of Sources''. Indianapolis: Hackett Pub., 2010.</ref> The local elites reacted to absolutism in much the same way that the British colonial elites, Tory and Whig alike, had reacted to London's interference before 1775.\n\n===Spanish military presence in its colonies===\n[[Image:Royalist Hispanic American.png|thumb|200px|left|Graphs showing the make-up of the royalist army at the time of the revolution.]]\n\nThe colonial army of the Spanish Empire in Americas was made up of local American and European supporters of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand]]. The Royalists were made up of a cross-section of society loyal to the crown with Americans composing the majority of the royalist forces on all fronts. There were two types of military units: from the regular Spanish army which were sent out or formed with local Europeans and called Expidicionarios and units called veterans or [[militia]]s created in the Americas. The militias included some veteran units and were called the disciplined militia. Only 11% of the personnel in the militias were European or American whites. After [[Rafael del Riego]]'s revolution in 1820 no more Spanish soldiers were sent to the wars in the Americas. In 1820 there were only 10,000 soldiers in Royal Army in Colombia and Venezuela, and Spaniards formed only 10% of all the royalist armies, and only half of the soldiers of the expeditionary units were European. By the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] in 1824, less than 1% of the soldiers were European.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Other factors===\n{{Main|Enlightenment Spain|Bourbon Reforms}}\n[[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]] spurred the desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout the Americas and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and [[Physiocrats|physiocratic]] [[economics]] were raised by the Enlightenment.\n\nIndependence movements in South America can be traced back to slave revolts in plantations in the northernmost part of the continent and Caribbean. In 1791, a [[Haitian Revolution|massive slave revolt]] sparked a general insurrection against the plantation system and French colonial power.<ref name=\"BBC_Haiti\">{{cite web |date=April 29, 2009|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1202857.stm|title = Timeline: Haiti |publisher = [[BBC News]]| accessdate = 2009-04-30 | last= |quote=}}</ref> These events were followed by a violent uprising led by [[Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Chirino]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Caridad Gonz\u00e1lez]] that sprung up in 1795 Venezuela, allegedly inspired by the revolution in Haiti.\n\nToussaint L'Ouverture was born a slave in Saint-Domingue where he developed labor skills that would give him higher privileges than other slaves. He intellectually and physically advanced resulting in promotion, land of his own, and owning slaves. In 1791, slaves in Haiti formed a revolution to seek independence from their French owners. L'Ouverture joined the rebellion as a top military official with the intention to abolish slavery without complete independence. However, through a series of letters written by Toussaint, it became clear that he grew open to equal human rights for all that live in Haiti. Similar to  how the United States Constitution was ratified, the enlightenment ideas of equality and representation of the people created an impact of change against the status quo that sparked the revolution. The letter details the great concerns he felt due to a conservative shift in France's legislature after the revolution in 1797. The greatest fear was that these conservative values could give ideas to the French Government to bring back slavery. The enlightenment has proven to forever change the way a captive society thinks after L'Ouverture refuses to let the French send him and his people back into slavery. \"[W]hen finally the rule of law took the place of anarchy under which the unfortunate colony had too long suffered, what fatality can have led the greatest enemy of its prosperity and our happiness still to dare to threaten us with the return of slavery?\" Ultimately, slavery was abolished from French colonies in 1794 and Haiti declared Independence from France in 1804.<ref>Toussaint L'Ouverture, \"Letter to the French Directory, 1797\", in Nicola Foote, ''Sources for Latin America in the Modern World''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2018.</ref>\n\n==United States==\n{{main|American Revolution|History of United States continental expansion}}\nThe [[United States|United States of America]] declared independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] on July 4, 1776, thus becoming the first independent, foreign-recognized nation in the Americas and the first European colonial entity to break from its mother country. Britain formally acknowledged American independence in 1783 after its defeat in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The U.S. victory encouraged independent movements in other parts of the Americas.\n\nAlthough initially occupying only the land east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] between Canada and Florida, the United States would later eventually [[Territorial evolution of the United States|acquire various other North American territories]] from the [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[Russian Empire|Russian]]s in succeeding years, effectively decolonizing these areas formerly under European control.\n\n==Haiti and the French Antilles==\n{{Main|Haitian Revolution|Latin American wars of independence}}\nThe [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s had profound effects on the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] colonies in the Americas. [[Haiti]], a French slave colony, was the first to follow the United States to independence, during the [[Haitian Revolution]], which lasted from 1791 to 1804. Thwarted in his attempt to rebuild a French empire in North America, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] sold [[Louisiana Purchase|Louisiana]] to the United States and from then on focused on the European theater, marking the end of France's ambitions of building a colonial empire in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n== Spanish America ==\n[[File:Americas independence map.PNG|thumb|Places in the Americas by date of independence.{{contradict inline|section=Timeline|article=Decolonization of the Americas|reason=Date of Mexican Independence 1820 or 1821?|date=April 2020}} Note that the United States did not complete its continental territorial expansion until 1867; Canada did not complete sovereignty as an independent country until 1982.]]\n[[File:South America 1799.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Intendant (government official)|Intendecies]] (provinces) of the South American viceroyalties.]]\n{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence}}\n{{further|Libertadores}}\n\nThe Spanish Kingdoms in the Americas won their independence in the first quarter of the 19th century.\n\nDuring the [[Peninsular War]], Napoleon installed his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish Throne and captured the King Fernando VII. The crisis of political legitimacy sparked reaction in Spain's overseas empire. Several assemblies were established after 1810 by the ''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|Criollos]]'' (Latin Americans who are of full or near full Spanish descent) to recover sovereignty and self-government based on the [[Siete Partidas|Castilian law]] and to rule American lands in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]].\n\nThis experience of self-government, along with the influence of [[Liberalism]] and the ideas of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution]]s, brought about a struggle for independence, led by the ''[[Libertadores]]''. The territories freed themselves, often with help from foreign mercenaries and privateers. United States, Europe and the [[British Empire]] were neutral, aimed to achieve political influence and trade without the Spanish monopoly.\n\nIn [[South America]], [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] led the final phase of the independence struggle. Although Bol\u00edvar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of the continent politically unified, they rapidly became independent of one another as well, and several further wars were fought, such as the [[Paraguayan War]] and the [[War of the Pacific]].\n\nA related process took place in what is now Mexico, Central America, and parts of North America between 1810 and 1821 with the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. Independence was achieved in 1821 by a coalition uniting under [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] and the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]]. Unity was maintained for a short period under the [[First Mexican Empire]], but within a decade the region fought against the United States over the border lands (losing bordering lands of California and Texas). Most of the heat was during the official [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican-American War]] from 1846 to 1848.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Mexican-American-War|title=Mexican-American War {{!}} Mexico-United States [1846-1848]|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, in the [[Greater Antilles]], the [[United States]] won the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and occupied [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]], ending Spanish territorial control in the Americas.\n\n===Argentina===\n{{main|Argentine War of Independence}}\n\nAfter the defeat of Spain in the [[Peninsular War]] and the abdication [[King Ferdinand VII]], the Spanish colonial government of the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], present-day [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Uruguay]], became greatly weakened. Without a rightful king in the Spanish throne to render the office of the Viceroy as legitimate, the right of [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros|Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros]] to govern came under fire. The local elites, tired of the Spanish trade restrictions and taxes, seized the opportunity and during the [[May Revolution]] of 1810, removed Cisneros and created the first local government, the [[Primera Junta]].\n\n[[Image:Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn (retrato, c.1828).jpg|thumb|upright|Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]]\n\nFollowing a half a decade of battles and skirmishes with provincial royalist forces within the former Vice-royalty along with military expeditions across the Andes to [[Chile]], [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] led by [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|General Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] to finally end Spanish rule in America, a formal declaration was signed on July 9, 1816 by an assembly in [[San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n]], declaring full independence with provisions for a national constitution. [[Constitution of Argentina of 1853|The Argentine Constitution]] was signed in 1853, declaring the creation of the [[Argentine Republic]].\n\n===Bolivia===\n{{main|Bolivian War of Independence}}\n\nFollowing upheaval caused by the [[May Revolution]], along with the independence movements in [[Chilean independence|Chile]] and [[Venezuelan Independence War|Venezuela]], local struggle for independence kicked off with two failed revolutions that. Over sixteen years of struggle followed before the first steps towards the establishment of a republic were taken.\n\nFormally, it is considered that the fight for independence culminated in the [[Battle of Ayacucho]], on December 9, 1824.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[Image:Non-Native American Nations Control over South America 1700 and on.gif|thumb|upright|Retreat of European colonialism and change of political borders in South America, 1700\u2013present]]\n\n===Colombia===\n[[Image:Battle-of-Boyaca.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Battle of Boyac\u00e1 sealed Colombia's independence]]\n{{main|Patria Boba|Spanish reconquest of New Granada|Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada}}\n\n===Chile===\n{{main|Chilean War of Independence}}\n\nThe Chilean Independence campaign was led by the Liberator General Jose de San Martin with the support of Chilean exiles such as Bernardo O'Higgins. The local independence movement was composed of Chilean-born criollos, who sought political and economic independence from Spain. The movement for independence was far from gaining unanimous support among Chileans, who became divided between independentists and royalists. What started as an elitist political movement against their colonial master, finally ended as a full-fledged civil war. Traditionally, the process is divided into three stages: [[Patria Vieja]], [[Reconquista (Chile)|Reconquista]], and [[Patria Nueva (Chile)|Patria Nueva]].\n\n===Ecuador===\n{{main|Ecuadorian War of Independence}}\nThe first uprising against Spanish rule took place in 1809, and criollos in Ecuador set up a junta on September 22, 1810 to rule in the name of the Bourbon monarch; but as elsewhere, it allowed assertion of their own power.<ref>David Bushnell, ''Wars of Independence: South America\", in ''The Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 5, p. 447.

The Spanish defeat guaranteed the liberation of Ecuador.\n\n===Guatemala===\nWhen Mexico achieved its independence in 1821 with the Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba, the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] that had ruled Central America became politically independent as well, without the necessity of violent struggle. Guatemala declared its own independence September 15, 1821, likely to prevent the Mexican [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] from \"liberating\" Guatemala and over-riding nascent local autonomy. However, Guatemala chose to be annexed to the [[First Mexican Empire]], led by royalist-turned-insurgent military leader Agust\u00edn de Iturbide, who was proclaimed emperor of Mexico in 1822. When Iturbide abdicated from the monarchy and Mexico took steps to be a republic, Central America claimed its independence.<ref>Ralph Lee Woodward, ''Central America: A Nation Divided''. 2nd edition. New York: Oxford University Press 1985, pp. 85&ndash;90.</ref>\n\n===Mexico===\n{{main|Mexican War of Independence}}\nIndependence in Mexico was a protracted struggle from 1808 until the fall of royal government in 1821 and the establishment of independent Mexico. In the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], as elsewhere in Spanish America in 1808, reacted to the unexpected French invasion of the Iberian peninsula and the ouster of the Bourbon king, replaced by [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. Local American-born Spaniards saw the opportunity to seize control from Viceroy [[Jos\u00e9 de Iturrigaray]] who may well have been sympathetic to creoles aspirations. Iturrigaray was ousted by pro-royalists. A few from among the creole elites sought independence, including [[Juan Aldama]], and [[Ignacio Allende]], and the secular parish priest [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]. Hidalgo made a proclamation in his home parish of Dolores, which was not recorded in writing at the time, but denounced bad government and ''gachupines'' (pejorative for peninsular-born Spaniards), and declared independence. The unorganized hordes following Hidalgo wrought destruction on property and the lives of whites in the region of the Baj\u00edo. Hidalgo was caught, defrocked, and executed in 1811, along with Allende. Their heads remained on display until 1821. His former student [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]] continued the rebellion and was himself caught and killed in 1815. The struggle of Mexican insurgents continued under the leadership of [[Vicente Guerrero]] and [[Guadalupe Victoria]]. From 1815 to 1820 there was a stalemate in New Spain, with royalist forces unable to defeat the insurgents and the insurgents unable to expand beyond their narrow territory in the southern region. Again, events in Spain intervened, with an uprising of military men against Ferdinand VII and the restoration of the liberal [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], which mandated a constitutional monarchy and curtailed the power of the Roman Catholic Church. The monarch had repudiated the constitution once the Spanish monarchy was restored in 1814.  For conservatives in New Spain, these changed political circumstances threatened the institutions of church and state. Royal military officer [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] seized the opportunity to lead, making an alliance with his former enemy Guerrero. Iturbide proclaimed the [[Plan de Iguala]], which called for independence, equality of peninsular and American-born Spaniards, and a monarchy with a prince from Spain as king. He persuaded the insurgent Guerrero to form an alliance with him and creating the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]]. Crown rule in New Spain collapsed when the incoming Viceroy [[Juan O'Donoj\u00fa]] signed the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] recognizing Mexico's sovereignty. With no European monarch presenting himself for the crown of Mexico, Iturbide himself was proclaimed emperor Agustin I in 1822. He was overthrown in 1823 and Mexico was established as a republic. Decades of political and economic instability ensued which resulted in a decline in population.\n\n===Paraguay===\n[[Paraguay]] [[History of Paraguay#Independence of 1811|gained its independence]] on the night of May 14 and the morning of May 15, 1811, after a plan organized by various pro-independence nationalists including [[Fulgencio Yegros]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]].\n\n===Peru===\n{{main|Peruvian War of Independence}}\n[[File:La Independencia del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]]'s proclamation of the independence of [[Peru]] on 28 July 1821 in [[Lima]]]]\nSpain initially had the support of the Lima oligarchs because of their opposition to the commercial interests of Buenos Aires and Chile. Therefore, the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] became the last redoubt of the Spanish Monarchy in South America. Nevertheless, a Creole rebellion arose in 1812 in [[Hu\u00e1nuco]] and another in [[Cusco]] between 1814 and 1816. Both were suppressed. These rebellions were supported by the armies of Buenos Aires.\n\nPeru finally succumbed after the decisive continental campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn (1820\u20131823) and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (1824). While San Martin was in charge of the land campaign, a newly built Chilean Navy led by [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]] transported the fighting troops and launched a sea campaign against the Spanish fleet in the Pacific. San Mart\u00edn, who had displaced the royalists of Chile after the [[Battle of Maip\u00fa]], and who had disembarked in [[Paracas Peninsula|Paracas]] in 1820, proclaimed the independence of Peru in Lima on July 28, 1821. Four years later, the Spanish Monarchy was defeated definitively at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] in late 1824.\n\nAfter independence, the conflicts of interests that faced different sectors of Creole Peruvian society and the particular ambitions of the [[caudillo]]s, made the organization of the country excessively difficult.

The Republic of Bolivia was created from Upper Peru. In 1837 a [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] was also created but was dissolved two years later due to Chilean military intervention.\n\n===Uruguay===\nFollowing the events of the [[May Revolution]], in 1811 [[Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas]], led a successful revolt against the Spanish forces in the Provincia Oriental, now Uruguay, joining the independentist movement that was taking place in the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] at the time. In 1821, the Provincia Oriental was invaded by Portugal, trying to annex it into Brazil under the name of Prov\u00edncia Cisplatina.\n\nThe former Vice-royalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, [[United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata|The United Provinces of the River Plate]], fought back Brazil in a war that lasted over 2 years, eventually turning into a stalemate. The Brazilian forces withdrew with the United Provinces keeping them at bay but failing to win any decisive victory. With neither side gained the upper hand and the economic burden of the war crippling the United Provinces economy, the [[1828 Treaty of Montevideo|Treaty of Montevideo was signed in 1828]], fostered by Britain, declaring Uruguay as an independent state.<ref>Nilton Freixinho, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20141103172023/http://131.137.250.135/dhh-dhp/his/docs/Coll_21st_Peacekeeping.pdf#page=614 International Relations in South America Nineteenth Century A Case Study: The Independence and Sovereignty of Uruguay]\", in ''Peacekeeping 1815 to Today'' (1995) pp 612\u2013619; {{ISBN|0-662-62062-3}}</ref>\n\n===Venezuela===\n{{main|Venezuelan War of Independence|First Republic of Venezuela|Second Republic of Venezuela}}\n[[Image:Simon Bolivar.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]\n\nAccording to the ''Encyclopedia Americana'' of 1865, General Francisco de Miranda, already a hero to the French, Prussians, English and Americans had garnered a series of successes against the Spanish between 1808 and 1812. He had effectively negated their access to all the ports on the Caribbean, thus preventing them from receiving reinforcements and supplies and was essentially conducting mopping-up operations throughout the country. At that point he convinced Simon Bol\u00edvar to join the struggle and put him in charge of the fort at Puerto Cabello. This was all at once a supply and arms depot, a strategic port and the central holding facility for Spanish prisoners. Through what amounts to a gross dereliction of duty, Simon Bol\u00edvar neglected to enforce the customary security dispositions before departing to a social event. During the night there was an uprising of the Spanish prisoners and they managed to subdue the Independentist garrison and gain control of the supplies, the arms and ammunition, and the port. The Loyalist forces progressively regained control of the country and eventually Monteverde's successes forced the newly formed congress of the republic to ask of Miranda that he sign a capitulation at La Victoria in Aragua, on July 12, 1812, thus ending the first phase of the revolutionary war.\n\nAfter the capitulation of 1812, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] turned over Francisco de Miranda to the Spanish authorities, secured a safe passage for himself and his closest officers and fled to [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]]. He later returned with a new army, while the war had entered a tremendously violent phase. After much of the local aristocracy had abandoned the cause of independence, blacks and mulattoes carried on the struggle. Elites reacted with open distrust and opposition to the efforts of these common people. Bol\u00edvar's forces [[Admirable Campaign|invaded Venezuela from New Granada]] in 1813, waging a campaign with a ferocity captured perfectly by their motto of \"[[Decree of War to the Death|war to the death]]\". Bol\u00edvar's forces defeated Domingo Monteverde's Spanish army in a series of battles, taking [[Caracas]] on August 6, 1813 and besieging Monteverde at [[Puerto Cabello]] in September 1813.\n\n[[File:BatallaCarabobo01.JPG|thumb|right|Battle of Carabobo]]\n\nWith loyalists displaying the same passion and violence, the rebels achieved only short-lived victories. The army led by the loyalist [[Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Boves]] demonstrated the key military role that the ''[[Llanero]]s'' came to play in the region's struggle. Turning the tide against independence, these highly mobile, ferocious fighters made up a formidable military force that pushed Bol\u00edvar out of his home country once more. In 1814, heavily reinforced Spanish forces in Venezuela lost a series of battles to Bol\u00edvar's forces but then decisively defeated Bolivar at La Puerta on June 15, took Caracas on July 16, and again defeated his army at [[Aragua de Matur\u00edn|Aragua]] on August 18, at a cost of 2,000 Spanish casualties out of 10,000 soldiers as well as most of the 3,000 in the rebel army. Bol\u00edvar and other leaders then returned to New Granada. Later that year the largest expeditionary force ever sent by Spain to America arrived under the command of [[Pablo Morillo]]. This force effectively replaced the improvised llanero units, who were [[Military discharge|disbanded]] by Morillo.\n\nBol\u00edvar and other republican leaders returned to Venezuela in December 1816, leading a largely unsuccessful insurrection against Spain from 1816 to 1818 from bases in the [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]] and [[Ciudad Bol\u00edvar]] in the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]] area.\n\nIn 1819 Bol\u00edvar successfully invaded New Granada, and returned to Venezuela in April 1821, leading a large army of 7,000. At [[Battle of Carabobo|Carabobo]] on June 24, his forces decisively defeated Spanish and colonial forces, winning Venezuelan independence, although hostilities continued.\n\n==Brazil==\n{{main|Independence of Brazil}}\n[[File:Independencia brasil 001.jpg|thumb|Prince [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] after giving the news of the Brazilian independence on 7 September 1822]]\nUnlike the Spanish, the Portuguese did not divide their colonial territory in the Americas. The captaincies they created were subdued to a centralized administration in Salvador which reported directly to the Crown in Lisbon. Therefore, it is not common to refer to \"Portuguese America\" (like Spanish America, Dutch America, etc.), but rather to Brazil, as a unified colony since its very beginnings.\n\nAs a result, Brazil did not split into several states by the time of independence (1822), as happened to its Spanish-speaking neighbors. The adoption of monarchy instead of federal republic in the first six decades of Brazilian political sovereignty also contributed to the nation's unity.\n\nAfter several failed revolts, in the Portuguese colony [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese [[monarch|king]] [[Dom Jo\u00e3o VI]], proclaimed the country's independence in 1822 and became Brazil's first [[Emperor]]. This began when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] forced the Portuguese court out of their capital city of Lisbon and into exile in Brazil. Over the next eight years the capital of the Portuguese empire would be located in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In 1815, after Lisbon was reclaimed from the French by the Portuguese, King Dom Jo\u00e3o VI declared that Rio and Lisbon would become equal centers of the empire. King Jo\u00e3o VI was forced back to Lisbon in 1821 by the Portuguese Cortes, but left his son Dom Pedro behind to run Rio. A year later, Dom Pedro declared independence for Brazil and officially became emperor Pedro I. Brazil's independence was met with little resistance from Portugal, and they were officially recognized by their former colonial overlords in 1825. \n<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |first1=Teresa |title=A History of Modern Latin America |date=2016 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |location=West Sussex, UK |isbn=9781118772485 |pages=70 |edition=Second}}</ref>\n\n==Canada==\n{{main|Canadian Confederation}}\n[[Canada]]'s transition from colonial rule to independence occurred gradually over many decades and was achieved mostly through political means, as opposed to the violent revolutions that marked the end of colonialism in other North and South American countries. Attempts at revolting against the British, such as the [[Rebellion of 1837]], were brief and quickly put down. Canada was declared a dominion within the British Empire in 1867. Originally, the Canadian Confederation included just a few of what are now Canada's eastern provinces; other British colonies in modern-day Canada, such as [[British Columbia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Newfoundland]], would join later. Additionally, Britain's and Norway's claims to Arctic lands were ceded to Canada in the late 19th and early 20th century. By 1931, the United Kingdom had relinquished its control over Canada's foreign policy. What few political links that remained between Canada and the UK were formally severed in 1982 with the [[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]].\n\n==20th century==\nOther countries did not gain independence until the 20th century:\n\nFrom the United Kingdom:\n* [[Jamaica]]: from the [[United Kingdom]], in 1962\n* [[Trinidad and Tobago]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1962\n* [[Guyana]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1966.\n* [[Barbados]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1966\n* [[Bahamas]]: Granted internal self-government in 1964 and, then achieved full independence from the United Kingdom in 1973.\n* [[Grenada]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1974\n* [[Dominica]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1978\n* [[Saint Lucia]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1979\n* [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1979\n* [[Antigua and Barbuda]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1981\n* [[Belize]] (formerly British Honduras): from the United Kingdom, in 1981\n* [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1983\n\nFrom the Netherlands:\n* [[Suriname]]: from [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], in 1975\n\n==Current non-sovereign territories==\nSome parts of the Americas are still administered by European countries or the United States:\n* [[Anguilla]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[Aruba]] (Netherlands)\n* [[Bermuda]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[Bonaire]] (Netherlands)\n* [[British Virgin Islands]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[Cayman Islands]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[Curacao]] (Netherlands)\n* [[Falkland Islands]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[French Guiana]] (France)\n* [[Greenland]] (Kingdom of Denmark)\n* [[Guadeloupe]] (France)\n* [[Martinique]] (France)\n* [[Montserrat]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[Puerto Rico]] (United States)\n* [[Saba]] (Netherlands)\n* [[Saint Barthelemy]] (France)\n* [[Saint Martin (France)|Saint Martin]] (France)\n* [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]] (France)\n* [[Sint Eustatius]] (Netherlands)\n* [[Sint Marteen]] (Netherlands)\n* [[South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] (United States)\n\nSome of the remaining non-sovereign territories of the Americas have retained this status by choice, and enjoy a significant degree of self-government. (Some have nevertheless been placed on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories#Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea|U.N. list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], an ongoing subject of controversy.) Aruba, for example, seceded from the Netherlands Antilles on January 1, 1986, and became a separate, self-governing member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Movement toward full independence by 1996 was halted at Aruba's request in 1990. [[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]] are not considered [[dependent territories]] of [[France]], but have been \"incorporated\" into France itself, as overseas ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partements]]'' (''[[d\u00e9partements d'outre-mer]], or DOM''). Other regions however have had or currently have movements to change their political status, for example different movements to change the [[political status of Puerto Rico]] and intermittent calls for independence in other non-sovereign territories such as [[Martinican Independence Movement|Martinique]] and others, with differing amounts of support.\n\n==Timeline==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

This measure ostensibly was taken in order to safeguard the newfound liberties of these new countries, but it was also taken as a precautionary measure against the intrusion of European states.{{Citation needed| reason = This is the authors opinion, which can be contested with the premise that the doctrine was aimed to conquer Mexico. |date=October 2014}} Since the United States was a newly founded nation, it lacked the capacity to prevent other European powers from interfering, for that the United States looked for Britain's help and support to execute the Monroe Doctrine into action.\n\nGreat Britain's trade with Latin America greatly expanded during the revolutionary period, which until then was restricted due to Spanish [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] trade policies. British pressure was sufficient to prevent Spain from attempting any serious reassertion of its control over its lost colonies.\n\n===Attempts at hemispheric unity===\n{{main|Latin American integration}}\n\nThe notion of closer Spanish American cooperation and unity was first put forward by the Liberator [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] who, at the 1826 [[Congress of Panama]], proposed the creation a league of American republics, with a common military, a mutual defense pact, and a supranational parliamentary assembly. This meeting was attended by representatives of [[Great Colombia|Gran Colombia]] (comprising the modern-day nations of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela), [[Peru]], the [[United Provinces of Central America]] ([[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]]), and [[Mexico]].  Nevertheless, the great distances and geographical barriers, not to mention the different national and regional interests, made union impossible.\n\nSixty-three years later the Commercial Bureau of the American Republics was established. It was renamed the International Commercial Bureau at the Second International Conference of 1901\u20131902. These two bodies, in existence as of 14 April 1890, represent the point of inception of today's [[Organization of American States]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Colonialism]]\n* [[Decolonization]]\n* [[Wars of national liberation]]\n* [[Predecessors of sovereign states in South America]]\n* [[Creole nationalism]]\n* [[Spanish Empire]]\n* [[Libertadores]]\n* [[Spanish reconquest of Mexico]]\n* [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Spanish American Royalists]]\n* [[Wars of national liberation]]\n* [[History of Central America]]\n* [[History of South America]]\n* [[History of Cuba]]\n* [[History of the Dominican Republic]]\n* [[History of Puerto Rico]]\n* [[Age of Revolution]]\n* [[Territorial evolution of the Caribbean]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Andrien, Kenneth J. and Lyman, L.

The [[American Revolution]] was the first in the Americas, and the British defeat in the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783) was a surprising victory against a [[great power]]. The [[French Revolution]] in Europe followed, and collectively these events had  profound effects on the [[British Empire|British]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], and [[French colonial empire|French]] colonies in the Americas. A [[revolutionary wave]] followed, resulting in the creation of a number of independent countries in [[Latin America]]. The [[Haitian Revolution]] lasted from 1791 to 1804 and resulted in the independence of the French slave colony. The [[Peninsular War]] with France, which resulted from the [[Kingdom of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte|Napoleonic occupation of Spain]], caused [[Criollo people|Spanish Creole]]s in Spanish America to question their allegiance to Spain, stoking independence movements that culminated in various [[Spanish American wars of independence]], which lasted almost two decades. At the same time, the Portuguese monarchy relocated to [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] during Portugal's French occupation. After the royal court returned to [[Lisbon]], the [[prince regent]], [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]], remained in Brazil and in 1822 successfully declared himself emperor of a newly independent Brazil.  \n\nSpain would lose all three of its remaining Caribbean colonies by the end of the 1800s.  [[Dominican Republic|Santo Domingo]] declared independence in 1821 as the [[Republic of Spanish Haiti]]. After [[Unification of Hispaniola|unification]] and then [[Dominican War of Independence|split]] from the former French colony of Haiti, the President of the Dominican Republic signed an agreement that revert the country to a Spanish colony in 1861. This triggered the [[Dominican Restoration War]], which resulted in the Dominican Republic's second independence from Spain in 1865. Cuba fought for independence from Spain in the [[Ten Years' War]] (1868\u20131878) and [[Little War (Cuba)|Little War]] (1879-1880) and finally the [[Cuban War of Independence]] (1895\u201398). American intervention in 1898 became the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and resulted in the United States gaining [[Puerto Rico]] (which is still a U.S. territory), [[Guam]] and the [[Philippine Islands]] in the Pacific Ocean. Under military occupation, Cuba became a U.S. protectorate until its dependence in 1902.\n\nPeaceful independence by voluntary withdrawal of colonial powers then became the norm in the second half of the 20th century. However, there are still many British and Dutch colonies in North America (mostly Caribbean islands), and France has fully integrated most of its former colonies as fully constituent [[Departments of France|departments]] of France.\n\n==Conditions prior to revolution==\n\n===Undermining of metropolitan authority===\n[[File:America 1794.png|thumb|210px|Political map of the Americas in 1794]]\nDuring the 18th century, Spain recovered much of the strength it had lost in the 17th century but the country's resources were under strain because of the incessant warfare in Europe from 1793. This led to an increased local participation in the financing of defense and an increased participation in militias by the locally born. Such development was at odds with the ideals of the centralized [[absolute monarchy]]. The Spanish also made formal concessions to strengthen defense; In [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago|Chilo\u00e9]], Spanish authorities promised freedom from the Encomienda for indigenous locals who settled near the new stronghold of [[Ancud]] (founded in 1768) and contributed to its defense. The increased local organization of the defenses would ultimately undermine metropolitan authority and bolster the independence movement.<ref name=Ossa2010>{{cite journal |last=Ossa Santa Cruz |first=Juan Luis |date=2010 |title=La criollizaci\u00f3n de un ej\u00e9rcito perif\u00e9rico, Chile, 1768 to 1810 |url=http://revistahistoria.uc.cl/estudios/2247/ |journal=[[Historia (history of the Americas journal)|Historia]] |publisher= |volume=42 |issue=II |pages=413\u2013448 |doi= |access-date=27 January 2016 |language=Spanish |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201133624/http://revistahistoria.uc.cl/estudios/2247/ |archive-date=2016-02-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Napoleonic Wars===\n{{main|Napoleonic Wars|Peninsular War}}\nThe Napoleonic Wars were a series of wars fought between [[First French Empire|France]] (led by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]) and alliances involving Britain, [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] at different times, from 1799 to 1815.\n\nIn the case of Spain and its colonies, in May 1808, Napoleon captured Carlos IV and King Fernando VII and installed his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish Throne because he did not want anyone outside of his own bloodline to rule Spain. This  event disrupted the political stability of Spain and broke the link with some of the colonies which were loyal to the Bourbon Dynasty. The local elites, the creoles, took matters into their own hands organizing themselves into ''juntas'' to take \"in absence of the king, Fernando VII, their sovereignty devolved temporarily back to the community\". The juntas swore loyalty to the captive Fernando VII and each ruled different and diverse parts of the colony. Most of Fernando's subjects were loyal to him in 1808, but after he was restored to the Spanish crown in 1814, his policy of restoring absolute power alienated both the juntas and his subjects. He abrogated the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Cadiz Constitution of 1812]] and persecuted anyone who had supported it. The violence used by royalist forces and the prospect of being ruled by Fernando shifted the majority of the colonist population in favor of separation from Spain.<ref>Chambers, Sarah C., and John Charles Chasteen. ''Latin American Independence: An Anthology of Sources''. Indianapolis: Hackett Pub., 2010.</ref> The local elites reacted to absolutism in much the same way that the British colonial elites, Tory and Whig alike, had reacted to London's interference before 1775.\n\n===Spanish military presence in its colonies===\n[[Image:Royalist Hispanic American.png|thumb|200px|left|Graphs showing the make-up of the royalist army at the time of the revolution.]]\n\nThe colonial army of the Spanish Empire in Americas was made up of local American and European supporters of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand]]. The Royalists were made up of a cross-section of society loyal to the crown with Americans composing the majority of the royalist forces on all fronts. There were two types of military units: from the regular Spanish army which were sent out or formed with local Europeans and called Expidicionarios and units called veterans or [[militia]]s created in the Americas. The militias included some veteran units and were called the disciplined militia. Only 11% of the personnel in the militias were European or American whites. After [[Rafael del Riego]]'s revolution in 1820 no more Spanish soldiers were sent to the wars in the Americas. In 1820 there were only 10,000 soldiers in Royal Army in Colombia and Venezuela, and Spaniards formed only 10% of all the royalist armies, and only half of the soldiers of the expeditionary units were European. By the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] in 1824, less than 1% of the soldiers were European.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Other factors===\n{{Main|Enlightenment Spain|Bourbon Reforms}}\n[[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]] spurred the desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout the Americas and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and [[Physiocrats|physiocratic]] [[economics]] were raised by the Enlightenment.\n\nIndependence movements in South America can be traced back to slave revolts in plantations in the northernmost part of the continent and Caribbean. In 1791, a [[Haitian Revolution|massive slave revolt]] sparked a general insurrection against the plantation system and French colonial power.<ref name=\"BBC_Haiti\">{{cite web |date=April 29, 2009|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1202857.stm|title = Timeline: Haiti |publisher = [[BBC News]]| accessdate = 2009-04-30 | last= |quote=}}</ref> These events were followed by a violent uprising led by [[Jos\u00e9 Leonardo Chirino]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Caridad Gonz\u00e1lez]] that sprung up in 1795 Venezuela, allegedly inspired by the revolution in Haiti.\n\nToussaint L'Ouverture was born a slave in Saint-Domingue where he developed labor skills that would give him higher privileges than other slaves. He intellectually and physically advanced resulting in promotion, land of his own, and owning slaves. In 1791, slaves in Haiti formed a revolution to seek independence from their French owners. L'Ouverture joined the rebellion as a top military official with the intention to abolish slavery without complete independence. However, through a series of letters written by Toussaint, it became clear that he grew open to equal human rights for all that live in Haiti. Similar to  how the United States Constitution was ratified, the enlightenment ideas of equality and representation of the people created an impact of change against the status quo that sparked the revolution. The letter details the great concerns he felt due to a conservative shift in France's legislature after the revolution in 1797. The greatest fear was that these conservative values could give ideas to the French Government to bring back slavery. The enlightenment has proven to forever change the way a captive society thinks after L'Ouverture refuses to let the French send him and his people back into slavery. \"[W]hen finally the rule of law took the place of anarchy under which the unfortunate colony had too long suffered, what fatality can have led the greatest enemy of its prosperity and our happiness still to dare to threaten us with the return of slavery?\" Ultimately, slavery was abolished from French colonies in 1794 and Haiti declared Independence from France in 1804.<ref>Toussaint L'Ouverture, \"Letter to the French Directory, 1797\", in Nicola Foote, ''Sources for Latin America in the Modern World''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2018.</ref>\n\n==United States==\n{{main|American Revolution|History of United States continental expansion}}\nThe [[United States|United States of America]] declared independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] on July 4, 1776, thus becoming the first independent, foreign-recognized nation in the Americas and the first European colonial entity to break from its mother country. Britain formally acknowledged American independence in 1783 after its defeat in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The U.S. victory encouraged independent movements in other parts of the Americas.\n\nAlthough initially occupying only the land east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] between Canada and Florida, the United States would later eventually [[Territorial evolution of the United States|acquire various other North American territories]] from the [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[Russian Empire|Russian]]s in succeeding years, effectively decolonizing these areas formerly under European control.\n\n==Haiti and the French Antilles==\n{{Main|Haitian Revolution|Latin American wars of independence}}\nThe [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s had profound effects on the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] colonies in the Americas. [[Haiti]], a French slave colony, was the first to follow the United States to independence, during the [[Haitian Revolution]], which lasted from 1791 to 1804. Thwarted in his attempt to rebuild a French empire in North America, [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] sold [[Louisiana Purchase|Louisiana]] to the United States and from then on focused on the European theater, marking the end of France's ambitions of building a colonial empire in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n== Spanish America ==\n[[File:Americas independence map.PNG|thumb|Places in the Americas by date of independence.{{contradict inline|section=Timeline|article=Decolonization of the Americas|reason=Date of Mexican Independence 1820 or 1821?|date=April 2020}} Note that the United States did not complete its continental territorial expansion until 1867; Canada did not complete sovereignty as an independent country until 1982.]]\n[[File:South America 1799.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Intendant (government official)|Intendecies]] (provinces) of the South American viceroyalties.]]\n{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence}}\n{{further|Libertadores}}\n\nThe Spanish Kingdoms in the Americas won their independence in the first quarter of the 19th century.\n\nDuring the [[Peninsular War]], Napoleon installed his own brother, Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish Throne and captured the King Fernando VII. The crisis of political legitimacy sparked reaction in Spain's overseas empire. Several assemblies were established after 1810 by the ''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|Criollos]]'' (Latin Americans who are of full or near full Spanish descent) to recover sovereignty and self-government based on the [[Siete Partidas|Castilian law]] and to rule American lands in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]].\n\nThis experience of self-government, along with the influence of [[Liberalism]] and the ideas of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution]]s, brought about a struggle for independence, led by the ''[[Libertadores]]''. The territories freed themselves, often with help from foreign mercenaries and privateers. United States, Europe and the [[British Empire]] were neutral, aimed to achieve political influence and trade without the Spanish monopoly.\n\nIn [[South America]], [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] led the final phase of the independence struggle. Although Bol\u00edvar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of the continent politically unified, they rapidly became independent of one another as well, and several further wars were fought, such as the [[Paraguayan War]] and the [[War of the Pacific]].\n\nA related process took place in what is now Mexico, Central America, and parts of North America between 1810 and 1821 with the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. Independence was achieved in 1821 by a coalition uniting under [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] and the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]]. Unity was maintained for a short period under the [[First Mexican Empire]], but within a decade the region fought against the United States over the border lands (losing bordering lands of California and Texas). Most of the heat was during the official [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican-American War]] from 1846 to 1848.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Mexican-American-War|title=Mexican-American War {{!}} Mexico-United States [1846-1848]|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-06|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1898, in the [[Greater Antilles]], the [[United States]] won the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] and occupied [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]], ending Spanish territorial control in the Americas.\n\n===Argentina===\n{{main|Argentine War of Independence}}\n\nAfter the defeat of Spain in the [[Peninsular War]] and the abdication [[King Ferdinand VII]], the Spanish colonial government of the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], present-day [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Uruguay]], became greatly weakened. Without a rightful king in the Spanish throne to render the office of the Viceroy as legitimate, the right of [[Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros|Viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros]] to govern came under fire. The local elites, tired of the Spanish trade restrictions and taxes, seized the opportunity and during the [[May Revolution]] of 1810, removed Cisneros and created the first local government, the [[Primera Junta]].\n\n[[Image:Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn (retrato, c.1828).jpg|thumb|upright|Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]]\n\nFollowing a half a decade of battles and skirmishes with provincial royalist forces within the former Vice-royalty along with military expeditions across the Andes to [[Chile]], [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]] led by [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|General Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] to finally end Spanish rule in America, a formal declaration was signed on July 9, 1816 by an assembly in [[San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n]], declaring full independence with provisions for a national constitution. [[Constitution of Argentina of 1853|The Argentine Constitution]] was signed in 1853, declaring the creation of the [[Argentine Republic]].\n\n===Bolivia===\n{{main|Bolivian War of Independence}}\n\nFollowing upheaval caused by the [[May Revolution]], along with the independence movements in [[Chilean independence|Chile]] and [[Venezuelan Independence War|Venezuela]], local struggle for independence kicked off with two failed revolutions that. Over sixteen years of struggle followed before the first steps towards the establishment of a republic were taken.\n\nFormally, it is considered that the fight for independence culminated in the [[Battle of Ayacucho]], on December 9, 1824.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[Image:Non-Native American Nations Control over South America 1700 and on.gif|thumb|upright|Retreat of European colonialism and change of political borders in South America, 1700\u2013present]]\n\n===Colombia===\n[[Image:Battle-of-Boyaca.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Battle of Boyac\u00e1 sealed Colombia's independence]]\n{{main|Patria Boba|Spanish reconquest of New Granada|Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada}}\n\n===Chile===\n{{main|Chilean War of Independence}}\n\nThe Chilean Independence campaign was led by the Liberator General Jose de San Martin with the support of Chilean exiles such as Bernardo O'Higgins. The local independence movement was composed of Chilean-born criollos, who sought political and economic independence from Spain. The movement for independence was far from gaining unanimous support among Chileans, who became divided between independentists and royalists. What started as an elitist political movement against their colonial master, finally ended as a full-fledged civil war. Traditionally, the process is divided into three stages: [[Patria Vieja]], [[Reconquista (Chile)|Reconquista]], and [[Patria Nueva (Chile)|Patria Nueva]].\n\n===Ecuador===\n{{main|Ecuadorian War of Independence}}\nThe first uprising against Spanish rule took place in 1809, and criollos in Ecuador set up a junta on September 22, 1810 to rule in the name of the Bourbon monarch; but as elsewhere, it allowed assertion of their own power.<ref>David Bushnell, ''Wars of Independence: South America\", in ''The Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 5, p. 447.

The Spanish defeat guaranteed the liberation of Ecuador.\n\n===Guatemala===\nWhen Mexico achieved its independence in 1821 with the Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba, the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] that had ruled Central America became politically independent as well, without the necessity of violent struggle. Guatemala declared its own independence September 15, 1821, likely to prevent the Mexican [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] from \"liberating\" Guatemala and over-riding nascent local autonomy. However, Guatemala chose to be annexed to the [[First Mexican Empire]], led by royalist-turned-insurgent military leader Agust\u00edn de Iturbide, who was proclaimed emperor of Mexico in 1822. When Iturbide abdicated from the monarchy and Mexico took steps to be a republic, Central America claimed its independence.<ref>Ralph Lee Woodward, ''Central America: A Nation Divided''. 2nd edition. New York: Oxford University Press 1985, pp. 85&ndash;90.</ref>\n\n===Mexico===\n{{main|Mexican War of Independence}}\nIndependence in Mexico was a protracted struggle from 1808 until the fall of royal government in 1821 and the establishment of independent Mexico. In the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], as elsewhere in Spanish America in 1808, reacted to the unexpected French invasion of the Iberian peninsula and the ouster of the Bourbon king, replaced by [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. Local American-born Spaniards saw the opportunity to seize control from Viceroy [[Jos\u00e9 de Iturrigaray]] who may well have been sympathetic to creoles aspirations. Iturrigaray was ousted by pro-royalists. A few from among the creole elites sought independence, including [[Juan Aldama]], and [[Ignacio Allende]], and the secular parish priest [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]. Hidalgo made a proclamation in his home parish of Dolores, which was not recorded in writing at the time, but denounced bad government and ''gachupines'' (pejorative for peninsular-born Spaniards), and declared independence. The unorganized hordes following Hidalgo wrought destruction on property and the lives of whites in the region of the Baj\u00edo. Hidalgo was caught, defrocked, and executed in 1811, along with Allende. Their heads remained on display until 1821. His former student [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]] continued the rebellion and was himself caught and killed in 1815. The struggle of Mexican insurgents continued under the leadership of [[Vicente Guerrero]] and [[Guadalupe Victoria]]. From 1815 to 1820 there was a stalemate in New Spain, with royalist forces unable to defeat the insurgents and the insurgents unable to expand beyond their narrow territory in the southern region. Again, events in Spain intervened, with an uprising of military men against Ferdinand VII and the restoration of the liberal [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]], which mandated a constitutional monarchy and curtailed the power of the Roman Catholic Church. The monarch had repudiated the constitution once the Spanish monarchy was restored in 1814.  For conservatives in New Spain, these changed political circumstances threatened the institutions of church and state. Royal military officer [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] seized the opportunity to lead, making an alliance with his former enemy Guerrero. Iturbide proclaimed the [[Plan de Iguala]], which called for independence, equality of peninsular and American-born Spaniards, and a monarchy with a prince from Spain as king. He persuaded the insurgent Guerrero to form an alliance with him and creating the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]]. Crown rule in New Spain collapsed when the incoming Viceroy [[Juan O'Donoj\u00fa]] signed the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] recognizing Mexico's sovereignty. With no European monarch presenting himself for the crown of Mexico, Iturbide himself was proclaimed emperor Agustin I in 1822. He was overthrown in 1823 and Mexico was established as a republic. Decades of political and economic instability ensued which resulted in a decline in population.\n\n===Paraguay===\n[[Paraguay]] [[History of Paraguay#Independence of 1811|gained its independence]] on the night of May 14 and the morning of May 15, 1811, after a plan organized by various pro-independence nationalists including [[Fulgencio Yegros]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]].\n\n===Peru===\n{{main|Peruvian War of Independence}}\n[[File:La Independencia del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]]'s proclamation of the independence of [[Peru]] on 28 July 1821 in [[Lima]]]]\nSpain initially had the support of the Lima oligarchs because of their opposition to the commercial interests of Buenos Aires and Chile. Therefore, the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] became the last redoubt of the Spanish Monarchy in South America. Nevertheless, a Creole rebellion arose in 1812 in [[Hu\u00e1nuco]] and another in [[Cusco]] between 1814 and 1816. Both were suppressed. These rebellions were supported by the armies of Buenos Aires.\n\nPeru finally succumbed after the decisive continental campaigns of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn (1820\u20131823) and Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (1824). While San Martin was in charge of the land campaign, a newly built Chilean Navy led by [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]] transported the fighting troops and launched a sea campaign against the Spanish fleet in the Pacific. San Mart\u00edn, who had displaced the royalists of Chile after the [[Battle of Maip\u00fa]], and who had disembarked in [[Paracas Peninsula|Paracas]] in 1820, proclaimed the independence of Peru in Lima on July 28, 1821. Four years later, the Spanish Monarchy was defeated definitively at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] in late 1824.\n\nAfter independence, the conflicts of interests that faced different sectors of Creole Peruvian society and the particular ambitions of the [[caudillo]]s, made the organization of the country excessively difficult. Only three civilians\u2014Manuel Pardo, Nicol\u00e1s de Pi\u00e9rola and Francisco Garc\u00eda Calder\u00f3n\u2014acceded to the presidency in the first seventy-five years of Peru's independence. The Republic of Bolivia was created from Upper Peru. In 1837 a [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] was also created but was dissolved two years later due to Chilean military intervention.\n\n===Uruguay===\nFollowing the events of the [[May Revolution]], in 1811 [[Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas]], led a successful revolt against the Spanish forces in the Provincia Oriental, now Uruguay, joining the independentist movement that was taking place in the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] at the time. In 1821, the Provincia Oriental was invaded by Portugal, trying to annex it into Brazil under the name of Prov\u00edncia Cisplatina.\n\nThe former Vice-royalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata, [[United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata|The United Provinces of the River Plate]], fought back Brazil in a war that lasted over 2 years, eventually turning into a stalemate. The Brazilian forces withdrew with the United Provinces keeping them at bay but failing to win any decisive victory. With neither side gained the upper hand and the economic burden of the war crippling the United Provinces economy, the [[1828 Treaty of Montevideo|Treaty of Montevideo was signed in 1828]], fostered by Britain, declaring Uruguay as an independent state.<ref>Nilton Freixinho, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20141103172023/http://131.137.250.135/dhh-dhp/his/docs/Coll_21st_Peacekeeping.pdf#page=614 International Relations in South America Nineteenth Century A Case Study: The Independence and Sovereignty of Uruguay]\", in ''Peacekeeping 1815 to Today'' (1995) pp 612\u2013619; {{ISBN|0-662-62062-3}}</ref>\n\n===Venezuela===\n{{main|Venezuelan War of Independence|First Republic of Venezuela|Second Republic of Venezuela}}\n[[Image:Simon Bolivar.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]\n\nAccording to the ''Encyclopedia Americana'' of 1865, General Francisco de Miranda, already a hero to the French, Prussians, English and Americans had garnered a series of successes against the Spanish between 1808 and 1812. He had effectively negated their access to all the ports on the Caribbean, thus preventing them from receiving reinforcements and supplies and was essentially conducting mopping-up operations throughout the country. At that point he convinced Simon Bol\u00edvar to join the struggle and put him in charge of the fort at Puerto Cabello. This was all at once a supply and arms depot, a strategic port and the central holding facility for Spanish prisoners. Through what amounts to a gross dereliction of duty, Simon Bol\u00edvar neglected to enforce the customary security dispositions before departing to a social event. During the night there was an uprising of the Spanish prisoners and they managed to subdue the Independentist garrison and gain control of the supplies, the arms and ammunition, and the port. The Loyalist forces progressively regained control of the country and eventually Monteverde's successes forced the newly formed congress of the republic to ask of Miranda that he sign a capitulation at La Victoria in Aragua, on July 12, 1812, thus ending the first phase of the revolutionary war.\n\nAfter the capitulation of 1812, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] turned over Francisco de Miranda to the Spanish authorities, secured a safe passage for himself and his closest officers and fled to [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]]. He later returned with a new army, while the war had entered a tremendously violent phase. After much of the local aristocracy had abandoned the cause of independence, blacks and mulattoes carried on the struggle. Elites reacted with open distrust and opposition to the efforts of these common people. Bol\u00edvar's forces [[Admirable Campaign|invaded Venezuela from New Granada]] in 1813, waging a campaign with a ferocity captured perfectly by their motto of \"[[Decree of War to the Death|war to the death]]\". Bol\u00edvar's forces defeated Domingo Monteverde's Spanish army in a series of battles, taking [[Caracas]] on August 6, 1813 and besieging Monteverde at [[Puerto Cabello]] in September 1813.\n\n[[File:BatallaCarabobo01.JPG|thumb|right|Battle of Carabobo]]\n\nWith loyalists displaying the same passion and violence, the rebels achieved only short-lived victories. The army led by the loyalist [[Jos\u00e9 Tom\u00e1s Boves]] demonstrated the key military role that the ''[[Llanero]]s'' came to play in the region's struggle. Turning the tide against independence, these highly mobile, ferocious fighters made up a formidable military force that pushed Bol\u00edvar out of his home country once more. In 1814, heavily reinforced Spanish forces in Venezuela lost a series of battles to Bol\u00edvar's forces but then decisively defeated Bolivar at La Puerta on June 15, took Caracas on July 16, and again defeated his army at [[Aragua de Matur\u00edn|Aragua]] on August 18, at a cost of 2,000 Spanish casualties out of 10,000 soldiers as well as most of the 3,000 in the rebel army. Bol\u00edvar and other leaders then returned to New Granada. Later that year the largest expeditionary force ever sent by Spain to America arrived under the command of [[Pablo Morillo]]. This force effectively replaced the improvised llanero units, who were [[Military discharge|disbanded]] by Morillo.\n\nBol\u00edvar and other republican leaders returned to Venezuela in December 1816, leading a largely unsuccessful insurrection against Spain from 1816 to 1818 from bases in the [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]] and [[Ciudad Bol\u00edvar]] in the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]] area.\n\nIn 1819 Bol\u00edvar successfully invaded New Granada, and returned to Venezuela in April 1821, leading a large army of 7,000. At [[Battle of Carabobo|Carabobo]] on June 24, his forces decisively defeated Spanish and colonial forces, winning Venezuelan independence, although hostilities continued.\n\n==Brazil==\n{{main|Independence of Brazil}}\n[[File:Independencia brasil 001.jpg|thumb|Prince [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] after giving the news of the Brazilian independence on 7 September 1822]]\nUnlike the Spanish, the Portuguese did not divide their colonial territory in the Americas. The captaincies they created were subdued to a centralized administration in Salvador which reported directly to the Crown in Lisbon. Therefore, it is not common to refer to \"Portuguese America\" (like Spanish America, Dutch America, etc.), but rather to Brazil, as a unified colony since its very beginnings.\n\nAs a result, Brazil did not split into several states by the time of independence (1822), as happened to its Spanish-speaking neighbors. The adoption of monarchy instead of federal republic in the first six decades of Brazilian political sovereignty also contributed to the nation's unity.\n\nAfter several failed revolts, in the Portuguese colony [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese [[monarch|king]] [[Dom Jo\u00e3o VI]], proclaimed the country's independence in 1822 and became Brazil's first [[Emperor]]. This began when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] forced the Portuguese court out of their capital city of Lisbon and into exile in Brazil. Over the next eight years the capital of the Portuguese empire would be located in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In 1815, after Lisbon was reclaimed from the French by the Portuguese, King Dom Jo\u00e3o VI declared that Rio and Lisbon would become equal centers of the empire. King Jo\u00e3o VI was forced back to Lisbon in 1821 by the Portuguese Cortes, but left his son Dom Pedro behind to run Rio. A year later, Dom Pedro declared independence for Brazil and officially became emperor Pedro I. Brazil's independence was met with little resistance from Portugal, and they were officially recognized by their former colonial overlords in 1825. \n<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meade |first1=Teresa |title=A History of Modern Latin America |date=2016 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd |location=West Sussex, UK |isbn=9781118772485 |pages=70 |edition=Second}}</ref>\n\n==Canada==\n{{main|Canadian Confederation}}\n[[Canada]]'s transition from colonial rule to independence occurred gradually over many decades and was achieved mostly through political means, as opposed to the violent revolutions that marked the end of colonialism in other North and South American countries. Attempts at revolting against the British, such as the [[Rebellion of 1837]], were brief and quickly put down. Canada was declared a dominion within the British Empire in 1867. Originally, the Canadian Confederation included just a few of what are now Canada's eastern provinces; other British colonies in modern-day Canada, such as [[British Columbia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Newfoundland]], would join later. Additionally, Britain's and Norway's claims to Arctic lands were ceded to Canada in the late 19th and early 20th century. By 1931, the United Kingdom had relinquished its control over Canada's foreign policy. What few political links that remained between Canada and the UK were formally severed in 1982 with the [[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]].\n\n==20th century==\nOther countries did not gain independence until the 20th century:\n\nFrom the United Kingdom:\n* [[Jamaica]]: from the [[United Kingdom]], in 1962\n* [[Trinidad and Tobago]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1962\n* [[Guyana]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1966.\n* [[Barbados]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1966\n* [[Bahamas]]: Granted internal self-government in 1964 and, then achieved full independence from the United Kingdom in 1973.\n* [[Grenada]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1974\n* [[Dominica]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1978\n* [[Saint Lucia]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1979\n* [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1979\n* [[Antigua and Barbuda]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1981\n* [[Belize]] (formerly British Honduras): from the United Kingdom, in 1981\n* [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]]: from the United Kingdom, in 1983\n\nFrom the Netherlands:\n* [[Suriname]]: from [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], in 1975\n\n==Current non-sovereign territories==\nSome parts of the Americas are still administered by European countries or the United States:\n* [[Anguilla]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[Aruba]] (Netherlands)\n* [[Bermuda]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[Bonaire]] (Netherlands)\n* [[British Virgin Islands]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[Cayman Islands]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[Curacao]] (Netherlands)\n* [[Falkland Islands]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[French Guiana]] (France)\n* [[Greenland]] (Kingdom of Denmark)\n* [[Guadeloupe]] (France)\n* [[Martinique]] (France)\n* [[Montserrat]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[Puerto Rico]] (United States)\n* [[Saba]] (Netherlands)\n* [[Saint Barthelemy]] (France)\n* [[Saint Martin (France)|Saint Martin]] (France)\n* [[Saint-Pierre and Miquelon]] (France)\n* [[Sint Eustatius]] (Netherlands)\n* [[Sint Marteen]] (Netherlands)\n* [[South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[Turks and Caicos Islands]] (United Kingdom)\n* [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] (United States)\n\nSome of the remaining non-sovereign territories of the Americas have retained this status by choice, and enjoy a significant degree of self-government. (Some have nevertheless been placed on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories#Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea|U.N. list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], an ongoing subject of controversy.) Aruba, for example, seceded from the Netherlands Antilles on January 1, 1986, and became a separate, self-governing member of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Movement toward full independence by 1996 was halted at Aruba's request in 1990. [[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]] are not considered [[dependent territories]] of [[France]], but have been \"incorporated\" into France itself, as overseas ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partements]]'' (''[[d\u00e9partements d'outre-mer]], or DOM''). Other regions however have had or currently have movements to change their political status, for example different movements to change the [[political status of Puerto Rico]] and intermittent calls for independence in other non-sovereign territories such as [[Martinican Independence Movement|Martinique]] and others, with differing amounts of support.\n\n==Timeline==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

This measure ostensibly was taken in order to safeguard the newfound liberties of these new countries, but it was also taken as a precautionary measure against the intrusion of European states.{{Citation needed| reason = This is the authors opinion, which can be contested with the premise that the doctrine was aimed to conquer Mexico. |date=October 2014}} Since the United States was a newly founded nation, it lacked the capacity to prevent other European powers from interfering, for that the United States looked for Britain's help and support to execute the Monroe Doctrine into action.\n\nGreat Britain's trade with Latin America greatly expanded during the revolutionary period, which until then was restricted due to Spanish [[mercantilism|mercantilist]] trade policies. British pressure was sufficient to prevent Spain from attempting any serious reassertion of its control over its lost colonies.\n\n===Attempts at hemispheric unity===\n{{main|Latin American integration}}\n\nThe notion of closer Spanish American cooperation and unity was first put forward by the Liberator [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] who, at the 1826 [[Congress of Panama]], proposed the creation a league of American republics, with a common military, a mutual defense pact, and a supranational parliamentary assembly. This meeting was attended by representatives of [[Great Colombia|Gran Colombia]] (comprising the modern-day nations of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela), [[Peru]], the [[United Provinces of Central America]] ([[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], and [[Costa Rica]]), and [[Mexico]].  Nevertheless, the great distances and geographical barriers, not to mention the different national and regional interests, made union impossible.\n\nSixty-three years later the Commercial Bureau of the American Republics was established. It was renamed the International Commercial Bureau at the Second International Conference of 1901\u20131902. These two bodies, in existence as of 14 April 1890, represent the point of inception of today's [[Organization of American States]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Colonialism]]\n* [[Decolonization]]\n* [[Wars of national liberation]]\n* [[Predecessors of sovereign states in South America]]\n* [[Creole nationalism]]\n* [[Spanish Empire]]\n* [[Libertadores]]\n* [[Spanish reconquest of Mexico]]\n* [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|Spanish American Royalists]]\n* [[Wars of national liberation]]\n* [[History of Central America]]\n* [[History of South America]]\n* [[History of Cuba]]\n* [[History of the Dominican Republic]]\n* [[History of Puerto Rico]]\n* [[Age of Revolution]]\n* [[Territorial evolution of the Caribbean]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Andrien, Kenneth J. and Lyman, L.

Most common types of DJs include [[Radio personality|radio DJs]], club DJs, who perform at a [[nightclub]] or [[music festival]] and [[turntablism|turntablists]] who use record players, usually [[turntable]]s, to manipulate sounds on [[phonograph record]]s. Originally, the \"disc\" in \"disc jockey\" referred to [[vinyl records]], but nowadays DJ is used as an all-encompassing term to also describe persons who [[DJ mix|mix]] music from other recording media such as [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[Compact disc|CDs]] or [[digital audio file]]s on a [[CDJ]] or a [[laptop]]. The title \"DJ\" is often used by DJs in front of their real names, adopted [[pseudonym]]s, or [[stage name]]s.\n\nDJs use audio equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]] to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique [[DJ mix|mixes]] of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms and tempos do not clash when played together and to enable a smooth transition from one song to another. DJs often use specialized [[DJ mixer]]s, small [[Audio console|audio mixers]] with [[crossfader]] and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions to blend or transition from one song to another. Mixers are also used to pre-listen to sources of recorded music in [[headphones]] and adjust upcoming tracks to mix with currently playing music. DJ software can be used with a [[DJ controller]] device to mix audio files on a computer instead of a console mixer. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.\n\n==Role==\n[[File:Avicii @ Inox Park Paris Chatou 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Avicii]] at work in [[Paris]] in 2011]]\nOriginally, the \"disc\" in \"disc jockey\" referred to [[gramophone record]]s, but now \"DJ\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including [[vinyl records]], [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[CD]]s, or [[digital audio file]]s stored on [[USB flash drive|USB stick]] or [[laptop]]. DJs typically perform for a live audience in a [[nightclub]] or dance club or a TV, radio broadcast audience, or an [[online radio]] audience. DJs also create mixes, remixes and tracks that are recorded for later sale and distribution. In [[hip hop music]], DJs may create beats, using percussion [[Break (music)|break]]s, [[bassline]]s and other musical content [[sampling (music)|sampled]] from pre-existing records. In hip hop, rappers and MCs use these beats to [[rapping|rap]] over.\n\n{{Duplication|section=yes|date=April 2020}}\nDJs use equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]]. This allows the DJ to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms do not clash when they are played together, either so two records can be played at the same time, or to enable the DJ to make a smooth transition from one song to another. An important tool for DJs is the specialized [[DJ mixer]], a small [[audio console|audio mixer]] with a [[crossfader]]  and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions. The crossfader enables the DJ to blend or transition from one song to another. The cue knobs or switches allow the DJ to \"listen\" to a source of recorded music in [[headphones]] before playing it for the live club or broadcast audience. Previewing the music in headphones helps the DJ pick the next track they want to play, [[cue (audio)|cue up]] the track to the desired starting location, and align the two tracks' beats in traditional situations where auto sync technology is not being used. This process ensures that the selected song will mix well with the currently playing music. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects; and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.\n\nThe title \"DJ\" is also often used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted [[pseudonym]]s or [[stage name]]s as a title to denote their profession (e.g., [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[DJ Qbert]], [[DJ Shadow]] and [[DJ Yoda]]). Some DJs focus on creating a good mix of songs for the club dancers or radio audience. Other DJs use [[turntablism]] techniques such as [[scratching]], in which the DJ or [[turntablism|turntablist]] manipulates the [[phonograph|record player turntable]] to create new rhythms and sounds. DJs need to have a mixture of artistic and technical skills for their profession, because they have to understand both the creative aspects of making new musical beats and tracks, and the technical aspects of using [[mixing console]]s, professional audio equipment, [[digital audio workstation]]s and other computerized music gear. In many types of DJing, including club DJing and radio/TV DJing, a DJ also has to have [[charisma]] and develop a good rapport with the audience. Professional DJs often specialize in a specific genre of music, such as [[techno]], [[house music|house]] or [[hip hop music|hip hop]] music. DJs typically have an extensive knowledge about the music they specialize in. Many DJs are avid music collectors of vintage, rare or obscure tracks and records.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Radio DJs===\n{{Main|Radio personality}}\n\nRadio DJs or [[radio personality|radio personalities]] introduce and play music broadcast on [[AM broadcasting|AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[Digital radio|digital]] or [[Internet radio]] stations.\n\n===Club DJs===\n[[File:Pete Rock @ The Brookyln Bowl in 2016.jpg|thumbnail|right|\nDJ [[Pete Rock]] performing at Razel and Friends - Brooklyn Bowl, 2016]]\nClub DJs, commonly referred as DJs in general, play music at musical events, such as parties at [[Nightclub|music venues]] or [[bar]]s, [[music festival]]s, corporate and private events. Typically, club DJs mix music recordings from two or more sources using different mixing techniques in order to produce non-stopping flow of music. One key technique used for seamlessly transitioning from one song to another is [[beatmatching]]. A DJ who mostly plays and mixes one specific music genre is often given the title of that genre; for example, a DJ who plays hip hop music is called a hip hop DJ, a DJ who plays house music is a house DJ, a DJ who plays techno is called a techno DJ, and so on. The quality of a DJ performance (often called a DJ mix or DJ set) consists of two main features: technical skills, or how well can DJ operate the equipment and produce smooth transitions between two or more recordings and a playlist; and the ability of a DJ to select most suitable recordings, also known as \"reading the crowd\".<ref>[https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2011/12/how-to-read-a-crowd-and-what-happens-if-you-dont/ How To Read A Crowd (And What Happens If You Don\u2019t)], ''Digital DJ Tips'', 3 November 2017</ref>\n\n===Turntablists===\n{{Main|Turntablism}}\n\nTurntablists, also called battle DJs, use [[Phonograph|turntables]] and [[DJ mixer]] to manipulate recorded sounds in order to produce new music.  In essence, they use DJ equipment as a musical instrument. The most known turntablist technique is [[scratching]].

Traditionally, DJs used two [[turntable]]s plugged into a [[DJ mixer]] to mix music on vinyl records. As [[compact disc]]s became popular media for publishing music, specialized high quality CD players known as [[CDJ]]s were developed for DJs. CDJs can take the place of turntables or be used together with turntables. Many CDJs can now play digital music files from [[USB flash drive]]s or [[Secure Digital|SD cards]] in addition to CDs. With the spread of portable [[laptop]], [[tablet computer|tablet]], and [[smartphone]] computers, DJs began using software together with specialized [[sound card]]s and [[DJ controller]] hardware. DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer or be used instead of a hardware mixer.\n\n===Turntables===\n{{Main|Turntablism}}\n[[Turntable]]s allow DJs to play vinyl records. By adjusting the playback speed of the turntable, either by adjusting the speed knob, or by manipulating the platter (e.g., by slowing down the platter by putting a finger gently along the side), DJs can match the [[tempo]]s of different records so their rhythms can be played together at the same time without clashing or make a smooth, seamless transition from one song to another. This technique is known as [[beatmatching]]. DJs typically replace the rubber mat on turntables that keeps the record moving in sync with the turntable with a [[slipmat]] that facilitates manipulating the playback of the record by hand. With the slipmat, the DJ can stop or slow down the record while the turntable is still spinning. [[Direct-drive turntable]]s are the type preferred by DJs, with the [[Technics SL-1200]] being the most popular model of turntables for DJs. Belt-drive turntables are less expensive, but they are not suitable for turntablism and DJing, because the belt-drive motor does not like being slowed down, as it can stretch out the belt. Some DJs, most commonly those who play [[hip hop]] music, go beyond merely mixing records and use turntables as musical instruments for [[scratching]], [[beat juggling]], and other [[turntablism]] techniques.\n\n===CDJs===\n{{Main|CDJ}}\nCDJs are high quality digital media players made for DJing. They often have large jog wheels and [[pitch control]]s to allow DJs to manipulate the playback of digital files for [[beatmatching]] similar to how DJs manipulate vinyl records on turntables. CDJs often have features such as loops and waveform displays similar to DJ software. Originally designed to play music from [[compact disc]]s, they now can play digital music files stored on [[USB flash drive]]s and [[Secure Digital|SD card]]s. Some CDJs can also connect to a computer running DJ software to act as a [[DJ controller]].\n\n===DJ mixers===\n{{Main|DJ mixer}}\n[[File:DJ Mixer.JPG|thumb|upright|right|A [[Numark (DJ equipment)|Numark]] DM2002X Pro Master DJ mixer. This three channel mixer can have up to three input sound sources. The [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] control knobs and [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] control knobs allow the volume and tone of each sound source to be adjusted. The vertical faders allow for further adjustment of the volume of each sound source. The horizontally-mounted [[crossfader (audio engineering)|crossfader]] enables the DJ to smoothly transition from a [[song]] on one sound source to a song from a different sound source.]]\nDJ mixers are small audio [[mixing console]]s specialized for DJing. Most DJ mixers have far fewer channels than a mixer used by a [[record producer]] or [[audio engineer]]; whereas standard live sound mixers in small venues have 12 to 24 channels, and standard [[recording studio]] mixers have even more (as many as 72 on large boards), basic DJ mixers may have only two channels. While DJ mixers have many of the same features found on larger mixers (faders, equalization knobs, gain knobs, [[effects unit]]s, etc.), DJ mixers have a feature that is usually only found on DJ mixers: the [[crossfader]]. The crossfader is a type of fader that is mounted horizontally. DJs used the crossfader to mix two or more sound sources. The midpoint of the crossfader's travel is a 50/50 mix of the two channels (on a two channel mixer). The far left side of the crossfader provides only the channel A sound source. The far right side provides only the channel B sound source (e.g., record player number 2). Positions in between the two extremes provide different mixes of the two channels. Some DJs use a computer with DJ software and a [[DJ controller]] instead of an analog DJ mixer to mix music, although DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer.\n\n===Headphones===\n{{Main|Headphones}}\nDJs generally use higher quality headphones than those designed for music consumers. DJ headphones have other properties useful for DJs, such as designs that acoustically isolate the sounds of the headphones from the outside environment (hard shell headphones), flexible headbands and pivot joints to allow DJs to listen to one side of the headphones, while turning the other headphone away (so he/she can monitor the mix in the club), and replaceable cables. Replaceable cables enables DJs to buy new cables if a cable becomes frayed, worn, or damaged, or if a cable is accidentally cut.\n\nClosed-back headphones are highly recommended for DJs to block outside noise as the environment of DJ usually tend to be very noisy. Standard headphones have 3.5mm jack but DJ equipment usually requires \u00bc inch jack. Most of specialized DJ Headphones have an adapter to switch between 3.5mm jack and \u00bc inch jack. Detachable coiled cables are perfect for DJ Headphones.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.getaheadphone.com/the-5-best-dj-headphones-of-2016/|title = Best DJ Headphones| accessdate =27 October 2016|year=2016|author=GetAHeadphone}}</ref>\n\n===Software===\n{{See also|List of music software#DJ software}}\n[[File:Mixxx-1.11.0-Deere.png|thumb|left|A [[screenshot]] of [[Mixxx]] DJ software running on [[Mac OS X]]]]\n\nDJs have changed their equipment as new technologies are introduced. The earliest DJs in pop music, in 1970s discos, used [[phonograph|record turntable]]s, vinyl records and [[audio console]]s. In the 1970s, DJs would have to lug heavy direct drive turntables and crates of records to clubs and shows. In the 1980s, many DJs transitioned to [[compact cassette]]s. In the 1990s and 2000s, many DJs switched to using [[digital audio]] such as [[CD]]s and [[MP3]] files. As technological advances made it practical to store large collections of digital music files on a [[laptop]] computer, DJ software was developed so DJs could use a laptop as a source of music instead of transporting CDs or vinyl records to gigs. Unlike most [[media player (software)|music player software]] designed for [[consumer electronics|regular consumers]], DJ software can play at least two audio files simultaneously, display the [[waveform]]s of the files on screen and enable the DJ to listen to either source.\n\nThe waveforms allow the DJ see what is coming next in the music and how the playback of different files is aligned. The software analyzes music files to identify their tempo and where the beats are. The analyzed information can be used by the DJ to help manually [[beatmatch]] like with vinyl records or the software can automatically synchronize the beats. [[Digital signal processing]] algorithms in software allow DJs to adjust the [[tempo]] of recordings independently of their [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (and musical [[key (music)|key]], a feature known as \"keylock\". Some software analyzes the loudness of the music for automatic normalization with [[ReplayGain]] and detects the musical key. Additionally, DJ software can store cue points, set loops, and apply [[effects unit|effects]].\n\nAs [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became widespread, DJ software was written to run on these devices in addition to laptops.\nDJ software requires specialized hardware in addition to a computer to fully take advantage of its features. The consumer grade, regular [[sound card]] integrated into most computer motherboards can only output two channels (one stereo pair). However, DJs need to be able to output at least four channels (two stereo pairs, thus Left and Right for input 1 and Left and Right for input 2), either unmixed signals to send to a DJ mixer or a main output plus a headphone output. Additionally, DJ sound cards output higher quality signals than the sound cards built into consumer-grade computer motherboards.\n\n===Timecode===\nSpecial vinyl records (or CDs/digital files played with [[CDJ]]s) can be used with DJ software to play digital music files with DJ software as if they were pressed onto vinyl, allowing [[turntablism]] techniques to be used with digital files. These vinyl records do not have music recordings pressed on to them. Instead, they are pressed with a special signal, referred to as \"timecode\", to control DJ software. The DJ software interprets changes in the playback speed, direction, and position of the timecode signal and manipulates the digital files it is playing in the same way that the turntable manipulates the timecode record.\n\nThis requires a specialized DJ [[sound card]] with at least 4 channels (2 stereo pairs) of inputs and outputs. With this setup, the DJ software typically outputs unmixed signals from the music files to an external hardware [[DJ mixer]]. Some DJ mixers have integrated [[USB]] sound cards that allow DJ software to connect directly to the mixer without requiring a separate sound card.\n\n===DJ controllers===\n{{Main|DJ controller}}\nDJ software can be used to mix audio files on the computer instead of a separate hardware mixer. When mixing on a computer, DJs often use a [[DJ controller]] device that mimics the layout of two turntables plus a DJ mixer to control the software rather than the [[computer keyboard]] & [[touchpad]] on a laptop, or the [[touchscreen]] on a [[tablet computer]] or [[smartphone]]. Many DJ controllers have an integrated [[sound card]] with 4 output channels (2 stereo pairs) that allows the DJ to use headphones to preview music before playing it on the main output.<ref>{{Cite book|title=DJing for dummies|last=Steventon, John, 1975-|isbn=9781118937280|edition= 3rd|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=888464041|date = 3 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Other equipment===\n* A [[microphone]], so that the DJ can introduce songs and speak to the audience over the sound system.\n* Electronic [[effects unit]]s such as [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[reverb]], [[octave]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]], [[chorus effect|chorus]], etc.\n* Multi-stylus head shells, which allow a DJ to play different grooves of the same record at the same time.\n* [[Sampler (musical instrument)|Sampler]]s, [[Music sequencer|sequencers]], electronic musical keyboards ([[synthesizer]]s), or [[drum machine]]s.\n* [[PA system]] or [[sound reinforcement system]] ([[power amplifier]]s and [[speaker enclosure]]s), typically including [[subwoofer]] cabinets for deep bass (or, if a DJ is broadcasting and/or recording a set, broadcasting equipment or recording gear)\n*[[Foldback (sound engineering)|Monitor speaker]]s, for listening to the \"house mix\" that is playing over the main speakers\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:DJ Grand Wizzard Theodore (right), inventor of vinyl record scratching technique.jpg|thumb|In the early 1970s in the South Bronx, a young teen DJ called [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]] invented the \"DJ scratch\" technique. Other DJs, like [[Grandmaster Flash]], took the technique to higher levels to the familiar sound and technique we hear today.]]\nSeveral techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the [[cueing (playback)|cueing]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.\n\n{{Side box|above='''DJ Techniques'''\n|text=\n[[Back spinning]]\n*[[Beat juggling]]\n*[[Beatmatching]]\n*[[Chopping (sampling technique)|Chopping]] and [[Chopped and screwed|screwing]]\n*[[Harmonic mixing]]\n*[[Loop (music)|Looping]]\n*[[Needle drop (DJing)|Needle dropping]]\n*[[Phrasing (DJ)|Phrasing]]\n*[[Scratching]]\n*[[Slip-cueing]]}}\nClub DJ turntable techniques include [[beatmatching]], [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[slip-cueing]] to preserve energy on a dance floor. [[Turntablism]] embodies the art of cutting, [[beat juggling]], [[scratching]], [[Needle drop (DJing)|needle drop]]s, [[phase shifting]], [[back spinning]] and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of [[Sampling (music)|samples]] in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a [[musical instrument]] rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use [[harmonic mixing]] to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmonic mixing: The Basics|url=http://www.harmonic-mixing.com/HowTo.aspx|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Mixes Remixes|url=http://www.surroundsounddj.com/dj-mixes-remixes/|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nRecent advances in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[beatmatching]], which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic [[synchronization]] of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled \"sync\". Most [[DJ mixer]]s now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in [[beats per minute]] (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources.\n\nIn the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815205546/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |archivedate=15 August 2014  }}</ref>\n\n===Miming===\nIn DJ culture, [[Miming in instrumental performance|miming]] refers to the practice of DJ's pantomiming the actions of live-mixing a set on stage while a pre-recorded mix plays over the sound system.<ref name=\"Fonarow2006\">Wendy Fonarow.

Early [[belt-drive turntable]]s were unsuitable for turntablism and mixing, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LApZ8KV7bZAC&pg=PA43 ''The World of DJs and the Turntable Culture'', page 43], [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], 2003</ref> The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] (now [[Panasonic]]),<ref>''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 21 May 1977, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XCMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT140 page 140]</ref> based in [[Osaka]], Japan.<ref>Brian Santo, \"Consumer Electrics Hall of Fame: The Maysushita/Technics SL-1200,\" ''IEEE Spectrum'' (20 Dec. 2018): https://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/gadgets/the-consumer-electronics-hall-of-fame-the-matsushitatechnics-sl1200; and Shuichi Obata et al., \"...Recent Technology\", ''Journal of the Audio Engineering Society'' 32/6 (Apr. 1984), 131.</ref> It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests.<ref name=\"oxford\">Trevor Pinch, Karin Bijsterveld, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KuRfLG0IedYC&pg=PA515 ''The Oxford Handbook of Sound Studies'', page 515], [[Oxford University Press]]</ref> In 1969, Matsushita released it as the [[Technics (brand)|SP-10]],<ref name=\"oxford\"/> the first direct-drive turntable on the market,<ref name=\"reverb\">{{cite web|title=History of the Record Player Part II: The Rise and Fall|url=https://reverb.com/news/history-of-the-record-player-part-ii-the-rise-and-fall|website=[[Reverb.com]]|accessdate=5 June 2016}}</ref> and the first in their influential [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] series of turntables.<ref name=\"oxford\"/>\n\nIn 1972, Technics started making their [[Technics SL-1200|SL-1200 turntable]], which became the most popular turntable for DJs due to its high torque [[direct-drive turntable|direct drive]] design.<ref name=\"wired\">[https://www.wired.com/2002/05/blackbox/ Six Machines That Changed The Music World], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', May 2002</ref> The SL-1200 had a rapid start and its durable direct drive enabled DJs to manipulate the platter, as with scratching techniques. [[Hip hop]] DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with [[turntablism]] techniques such as [[scratching]] and [[beat juggling]] rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by [[DJ Kool Herc]], [[Grand Wizard Theodore]], and [[Afrika Bambaataa]], as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter.<ref name=\"wired\"/> Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.\n\nIn 1980, Japanese company [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] released the [[Roland TR-808|TR-808]], an analog [[Drum machine|rhythm/drum machine]], which has unique artificial sounds, such as its booming [[Bass drum|bass]] and sharp [[Snare drum|snare]], and a [[metronome]]-like [[rhythm]]. [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'s use of the instrument in 1980 influenced hip hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa, after which the TR-808 would be widely adopted by hip hop DJs, with 808 sounds remaining central to hip hop music ever since.<ref name=\"kulkarni\">Neil Kulkarni (2015), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ysyiCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA44 ''The Periodic Table of HIP HOP'', page 44], [[Random House]]</ref><ref name=\"808film\">[[808 (film)|''808'' (documentary film)]]</ref> The [[Roland TB-303]], a [[bass synthesizer]] released in 1981, had a similar impact on [[electronic dance music]] genres such as [[techno]] and [[house music]],<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite web|last=Vine|first=Richard|title=Tadao Kikumoto invents the Roland TB-303|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/tadao-kikumoto-roland|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=15 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"kulkarni\"/> along with Roland's TR-808<ref name=\"808film\"/> and [[TR-909]] drum machines.<ref name=\"complex\">[http://complex.com/music/2014/09/roland-tr-909-tracks/ Complex.com]</ref><ref name=\"mixmag\">[http://mixmag.net/feature/909-tracks-using-the-tr-909 Mixmag]</ref>\n\nIn 1982, the [[Compact Disc]] (CD) format was released, popularizing [[digital audio]]. In 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player was released, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10. Final Scratch debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded vinyl records or CDs. While it would take some time for this novel concept to catch on with the \"die hard Vinyl DJs\", this would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the \"CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit\", to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.\n\nIn 2001, [[Pioneer DJ]] began producing the [[CDJ#CDJ-1000|CDJ-1000]] [[CD player]], making the use of digital music recordings with traditional DJ techniques practical for the first time. As the 2000s progressed, [[laptop]] computers became more powerful and affordable. [[#Software|DJ software]], specialized DJ [[sound card]]s, and [[DJ controller]]s were developed for DJs to use laptops as a source of music rather than turntables or CDJs. In the 2010s, like laptops before them, [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became more powerful & affordable. DJ software was written to run on these more portable devices instead of laptops, although laptops remain the more common type of computer for DJing.\n\n== Female DJs ==\nIn Western [[popular music]], [[Women in music|women musicians]] have achieved great success in singing and songwriting roles, however, there are relatively few women DJs or turntablists. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs. A 2013 ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' article stated that there are \"...few women in [[Music producer|record production]] and [[sound engineering]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}</ref> Ncube states that \"[n]inety-five percent of music producers are male, and although there are female producers achieving great things in music, they are less well-known than their male counterparts.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  The vast majority of students in music technology programs are male. In [[hip hop music]], the low percentage of women DJs and turntablists may stem from the overall male domination of the entire hip hop music industry. Most of the top rappers, MCs, DJs, record producers and music executives are men. There are a small number of high-profile women, but they are rare. \n[[File:Dj Virgin .jpg|thumb|left|DJ Virgin is a [[London]]-based DJ,<ref name=\"DJM\">{{cite web |title=DJ VIRGIN LONDON |url=https://djanemag.com/djanes/dj-virgin-london |website=Djanemag.com |publisher=DJane Magazine |accessdate=10 January 2020}}</ref> pictured here mixing with a Pioneer DJ Controller which can replicate the sound of vinyl record players.]]\nIn 2007 Mark Katz's article \"Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle,\" stated that \"very few women [do turntablism] battle[s]; the matter has been a topic of conversation among hip-hop DJs for years.\"<ref name=\"gender\">{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Mark|date=12 December 2007|title=Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle|url=https://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/4/580.full#fn-9|journal=The Musical Quarterly|volume=89|issue=4|pages=580\u2013599|doi=10.1093/musqtl/gdm007|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> In 2010 Rebekah Farrugia states \"the male-centricity of EDM culture\" contributes to \"a marginalisation of women in these [EDM] spaces.\" <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Dance Floor: Female DJs, Technology and Electronic Dance Music Culture|last=Farrugia|first=Rebekah|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1841505664|location=|pages=}}</ref> While turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests use or lack of use of the turntable broadly by women across genres and disciplines is impacted upon by what he defines as \"male [[technophilia]].\"<ref name=\"gender\" /> Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on engineering with this idea of socialization as a central factor in the lack of engagement with technology.

Most common types of DJs include [[Radio personality|radio DJs]], club DJs, who perform at a [[nightclub]] or [[music festival]] and [[turntablism|turntablists]] who use record players, usually [[turntable]]s, to manipulate sounds on [[phonograph record]]s. Originally, the \"disc\" in \"disc jockey\" referred to [[vinyl records]], but nowadays DJ is used as an all-encompassing term to also describe persons who [[DJ mix|mix]] music from other recording media such as [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[Compact disc|CDs]] or [[digital audio file]]s on a [[CDJ]] or a [[laptop]]. The title \"DJ\" is often used by DJs in front of their real names, adopted [[pseudonym]]s, or [[stage name]]s.\n\nDJs use audio equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]] to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique [[DJ mix|mixes]] of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms and tempos do not clash when played together and to enable a smooth transition from one song to another. DJs often use specialized [[DJ mixer]]s, small [[Audio console|audio mixers]] with [[crossfader]] and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions to blend or transition from one song to another. Mixers are also used to pre-listen to sources of recorded music in [[headphones]] and adjust upcoming tracks to mix with currently playing music. DJ software can be used with a [[DJ controller]] device to mix audio files on a computer instead of a console mixer. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.\n\n==Role==\n[[File:Avicii @ Inox Park Paris Chatou 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Avicii]] at work in [[Paris]] in 2011]]\nOriginally, the \"disc\" in \"disc jockey\" referred to [[gramophone record]]s, but now \"DJ\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including [[vinyl records]], [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[CD]]s, or [[digital audio file]]s stored on [[USB flash drive|USB stick]] or [[laptop]]. DJs typically perform for a live audience in a [[nightclub]] or dance club or a TV, radio broadcast audience, or an [[online radio]] audience. DJs also create mixes, remixes and tracks that are recorded for later sale and distribution. In [[hip hop music]], DJs may create beats, using percussion [[Break (music)|break]]s, [[bassline]]s and other musical content [[sampling (music)|sampled]] from pre-existing records. In hip hop, rappers and MCs use these beats to [[rapping|rap]] over.\n\n{{Duplication|section=yes}}\nDJs use equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]]. This allows the DJ to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms do not clash when they are played together, either so two records can be played at the same time, or to enable the DJ to make a smooth transition from one song to another. An important tool for DJs is the specialized [[DJ mixer]], a small [[audio console|audio mixer]] with a [[crossfader]]  and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions. The crossfader enables the DJ to blend or transition from one song to another. The cue knobs or switches allow the DJ to \"listen\" to a source of recorded music in [[headphones]] before playing it for the live club or broadcast audience. Previewing the music in headphones helps the DJ pick the next track they want to play, [[cue (audio)|cue up]] the track to the desired starting location, and align the two tracks' beats in traditional situations where auto sync technology is not being used. This process ensures that the selected song will mix well with the currently playing music. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects; and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.\n\nThe title \"DJ\" is also often used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted [[pseudonym]]s or [[stage name]]s as a title to denote their profession (e.g., [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[DJ Qbert]], [[DJ Shadow]] and [[DJ Yoda]]). Some DJs focus on creating a good mix of songs for the club dancers or radio audience. Other DJs use [[turntablism]] techniques such as [[scratching]], in which the DJ or [[turntablism|turntablist]] manipulates the [[phonograph|record player turntable]] to create new rhythms and sounds. DJs need to have a mixture of artistic and technical skills for their profession, because they have to understand both the creative aspects of making new musical beats and tracks, and the technical aspects of using [[mixing console]]s, professional audio equipment, [[digital audio workstation]]s and other computerized music gear. In many types of DJing, including club DJing and radio/TV DJing, a DJ also has to have [[charisma]] and develop a good rapport with the audience. Professional DJs often specialize in a specific genre of music, such as [[techno]], [[house music|house]] or [[hip hop music|hip hop]] music. DJs typically have an extensive knowledge about the music they specialize in. Many DJs are avid music collectors of vintage, rare or obscure tracks and records.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Radio DJs===\n{{Main|Radio personality}}\n\nRadio DJs or [[radio personality|radio personalities]] introduce and play music broadcast on [[AM broadcasting|AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[Digital radio|digital]] or [[Internet radio]] stations.\n\n===Club DJs===\n[[File:Pete Rock @ The Brookyln Bowl in 2016.jpg|thumbnail|right|\nDJ [[Pete Rock]] performing at Razel and Friends - Brooklyn Bowl, 2016]]\nClub DJs, commonly referred as DJs in general, play music at musical events, such as parties at [[Nightclub|music venues]] or [[bar]]s, [[music festival]]s, corporate and private events. Typically, club DJs mix music recordings from two or more sources using different mixing techniques in order to produce non-stopping flow of music. One key technique used for seamlessly transitioning from one song to another is [[beatmatching]]. A DJ who mostly plays and mixes one specific music genre is often given the title of that genre; for example, a DJ who plays hip hop music is called a hip hop DJ, a DJ who plays house music is a house DJ, a DJ who plays techno is called a techno DJ, and so on. The quality of a DJ performance (often called a DJ mix or DJ set) consists of two main features: technical skills, or how well can DJ operate the equipment and produce smooth transitions between two or more recordings and a playlist; and the ability of a DJ to select most suitable recordings, also known as \"reading the crowd\".<ref>[https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2011/12/how-to-read-a-crowd-and-what-happens-if-you-dont/ How To Read A Crowd (And What Happens If You Don\u2019t)], ''Digital DJ Tips'', 3 November 2017</ref>\n\n===Turntablists===\n{{Main|Turntablism}}\n\nTurntablists, also called battle DJs, use [[Phonograph|turntables]] and [[DJ mixer]] to manipulate recorded sounds in order to produce new music.  In essence, they use DJ equipment as a musical instrument. The most known turntablist technique is [[scratching]].

Traditionally, DJs used two [[turntable]]s plugged into a [[DJ mixer]] to mix music on vinyl records. As [[compact disc]]s became popular media for publishing music, specialized high quality CD players known as [[CDJ]]s were developed for DJs. CDJs can take the place of turntables or be used together with turntables. Many CDJs can now play digital music files from [[USB flash drive]]s or [[Secure Digital|SD cards]] in addition to CDs. With the spread of portable [[laptop]], [[tablet computer|tablet]], and [[smartphone]] computers, DJs began using software together with specialized [[sound card]]s and [[DJ controller]] hardware. DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer or be used instead of a hardware mixer.\n\n===Turntables===\n{{Main|Turntablism}}\n[[Turntable]]s allow DJs to play vinyl records. By adjusting the playback speed of the turntable, either by adjusting the speed knob, or by manipulating the platter (e.g., by slowing down the platter by putting a finger gently along the side), DJs can match the [[tempo]]s of different records so their rhythms can be played together at the same time without clashing or make a smooth, seamless transition from one song to another. This technique is known as [[beatmatching]]. DJs typically replace the rubber mat on turntables that keeps the record moving in sync with the turntable with a [[slipmat]] that facilitates manipulating the playback of the record by hand. With the slipmat, the DJ can stop or slow down the record while the turntable is still spinning. [[Direct-drive turntable]]s are the type preferred by DJs, with the [[Technics SL-1200]] being the most popular model of turntables for DJs. Belt-drive turntables are less expensive, but they are not suitable for turntablism and DJing, because the belt-drive motor does not like being slowed down, as it can stretch out the belt. Some DJs, most commonly those who play [[hip hop]] music, go beyond merely mixing records and use turntables as musical instruments for [[scratching]], [[beat juggling]], and other [[turntablism]] techniques.\n\n===CDJs===\n{{Main|CDJ}}\nCDJs are high quality digital media players made for DJing. They often have large jog wheels and [[pitch control]]s to allow DJs to manipulate the playback of digital files for [[beatmatching]] similar to how DJs manipulate vinyl records on turntables. CDJs often have features such as loops and waveform displays similar to DJ software. Originally designed to play music from [[compact disc]]s, they now can play digital music files stored on [[USB flash drive]]s and [[Secure Digital|SD card]]s. Some CDJs can also connect to a computer running DJ software to act as a [[DJ controller]].\n\n===DJ mixers===\n{{Main|DJ mixer}}\n[[File:DJ Mixer.JPG|thumb|upright|right|A [[Numark (DJ equipment)|Numark]] DM2002X Pro Master DJ mixer. This three channel mixer can have up to three input sound sources. The [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] control knobs and [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] control knobs allow the volume and tone of each sound source to be adjusted. The vertical faders allow for further adjustment of the volume of each sound source. The horizontally-mounted [[crossfader (audio engineering)|crossfader]] enables the DJ to smoothly transition from a [[song]] on one sound source to a song from a different sound source.]]\nDJ mixers are small audio [[mixing console]]s specialized for DJing. Most DJ mixers have far fewer channels than a mixer used by a [[record producer]] or [[audio engineer]]; whereas standard live sound mixers in small venues have 12 to 24 channels, and standard [[recording studio]] mixers have even more (as many as 72 on large boards), basic DJ mixers may have only two channels. While DJ mixers have many of the same features found on larger mixers (faders, equalization knobs, gain knobs, [[effects unit]]s, etc.), DJ mixers have a feature that is usually only found on DJ mixers: the [[crossfader]]. The crossfader is a type of fader that is mounted horizontally. DJs used the crossfader to mix two or more sound sources. The midpoint of the crossfader's travel is a 50/50 mix of the two channels (on a two channel mixer). The far left side of the crossfader provides only the channel A sound source. The far right side provides only the channel B sound source (e.g., record player number 2). Positions in between the two extremes provide different mixes of the two channels. Some DJs use a computer with DJ software and a [[DJ controller]] instead of an analog DJ mixer to mix music, although DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer.\n\n===Headphones===\n{{Main|Headphones}}\nDJs generally use higher quality headphones than those designed for music consumers. DJ headphones have other properties useful for DJs, such as designs that acoustically isolate the sounds of the headphones from the outside environment (hard shell headphones), flexible headbands and pivot joints to allow DJs to listen to one side of the headphones, while turning the other headphone away (so he/she can monitor the mix in the club), and replaceable cables. Replaceable cables enables DJs to buy new cables if a cable becomes frayed, worn, or damaged, or if a cable is accidentally cut.\n\nClosed-back headphones are highly recommended for DJs to block outside noise as the environment of DJ usually tend to be very noisy. Standard headphones have 3.5mm jack but DJ equipment usually requires \u00bc inch jack. Most of specialized DJ Headphones have an adapter to switch between 3.5mm jack and \u00bc inch jack. Detachable coiled cables are perfect for DJ Headphones.<ref>{{Citation | url=http://www.getaheadphone.com/the-5-best-dj-headphones-of-2016/|title = Best DJ Headphones| accessdate =27 October 2016|year=2016|author=GetAHeadphone}}</ref>\n\n===Software===\n{{See also|List of music software#DJ software}}\n[[File:Mixxx-1.11.0-Deere.png|thumb|left|A [[screenshot]] of [[Mixxx]] DJ software running on [[Mac OS X]]]]\n\nDJs have changed their equipment as new technologies are introduced. The earliest DJs in pop music, in 1970s discos, used [[phonograph|record turntable]]s, vinyl records and [[audio console]]s. In the 1970s, DJs would have to lug heavy direct drive turntables and crates of records to clubs and shows. In the 1980s, many DJs transitioned to [[compact cassette]]s. In the 1990s and 2000s, many DJs switched to using [[digital audio]] such as [[CD]]s and [[MP3]] files. As technological advances made it practical to store large collections of digital music files on a [[laptop]] computer, DJ software was developed so DJs could use a laptop as a source of music instead of transporting CDs or vinyl records to gigs. Unlike most [[media player (software)|music player software]] designed for [[consumer electronics|regular consumers]], DJ software can play at least two audio files simultaneously, display the [[waveform]]s of the files on screen and enable the DJ to listen to either source.\n\nThe waveforms allow the DJ see what is coming next in the music and how the playback of different files is aligned. The software analyzes music files to identify their tempo and where the beats are. The analyzed information can be used by the DJ to help manually [[beatmatch]] like with vinyl records or the software can automatically synchronize the beats. [[Digital signal processing]] algorithms in software allow DJs to adjust the [[tempo]] of recordings independently of their [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (and musical [[key (music)|key]], a feature known as \"keylock\". Some software analyzes the loudness of the music for automatic normalization with [[ReplayGain]] and detects the musical key. Additionally, DJ software can store cue points, set loops, and apply [[effects unit|effects]].\n\nAs [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became widespread, DJ software was written to run on these devices in addition to laptops.\nDJ software requires specialized hardware in addition to a computer to fully take advantage of its features. The consumer grade, regular [[sound card]] integrated into most computer motherboards can only output two channels (one stereo pair). However, DJs need to be able to output at least four channels (two stereo pairs, thus Left and Right for input 1 and Left and Right for input 2), either unmixed signals to send to a DJ mixer or a main output plus a headphone output. Additionally, DJ sound cards output higher quality signals than the sound cards built into consumer-grade computer motherboards.\n\n===Timecode===\nSpecial vinyl records (or CDs/digital files played with [[CDJ]]s) can be used with DJ software to play digital music files with DJ software as if they were pressed onto vinyl, allowing [[turntablism]] techniques to be used with digital files. These vinyl records do not have music recordings pressed on to them. Instead, they are pressed with a special signal, referred to as \"timecode\", to control DJ software. The DJ software interprets changes in the playback speed, direction, and position of the timecode signal and manipulates the digital files it is playing in the same way that the turntable manipulates the timecode record.\n\nThis requires a specialized DJ [[sound card]] with at least 4 channels (2 stereo pairs) of inputs and outputs. With this setup, the DJ software typically outputs unmixed signals from the music files to an external hardware [[DJ mixer]]. Some DJ mixers have integrated [[USB]] sound cards that allow DJ software to connect directly to the mixer without requiring a separate sound card.\n\n===DJ controllers===\n{{Main|DJ controller}}\nDJ software can be used to mix audio files on the computer instead of a separate hardware mixer. When mixing on a computer, DJs often use a [[DJ controller]] device that mimics the layout of two turntables plus a DJ mixer to control the software rather than the [[computer keyboard]] & [[touchpad]] on a laptop, or the [[touchscreen]] on a [[tablet computer]] or [[smartphone]]. Many DJ controllers have an integrated [[sound card]] with 4 output channels (2 stereo pairs) that allows the DJ to use headphones to preview music before playing it on the main output.<ref>{{Cite book|title=DJing for dummies|last=Steventon, John, 1975-|isbn=9781118937280|edition= 3rd|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=888464041|date = 3 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Other equipment===\n* A [[microphone]], so that the DJ can introduce songs and speak to the audience over the sound system.\n* Electronic [[effects unit]]s such as [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[reverb]], [[octave]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]], [[chorus effect|chorus]], etc.\n* Multi-stylus head shells, which allow a DJ to play different grooves of the same record at the same time.\n* [[Sampler (musical instrument)|Sampler]]s, [[Music sequencer|sequencers]], electronic musical keyboards ([[synthesizer]]s), or [[drum machine]]s.\n* [[PA system]] or [[sound reinforcement system]] ([[power amplifier]]s and [[speaker enclosure]]s), typically including [[subwoofer]] cabinets for deep bass (or, if a DJ is broadcasting and/or recording a set, broadcasting equipment or recording gear)\n*[[Foldback (sound engineering)|Monitor speaker]]s, for listening to the \"house mix\" that is playing over the main speakers\n\n==Techniques==\n[[File:DJ Grand Wizzard Theodore (right), inventor of vinyl record scratching technique.jpg|thumb|In the early 1970s in the South Bronx, a young teen DJ called [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]] invented the \"DJ scratch\" technique. Other DJs, like [[Grandmaster Flash]], took the technique to higher levels to the familiar sound and technique we hear today.]]\nSeveral techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the [[cueing (playback)|cueing]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.\n\n{{Side box|above='''DJ Techniques'''\n|text=\n[[Back spinning]]\n*[[Beat juggling]]\n*[[Beatmatching]]\n*[[Chopping (sampling technique)|Chopping]] and [[Chopped and screwed|screwing]]\n*[[Harmonic mixing]]\n*[[Loop (music)|Looping]]\n*[[Needle drop (DJing)|Needle dropping]]\n*[[Phrasing (DJ)|Phrasing]]\n*[[Scratching]]\n*[[Slip-cueing]]}}\nClub DJ turntable techniques include [[beatmatching]], [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[slip-cueing]] to preserve energy on a dance floor. [[Turntablism]] embodies the art of cutting, [[beat juggling]], [[scratching]], [[Needle drop (DJing)|needle drop]]s, [[phase shifting]], [[back spinning]] and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of [[Sampling (music)|samples]] in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a [[musical instrument]] rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use [[harmonic mixing]] to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmonic mixing: The Basics|url=http://www.harmonic-mixing.com/HowTo.aspx|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Mixes Remixes|url=http://www.surroundsounddj.com/dj-mixes-remixes/|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nRecent advances in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[beatmatching]], which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic [[synchronization]] of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled \"sync\". Most [[DJ mixer]]s now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in [[beats per minute]] (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources.\n\nIn the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815205546/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |archivedate=15 August 2014  }}</ref>\n\n===Miming===\nIn DJ culture, [[Miming in instrumental performance|miming]] refers to the practice of DJ's pantomiming the actions of live-mixing a set on stage while a pre-recorded mix plays over the sound system.<ref name=\"Fonarow2006\">Wendy Fonarow.

[[Hip hop]] DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with [[turntablism]] techniques such as [[scratching]] and [[beat juggling]] rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by [[DJ Kool Herc]], [[Grand Wizard Theodore]], and [[Afrika Bambaataa]], as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter.<ref name=\"wired\"/> Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.\n\nIn 1980, Japanese company [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] released the [[Roland TR-808|TR-808]], an analog [[Drum machine|rhythm/drum machine]], which has unique artificial sounds, such as its booming [[Bass drum|bass]] and sharp [[Snare drum|snare]], and a [[metronome]]-like [[rhythm]].

In 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player was released, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10. Final Scratch debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded vinyl records or CDs. While it would take some time for this novel concept to catch on with the \"die hard Vinyl DJs\", this would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the \"CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit\", to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.\n\nIn 2001, [[Pioneer DJ]] began producing the [[CDJ#CDJ-1000|CDJ-1000]] [[CD player]], making the use of digital music recordings with traditional DJ techniques practical for the first time. As the 2000s progressed, [[laptop]] computers became more powerful and affordable. [[#Software|DJ software]], specialized DJ [[sound card]]s, and [[DJ controller]]s were developed for DJs to use laptops as a source of music rather than turntables or CDJs. In the 2010s, like laptops before them, [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became more powerful & affordable. DJ software was written to run on these more portable devices instead of laptops, although laptops remain the more common type of computer for DJing.\n\n== Female DJs ==\nIn Western [[popular music]], [[Women in music|women musicians]] have achieved great success in singing and songwriting roles, however, there are relatively few women DJs or turntablists. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs. A 2013 ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' article stated that there are \"...few women in [[Music producer|record production]] and [[sound engineering]].\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}</ref> Ncube states that \"[n]inety-five percent of music producers are male, and although there are female producers achieving great things in music, they are less well-known than their male counterparts.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  The vast majority of students in music technology programs are male. In [[hip hop music]], the low percentage of women DJs and turntablists may stem from the overall male domination of the entire hip hop music industry. Most of the top rappers, MCs, DJs, record producers and music executives are men. There are a small number of high-profile women, but they are rare. \n[[File:Dj Virgin .jpg|thumb|left|DJ Virgin is a [[London]]-based DJ<ref name=\"DJM\">{{cite web |title=DJ VIRGIN LONDON |url=https://djanemag.com/djanes/dj-virgin-london |website=Djanemag.com |publisher=DJane Magazine |accessdate=10 January 2020}}</ref>, pictured here mixing with a Pioneer DJ Controller which can replicate the sound of vinyl record players.]]\nIn 2007 Mark Katz's article \"Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle,\" stated that \"very few women [do turntablism] battle[s]; the matter has been a topic of conversation among hip-hop DJs for years.\"<ref name=\"gender\">{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Mark|date=12 December 2007|title=Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle|url=https://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/4/580.full#fn-9|journal=The Musical Quarterly|volume=89|issue=4|pages=580\u2013599|doi=10.1093/musqtl/gdm007|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> In 2010 Rebekah Farrugia states \"the male-centricity of EDM culture\" contributes to \"a marginalisation of women in these [EDM] spaces.\" <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Dance Floor: Female DJs, Technology and Electronic Dance Music Culture|last=Farrugia|first=Rebekah|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1841505664|location=|pages=}}</ref> While turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests use or lack of use of the turntable broadly by women across genres and disciplines is impacted upon by what he defines as \"male [[technophilia]].\"<ref name=\"gender\" /> Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on engineering with this idea of socialization as a central factor in the lack of engagement with technology.

His son, [[Per S\u00f6dermark]], was also a well-known painter and [[lithographer]].\n\n==Biography== \nHe was born in [[Landskrona]]. In 1808, he became an [[Underl\u00f6jtnant]] with the Field Measurement Corps, and was primarily involved in [[cartography]]. Later, he became an [[Adjutant]] to Lieutenant General {{ill|Sixten David Sparre|sv}}. In 1813, he accompanied the Swedish Army to Germany, where he was involved in the battles of [[Battle of Grossbeeren|Grossbeeren]] and [[Battle of Leipzig (1813)|Leipzig]]. He was later transferred to Norway and was wounded twice. He received a medal for bravery and became a Major in 1816. After a long period of service with Count [[Carl Carlsson M\u00f6rner]], he was commissioned to study the site for the proposed [[Karlsborg Fortress]], draft plans, and participate in its construction. \n\nFrom 1820 to 1824, he did some of his first independent, paid work; making etchings of monuments, which were published in the literary journal, ''[[Geatish Society|Iduna]]''.<ref>[http://www.lexikonettamanda.se/show.php?aid=18857 Olof Johan S\u00f6dermark] @ Lexikonett Amanda</ref> He then left Sweden, with the intention of becoming an artist. Initially, he visited Paris, where he copied works in the museums, then went to Rome, where he lived with the sculptor, [[Johan Niclas Bystr\u00f6m]], who had invited him there. Under his guidance, and that of  \n[[Bengt Erland Fogelberg]], he studied sculpture, but eventually decided to switch to portrait painting. He remained in Rome until 1828.\n\nHe had been participating in exhibitions at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts]] since early in his military career, but his formal debut came at the exhibition of 1829. That same year, he became a teacher of [[topography]]  at the [[Military Academy Karlberg]].<ref>[http://runeberg.org/nfch/0108.html Biography] from the ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' @ [[Projekt Runeberg]]</ref> In 1832 and 1833, he painted portraits of members of the Royal Family. After that, he resigned from the {{ill|Topographical Corps|sv|Topografiska k\u00e5ren}} to devote all his time to painting.\n\nThanks to a travel scholarship, he was able to spend much of the 1830s travelling; to Paris, Rome, Munich and London.

His son, [[Per S\u00f6dermark], was also a well-known painter and [[lithographer]].\n\n==Biography== \nHe was born in [[Landskrona]]. In 1808, he became an [[Underl\u00f6jtnant]] with the Field Measurement Corps, and was primarily involved in [[cartography]]. Later, he became an [[Adjutant]] to Lieutenant General {{ill|Sixten David Sparre|sv}}. In 1813, he accompanied the Swedish Army to Germany, where he was involved in the battles of [[Battle of Grossbeeren|Grossbeeren]] and [[Battle of Leipzig (1813)|Leipzig]]. He was later transferred to Norway and was wounded twice. He received a medal for bravery and became a Major in 1816. After a long period of service with Count [[Carl Carlsson M\u00f6rner]], he was commissioned to study the site for the proposed [[Karlsborg Fortress]], draft plans, and participate in its construction. \n\nFrom 1820 to 1824, he did some of his first independent, paid work; making etchings of monuments, which were published in the literary journal, ''[[Geatish Society|Iduna]]''.<ref>[http://www.lexikonettamanda.se/show.php?aid=18857 Olof Johan S\u00f6dermark] @ Lexikonett Amanda</ref> He then left Sweden, with the intention of becoming an artist. Initially, he visited Paris, where he copied works in the museums, then went to Rome, where he lived with the sculptor, [[Johan Niclas Bystr\u00f6m]], who had invited him there. Under his guidance, and that of  \n[[Bengt Erland Fogelberg]], he studied sculpture, but eventually decided to switch to portrait painting. He remained in Rome until 1828.\n\nHe had been participating in exhibitions at the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts]] since early in his military career, but his formal debut came at the exhibition of 1829. That same year, he became a teacher of [[topography]]  at the [[Military Academy Karlberg]].<ref>[http://runeberg.org/nfch/0108.html Biography] from the ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' @ [[Projekt Runeberg]]</ref> In 1832 and 1833, he painted portraits of members of the Royal Family. After that, he resigned from the {{ill|Topographical Corps|sv|Topografiska k\u00e5ren}} to devote all his time to painting.\n\nThanks to a travel scholarship, he was able to spend much of the 1830s travelling; to Paris, Rome, Munich and London. He painted portraits of notable people at every stop. In 1841, he made his final trip, after which he lived in Stockholm until his death in 1848. \n\nHis famous sitters included King [[Charles XIV John of Sweden]], [[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]], [[Jenny Lind]], [[Stendhal]] and [[Josephine of Leuchtenberg]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Carl Gustaf Laurin, ''Konsten i Sverige'', P.A.

{"title_page": "List of Shrek characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{pp-pc1}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Shrek'' characters}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{in-universe|date=May 2013}}\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2013}}\n{{primary sources|date=May 2013}}\n}}\nThis is a list of [[Character (arts)|characters]] that appear in the ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' franchise and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] from it.\n\n==Main characters==\n\n===Shrek===\n{{Main|Shrek (character)}}\n'''Shrek''' (voiced by [[Mike Myers]], [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] as his official voice in the video games) is the lead character in of all of the films. He prides himself on being a big, green, terrifying [[ogre]] and is ill-tempered and rude. He begins the series as an unsociable hermit until he meets his soon-to-be best friend, Donkey. In a deal with Lord Farquaad, he and Donkey embark on a quest to save Princess Fiona from the castle in which she was confined. Despite their differences, Shrek and Fiona fall in love, marry at the end of the first film, and have three ogre babies in the third film. [[Chris Farley]] was originally set to play Shrek, but he died before he could complete his voice work (he finished 80-90% of the film or according to his brother Tom, 95%).\n\nIn ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space]]'', a woman mistakes The Missing Link as Shrek.\n\n===Donkey===\n{{Main|Donkey (Shrek)}}\n'''Donkey''' (voiced by [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Mark Moseley (actor)|Mark Moseley]] as his official voice in the video games, and [[Dean Edwards]] in ''[[Scared Shrekless]]'') is a talking [[donkey]]. He is cheerful, talkative, optimistic, irritating, hypochondriac and half worried, but kind-hearted and brave when need be. He escaped being sold by his owner, an old woman, and eventually met and allied with Shrek. He is Shrek's best friend, but it always bothers or irritates the ogre. He has also become the frequent companion of the honorable mercenary Puss In Boots, although the two always fight or disagree from one another. Donkey loves to sing and hum, as seen in all the franchise films. He is also the Dragon's husband and father of the Dronkeys, whose passion for sweets inspired the name of each one of them.\n\n===Princess Fiona===\n{{Main|Princess Fiona}}\n'''Princess Fiona''' (voiced by [[Cameron Diaz]], singing voice provided by [[Sally Dworsky]] in the first film, [[Renee Sands]] on all other occasions, and [[Holly Fields]] in the video games) is the princess of Far Far Away, the daughter of late King Harold and Queen Lillian, cousin of King Arthur Pendragon, and Shrek's wife from the end of the first film on. She begins the series as a beautiful princess who transforms into an [[ogre]]ss every night when the sun sets. At the end of the first film, the transforming spell is broken and she permanently takes the form of an ogress when she realizes that Shrek is her true love.\n\n===Puss In Boots===\n{{Main|Puss In Boots (Shrek)}}\n'''Puss In Boots''' (voiced by [[Antonio Banderas]] in the English, Spanish, and Italian versions of the films, [[Eric Bauza]] in ''The Adventures of Puss In Boots'', vocal sounds and purrs were provided by [[Frank Welker]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]] in the video games and commercials) is Shrek's best friend along with Donkey. Loosely based on the [[fairy tale]] character [[Puss In Boots]] as well as being a kind of parody of [[Zorro]], he is a smooth-talking cat with a Spanish accent, usually wearing a cavalier's hat, a belt with a sword, a small black cape, and small Corinthian leather boots. Puss first appears in ''[[Shrek 2]]'', much like Dragon in the first film. He often overpowers his enemies by distracting them with his \"cute kitten\" looks. He also exhibits common cat behavior such as coughing up [[hairball]]s and chasing lights, usually resulting in his defeat or capture. For obvious reasons, he does not appear in [[Shrek|the first film]] or [[Shrek 4-D|4D ride]], though he does make a non-speaking cameo in the [[Shrek The Musical|musical]].\n\nThe character was also featured in the 2011 film ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss In Boots]]'' as the lead character.\n\nPuss In Boots stars in the [[Netflix]] series ''[[The Adventures of Puss in Boots]]'', where he protects the hidden city of San Lorenzo.\n\n==Secondary characters==\n\n===Dragon===\n'''Dragon''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) is depicted as a ruby-colored dragon who debuts as a ferocious guard challenging Shrek and Donkey in their quest to locate Princess Fiona. She is angered when Donkey accidentally disturbs her sleep and as Donkey attempts to distract her, he comes to the realization that Dragon is female, and successfully manages to charm his way to her heart. Though initially he is terrified of Dragon and wants nothing to do with her, Donkey later changes his mind and decides to give her a chance after he sees her crying over his rejection. While she plays a major role in this film, she reappears towards its conclusion at the marriage ceremony of Fiona and Shrek, in which Donkey takes her as his own mate. They are shown as a married couple by the events of the [[sequel]]; her character has a major role as Donkey chooses to leave home on the grounds that she was behaving uncharacteristically ill-tempered, but is reunited with her husband towards the ending of the movie when it appears that her grouchy behavior was a result of [[pregnancy]], and presents Donkey with their newborn hybrid children, the Dronkeys.\n\nDragon's importance in the films has been known to shift and revert every now and again, she is usually depicted as Donkey's romantic interest, and seems to be acquainted with Fiona and the princesses featured in the films. She often appears as a running gag because of the convenient possibilities presented by her abilities, albeit she can serve as an effective means of protection because of these as well (such as her consumption of Farquaad towards the end of the first film, which Donkey insists in ''Scared Shrekless'' was an accident). A silent character, Dragon has no spoken lines throughout the course of the franchise, though other characters, including Donkey, are able to somewhat understand her language when she communicates through hushed roars.\n\nDragon appears in all 4 ''Shrek'' movies and ''[[Shrek 4-D]]''. She is notably absent from ''Scared Shrekless'' and ''Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular'', and neither was she mentioned in the latter film.\n\n===The Gingerbread Man===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[The Gingerbread Man (Shrek)]] -->\nThe '''[[The Gingerbread Man|Gingerbread Man]]''' (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]]) is a live talking [[gingerbread man]] and one of Shrek's friends. He is also known as \"Gingy\" and was created by [[#The Muffin Man|The Muffin Man]]. He is small and a fast runner, making him difficult to catch. He is made out of a normal carved-out gingerbread with icing and gumdrop buttons. He adores those buttons and begs Lord Farquaad not to pull them off. In ''Shrek the Halls'' he is afraid of Santa, who has eaten his girlfriend.\n\nIn the first film, he is first seen when Lord Farquaad ordered his bodyguard Thelonious to torture him in numerous ways, such as cutting off both of his legs and dunking him in a glass of milk. After an [[interrogation]] from Farquaad, he is thrown into a trash can when the Magic Mirror arrives and Gingy yells \"Don't tell him anything!\"\n\nHe is impatient. In ''Shrek 2'', for example, when Pinocchio could not move himself while freeing Shrek and the trio from prison, Gingy sighs, and goes to help. He is also somewhat wild, and a prankster. When Shrek and Fiona leave for Far Far Away, he and others have a loud party in his house. He is cunning and can distract others, such as when Lord Farquaad demands to know where the other fairy tale creatures are and he replies by reciting the [[The Muffin Man|Muffin Man nursery rhyme]], which Farquaad believes for a moment.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', when Prince Charming takes over Far Far Away, he has Hook attempt to intimidate him to reveal Shrek's whereabouts. Instantly, Gingy's life flashes before his eyes, while in reality, he is mindlessly babbling away.\n\nIn ''Shrek Forever After'', he is shown to have a dark, violent side. In an alternate universe with Rumpelstiltskin as king, he fights and kills gingerbread animals as a gladiator for a living. He also tries to attack and bring in Shrek for Rumpel, despite being so much smaller. He is eaten by an overweight Puss in Boots in the alternate universe, but is seen alive again at the ogre triplets birthday party when the original timeline is restored.\n\n===King Arthur Pendragon{{anchor|Arthur_Pendragon}}===\n'''[[King Arthur|Arthur Pendragon]]''' (voiced by [[Justin Timberlake]]) [[James Arnold Taylor]] in videogames is the current king of Far Far Away, cousin of Princess Fiona, cousin-in-law of Shrek, and nephew of Queen Lillian and the late King Harold. Arthur is a supporting character who only appears in ''Shrek the Third'' and is loosely based on [[King Arthur]]. He is the only heir apparent to the throne of Far Far Away. His father abandoned him at the high school Worcestershire, where he remains until Shrek finds him.\n\nAt Worcestershire, Arthur, nicknamed Artie, is relentlessly bullied and made fun of by everyone, most notably the popular [[Lancelot]]. He is at first unsure when confronted with the trials of being king, but gets used to the idea and manages to convince people to his way of thinking when he defends and saves Shrek from the fairy tale villains. After Prince Charming's defeat, Shrek gives him the choice to do so. then Artie puts the crown on his head and begins his reign as King of Far Far Away.\n\nArtie does not appear in ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' and is never mentioned. He was supposed to appear, but Justin Timberlake was unavailable to voice Artie because he was on tour, so he was absent from the film.\n\n=== {{Anchor|Big Bad Wolf}}The Big Bad Wolf ===\nThe '''[[Big Bad Wolf]]''' (voiced by [[Aron Warner]]) [[James Arnold Taylor]] in videogames is based loosely on the eponymous fairytale character, but differs from it by being a kind character. He rarely speaks, and when he does, his voice is somewhat dull and monotonous. He wears a pink dress, recalling the grandmother of [[Little Red Riding Hood]]. In the first film, he is among the fairy-tale creatures who are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\nIn ''Shrek 2'', he has become friends with Shrek and the others. In the film's intro, Prince Charming goes to Fiona's castle to rescues her but finds Wolf in her bed. He informs Charming that Fiona is on honeymoon with Shrek (Charming and Fairy Godmother mention this incident calling Wolf a 'gender-confused wolf'). He helps Shrek and Princess Fiona by guarding their swamp while they visit Far Far Away. He and the others later travel to Far Far Away to free Shrek, Puss In Boots and Donkey, who have been captured. After that, they get into the castle and stop the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', he and several other fairytale characters attend Fiona's baby shower while Shrek, Donkey, and Puss In Boots are away. When Charming and his evil followers crash the party, the Big Bad Wolf and the others stage a calm tea party. He also helps prevent Charming and the other evil fairytale creatures from killing Shrek in front of the entire kingdom.\n\nHe plays a small role in ''Shrek Forever After'' in the ogre triplets' birthday party and as Rumpelstiltskin's servant in the alternate universe.\n\nIn ''The Pig Who Cried Werewolf'', it is shown that in the light of a full moon, he transforms\u2014werewolf-style\u2014into a fat, female human chef who wants to cook the Three Little Pigs. (Just as the full moon would transform a human into a werewolf, it apparently goes the other way with Wolf, transforming him into a human.)\n\n===Three Little Pigs===\nThe '''[[Three Little Pigs]]''' (voiced by [[Cody Cameron]]) are friends of Shrek. In the original book and in the film, they are among the many fairytale creatures to be banished into Shrek's swamp by [[Lord Farquaad]]. One of the pigs stated that Lord Farquaad \"huffed and puffed and signed an eviction notice.\" They all have German accents. They appear in all the ''Shrek'' films.\n\nBy ''Shrek 2'', the pigs have become best friends with Shrek. At the start of the film, they help look after Shrek's and Fiona's house while they visit Far Far Away. Later, they see Shrek, Donkey and Puss In Boots arrested by local police officers in Far Far Away, and free them, heading to the castle to stop Prince Charming. They thwart the Fairy Godmother's scheme and then celebrate. They sing a song with Wolf Wolf in ''Far Far Away Idol''.\n\nThe pigs are less prominent in the third film. They appear at the start of the film, where Prince Charming has a new job as an actor in a dinner theatre. Along with the rest of the crowd, they jeer him, causing Charming to leave the stage. They later appear in the castle pretending to have tea with the others while Shrek, Donkey and Puss In Boots are finding Artie, the heir to the throne, and Fiona, Queen Lillian and the princesses escape via a secret passage. Prince Charming storms in and demands Shrek's location. Under pressure when Pinocchio starts talking around in circles, one of the pigs reveals Shrek's plan and ends up locked up somewhere secret. The pigs are later freed and head to the castle to stop Prince Charming from killing Shrek in his show.\n\nThe Three Little Pigs play a small part in ''Shrek Forever After'', when they appear at the ogre triplet's birthday party. Later, in the alternate universe, they appear as attendants to Fifi in Rumpelstiltskin's castle.\n\nIn ''[[Scared Shrekless]]'', they appear after Gingy's story, running quickly and yelling \"wee wee wee...\", upon which the Wolf comments \"They're gonna do that all the way home.\"\n\nIn the end credits for ''The Pig Who Cried Werewolf'', it is revealed that their names are Heimlich, Dieter, and Horst. In this film, they are voiced by Sean Bishop, not Cody Cameron, who voices \"Horst\". Aron Warner still voices Wolf.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek The Musical]]'', they have had enough of Lord Farquaad and his discrimination towards fairy tale creatures and join the rest of the fairy tale rebels in this story mainly appearing in \"Story of my Life,\" \"Freak Flag,\" \"I'm a Believer,\" \"This is Our Story,\" and any other numbers with the fairy tale creatures.\n\n===Pinocchio===\n'''[[Pinocchio]]''' (voiced by [[Cody Cameron]]) is a live wooden [[puppet]] and one of Shrek's best friends. He could not lie without having his nose growing very long, and he deeply dreams to become a real boy.\n\nIn the first film, he is sold for five shillings by his creator, [[Mister Geppetto|Geppetto]]. Later, Lord Farquaad banishes Pinocchio and others to Shrek's swamp. In ''Shrek 2'', Pinocchio has become one of Shrek's best friends. He helps Shrek and [[Princess Fiona]] by guarding their swamp while they visit Far Far Away. He and the others later travel to Far Far Away to free Shrek, Puss In Boots, and Donkey, who have been captured. They manage to get into the castle and stop the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming. After trying to grab the Fairy Godmother's wand, she zaps him with it and he turns into a real boy, but when the wand is passed to The Three Blind Mice it transforms Pinocchio back into a puppet. He sings \"[[Mr. Roboto]]\" in ''[[Far Far Away Idol]]''.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', Pinocchio attends Fiona's baby shower along with several other fairytale creatures, while Shrek, Donkey, and Puss In Boots are away. Charming and his followers crash the party and try to trick Pinocchio into telling them of Shrek's location, seeing that the puppet cannot lie; however, Pinocchio avoids this by talking in circles. When Shrek and his company return, they find Pinocchio imprisoned in a miniature theater, where he is forced to give marionette performances for paying customers. He is freed and helps to defeat Charming and the other evil fairytale creatures.\n\nIn ''Shrek Forever After'', Pinocchio runs a library, in which Rumpelstiltskin is angrily tearing the pages of a book. Noticing that, he warns him that he has to pay for the damaged book. When Rumplestiltskin tries to deceive him by offering him a deal to become a real boy, Pinocchio kicks him out of the library, calling him \"Stinky-pants\" before he slams the door. Later, in the alternate universe, he nearly signs a contract with Rumpelstiltskin to become a real boy, but ink is accidentally spilled over the document. He later tries to gain Rumpelstiltskin's \"deal of a lifetime\" by painting Geppetto green and passing him off as Shrek.\n\nPinocchio is a main character in ''[[Shrek SuperSlam]]'', his Slam move being the Buzz Bomber. According to the story, Pinocchio works at Friar's Fat Boy. Pinocchio also appears as an unlockable racer in the game ''[[Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing]]''. His kart is a wooden horse, and his personal item is his long nose.\n\nIn the ''Shrek'' musical, Pinocchio was originally performed by [[John Tartaglia]]. Also during the musical, Pinocchio, with the help of the Fairytale Creatures, learns the meaning of being true to yourself; and the meaning of what makes a family.\n\nIn ''Scared Shrekless'', he talks faster than any other film. He appears in the last story called \"The Shreksorcist.\" In one part, he is acting to sleep and then Shrek cuts his strings using adult scissors causing him to fall on the bed and Pinocchio explains that he has voices in his head and Shrek asks what do the voices tell him to do and Pinocchio projectile vomits at Shrek. In the end, the voice in Pinocchio's head was [[The Talking Cricket|a cricket]] who explains that he put all the thoughts in his head because he is his conscience, at which point Pinocchio steps on and crushes him.\n\n===Three Blind Mice===\nThe '''[[Three Blind Mice]]''' (voiced by [[Christopher Knights]] and [[Simon J. Smith]] in most films, [[Mike Myers]] in ''Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party'') are a trio of identical blind [[mouse|mice]] brothers with English accents that are friends with Shrek and the others. They are all blind, and that is why they sport black sunglasses and carry canes. Unlike in the fairy tale, their tails are not cut off and they do not display signs of injuries. Their names are Forder, Gorder and Horder.\n\nAt the beginning of the first film, Lord Farquaad banishes them to Shrek's swamp with the others. They are not seen again until the final musical number, \"[[I'm a Believer]]\", during which the fairies of Sleeping Beauty turn two of them into horses to pull a wagon made from an onion.\n\nBefore the start of ''Shrek 2'', the Three Blind Mice have become three of Shrek's best friends. They help Shrek and Princess Fiona by guarding their swamp while they visit Far Far Away. They are later seen during the Royal Far Far Away Ball and again when Shrek (in his human form) is thrown into a police truck. On hearing this, the Blind Mice and the others travel to Far Far Away to free Shrek, Puss In Boots and Donkey. They then get into the castle and help to stop the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming. They later appear in ''Far Far Away Idol'', singing \"[[I Can See Clearly Now]].\"\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', the Three Blind Mice only appear in two scenes: during the funeral of King Harold, and when Shrek is about to leave to find the new king of Far Far Away.\n\nIn ''Shrek Forever After'', the mice are only seen in the normal universe.\n\n===Dronkeys===\n'''Dronkeys''' are the hybrid offspring of Dragon and Donkey. They are introduced in ''Shrek 2'' as little more than a [[post-credits scene|stinger gag]]. Audience members missed having [[Dragon (Shrek)|Dragon]] in the film, as was revealed to the filmmakers during test screenings.<ref>{{cite video| people = [[Andrew Adamson]], [[Kelly Asbury]]| title = [[Shrek 2]]|medium = DVD|publisher = [[DreamWorks Animation]]|date = 2004}}</ref> Dragon reunites with Donkey in Far Far Away, only to have a surprise for him in tow\u2014six young hybrid donkey-dragon children, who take to their father immediately. Donkey is delighted, and dubs the dronkeys \"our little mutant babies\". Their names are revealed to be Eclair, Bananas, Peanut, Parfait, Coco and Debbie.\n\nThe dronkeys have very little screen time in ''Shrek the Third''. They appear initially to give Shrek a wake up call, then to bid farewell to Donkey before his journey with Shrek. Near the film's climax, Donkey frees them from Prince Charming's capture. In addition, a few dronkeys make an appearance at the film's close, when Shrek and Fiona are caring for their [[#Farkle, Fergus, and Felicia|newborn triplets]]. In the alternate universe, when Donkey is told he has children, he asks: \"Tell me, are my babies cute, or do they just make people feel uncomfortable?\"\n\nThe dronkeys provide background action in the Christmas television special. They are featured playing with the ogre children of Shrek and Fiona and flying around while their mother dances. They have antlers and fly around in [[Shrek (franchise)#Donkey\u2019s Caroling Christmas-tacular|Donkey's Christmas story]]. All the dronkeys love their parents, especially their father, and seem to have become good friends with the ogre triplets.\n\nThe only individual to be given any semblance of a personality is Bananas, who has bright green [[Iris (anatomy)|irises]] that are noticeably [[Strabismus|wall-eyed]], and frequently sneezes small tongues of flame. [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] refers to Bananas as \"my special boy\".\n\nSome confusion exists as to why one dronkey is missing in ''Shrek The Third''. When the dronkeys were first introduced in the post-credits scene of \"Shrek 2\", there were six, including a unique individual which was red like her mother. She does not appear in ''Shrek the Third''; this is seemingly a [[continuity (fiction)|continuity error]] on the part of the filmmakers.\n\nIn ''Shrek Forever After'', the dronkeys are seen playing with Shrek's children, appeared at their birthday and also a cause of nuisance for Shrek. They are not seen in the alternate universe as they do not exist on that timeline.\n\nThe Dronkeys were absent from ''Scared Shrekless'', and neither were they mentioned.\n\n===Farkle, Fergus, and Felicia===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Ogre Triplets (Shrek)]] -->\n'''Farkle, Fergus and Felicia''' (also known as the '''Ogre Babies''' or '''Ogre Triplets''') are the [[ogre]] children of Shrek and Princess Fiona. Farkle (indicated by the tuft of hair) and Fergus are male, and Felicia is female (indicated by a pink bow in her hair).\n\nJust as many minor characters are members of the staff crew, the Ogre Triplets are voiced by offspring of staff crew, gender of voice not always same as actor: Jordan Alexander Hauser, Dante James Hauser, Jasper Johannes Andrews, Zachary James Bernard, Miles Christopher Bakshi, Nina Zoe Bakshi and Ollie Mitchell (son of ''Shrek Forever After'' director Mike Mitchell).<ref>asin B002ZG9904 Shrek Ever After DVD Extras Director Commentary</ref>\n\nIn ''Shrek 2'' when Queen Lillian asks Shrek how he and Fiona will raise their family, Shrek insists it's too early to discuss this issue. In ''Shrek the Third'', Fiona tries to talk Shrek into the possibility of parenthood by saying when they return to their swamp, there could be some little \"ogre feet\" too, but Shrek is too worried about his inexperience as a parent to pursue this idea right now. Just as Shrek embarks on a journey with Donkey and Puss in Boots to find Artie, Fiona announces to Shrek that she is pregnant, and Shrek begins to panic internally. During the journey, Shrek dreams of hundreds of ogre babies, constantly getting into danger and him having trouble saving them. In the dream, they flood Shrek's house and laugh at Shrek while he is naked apart from a graduation hat. He wakes up in another dream, where Donkey and Puss's faces have turned to that of the ogre babies. Shrek wakes up screaming and reveals to Puss and Donkey how shocked he is by this news. Donkey attempts to assure Shrek fatherhood will not ruin his life. Shrek says he is worried about ruining his child's life as ogres aren't known for being loving and nurturing. His fears prove to be well-founded when he reveals to Artie his own abusive father, who tried to eat him. By the end of the film, they have been born and are shown playing around the swamp, Shrek and Fiona getting used to being their parents, with the help of Puss, Lillian, Donkey and Dragon.\n\nTwo of them pull Puss's tail and put a pacifier into his mouth. Another pulls some ear wax from Shrek's ear and uses it to draw pictures with its left hand. Later that night, they are shown sleeping and snoring, all in one small baby cot. Shrek and Fiona constantly give them slug juice for drinks. The ogre babies are shown prominently in the credits, along with Puss in Boots and Donkey. Two of the siblings are shown to like Puss, hugging him tightly and call him \"Kitty\". Puss is displeased when they use him for tug-o-war.\n\nThey are seen more in ''Shrek the Halls'', enjoying the seasons with their father and ecstatically enjoying their first Christmas with their parents. When Donkey brings the others to enjoy the holidays with them, the ogre babies hug Puss too tightly, pat his back, and tug on his tail. They enjoy various Christmas stories and get to see [[Santa Claus]] at the end.\n\nThe triplets do not appear in the alternate universe in ''Shrek Forever After'' as Shrek and Fiona meet, but do not marry in that universe. Shrek later finds Felicia's doll in his pocket, causing him to cry. As Shrek begins to fade away as his day is up, he tells Fiona about their children, just before she kisses him, restoring the timeline.\n\nIn ''Scared Shrekless'', they appear at the beginning, scaring the trick or treaters in their skeleton costume. They are later seen along with their father, using the three in a knight armor in Duloc, in order to make Donkey believe that Lord Farquaad's ghost is there as a prank.\n\n===Queen Lillian===\n'''[[Queen consort|Queen]] Lillian''' (voiced by [[Julie Andrews]]<ref name=\"movieweb.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/24/1024/gal1610/20.php|title=Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews) and King Harold (John Cleese) learn that they may rule the kingdom, but they don't rule their daughter's heart|work=MovieWeb|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"film.guardian.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/pictures/image/0,8545,-10304954831,00.html|title=Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews) and King Harold (John Cleese)|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref>) is the queen of Far Far Away, widow of King Harold, mother of Princess Fiona, aunt of King Arthur Pendragon, grandmother of the ogre triplets, and mother in-law of Shrek.\n\nQueen Lillian makes her debut in ''Shrek 2''. Although initially surprised at Fiona's transformation into an ogre, she is understanding of what has happened and, seeing that her daughter is deeply in love and happy, accepts Shrek into their family. When King Harold is turned back into the Frog King at the end of the film, she still accepts him as she did years ago. She and Harold are a reference to ''[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]''.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', she is widowed and becomes a more determined character, leading the pack of princesses through a series of tunnels in the castle and breaking two walls with her head, whilst humming \"[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]\" and \"[[A Spoonful of Sugar]]\" (songs originally sung by Julie Andrews in ''The Sound of Music'' and ''Mary Poppins'', respectively). She rallies the other princesses from being damsels in distress to independent fighters. It is revealed in the film that Fiona inherited her fighting skills from her mother (Lillian asks \"Well, you didn't think you got your fighting skills from your father, did you?\"). After the film's finale, Lillian is seen in Shrek's swamp home, happily visiting her grandchildren and playing with Farkle, who throws up on her dress. At first she is shocked, but this changes as she comes to find it adorable.\n\nShe appears at her grandchildren's birthday party in \"Shrek Forever After\" and gets angry when she thinks that it was Shrek who licked the birthday cake, when it in fact was Donkey. Lillian is also seen in a number of flashbacks, showing her and Harold's decision to visit Rumpelstiltskin to free their daughter from the curse before getting the news that she had been saved. In the alternate universe she and Harold disappear after signing over the kingdom to Rumpelstiltskin. Her last appearance is at the end of the film, still celebrating the children's birthday.\n\nIn ''Thriller Night'', Shrek and his family watch ''The Music of Sound'', starring Queen Lillian. This is a parody of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' which starred Queen Lillian's voice actress, Julie Andrews.\n\n===King Harold===\n'''[[King]] Harold''' (voiced by [[John Cleese]]) was the king of Far Far Away, late husband of Queen Lillian,<ref name=\"movieweb.com\"/><ref name=\"film.guardian.co.uk\"/> late father of Princess Fiona, late uncle of King Arthur Pendragon, and late father in-law of Shrek.\n\nKing Harold makes his debut in ''Shrek 2''. When his daughter Fiona arrives at the castle with her new husband, he is surprised and appalled that they are both ogres. He had secretly made a promise to the Fairy Godmother that her son Prince Charming would marry Fiona. Harold hires Puss In Boots to assassinate Shrek, but then succumbs to guilt when Fiona finds out that Shrek is missing. When the Fairy Godmother asks Harold to give Fiona the potion that will cause her to fall in love with Prince Charming, he refuses at first, disgusted at this invasion of her [[free will]], but he is forced to acquiesce by some dark threat of disclosure. In the event, when Fiona states that she loves the old Shrek, rather the new one that Prince Charming is pretending to be, Harold swaps the cup containing the potion for his own.\n\nAt the ball toward the end of the film, Harold saves Fiona and Shrek from a blast of magic from Fairy Godmother's wand, and it transforms him back into a frog, which is revealed to be his original form, before he married Queen Lillian. Afterwards, Harold apologizes to Shrek and warmly accepts him into the family, and as he decides to leave believing that he is not the man Lillian deserved, she comforts him by saying that he is more that man now than he ever was when he was a human.\n\nKing Harold makes a very brief final appearance as the frog king in ''Shrek the Third'', in which Shrek and Fiona fill in for him and Lillian during his illness, which later turns out to be terminal (The story book ''The Legend of Shrek'' and other publications state that the transition from human to frog confused his age and accelerated the aging process). He tells Shrek on his deathbed about Fiona's cousin Arthur is next in line to the throne of Far Far Away, when Shrek and Fiona both reject an ogre and ogress as king and a lady in-wating, is a bad idea given their inexperiences and disastrous attempts to fill in for him. Harold dies shortly after telling Shrek and Fiona, as he is never seen nor heard from again.\n\nKing Harold makes his cameo appearance in ''Shrek Forever After'', in which he appears very briefly in a couple of flashbacks only. In the first, he and Lillian are about to make a deal with Rumpelstiltskin, but they break it off at the last moment, after a royal messenger enters and informs them that Fiona has been saved. In the alternate reality of the second flashback, Harold and Lillian disappear after signing over the kingdom to Rumpelstiltskin. At the end of the film, the original timeline is restored, leaving the current time a year or so after Harold's death (as seen in ''Shrek the Third''). However, there is a large painting of him as a human in which the face moves, possibly indicating that his [[spirit]] inhabits the picture. Unlike the previous films, he is never seen in his frog form.\n\n==={{Anchor|Doris the Ugly Stepsister}}Doris===\n'''Doris''' (voiced by [[Larry King]] and [[Jonathan Ross]] in the UK version of [[Shrek 2]]) makes her first appearance in ''Shrek 2'' and returns in ''Shrek the Third'' and very briefly in ''Shrek Forever After''. She is based on one of [[Ugly sisters|Cinderella's two stepsisters]]. Unlike other ugly sisters, she is an ally and best friend to Fiona. She is first seen as an unusually masculine female [[bartender]] at the Poison Apple. She is depicted as a tall, independent woman with purple-themed clothes who wears Elizabeth Taylor style makeup. Her character design is intended to invoke the appearance of a [[drag queen]], which is supported with her masculine voice.\n\nDoris is first seen in ''Shrek 2'', when King Harold secretly enters the Poison Apple Club, in which she is working as a bartender. She recommends Puss In Boots to the king for the task of assassinating Shrek. Near the climax of the film, Doris directs King Harold to a door guarded by the Fairy Godmother's bodyguards, behind which Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother are secretly meeting. At first, she has a crush on Prince Charming and forces him to kiss her at the end of the film. In ''Far Far Away Idol'', she is accused by [[Simon Cowell]] of being ugly after she sings Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\".<ref>Susan Wloszczyna, \"[https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-10-06-shrek2-dvd_x.htm Here comes the judge: Simon's a 'Shrek' extra],\" ''USA Today'' (10/6/2004).</ref>\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', Doris becomes one of Shrek's friends before the events of the film. At the beginning of the film, Doris is briefly mentioned by Mabel when Prince Charming visits the Poison Apple. Mabel says that Doris does not belong here, and this indicates that Doris has reformed from villainy and sided with Shrek. She is also seen during Fiona's baby shower, but she escapes with the other princesses through a hidden trapdoor when Charming starts to enter the castle. Later, she is imprisoned by Charming after he invades Far Far Away. With the princesses, Donkey and Puss, she escapes and infiltrates the castle to confront Charming. In the end, Doris and Mabel finally meet in Charming's play and reconcile when Artie convinces the villains not to continue their villainous ways when they didn't get their happily ever after.\n\nDoris appears very briefly in ''Shrek Forever After'', working at The Happy Apple (formerly The Poison Apple) during the ogre triplets' birthday party.\n\n===Snow White===\n'''[[Snow White]]''' (voiced by [[Amy Poehler]], singing voice provided by [[Megan Hilty]]) is one of Princess Fiona's friends. She has a talent for singing, which she uses to charm animals and make them follow her orders. She is shown to be very proud and vain, even boasting how she won Fairest In The Land from the Wicked Queen.\n\nIn the first film, Snow White cameos as one of the fairytale creatures to be banished to Shrek's swamp. She is shown sleeping inside her coffin and being handled{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} by her seven dwarves. When Lord Farquaad is forced to choose a wife, Snow White, seen sleeping in the glass coffin, is his second choice. At Shrek and Fiona's wedding, she fights with Cinderella to catch Fiona's bouquet.\n\nIn ''Shrek 2'', Snow White is briefly mentioned when the Fairy Godmother is explaining to Shrek that ogres do not live happily ever after.\n\nSnow White appears more prominently in ''Shrek the Third'', dressed in red. She becomes friends with Princess Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, Cinderella and the Sleeping Beauty before the events of the film. Prince Charming interrupts Fiona's baby shower after she gives her a dwarf as a gift to babysit the triplets, saying that she has six more at home. She escapes with Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris and the other princesses. She is later betrayed by Rapunzel and imprisoned in a dungeon. She complains that they could just have stayed put and carried on with their normal routines (having tea parties and similarly stereotypical \"girly\" behavior), claiming to not care who is in charge. Later she is content just to wait to be rescued, as normal for fairytale princesses.\n\nFiona encourages her and the others to show some initiative, and they manage to escape and head towards the castle. She tricks the guards (talking trees) by singing a high tone (using the same voice as in the Disney film) to charm the animals, and screaming (the same scream as in \"[[The Immigrant Song]]\" by [[Led Zeppelin]]) to command them to attack the trees. Her plan works and they enter the castle grounds, avoiding the knights guarding it. Snow White, along with the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian, arrives just in time to stop Prince Charming from killing Shrek. After Charming is defeated, she is seen in the background, talking to the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian.\n\nAlthough it is unclear whether Snow White is married, at one point she is seen with a tattoo on her upper arm with the name Dopey surrounded by a heart.\n\n===Cinderella===\n'''[[Cinderella]]''' (voiced by [[Amy Sedaris]]) is one of Princess Fiona's friends. She wears her pair of glass slippers throughout the events of ''Shrek the Third''. She uses her glass slipper as a weapon, somewhat like a boomerang. She is obsessed with cleanliness and tidiness after doing a great deal of housework for her stepmother and stepsisters (revealed to be Doris and Mabel).\n\nIn the [[Shrek 2 (video game)|''Shrek 2'' video game]], however, she is portrayed as an absent-minded [[valley girl]].\n\nWhen [[Lord Farquaad]] is forced to choose his wife so that he can become king, Cinderella is one of his choices. She is shown at number 1 in a painting, wearing a yellow dress and trying on her glass slipper. However, Farquaad chooses Princess Fiona, ranked number 3. At Shrek and Fiona's wedding, Cinderella is shown fighting with Snow White to catch Fiona's bouquet.\n\nIn ''Shrek 2'', Cinderella is briefly mentioned while the Fairy Godmother is explaining to Shrek that ogres do not live happily ever after. There is also a picture of her in Fairy Godmother's factory. This can be seen more clearly in a behind-the-scenes guide. Thus Fairy Godmother appears to be the evil twin sister of Cinderella's fairy godmother.\n\nCinderella appears more prominently in ''Shrek the Third'', now wearing a light blue-silver dress. She becomes friends with Princess Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, Snow White and the Sleeping Beauty prior to the events of the film. She first appears in Fiona's baby shower, which Prince Charming interrupts when he takes over the throne. She escapes with Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, and the other princesses. She is later betrayed by Rapunzel and imprisoned with others in a dungeon. They escape and head towards the castle. After Snow White tricks the guards, they enter the castle's grounds and avoid the knights on guard. While trying to get into the castle, Cinderella hurls her glass slipper like a boomerang at a knight, knocking him out. Cinderella, with the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian, arrives just in time to stop Prince Charming from killing Shrek. After Charming is defeated, she is seen talking to the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian in the background.\n\n===Sleeping Beauty===\n'''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''' (voiced by [[Cheri Oteri]]) is one of Princess Fiona's friends. She likes to sleep a lot. Because she sleeps so much in the film, little is known about her personality, other than that she seems to be a pleasant person who is a little eccentric at times.\n\nIn ''Shrek 2'', Sleeping Beauty is shown in a poorly drawn picture in Fiona's diary, explaining that Sleeping Beauty is having a party with all the other princesses, but Princess Fiona is not allowed to go, on account of the ogreish appearance she acquires every night. Later in the film, Sleeping Beauty appears without speaking when a coach-limousine pulls up at the red carpet to the Far Far Away Royal Ball. When the door opens, she falls to the ground, still sleeping. In the film, she wears a blue dress and a crown.\n\nSleeping Beauty appears more prominently in ''Shrek the Third'', now wearing a white-green dress, and with light brown hair.  She becomes friends with Princess Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, Snow White and Cinderella before the events of the film. She first appears in Fiona's baby shower, but Prince Charming interrupts it and takes over the throne. She escapes with Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, and the other princesses. She is later betrayed by Rapunzel and imprisoned with others in a dungeon. They escape and head towards the castle.\n\nAfter Snow White tricks the guards, they enter the castle's grounds, avoiding the knights on guard. While trying to get into the castle, Sleeping Beauty yawns and falls to the ground, causing the knights to trip over her and fall. With the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian, Sleeping Beauty arrives just in time to stop Prince Charming from killing Shrek. After Charming is defeated, she is seen talking to the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian in the background.\n\n===Merlin===\n'''[[Merlin]]''' (voiced by [[Eric Idle]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/blshrekthethirdpicsv.htm|title=Eric Idle voices Merlin in DreamWorks' \"Shrek the Third,\" to be released by Paramount Pictures in May 2007.|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref>) is a retired [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] teacher from Artie's high school, Worcestershire, in ''Shrek the Third''.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', after their ship crashes into sharp rocks, Shrek, Donkey, Puss and Artie get stranded on an island (possibly Lovers' Beach in Far Far Away). They meet Arthur's retired teacher Merlin, after Artie tries to separate himself from Shrek. Since Merlin retired because of a nervous breakdown (which he calls \"third-level fatigue\"), he seems rather eccentric, and his magic spells usually go wrong. At one point, when he prepares to teleport Shrek, Donkey, Puss and Artie to Far Far Away, he cracks his knuckles, only to fire a bolt that destroys a boulder.\n\nIn order to help Shrek and Arthur be reconciled, he makes them look into a thick cloud of smoke to reveal their thoughts. Shrek sees a baby carriage, but lies and says that he sees a \"rainbow pony\". Merlin is pleased and moves on to Arthur, who sees a bird and its father. The father bird abandons the chick, leaving it frightened and confused. Merlin is happy they decided to look into their soul, and as he retreats to his hut, Shrek takes the opportunity to show Arthur that they are not so different after all. They catch Merlin eavesdropping on their conversation when he plays the song \"That's What Friends Are For\" on a phonograph to add to the mood.\n\nWhen Captain Hook and his cronies ambush Shrek, Donkey, Puss and Artie, he plays his piano, and Merlin is beside him playing it too until he is pushed away. After the villains retreat, Artie convinces Merlin to use a spell to teleport them to Far Far Away. But the spell causes Donkey and Puss to switch bodies (probably because they took each other's \"hands\" seconds before). After Prince Charming's defeat, Merlin returns, and Puss and Donkey force him to put them back in their own bodies. The spell works, but causes their tails to switch. Merlin tries to tell them, but decides not to, though their tails have inexplicably returned to normal later.\n\nIn the first movie, he cameos as one of the fairy tale creatures banished to Shrek's swamp. He appears standing with the Big Bad Wolf and when Shrek asks if anyone knows Farquaad, they both point at each other. In the [[Shrek (video game)|video game]] to the first Shrek film, a different version of Merlin kidnaps Fiona.\n\n===Brogan===\n'''Brogan''' (voiced by [[Jon Hamm]]) is an [[ogre]] and the second-in-command of the Ogre Resistance in ''Shrek Forever After''. He uses his nose as their horn to communicate music. He's got really short, almost invisible, ginger hair and unshaven face. He's nice, kind and loyal. He is taller, bigger, more muscular and much more handsome than Shrek. He's possibly the strongest one of all ogres, because when the witches carry up all of the ogres with their Skull Chains, Brogan is too strong and he pulls the Skull Chains that are attached to him, so the Witches fall from their broomsticks.\n\nBrogan introduces Shrek into the resistance and is seen in the meeting with Fiona on how to fight against Rumpelstiltskin and the witches. When Pied Piper arrives and uses his flute, the song \"Shake Your Groove Thing\" is played, and Brogan cannot stop dancing. Later, he and the other ogres are captured, but they fight in the castle and defeat Rumpelstiltskin. He is also seen at the party in the end of the film.\n\nIn the audio commentary for the DVD release, Mike Mitchell states Brogan was originally meant to be Prince Charming, Fiona's love interest with the same curse as her, called \"Gnimrahc\", which is Charming spelled backwards.\n\n===Cookie===\n'''Cookie''' (voiced by [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) is an [[ogre]] and a [[chef]] for the Ogre Resistance in ''Shrek Forever After''. Although at first seeming to be male in appearance, Cookie identifies as a woman. Food is her only weapon against the witches and Rumpelstiltskin. Her signature dish is the [[chimichanga]], of which she takes a cartful to the ambush of Rumplestiltskin. Cookie is very recognizable due to the garlic she has tied into her goatee and a chef hat. She is a very outgoing and friendly ogre. She is the only ogre to enjoy dancing while Pied Piper plays his flute until she and the others are captured. She catapults her chimichangas at the witches during the final battle. She is also seen at the party in the end of the film.\n\n===Gretched===\n'''Gretched''' (voiced by [[Jane Lynch]]) is a female [[ogre]] who appears in the ''[[Shrek Forever After]]''. She is a member of the Ogre Resistance. She is one of the strong soldiers and she plays an important role in the Ogre Resistance. She is more of a stereotypical ogre as opposed to kind and delicate like Fiona, looking and behaving closer to like that of the other male ogres. She is also seen at the party in the end of the film.\n\n===Humpty Dumpty===\n'''[[Humpty Dumpty|Humpty Alexander Dumpty]]''' (voiced by [[Zach Galifianakis]]), in his childhood, was best friends with Puss and tried to find magic beans with him. However, their quest failed and Puss later became a revered hero in their hometown. Humpty grew jealous of Puss's fame and later tricked him into helping him rob a bank, thus branding Puss an outlaw. They were pursued by the authorities; Humpty was captured while Puss escaped. Seven years later, Humpty along with Kitty Softpaws convinced Puss to help him get magic beans from Jack and Jill to get the Golden Goose, but it was revealed that this was all a plot to just get Puss back home and arrested as revenge for abandoning him. But later Humpty had a change of heart and helped Puss and Kitty tame The Great Terror. In the end, he sacrifices himself to save San Ricardo and falls from the bridge, upon which his shell is broken, revealing him to be a golden egg.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek Super Slam]]'', he is known as Master Fu and is an unlockable character. In ''[[Shrek 4-D]]'', his grave can be seen in the cemetery.\n\nPuss In Boots mentions him in ''[[Puss in Boots: The Three Diablos]]''.\n\n===Kitty Softpaws===\nKitty (voiced by [[Salma Hayek]]) is a black [[tuxedo cat]]. She has a white chest, whiskers, muzzle, tail-tip, eyebrows and white paws. Her eyes are bright blue. She wears a brown belt in which she carries a long dagger, along with dark brown boots. Her fur is very thick. Her paws do not have claws because they were removed by her former owners, but this lends to her skill as an exceptional thief. She pretends to be Puss's friend, but it is revealed later that she was in cahoots with Humpty and Jack and Jill to steal the Golden Goose and trick Puss into being imprisoned in his home town. During their adventures, she falls in love with Puss, and eventually she saves him and helps him bring the Golden Goose back to the Great Terror. At the end of the movie, they are dancing flamenco and their dance leads to a passionate kiss, though it is revealed that they went their separate ways sometime after.\n\n==Main villains==\n\n===Lord Farquaad===\n{{Main|Lord Farquaad}}\n'''Lord Farquaad''' (voiced by [[John Lithgow]]) [[Andre Sogliuzzo]] in Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing is the narcissistic, ruthless and diminutive ruler of the huge castle of Duloc.\n\nIn his pursuit of perfection, Farquaad attempts to rid his domain of fairy tale creatures, offering a bounty for their capture and then exiling them to Shrek's swamp. Farquaad wants to become a king, but because he is not of royal blood, he cannot until he marries a princess. He decides that Princess Fiona will be his perfect wife and queen, but first she must be rescued from her tower, which is guarded by a fire-breathing dragon.\n\nUnwilling to perform the rescue himself, Farquaad holds a tournament to select the knight that will rescue Princess Fiona. But Shrek and Donkey turn up and defeat the knights, so Farquaad decides to send Shrek on the quest instead, agreeing to remove the fairytale creatures from his swamp if he rescues Fiona. Shrek delivers Fiona to Farquaad, who immediately proposes marriage, unaware that she becomes an ogress at sunset. Shrek disrupts the marriage ceremony, delaying a kiss between Farquaad and Fiona until after sunset.\n\nFiona makes the transition from human to ogre form, upon which Farquaad rejects his new bride, banishing her back to the tower, still claiming the title of king and sentencing Shrek to death. However, before Farquaad finishes his claims to the kingdom, Shrek whistles to summon Dragon, who has since developed a relationship with Donkey, and she crashes through the window and devours the monologuing Farquaad. Moments later, Dragon burps and the crown comes out of her mouth. Although he seemed to be feared and respected, Farquaad was apparently not well liked in Duloc, as when Dragon eats him, the citizens laugh and cheer.\n\nHe is confirmed to be dead when he enters as a ghost in the ''Shrek 4-D'' ride at Universal Studios and the 30-minute Shrek Special on the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon TV channel]], in which he tries to murder Shrek and Donkey and to kidnap and kill Fiona so that she can be his queen in the afterlife. Princess Fiona is again rescued when Lord Farquaad is presumably killed by Dragon a second time. In ''[[Scared Shrekless]]'', Farquaad is long dead, and his castle left in a decrepit state.\n\nLord Farquaad does not appear, nor is he mentioned in ''[[Shrek 2]]'', but he briefly appears in Gingy's flashbacks in ''[[Shrek the Third]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'', it is revealed that Lord Farquaad's mother was the princess from the fairy tale ''[[The Princess and the Pea]]''. Also, Lord Farquaad's father was Grumpy of the [[Seven Dwarfs]]. Farquaad claimed earlier that Grumpy abandoned him in the woods as a child, but Grumpy reveals the true reason he kicked Farquaad out is that he was 28 years old and wouldn't move out of his basement as revealed when he and the other fairy tale characters raid Lord Farquaad's wedding.\n\n===Fairy Godmother===\nThe '''[[Fairy godmother|Fairy Godmother]]''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Saunders]]) and by [[Claudia Christian]] in the videogames and by [[Pinky Turzo]] in Thriller Night, is a scheming, conniving [[wikt:opportunist|opportunist]], loosely based on the fairy-tale [[Cinderella]]'s \"[[Fairy Godmother]].\" She seeks to get the best for herself and her son [[#Prince Charming|Prince Charming]], rather than others. She takes an instant dislike to Shrek, and when he tries to ask her why Fiona is not happy, she rudely points out that \"ogres don't live happily ever after.\" She then briefly insults Shrek, calling his fingers \"dirty green sausages.\" She often resorts to blackmail and trickery through magic to get her way. She is a [[Emotional eating|stress eater]] (\"someone get me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate,\" when Shrek makes a mess of her potion factory, and during her talk with Harold in the carriage about Shrek, it is shown that Harold ruined her diet when she orders food from Friar's Fat Boy). It is a popular theory that she placed the spell on Fiona that makes her turn into an ogre at night as part of her plan to get Charming to marry her.\n\nBubbles are her character's main theme. In her first appearance, she is surrounded by bubbles as she sings to Fiona. When Shrek uses her card to ask for help, a voice mail message of her appears with her saying \"Is it on? Is it on?\" she is again surrounded by a bubble, which then shows an image of the Fairy Godmother's cottage. After the message ends, the bubble bursts. Finally when the Fairy Godmother dies, in an attempt to cast a spell to kill Shrek which is deflected onto her by King Harold's armor, she bursts into a host of bubbles. Her death later influences Charming to get revenge by taking over Far Far Away.\n\nAlthough The Fairy Godmother does not appear in ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', she is mentioned numerously by Prince Charming.\n\nThe Fairy Godmother is briefly mentioned by Lillian and Harold in the opening scene of ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' and makes a cameo during the end credits.\n\n===Prince Charming===\n'''[[Prince Charming]]''' (voiced by [[Rupert Everett]] in the second and third movie, [[Sean Bishop]] in ''Scared Shrekless'', James Arnold Taylor in videogames) is the son of the Fairy Godmother. He is very handsome, and was supposed to rescue Princess Fiona from her dragon-guarded tower.\n\nIn his first scene in ''Shrek 2'', he travels to the castle where Fiona had been imprisoned prior to the first film, only to discover that Shrek has already found and married her, and that the [[Big Bad Wolf (Shrek)|Big Bad Wolf]] has taken to sleeping in her tower.\n\nIt is later revealed that Charming is the son of the Fairy Godmother and that she wants him to marry Fiona so that he can become king. In contrast to his fairytale namesake, Prince Charming is characterized as an arrogant, vain and spoiled mama's boy, and she as his doting parent, as well as shallow about his appearance. He later deceives Fiona into believing that he is Shrek, having been turned human by a \"Happily Ever After\" potion. His heartless attitude shows through the disguise and Fiona realizes the truth, knocking him unconscious with a headbutt. At the end of the film, he is forcefully kissed by the ugly stepsister, Doris.\n\nHe sings \"[[I'm Too Sexy]]\" by \"[[Right Said Fred]]\" in ''Far Far Away Idol'', but because of his horrible singing, Fiona presses a button that opens a trap door below him and he falls into it. He is voiced here by Randy Crenshaw.<ref name=btva>[http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Shrek/Prince-Charming/ Behind the Actors: Prince Charming] Behind the Voice Actors, Retrieved April 16, 2016</ref>\n\nAs the main antagonist of ''Shrek the Third'', Charming gathers all the evil characters from fairy tales that were at the Poison Apple Bar to get their revenge and their \"Happily Ever Afters\". After they invade the main castle of Far Far Away, Charming prepares a stage show in which he will kill Shrek in front of the entire kingdom. Shrek takes part in the show, but his allies come to the rescue.\n\nArthur Pendragon then convinces the fairytale villains to give up their evil ways. Charming is furious and attacks Artie only to be stopped by Shrek, who throws him towards a prop tower made of stone. Dragon purposely knocks the tower over and it lands on Charming, crushing him to death.\n\nHe appears in ''[[Scared Shrekless]]'', in the story \"Boots Motel\" (made up by Donkey and Puss). This time, he is voiced by Sean Bishop.<ref name=\"btva\" />\n\nHe appears as a zombie and at the movie theater in Shrek's nightmare, in ''Thriller Night'', a ''Shrek'' parody of the short film ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's Thriller]]''.\n\nRupert Everett's name appears in the cast list for ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', but Prince Charming has only a non-speaking cameo in the film, during the end credits. It's unknown why he didn't rescue Fiona in the alternate timeline, although it could be because she lost the throne of Far Far Away after her parents signed away their kingdom to Rumpelstiltskin and he knew he wouldn't gain anything by marrying her.\n\n===Rumpelstiltskin===\n'''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]''' (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]] in Shrek the Third, [[Walt Dohrn]] in subsequent media) is an evil short con man who makes magical deals (complete with contracts), but give them a horrible twist in fate for their lives. He has a giant pet [[goose]] named Fifi.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', a different version of Rumpelstiltskin decides to join Prince Charming as an attempt for the other villains to get their happily ever after. And as with the other villains, this Rumpelstiltskin decided to quit being a villain.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', the story begins during the time frame of the first Shrek movie. King Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign their kingdom over to Rumpelstiltskin to break Fiona's curse, as Lilian believes that the Fairy Godmother cannot be trusted, though Harold is reluctant to trust Rumpelstiltskin. At the last moment, they learn that Fiona has been rescued from the tower and do not sign the contract. Rumpelstiltskin is then furious and vows revenge on Shrek.\n\nThe setting then moves forward to after ''Shrek the Third''. Seeing Shrek missing his old life as a free and terrifying ogre, Rumpelstiltskin makes a deal with him, tricking him into giving up the day he was born. This deal enables Rumpelstiltskin to be the ruler of Far Far Away by creating an alternate reality in which Shrek never existed and therefore never rescued Fiona, thus causing the king and queen to sign the contract which gave him their kingdom. Shrek tries to reverse the deal by using the exit clause - a true love's kiss - before 24 hours elapse and he disappears forever. Though this is proved difficult because in this reality, Fiona is a leader of a band of rebel ogres and takes an immediate dislike to Shrek, whom she does not know. Rumpelstiltskin has an army of witches to stop him and hires the Pied Piper to capture him and the other ogres. He succeeds in capturing all but Shrek and Fiona. When he offers anything in return for the one who brings Shrek to him, Shrek turns himself in, and in exchange has Rumpelstiltskin set the ogres free (though he keeps Fiona, as she is a human by day and therefore not completely an ogre). Rumpelstiltskin looses Dragon on Shrek and Fiona (who is still feral in this reality), but Puss, Donkey and the other ogres come to fight, and with Shrek and Fiona they defeat Rumpelstiltskin and his army of witches. By this time Shrek's 24 hours are almost up, but at the last second, Fiona kisses the fading Shrek, whom she now realizes that she loves, thus restoring the original reality. Rumpelstiltskin is last seen during the ending, imprisoned in a cage by Shrek, Fiona and the other ogres, while Fifi explodes at Fiona's high-note singing, Rumpelstilskin is also tormented by the Pied Piper who makes him dance in his cage.\n\nIn ''Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular'', Rumpelstiltskin is still imprisoned in a cage and receives coal for Christmas. He appears twice in ''Shrek's Yule Log'', out of his cage and unsuccessfully trying to put out the fireplace.\n\nRumplestiltskin combines features of the previous three main villains: he is short and rules an empire with an iron fist, like Farquaad; he has magical powers to help others alter their fates, like the Fairy Godmother; and his life is ruined by Shrek's rescue of Fiona from the castle keep, like Prince Charming. It is ultimately implied by Donkey, when he is folding Shrek's contract into origami, that the original way to break Rumpelstilskin's contract was to say his name, which no longer works because by this point in time everyone already knows who he is.\n\n===Jack and Jill===\n'''[[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack and Jill]]''' (voiced by [[Billy Bob Thornton]] and [[Amy Sedaris]]) are a married couple.\n\nIn ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]'', Jack and Jill are in the possession of the magic beans from the [[Jack and the Beanstalk]] story, which Puss, Kitty Softpaws and Humpty Dumpty manage to steal to get into the giant's keep. However, it is revealed later that Jack and Jill were in cahoots with Humpty and Kitty to take the Golden Goose and trick Puss into being imprisoned in his home town. But when the Great Terror arrives to retrieve Golden Goose, its baby, Jack and Jill try to steal the Goose when Humpty had a change of heart and tried to help Puss lure the Great Terror away from San Ricardo, only for the couple to be stomped on by the Terror. During the credits, Jack and Jill are seen in full body casts.\n\nThroughout the film, Jack tries convincing Jill that they should start a family, but after Jill's persistent refusal of having a baby, he happily compromises with Jill in assuming the role of taking care of their piglets, both especially showing a particular fondness for one piglet named \"Hamhock\".\n\nIn ''[[Shrek 2]]'', a thinner Jill is one of three women shown ogling a newly human Shrek, mentioning Jack as having gone to fetch a pail of water, not recognising Puss in Boots.\n\n==Minor villains==\n\n===Thelonious===\n'''Thelonious''' (voiced by [[Christopher Knights]]) appears as one of Lord Farquaad's henchmen and possibly the executioner, as he's the one who tortures Gingy by breaking his legs and melting him in the milk and threatens the Magic Mirror by suggesting Lord Farquaad to break it. His face is always covered by the hood, but he also wears really tight costume that emphasizes the size of his muscles and crotch. He has poor intelligence, as shown when Lord Farquaad is deciding between three princesses and Thelonious says \"Three! Pick number three, my lord\" while holding up two fingers. He's later seen at Fiona and Farquaad's wedding and it is possible that he isn't really a villain, because when they kiss, he wrote \"Aawww\" on one of the signs that are telling people how should they react to different situations. He's also seen in the ending, at Shrek and Fiona's wedding, when he helps to play the music organ. He also makes a cameo appearance in ''Shrek Forever After'', but only during the credits (showing a slide show of clips from the last 3 ''Shrek'' films).\n\nHe also appears in [[Shrek 4-D]], where he kidnaps Fiona so the spirit of Farquaad can kill her and make her his spirit queen. But when Thelonious released the raft to send Fiona over a waterfall, he forgot to get off of it first. He accepted Fiona punching his face multiple times. When she finds her punches doesn't hurt him, she kicks Thelonious hard between his legs by stepping on the wooden beam of the raft. After he  collapsed in pain and fell overboard, she apologized to him. Then he fell from the waterfall but grabbed onto a branch. When Fiona, Shrek and Donkey fell from the waterfall as well, he proved he is good, because he caught them all in one hand while still held the branch by the othe until the branch broke. They all fell down the waterfall, but the Dragon rescued all of them and kills Lord Farquaad for good. Thelonious becomes the first ''Shrek'' films villain to change to good.\n\n===Rapunzel===\n'''[[Rapunzel]]''' (voiced by [[Maya Rudolph]]) is one of Princess Fiona's former friends. She is snobbish, opinionated, vain, and does not seem to get along with the bossy Snow White.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', Rapunzel is first seen during Fiona's baby shower, until Prince Charming invades the castle and the princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian escape secretly. Rapunzel pretends to find an exit and runs all the way to where Charming really is. The princesses, Doris and Lillian follow but are cornered by Charming's knights. Rapunzel then betrays them and shows off her love and affection for the Prince, while the other women are imprisoned in a dungeon with Rapunzel telling Prince Charming not to have any harm come to them. While they are there, Rapunzel practices for her role in Prince Charming's play. In the final performance, she sings and acts as a princess on top of a tower (mimicking Princess Fiona, whose situation itself mimics Rapunzel's). The play is interrupted by Shrek's friends and Fiona. Gingy comes on stage by holding on to Rapunzel's hair, which he accidentally pulls off. When it is revealed that she is actually bald, Rapunzel gasps in horror and runs from the stage out of embarrassment.\n\n===Captain Hook===\n'''[[Captain Hook]]''' (voiced by [[Ian McShane]] in the third movie) appears in ''Shrek 2'' in the bar of the Poison Apple, where he plays the piano and sings \"Little Drop of Poison\" (his singing voice during that song was provided by [[Tom Waits]]) and \"People Just Ain't No Good\" (his singing voice during that song was provided by [[Nick Cave]]) in the other. He appears in ''Shrek the Third'', working for Prince Charming. When Artie convinces the villains to give up evil, Hook states that he grows daffodils and they are beautiful. Captain Hook is the first who throws his weapon down and becomes good.\n\nCaptain Hook also appears as a contestant in the ''Far Far Away Idol'' feature on the ''Shrek 2'' DVD with his singing voice provided by [[Matt Mahaffey]]. He begins to sing \"[[Hooked On A Feeling]]\" until Tinkerbell (whom Hook poisons in the classic Peter Pan story) prompts [[Simon Cowell]] to remove him from the stage.\n\nCaptain Hook does not appear in ''Shrek Forever After'', but his voice is heard in the soundtrack, and he makes a cameo in the book opening of the film holding some daffodils.\n\n===Cyclops===\nThe '''[[Cyclops]]''' (voiced by [[Mark Valley]]) is the [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] for the Poison Apple as seen in ''[[Shrek 2]]''.\n\nHe appears in ''[[Shrek Super Slam]]'', and his slam is \"Eye in the Sky\".\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', the Cyclops is seen on a Bucking Bronco at the Poison Apple Bar when Prince Charming comes in. The Cyclops is among the villains that help Prince Charming take over Far Far Away. He has a daughter, a cute little cyclops girl who also has only one eye who he brings with him as part of \"Take Your Daughter to Work Day.\" He is a family man and does not really want to be evil. He even apologizes to Shrek when he hits him too hard. His idea of \"pillaging\" during the attack on Far, Far Away isn't exactly the most evil either, as he is only seen ripping the stamps off the letters in a mailbox.\n\nVarious Cyclopes like him appear in the ''Shrek the Third'' video game, but it is unknown if he is there or not.\n\n===Mabel the Ugly Stepsister===\n'''Mabel''' (voiced by [[Regis Philbin]]) is the sister of Doris and the [[Ugly sisters|stepsister of Cinderella]]. She first appears in ''Shrek the Third'', where she assists Prince Charming in his plan to take over Far Far Away. She is chubby and wears green-themed clothes. Like Doris, she is a kind-hearted person.\n\nMabel is first seen when, at the bar of the Poison Apple, Prince Charming asks her where Doris is. Mabel, who has taken Doris's place as [[bartender]], replies \"She's not welcome here.\" (In fact, Doris is now friends with Shrek and Princess Fiona). Like Doris, Mabel has a crush on Prince Charming. At the film's climax, she meets Doris on stage after the tower prop falls on Prince Charming and they reconcile.\n\nMabel appears two times in ''Shrek Forever After'', first time at the ogre triplets' birthday party where she tells Shrek that he forgot the candles for the birthday cake and second time where she grew old as one of the viewers of Rumpelstiltskin's message in the alternate reality.\n\n===The Evil Gnomes===\nThe '''Evil [[Gnome]]''' are gnomes who wear dark clothes and sport black beards. They appeared briefly in the second film and more prominent in the third.\n\nIn ''Shrek 2'', two Evil Gnomes are shown wrestling with each other.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', the Evil Gnomes help Prince Charming in his plot to take over Far Far Away.\n\n===The Evil Trees===\nThe '''Evil Trees''' are a group of mobile wicked trees. Appearing briefly in the second film and more prominently in the third. In ''Shrek 2'' the two Evil Trees has been seen doing \"[[Arm wrestling|branch wrestling]]\" while one breaks the branch of the other. In ''Shrek the Third'' the two '''Evil [[Tree]]s''' (played by Andrew Birch and [[Christopher Knights]]) help Prince Charming in his plot to take over Far Far Away. In one scene of the third film, their names are revealed to be Ed and Steve. In the same scene, they explain that it is hard to find work since most of the world is against them. The other Evil Trees are dropped into Far Far Away during the Evil Witches' air raid.\n\nThe trees are possibly two of the living trees from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.\n\nThe evil trees appear in the ''[[Shrek Forever After (video game)|Shrek Forever After]]'' video game.\n\n===The Evil Queen===\nThe '''[[Queen (Snow White)|Evil Queen]]''' (voiced by [[Susanne Blakeslee|Susan Blakeslee]]) appears in the third Shrek film where she assists Prince Charming in taking over Far Far Away when Prince Charming visits the Poison Apple bar. Prince Charming refers to her as the \"Wicked Witch.\" When she is about to kill Queen Lillian (with a sword to her neck), Artie asserts they all can all stop being evil if they are willing to make a better choice. The Evil Queen happily says that she always wants to open a spa in France.\n\n===The Puppet Master===\n'''The Puppet Master''' (voiced by [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]]) appears in ''Shrek the Third'' where Prince Charming convinces him to join his brigade by describing how Pinocchio has gone to look for his \"real\" father and never writes. His only line is \"I hate that little wooden puppet\".\n\nHe is loosely based on [[Mangiafuoco]] in the [[Carlo Collodi]]'s book ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' and more based on Stromboli in the [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Disney film]] (bearing that name in the video game).\n\n===Headless Horseman===\n'''[[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|Headless Horseman]]''' (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]]) makes a cameo appearance in the Poisoned Apple during the second film and appears in the third film with Prince Charming in his invasion of villains. He seems to be a good friend of Captain Hook. He reveals that he has \"always wanted to play the flute\" (which would be difficult at best since he has no head).\n\n===Fifi===\n'''Fifi''' is Rumpelstiltskin's giant pet [[goose]]. He is also his bodyguard and carriage puller and attacks Shrek and Donkey at one point. During the ending credits, Fiona sings a high note, causing Fifi to explode alongside the bluebird, a homage to a scene from the first movie.\n\nFifi does not appear in ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]'', but The Great Terror looks a lot like him.\n\n===Witches===\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', some '''[[Witchcraft|Witches]]''' are shown as patrons at the bar of the Poison Apple (one of them was seen singing at the Poison Apple Bar) when Prince Charming rallies the fairytale villains to take over Far Far Away. The witches carry out an air raid, dropping the evil trees from there to attack the citizens.\n\nSome witches are among Rumpelstiltskin's main assistants in ''Shrek Forever After'', wearing black coats and having long noses and greenish faces. They ride their broomsticks and use pumpkins as bombs. They can be killed by water, as Rumpelstiltskin does to one of them, who cries \"Oh, what a world! What a world!\", like the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Some of them are seen dancing modern hip hop moves to the Pied Piper's flute after they ridicule him. They are defeated in the final battle. Although most of them display vicious behavior for most of the film, they passively surrender once Rumpelstiltskin is captured and are even shown to be sorry for Fiona when Shrek disappears. Near the end, they have reformed and made a [[rainbow]] out of clouds. Baba and Griselda are the only witches whose names are mentioned.\n\nThe witches in ''Shrek Forever After'' are voiced by [[Billie Hayes]], [[Kristen Schaal]], [[Mary Kay Place]], [[Meredith Vieira]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Mike Mitchell (director)|Mike Mitchell]] and [[Lake Bell]].\n\n===Monsieur Robin Hood===\n'''\"Monsieur [[Robin Hood]]\"''' (voiced by [[Vincent Cassel]]) is a French-accented version of [[Robin Hood]] who appears in the first Shrek film. Believing that Shrek had kidnapped Princess Fiona, he and his Merry Men burst upon them and introduce themselves with an [[accordion]]-backed song and dance number describing how he intends to save Fiona and slay Shrek. She finds his song very \"annoying\" and cuts him off by knocking him to the ground, then defeats his entire band with her kung-fu skills, greatly impressing Shrek. Robin is portrayed as more of a confused nuisance than a threatening villain, as he genuinely believed that Shrek was going to harm Fiona. He and the Merry Men attend Shrek and Fiona's wedding, indicating that there was no real malice.\n\nRobin Hood and his Merry Men appear in ''[[Shrek SuperSlam|Shrek Super Slam]]'' as unlockable characters. They also appear in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party in the end of the film, joining with Shrek, Princess Fiona, Donkey, Snow White, Pinocchio, Thelonious, Papa Bear, Cinderella, the Big Bad Wolf, and others for a huge dance (they sing \"[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|Y.M.C.A.]]\").\n\n===Sir Lancelot===\n'''Sir [[Lancelot]]''' (voiced by [[John Krasinski]]) is one of Arthur's classmates in high school. The captain of the school's [[jousting]] team. He's got thick black hair and square jaw. He's very handsome, well-built and sexy, but also really rude, arrogant and narcissistic. He is the quintessential Big Man on Campus and a typical jock \u2014 he loves sport, he has got many fans and he tends to abuse his popularity. Lancelot is portrayed as more of a bully than a threatening villain. He takes every opportunity to assert his superiority over his classmates, whether through a sarcastic comeback or a beating on the jousting field. The main recipient of such thrashings is Artie, because Lancelot is much more muscular, handsome and stronger than him. He wins with him during jousting, so Shrek mistakes him for Artie, which doesn't look like a king. He is possibly Guinevere's boyfriend.\n\n===The Black Knight===\nThe [[gibberish]]-speaking '''[[Black knight|Black Knight]]''' (voiced by [[Max Koch]]) appears in black armor and a red cape in ''[[Shrek SuperSlam|Shrek Super Slam]]''. He is available as a standard character and his slam is the \"Seismic Smash\".\n\nIn \"Shrek the Third,\" there were some black knights that helped Prince Charming in a plot to kill Shrek\n\n===The Pied Piper===\nThe '''[[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]]''' appears briefly in the first film, among the fairy tale creatures exiled in Shrek's swamp, where he rallies many rats with his enchanted flute.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', he is hired by [[#Rumpelstiltskin|Rumpelstiltskin]] to capture the ogres by forcing them to dance and follow him with his enchanted flute. He can handle different species (rats, ogres, witches...) or even objects (Rumpelstiltskin's socks) by setting the \"target\" dial of his flute. He never speaks, only using his flute to communicate. The Piper has no real voice, but the flute performance was done by [[Jeremy Steig]] (original author [[William Steig]]'s son).\n\nIn ''Shrek Forever After'' he is seen playing two pop culture songs: at first he plays [[Sure Shot]], to make the witches dance after their mockery of him, and later he plays [[Shake Your Groove Thing]], in order to make the ogres dance directly to Rumpelstiltskin's castle\n\n===Raoul===\n'''Raoul''' (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]]) appears in ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]''. He is a hairy thief and thug. He has got some tattoos: three beans on his arm, beanstalk reaching the castle in the sky on his chest, golden goose on his back and golden eggs probably on his genitals (when he offered Puss to show that tattoo, he unzipped his trousers).\n\nHe is firstly seen in the bar where he is drinking and laughing at the cat along with the other thieves. He tells Puss the story about the Golden Goose and Jack and Jill and illustrates his tale by taking off his shirt and revealing his tattoos. He also tries to rob him, but then Puss cuts off half of his beard.\n\nLater, we can see that he was in cahoots with Humpty to take the Golden Goose and trick Puss into being imprisoned in his home town. After the Giant Terror went down to take the Golden Goose back, he is bathing and playing the rubber duck. The tattoos on his body makes the Giant Terror angry and she throws the bathtub where he was bathing into the air. It is unknown did he died or survived.\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===Magic Mirror===\nThe '''[[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]]''' (voiced by [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]]) is a mirror with a live spirit communicating through it, and with magical displaying abilities.\n\nIt is first brought to [[#Lord Farquaad|Lord Farquaad]] who asks it if Duloc is not the most perfect kingdom, exactly the same way the Evil Queen used to ask it if she was not the fairest of all. The magic mirror explains that Lord Farquaad is not from a royal family so he cannot be king unless he marries a princess. It then presents Lord Farquaad with three princesses that he can marry: Cinderella, Snow White, and Princess Fiona, in which he chooses Fiona. However, the mirror also tries to warn Farquaad about Fiona's curse, but is ignored. Farquaad later uses it to constantly review the image of Fiona, in which it is now constantly worried.\n\nIt is later seen to be with Shrek's posse, who in ''[[Shrek 2]]'' use it as a [[television set]] such as announcing that the show will be back after commercials.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', [[#Rumpelstiltskin|Rumpelstiltskin]] has it and uses it on television broadcasting purposes. In the ending, he is seen shining a light on a giant disco ball.\n\n===The Muffin Man===\n'''[[The Muffin Man|Jero the Muffin Man]]''' (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]]) is a [[baker]] who lives in Far Far Away.\n\nHe is mentioned briefly in the first ''Shrek'' film when Gingy and Lord Farquaad discuss their knowledge of him, speaking in the words of the nursery rhyme.\n\n{{anchor|Mongo}} He first appears in ''Shrek 2'', when Shrek and Gingy persuade him to bake an enormous gingerbread man named Mongo. Mongo helps the heroes to storm King Harold's castle during the Wedding Ball.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', the Muffin Man is revealed to be a father figure to Gingy, who calls him \"Papa\". As in the nursery rhyme, he lives on Drury Lane.\n\nHe appears in ''Shrek Forever After'' as a baker on birthday party. In the reality in which Shrek wasn't born, Gingy is seen fighting Animal Crackers and the Muffin Man is seen as a [[Bookmaker|bookie]] saying \"Place your bets!\" He also appears in the scene when Rumplestiltskin promises anyone's heart's desire if they give him Shrek.\n\n===Furniture===\nThe '''Furniture''' that are in Fiona's bedroom first appeared in ''Shrek 2''. They are brought to life by Fairy Godmother's magic to sing and dance with her and provide Fiona with the needs of being a princess but to Fairy Godmother and their surprise, she didn't need the requirements and are more shocked to learn that she's married to an ogre named Shrek. Later, they temporally come back to life and (under Fairy Godmother's orders) block the exits to prevent Shrek from escaping Fiona's room. Afterwards, they no longer speak or move.\n\nThey return in ''Shrek 3'', but are no longer alive (presumably due to Fairy Godmother's death); however, they still play a specific role in the film.\n\n===Guinevere===\n'''[[Guinevere]]''' (voiced by [[Latifa Ouaou]]) is a love interest of Arthur's. When he reveals this, she replies with \"ew\". She's possibly Lancelot's girlfriend. She chews bubble gum.\n\n===Imelda===\n'''Imelda''' (voiced by [[Constance Marie]]) was Puss' surrogate mother who appears in ''Puss in  Boots''.\n\n===Golden Goose===\nThe '''[[Golden Goose]]''' in ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]'' looks more like a giant gosling even being titled as the golden goose and even when she's too young, she lays solid [[The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs|golden eggs]] and is determined to fly as she flaps her wings.\n\n===Great Terror===\nEven being called so, the '''Great Terror''' is a giant [[Chen (genus)|white goose]] with golden wing [[feather]]s. She is also the mother of the Golden Goose who used to be owned by Giants.\n\nShe is very similar to Fifi from ''[[Shrek Forever After]]''.\n\n===Suzie===\n'''Suzie''' (voiced by [[Susan Fitzer]]) was a gingerbread girl and Gingy's girlfriend that appears briefly in Gingy's flashbacks in the third film and also in Gingy's flashback story in ''[[Shrek the Halls]]''. In ''Shrek the Third'', she has been seen kissing with Gingy in a car at a [[Drive-in theater|drive-in cinema]]. In ''Shrek the Halls'' in Gingy's Christmas story, he recounts a Christmas winter night he spent with her. The two were in a car made of bread and candies parked on a table, which made them seem like cookies left out for Santa Claus, who later tries to eat them. The gingerbread couple attempted to run, but Suzy was caught by Santa, and she was eaten after letting out a scream. Her death was shown to be the cause of Gingy's fear of Santa.\n\n===Sugar===\n'''Sugar''' (voiced by [[Kristen Schaal]]) is a gingerbread girl made up as Gingy's love interest in Gingy's (fictional) story \"The Bride of Gingy.\" in ''[[Scared Shrekless]]''. She became Gingy's girlfriend when Gingy explains to the Muffin Man that his other girlfriend kicked him out because he only cared about himself. To that, he makes Gingy a new girlfriend. Gingy thought of adding lots of sugar to the gingerbread batter to make his girlfriend really sweet, despite the Muffin Man's objections. Once Sugar is born, she falls in love with Gingy. At first, Gingy is overjoyed, but gets uncomfortable with Sugar becoming overly attached to him. He finally escapes and gets over it by knocking her into the mixer which created thousands of zombie [[cloning|clones]] of herself that attacked Gingy and ate him.\n\n===Other characters===\n\n====[[Cyclops]] Girl====\nShe is Cyclops's beautiful little daughter who appears briefly in ''Shrek the Third'' and loves her father. Her father brings his sweet little cyclops to work on \"Bring Your Kids To Work Day\", where Shrek is surprised to see her, but then gives the little cyclops a rub on the head and a compliment, telling her dad \"She's got your eye\".\n\n====[[Hansel and Gretel]]====\nHansel and Gretel appear in the second film's royal ball, walking on the red carpet and happy about Fiona's wedding. They appear to throw bread on the ground, puzzling the [[Joan Rivers]]-like commentator at the ball. They are also mentioned by the Fairy Godmother while she finds that ogres don't live happily ever after.\n\n====[[Little Boy Blue]]====\nHe grew up alongside Puss in Boots and Humpty Dumpty in the San Ricardo Orphanage and bullied the latter. His [[methemoglobinemia|skin is blue]].\n\nHe looks very similar to Butter Pants from [[Shrek Forever After]].\n\n====[[Little Red Riding Hood]]====\nLittle Red Riding Hood is shown at the beginning of ''Shrek 2'', coming to the gingerbread and cake house (from [[Hansel and Gretel]]) and running away leaving her basket behind after seeing Shrek and Fiona as ogres.\n\nShe also appears in [[Shrek 2 (video game)|''Shrek 2'' the game]] being voiced by [[Tara Strong]], and as a professional [[softball]] pitcher. Her slam is Basket of Utter Destruction. She has a different appearance in the two productions.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', Little Red Riding Hood was seen pickpocketing someone. She appears as a racer in the game ''[[Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing]]''. Her name in it is simply \"Red Riding Hood\", but her appearance is the same as in ''Shrek 2''. Her kart is the Big Bad Wolf, and her personal item is a picnic basket.\n\n====[[Mister Geppetto]]====\nMr. Geppetto (voiced by [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] in ''Shrek'' and ''Shrek Forever After'' and by Sean Bishop in ''Scared Shrekless'') is [[Pinocchio]]'s father. He is seen selling Pinocchio to Farquaad's army in the first film.\n\nIn ''Shrek Forever After'' Pinocchio tries to pass him off to Rumpelstiltskin as Shrek.\n\n====Miss [[Toad]]====\nMiss Toad (voiced by Wendy Bilanski) is seen at the Poison Apple Bar in the second film. She could be the toad that kidnapped [[Thumbelina]].\n\n====[[Seven Dwarfs]]====\n[[Snow White]]'s seven [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarves]] appear in the first film carrying Snow White's coffin. When the place the coffin on the table, Shrek says \"Oh no! Dead broad off the table.\" One of the Dwarfs says \"Where else are we supposed to put it? The bed's already been taken\" as Shrek finds the Big Bad Wolf in his bed.\n\nThey are seen again in ''Shrek 2'', when they give Shrek a ring engraved with \"I love you\" in flaming letters for Fiona (in an allusion to the [[One Ring]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''). In \"Shrek the Third\", one of them (Grumpy) is given to Fiona at her baby shower (as a [[babysitter]]) from Snow White who says she has six more at home. He is later seen again after the birth to babysit, only to be turned away by Shrek. They are seen at the end of ''Scared Shrekless'' when Shrek and Fiona celebrate by egging them. They have been voiced by various actors including [[Elisa Gabrielli]], David P. Smith, [[Walt Dohrn]], and Sean Bishop. In Shrek The Musical, it is revealed that Grumpy was the father of Lord Farquaad who kicked him out of his house because he was 28 and living in his basement.\n\n====[[The Little Mermaid]]====\nA [[mermaid]] resembling [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] from the Disney film ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' makes a cameo appearance during the \"[[Accidentally in Love]]\" scene in ''Shrek 2'', when Shrek and Fiona are on the beach during their honeymoon.

Fiona throws her back into the sea, where she is eaten by sharks (though it is not certain whether she is eaten by sharks or merely attacked).\n\n====[[There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe|The Old Lady in the Shoe]]====\nHer house is seen when Lord Farquaad consigns all the fairytale characters to Shrek's swamp. She was under the shoe with her children.\n\n====[[Peter Pan]]====\nPeter Pan (voiced by Michael Galasso) is seen in the first film waiting in line to sell Tinkerbell. His only line in the film is \"He can fly!\" (delivered when Tinkerbell inadvertently sprinkles fairy dust on Donkey).\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', Captain Hook mistakes a small boy in Far Far Away for Peter Pan where he quotes to his mother \"Shut it Wendy\" thinking that she is Wendy. Peter Pan is also a character in ''[[Shrek The Musical]]'', that is banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[Tinker Bell]]====\nTinker Bell is almost sold by [[Peter Pan]] in the first film, and it is her \"fairy dust\" that allows Donkey to fly temporarily. In ''Shrek 2'' she dances with Gingy during the ''Far Far Away Idol'' and is jarred and used as lighting for a mud bath with 17 other fairies. Things then become worse for the fairies, as Shrek and Fiona are then farting in the mud, which the fairies wave away. She uses her magic to turn Puss's boots into dancing ones during the ''Far Far Away Idols''. She is also a player in ''Shrek 2 the video game'', helping to rescue Shrek, Donkey, Puss, Little Red Riding Hood, the Big Bad Wolf and the Gingerbread Man.\n\nIn the game ''[[Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing]]'', she makes a cameo in the Potion Factory Exterior Track. She is the purple fairy that flies across the track, and if any character hits her, they will spin out.\n\n====[[The Story of the Three Bears|The Three Bears]]====\nPapa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear (voiced by [[Bobby Block]]) appear in the first film among the fairytale characters captured by Lord Farquaad's troops as Baby Bear tells his parents \"This cage is too small.\" They are among the fairy tale character that are sent to Shrek's swamp, and in the party at the end of the film. In ''Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing'', Papa Bear is used as a kart for Goldilocks, but is not a playable character.\n\nIn ''Shrek Superslam'', there is a bearskin rug (most likely Mama Bear, as there was a bow on her head) in one of the secret arenas. They also appear in ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'', and are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[Tom Thumb]] and [[Thumbelina]]====\nTom Thumb and Thumbelina walk together on the red carpet at Fiona and Shrek's wedding ball. They are both ignominiously swept up with the debris cluttering the red carpet, and they fail to attend the ball. Tom Thumb pushes Thumbelina in front of him as they are swept up.\n\n====[[Captain of the Guard]]s====\nThe Captain of the Guard (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]] in ''Shrek'' and [[Andrew Adamson]] in ''Shrek 2'') first appears in the first film  as the commander of Farquaad's army and his personal aide. A similar character reappears in Shrek 2 but is now the head of King Harold's army.\n\n====[[Quasimodo]]====\nQuasimodo (voiced by [[Nolan North]]) appears in ''[[Shrek SuperSlam]]'' where he moves in next door to Shrek's swamp. He plays his bells at 4:00 AM while Shrek and Fiona are trying to sleep. When he won't stop playing his bells, this leads to Shrek and Fiona fighting him.\n\n===Appearing in Shrek the Musical===\nThe following characters appear in ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'':\n\n====Shrek's parents====\nShrek's ogre parents appear at the beginning of the musical. They send Shrek out of their home at his seventh birthday, for him to live by himself.\n\nShrek's father was mentioned in ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' when Shrek talks with Artie about their fathers, according to Shrek in that scene, his father tried to [[Cannibalism|eat him]].\n\nIt is unknown what their fates are as they never appear in the films.\n\n====[[Fairy godmother|Fairy Godmother]]====\nA Fairy Godmother different from the one seen in ''Shrek 2'' appears in ''Shrek the Musical'' and is banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[Gnome]]====\nA Gnome appears in the Seattle Try-out & Broadway Line-Up of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[The Hatter|Mad Hatter]]====\nThe Mad Hatter appears in the West End Line-Up version of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale character that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[Shoemaking|Shoemaker]]'s [[Elf]]====\nBased on one of the elves from ''[[The Elves and the Shoemaker]]'', it appears in the Seattle Try-out & Broadway Line-Up and US National Tour Line-Up versions of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====Sugarplum [[Fairy]]====\nBased on the Sugarplum Fairies from ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', the Sugarplum Fairy appears in all three versions of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[The Ugly Duckling]]====\nThe Ugly Duckling appeared in all three versions of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]]====\nTweedledum and Tweedledee appear in the West End Line-Up version of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[White Rabbit]]====\nThe White Rabbit appeared in the Seattle Try-out & Broadway Line-Up and West End Line-Up versions of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====The Cow Who Jumped Over the Moon====\nThe Cow Who Jumped Over the Moon appears in the Travel Song where she jumps over the moon as Shrek and Donkey walk on their way to rescue Fiona.\n\nThe character is mentioned in \"The Pig Who Cried Werewolf\" when The Three Little Pigs remember when Heimlich claimed that he has seen an OVNI, but Dieter says that was just the Cow who jumped over the moon\n\n====The Dish and the Spoon====\nThe Dish and the Spoon appear in the Travel Song where they run away as Shrek and Donkey walk on their way to rescue Fiona. The Dish and the Spoon are having a conversation and somehow being pursued by the police, it is unknown if they escaped or got arrested.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n{{cleanup|section|reason=This

of [[Character (arts)|characters]] that appear in the ''[[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek]]'' franchise and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] from it.\n\n==Main characters==\n\n===Shrek===\n{{Main|Shrek (character)}}\n'''Shrek''' (voiced by [[Mike Myers]], [[Michael Gough (voice actor)|Michael Gough]] as his official voice in the video games) is the lead character in of all of the films. He prides himself on being a big, green, terrifying [[ogre]] and is ill-tempered and rude. He begins the series as an unsociable hermit until he meets his soon-to-be best friend, Donkey. In a deal with Lord Farquaad, he and Donkey embark on a quest to save Princess Fiona from the castle in which she was confined. Despite their differences, Shrek and Fiona fall in love, marry at the end of the first film, and have three ogre babies in the third film. [[Chris Farley]] was originally set to play Shrek, but he died before he could complete his voice work (he finished 80-90% of the film or according to his brother Tom, 95%).\n\nIn ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space]]'', a woman mistakes The Missing Link as Shrek.\n\n===Donkey===\n{{Main|Donkey (Shrek)}}\n'''Donkey''' (voiced by [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Mark Moseley (actor)|Mark Moseley]] as his official voice in the video games, and [[Dean Edwards]] in ''[[Scared Shrekless]]'') is a talking [[donkey]]. He is cheerful, talkative, optimistic, irritating, hypochondriac and half worried, but kind-hearted and brave when need be. He escaped being sold by his owner, an old woman, and eventually met and allied with Shrek. He is Shrek's best friend, but it always bothers or irritates the ogre. He has also become the frequent companion of the honorable mercenary Puss In Boots, although the two always fight or disagree from one another. Donkey loves to sing and hum, as seen in all the franchise films. He is also the Dragon's husband and father of the Dronkeys, whose passion for sweets inspired the name of each one of them.\n\n===Princess Fiona===\n{{Main|Princess Fiona}}\n'''Princess Fiona''' (voiced by [[Cameron Diaz]], singing voice provided by [[Sally Dworsky]] in the first film, [[Renee Sands]] on all other occasions, and [[Holly Fields]] in the video games) is the princess of Far Far Away, the daughter of late King Harold and Queen Lillian, cousin of King Arthur Pendragon, and Shrek's wife from the end of the first film on. She begins the series as a beautiful princess who transforms into an [[ogre]]ss every night when the sun sets. At the end of the first film, the transforming spell is broken and she permanently takes the form of an ogress when she realizes that Shrek is her true love.\n\n===Puss In Boots===\n{{Main|Puss In Boots (Shrek)}}\n'''Puss In Boots''' (voiced by [[Antonio Banderas]] in the English, Spanish, and Italian versions of the films, [[Eric Bauza]] in ''The Adventures of Puss In Boots'', vocal sounds and purrs were provided by [[Frank Welker]], and [[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]] in the video games and commercials) is Shrek's best friend along with Donkey. Loosely based on the [[fairy tale]] character [[Puss In Boots]] as well as being a kind of parody of [[Zorro]], he is a smooth-talking cat with a Spanish accent, usually wearing a cavalier's hat, a belt with a sword, a small black cape, and small Corinthian leather boots. Puss first appears in ''[[Shrek 2]]'', much like Dragon in the first film. He often overpowers his enemies by distracting them with his \"cute kitten\" looks. He also exhibits common cat behavior such as coughing up [[hairball]]s and chasing lights, usually resulting in his defeat or capture. For obvious reasons, he does not appear in [[Shrek|the first film]] or [[Shrek 4-D|4D ride]], though he does make a non-speaking cameo in the [[Shrek The Musical|musical]].\n\nThe character was also featured in the 2011 film ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss In Boots]]'' as the lead character.\n\nPuss In Boots stars in the [[Netflix]] series ''[[The Adventures of Puss in Boots]]'', where he protects the hidden city of San Lorenzo.\n\n==Secondary characters==\n\n===Dragon===\n'''Dragon''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) is depicted as a ruby-colored dragon who debuts as a ferocious guard challenging Shrek and Donkey in their quest to locate Princess Fiona. She is angered when Donkey accidentally disturbs her sleep and as Donkey attempts to distract her, he comes to the realization that Dragon is female, and successfully manages to charm his way to her heart. Though initially he is terrified of Dragon and wants nothing to do with her, Donkey later changes his mind and decides to give her a chance after he sees her crying over his rejection. While she plays a major role in this film, she reappears towards its conclusion at the marriage ceremony of Fiona and Shrek, in which Donkey takes her as his own mate. They are shown as a married couple by the events of the [[sequel]]; her character has a major role as Donkey chooses to leave home on the grounds that she was behaving uncharacteristically ill-tempered, but is reunited with her husband towards the ending of the movie when it appears that her grouchy behavior was a result of [[pregnancy]], and presents Donkey with their newborn hybrid children, the Dronkeys.\n\nDragon's importance in the films has been known to shift and revert every now and again, she is usually depicted as Donkey's romantic interest, and seems to be acquainted with Fiona and the princesses featured in the films. She often appears as a running gag because of the convenient possibilities presented by her abilities, albeit she can serve as an effective means of protection because of these as well (such as her consumption of Farquaad towards the end of the first film, which Donkey insists in ''Scared Shrekless'' was an accident). A silent character, Dragon has no spoken lines throughout the course of the franchise, though other characters, including Donkey, are able to somewhat understand her language when she communicates through hushed roars.\n\nDragon appears in all 4 ''Shrek'' movies and ''[[Shrek 4-D]]''. She is notably absent from ''Scared Shrekless'' and ''Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular'', and neither was she mentioned in the latter film.\n\n===The Gingerbread Man===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[The Gingerbread Man (Shrek)]] -->\nThe '''[[The Gingerbread Man|Gingerbread Man]]''' (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]]) is a live talking [[gingerbread man]] and one of Shrek's friends. He is also known as \"Gingy\" and was created by [[#The Muffin Man|The Muffin Man]]. He is small and a fast runner, making him difficult to catch. He is made out of a normal carved-out gingerbread with icing and gumdrop buttons. He adores those buttons and begs Lord Farquaad not to pull them off. In ''Shrek the Halls'' he is afraid of Santa, who has eaten his girlfriend.\n\nIn the first film, he is first seen when Lord Farquaad ordered his bodyguard Thelonious to torture him in numerous ways, such as cutting off both of his legs and dunking him in a glass of milk. After an [[interrogation]] from Farquaad, he is thrown into a trash can when the Magic Mirror arrives and Gingy yells \"Don't tell him anything!\"\n\nHe is impatient. In ''Shrek 2'', for example, when Pinocchio could not move himself while freeing Shrek and the trio from prison, Gingy sighs, and goes to help. He is also somewhat wild, and a prankster. When Shrek and Fiona leave for Far Far Away, he and others have a loud party in his house. He is cunning and can distract others, such as when Lord Farquaad demands to know where the other fairy tale creatures are and he replies by reciting the [[The Muffin Man|Muffin Man nursery rhyme]], which Farquaad believes for a moment.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', when Prince Charming takes over Far Far Away, he has Hook attempt to intimidate him to reveal Shrek's whereabouts. Instantly, Gingy's life flashes before his eyes, while in reality, he is mindlessly babbling away.\n\nIn ''Shrek Forever After'', he is shown to have a dark, violent side. In an alternate universe with Rumpelstiltskin as king, he fights and kills gingerbread animals as a gladiator for a living. He also tries to attack and bring in Shrek for Rumpel, despite being so much smaller. He is eaten by an overweight Puss in Boots in the alternate universe, but is seen alive again at the ogre triplets birthday party when the original timeline is restored.\n\n===King Arthur Pendragon{{anchor|Arthur_Pendragon}}===\n'''[[King Arthur|Arthur Pendragon]]''' (voiced by [[Justin Timberlake]]) [[James Arnold Taylor]] in videogames is the current king of Far Far Away, cousin of Princess Fiona, cousin-in-law of Shrek, and nephew of Queen Lillian and the late King Harold. Arthur is a supporting character who only appears in ''Shrek the Third'' and is loosely based on [[King Arthur]]. He is the only heir apparent to the throne of Far Far Away. His father abandoned him at the high school Worcestershire, where he remains until Shrek finds him.\n\nAt Worcestershire, Arthur, nicknamed Artie, is relentlessly bullied and made fun of by everyone, most notably the popular [[Lancelot]]. He is at first unsure when confronted with the trials of being king, but gets used to the idea and manages to convince people to his way of thinking when he defends and saves Shrek from the fairy tale villains. After Prince Charming's defeat, Shrek gives him the choice to do so. then Artie puts the crown on his head and begins his reign as King of Far Far Away.\n\nArtie does not appear in ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' and is never mentioned. He was supposed to appear, but Justin Timberlake was unavailable to voice Artie because he was on tour, so he was absent from the film.\n\n=== {{Anchor|Big Bad Wolf}}The Big Bad Wolf ===\nThe '''[[Big Bad Wolf]]''' (voiced by [[Aron Warner]]) [[James Arnold Taylor]] in videogames is based loosely on the eponymous fairytale character, but differs from it by being a kind character. He rarely speaks, and when he does, his voice is somewhat dull and monotonous. He wears a pink dress, recalling the grandmother of [[Little Red Riding Hood]]. In the first film, he is among the fairy-tale creatures who are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\nIn ''Shrek 2'', he has become friends with Shrek and the others. In the film's intro, Prince Charming goes to Fiona's castle to rescues her but finds Wolf in her bed. He informs Charming that Fiona is on honeymoon with Shrek (Charming and Fairy Godmother mention this incident calling Wolf a 'gender-confused wolf'). He helps Shrek and Princess Fiona by guarding their swamp while they visit Far Far Away. He and the others later travel to Far Far Away to free Shrek, Puss In Boots and Donkey, who have been captured. After that, they get into the castle and stop the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', he and several other fairytale characters attend Fiona's baby shower while Shrek, Donkey, and Puss In Boots are away. When Charming and his evil followers crash the party, the Big Bad Wolf and the others stage a calm tea party. He also helps prevent Charming and the other evil fairytale creatures from killing Shrek in front of the entire kingdom.\n\nHe plays a small role in ''Shrek Forever After'' in the ogre triplets' birthday party and as Rumpelstiltskin's servant in the alternate universe.\n\nIn ''The Pig Who Cried Werewolf'', it is shown that in the light of a full moon, he transforms\u2014werewolf-style\u2014into a fat, female human chef who wants to cook the Three Little Pigs. (Just as the full moon would transform a human into a werewolf, it apparently goes the other way with Wolf, transforming him into a human.)\n\n===Three Little Pigs===\nThe '''[[Three Little Pigs]]''' (voiced by [[Cody Cameron]]) are friends of Shrek. In the original book and in the film, they are among the many fairytale creatures to be banished into Shrek's swamp by [[Lord Farquaad]]. One of the pigs stated that Lord Farquaad \"huffed and puffed and signed an eviction notice.\" They all have German accents. They appear in all the ''Shrek'' films.\n\nBy ''Shrek 2'', the pigs have become best friends with Shrek. At the start of the film, they help look after Shrek's and Fiona's house while they visit Far Far Away. Later, they see Shrek, Donkey and Puss In Boots arrested by local police officers in Far Far Away, and free them, heading to the castle to stop Prince Charming. They thwart the Fairy Godmother's scheme and then celebrate. They sing a song with Wolf Wolf in ''Far Far Away Idol''.\n\nThe pigs are less prominent in the third film. They appear at the start of the film, where Prince Charming has a new job as an actor in a dinner theatre. Along with the rest of the crowd, they jeer him, causing Charming to leave the stage. They later appear in the castle pretending to have tea with the others while Shrek, Donkey and Puss In Boots are finding Artie, the heir to the throne, and Fiona, Queen Lillian and the princesses escape via a secret passage. Prince Charming storms in and demands Shrek's location. Under pressure when Pinocchio starts talking around in circles, one of the pigs reveals Shrek's plan and ends up locked up somewhere secret. The pigs are later freed and head to the castle to stop Prince Charming from killing Shrek in his show.\n\nThe Three Little Pigs play a small part in ''Shrek Forever After'', when they appear at the ogre triplet's birthday party. Later, in the alternate universe, they appear as attendants to Fifi in Rumpelstiltskin's castle.\n\nIn ''[[Scared Shrekless]]'', they appear after Gingy's story, running quickly and yelling \"wee wee wee...\", upon which the Wolf comments \"They're gonna do that all the way home.\"\n\nIn the end credits for ''The Pig Who Cried Werewolf'', it is revealed that their names are Heimlich, Dieter, and Horst. In this film, they are voiced by Sean Bishop, not Cody Cameron, who voices \"Horst\". Aron Warner still voices Wolf.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek The Musical]]'', they have had enough of Lord Farquaad and his discrimination towards fairy tale creatures and join the rest of the fairy tale rebels in this story mainly appearing in \"Story of my Life,\" \"Freak Flag,\" \"I'm a Believer,\" \"This is Our Story,\" and any other numbers with the fairy tale creatures.\n\n===Pinocchio===\n'''[[Pinocchio]]''' (voiced by [[Cody Cameron]]) is a live wooden [[puppet]] and one of Shrek's best friends. He could not lie without having his nose growing very long, and he deeply dreams to become a real boy.\n\nIn the first film, he is sold for five shillings by his creator, [[Mister Geppetto|Geppetto]]. Later, Lord Farquaad banishes Pinocchio and others to Shrek's swamp. In ''Shrek 2'', Pinocchio has become one of Shrek's best friends. He helps Shrek and [[Princess Fiona]] by guarding their swamp while they visit Far Far Away. He and the others later travel to Far Far Away to free Shrek, Puss In Boots, and Donkey, who have been captured. They manage to get into the castle and stop the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming. After trying to grab the Fairy Godmother's wand, she zaps him with it and he turns into a real boy, but when the wand is passed to The Three Blind Mice it transforms Pinocchio back into a puppet. He sings \"[[Mr. Roboto]]\" in ''[[Far Far Away Idol]]''.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', Pinocchio attends Fiona's baby shower along with several other fairytale creatures, while Shrek, Donkey, and Puss In Boots are away. Charming and his followers crash the party and try to trick Pinocchio into telling them of Shrek's location, seeing that the puppet cannot lie; however, Pinocchio avoids this by talking in circles. When Shrek and his company return, they find Pinocchio imprisoned in a miniature theater, where he is forced to give marionette performances for paying customers. He is freed and helps to defeat Charming and the other evil fairytale creatures.\n\nIn ''Shrek Forever After'', Pinocchio runs a library, in which Rumpelstiltskin is angrily tearing the pages of a book. Noticing that, he warns him that he has to pay for the damaged book. When Rumplestiltskin tries to deceive him by offering him a deal to become a real boy, Pinocchio kicks him out of the library, calling him \"Stinky-pants\" before he slams the door. Later, in the alternate universe, he nearly signs a contract with Rumpelstiltskin to become a real boy, but ink is accidentally spilled over the document. He later tries to gain Rumpelstiltskin's \"deal of a lifetime\" by painting Geppetto green and passing him off as Shrek.\n\nPinocchio is a main character in ''[[Shrek SuperSlam]]'', his Slam move being the Buzz Bomber. According to the story, Pinocchio works at Friar's Fat Boy. Pinocchio also appears as an unlockable racer in the game ''[[Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing]]''. His kart is a wooden horse, and his personal item is his long nose.\n\nIn the ''Shrek'' musical, Pinocchio was originally performed by [[John Tartaglia]]. Also during the musical, Pinocchio, with the help of the Fairytale Creatures, learns the meaning of being true to yourself; and the meaning of what makes a family.\n\nIn ''Scared Shrekless'', he talks faster than any other film. He appears in the last story called \"The Shreksorcist.\" In one part, he is acting to sleep and then Shrek cuts his strings using adult scissors causing him to fall on the bed and Pinocchio explains that he has voices in his head and Shrek asks what do the voices tell him to do and Pinocchio projectile vomits at Shrek. In the end, the voice in Pinocchio's head was [[The Talking Cricket|a cricket]] who explains that he put all the thoughts in his head because he is his conscience, at which point Pinocchio steps on and crushes him.\n\n===Three Blind Mice===\nThe '''[[Three Blind Mice]]''' (voiced by [[Christopher Knights]] and [[Simon J. Smith]] in most films, [[Mike Myers]] in ''Shrek in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party'') are a trio of identical blind [[mouse|mice]] brothers with English accents that are friends with Shrek and the others. They are all blind, and that is why they sport black sunglasses and carry canes. Unlike in the fairy tale, their tails are not cut off and they do not display signs of injuries. Their names are Forder, Gorder and Horder.\n\nAt the beginning of the first film, Lord Farquaad banishes them to Shrek's swamp with the others. They are not seen again until the final musical number, \"[[I'm a Believer]]\", during which the fairies of Sleeping Beauty turn two of them into horses to pull a wagon made from an onion.\n\nBefore the start of ''Shrek 2'', the Three Blind Mice have become three of Shrek's best friends. They help Shrek and Princess Fiona by guarding their swamp while they visit Far Far Away. They are later seen during the Royal Far Far Away Ball and again when Shrek (in his human form) is thrown into a police truck. On hearing this, the Blind Mice and the others travel to Far Far Away to free Shrek, Puss In Boots and Donkey. They then get into the castle and help to stop the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming. They later appear in ''Far Far Away Idol'', singing \"[[I Can See Clearly Now]].\"\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', the Three Blind Mice only appear in two scenes: during the funeral of King Harold, and when Shrek is about to leave to find the new king of Far Far Away.\n\nIn ''Shrek Forever After'', the mice are only seen in the normal universe.\n\n===Dronkeys===\n'''Dronkeys''' are the hybrid offspring of Dragon and Donkey. They are introduced in ''Shrek 2'' as little more than a [[post-credits scene|stinger gag]]. Audience members missed having [[Dragon (Shrek)|Dragon]] in the film, as was revealed to the filmmakers during test screenings.<ref>{{cite video| people = [[Andrew Adamson]], [[Kelly Asbury]]| title = [[Shrek 2]]|medium = DVD|publisher = [[DreamWorks Animation]]|date = 2004}}</ref> Dragon reunites with Donkey in Far Far Away, only to have a surprise for him in tow\u2014six young hybrid donkey-dragon children, who take to their father immediately. Donkey is delighted, and dubs the dronkeys \"our little mutant babies\". Their names are revealed to be Eclair, Bananas, Peanut, Parfait, Coco and Debbie.\n\nThe dronkeys have very little screen time in ''Shrek the Third''. They appear initially to give Shrek a wake up call, then to bid farewell to Donkey before his journey with Shrek. Near the film's climax, Donkey frees them from Prince Charming's capture. In addition, a few dronkeys make an appearance at the film's close, when Shrek and Fiona are caring for their [[#Farkle, Fergus, and Felicia|newborn triplets]]. In the alternate universe, when Donkey is told he has children, he asks: \"Tell me, are my babies cute, or do they just make people feel uncomfortable?\"\n\nThe dronkeys provide background action in the Christmas television special. They are featured playing with the ogre children of Shrek and Fiona and flying around while their mother dances. They have antlers and fly around in [[Shrek (franchise)#Donkey\u2019s Caroling Christmas-tacular|Donkey's Christmas story]]. All the dronkeys love their parents, especially their father, and seem to have become good friends with the ogre triplets.\n\nThe only individual to be given any semblance of a personality is Bananas, who has bright green [[Iris (anatomy)|irises]] that are noticeably [[Strabismus|wall-eyed]], and frequently sneezes small tongues of flame. [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] refers to Bananas as \"my special boy\".\n\nSome confusion exists as to why one dronkey is missing in ''Shrek The Third''. When the dronkeys were first introduced in the post-credits scene of \"Shrek 2\", there were six, including a unique individual which was red like her mother. She does not appear in ''Shrek the Third''; this is seemingly a [[continuity (fiction)|continuity error]] on the part of the filmmakers.\n\nIn ''Shrek Forever After'', the dronkeys are seen playing with Shrek's children, appeared at their birthday and also a cause of nuisance for Shrek. They are not seen in the alternate universe as they do not exist on that timeline.\n\nThe Dronkeys were absent from ''Scared Shrekless'', and neither were they mentioned.\n\n===Farkle, Fergus, and Felicia===\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Ogre Triplets (Shrek)]] -->\n'''Farkle, Fergus and Felicia''' (also known as the '''Ogre Babies''' or '''Ogre Triplets''') are the [[ogre]] children of Shrek and Princess Fiona. Farkle (indicated by the tuft of hair) and Fergus are male, and Felicia is female (indicated by a pink bow in her hair).\n\nJust as many minor characters are members of the staff crew, the Ogre Triplets are voiced by offspring of staff crew, gender of voice not always same as actor: Jordan Alexander Hauser, Dante James Hauser, Jasper Johannes Andrews, Zachary James Bernard, Miles Christopher Bakshi, Nina Zoe Bakshi and Ollie Mitchell (son of ''Shrek Forever After'' director Mike Mitchell).<ref>asin B002ZG9904 Shrek Ever After DVD Extras Director Commentary</ref>\n\nIn ''Shrek 2'' when Queen Lillian asks Shrek how he and Fiona will raise their family, Shrek insists it's too early to discuss this issue. In ''Shrek the Third'', Fiona tries to talk Shrek into the possibility of parenthood by saying when they return to their swamp, there could be some little \"ogre feet\" too, but Shrek is too worried about his inexperience as a parent to pursue this idea right now. Just as Shrek embarks on a journey with Donkey and Puss in Boots to find Artie, Fiona announces to Shrek that she is pregnant, and Shrek begins to panic internally. During the journey, Shrek dreams of hundreds of ogre babies, constantly getting into danger and him having trouble saving them. In the dream, they flood Shrek's house and laugh at Shrek while he is naked apart from a graduation hat. He wakes up in another dream, where Donkey and Puss's faces have turned to that of the ogre babies. Shrek wakes up screaming and reveals to Puss and Donkey how shocked he is by this news. Donkey attempts to assure Shrek fatherhood will not ruin his life. Shrek says he is worried about ruining his child's life as ogres aren't known for being loving and nurturing. His fears prove to be well-founded when he reveals to Artie his own abusive father, who tried to eat him. By the end of the film, they have been born and are shown playing around the swamp, Shrek and Fiona getting used to being their parents, with the help of Puss, Lillian, Donkey and Dragon.\n\nTwo of them pull Puss's tail and put a pacifier into his mouth. Another pulls some ear wax from Shrek's ear and uses it to draw pictures with its left hand. Later that night, they are shown sleeping and snoring, all in one small baby cot. Shrek and Fiona constantly give them slug juice for drinks. The ogre babies are shown prominently in the credits, along with Puss in Boots and Donkey. Two of the siblings are shown to like Puss, hugging him tightly and call him \"Kitty\". Puss is displeased when they use him for tug-o-war.\n\nThey are seen more in ''Shrek the Halls'', enjoying the seasons with their father and ecstatically enjoying their first Christmas with their parents. When Donkey brings the others to enjoy the holidays with them, the ogre babies hug Puss too tightly, pat his back, and tug on his tail. They enjoy various Christmas stories and get to see [[Santa Claus]] at the end.\n\nThe triplets do not appear in the alternate universe in ''Shrek Forever After'' as Shrek and Fiona meet, but do not marry in that universe. Shrek later finds Felicia's doll in his pocket, causing him to cry. As Shrek begins to fade away as his day is up, he tells Fiona about their children, just before she kisses him, restoring the timeline.\n\nIn ''Scared Shrekless'', they appear at the beginning, scaring the trick or treaters in their skeleton costume. They are later seen along with their father, using the three in a knight armor in Duloc, in order to make Donkey believe that Lord Farquaad's ghost is there as a prank.\n\n===Queen Lillian===\n'''[[Queen consort|Queen]] Lillian''' (voiced by [[Julie Andrews]]<ref name=\"movieweb.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/24/1024/gal1610/20.php|title=Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews) and King Harold (John Cleese) learn that they may rule the kingdom, but they don't rule their daughter's heart|work=MovieWeb|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"film.guardian.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/pictures/image/0,8545,-10304954831,00.html|title=Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews) and King Harold (John Cleese)|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref>) is the queen of Far Far Away, widow of King Harold, mother of Princess Fiona, aunt of King Arthur Pendragon, grandmother of the ogre triplets, and mother in-law of Shrek.\n\nQueen Lillian makes her debut in ''Shrek 2''. Although initially surprised at Fiona's transformation into an ogre, she is understanding of what has happened and, seeing that her daughter is deeply in love and happy, accepts Shrek into their family. When King Harold is turned back into the Frog King at the end of the film, she still accepts him as she did years ago. She and Harold are a reference to ''[[The Frog Prince (story)|The Frog Prince]]''.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', she is widowed and becomes a more determined character, leading the pack of princesses through a series of tunnels in the castle and breaking two walls with her head, whilst humming \"[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]\" and \"[[A Spoonful of Sugar]]\" (songs originally sung by Julie Andrews in ''The Sound of Music'' and ''Mary Poppins'', respectively). She rallies the other princesses from being damsels in distress to independent fighters. It is revealed in the film that Fiona inherited her fighting skills from her mother (Lillian asks \"Well, you didn't think you got your fighting skills from your father, did you?\"). After the film's finale, Lillian is seen in Shrek's swamp home, happily visiting her grandchildren and playing with Farkle, who throws up on her dress. At first she is shocked, but this changes as she comes to find it adorable.\n\nShe appears at her grandchildren's birthday party in \"Shrek Forever After\" and gets angry when she thinks that it was Shrek who licked the birthday cake, when it in fact was Donkey. Lillian is also seen in a number of flashbacks, showing her and Harold's decision to visit Rumpelstiltskin to free their daughter from the curse before getting the news that she had been saved. In the alternate universe she and Harold disappear after signing over the kingdom to Rumpelstiltskin. Her last appearance is at the end of the film, still celebrating the children's birthday.\n\nIn ''Thriller Night'', Shrek and his family watch ''The Music of Sound'', starring Queen Lillian. This is a parody of ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' which starred Queen Lillian's voice actress, ''[[Julie Andrews]]''.\n\n===King Harold===\n'''[[King]] Harold''' (voiced by [[John Cleese]]) was the king of Far Far Away, late husband of Queen Lillian,<ref name=\"movieweb.com\"/><ref name=\"film.guardian.co.uk\"/> late father of Princess Fiona, late uncle of King Arthur Pendragon, and late father in-law of Shrek.\n\nKing Harold makes his debut in ''Shrek 2''. When his daughter Fiona arrives at the castle with her new husband, he is surprised and appalled that they are both ogres. He had secretly made a promise to the Fairy Godmother that her son Prince Charming would marry Fiona. Harold hires Puss In Boots to assassinate Shrek, but then succumbs to guilt when Fiona finds out that Shrek is missing. When the Fairy Godmother asks Harold to give Fiona the potion that will cause her to fall in love with Prince Charming, he refuses at first, disgusted at this invasion of her [[free will]], but he is forced to acquiesce by some dark threat of disclosure. In the event, when Fiona states that she loves the old Shrek, rather the new one that Prince Charming is pretending to be, Harold swaps the cup containing the potion for his own.\n\nAt the ball toward the end of the film, Harold saves Fiona and Shrek from a blast of magic from Fairy Godmother's wand, and it transforms him back into a frog, which is revealed to be his original form, before he married Queen Lillian. Afterwards, Harold apologizes to Shrek and warmly accepts him into the family, and as he decides to leave believing that he is not the man Lillian deserved, she comforts him by saying that he is more that man now than he ever was when he was a human.\n\nKing Harold makes a very brief final appearance as the frog king in ''Shrek the Third'', in which Shrek and Fiona fill in for him and Lillian during his illness, which later turns out to be terminal (The story book ''The Legend of Shrek'' and other publications state that the transition from human to frog confused his age and accelerated the aging process). He tells Shrek on his deathbed about Fiona's cousin Arthur is next in line to the throne of Far Far Away, when Shrek and Fiona both reject an ogre and ogress as king and a lady in-wating, is a bad idea given their inexperiences and disastrous attempts to fill in for him. Harold dies shortly after telling Shrek and Fiona, as he is never seen nor heard from again.\n\nKing Harold makes his cameo appearance in ''Shrek Forever After'', in which he appears very briefly in a couple of flashbacks only. In the first, he and Lillian are about to make a deal with Rumpelstiltskin, but they break it off at the last moment, after a royal messenger enters and informs them that Fiona has been saved. In the alternate reality of the second flashback, Harold and Lillian disappear after signing over the kingdom to Rumpelstiltskin. At the end of the film, the original timeline is restored, leaving the current time a year or so after Harold's death (as seen in ''Shrek the Third''). However, there is a large painting of him as a human in which the face moves, possibly indicating that his [[spirit]] inhabits the picture. Unlike the previous films, he is never seen in his frog form.\n\n==={{Anchor|Doris the Ugly Stepsister}}Doris===\n'''Doris''' (voiced by [[Larry King]] and [[Jonathan Ross]] in the UK version of [[Shrek 2]]) makes her first appearance in ''Shrek 2'' and returns in ''Shrek the Third'' and very briefly in ''Shrek Forever After''. She is based on one of [[Ugly sisters|Cinderella's two stepsisters]]. Unlike other ugly sisters, she is an ally and best friend to Fiona. She is first seen as an unusually masculine female [[bartender]] at the Poison Apple. She is depicted as a tall, independent woman with purple-themed clothes who wears Elizabeth Taylor style makeup. Her character design is intended to invoke the appearance of a [[drag queen]], which is supported with her masculine voice.\n\nDoris is first seen in ''Shrek 2'', when King Harold secretly enters the Poison Apple Club, in which she is working as a bartender. She recommends Puss In Boots to the king for the task of assassinating Shrek. Near the climax of the film, Doris directs King Harold to a door guarded by the Fairy Godmother's bodyguards, behind which Prince Charming and the Fairy Godmother are secretly meeting. At first, she has a crush on Prince Charming and forces him to kiss her at the end of the film. In ''Far Far Away Idol'', she is accused by [[Simon Cowell]] of being ugly after she sings Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\".<ref>Susan Wloszczyna, \"[https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2004-10-06-shrek2-dvd_x.htm Here comes the judge: Simon's a 'Shrek' extra],\" ''USA Today'' (10/6/2004).</ref>\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', Doris becomes one of Shrek's friends before the events of the film. At the beginning of the film, Doris is briefly mentioned by Mabel when Prince Charming visits the Poison Apple. Mabel says that Doris does not belong here, and this indicates that Doris has reformed from villainy and sided with Shrek. She is also seen during Fiona's baby shower, but she escapes with the other princesses through a hidden trapdoor when Charming starts to enter the castle. Later, she is imprisoned by Charming after he invades Far Far Away. With the princesses, Donkey and Puss, she escapes and infiltrates the castle to confront Charming. In the end, Doris and Mabel finally meet in Charming's play and reconcile when Artie convinces the villains not to continue their villainous ways when they didn't get their happily ever after.\n\nDoris appears very briefly in ''Shrek Forever After'', working at The Happy Apple (formerly The Poison Apple) during the ogre triplets' birthday party.\n\n===Snow White===\n'''[[Snow White]]''' (voiced by [[Amy Poehler]], singing voice provided by [[Megan Hilty]]) is one of Princess Fiona's friends. She has a talent for singing, which she uses to charm animals and make them follow her orders. She is shown to be very proud and vain, even boasting how she won Fairest In The Land from the Wicked Queen.\n\nIn the first film, Snow White cameos as one of the fairytale creatures to be banished to Shrek's swamp. She is shown sleeping inside her coffin and being handled{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} by her seven dwarves. When Lord Farquaad is forced to choose a wife, Snow White, seen sleeping in the glass coffin, is his second choice. At Shrek and Fiona's wedding, she fights with Cinderella to catch Fiona's bouquet.\n\nIn ''Shrek 2'', Snow White is briefly mentioned when the Fairy Godmother is explaining to Shrek that ogres do not live happily ever after.\n\nSnow White appears more prominently in ''Shrek the Third'', dressed in red. She becomes friends with Princess Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, Cinderella and the Sleeping Beauty before the events of the film. Prince Charming interrupts Fiona's baby shower after she gives her a dwarf as a gift to babysit the triplets, saying that she has six more at home. She escapes with Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris and the other princesses. She is later betrayed by Rapunzel and imprisoned in a dungeon. She complains that they could just have stayed put and carried on with their normal routines (having tea parties and similarly stereotypical \"girly\" behavior), claiming to not care who is in charge. Later she is content just to wait to be rescued, as normal for fairytale princesses.\n\nFiona encourages her and the others to show some initiative, and they manage to escape and head towards the castle. She tricks the guards (talking trees) by singing a high tone (using the same voice as in the Disney film) to charm the animals, and screaming (the same scream as in \"[[The Immigrant Song]]\" by [[Led Zeppelin]]) to command them to attack the trees. Her plan works and they enter the castle grounds, avoiding the knights guarding it. Snow White, along with the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian, arrives just in time to stop Prince Charming from killing Shrek. After Charming is defeated, she is seen in the background, talking to the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian.\n\nAlthough it is unclear whether Snow White is married, at one point she is seen with a tattoo on her upper arm with the name Dopey surrounded by a heart.\n\n===Cinderella===\n'''[[Cinderella]]''' (voiced by [[Amy Sedaris]]) is one of Princess Fiona's friends. She wears her pair of glass slippers throughout the events of ''Shrek the Third''. She uses her glass slipper as a weapon, somewhat like a boomerang. She is obsessed with cleanliness and tidiness after doing a great deal of housework for her stepmother and stepsisters (revealed to be Doris and Mabel).\n\nIn the [[Shrek 2 (video game)|''Shrek 2'' video game]], however, she is portrayed as an absent-minded [[valley girl]].\n\nWhen [[Lord Farquaad]] is forced to choose his wife so that he can become king, Cinderella is one of his choices. She is shown at number 1 in a painting, wearing a yellow dress and trying on her glass slipper. However, Farquaad chooses Princess Fiona, ranked number 3. At Shrek and Fiona's wedding, Cinderella is shown fighting with Snow White to catch Fiona's bouquet.\n\nIn ''Shrek 2'', Cinderella is briefly mentioned while the Fairy Godmother is explaining to Shrek that ogres do not live happily ever after. There is also a picture of her in Fairy Godmother's factory. This can be seen more clearly in a behind-the-scenes guide. Thus Fairy Godmother appears to be the evil twin sister of Cinderella's fairy godmother.\n\nCinderella appears more prominently in ''Shrek the Third'', now wearing a light blue-silver dress. She becomes friends with Princess Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, Snow White and the Sleeping Beauty prior to the events of the film. She first appears in Fiona's baby shower, which Prince Charming interrupts when he takes over the throne. She escapes with Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, and the other princesses. She is later betrayed by Rapunzel and imprisoned with others in a dungeon. They escape and head towards the castle. After Snow White tricks the guards, they enter the castle's grounds and avoid the knights on guard. While trying to get into the castle, Cinderella hurls her glass slipper like a boomerang at a knight, knocking him out. Cinderella, with the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian, arrives just in time to stop Prince Charming from killing Shrek. After Charming is defeated, she is seen talking to the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian in the background.\n\n===Sleeping Beauty===\n'''[[Sleeping Beauty]]''' (voiced by [[Cheri Oteri]]) is one of Princess Fiona's friends. She likes to sleep a lot. Because she sleeps so much in the film, little is known about her personality, other than that she seems to be a pleasant person who is a little eccentric at times.\n\nIn ''Shrek 2'', Sleeping Beauty is shown in a poorly drawn picture in Fiona's diary, explaining that Sleeping Beauty is having a party with all the other princesses, but Princess Fiona is not allowed to go, on account of the ogreish appearance she acquires every night. Later in the film, Sleeping Beauty appears without speaking when a coach-limousine pulls up at the red carpet to the Far Far Away Royal Ball. When the door opens, she falls to the ground, still sleeping. In the film, she wears a blue dress and a crown.\n\nSleeping Beauty appears more prominently in ''Shrek the Third'', now wearing a white-green dress, and with light brown hair.  She becomes friends with Princess Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, Snow White and Cinderella before the events of the film. She first appears in Fiona's baby shower, but Prince Charming interrupts it and takes over the throne. She escapes with Fiona, Queen Lillian, Doris, and the other princesses. She is later betrayed by Rapunzel and imprisoned with others in a dungeon. They escape and head towards the castle.\n\nAfter Snow White tricks the guards, they enter the castle's grounds, avoiding the knights on guard. While trying to get into the castle, Sleeping Beauty yawns and falls to the ground, causing the knights to trip over her and fall. With the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian, Sleeping Beauty arrives just in time to stop Prince Charming from killing Shrek. After Charming is defeated, she is seen talking to the other princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian in the background.\n\n===Merlin===\n'''[[Merlin]]''' (voiced by [[Eric Idle]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/blshrekthethirdpicsv.htm|title=Eric Idle voices Merlin in DreamWorks' \"Shrek the Third,\" to be released by Paramount Pictures in May 2007.|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref>) is a retired [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] teacher from Artie's high school, Worcestershire, in ''Shrek the Third''.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', after their ship crashes into sharp rocks, Shrek, Donkey, Puss and Artie get stranded on an island (possibly Lovers' Beach in Far Far Away). They meet Arthur's retired teacher Merlin, after Artie tries to separate himself from Shrek. Since Merlin retired because of a nervous breakdown (which he calls \"third-level fatigue\"), he seems rather eccentric, and his magic spells usually go wrong. At one point, when he prepares to teleport Shrek, Donkey, Puss and Artie to Far Far Away, he cracks his knuckles, only to fire a bolt that destroys a boulder.\n\nIn order to help Shrek and Arthur be reconciled, he makes them look into a thick cloud of smoke to reveal their thoughts. Shrek sees a baby carriage, but lies and says that he sees a \"rainbow pony\". Merlin is pleased and moves on to Arthur, who sees a bird and its father. The father bird abandons the chick, leaving it frightened and confused. Merlin is happy they decided to look into their soul, and as he retreats to his hut, Shrek takes the opportunity to show Arthur that they are not so different after all. They catch Merlin eavesdropping on their conversation when he plays the song \"That's What Friends Are For\" on a phonograph to add to the mood.\n\nWhen Captain Hook and his cronies ambush Shrek, Donkey, Puss and Artie, he plays his piano, and Merlin is beside him playing it too until he is pushed away. After the villains retreat, Artie convinces Merlin to use a spell to teleport them to Far Far Away. But the spell causes Donkey and Puss to switch bodies (probably because they took each other's \"hands\" seconds before). After Prince Charming's defeat, Merlin returns, and Puss and Donkey force him to put them back in their own bodies. The spell works, but causes their tails to switch. Merlin tries to tell them, but decides not to, though their tails have inexplicably returned to normal later.\n\nIn the first movie, he cameos as one of the fairy tale creatures banished to Shrek's swamp. He appears standing with the Big Bad Wolf and when Shrek asks if anyone knows Farquaad, they both point at each other. In the [[Shrek (video game)|video game]] to the first Shrek film, a different version of Merlin kidnaps Fiona.\n\n===Brogan===\n'''Brogan''' (voiced by [[Jon Hamm]]) is an [[ogre]] and the second-in-command of the Ogre Resistance in ''Shrek Forever After''. He uses his nose as their horn to communicate music. He's got really short, almost invisible, ginger hair and unshaven face. He's nice, kind and loyal. He is taller, bigger, more muscular and much more handsome than Shrek. He's possibly the strongest one of all ogres, because when the witches carry up all of the ogres with their Skull Chains, Brogan is too strong and he pulls the Skull Chains that are attached to him, so the Witches fall from their broomsticks.\n\nBrogan introduces Shrek into the resistance and is seen in the meeting with Fiona on how to fight against Rumpelstiltskin and the witches. When Pied Piper arrives and uses his flute, the song \"Shake Your Groove Thing\" is played, and Brogan cannot stop dancing. Later, he and the other ogres are captured, but they fight in the castle and defeat Rumpelstiltskin. He is also seen at the party in the end of the film.\n\nIn the audio commentary for the DVD release, Mike Mitchell states Brogan was originally meant to be Prince Charming, Fiona's love interest with the same curse as her, called \"Gnimrahc\", which is Charming spelled backwards.\n\n===Cookie===\n'''Cookie''' (voiced by [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) is an [[ogre]] and a [[chef]] for the Ogre Resistance in ''Shrek Forever After''. Although at first seeming to be male in appearance, Cookie identifies as a woman. Food is her only weapon against the witches and Rumpelstiltskin. Her signature dish is the [[chimichanga]], of which she takes a cartful to the ambush of Rumplestiltskin. Cookie is very recognizable due to the garlic she has tied into her goatee and a chef hat. She is a very outgoing and friendly ogre. She is the only ogre to enjoy dancing while Pied Piper plays his flute until she and the others are captured. She catapults her chimichangas at the witches during the final battle. She is also seen at the party in the end of the film.\n\n===Gretched===\n'''Gretched''' (voiced by [[Jane Lynch]]) is a female [[ogre]] who appears in the ''[[Shrek Forever After]]''. She is a member of the Ogre Resistance. She is one of the strong soldiers and she plays an important role in the Ogre Resistance. She is more of a stereotypical ogre as opposed to kind and delicate like Fiona, looking and behaving closer to like that of the other male ogres. She is also seen at the party in the end of the film.\n\n===Humpty Dumpty===\n'''[[Humpty Dumpty|Humpty Alexander Dumpty]]''' (voiced by [[Zach Galifianakis]]), in his childhood, was best friends with Puss and tried to find magic beans with him. However, their quest failed and Puss later became a revered hero in their hometown. Humpty grew jealous of Puss's fame and later tricked him into helping him rob a bank, thus branding Puss an outlaw. They were pursued by the authorities; Humpty was captured while Puss escaped. Seven years later, Humpty along with Kitty Softpaws convinced Puss to help him get magic beans from Jack and Jill to get the Golden Goose, but it was revealed that this was all a plot to just get Puss back home and arrested as revenge for abandoning him. But later Humpty had a change of heart and helped Puss and Kitty tame The Great Terror. In the end, he sacrifices himself to save San Ricardo and falls from the bridge, upon which his shell is broken, revealing him to be a golden egg.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek Super Slam]]'', he is known as Master Fu and is an unlockable character. In ''[[Shrek 4-D]]'', his grave can be seen in the cemetery.\n\nPuss In Boots mentions him in ''[[Puss in Boots: The Three Diablos]]''.\n\n===Kitty Softpaws===\nKitty (voiced by [[Salma Hayek]]) is a black [[tuxedo cat]]. She has a white chest, whiskers, muzzle, tail-tip, eyebrows and white paws. Her eyes are bright blue. She wears a brown belt in which she carries a long dagger, along with dark brown boots. Her fur is very thick. Her paws do not have claws because they were removed by her former owners, but this lends to her skill as an exceptional thief. She pretends to be Puss's friend, but it is revealed later that she was in cahoots with Humpty and Jack and Jill to steal the Golden Goose and trick Puss into being imprisoned in his home town. During their adventures, she falls in love with Puss, and eventually she saves him and helps him bring the Golden Goose back to the Great Terror. At the end of the movie, they are dancing flamenco and their dance leads to a passionate kiss, though it is revealed that they went their separate ways sometime after.\n\n==Main villains==\n\n===Lord Farquaad===\n{{Main|Lord Farquaad}}\n'''Lord Farquaad''' (voiced by [[John Lithgow]]) [[Andre Sogliuzzo]] in Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing is the narcissistic, ruthless and diminutive ruler of the huge castle of Duloc.\n\nIn his pursuit of perfection, Farquaad attempts to rid his domain of fairy tale creatures, offering a bounty for their capture and then exiling them to Shrek's swamp. Farquaad wants to become a king, but because he is not of royal blood, he cannot until he marries a princess. He decides that Princess Fiona will be his perfect wife and queen, but first she must be rescued from her tower, which is guarded by a fire-breathing dragon.\n\nUnwilling to perform the rescue himself, Farquaad holds a tournament to select the knight that will rescue Princess Fiona. But Shrek and Donkey turn up and defeat the knights, so Farquaad decides to send Shrek on the quest instead, agreeing to remove the fairytale creatures from his swamp if he rescues Fiona. Shrek delivers Fiona to Farquaad, who immediately proposes marriage, unaware that she becomes an ogress at sunset. Shrek disrupts the marriage ceremony, delaying a kiss between Farquaad and Fiona until after sunset.\n\nFiona makes the transition from human to ogre form, upon which Farquaad rejects his new bride, banishing her back to the tower, still claiming the title of king and sentencing Shrek to death. However, before Farquaad finishes his claims to the kingdom, Shrek whistles to summon Dragon, who has since developed a relationship with Donkey, and she crashes through the window and devours the monologuing Farquaad. Moments later, Dragon burps and the crown comes out of her mouth. Although he seemed to be feared and respected, Farquaad was apparently not well liked in Duloc, as when Dragon eats him, the citizens laugh and cheer.\n\nHe is confirmed to be dead when he enters as a ghost in the ''Shrek 4-D'' ride at Universal Studios and the 30-minute Shrek Special on the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon TV channel]], in which he tries to murder Shrek and Donkey and to kidnap and kill Fiona so that she can be his queen in the afterlife. Princess Fiona is again rescued when Lord Farquaad is presumably killed by Dragon a second time. In ''[[Scared Shrekless]]'', Farquaad is long dead, and his castle left in a decrepit state.\n\nLord Farquaad does not appear, nor is he mentioned in ''[[Shrek 2]]'', but he briefly appears in Gingy's flashbacks in ''[[Shrek the Third]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'', it is revealed that Lord Farquaad's mother was the princess from the fairy tale ''[[The Princess and the Pea]]''. Also, Lord Farquaad's father was Grumpy of the [[Seven Dwarfs]]. Farquaad claimed earlier that Grumpy abandoned him in the woods as a child, but Grumpy reveals the true reason he kicked Farquaad out is that he was 28 years old and wouldn't move out of his basement as revealed when he and the other fairy tale characters raid Lord Farquaad's wedding.\n\n===Fairy Godmother===\nThe '''[[Fairy godmother|Fairy Godmother]]''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Saunders]]) and by [[Claudia Christian]] in the videogames and by [[Pinky Turzo]] in Thriller Night, is a scheming, conniving [[wikt:opportunist|opportunist]], loosely based on the fairy-tale [[Cinderella]]'s \"[[Fairy Godmother]].\" She seeks to get the best for herself and her son [[#Prince Charming|Prince Charming]], rather than others. She takes an instant dislike to Shrek, and when he tries to ask her why Fiona is not happy, she rudely points out that \"ogres don't live happily ever after.\" She then briefly insults Shrek, calling his fingers \"dirty green sausages.\" She often resorts to blackmail and trickery through magic to get her way. She is a [[Emotional eating|stress eater]] (\"someone get me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate,\" when Shrek makes a mess of her potion factory, and during her talk with Harold in the carriage about Shrek, it is shown that Harold ruined her diet when she orders food from Friar's Fat Boy). It is a popular theory that she placed the spell on Fiona that makes her turn into an ogre at night as part of her plan to get Charming to marry her.\n\nBubbles are her character's main theme. In her first appearance, she is surrounded by bubbles as she sings to Fiona. When Shrek uses her card to ask for help, a voice mail message of her appears with her saying \"Is it on? Is it on?\" she is again surrounded by a bubble, which then shows an image of the Fairy Godmother's cottage. After the message ends, the bubble bursts. Finally when the Fairy Godmother dies, in an attempt to cast a spell to kill Shrek which is deflected onto her by King Harold's armor, she bursts into a host of bubbles. Her death later influences Charming to get revenge by taking over Far Far Away.\n\nAlthough The Fairy Godmother does not appear in ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', she is mentioned numerously by Prince Charming.\n\nThe Fairy Godmother is briefly mentioned by Lillian and Harold in the opening scene of ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' and makes a cameo during the end credits.\n\n===Prince Charming===\n'''[[Prince Charming]]''' (voiced by [[Rupert Everett]] in the second and third movie, [[Sean Bishop]] in ''Scared Shrekless'', James Arnold Taylor in videogames) is the son of the Fairy Godmother. He is very handsome, and was supposed to rescue Princess Fiona from her dragon-guarded tower.\n\nIn his first scene in ''Shrek 2'', he travels to the castle where Fiona had been imprisoned prior to the first film, only to discover that Shrek has already found and married her, and that the [[Big Bad Wolf (Shrek)|Big Bad Wolf]] has taken to sleeping in her tower.\n\nIt is later revealed that Charming is the son of the Fairy Godmother and that she wants him to marry Fiona so that he can become king. In contrast to his fairytale namesake, Prince Charming is characterized as an arrogant, vain and spoiled mama's boy, and she as his doting parent, as well as shallow about his appearance. He later deceives Fiona into believing that he is Shrek, having been turned human by a \"Happily Ever After\" potion. His heartless attitude shows through the disguise and Fiona realizes the truth, knocking him unconscious with a headbutt. At the end of the film, he is forcefully kissed by the ugly stepsister, Doris.\n\nHe sings \"[[I'm Too Sexy]]\" by \"[[Right Said Fred]]\" in ''Far Far Away Idol'', but because of his horrible singing, Fiona presses a button that opens a trap door below him and he falls into it. He is voiced here by Randy Crenshaw.<ref name=btva>[http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Shrek/Prince-Charming/ Behind the Actors: Prince Charming] Behind the Voice Actors, Retrieved April 16, 2016</ref>\n\nAs the main antagonist of ''Shrek the Third'', Charming gathers all the evil characters from fairy tales that were at the Poison Apple Bar to get their revenge and their \"Happily Ever Afters\". After they invade the main castle of Far Far Away, Charming prepares a stage show in which he will kill Shrek in front of the entire kingdom. Shrek takes part in the show, but his allies come to the rescue.\n\nArthur Pendragon then convinces the fairytale villains to give up their evil ways. Charming is furious and attacks Artie only to be stopped by Shrek, who throws him towards a prop tower made of stone. Dragon purposely knocks the tower over and it lands on Charming, crushing him to death.\n\nHe appears in ''[[Scared Shrekless]]'', in the story \"Boots Motel\" (made up by Donkey and Puss). This time, he is voiced by Sean Bishop.<ref name=\"btva\" />\n\nHe appears as a zombie and at the movie theater in Shrek's nightmare, in ''Thriller Night'', a ''Shrek'' parody of the short film ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Michael Jackson's Thriller]]''.\n\nRupert Everett's name appears in the cast list for ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', but Prince Charming has only a non-speaking cameo in the film, during the end credits. It's unknown why he didn't rescue Fiona in the alternate timeline, although it could be because she lost the throne of Far Far Away after her parents signed away their kingdom to Rumpelstiltskin and he knew he wouldn't gain anything by marrying her.\n\n===Rumpelstiltskin===\n'''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]''' (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]] in Shrek the Third, [[Walt Dohrn]] in subsequent media) is an evil short con man who makes magical deals (complete with contracts), but give them a horrible twist in fate for their lives. He has a giant pet [[goose]] named Fifi.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek the Third]]'', a different version of Rumpelstiltskin decides to join Prince Charming as an attempt for the other villains to get their happily ever after. And as with the other villains, this Rumpelstiltskin decided to quit being a villain.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', the story begins during the time frame of the first Shrek movie. King Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign their kingdom over to Rumpelstiltskin to break Fiona's curse, as Lilian believes that the Fairy Godmother cannot be trusted, though Harold is reluctant to trust Rumpelstiltskin. At the last moment, they learn that Fiona has been rescued from the tower and do not sign the contract. Rumpelstiltskin is then furious and vows revenge on Shrek.\n\nThe setting then moves forward to after ''Shrek the Third''. Seeing Shrek missing his old life as a free and terrifying ogre, Rumpelstiltskin makes a deal with him, tricking him into giving up the day he was born. This deal enables Rumpelstiltskin to be the ruler of Far Far Away by creating an alternate reality in which Shrek never existed and therefore never rescued Fiona, thus causing the king and queen to sign the contract which gave him their kingdom. Shrek tries to reverse the deal by using the exit clause - a true love's kiss - before 24 hours elapse and he disappears forever. Though this is proved difficult because in this reality, Fiona is a leader of a band of rebel ogres and takes an immediate dislike to Shrek, whom she does not know. Rumpelstiltskin has an army of witches to stop him and hires the Pied Piper to capture him and the other ogres. He succeeds in capturing all but Shrek and Fiona. When he offers anything in return for the one who brings Shrek to him, Shrek turns himself in, and in exchange has Rumpelstiltskin set the ogres free (though he keeps Fiona, as she is a human by day and therefore not completely an ogre). Rumpelstiltskin looses Dragon on Shrek and Fiona (who is still feral in this reality), but Puss, Donkey and the other ogres come to fight, and with Shrek and Fiona they defeat Rumpelstiltskin and his army of witches. By this time Shrek's 24 hours are almost up, but at the last second, Fiona kisses the fading Shrek, whom she now realizes that she loves, thus restoring the original reality. Rumpelstiltskin is last seen during the ending, imprisoned in a cage by Shrek, Fiona and the other ogres, while Fifi explodes at Fiona's high-note singing, Rumpelstilskin is also tormented by the Pied Piper who makes him dance in his cage.\n\nIn ''Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular'', Rumpelstiltskin is still imprisoned in a cage and receives coal for Christmas. He appears twice in ''Shrek's Yule Log'', out of his cage and unsuccessfully trying to put out the fireplace.\n\nRumplestiltskin combines features of the previous three main villains: he is short and rules an empire with an iron fist, like Farquaad; he has magical powers to help others alter their fates, like the Fairy Godmother; and his life is ruined by Shrek's rescue of Fiona from the castle keep, like Prince Charming. It is ultimately implied by Donkey, when he is folding Shrek's contract into origami, that the original way to break Rumpelstilskin's contract was to say his name, which no longer works because by this point in time everyone already knows who he is.\n\n===Jack and Jill===\n'''[[Jack and Jill (nursery rhyme)|Jack and Jill]]''' (voiced by [[Billy Bob Thornton]] and [[Amy Sedaris]]) are a married couple.\n\nIn ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]'', Jack and Jill are in the possession of the magic beans from the [[Jack and the Beanstalk]] story, which Puss, Kitty Softpaws and Humpty Dumpty manage to steal to get into the giant's keep. However, it is revealed later that Jack and Jill were in cahoots with Humpty and Kitty to take the Golden Goose and trick Puss into being imprisoned in his home town. But when the Great Terror arrives to retrieve Golden Goose, its baby, Jack and Jill try to steal the Goose when Humpty had a change of heart and tried to help Puss lure the Great Terror away from San Ricardo, only for the couple to be stomped on by the Terror. During the credits, Jack and Jill are seen in full body casts.\n\nThroughout the film, Jack tries convincing Jill that they should start a family, but after Jill's persistent refusal of having a baby, he happily compromises with Jill in assuming the role of taking care of their piglets, both especially showing a particular fondness for one piglet named \"Hamhock\".\n\nIn ''[[Shrek 2]]'', a thinner Jill is one of three women shown ogling a newly human Shrek, mentioning Jack as having gone to fetch a pail of water, not recognising Puss in Boots.\n\n==Minor villains==\n\n===Thelonious===\n'''Thelonious''' (voiced by [[Christopher Knights]]) appears as one of Lord Farquaad's henchmen and possibly the executioner, as he's the one who tortures Gingy by breaking his legs and melting him in the milk and threatens the Magic Mirror by suggesting Lord Farquaad to break it. His face is always covered by the hood, but he also wears really tight costume that emphasizes the size of his muscles and crotch. He has poor intelligence, as shown when Lord Farquaad is deciding between three princesses and Thelonious says \"Three! Pick number three, my lord\" while holding up two fingers. He's later seen at Fiona and Farquaad's wedding and it is possible that he isn't really a villain, because when they kiss, he wrote \"Aawww\" on one of the signs that are telling people how should they react to different situations. He's also seen in the ending, at Shrek and Fiona's wedding, when he helps to play the music organ. He also makes a cameo appearance in ''Shrek Forever After'', but only during the credits (showing a slide show of clips from the last 3 ''Shrek'' films).\n\nHe also appears in [[Shrek 4-D]], where he kidnaps Fiona so the spirit of Farquaad can kill her and make her his spirit queen. But when Thelonious released the raft to send Fiona over a waterfall, he forgot to get off of it first. He accepted Fiona punching his face multiple times. When she finds her punches doesn't hurt him, she kicks Thelonious hard between his legs by stepping on the wooden beam of the raft. After he  collapsed in pain and fell overboard, she apologized to him. Then he fell from the waterfall but grabbed onto a branch. When Fiona, Shrek and Donkey fell from the waterfall as well, he proved he is good, because he caught them all in one hand while still held the branch by the othe until the branch broke. They all fell down the waterfall, but the Dragon rescued all of them and kills Lord Farquaad for good. Thelonious becomes the first ''Shrek'' films villain to change to good.\n\n===Rapunzel===\n'''[[Rapunzel]]''' (voiced by [[Maya Rudolph]]) is one of Princess Fiona's former friends. She is snobbish, opinionated, vain, and does not seem to get along with the bossy Snow White.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', Rapunzel is first seen during Fiona's baby shower, until Prince Charming invades the castle and the princesses, Doris and Queen Lillian escape secretly. Rapunzel pretends to find an exit and runs all the way to where Charming really is. The princesses, Doris and Lillian follow but are cornered by Charming's knights. Rapunzel then betrays them and shows off her love and affection for the Prince, while the other women are imprisoned in a dungeon with Rapunzel telling Prince Charming not to have any harm come to them. While they are there, Rapunzel practices for her role in Prince Charming's play. In the final performance, she sings and acts as a princess on top of a tower (mimicking Princess Fiona, whose situation itself mimics Rapunzel's). The play is interrupted by Shrek's friends and Fiona. Gingy comes on stage by holding on to Rapunzel's hair, which he accidentally pulls off. When it is revealed that she is actually bald, Rapunzel gasps in horror and runs from the stage out of embarrassment.\n\n===Captain Hook===\n'''[[Captain Hook]]''' (voiced by [[Ian McShane]] in the third movie) appears in ''Shrek 2'' in the bar of the Poison Apple, where he plays the piano and sings \"Little Drop of Poison\" (his singing voice during that song was provided by [[Tom Waits]]) and \"People Just Ain't No Good\" (his singing voice during that song was provided by [[Nick Cave]]) in the other. He appears in ''Shrek the Third'', working for Prince Charming. When Artie convinces the villains to give up evil, Hook states that he grows daffodils and they are beautiful. Captain Hook is the first who throws his weapon down and becomes good.\n\nCaptain Hook also appears as a contestant in the ''Far Far Away Idol'' feature on the ''Shrek 2'' DVD with his singing voice provided by [[Matt Mahaffey]]. He begins to sing \"[[Hooked On A Feeling]]\" until Tinkerbell (whom Hook poisons in the classic Peter Pan story) prompts [[Simon Cowell]] to remove him from the stage.\n\nCaptain Hook does not appear in ''Shrek Forever After'', but his voice is heard in the soundtrack, and he makes a cameo in the book opening of the film holding some daffodils.\n\n===Cyclops===\nThe '''[[Cyclops]]''' (voiced by [[Mark Valley]]) is the [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] for the Poison Apple as seen in ''[[Shrek 2]]''.\n\nHe appears in ''[[Shrek Super Slam]]'', and his slam is \"Eye in the Sky\".\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', the Cyclops is seen on a Bucking Bronco at the Poison Apple Bar when Prince Charming comes in. The Cyclops is among the villains that help Prince Charming take over Far Far Away. He has a daughter, a cute little cyclops girl who also has only one eye who he brings with him as part of \"Take Your Daughter to Work Day.\" He is a family man and does not really want to be evil. He even apologizes to Shrek when he hits him too hard. His idea of \"pillaging\" during the attack on Far, Far Away isn't exactly the most evil either, as he is only seen ripping the stamps off the letters in a mailbox.\n\nVarious Cyclopes like him appear in the ''Shrek the Third'' video game, but it is unknown if he is there or not.\n\n===Mabel the Ugly Stepsister===\n'''Mabel''' (voiced by [[Regis Philbin]]) is the sister of Doris and the [[Ugly sisters|stepsister of Cinderella]]. She first appears in ''Shrek the Third'', where she assists Prince Charming in his plan to take over Far Far Away. She is chubby and wears green-themed clothes. Like Doris, she is a kind-hearted person.\n\nMabel is first seen when, at the bar of the Poison Apple, Prince Charming asks her where Doris is. Mabel, who has taken Doris's place as [[bartender]], replies \"She's not welcome here.\" (In fact, Doris is now friends with Shrek and Princess Fiona). Like Doris, Mabel has a crush on Prince Charming. At the film's climax, she meets Doris on stage after the tower prop falls on Prince Charming and they reconcile.\n\nMabel appears two times in ''Shrek Forever After'', first time at the ogre triplets' birthday party where she tells Shrek that he forgot the candles for the birthday cake and second time where she grew old as one of the viewers of Rumpelstiltskin's message in the alternate reality.\n\n===The Evil Gnomes===\nThe '''Evil [[Gnome]]''' are gnomes who wear dark clothes and sport black beards. They appeared briefly in the second film and more prominent in the third.\n\nIn ''Shrek 2'', two Evil Gnomes are shown wrestling with each other.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', the Evil Gnomes help Prince Charming in his plot to take over Far Far Away.\n\n===The Evil Trees===\nThe '''Evil Trees''' are a group of mobile wicked trees. Appearing briefly in the second film and more prominently in the third. In ''Shrek 2'' the two Evil Trees has been seen doing \"[[Arm wrestling|branch wrestling]]\" while one breaks the branch of the other. In ''Shrek the Third'' the two '''Evil [[Tree]]s''' (played by Andrew Birch and [[Christopher Knights]]) help Prince Charming in his plot to take over Far Far Away. In one scene of the third film, their names are revealed to be Ed and Steve. In the same scene, they explain that it is hard to find work since most of the world is against them. The other Evil Trees are dropped into Far Far Away during the Evil Witches' air raid.\n\nThe trees are possibly two of the living trees from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]''.\n\nThe evil trees appear in the ''[[Shrek Forever After (video game)|Shrek Forever After]]'' video game.\n\n===The Evil Queen===\nThe '''[[Queen (Snow White)|Evil Queen]]''' (voiced by [[Susanne Blakeslee|Susan Blakeslee]]) appears in the third Shrek film where she assists Prince Charming in taking over Far Far Away when Prince Charming visits the Poison Apple bar. Prince Charming refers to her as the \"Wicked Witch.\" When she is about to kill Queen Lillian (with a sword to her neck), Artie asserts they all can all stop being evil if they are willing to make a better choice. The Evil Queen happily says that she always wants to open a spa in France.\n\n===The Puppet Master===\n'''The Puppet Master''' (voiced by [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]]) appears in ''Shrek the Third'' where Prince Charming convinces him to join his brigade by describing how Pinocchio has gone to look for his \"real\" father and never writes. His only line is \"I hate that little wooden puppet\".\n\nHe is loosely based on [[Mangiafuoco]] in the [[Carlo Collodi]]'s book ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' and more based on Stromboli in the [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Disney film]] (bearing that name in the video game).\n\n===Headless Horseman===\n'''[[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|Headless Horseman]]''' (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]]) makes a cameo appearance in the Poisoned Apple during the second film and appears in the third film with Prince Charming in his invasion of villains. He seems to be a good friend of Captain Hook. He reveals that he has \"always wanted to play the flute\" (which would be difficult at best since he has no head).\n\n===Fifi===\n'''Fifi''' is Rumpelstiltskin's giant pet [[goose]]. He is also his bodyguard and carriage puller and attacks Shrek and Donkey at one point. During the ending credits, Fiona sings a high note, causing Fifi to explode alongside the bluebird, a homage to a scene from the first movie.\n\nFifi does not appear in ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]'', but The Great Terror looks a lot like him.\n\n===Witches===\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', some '''[[Witchcraft|Witches]]''' are shown as patrons at the bar of the Poison Apple (one of them was seen singing at the Poison Apple Bar) when Prince Charming rallies the fairytale villains to take over Far Far Away. The witches carry out an air raid, dropping the evil trees from there to attack the citizens.\n\nSome witches are among Rumpelstiltskin's main assistants in ''Shrek Forever After'', wearing black coats and having long noses and greenish faces. They ride their broomsticks and use pumpkins as bombs. They can be killed by water, as Rumpelstiltskin does to one of them, who cries \"Oh, what a world! What a world!\", like the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. Some of them are seen dancing modern hip hop moves to the Pied Piper's flute after they ridicule him. They are defeated in the final battle. Although most of them display vicious behavior for most of the film, they passively surrender once Rumpelstiltskin is captured and are even shown to be sorry for Fiona when Shrek disappears. Near the end, they have reformed and made a [[rainbow]] out of clouds. Baba and Griselda are the only witches whose names are mentioned.\n\nThe witches in ''Shrek Forever After'' are voiced by [[Billie Hayes]], [[Kristen Schaal]], [[Mary Kay Place]], [[Meredith Vieira]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Mike Mitchell (director)|Mike Mitchell]] and [[Lake Bell]].\n\n===Monsieur Robin Hood===\n'''\"Monsieur [[Robin Hood]]\"''' (voiced by [[Vincent Cassel]]) is a French-accented version of [[Robin Hood]] who appears in the first Shrek film. Believing that Shrek had kidnapped Princess Fiona, he and his Merry Men burst upon them and introduce themselves with an [[accordion]]-backed song and dance number describing how he intends to save Fiona and slay Shrek. She finds his song very \"annoying\" and cuts him off by knocking him to the ground, then defeats his entire band with her kung-fu skills, greatly impressing Shrek. Robin is portrayed as more of a confused nuisance than a threatening villain, as he genuinely believed that Shrek was going to harm Fiona. He and the Merry Men attend Shrek and Fiona's wedding, indicating that there was no real malice.\n\nRobin Hood and his Merry Men appear in ''[[Shrek SuperSlam|Shrek Super Slam]]'' as unlockable characters. They also appear in the Swamp Karaoke Dance Party in the end of the film, joining with Shrek, Princess Fiona, Donkey, Snow White, Pinocchio, Thelonious, Papa Bear, Cinderella, the Big Bad Wolf, and others for a huge dance (they sing \"[[Y.M.C.A. (song)|Y.M.C.A.]]\").\n\n===Sir Lancelot===\n'''Sir [[Lancelot]]''' (voiced by [[John Krasinski]]) is one of Arthur's classmates in high school. The captain of the school's [[jousting]] team. He's got thick black hair and square jaw. He's very handsome, well-built and sexy, but also really rude, arrogant and narcissistic. He is the quintessential Big Man on Campus and a typical jock \u2014 he loves sport, he has got many fans and he tends to abuse his popularity. Lancelot is portrayed as more of a bully than a threatening villain. He takes every opportunity to assert his superiority over his classmates, whether through a sarcastic comeback or a beating on the jousting field. The main recipient of such thrashings is Artie, because Lancelot is much more muscular, handsome and stronger than him. He wins with him during jousting, so Shrek mistakes him for Artie, which doesn't look like a king. He is possibly Guinevere's boyfriend.\n\n===The Black Knight===\nThe [[gibberish]]-speaking '''[[Black knight|Black Knight]]''' (voiced by [[Max Koch]]) appears in black armor and a red cape in ''[[Shrek SuperSlam|Shrek Super Slam]]''. He is available as a standard character and his slam is the \"Seismic Smash\".\n\nIn \"Shrek the Third,\" there were some black knights that helped Prince Charming in a plot to kill Shrek\n\n===The Pied Piper===\nThe '''[[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]]''' appears briefly in the first film, among the fairy tale creatures exiled in Shrek's swamp, where he rallies many rats with his enchanted flute.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', he is hired by [[#Rumpelstiltskin|Rumpelstiltskin]] to capture the ogres by forcing them to dance and follow him with his enchanted flute. He can handle different species (rats, ogres, witches...) or even objects (Rumpelstiltskin's socks) by setting the \"target\" dial of his flute. He never speaks, only using his flute to communicate. The Piper has no real voice, but the flute performance was done by [[Jeremy Steig]] (original author [[William Steig]]'s son).\n\nIn ''Shrek Forever After'' he is seen playing two pop culture songs: at first he plays [[Sure Shot]], to make the witches dance after their mockery of him, and later he plays [[Shake Your Groove Thing]], in order to make the ogres dance directly to Rumpelstiltskin's castle\n\n===Raoul===\n'''Raoul''' (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]]) appears in ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]''. He is a hairy thief and thug. He has got some tattoos: three beans on his arm, beanstalk reaching the castle in the sky on his chest, golden goose on his back and golden eggs probably on his genitals (when he offered Puss to show that tattoo, he unzipped his trousers).\n\nHe is firstly seen in the bar where he is drinking and laughing at the cat along with the other thieves. He tells Puss the story about the Golden Goose and Jack and Jill and illustrates his tale by taking off his shirt and revealing his tattoos. He also tries to rob him, but then Puss cuts off half of his beard.\n\nLater, we can see that he was in cahoots with Humpty to take the Golden Goose and trick Puss into being imprisoned in his home town. After the Giant Terror went down to take the Golden Goose back, he is bathing and playing the rubber duck. The tattoos on his body makes the Giant Terror angry and she throws the bathtub where he was bathing into the air. It is unknown did he died or survived.\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===Magic Mirror===\nThe '''[[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]]''' (voiced by [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]]) is a mirror with a live spirit communicating through it, and with magical displaying abilities.\n\nIt is first brought to [[#Lord Farquaad|Lord Farquaad]] who asks it if Duloc is not the most perfect kingdom, exactly the same way the Evil Queen used to ask it if she was not the fairest of all. The magic mirror explains that Lord Farquaad is not from a royal family so he cannot be king unless he marries a princess. It then presents Lord Farquaad with three princesses that he can marry: Cinderella, Snow White, and Princess Fiona, in which he chooses Fiona. However, the mirror also tries to warn Farquaad about Fiona's curse, but is ignored. Farquaad later uses it to constantly review the image of Fiona, in which it is now constantly worried.\n\nIt is later seen to be with Shrek's posse, who in ''[[Shrek 2]]'' use it as a [[television set]] such as announcing that the show will be back after commercials.\n\nIn ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'', [[#Rumpelstiltskin|Rumpelstiltskin]] has it and uses it on television broadcasting purposes. In the ending, he is seen shining a light on a giant disco ball.\n\n===The Muffin Man===\n'''[[The Muffin Man|Jero the Muffin Man]]''' (voiced by [[Conrad Vernon]]) is a [[baker]] who lives in Far Far Away.\n\nHe is mentioned briefly in the first ''Shrek'' film when Gingy and Lord Farquaad discuss their knowledge of him, speaking in the words of the nursery rhyme.\n\n{{anchor|Mongo}} He first appears in ''Shrek 2'', when Shrek and Gingy persuade him to bake an enormous gingerbread man named Mongo. Mongo helps the heroes to storm King Harold's castle during the Wedding Ball.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', the Muffin Man is revealed to be a father figure to Gingy, who calls him \"Papa\". As in the nursery rhyme, he lives on Drury Lane.\n\nHe appears in ''Shrek Forever After'' as a baker on birthday party. In the reality in which Shrek wasn't born, Gingy is seen fighting Animal Crackers and the Muffin Man is seen as a [[Bookmaker|bookie]] saying \"Place your bets!\" He also appears in the scene when Rumplestiltskin promises anyone's heart's desire if they give him Shrek.\n\n===Furniture===\nThe '''Furniture''' that are in Fiona's bedroom first appeared in ''Shrek 2''. They are brought to life by Fairy Godmother's magic to sing and dance with her and provide Fiona with the needs of being a princess but to Fairy Godmother and their surprise, she didn't need the requirements and are more shocked to learn that she's married to an ogre named Shrek. Later, they temporally come back to life and (under Fairy Godmother's orders) block the exits to prevent Shrek from escaping Fiona's room. Afterwards, they no longer speak or move.\n\nThey return in ''Shrek 3'', but are no longer alive (presumably due to Fairy Godmother's death); however, they still play a specific role in the film.\n\n===Guinevere===\n'''[[Guinevere]]''' (voiced by [[Latifa Ouaou]]) is a love interest of Arthur's. When he reveals this, she replies with \"ew\". She's possibly Lancelot's girlfriend. She chews bubble gum.\n\n===Imelda===\n'''Imelda''' (voiced by [[Constance Marie]]) was Puss' surrogate mother who appears in ''Puss in  Boots''.\n\n===Golden Goose===\nThe '''[[Golden Goose]]''' in ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]'' looks more like a giant gosling even being titled as the golden goose and even when she's too young, she lays solid [[The Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs|golden eggs]] and is determined to fly as she flaps her wings.\n\n===Great Terror===\nEven being called so, the '''Great Terror''' is a giant [[Chen (genus)|white goose]] with golden wing [[feather]]s. She is also the mother of the Golden Goose who used to be owned by Giants.\n\nShe is very similar to Fifi from ''[[Shrek Forever After]]''.\n\n===Suzie===\n'''Suzie''' (voiced by [[Susan Fitzer]]) was a gingerbread girl and Gingy's girlfriend that appears briefly in Gingy's flashbacks in the third film and also in Gingy's flashback story in ''[[Shrek the Halls]]''. In ''Shrek the Third'', she has been seen kissing with Gingy in a car at a [[Drive-in theater|drive-in cinema]]. In ''Shrek the Halls'' in Gingy's Christmas story, he recounts a Christmas winter night he spent with her. The two were in a car made of bread and candies parked on a table, which made them seem like cookies left out for Santa Claus, who later tries to eat them. The gingerbread couple attempted to run, but Suzy was caught by Santa, and she was eaten after letting out a scream. Her death was shown to be the cause of Gingy's fear of Santa.\n\n===Sugar===\n'''Sugar''' (voiced by [[Kristen Schaal]]) is a gingerbread girl made up as Gingy's love interest in Gingy's (fictional) story \"The Bride of Gingy.\" in ''[[Scared Shrekless]]''. She became Gingy's girlfriend when Gingy explains to the Muffin Man that his other girlfriend kicked him out because he only cared about himself. To that, he makes Gingy a new girlfriend. Gingy thought of adding lots of sugar to the gingerbread batter to make his girlfriend really sweet, despite the Muffin Man's objections. Once Sugar is born, she falls in love with Gingy. At first, Gingy is overjoyed, but gets uncomfortable with Sugar becoming overly attached to him. He finally escapes and gets over it by knocking her into the mixer which created thousands of zombie [[cloning|clones]] of herself that attacked Gingy and ate him.\n\n===Other characters===\n\n====[[Cyclops]] Girl====\nShe is Cyclops's beautiful little daughter who appears briefly in ''Shrek the Third'' and loves her father. Her father brings his sweet little cyclops to work on \"Bring Your Kids To Work Day\", where Shrek is surprised to see her, but then gives the little cyclops a rub on the head and a compliment, telling her dad \"She's got your eye\".\n\n====[[Hansel and Gretel]]====\nHansel and Gretel appear in the second film's royal ball, walking on the red carpet and happy about Fiona's wedding. They appear to throw bread on the ground, puzzling the [[Joan Rivers]]-like commentator at the ball. They are also mentioned by the Fairy Godmother while she finds that ogres don't live happily ever after.\n\n====[[Little Boy Blue]]====\nHe grew up alongside Puss in Boots and Humpty Dumpty in the San Ricardo Orphanage and bullied the latter. His [[methemoglobinemia|skin is blue]].\n\nHe looks very similar to Butter Pants from [[Shrek Forever After]].\n\n====[[Little Red Riding Hood]]====\nLittle Red Riding Hood is shown at the beginning of ''Shrek 2'', coming to the gingerbread and cake house (from [[Hansel and Gretel]]) and running away leaving her basket behind after seeing Shrek and Fiona as ogres.\n\nShe also appears in [[Shrek 2 (video game)|''Shrek 2'' the game]] being voiced by [[Tara Strong]], and as a professional [[softball]] pitcher. Her slam is Basket of Utter Destruction. She has a different appearance in the two productions.\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', Little Red Riding Hood was seen pickpocketing someone. She appears as a racer in the game ''[[Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing]]''. Her name in it is simply \"Red Riding Hood\", but her appearance is the same as in ''Shrek 2''. Her kart is the Big Bad Wolf, and her personal item is a picnic basket.\n\n====[[Mister Geppetto]]====\nMr. Geppetto (voiced by [[Chris Miller (animator)|Chris Miller]] in ''Shrek'' and ''Shrek Forever After'' and by Sean Bishop in ''Scared Shrekless'') is [[Pinocchio]]'s father. He is seen selling Pinocchio to Farquaad's army in the first film.\n\nIn ''Shrek Forever After'' Pinocchio tries to pass him off to Rumpelstiltskin as Shrek.\n\n====Miss [[Toad]]====\nMiss Toad (voiced by Wendy Bilanski) is seen at the Poison Apple Bar in the second film. She could be the toad that kidnapped [[Thumbelina]].\n\n====[[Seven Dwarfs]]====\n[[Snow White]]'s seven [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarves]] appear in the first film carrying Snow White's coffin. When the place the coffin on the table, Shrek says \"Oh no! Dead broad off the table.\" One of the Dwarfs says \"Where else are we supposed to put it? The bed's already been taken\" as Shrek finds the Big Bad Wolf in his bed.\n\nThey are seen again in ''Shrek 2'', when they give Shrek a ring engraved with \"I love you\" in flaming letters for Fiona (in an allusion to the [[One Ring]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''). In \"Shrek the Third\", one of them (Grumpy) is given to Fiona at her baby shower (as a [[babysitter]]) from Snow White who says she has six more at home. He is later seen again after the birth to babysit, only to be turned away by Shrek. They are seen at the end of ''Scared Shrekless'' when Shrek and Fiona celebrate by egging them. They have been voiced by various actors including [[Elisa Gabrielli]], David P. Smith, [[Walt Dohrn]], and Sean Bishop. In Shrek The Musical, it is revealed that Grumpy was the father of Lord Farquaad who kicked him out of his house because he was 28 and living in his basement.\n\n====[[The Little Mermaid]]====\nA [[mermaid]] resembling [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] from the Disney film ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' makes a cameo appearance during the \"[[Accidentally in Love]]\" scene in ''Shrek 2'', when Shrek and Fiona are on the beach during their honeymoon. A wave comes in and then goes back out, leaving her on top of Shrek, kissing him. Fiona throws her back into the sea, where she is eaten by sharks (though it is not certain whether she is eaten by sharks or merely attacked).\n\n====[[There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe|The Old Lady in the Shoe]]====\nHer house is seen when Lord Farquaad consigns all the fairytale characters to Shrek's swamp. She was under the shoe with her children.\n\n====[[Peter Pan]]====\nPeter Pan (voiced by Michael Galasso) is seen in the first film waiting in line to sell Tinkerbell. His only line in the film is \"He can fly!\" (delivered when Tinkerbell inadvertently sprinkles fairy dust on Donkey).\n\nIn ''Shrek the Third'', Captain Hook mistakes a small boy in Far Far Away for Peter Pan where he quotes to his mother \"Shut it Wendy\" thinking that she is Wendy. Peter Pan is also a character in ''[[Shrek The Musical]]'', that is banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[Tinker Bell]]====\nTinker Bell is almost sold by [[Peter Pan]] in the first film, and it is her \"fairy dust\" that allows Donkey to fly temporarily. In ''Shrek 2'' she dances with Gingy during the ''Far Far Away Idol'' and is jarred and used as lighting for a mud bath with 17 other fairies. Things then become worse for the fairies, as Shrek and Fiona are then farting in the mud, which the fairies wave away. She uses her magic to turn Puss's boots into dancing ones during the ''Far Far Away Idols''. She is also a player in ''Shrek 2 the video game'', helping to rescue Shrek, Donkey, Puss, Little Red Riding Hood, the Big Bad Wolf and the Gingerbread Man.\n\nIn the game ''[[Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing]]'', she makes a cameo in the Potion Factory Exterior Track. She is the purple fairy that flies across the track, and if any character hits her, they will spin out.\n\n====[[The Story of the Three Bears|The Three Bears]]====\nPapa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear (voiced by [[Bobby Block]]) appear in the first film among the fairytale characters captured by Lord Farquaad's troops as Baby Bear tells his parents \"This cage is too small.\" They are among the fairy tale character that are sent to Shrek's swamp, and in the party at the end of the film. In ''Shrek Smash n' Crash Racing'', Papa Bear is used as a kart for Goldilocks, but is not a playable character.\n\nIn ''Shrek Superslam'', there is a bearskin rug (most likely Mama Bear, as there was a bow on her head) in one of the secret arenas. They also appear in ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'', and are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[Tom Thumb]] and [[Thumbelina]]====\nTom Thumb and Thumbelina walk together on the red carpet at Fiona and Shrek's wedding ball. They are both ignominiously swept up with the debris cluttering the red carpet, and they fail to attend the ball. Tom Thumb pushes Thumbelina in front of him as they are swept up.\n\n====[[Captain of the Guard]]s====\nThe Captain of the Guard (voiced by [[Jim Cummings]] in ''Shrek'' and [[Andrew Adamson]] in ''Shrek 2'') first appears in the first film  as the commander of Farquaad's army and his personal aide. A similar character reappears in Shrek 2 but is now the head of King Harold's army.\n\n====[[Quasimodo]]====\nQuasimodo (voiced by [[Nolan North]]) appears in ''[[Shrek SuperSlam]]'' where he moves in next door to Shrek's swamp. He plays his bells at 4:00 AM while Shrek and Fiona are trying to sleep. When he won't stop playing his bells, this leads to Shrek and Fiona fighting him.\n\n===Appearing in Shrek the Musical===\nThe following characters appear in ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'':\n\n====Shrek's parents====\nShrek's ogre parents appear at the beginning of the musical. They send Shrek out of their home at his seventh birthday, for him to live by himself.\n\nShrek's father was mentioned in ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' when Shrek talks with Artie about their fathers, according to Shrek in that scene, his father tried to [[Cannibalism|eat him]].\n\nIt is unknown what their fates are as they never appear in the films.\n\n====[[Fairy godmother|Fairy Godmother]]====\nA Fairy Godmother different from the one seen in ''Shrek 2'' appears in ''Shrek the Musical'' and is banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[Gnome]]====\nA Gnome appears in the Seattle Try-out & Broadway Line-Up of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[The Hatter|Mad Hatter]]====\nThe Mad Hatter appears in the West End Line-Up version of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale character that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[Shoemaking|Shoemaker]]'s [[Elf]]====\nBased on one of the elves from ''[[The Elves and the Shoemaker]]'', it appears in the Seattle Try-out & Broadway Line-Up and US National Tour Line-Up versions of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====Sugarplum [[Fairy]]====\nBased on the Sugarplum Fairies from ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', the Sugarplum Fairy appears in all three versions of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[The Ugly Duckling]]====\nThe Ugly Duckling appeared in all three versions of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]]====\nTweedledum and Tweedledee appear in the West End Line-Up version of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====[[White Rabbit]]====\nThe White Rabbit appeared in the Seattle Try-out & Broadway Line-Up and West End Line-Up versions of ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' amongst the fairy tale characters that are banished to Shrek's swamp.\n\n====The Cow Who Jumped Over the Moon====\nThe Cow Who Jumped Over the Moon appears in the Travel Song where she jumps over the moon as Shrek and Donkey walk on their way to rescue Fiona.\n\nThe character is mentioned in \"The Pig Who Cried Werewolf\" when The Three Little Pigs remember when Heimlich claimed that he has seen an OVNI, but Dieter says that was just the Cow who jumped over the moon\n\n====The Dish and the Spoon====\nThe Dish and the Spoon appear in the Travel Song where they run away as Shrek and Donkey walk on their way to rescue Fiona. The Dish and the Spoon are having a conversation and somehow being pursued by the police, it is unknown if they escaped or got arrested.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n{{cleanup|section|reason=This

Despite this, the language has never fallen completely out of use, with a minority having some knowledge of it; in addition, Manx still has a role as an important part of the island's culture and heritage. Manx has been the subject of [[language revival]] efforts; in 2015, around 1,800 people had varying levels of [[second language]] conversational ability. Since the late 20th century, Manx has become more visible on the island, with increased signage, radio broadcasts and a Manx-medium primary school. The revival of Manx has been made easier because the language was well recorded: for example, the Bible had been translated into Manx, and audio recordings had been made of native speakers.\n\n==Names of the language==\n\n===In Manx===\nIn Manx, the language is called ''Gaelg'' or ''Gailck'' (pronounced \"gilk\" or \"gilg\" or \"gelg\" with hard Gs), a word which shares the same etymology as the word \"Gaelic\". The sister languages of [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] use ''Gaeilge'' (dialect variants Gaoluinn, Gaedhlag, Gaelge and Gaelic) and ''G\u00e0idhlig'', respectively, for their languages. As with Irish and Scottish, the form with the [[definite article]] is frequently used in Manx, e.g. ''y Ghaelg'' or ''y Ghailck'' (Irish ''an Ghaeilge'', Scottish ''a' Gh\u00e0idhlig'').\n\nTo distinguish it from the two other forms of Gaelic, the phrases ''Gaelg''/''Gailck Vannin'' (Gaelic of [[Isle of Man|Mann]]) and ''Gaelg''/''Gailck Vanninnagh'' (Manx Gaelic) also are used. In addition, the nickname \"\u00c7hengey ny Mayrey\" (the mother tongue/tongue of the mother, lit. the mother's tongue) is occasionally used.\n\n===In English===\nThe language is usually referred to in English as \"Manx\". The term \"Manx Gaelic\" is often used, for example when discussing the relationship between the three Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx) or to avoid confusion with [[Manx English|Anglo-Manx]], the form of English spoken on the island. Scottish Gaelic is often referred to in English as simply \"Gaelic\", but this is less common with Manx and Irish.\n\nA feature of Anglo-Manx deriving from Gaelic<!--- not really a calque---> is the use of the definite article, e.g. \"the Manx\", \"the Gaelic\", in ways not generally seen in standard English.\n\nThe word \"Manx\" is frequently spelled \"Manks\" in historical sources, particularly those written by natives of the island; the word means \"Mannish\", and originates from the [[Old Norse]] ''Mannisk''. The name of the island, Man, is frequently spelled \"Mann\". It is sometimes accompanied by a footnote explaining that it is a two-syllable word, with the stress on the first syllable, \"MAN-en\". The island is named after the Irish god [[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir]], thus ''Ellan Vannin'' (Irish ''Oile\u00e1n Mhannan\u00e1in'') 'Mannan\u00e1n's Island'.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Clagh Ogham ec Thie Tashtee Vannin.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An [[ogham inscription]] on a stone in the [[Manx Museum]] written in Primitive Irish and which reads DOVAIDONA MAQI DROATA, \"Of Dovaido, son of Droata\"<ref>{{cite web |last=West |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew West (linguist) |url=http://babelstone.blogspot.ie/2011/06/ogham-stones-of-isle-of-man.html |title=The Ogham Stones of the Isle of Man |publisher=BabelStone |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111042420/http://babelstone.blogspot.ie/2011/06/ogham-stones-of-isle-of-man.html |archive-date=11 November 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>]]\n[[File:Illiam Dhone.JPG|right|thumb|200px|William Christian, better known as [[Illiam Dhone]] (Brown-haired William)]]\n[[File:Lag ny Keeilley, West slope of Cronk ny Arrey Laa - geograph.org.uk - 181312.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Lag ny Keeilley'' (''Hollow of the Church'') on [[Cronk ny Arrey Laa]] (Hill of the Day Watch). The Manx language has had a substantial influence on the island's [[toponymy]] and nomenclature.]]\n\nManx is a [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] language, closely related to [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]]. On the whole it is partially mutually intelligible with these, and native speakers of one find it easy to gain passive, and even spoken, competency in the other two.\n\nThe earliest known language of the Isle of Man was a form of [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] (like modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]], Cornish and Breton). However, the basis of the modern Manx language is [[Primitive Irish]] (like modern Irish and [[Scottish Gaelic]]). The island lends its name to ''[[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir|Manann\u00e1n]]'', the Brythonic and Gaelic sea god who is said in myth to have once ruled the island. Primitive Irish is first attested in [[Ogham]] inscriptions from the 4th century AD. These writings have been found throughout Ireland and the west coast of [[Great Britain]]. Primitive Irish transitioned into [[Old Irish]] through the 5th century. Old Irish, dating from the 6th century, used the [[Latin script]] and is attested primarily in [[marginalia]] to Latin manuscripts, but there are no extant examples from the Isle of Man.\n\nOn the Isle of Man, the transition from Manx Brythonic to Old Irish (or [[Manx Gaelic]]) may have been gradual and appears to have occurred after speakers of Primitive Irish [[History of the Isle of Man|settled on the Isle of Man]], in large numbers, from about the 5th century AD. Their influence is evident in a change of language in Ogham inscriptions on Man.\n\nIt is possible that Old Irish did not survive the conquest and domination of the island by [[Norse language|Norse]]-speaking Vikings, so that modern Manx language may represent a later, revived form (derived from [[Middle Irish]]). During the 8th century AD, the Isle of Man, like the people in coastal areas of Scotland and Ireland, was significantly influenced by Norse speakers. While Norse had very little impact on the Manx language overall,<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Language death in the Isle of Man : an investigation into the decline and extinction of Manx Gaelic as a community language in the Isle of Man|last=George.|first=Broderick|date=1999|publisher=Niemeyer|isbn=9783110911411|oclc=300505991}}</ref> its legacy in Manx includes loanwords, personal names, and place names such as [[Laxey]] (Laksaa) and [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] (Rhumsaa).\n\nBy the 10th century, Middle Irish had emerged and was spoken throughout Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man.\n\nDuring the later Middle Ages, the Isle of Man fell increasingly under the influence of England, and from then on the [[English language]] has been the chief external factor in the development of Manx. Beginning in 1405, Manx experienced even more English influence under the rule of Sir John Stanley. As contact between Manx speakers and Gaelic speakers from Scotland and Ireland declined, the language diverged further from its related neighbours.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn the 17th century, some university students left the Isle of Man to attend school in England. At the same time, teaching in English was required in schools founded by governor Isaac Barrow. Barrow also promoted the use of English in churches; he considered that it was a superior language for reading the Bible; however, because the majority of ministers were monolingual Manx speakers, his views had little practical impact.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThomas Wilson began his tenure as Bishop of Mann in 1698 and was succeeded by Mark Hildesley. Both men held positive views of Manx; Wilson was the first person to publish a book in Manx, a translation of ''The Principles and Duties of Christianity'' (''Coyrie Sodjey''), and Hildesley successfully promoted the use of Manx as the language of instruction in schools. The New Testament was first published in Manx in 1767.  In the late 18th century, nearly every school was teaching in English. This decline continued into the 19th century, as English gradually became the primary language spoken on the Isle of Man.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1848, J.&nbsp;G. Cumming wrote, \"there are ... few persons (perhaps none of the young) who speak no English.\" [[Henry Jenner]] estimated in 1874 that about 30% of the population habitually spoke Manx (12,340 out of a population of 41,084). According to official census figures, 9.1% of the population claimed to speak Manx in 1901; in 1921 the percentage was only 1.1%.<ref>Gunther 1990, 59\u201360</ref> Since the language was used by so few people, it had low linguistic \"[[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]]\", and parents tended to not teach Manx to their children, thinking it would be useless to them compared with English.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Revival==\nFollowing the decline in the use of Manx during the nineteenth century, {{lang|gv|[[Manx Gaelic Society|Yn \u00c7heshaght Ghailckagh]]}} (The Manx Language Society) was founded in 1899.  By the middle of the twentieth century, only a few elderly [[native speaker]]s remained (the last of them, [[Ned Maddrell]], died on 27 December 1974), but by then a scholarly revival had begun and a few people had started teaching it in schools.  The Manx Language Unit was formed in 1992, consisting of three members and headed by Manx Language Officer [[Brian Stowell]], a language enthusiast and fluent speaker, \"which was put in charge of all aspects of Manx language teaching and accreditation in schools.\"<ref name=\":1\">Ager, Simon. \"A Study of Language Death and Revival with a Particular Focus on Manx Gaelic.\" Master's Dissertation University of Wales, Lampeter, 2009.

The revival of Manx has been aided by the recording work done in the twentieth century by researchers. Most notably, the [[Irish Folklore Commission]] was sent in with recording equipment in 1948 by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]. Also important in preserving the Manx language was work conducted by the late Brian Stowell, who is considered personally responsible for the current revival of the Manx language.<ref name=graun /> The Manx Language Strategy was released in 2017, outlining a five-year plan for the language's continued revitalisation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.im/news/2017/dec/01/five-year-strategy-salutes-and-celebrates-manx-language/|title=Isle of Man Government - Five year strategy salutes and celebrates Manx language|website=www.gov.im|language=en-GB|access-date=6 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theworldweekly.com/reader/view/magazine/2018-01-04/lifelines-for-indigenous-languages/10437|title=Lifelines for indigenous languages {{!}} The World Weekly|website=www.theworldweekly.com|access-date=6 January 2018}}</ref> [[Culture Vannin]] employs a Manx Language Development Officer (Manx: ''Yn [[Greinneyder]]'') to encourage and facilitate the use of the language.\n\nIn 2009, [[UNESCO]]'s [[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]] declared Manx an [[extinct language]], despite the presence of hundreds of speakers on the Isle of Man.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/isle_of_man/7901763.stm |title=UN declares Manx Gaelic 'extinct' |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=20 February 2009 |website=[[bbc.co.uk]] |access-date=4 April 2015}}</ref> Since then, UNESCO's classification of the language has changed to \"critically endangered\".<ref name=graun>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/02/how-manx-language-came-back-from-dead-isle-of-man |title=How the Manx language came back from the dead |last1=Whitehead |first1=Sarah |date=2 April 2015 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=4 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2011 census, 1,823 out of 80,398 Isle of Man residents, or 2.27% of the population, claimed to have knowledge of Manx,<ref name=Gov.im>[http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/treasury/economic/census/census2011reportfinalresized.pdf Isle of Man Census Report 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108113021/http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/treasury/economic/census/census2011reportfinalresized.pdf |date=8 November 2012 }}.</ref> an increase of 134 people from the 2001 census.<ref>{{cite news|title=Manx Gaelic Revival 'Impressive'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/isle_of_man/4271840.stm|work=BBC News|date=22 September 2005}}</ref> These were spread roughly uniformly over the island: in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] 566 people professed an ability to speak, read or write Manx; 179 in [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]], 146 in [[Onchan]], and 149 in Ramsey.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nTraditional Manx given names are once again becoming common on the island, especially ''Moirrey'' and ''Voirrey'' (Mary, properly pronounced similarly to the Scottish ''Moira'', but often mispronounced as ''Moiree/Voiree'' when used as a given name by non-Manx speakers), ''Illiam'' ([[William (name)|William]]), ''Orry'' (from the Manx king [[Godred Crovan]] of Norse origin), ''Breeshey'' (also ''Breesha'') ([[Bridget (given name)|Bridget]]), ''Aalish'' (also ''Ealish'') ([[Alice (given name)|Alice]]), ''Juan'' ([[Jack (name)|Jack]]), ''Ean'' (Ian), ''Joney'' ([[John (name)|John]]), ''Fenella'' ([[Fionnuala]]), ''Pherick'' ([[Patrick (given name)|Patrick]]) and ''Freya'' (from the [[Freyja|Norse goddess]]) remain popular.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n== Number of speakers by year ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Year\n! colspan=2 | Manx speakers\n! rowspan=2 | Manx <br/>population\n|-\n!

By that time, any presumed literary link with Ireland and Scotland, such as through Irish-trained priests, had been lost. The first published literature in Manx was ''The Principles and Duties of Christianity (Coyrie Sodjey)'', translated by [[Bishop of Man]] [[Thomas Wilson (bishop)|Thomas Wilson]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe [[Book of Common Prayer]] was translated by [[John Philips (bishop)|John Phillips]], the Welsh-born [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] (1605\u201333). The early Manx script has some similarities with orthographical systems found occasionally in Scotland and in Ireland for the transliteration of Gaelic, such as the [[Book of the Dean of Lismore]], as well as some extensive texts based on English and Scottish English orthographical practices of the time. Little secular [[Manx literature]] has been preserved.\n\nThe New Testament was first published in 1767. When the [[Anglican church]] authorities started to produce written literature in the Manx language in the 18th century, the system developed by John Philips was further \"anglicised\"; the one feature retained from Welsh orthography was the use of {{angle bracket|y}} to represent [[schwa]] (e.g. {{lang|gv|cabbyl}} {{IPA|[ka\u02d0\u03b2\u0259l]}} \"horse\" and {{lang|gv|cooney}} {{IPA|[ku\u02d0n\u0259]}} \"help\" as well as {{IPA|/\u026a/}} (e.g. {{lang|gv|fys}} {{IPA|[f\u026az]}} \"knowledge\"), though it is also used to represent {{IPA|[j]}}, as in English (e.g. {{lang|gv|y Yuan}} {{IPA|[\u0259 ju\u02d0an]}} \"John\" (vocative), {{lang|gv|yeeast}} {{IPA|[ji\u02d0\u0259st]}} \"fish\").\n\nOther works produced in the 18th and 19th century include catechisms, hymn books and religious tracts. A translation of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was made in 1796.\n\nA considerable amount of secular literature has been produced in the 20th and 21st centuries as part of the language revival. In 2006, the first full-length novel in Manx, ''Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley'' (''The Vampire Murders'') was published by Brian Stowell, after being serialised in the press. There is an increasing amount of literature available in the language, and recent publications include Manx versions of the ''Gruffalo'' and ''Gruffalo's Child''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturevannin.im/cms/publication_type_index_1475.html |title=Books - Lioaryn &#124; Culture Vannin &#124; Isle of Man |website=Culturevannin.im |accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 [[Rob Teare]] translated [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s ''[[The Little Prince]]'' into Manx.<ref>[https://petit-prince-collection.com/lang/show_livre.php?lang=en&id=5326 Little Prince nr.

All other road signs are in English only.\n\nBusiness signage in Manx is gradually being introduced but is not mandated by law; however, the 1985 Tynwald Report on the use of Manx states that signage should be bilingual except where a Manx phrase is the norm.\n\n===The Manx Bible===\n:''In the time of Bishop Wilson it had been a constant source of complaint among the Manx clergy that they were the only church in Christendom that had no version of the Bible in the vulgar tongue. Wilson set to work to remedy the defect, and, with the assistance of some of his clergy, managed to get some of the Bible translated, and the Gospel of St. Matthew printed. Bishop Hildesley, his successor, with the help of the whole body of Manx clergy, completed the work, and in 1775 the whole Bible was printed.''<ref name=\"isle-of-man.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/history/manks/jenner.htm |title=Henry Jenner - The Manx Language, 1875 |publisher=Isle-of-man.com |accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Bible was first produced in Manx by a group of Anglican clergymen on the island. The Gospel of Matthew was printed in 1748. The four Gospels were produced in 1763 and ''Conaant Noa nyn Jiarn as Saualtagh Yeesey Creest'' (the [[New Testament]] of our Lord & Saviour Jesus Christ) in 1767 by the [[Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge]] (SPCK). In 1772 the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew and printed, together with the Books of [[Wisdom of Solomon]] and [[Ecclesiasticus]] (Sirach) from the [[Apocrypha]]. ''Yn Vible Casherick'' (The Holy Bible) of the Old and New Testaments was published as one book by the SPCK in 1775. The bicentenary was celebrated on the Isle of Man in 1975 and included a set of stamps from the Isle of Man Post Office.\n\nThis 1775 edition effectively fixed the modern orthography of Manx Gaelic, which has changed little since. Jenner claims that some [[bowdlerisation]] had occurred in the translation, e.g. the occupation of [[Rahab]] the prostitute is rendered as ''ben-oast'',{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} a hostess or female inn-keeper.<ref name=\"isle-of-man.com\"/>\n\nThere was a translation of the ''Psalmyn Ghavid'' (Psalms of David) in metre in Manx by the Rev John Clague, vicar of Rushen, which was printed with the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of 1768. Bishop Hildesley required that these [[Metrical Psalms]] were to be sung in churches. These were reprinted by the [[Manx Language Society]] in 1905.\n\nThe [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (BFBS) published the Conaant Noa (New Testament) in 1810 and reprinted it in 1824. ''Yn Vible Casherick'' (the Holy Bible) of the Old Testament and New Testament (without the two books of the Apocrypha) was first printed as a whole in 1819. BFBS last printed anything on paper in Manx in 1936 when it reprinted ''Noo Ean'' (the Gospel of St John); this was reprinted by [[Manx Gaelic Society|Yn \u00c7heshaght Ghailckagh]] (The Manx Gaelic Society) in 1968. The Manx Bible was republished by Shearwater Press in July 1979 as ''Bible Chasherick yn Lught Thie'' (Manx Family Bible), which was a reproduction of the BFBS 1819 Bible.\n\nSince 2014 the BFBS 1936 Manx Gospel of John has been available online on YouVersion and Bibles.org.\n\n===Church===\nManx was used in some churches into the late 19th century.<ref name=\"isle-of-man.com\"/> Although church services in Manx were once fairly common, they occur infrequently now. Yn \u00c7heshaght Ghailckagh, the Manx Language Society, hold an annual [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY9VF_bkZsw Christmas service] at locations around the island.\n\n==Classification and dialects==\nManx is one of the three descendants of [[Old Irish]] (via [[Middle Irish]] and early Modern Gaelic), and is closely related to [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]]. It shares a number of developments in phonology, vocabulary and grammar with Irish and Scottish Gaelic (in some cases only with dialects of these) and shows a number of unique changes. There are two attested historical dialects of Manx, Northern Manx and Southern Manx.<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:xxvii\u2013xxviii, 160</ref> A third dialect may have existed in-between, around Douglas.\n\nManx shares with Scottish Gaelic the partial loss of contrastive [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalisation]] of [[labial consonant]]s; thus while in Irish the velarised consonants {{IPA|/p\u02e0 b\u02e0 f\u02e0 w m\u02e0/}} contrast [[phonemic]]ally with palatalised {{IPA|/p\u02b2 b\u02b2 f\u02b2 v\u02b2 m\u02b2/}}, in Scottish Gaelic and Manx, the phonemic contrast has been lost to some extent.<ref>Jackson 1955, 66. Jackson claims that northern Irish has also lost the contrast between velarised and palatalised labials, but this seems to be a mistake on his part, as both [[County Mayo|Mayo]] Irish and Ulster Irish are consistently described as having the contrast (cf. Mhac an Fhailigh 1968, 27; Hughes 1994, 621; see also \u00d3 Baoill 1978, 87)</ref> A consequence of this [[phonemic merger]] is that Middle Irish unstressed word-final {{IPA|[\u0259\u03b2\u02b2]}} (spelled ''-(a)ibh'', ''-(a)imh'' in Irish and Gaelic) has merged with {{IPA|[\u0259\u03b2]}} (''-(e)abh'', ''-(e)amh'') in Manx; both have become {{IPA|[u]}}, spelled ''-oo'' or ''-u(e)''. Examples include {{lang|gv|shassoo}} (\"to stand\"; Irish {{lang|ga|seasamh}}), {{lang|gv|credjue}} (\"religion\"; Irish {{lang|ga|creideamh}}), {{lang|gv|nealloo}} (\"fainting\"; Early Modern Irish {{lang|ga|(i) n\u00e9alaibh}}, lit. ''in clouds''), and {{lang|gv|erriu}} (\"on you (plural)\"; Irish {{lang|ga|oraibh}}).<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 77\u201382; Broderick 1984\u201386, 2:152</ref>\n\nMedial and final *bh and *mh have become {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} in general in Manx, thus ''shiu'' 'you PL', Scottish and Irish Gaelic ''sibh'' (''siph'' in Northern Irish, ''sib'' in South Connacht Irish; Lewis G\u00e0idhlig has the variant ''si\u00f9'', besides the more general ''sibh''), -bh in final consonant clusters, e.g. Manx ''sharroo'' 'bitter', Scottish ''searbh'' {{IPA|/\u0283\u00e6rav/}}, Northern and Western Irish ''searbh'' {{IPA|/\u0283\u00e6ru/}}, Southern Irish ''searbh'' {{IPA|/\u0283\u00e6r\u0259\u03b2/}}, between vowels, e.g. Manx ''awin'' 'river' , Scottish ''abhainn'' {{IPA|/avi\u0272/}}, Irish ''abhainn'' {{IPA|/aun\u02b2/}}, word-finally in monosyllables, e.g. Manx ''laaue'' 'hand', Scottish ''l\u00e0mh'' {{IPA|/la:v/}}, Northern Irish {{IPA|/l\u00e6:w/}}, Western Irish ''l\u00e1mh'' {{IPA|/l\u0251:w/}}, Southern Irish {{IPA|/l\u0251:\u03b2/}}, at the end of stressed syllables (see further below), as in ''sourey'' 'summer', Scotland and Ireland ''samhradh'', Scottish {{IPA|/saur\u0259\u0263/}}, Northern Irish {{IPA|/sauru/}}, Western and Southern Irish {{IPA|/saur\u0259/}}. In all this Manx is most like Northern Irish. Rare retentions of the older pronunciation of \"bh\" include ''Divlyn'', ''Divlin'' 'Dublin', Middle Irish ''Duibhlinn'' {{IPA|/d\u032au\u03b2\u02b2l\u02b2in\u02b2:/}}, also written ''Duibhlinn'' in Modern Irish and Scots Gaelic.\n\nMoreover, similarly to [[Munster Irish]], historical ''bh'' {{IPA|[\u03b2\u02b2]}} and ''mh'' (nasalised {{IPA|[\u03b2\u02b2]}}) tend to be lost in the middle or at the end of a word in Manx, either with [[compensatory lengthening]] or vocalisation as '''u''' resulting in [[diphthong]]isation with the preceding vowel. For example, Manx {{lang|gv|geurey}} (\"winter\") {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261\u02b2eur\u0259], [\u02c8\u0261\u02b2u\u02d0r\u0259]}} and {{lang|gv|sleityn}} (\"mountains\") {{IPA|[\u02c8sle\u02d0d\u0292\u0259n]}} correspond to Irish {{lang|ga|geimhreadh}} and {{lang|ga|sl\u00e9ibhte}} (Southern Irish dialect spelling and pronunciation ''g\u00edre'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u025fi\u02d0\u027e\u02b2\u0259]}}) and ''sl\u00e9te'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283l\u02b2e\u02d0t\u02b2\u0259]}})).<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 24; Broderick 1984\u201386 3:80\u201383; \u00d3 S\u00e9 2000:15, 120</ref> Another similarity to Munster Irish is the development of the Old Irish diphthongs {{IPA|[oi ai]}} before [[velarised]] consonants (spelled ''ao'' in Irish and Scottish Gaelic) to {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} in many words, as in {{lang|gv|seyr}} (\"carpenter\") {{IPA|[se\u02d0r]}} and {{lang|gv|keyl}} (\"narrow\") {{IPA|[ke\u02d0l]}} (spelled {{lang|ga|saor}} and {{lang|ga|caol}} in Irish and Scottish, and pronounced virtually the same in Munster).<ref>Jackson 1955, 47\u201350; \u00d3 Cu\u00edv 1944, 38, 91</ref>\n\nLike western and northern dialects of Irish (cf. [[Irish phonology#Word-initial consonant clusters|Irish phonology]]) and most dialects of Scottish Gaelic, Manx has changed the historical [[consonant cluster]]s {{IPA|/kn \u0261n mn tn/}} to {{IPA|/kr \u0261r mr tr/}}. For example, Middle Irish {{lang|mga|cn\u00e1id}} (\"mockery\") and {{lang|mga|mn\u00e1}} (\"women\") have become {{lang|gv|craid}} and {{lang|gv|mraane}} respectively in Manx.<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 22</ref> The [[affrication]] of {{IPA|[t\u032a\u02b2 d\u032a\u02b2]}} to {{IPA|[t\u0283 d\u0292]}} is also common to Manx, northern Irish, and Scottish Gaelic.<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 203</ref>\n\nAlso like northern and western dialects of Irish, as well as like southern dialects of Scottish Gaelic (e.g. [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Kintyre]]), the unstressed word-final syllable {{IPA|[i\u029d]}} of Middle Irish (spelled ''-(a)idh'' and ''-(a)igh'') has developed to {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} in Manx, where it is spelled ''-ee'', as in {{lang|gv|kionnee}} (\"buy\"; cf. Irish {{lang|ga|ceannaigh}}) and {{lang|gv|cullee}} (\"apparatus\"; cf. Gaelic {{lang|gd|culaidh}}).<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 57</ref>\n\nAnother property Manx shares with Ulster Irish and some dialects of Scottish Gaelic is that {{IPA|/a/}} rather than {{IPA|/\u0259/}} appears in unstressed syllables before {{IPA|/x/}} (in Manx spelling, ''agh''), for example {{lang|gv|jeeragh}} (\"straight\") {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0292i\u02d0rax]}} (Irish {{lang|ga|d\u00edreach}}), {{lang|gv|cooinaghtyn}} (\"to remember\") {{IPA|[\u02c8ku\u02d0n\u02b2axt\u032a\u0259n]}} (Gaelic {{lang|gd|cuimhneachd}}).<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 110; Jackson 1955, 55</ref>\n\nLike southern and western varieties of Irish and northern varieties of Scottish Gaelic, but unlike the geographically closer varieties of [[Ulster Irish]] and Arran and Kintyre Gaelic, Manx shows vowel lengthening or diphthongisation before the Old Irish [[Irish phonology#Fortis and lenis sonorants|fortis and lenis sonorants]]. For example, {{lang|gv|cloan}} (\"children\") {{IPA|[kl\u0254\u02d0n]}}, {{lang|gv|dhone}} (\"brown\") {{IPA|[d\u032ao\u02d0n]}}, {{lang|gv|eeym}} (\"butter\") {{IPA|[i\u02d0\u1d47m]}} correspond to Irish/Scottish Gaelic {{lang|ga|clann}}, {{lang|ga|donn}}, and {{lang|ga|im}} respectively, which have long vowels or diphthongs in western and southern Irish and in the Scottish Gaelic dialects of the [[Outer Hebrides]] and [[Skye]], thus western Irish {{IPA|[kl\u02e0\u0251\u02d0n\u032a\u02e0]}}, Southern Irish/Northern Scottish {{IPA|[kl\u032a\u02e0aun\u032a\u02e0]}}, {{IPA|[d\u032a\u02e0aun\u032a\u02e0]/[d\u032a\u02e0oun\u032a\u02e0]}}, {{IPA|[i\u02d0m]/[\u0264im]}}), but short vowels and 'long' consonants in northern Irish, Arran, and Kintyre, {{IPA|[kl\u032a\u02e0an\u032a\u02d0\u02e0]}}, {{IPA|[d\u032a\u02e0on\u032a\u02d0\u02e0]}} and {{IPA|[im\u02b2\u02d0]}}.<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 51; Jackson 1955, 57\u201358; Holmer 1957, 87, 88, 106; 1962, 41</ref>\n\nAnother similarity with southern Irish is the treatment of Middle Irish word-final unstressed {{IPA|[\u0259\u00f0]}}, spelled ''-(e)adh'' in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. In nouns (including [[verbal noun]]s), this became {{IPA|[\u0259]}} in Manx, as it did in southern Irish, e.g. {{lang|gv|caggey}} (\"war\") {{IPA|[\u02c8ka\u02d0\u0263\u0259]}}, {{lang|gv|moylley}} (\"to praise\") {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0254l\u0259]}}; cf. Irish {{lang|ga|cogadh}} and {{lang|ga|moladh}}, pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8k\u02e0\u0254\u0261\u02e0\u0259]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u02e0\u0254l\u032a\u02e0\u0259]}} in southern Irish.<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 68; Broderick 1984\u201386, 2:56, 308</ref> In [[finite verb]] forms before full nouns (as opposed to pronouns) {{IPA|[\u0259\u00f0]}} became {{IPA|[ax]}} in Manx, as in southern Irish, e.g. {{lang|gv|voyllagh}} {{IPA|[\u02c8v\u0254lax]}} (\"would praise\"), cf. Irish {{lang|ga|mholfadh}}, pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8\u03b2\u02e0\u0254l\u032a\u02e0h\u0259x]}} in southern Irish.<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 75</ref>\n\n[[File:Manx dialects.png|thumb|left|Dialect map of Manx (boundaries are approximate)]]\nLinguistic analysis of the last few dozen native speakers reveals a number of dialectal differences between the northern and the southern parts of the island. Northern Manx was reflected by speakers from towns and villages from [[Maughold]] in the northeast of the island to [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]] on the west coast. Southern Manx was used by speakers from the [[sheading]] of [[Rushen]]. It is possible that written Manx represents a 'midlands' dialect of Douglas and surrounding areas.\n\nIn Southern Manx, older ''\u00e1'' and in some cases ''\u00f3'' became {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0]}}. In Northern Manx the same happened, but ''\u00e1'' sometimes remained {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}} as well. For example, {{lang|gv|laa}} (\"day\", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|l\u00e1}}) was {{IPA|[l\u00e6\u02d0]}} in the south but {{IPA|[l\u00e6\u02d0]}} or {{IPA|[la\u02d0]}} in the north. Old ''\u00f3'' is always {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0]}} in both dialects, e.g. {{lang|gv|aeg}} (\"young\", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|\u00f3g}}) is {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0\u0261]}} in both dialects.<ref>Broderick 1984\u20138,6 1:160</ref> In many words before ''rt'', ''rd'' and ''rg'', and in one or two other words ''\u00e1'', lengthened ''a'' and ''\u00f3'' have become /\u0153:/, as in ''paayrt'' 'part' /p\u0153:rt/, ''ard'' 'high' /\u0153:rd/, ''jiarg'' 'red' /d\u0292\u0153:rg/, ''argid'' 'money, silver' /\u0153:rgid/ and ''aarey'' 'gold GEN' /\u0153:r\u0259/.\n\nIn Northern Manx, older ''(e)a'' before ''nn'' in the same syllable is diphthongised, while in Southern Manx it is lengthened but remains a [[monophthong]]. For example, {{lang|gv|kione}} (\"head\", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|ceann}}) is {{IPA|[k\u02b2aun]}} in the north but {{IPA|[k\u02b2o\u02d0n]}} in the south.<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:161</ref>\n\nWords with ''ua'' and in some cases ''ao'' in Irish and Scottish are spelled with ''eay'' in Manx. In Northern Manx, this sound was {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}}, while in Southern Manx it was {{IPA|[\u026f\u02d0]}}, {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}}, or {{IPA|[y\u02d0]}}. For example, {{lang|gv|geay}} (\"wind\", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|gaoth}}) is {{IPA|[\u0261i\u02d0]}} in the north and {{IPA|[\u0261\u026f\u02d0]}} in the south, while {{lang|gv|geayl}} (\"coal\", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|gual}}) is {{IPA|[\u0261i\u02d0l]}} in the north and {{IPA|[\u0261y\u02d0l]}}, {{IPA|[\u0261\u026f\u02d0l]}}, or {{IPA|[\u0261u\u02d0l]}} in the south.<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:161\u201362</ref>\n\nIn both the north and the south, there is a tendency to insert a short {{IPA|[d]}} sound before a word-final {{IPA|[n]}} in monosyllabic words, as in {{IPA|[sle\u1d48n]}} for {{lang|gv|slane}} (\"whole\") and {{IPA|[be\u1d48n]}} for {{lang|gv|ben}} (\"woman\"). This phenomenon is known as [[pre-occlusion]]. In Southern Manx, however, there is pre-occlusion of {{IPA|[d]}} before {{IPA|[l]}} and of {{IPA|[\u0261]}} before {{IPA|[\u014b]}}, as in {{IPA|[\u0283u\u02d0\u1d48l]}} for {{lang|gv|shooyl}} (\"walking\") and {{IPA|[l\u0254\u1da2\u014b]}} for {{lang|gv|lhong}} (\"ship\"). These forms are generally pronounced without pre-occlusion in the north. Preocclusion of {{IPA|[b]}} before {{IPA|[m]}}, on the other hand, is more common in the north, as in {{lang|gv|trome}} (\"heavy\"), which is {{IPA|[t\u032aro\u1d47m]}} in the north but {{IPA|[t\u032aro\u02d0m]}} or {{IPA|[t\u032aro\u02d0\u1d47m]}} in the south.<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:162\u201363</ref> This feature is also found in [[Cornish language|Cornish]].\n\nSouthern Manx tended to lose word-initial {{IPA|[\u0261]}} before {{IPA|[l\u02b2]}}, while Northern Manx usually preserved it, e.g. {{lang|gv|glion}} (\"glen\") is {{IPA|[\u0261l\u02b2\u0254\u1d48n]}} in the north and {{IPA|[l\u02b2\u0254\u1d48n]}} in the south, and {{lang|gv|glioon}} (\"knee\") is {{IPA|[\u0261l\u02b2u\u02d0n]}} in the north and {{IPA|[l\u02b2u\u02d0\u1d48n]}} in the south.<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:164\u201365</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Phrases==\nSome simple conversational words and phrases:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=300pt|English (Baarle) !!

[[Classical Irish]], which was the language of the educated Gaelic elite of both Ireland and Scotland (where it is called [[Classical Gaelic]]) until the mid-19th century. In general, these orthographies retain spelling and derivation from older Gaelic, which means that there is not in a one-to-one system. Both systems use only 18 letters to represent around 50 phonemes. While Manx in effect uses the English spelling system, except for {{angle bracket|x}} and {{angle bracket|z}}, the 24 letters used in its orthography likewise covers a similar range of phonemes, and therefore many digraphs and trigraphs are used.\n\nThe Manx orthography was developed by people who were unaware of traditional Gaelic orthography, as they had learned literacy in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and English (the initial development in the 16th century), then only English (later developments). Therefore, the orthography is based on early Modern English pronunciation, and to a small extent Welsh, rather than from a pan-Gaelic point of view.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Kelly|1870|p=xiii}} footnote in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NZENAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR13 Spoken Sound as a Rule for Orthography]'', credited to W. Mackenzie.</ref> The result is an inconsistent and only partially phonemic spelling system, in a similar way as spelling in English. [[T.&nbsp;F. O'Rahilly]] expressed the opinion that Gaelic in the Isle of Man was saddled with an inadequate spelling which is neither traditional nor phonetic; if the traditional Gaelic orthography had been preserved, the close kinship that exists between Manx Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic would be obvious to all at first sight.<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 128</ref>\n\nThere is no evidence of [[Gaelic type|Gaelic script]] having been used on the island.\n\n===Cedilla===\nManx uses relatively few [[diacritic]]s, but a [[cedilla]] is often (but not exclusively) used to differentiate between the two pronunciations of ''ch'':\n* ''\u00c7hiarn'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0361\u0283a\u02d0rn/}}), meaning ''lord'', is pronounced with the [[voiceless palato-alveolar affricate|palato-alveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}, as in the English \"'''ch'''urch\"\n* ''Chamoo'' ({{IPA|/xa\u02c8mu/}}), meaning ''nor'' or ''neither'', is pronounced with the [[voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]] {{IPA|/x/}}, as in the [[Standard Scottish English|Scottish]] pronunciation of the word \"lo'''ch'''\" ({{IPA|/\u02c8l\u0252x/}}), a sound which is commonly represented by ''gh'' at the ends of words in Manx (as it often is in the English of Ireland).\n\n===Examples===\nThe following examples are taken from Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:178\u201379 and 1:350\u201353. The first example is from a speaker of Northern Manx, the second from [[Ned Maddrell]], a speaker of Southern Manx.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Orthography\n!Phonetic transcription\n!Gloss\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|V'ad smooinaghtyn dy beagh cabbyl jeeaghyn skee as deinagh ayns y voghree dy beagh eh er ve ec ny ferrishyn fud ny h-oie as beagh ad cur lesh yn saggyrt dy cur e vannaght er.}}\n|{{IPA|vod\u032a \u02c8smu\u02d0n\u02b2axt\u032a\u0259n d\u032a\u0259 bi\u0259x \u02c8ka\u02d0b\u0259l d\u0292i\u02d0\u0259n ski\u02d0 as \u02c8d\u032a\u00f8in\u02b2ax uns \u0259 \u02c8vo\u02d0x\u0259ri d\u032a\u0259 bi\u0259x e er vi ek n\u0259 \u02c8feri\u0283\u0259n fod\u032a n\u0259 h\u00f8i as bi\u0259x \u0259d\u032a k\u00f8r le\u0283 \u0259n \u02c8sa\u02d0\u0261\u0259rt\u032a d\u032a\u0259 k\u00f8r \u0259 \u02c8vanax er}}\n|They used to think if a horse was looking tired and weary in the morning then it had been with the fairies all night and they would bring the priest to put his blessing on it.\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|Va ben aynshoh yn \u00e7hiaghtin chaie as v'ee laccal mish dy ynsagh ee dy gra yn Padjer yn \u00c7hiarn.

An alternative analysis is that Manx has the following system, where the vowels {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} have allophones ranging from {{IPA|[\u025b]/[\u025b\u02d0]}} through {{IPA|[\u00e6]/[\u00e6\u02d0]}} to {{IPA|[a]/[a\u02d0]}}. As with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, there is a large amount of vowel allophony, such as that of {{IPA|/a/, /a\u02d0/}}.

Nouns are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]]. The [[plural]] is formed in a variety of ways, most commonly by addition of the suffix {{lang|gv|-yn}} {{IPA|[\u0259n]}}, but also by vowel change, changing {{lang|gv|-agh}} {{IPA|[ax]}} to {{lang|gv|-ee}} {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} or {{lang|gv|-eeghyn}} {{IPA|[i\u02d0\u0259n]}} or by adding other endings. There is usually no inflection for [[grammatical case|case]], except in a minority of nouns that have a distinct genitive singular form, which is formed in various ways. (Most common is the addition of the suffix ''-ey'' {{IPA|[\u0259]}} to feminine nouns.) Historical genitive singulars are often encountered in [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] even when they are no longer [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] forms; for example {{lang|gv|thie-ollee}} \"cowhouse\" uses the old genitive of {{lang|gv|ollagh}} \"cattle\".<ref>Thomson 1992, 118\u201319; Broderick 1993, 239\u201340</ref> There are also traces of a dative singular in set phrases such as {{lang|gv|ry-chosh}} \"on foot\", contrasting with nominative {{lang|gv|cass}} and genitive {{lang|gv|coshey}} (cf. {{lang|gv|cullee choshey}} \"footwear\", {{lang|gv|bluckan coshey}} \"football, soccer, rugby\").<ref>{{Cite book|title=First Lessons in Manx|last=Goodwin|first=Edmund|last2=Thomson|first2=Robert|publisher=Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh|year=1966|page=50}}</ref>\n\n=== Adjectives ===\nCertain adjectives have plural as well as singular forms (through the addition ''-ey'' {{IPA|[\u0259]}}), although the use of the singular adjective with a plural noun is usual. Most adjectives end in ''-agh'' {{IPA|[ax]}} and form their [[comparative]]/[[superlative]] form by replacing this with ''-ee'' {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}}, e.g. ''at\u00e7himagh'' \"terrible\" becomes ''at\u00e7himee'', giving ''ny s'at\u00e7himee'' \"more terrible\" and ''s'at\u00e7himee'' \"most terrible\". As in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the comparative-superlative is commonly marked by the copula verb ''s'' (''is'') in the present, and ''by'' in the past; the superlative is often shown by the word \"nys\" /nis/, from Middle Irish ''n\u00ed as'' \"thing that is\" (cf. Irish ''n\u00edos'', past ''n\u00ed ba'').<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conversational Manx|last=Gell|first=John|publisher=Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh|year=1989|isbn=1870029100|location=St. Judes|page=34}}</ref> A number of adjectives form their comparative/superlative irregularly:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Irregular comparative/superlative forms of Manx adjectives\n!Positive\n!English\n!Comparative/Superlative\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|aalin}}\n|beautiful\n|{{lang|gv|aaley}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|aashag}}\n|easy\n|{{lang|gv|assey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|aeg}}\n|young\n|{{lang|gv|aa}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|ard}}\n|high\n|{{lang|gv|yrjey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|beg}}\n|small\n|{{lang|gv|loo}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|bog}}\n|soft, moist\n|{{lang|gv|buiggey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|bwaagh}}\n|pretty\n|{{lang|gv|bwaaie}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|\u00e7heh}}\n|hot\n|{{lang|gv|\u00e7hoe}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|\u00e7hionn}}\n|tight, fast\n|{{lang|gv|\u00e7henney}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|\u00e7hiu}}\n|thick\n|{{lang|gv|\u00e7hee}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|faggys}}\n|near\n|{{lang|gv|niessey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|foddey}}\n|far, long\n|{{lang|gv|odjey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|garroo}}\n|rough\n|{{lang|gv|girroo}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|gial}}\n|bright, white\n|{{lang|gv|gilley}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|giare}}\n|short\n|{{lang|gv|girrey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|lajer}}\n|strong\n|{{lang|gv|troshey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|leah}}\n|soon\n|{{lang|gv|leaie}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|lheann}}\n|wide\n|{{lang|gv|lea}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|liauyr}}\n|long, tall\n|{{lang|gv|lhiurey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|mie}}\n|good\n|{{lang|gv|share}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|moal}}\n|slow\n|{{lang|gv|melley}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|mooar}}\n|large, big\n|{{lang|gv|moo}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|olk}}\n|bad, evil\n|{{lang|gv|messey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|reagh}}\n|merry, lively\n|{{lang|gv|reaie}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|roauyr}}\n|fat, broad\n|{{lang|gv|riurey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|shenn}}\n|old\n|{{lang|gv|shinney}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|thanney}}\n|thin\n|{{lang|gv|theinney}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|trome}}\n|heavy\n|{{lang|gv|thrimmey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|ymmodee}}\n|many\n|{{lang|gv|lee}}\n|}\nThe comparative/superlative can also be formed using {{lang|gv|smoo}} \"more\" with the positive form e.g. {{lang|gv|s'thrimmey}} = {{lang|gv|smoo trome}}.\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nIn common with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, in addition to its regular personal pronouns, Manx has also a series used for emphasis. Under certain phonological circumstances, these can be used as unemphatic pronouns, e.g. \"you were not\" is {{lang|gv|cha row uss}} {{IPA|[xa \u02c8rau \u028as]}} as {{lang|gv|cha row oo}} {{IPA|[xa \u02c8rau u(\u02d0)]}} sounds too similar to {{lang|gv|cha row}} {{IPA|[xa \u02c8rau]}} \"they/he/she was not\".\n\nNotice the only difference between the masculine and feminine third person singular possessive pronouns is the [[Consonant mutation|initial sound change]], namely lenition and h-prefixing, they cause, e.g. {{lang|gv|e glioonag}} \"her laptop\", {{lang|gv|e ghlioonag}} \"his laptop\", ''e ooh'' \"his egg\", ''e hooh'' \"her egg\".\n\nAn alternative to using the possessive pronouns is to precede a noun with the definite article and follow it with the inflected form of {{lang|gv|ec}} \"at\" to show the person, e.g. {{lang|gv|yn thie aym}} \"my house\" (literally \"the house at me\") instead of {{lang|gv|my hie}} \"my house\". This is especially useful in the plural, where all persons share one possessive pronoun, e.g. {{lang|gv|yn thie oc}} \"their house\", as opposed to {{lang|gv|nyn dhie}} \"our/your/their house\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Manx personal pronouns'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Person\n!Regular\n!Emphatic\n!Possessive\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | First singular\n|{{lang|gv|mee}}\n|{{lang|gv|mish}}\n|{{lang|gv|my}}<sup>[[Template:Ref label|[1]]]</sup>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Second singular\n|{{lang|gv|oo}}\n|{{lang|gv|uss}}\n|{{lang|gv|dty}}<sup>[[Template:Ref label|[1]]]</sup>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Third singular\n!masculine\n|{{lang|gv|eh}}\n|{{lang|gv|eshyn}}\n|{{lang|gv|e}}<sup>[[Template:Ref label|[1]]]</sup>\n|-\n!feminine\n|{{lang|gv|ee}}\n|{{lang|gv|ish}}\n|{{lang|gv|e}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | First plural\n|{{lang|gv|shin}}\n|{{lang|gv|shinyn}}\n|{{lang|gv|nyn}}<sup>[[Template:Ref label|[2]]]</sup>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Second plural\n|{{lang|gv|shiu}}\n|{{lang|gv|shiuish}}\n|{{lang|gv|nyn}}<sup>[[Template:Ref label|[2]]]</sup>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Third plural\n|{{lang|gv|ad}}\n|{{lang|gv|adsyn}}\n|{{lang|gv|nyn}}<sup>[[Template:Ref label|[2]]]</sup>\n|}\n\n1.'''[[Template:Ref label|^]]''' Causes lenition.\n\n2.'''[[Template:Ref label|^]]''' Causes eclipsis.\n\n=== Verbs ===\nManx verbs generally form their [[finite verb|finite]] forms by means of [[periphrasis]]: inflected forms of the [[auxiliary verb]]s {{lang|gv|ve}} \"to be\" or {{lang|gv|jannoo}} \"to do\" are combined with the [[verbal noun]] of the main verb. Only the [[future tense|future]], [[conditional tense|conditional]], [[preterite]], and [[imperative mood|imperative]] can be formed directly by inflecting the main verb, but even in these tenses, the periphrastic formation is more common in Late Spoken Manx.<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 75\u201382; 1993, 250, 271; Thomson 1992, 122</ref> Examples:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|+ '''Manx finite verb forms'''\n|-\n!

Independent forms are used when the verb is not preceded by any particle; dependent forms are used when a particle (e.g. {{lang|gv|cha}} \"not\") does precede the verb. For example, \"you will lose\" is {{lang|gv|caillee oo}} with the independent form {{lang|gv|caillee}} (\"will lose\"), while \"you will not lose\" is {{lang|gv|cha gaill oo}} with the dependent form {{lang|gv|caill}} (which has undergone [[#Initial consonant mutations|eclipsis]] to {{lang|gv|gaill}} after {{lang|gv|cha}}). Similarly \"they went\" is {{lang|gv|hie ad}} with the independent form {{lang|gv|hie}} (\"went\"), while \"they did not go\" is {{lang|gv|cha jagh ad}} with the dependent form {{lang|gv|jagh}}.<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:92; 1992, 250; Thomson 1992, 122</ref> This contrast is inherited from Old Irish, which shows such pairs as {{lang|sga|beirid}} (\"(s)he carries\") vs. {{lang|sga|n\u00ed beir}} (\"(s)he does not carry\"), and is found in Scottish Gaelic as well, e.g. {{lang|gd|gabhaidh}} (\"will take\") vs. {{lang|gd|cha ghabh}} (\"will not take\").

Irish ''maith'', ''go maith'', Gaelic ''math'', ''gu maith'');  {{lang|gv|gennal}} \"cheerful\", {{lang|gv|dy gennal}} \"cheerfully\". This {{lang|gv|dy}} is not used when preceded by such words as {{lang|gv|ro}} \"too\" and {{lang|gv|feer}} \"very\" or followed by {{lang|gv|dy liooar}} \"enough\", e.g. {{lang|gv|feer vie}} \"very good, very well\", {{lang|gv|gennal dy liooar}} \"cheerful(ly) enough\". The prepositional phrase for \"home(wards)\" is formed with {{lang|gv|dy}} \"to\" and the noun {{lang|gv|balley}} \"place, town, homestead\" to give {{lang|gv|dy valley}}, Cf. Irish ''abhaile'', older ''do bhaile'', whereas the noun {{lang|gv|thie}} \"house, home\" can be used unchanged to convey the same meaning.\n\nThe language has a number of adverbs corresponding to English \"up\" and \"down\", the meaning of which depend upon such things as motion or lack thereof and starting point in relation to the speaker.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Manx adverbs expressing \"up\" and \"down\"\n|-\n! \n! above the speaker\n! below the speaker\n|-\n!

In this case, only the auxiliary verb precedes the subject, while the verbal noun comes after the subject. The auxiliary verb may be a [[modal verb]] rather than a form of {{lang|gv|bee}} (\"be\") or {{lang|gv|jannoo}} (\"do\"). Particles like the negative {{lang|gv|cha}} (\"not\") precede the inflected verb. Examples:\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n{|\n| {{sm|main<br />verb}}\n| colspan=2 | {{sm|subject}}\n| colspan=2 | {{sm|direct<br />object}}\n|-\n| {{lang|gv|Hug}} || {{lang|gv|yn}} || {{lang|gv|saggyrt}} || {{lang|gv|e}} || {{lang|gv|laue}} || {{lang|gv|urree.}}\n|-\n| put-{{sc|pret}} || the || priest || his || hand || on her\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"The priest put his hand on her.\"<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:181</ref>\n|}\n&nbsp;\n{|\n| {{sm|aux.<br />verb}}\n| colspan=2 | {{sm|subject}}\n| {{sm|main<br />verb}}\n| colspan=2 | {{sm|direct<br />object}}\n|-\n| {{lang|gv|Va}} || {{lang|gv|ny}} || {{lang|gv|eayin}} || {{lang|gv|gee}} || {{lang|gv|yn}} || {{lang|gv|conney.}}\n|-\n| were || the || lambs || eat-{{sc|v.n.}} || the || gorse\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"The lambs used to eat the gorse.\"<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:179</ref>\n|}\n&nbsp;\n{|\n|  || {{sm|modal<br />verb}} || {{sm|subject}} || {{sm|main<br />verb}} || {{sm|direct<br />object}}\n|-\n| {{lang|gv|Cha}} || {{lang|gv|jarg}} || {{lang|gv|shiu}} || {{lang|gv|fakin}} || {{lang|gv|red erbee.}}\n|-\n| not || can || you-{{sc|pl}} || see-{{sc|v.n.}} || anything\n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"You can't see anything.\"<ref>Broderick 1993, 274</ref>\n|}\n</div>\n\nWhen the auxiliary verb is a form of {{lang|gv|jannoo}} (\"do\"), the direct object precedes the verbal noun and is connected to it with the particle {{lang|gv|y}}:\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n{|\n| {{sm|aux.<br />verb}} || {{sm|subject}}\n| colspan=2 | {{sm|direct<br />object}}\n|  || {{sm|main<br />verb}}\n|-\n| {{lang|gv|Ren}} || {{lang|gv|ad}} || {{lang|gv|my}} || {{lang|gv|choraa}} || {{lang|gv|y}} || {{lang|gv|chlashtyn.}}\n|-\n| did || they || my || voice || {{sc|particle}} || hear-{{sc|v.n.}}\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"They heard my voice.\"<ref name=\"Thoms105\"/>\n|}\n</div>\n\nAs in Irish (cf. [[Irish syntax#The forms meaning \"to be\"]]), there are two ways of expressing \"to be\" in Manx: with the substantive verb {{lang|gv|bee}}, and with the copula. The substantive verb is used when the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] is an adjective, adverb, or [[prepositional phrase]].<ref>Broderick 1993, 276\u201377</ref> Examples:\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|t'}} || {{lang|gv|eh}} || {{lang|gv|agglagh}}\n|-\n| is || it || awful/frightening\n|-\n| colspan=3 | \"It is awful/frightening.\"\n|}\n&nbsp;\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|t'}} || {{lang|gv|eh}} || {{lang|gv|dy mie}}\n|-\n| is || he || well\n|-\n| colspan=3 | \"He is well\"\n|}\n&nbsp;\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|t'}} || {{lang|gv|eh}} || {{lang|gv|ayns}} || {{lang|gv|y}} || {{lang|gv|thie-oast}}\n|-\n| is || he || in || the || house-ale ([[pub]])\n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"He is in the ale-house ([[pub]]).\"\n|}\n</div>\n\nWhere the predicate is a noun, it must be converted to a prepositional phrase headed by the preposition {{lang|gv|in}} (\"in\") + possessive pronoun (agreeing with the subject) in order for the substantive verb to be grammatical:\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|t'}} || {{lang|gv|eh}} || {{lang|gv|ny}} || {{lang|gv|wooinney}} || {{lang|gv|mie}}\n|-\n| is || he || in-his || man || good\n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"He is a good man\" (lit. \"He is in his good man\")<ref>Broderick 1993, 277</ref>\n|}\n</div>\n\nOtherwise, the copula is used when the predicate is a noun. The copula itself takes the form {{lang|gv|is}} or {{lang|gv|she}} in the present tense, but it is often omitted in affirmative statements:\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|She}} || {{lang|gv|Manninagh}} || {{lang|gv|mish}}\n|-\n| {{sc|copula}} || Manxman || me\n|-\n| colspan=3 | \"I am a Manxman.\"<ref>Broderick 1993, 278</ref>\n|}\n&nbsp;\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|Shoh}} || {{lang|gv|'n}} || {{lang|gv|dooinney}}\n|-\n| this || the || man\n| colspan=3 | \"This is the man.\"<ref name=Thoms105>Thomson 1992, 105</ref>\n|}\n</div>\n\nIn questions and negative sentences, the present tense of the copula is {{lang|gv|nee}}:\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|Cha}} || {{lang|gv|nee}} || {{lang|gv|mish}} || {{lang|gv|eh}}\n|-\n| not || {{sc|copula}} || me || him\n|-\n| colspan=4 | \"I am not him.\"<ref name=Thoms105 />\n|}\n&nbsp;\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|Nee}} || {{lang|gv|shoh}} || {{lang|gv|'n}} || {{lang|gv|lioar?}}\n|-\n| {{sc|copula}} || this || the || book\n|-\n| colspan=4 | \"Is this the book?\"<ref name=Thoms105 />\n|}\n</div>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nManx vocabulary is predominantly of Goidelic origin, derived from Old Irish and closely related to words in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. However, Manx itself, as well as the languages from which it is derived, borrowed words from other languages as well, especially [[Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[French language|French]] (particularly [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]), and English (both [[Middle English]] and Modern English).<ref>Broderick 1993, 282\u201383</ref>\n\nThe following table shows a selection of nouns from the [[Swadesh list]] and indicates their pronunciations and etymologies.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Manx\n!IPA<ref name=Brodvol2>Broderick 1984\u201386, vol. 2</ref>\n!English\n!Etymology<ref>Macbain 1911; ''Dictionary of the Irish Language''; Broderick 1984\u201386, vol. 2</ref>\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|aane}}\n|{{IPA|[e\u02d0n]}}\n|liver\n|Goidelic; from Mid.Ir. {{lang|mga|ae}} < O.Ir. {{lang|sga|\u00f3a}}; cf.

The name means \"mousy grey\" in Manx.]]\nForeign loanwords are primarily [[Norse language|Norse]] and [[English language|English]], with a smaller number coming from French. Some examples of Norse loanwords are ''garey'' (\"[[garden]]\", from ''[[wikt:gar\u00f0r|gar\u00f0r]]'', \"enclosure\") and ''sker'' meaning a sea rock (from ''[[wikt:sker|sker]]'', compare with ''[[wikt:skj\u00e6r#Etymology 2|skj\u00e6r]]'' and ''[[wikt:sker#Icelandic|sker]]''). Examples of French loanwords are ''danjeyr'' (\"danger\", from ''[[wikt:danger#French|danger]]'') and ''vondeish'' (\"advantage\", from ''[[wikt:avantage|avantage]]'').\n\nEnglish loanwords were common in late (pre-revival) Manx, e.g. ''boy'' (\"boy\"), ''badjer'' (\"[[badger]]\"), rather than the more usual Gaelic ''guilley'' and ''brock''. [[Henry Jenner]], on asking someone what he was doing, was told ''Ta mee smokal pipe'' (\"I am smoking a pipe\"), and that \"[he] certainly considered that he was talking Manx, and not English, in saying it.\" In more recent years, there has been a reaction against such borrowing, resulting in coinages for technical vocabulary. Despite this, [[calque]]s exist in Manx, not necessarily obvious to its speakers.\n\nSome religious terms come ultimately from Latin, Greek and Hebrew, e.g. ''casherick'' (holy), from the Latin ''consecr\u0101tus''; ''mooinjer'' (people) from the Latin ''monasterium'' (originally a [[monastery]]; ''agglish'' (church) from the Greek ''\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1'' (''ekklesia'', literally meaning assembly) and ''abb'' ([[abbot]]) from the Hebrew \"\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0\" (''abba'', meaning \"father\"). These did not necessarily come directly into Manx, but via Old Irish. In more recent times, ''ulpan'' has been borrowed from [[modern Hebrew]]. Many Irish and English loanwords also have a classical origin, e.g. ''\u00e7hellveeish'' (Irish ''teilef\u00eds'') and ''\u00e7hellvane'' meaning [[television]] and [[telephone]] respectively. Foreign language words (usually known via English) are used occasionally especially for ethnic food, e.g. chorizo, spaghetti.\n\nTo fill gaps in recorded Manx vocabulary, revivalists have referred to modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic for words and inspiration.\n\nGoing in the other direction, Manx Gaelic has influenced [[Manx English]] (Anglo-Manx). Common words and phrases in Anglo-Manx originating in the language include ''tholtan'' (the \"th\" is pronounced as a \"t\") meaning a ruined farmhouse, ''quaaltagh'' meaning a [[first-foot]], ''keeill'' meaning a church (especially an old one), ''[[cammag]]'', ''traa-dy-liooar'' meaning \"time enough\", and [[Tynwald]] (''tinvaal''), which is ultimately of Norse origin, but comes via Manx. It is suggested that the [[House of Keys]] takes its name from ''Kiare as Feed'' (four and twenty), which is the number of its sitting members.\n\n==Comparative vocabulary examples==\n\n<center>\n{| cellspacing=\"7\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! style=\"background:#ffdead;\"| Manx Gaelic\n! style=\"background:#ffdead;\"| Irish\n! style=\"background:#ffdead;\"| Scots Gaelic\n! style=\"background:#ffdead;\"| Welsh\n! style=\"background:#ffdead;\"| English\n|- \n| ''Moghrey mie''\n| {{lang|ga|Maidin mhaith}}\n| {{lang|gd|Madainn mhath}}\n| {{lang|cy|Bore da}}\n| good morning\n|- \n| ''Fastyr mie''\n| {{lang|ga|Tr\u00e1thn\u00f3na maith}}\n| {{lang|gd|Feasgar math}}\n| {{lang|cy|Prynhawn da}}<br />{{lang|cy|Noswaith dda}}\n| good afternoon/evening\n|- \n| ''Slane lhiat'', ''Slane lhiu''\n| {{lang|ga|Sl\u00e1n leat}}, {{lang|ga|Sl\u00e1n libh}}\n| {{lang|gd|Sl\u00e0n leat}}, {{lang|gd|Sl\u00e0n leibh}}\n| {{lang|cy|Hwyl fawr}}\n| goodbye\n|- \n| ''Gura mie ayd'',<br />''Gura mie eu''\n| {{lang|ga|Go raibh maith agat}},<br />{{lang|ga|Go raibh maith agaibh}}\n| {{lang|gd|Tapadh leat}},<br />{{lang|gd|Tapadh leibh}}\n| {{lang|cy|Diolch}}\n| thank you\n|- \n| ''baatey''\n| {{lang|ga|b\u00e1d}}\n| {{lang|gd|b\u00e0ta}}\n| {{lang|cy|cwch}}\n| boat\n|- \n| ''barroose''\n| {{lang|ga|bus}}\n| {{lang|gd|bus}}\n| {{lang|cy|bws}}\n| bus\n|-\n| ''blaa''\n| {{lang|ga|bl\u00e1th}}\n| {{lang|gd|bl\u00e0th}}\n| {{lang|cy|blodyn}}\n| flower\n|- \n| ''booa''\n| {{lang|ga|b\u00f3}}\n| {{lang|gd|b\u00f2}}\n| {{lang|cy|buwch/bo}}\n| cow\n|- \n| ''cabbyl''\n| {{lang|ga|capall}}\n| {{lang|gd|capall}}\n| {{lang|cy|ceffyl}}\n| horse\n|- \n| ''cashtal''\n| {{lang|ga|caisle\u00e1n, caiseal}}\n| {{lang|gd|caisteal}}\n| {{lang|cy|castell}}\n| castle\n|- \n| ''creg''\n| {{lang|ga|carraig}}\n| {{lang|gd|carraig, creag}}\n| {{lang|cy|carreg}}\n| stone\n|- \n| ''eeast''\n| {{lang|ga|iasc}}\n| {{lang|gd|iasg}}\n| {{lang|cy|pysgodyn}}\n| fish [sg.]\n|- \n| ''ellan''\n| {{lang|ga|oile\u00e1n}}\n| {{lang|gd|eilean}}\n| {{lang|cy|ynys}}\n| island, eyot\n|- \n| ''gleashtan''\n| {{lang|ga|gluaiste\u00e1n}}, {{lang|ga|carr}}\n| {{lang|gd|c\u00e0r}}\n| {{lang|cy|car}}\n| car\n|- \n| ''kayt''\n| {{lang|ga|cat}}\n| {{lang|gd|cat}}\n| {{lang|cy|cath}}\n| cat\n|- \n| ''moddey''\n| {{lang|ga|madra}}, {{lang|ga|madadh}}\n| {{lang|gd|madadh}}\n| {{lang|cy|ci}}\n| dog, hound\n|- \n| ''shap''\n| {{lang|ga|siopa}}\n| {{lang|gd|b\u00f9th}}\n| {{lang|cy|siop}}\n| shop\n|- \n| ''thie''\n| {{lang|ga|tigh}}, {{lang|ga|teach}}\n| {{lang|gd|taigh}}\n| {{lang|cy|t\u0177}}\n| house\n|- \n| ''eean''\n| {{lang|ga|\u00e9an}}\n| {{lang|gd|eun}}, {{lang|gd|ian}}\n| {{lang|cy|aderyn}}, {{lang|cy|edn}}\n| bird\n|-\n| ''jees'', ''daa''\n| {{lang|ga|d\u00e1, dh\u00e1, d\u00f3; (people) beirt, d\u00eds}}\n| {{lang|gd|d\u00e0, dh\u00e0; (people) dithis}}\n| {{lang|cy|dau}} (m.)/{{lang|cy|dwy}} (f.)\n| two\n|-\n| ''oik''\n| {{lang|ga|oifig}}\n| {{lang|gd|oifis}}\n| {{lang|cy|swyddfa}}\n| office\n|-\n| ''ushtey''\n| {{lang|ga|uisce}}\n| {{lang|gd|uisge}}\n| {{lang|cy|d\u0175r}}, {{lang|cy|dwfr}}\n| water\n|}\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n* [[Cornish language|Cornish]], another revived [[Celtic language]].\n* [[Gaelic revival|Irish language revival]]\n* [[List of Celtic-language media]]\n* [[List of revived languages]]\n* [[List of television channels in Celtic languages]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* <!--Broderick 1984\u201386-->{{Cite book|title=A Handbook of Late Spoken Manx |first=George |last=Broderick |publisher=Niemeyer |location=T\u00fcbingen |year=1984\u201386 |edition=3 volumes |isbn=3-484-42903-8 |id=(vol.&nbsp;1), (vol.&nbsp;2), (vol.&nbsp;3)}}\n* <!--Broderick 1993-->{{Cite book|first=George |last=Broderick |pages=228\u201385 |chapter=Manx |editor=M.

Despite this, the language has never fallen completely out of use, with a minority having some knowledge of it; in addition, Manx still has a role as an important part of the island's culture and heritage. Manx has been the subject of [[language revival]] efforts; in 2015, around 1,800 people had varying levels of [[second language]] conversational ability. Since the late 20th century, Manx has become more visible on the island, with increased signage, radio broadcasts and a Manx-medium primary school. The revival of Manx has been made easier because the language was well recorded: for example, the Bible had been translated into Manx, and audio recordings had been made of native speakers.\n\n==Names of the language==\n\n===In Manx===\nIn Manx, the language is called ''Gaelg'' or ''Gailck'' (pronounced \"gilk\" or \"gilg\" or \"gelg\" with hard Gs), a word which shares the same etymology as the word \"Gaelic\". The sister languages of [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] use ''Gaeilge'' (dialect variants Gaoluinn, Gaedhlag, Gaelge and Gaelic) and ''G\u00e0idhlig'', respectively, for their languages. As with Irish and Scottish, the form with the [[definite article]] is frequently used in Manx, e.g. ''y Ghaelg'' or ''y Ghailck'' (Irish ''an Ghaeilge'', Scottish ''a' Gh\u00e0idhlig'').\n\nTo distinguish it from the two other forms of Gaelic, the phrases ''Gaelg''/''Gailck Vannin'' (Gaelic of [[Isle of Man|Mann]]) and ''Gaelg''/''Gailck Vanninnagh'' (Manx Gaelic) also are used. In addition, the nickname \"\u00c7hengey ny Mayrey\" (the mother tongue/tongue of the mother, lit. the mother's tongue) is occasionally used.\n\n===In English===\nThe language is usually referred to in English as \"Manx\". The term \"Manx Gaelic\" is often used, for example when discussing the relationship between the three Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Manx) or to avoid confusion with [[Manx English|Anglo-Manx]], the form of English spoken on the island. Scottish Gaelic is often referred to in English as simply \"Gaelic\", but this is less common with Manx and Irish.\n\nA feature of Anglo-Manx deriving from Gaelic<!--- not really a calque---> is the use of the definite article, e.g. \"the Manx\", \"the Gaelic\", in ways not generally seen in standard English.\n\nThe word \"Manx\" is frequently spelled \"Manks\" in historical sources, particularly those written by natives of the island; the word means \"Mannish\", and originates from the [[Old Norse]] ''Mannisk''. The name of the island, Man, is frequently spelled \"Mann\". It is sometimes accompanied by a footnote explaining that it is a two-syllable word, with the stress on the first syllable, \"MAN-en\". The island is named after the Irish god [[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir]], thus ''Ellan Vannin'' (Irish ''Oile\u00e1n Mhannan\u00e1in'') 'Mannan\u00e1n's Island'.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Clagh Ogham ec Thie Tashtee Vannin.jpg|right|thumb|200px|An [[ogham inscription]] on a stone in the [[Manx Museum]] written in Primitive Irish and which reads DOVAIDONA MAQI DROATA, \"Of Dovaido, son of Droata\"<ref>{{cite web |last=West |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew West (linguist) |url=http://babelstone.blogspot.ie/2011/06/ogham-stones-of-isle-of-man.html |title=The Ogham Stones of the Isle of Man |publisher=BabelStone |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111042420/http://babelstone.blogspot.ie/2011/06/ogham-stones-of-isle-of-man.html |archive-date=11 November 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>]]\n[[File:Illiam Dhone.JPG|right|thumb|200px|William Christian, better known as [[Illiam Dhone]] (Brown-haired William)]]\n[[File:Lag ny Keeilley, West slope of Cronk ny Arrey Laa - geograph.org.uk - 181312.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Lag ny Keeilley'' (''Hollow of the Church'') on [[Cronk ny Arrey Laa]] (Hill of the Day Watch). The Manx language has had a substantial influence on the island's [[toponymy]] and nomenclature.]]\n\nManx is a [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] language, closely related to [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]]. On the whole it is partially mutually intelligible with these, and native speakers of one find it easy to gain passive, and even spoken, competency in the other two.\n\nThe earliest known language of the Isle of Man was a form of [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] (like modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]], Cornish and Breton). However, the basis of the modern Manx language is [[Primitive Irish]] (like modern Irish and [[Scottish Gaelic]]). The island lends its name to ''[[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir|Manann\u00e1n]]'', the Brythonic and Gaelic sea god who is said in myth to have once ruled the island. Primitive Irish is first attested in [[Ogham]] inscriptions from the 4th century AD. These writings have been found throughout Ireland and the west coast of [[Great Britain]]. Primitive Irish transitioned into [[Old Irish]] through the 5th century. Old Irish, dating from the 6th century, used the [[Latin script]] and is attested primarily in [[marginalia]] to Latin manuscripts, but there are no extant examples from the Isle of Man.\n\nOn the Isle of Man, the transition from Manx Brythonic to Old Irish (or [[Manx Gaelic]]) may have been gradual and appears to have occurred after speakers of Primitive Irish [[History of the Isle of Man|settled on the Isle of Man]], in large numbers, from about the 5th century AD. Their influence is evident in a change of language in Ogham inscriptions on Man.\n\nIt is possible that Old Irish did not survive the conquest and domination of the island by [[Norse language|Norse]]-speaking Vikings, so that modern Manx language may represent a later, revived form (derived from [[Middle Irish]]). During the 8th century AD, the Isle of Man, like the people in coastal areas of Scotland and Ireland, was significantly influenced by Norse speakers. While Norse had very little impact on the Manx language overall,<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Language death in the Isle of Man : an investigation into the decline and extinction of Manx Gaelic as a community language in the Isle of Man|last=George.|first=Broderick|date=1999|publisher=Niemeyer|isbn=9783110911411|oclc=300505991}}</ref> its legacy in Manx includes loanwords, personal names, and place names such as [[Laxey]] (Laksaa) and [[Ramsey, Isle of Man|Ramsey]] (Rhumsaa).\n\nBy the 10th century, Middle Irish had emerged and was spoken throughout Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man.\n\nDuring the later Middle Ages, the Isle of Man fell increasingly under the influence of England, and from then on the [[English language]] has been the chief external factor in the development of Manx. Beginning in 1405, Manx experienced even more English influence under the rule of Sir John Stanley. As contact between Manx speakers and Gaelic speakers from Scotland and Ireland declined, the language diverged further from its related neighbours.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn the 17th century, some university students left the Isle of Man to attend school in England. At the same time, teaching in English was required in schools founded by governor Isaac Barrow. Barrow also promoted the use of English in churches; he considered that it was a superior language for reading the Bible; however, because the majority of ministers were monolingual Manx speakers, his views had little practical impact.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThomas Wilson began his tenure as Bishop of Mann in 1698 and was succeeded by Mark Hildesley. Both men held positive views of Manx; Wilson was the first person to publish a book in Manx, a translation of ''The Principles and Duties of Christianity'' (''Coyrie Sodjey''), and Hildesley successfully promoted the use of Manx as the language of instruction in schools. The New Testament was first published in Manx in 1767.  In the late 18th century, nearly every school was teaching in English. This decline continued into the 19th century, as English gradually became the primary language spoken on the Isle of Man.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1848, J.&nbsp;G. Cumming wrote, \"there are ... few persons (perhaps none of the young) who speak no English.\" [[Henry Jenner]] estimated in 1874 that about 30% of the population habitually spoke Manx (12,340 out of a population of 41,084). According to official census figures, 9.1% of the population claimed to speak Manx in 1901; in 1921 the percentage was only 1.1%.<ref>Gunther 1990, 59\u201360</ref> Since the language was used by so few people, it had low linguistic \"[[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]]\", and parents tended to not teach Manx to their children, thinking it would be useless to them compared with English.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Revival==\nFollowing the decline in the use of Manx during the nineteenth century, {{lang|gv|[[Manx Gaelic Society|Yn \u00c7heshaght Ghailckagh]]}} (The Manx Language Society) was founded in 1899.  By the middle of the twentieth century, only a few elderly [[native speaker]]s remained (the last of them, [[Ned Maddrell]], died on 27 December 1974), but by then a scholarly revival had begun and a few people had started teaching it in schools.  The Manx Language Unit was formed in 1992, consisting of three members and headed by Manx Language Officer [[Brian Stowell]], a language enthusiast and fluent speaker, \"which was put in charge of all aspects of Manx language teaching and accreditation in schools.\"<ref name=\":1\">Ager, Simon. \"A Study of Language Death and Revival with a Particular Focus on Manx Gaelic.\" Master's Dissertation University of Wales, Lampeter, 2009. PDF.</ref> This led to an increased interest in studying the Manx language and encouraged a renewed sense of ethnic identity. The revival of Manx has been aided by the recording work done in the twentieth century by researchers. Most notably, the [[Irish Folklore Commission]] was sent in with recording equipment in 1948 by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]. Also important in preserving the Manx language was work conducted by the late Brian Stowell, who is considered personally responsible for the current revival of the Manx language.<ref name=graun /> The Manx Language Strategy was released in 2017, outlining a five-year plan for the language's continued revitalisation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.im/news/2017/dec/01/five-year-strategy-salutes-and-celebrates-manx-language/|title=Isle of Man Government - Five year strategy salutes and celebrates Manx language|website=www.gov.im|language=en-GB|access-date=6 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theworldweekly.com/reader/view/magazine/2018-01-04/lifelines-for-indigenous-languages/10437|title=Lifelines for indigenous languages {{!}} The World Weekly|website=www.theworldweekly.com|access-date=6 January 2018}}</ref> [[Culture Vannin]] employs a Manx Language Development Officer (Manx: ''Yn [[Greinneyder]]'') to encourage and facilitate the use of the language.\n\nIn 2009, [[UNESCO]]'s [[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]] declared Manx an [[extinct language]], despite the presence of hundreds of speakers on the Isle of Man.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/isle_of_man/7901763.stm |title=UN declares Manx Gaelic 'extinct' |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=20 February 2009 |website=[[bbc.co.uk]] |access-date=4 April 2015}}</ref> Since then, UNESCO's classification of the language has changed to \"critically endangered\".<ref name=graun>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/apr/02/how-manx-language-came-back-from-dead-isle-of-man |title=How the Manx language came back from the dead |last1=Whitehead |first1=Sarah |date=2 April 2015 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=4 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2011 census, 1,823 out of 80,398 Isle of Man residents, or 2.27% of the population, claimed to have knowledge of Manx,<ref name=Gov.im>[http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/treasury/economic/census/census2011reportfinalresized.pdf Isle of Man Census Report 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108113021/http://www.gov.im/lib/docs/treasury/economic/census/census2011reportfinalresized.pdf |date=8 November 2012 }}.</ref> an increase of 134 people from the 2001 census.<ref>{{cite news|title=Manx Gaelic Revival 'Impressive'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/isle_of_man/4271840.stm|work=BBC News|date=22 September 2005}}</ref> These were spread roughly uniformly over the island: in [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] 566 people professed an ability to speak, read or write Manx; 179 in [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]], 146 in [[Onchan]], and 149 in Ramsey.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nTraditional Manx given names are once again becoming common on the island, especially ''Moirrey'' and ''Voirrey'' (Mary, properly pronounced similarly to the Scottish ''Moira'', but often mispronounced as ''Moiree/Voiree'' when used as a given name by non-Manx speakers), ''Illiam'' ([[William (name)|William]]), ''Orry'' (from the Manx king [[Godred Crovan]] of Norse origin), ''Breeshey'' (also ''Breesha'') ([[Bridget (given name)|Bridget]]), ''Aalish'' (also ''Ealish'') ([[Alice (given name)|Alice]]), ''Juan'' ([[Jack (name)|Jack]]), ''Ean'' (Ian), ''Joney'' ([[John (name)|John]]), ''Fenella'' ([[Fionnuala]]), ''Pherick'' ([[Patrick (given name)|Patrick]]) and ''Freya'' (from the [[Freyja|Norse goddess]]) remain popular.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n== Number of speakers by year ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Year\n! colspan=2 | Manx speakers\n! rowspan=2 | Manx <br/>population\n|-\n!

By that time, any presumed literary link with Ireland and Scotland, such as through Irish-trained priests, had been lost. The first published literature in Manx was ''The Principles and Duties of Christianity (Coyrie Sodjey)'', translated by [[Bishop of Man]] [[Thomas Wilson (bishop)|Thomas Wilson]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe [[Book of Common Prayer]] was translated by [[John Philips (bishop)|John Phillips]], the Welsh-born [[Bishop of Sodor and Man]] (1605\u201333). The early Manx script has some similarities with orthographical systems found occasionally in Scotland and in Ireland for the transliteration of Gaelic, such as the [[Book of the Dean of Lismore]], as well as some extensive texts based on English and Scottish English orthographical practices of the time. Little secular [[Manx literature]] has been preserved.\n\nThe New Testament was first published in 1767. When the [[Anglican church]] authorities started to produce written literature in the Manx language in the 18th century, the system developed by John Philips was further \"anglicised\"; the one feature retained from Welsh orthography was the use of {{angle bracket|y}} to represent [[schwa]] (e.g. {{lang|gv|cabbyl}} {{IPA|[ka\u02d0\u03b2\u0259l]}} \"horse\" and {{lang|gv|cooney}} {{IPA|[ku\u02d0n\u0259]}} \"help\" as well as {{IPA|/\u026a/}} (e.g. {{lang|gv|fys}} {{IPA|[f\u026az]}} \"knowledge\"), though it is also used to represent {{IPA|[j]}}, as in English (e.g. {{lang|gv|y Yuan}} {{IPA|[\u0259 ju\u02d0an]}} \"John\" (vocative), {{lang|gv|yeeast}} {{IPA|[ji\u02d0\u0259st]}} \"fish\").\n\nOther works produced in the 18th and 19th century include catechisms, hymn books and religious tracts. A translation of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' was made in 1796.\n\nA considerable amount of secular literature has been produced in the 20th and 21st centuries as part of the language revival. In 2006, the first full-length novel in Manx, ''Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley'' (''The Vampire Murders'') was published by Brian Stowell, after being serialised in the press. There is an increasing amount of literature available in the language, and recent publications include Manx versions of the ''Gruffalo'' and ''Gruffalo's Child''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturevannin.im/cms/publication_type_index_1475.html |title=Books - Lioaryn &#124; Culture Vannin &#124; Isle of Man |website=Culturevannin.im |accessdate=25 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 [[Rob Teare]] translated [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]]'s ''[[The Little Prince]]'' in Manx.<ref>[https://petit-prince-collection.com/lang/show_livre.php?lang=en&id=5326 Little Prince nr.

Wilson set to work to remedy the defect, and, with the assistance of some of his clergy, managed to get some of the Bible translated, and the Gospel of St. Matthew printed. Bishop Hildesley, his successor, with the help of the whole body of Manx clergy, completed the work, and in 1775 the whole Bible was printed.''<ref name=\"isle-of-man.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/history/manks/jenner.htm |title=Henry Jenner - The Manx Language, 1875 |publisher=Isle-of-man.com |accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Bible was first produced in Manx by a group of Anglican clergymen on the island. The Gospel of Matthew was printed in 1748. The four Gospels were produced in 1763 and ''Conaant Noa nyn Jiarn as Saualtagh Yeesey Creest'' (the [[New Testament]] of our Lord & Saviour Jesus Christ) in 1767 by the [[Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge]] (SPCK). In 1772 the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew and printed, together with the Books of [[Wisdom of Solomon]] and [[Ecclesiasticus]] (Sirach) from the [[Apocrypha]]. ''Yn Vible Casherick'' (The Holy Bible) of the Old and New Testaments was published as one book by the SPCK in 1775. The bicentenary was celebrated on the Isle of Man in 1975 and included a set of stamps from the Isle of Man Post Office.\n\nThis 1775 edition effectively fixed the modern orthography of Manx Gaelic, which has changed little since. Jenner claims that some [[bowdlerisation]] had occurred in the translation, e.g. the occupation of [[Rahab]] the prostitute is rendered as ''ben-oast'',{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} a hostess or female inn-keeper.<ref name=\"isle-of-man.com\"/>\n\nThere was a translation of the ''Psalmyn Ghavid'' (Psalms of David) in metre in Manx by the Rev John Clague, vicar of Rushen, which was printed with the [[Book of Common Prayer]] of 1768. Bishop Hildesley required that these [[Metrical Psalms]] were to be sung in churches. These were reprinted by the [[Manx Language Society]] in 1905.\n\nThe [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] (BFBS) published the Conaant Noa (New Testament) in 1810 and reprinted it in 1824. ''Yn Vible Casherick'' (the Holy Bible) of the Old Testament and New Testament (without the two books of the Apocrypha) was first printed as a whole in 1819. BFBS last printed anything on paper in Manx in 1936 when it reprinted ''Noo Ean'' (the Gospel of St John); this was reprinted by [[Manx Gaelic Society|Yn \u00c7heshaght Ghailckagh]] (The Manx Gaelic Society) in 1968. The Manx Bible was republished by Shearwater Press in July 1979 as ''Bible Chasherick yn Lught Thie'' (Manx Family Bible), which was a reproduction of the BFBS 1819 Bible.\n\nSince 2014 the BFBS 1936 Manx Gospel of John has been available online on YouVersion and Bibles.org.\n\n===Church===\nManx was used in some churches into the late 19th century.<ref name=\"isle-of-man.com\"/> Although church services in Manx were once fairly common, they occur infrequently now. Yn \u00c7heshaght Ghailckagh, the Manx Language Society, hold an annual [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY9VF_bkZsw Christmas service] at locations around the island.\n\n==Classification and dialects==\nManx is one of the three descendants of [[Old Irish]] (via [[Middle Irish]] and early Modern Gaelic), and is closely related to [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]]. It shares a number of developments in phonology, vocabulary and grammar with Irish and Scottish Gaelic (in some cases only with dialects of these) and shows a number of unique changes. There are two attested historical dialects of Manx, Northern Manx and Southern Manx.<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:xxvii\u2013xxviii, 160</ref> A third dialect may have existed in-between, around Douglas.\n\nManx shares with Scottish Gaelic the partial loss of contrastive [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalisation]] of [[labial consonant]]s; thus while in Irish the velarised consonants {{IPA|/p\u02e0 b\u02e0 f\u02e0 w m\u02e0/}} contrast [[phonemic]]ally with palatalised {{IPA|/p\u02b2 b\u02b2 f\u02b2 v\u02b2 m\u02b2/}}, in Scottish Gaelic and Manx, the phonemic contrast has been lost to some extent.<ref>Jackson 1955, 66. Jackson claims that northern Irish has also lost the contrast between velarised and palatalised labials, but this seems to be a mistake on his part, as both [[County Mayo|Mayo]] Irish and Ulster Irish are consistently described as having the contrast (cf. Mhac an Fhailigh 1968, 27; Hughes 1994, 621; see also \u00d3 Baoill 1978, 87)</ref> A consequence of this [[phonemic merger]] is that Middle Irish unstressed word-final {{IPA|[\u0259\u03b2\u02b2]}} (spelled ''-(a)ibh'', ''-(a)imh'' in Irish and Gaelic) has merged with {{IPA|[\u0259\u03b2]}} (''-(e)abh'', ''-(e)amh'') in Manx; both have become {{IPA|[u]}}, spelled ''-oo'' or ''-u(e)''. Examples include {{lang|gv|shassoo}} (\"to stand\"; Irish {{lang|ga|seasamh}}), {{lang|gv|credjue}} (\"religion\"; Irish {{lang|ga|creideamh}}), {{lang|gv|nealloo}} (\"fainting\"; Early Modern Irish {{lang|ga|(i) n\u00e9alaibh}}, lit. ''in clouds''), and {{lang|gv|erriu}} (\"on you (plural)\"; Irish {{lang|ga|oraibh}}).<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 77\u201382; Broderick 1984\u201386, 2:152</ref>\n\nMedial and final *bh and *mh have become {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} in general in Manx, thus ''shiu'' 'you PL', Scottish and Irish Gaelic ''sibh'' (''siph'' in Northern Irish, ''sib'' in South Connacht Irish; Lewis G\u00e0idhlig has the variant ''si\u00f9'', besides the more general ''sibh''), -bh in final consonant clusters, e.g. Manx ''sharroo'' 'bitter', Scottish ''searbh'' {{IPA|/\u0283\u00e6rav/}}, Northern and Western Irish ''searbh'' {{IPA|/\u0283\u00e6ru/}}, Southern Irish ''searbh'' {{IPA|/\u0283\u00e6r\u0259\u03b2/}}, between vowels, e.g. Manx ''awin'' 'river' , Scottish ''abhainn'' {{IPA|/avi\u0272/}}, Irish ''abhainn'' {{IPA|/aun\u02b2/}}, word-finally in monosyllables, e.g. Manx ''laaue'' 'hand', Scottish ''l\u00e0mh'' {{IPA|/la:v/}}, Northern Irish {{IPA|/l\u00e6:w/}}, Western Irish ''l\u00e1mh'' {{IPA|/l\u0251:w/}}, Southern Irish {{IPA|/l\u0251:\u03b2/}}, at the end of stressed syllables (see further below), as in ''sourey'' 'summer', Scotland and Ireland ''samhradh'', Scottish {{IPA|/saur\u0259\u0263/}}, Northern Irish {{IPA|/sauru/}}, Western and Southern Irish {{IPA|/saur\u0259/}}. In all this Manx is most like Northern Irish. Rare retentions of the older pronunciation of \"bh\" include ''Divlyn'', ''Divlin'' 'Dublin', Middle Irish ''Duibhlinn'' {{IPA|/d\u032au\u03b2\u02b2l\u02b2in\u02b2:/}}, also written ''Duibhlinn'' in Modern Irish and Scots Gaelic.\n\nMoreover, similarly to [[Munster Irish]], historical ''bh'' {{IPA|[\u03b2\u02b2]}} and ''mh'' (nasalised {{IPA|[\u03b2\u02b2]}}) tend to be lost in the middle or at the end of a word in Manx, either with [[compensatory lengthening]] or vocalisation as '''u''' resulting in [[diphthong]]isation with the preceding vowel. For example, Manx {{lang|gv|geurey}} (\"winter\") {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261\u02b2eur\u0259], [\u02c8\u0261\u02b2u\u02d0r\u0259]}} and {{lang|gv|sleityn}} (\"mountains\") {{IPA|[\u02c8sle\u02d0d\u0292\u0259n]}} correspond to Irish {{lang|ga|geimhreadh}} and {{lang|ga|sl\u00e9ibhte}} (Southern Irish dialect spelling and pronunciation ''g\u00edre'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u025fi\u02d0\u027e\u02b2\u0259]}}) and ''sl\u00e9te'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283l\u02b2e\u02d0t\u02b2\u0259]}})).<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 24; Broderick 1984\u201386 3:80\u201383; \u00d3 S\u00e9 2000:15, 120</ref> Another similarity to Munster Irish is the development of the Old Irish diphthongs {{IPA|[oi ai]}} before [[velarised]] consonants (spelled ''ao'' in Irish and Scottish Gaelic) to {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} in many words, as in {{lang|gv|seyr}} (\"carpenter\") {{IPA|[se\u02d0r]}} and {{lang|gv|keyl}} (\"narrow\") {{IPA|[ke\u02d0l]}} (spelled {{lang|ga|saor}} and {{lang|ga|caol}} in Irish and Scottish, and pronounced virtually the same in Munster).<ref>Jackson 1955, 47\u201350; \u00d3 Cu\u00edv 1944, 38, 91</ref>\n\nLike western and northern dialects of Irish (cf. [[Irish phonology#Word-initial consonant clusters|Irish phonology]]) and most dialects of Scottish Gaelic, Manx has changed the historical [[consonant cluster]]s {{IPA|/kn \u0261n mn tn/}} to {{IPA|/kr \u0261r mr tr/}}. For example, Middle Irish {{lang|mga|cn\u00e1id}} (\"mockery\") and {{lang|mga|mn\u00e1}} (\"women\") have become {{lang|gv|craid}} and {{lang|gv|mraane}} respectively in Manx.<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 22</ref> The [[affrication]] of {{IPA|[t\u032a\u02b2 d\u032a\u02b2]}} to {{IPA|[t\u0283 d\u0292]}} is also common to Manx, northern Irish, and Scottish Gaelic.<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 203</ref>\n\nAlso like northern and western dialects of Irish, as well as like southern dialects of Scottish Gaelic (e.g. [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Kintyre]]), the unstressed word-final syllable {{IPA|[i\u029d]}} of Middle Irish (spelled ''-(a)idh'' and ''-(a)igh'') has developed to {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} in Manx, where it is spelled ''-ee'', as in {{lang|gv|kionnee}} (\"buy\"; cf. Irish {{lang|ga|ceannaigh}}) and {{lang|gv|cullee}} (\"apparatus\"; cf. Gaelic {{lang|gd|culaidh}}).<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 57</ref>\n\nAnother property Manx shares with Ulster Irish and some dialects of Scottish Gaelic is that {{IPA|/a/}} rather than {{IPA|/\u0259/}} appears in unstressed syllables before {{IPA|/x/}} (in Manx spelling, ''agh''), for example {{lang|gv|jeeragh}} (\"straight\") {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0292i\u02d0rax]}} (Irish {{lang|ga|d\u00edreach}}), {{lang|gv|cooinaghtyn}} (\"to remember\") {{IPA|[\u02c8ku\u02d0n\u02b2axt\u032a\u0259n]}} (Gaelic {{lang|gd|cuimhneachd}}).<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 110; Jackson 1955, 55</ref>\n\nLike southern and western varieties of Irish and northern varieties of Scottish Gaelic, but unlike the geographically closer varieties of [[Ulster Irish]] and Arran and Kintyre Gaelic, Manx shows vowel lengthening or diphthongisation before the Old Irish [[Irish phonology#Fortis and lenis sonorants|fortis and lenis sonorants]]. For example, {{lang|gv|cloan}} (\"children\") {{IPA|[kl\u0254\u02d0n]}}, {{lang|gv|dhone}} (\"brown\") {{IPA|[d\u032ao\u02d0n]}}, {{lang|gv|eeym}} (\"butter\") {{IPA|[i\u02d0\u1d47m]}} correspond to Irish/Scottish Gaelic {{lang|ga|clann}}, {{lang|ga|donn}}, and {{lang|ga|im}} respectively, which have long vowels or diphthongs in western and southern Irish and in the Scottish Gaelic dialects of the [[Outer Hebrides]] and [[Skye]], thus western Irish {{IPA|[kl\u02e0\u0251\u02d0n\u032a\u02e0]}}, Southern Irish/Northern Scottish {{IPA|[kl\u032a\u02e0aun\u032a\u02e0]}}, {{IPA|[d\u032a\u02e0aun\u032a\u02e0]/[d\u032a\u02e0oun\u032a\u02e0]}}, {{IPA|[i\u02d0m]/[\u0264im]}}), but short vowels and 'long' consonants in northern Irish, Arran, and Kintyre, {{IPA|[kl\u032a\u02e0an\u032a\u02d0\u02e0]}}, {{IPA|[d\u032a\u02e0on\u032a\u02d0\u02e0]}} and {{IPA|[im\u02b2\u02d0]}}.<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 51; Jackson 1955, 57\u201358; Holmer 1957, 87, 88, 106; 1962, 41</ref>\n\nAnother similarity with southern Irish is the treatment of Middle Irish word-final unstressed {{IPA|[\u0259\u00f0]}}, spelled ''-(e)adh'' in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. In nouns (including [[verbal noun]]s), this became {{IPA|[\u0259]}} in Manx, as it did in southern Irish, e.g. {{lang|gv|caggey}} (\"war\") {{IPA|[\u02c8ka\u02d0\u0263\u0259]}}, {{lang|gv|moylley}} (\"to praise\") {{IPA|[\u02c8m\u0254l\u0259]}}; cf.

Irish {{lang|ga|mholfadh}}, pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8\u03b2\u02e0\u0254l\u032a\u02e0h\u0259x]}} in southern Irish.<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 75</ref>\n\n[[File:Manx dialects.png|thumb|left|Dialect map of Manx (boundaries are approximate)]]\nLinguistic analysis of the last few dozen native speakers reveals a number of dialectal differences between the northern and the southern parts of the island. Northern Manx was reflected by speakers from towns and villages from [[Maughold]] in the northeast of the island to [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]] on the west coast. Southern Manx was used by speakers from the [[sheading]] of [[Rushen]]. It is possible that written Manx represents a 'midlands' dialect of Douglas and surrounding areas.\n\nIn Southern Manx, older ''\u00e1'' and in some cases ''\u00f3'' became {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0]}}. In Northern Manx the same happened, but ''\u00e1'' sometimes remained {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}} as well. For example, {{lang|gv|laa}} (\"day\", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|l\u00e1}}) was {{IPA|[l\u00e6\u02d0]}} in the south but {{IPA|[l\u00e6\u02d0]}} or {{IPA|[la\u02d0]}} in the north. Old ''\u00f3'' is always {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0]}} in both dialects, e.g. {{lang|gv|aeg}} (\"young\", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|\u00f3g}}) is {{IPA|[\u00e6\u02d0\u0261]}} in both dialects.<ref>Broderick 1984\u20138,6 1:160</ref> In many words before ''rt'', ''rd'' and ''rg'', and in one or two other words ''\u00e1'', lengthened ''a'' and ''\u00f3'' have become /\u0153:/, as in ''paayrt'' 'part' /p\u0153:rt/, ''ard'' 'high' /\u0153:rd/, ''jiarg'' 'red' /d\u0292\u0153:rg/, ''argid'' 'money, silver' /\u0153:rgid/ and ''aarey'' 'gold GEN' /\u0153:r\u0259/.\n\nIn Northern Manx, older ''(e)a'' before ''nn'' in the same syllable is diphthongised, while in Southern Manx it is lengthened but remains a [[monophthong]]. For example, {{lang|gv|kione}} (\"head\", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|ceann}}) is {{IPA|[k\u02b2aun]}} in the north but {{IPA|[k\u02b2o\u02d0n]}} in the south.<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:161</ref>\n\nWords with ''ua'' and in some cases ''ao'' in Irish and Scottish are spelled with ''eay'' in Manx. In Northern Manx, this sound was {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}}, while in Southern Manx it was {{IPA|[\u026f\u02d0]}}, {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}}, or {{IPA|[y\u02d0]}}. For example, {{lang|gv|geay}} (\"wind\", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|gaoth}}) is {{IPA|[\u0261i\u02d0]}} in the north and {{IPA|[\u0261\u026f\u02d0]}} in the south, while {{lang|gv|geayl}} (\"coal\", cf. Irish {{lang|ga|gual}}) is {{IPA|[\u0261i\u02d0l]}} in the north and {{IPA|[\u0261y\u02d0l]}}, {{IPA|[\u0261\u026f\u02d0l]}}, or {{IPA|[\u0261u\u02d0l]}} in the south.<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:161\u201362</ref>\n\nIn both the north and the south, there is a tendency to insert a short {{IPA|[d]}} sound before a word-final {{IPA|[n]}} in monosyllabic words, as in {{IPA|[sle\u1d48n]}} for {{lang|gv|slane}} (\"whole\") and {{IPA|[be\u1d48n]}} for {{lang|gv|ben}} (\"woman\"). This phenomenon is known as [[pre-occlusion]]. In Southern Manx, however, there is pre-occlusion of {{IPA|[d]}} before {{IPA|[l]}} and of {{IPA|[\u0261]}} before {{IPA|[\u014b]}}, as in {{IPA|[\u0283u\u02d0\u1d48l]}} for {{lang|gv|shooyl}} (\"walking\") and {{IPA|[l\u0254\u1da2\u014b]}} for {{lang|gv|lhong}} (\"ship\"). These forms are generally pronounced without pre-occlusion in the north. Preocclusion of {{IPA|[b]}} before {{IPA|[m]}}, on the other hand, is more common in the north, as in {{lang|gv|trome}} (\"heavy\"), which is {{IPA|[t\u032aro\u1d47m]}} in the north but {{IPA|[t\u032aro\u02d0m]}} or {{IPA|[t\u032aro\u02d0\u1d47m]}} in the south.<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:162\u201363</ref> This feature is also found in [[Cornish language|Cornish]].\n\nSouthern Manx tended to lose word-initial {{IPA|[\u0261]}} before {{IPA|[l\u02b2]}}, while Northern Manx usually preserved it, e.g. {{lang|gv|glion}} (\"glen\") is {{IPA|[\u0261l\u02b2\u0254\u1d48n]}} in the north and {{IPA|[l\u02b2\u0254\u1d48n]}} in the south, and {{lang|gv|glioon}} (\"knee\") is {{IPA|[\u0261l\u02b2u\u02d0n]}} in the north and {{IPA|[l\u02b2u\u02d0\u1d48n]}} in the south.<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:164\u201365</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Phrases==\nSome simple conversational words and phrases:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=300pt|English (Baarle) !!

[[Classical Irish]], which was the language of the educated Gaelic elite of both Ireland and Scotland (where it is called [[Classical Gaelic]]) until the mid-19th century. In general, these orthographies retain spelling and derivation from older Gaelic, which means that there is not in a one-to-one system. Both systems use only 18 letters to represent around 50 phonemes. While Manx in effect uses the English spelling system, except for {{angle bracket|x}} and {{angle bracket|z}}, the 24 letters used in its orthography likewise covers a similar range of phonemes, and therefore many digraphs and trigraphs are used.\n\nThe Manx orthography was developed by people who were unaware of traditional Gaelic orthography, as they had learned literacy in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and English (the initial development in the 16th century), then only English (later developments). Therefore, the orthography is based on early Modern English pronunciation, and to a small extent Welsh, rather than from a pan-Gaelic point of view.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Kelly|1870|p=xiii}} footnote in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NZENAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR13 Spoken Sound as a Rule for Orthography]'', credited to W. Mackenzie.</ref> The result is an inconsistent and only partially phonemic spelling system, in a similar way as spelling in English. [[T.&nbsp;F. O'Rahilly]] expressed the opinion that Gaelic in the Isle of Man was saddled with an inadequate spelling which is neither traditional nor phonetic; if the traditional Gaelic orthography had been preserved, the close kinship that exists between Manx Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic would be obvious to all at first sight.<ref>O'Rahilly 1932, 128</ref>\n\nThere is no evidence of [[Gaelic type|Gaelic script]] having been used on the island.\n\n===Cedilla===\nManx uses relatively few [[diacritic]]s, but a [[cedilla]] is often (but not exclusively) used to differentiate between the two pronunciations of ''ch'':\n* ''\u00c7hiarn'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0361\u0283a\u02d0rn/}}), meaning ''lord'', is pronounced with the [[voiceless palato-alveolar affricate|palato-alveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}, as in the English \"'''ch'''urch\"\n* ''Chamoo'' ({{IPA|/xa\u02c8mu/}}), meaning ''nor'' or ''neither'', is pronounced with the [[voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]] {{IPA|/x/}}, as in the [[Standard Scottish English|Scottish]] pronunciation of the word \"lo'''ch'''\" ({{IPA|/\u02c8l\u0252x/}}), a sound which is commonly represented by ''gh'' at the ends of words in Manx (as it often is in the English of Ireland).\n\n===Examples===\nThe following examples are taken from Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:178\u201379 and 1:350\u201353. The first example is from a speaker of Northern Manx, the second from [[Ned Maddrell]], a speaker of Southern Manx.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Orthography\n!Phonetic transcription\n!Gloss\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|V'ad smooinaghtyn dy beagh cabbyl jeeaghyn skee as deinagh ayns y voghree dy beagh eh er ve ec ny ferrishyn fud ny h-oie as beagh ad cur lesh yn saggyrt dy cur e vannaght er.}}\n|{{IPA|vod\u032a \u02c8smu\u02d0n\u02b2axt\u032a\u0259n d\u032a\u0259 bi\u0259x \u02c8ka\u02d0b\u0259l d\u0292i\u02d0\u0259n ski\u02d0 as \u02c8d\u032a\u00f8in\u02b2ax uns \u0259 \u02c8vo\u02d0x\u0259ri d\u032a\u0259 bi\u0259x e er vi ek n\u0259 \u02c8feri\u0283\u0259n fod\u032a n\u0259 h\u00f8i as bi\u0259x \u0259d\u032a k\u00f8r le\u0283 \u0259n \u02c8sa\u02d0\u0261\u0259rt\u032a d\u032a\u0259 k\u00f8r \u0259 \u02c8vanax er}}\n|They used to think if a horse was looking tired and weary in the morning then it had been with the fairies all night and they would bring the priest to put his blessing on it.\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|Va ben aynshoh yn \u00e7hiaghtin chaie as v'ee laccal mish dy ynsagh ee dy gra yn Padjer yn \u00c7hiarn.

Nouns are inflected for [[grammatical number|number]]. The [[plural]] is formed in a variety of ways, most commonly by addition of the suffix {{lang|gv|-yn}} {{IPA|[\u0259n]}}, but also by vowel change, changing {{lang|gv|-agh}} {{IPA|[ax]}} to {{lang|gv|-ee}} {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} or {{lang|gv|-eeghyn}} {{IPA|[i\u02d0\u0259n]}} or by adding other endings. There is usually no inflection for [[grammatical case|case]], except in a minority of nouns that have a distinct genitive singular form, which is formed in various ways. (Most common is the addition of the suffix ''-ey'' {{IPA|[\u0259]}} to feminine nouns.) Historical genitive singulars are often encountered in [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] even when they are no longer [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] forms; for example {{lang|gv|thie-ollee}} \"cowhouse\" uses the old genitive of {{lang|gv|ollagh}} \"cattle\".<ref>Thomson 1992, 118\u201319; Broderick 1993, 239\u201340</ref> There are also traces of a dative singular in set phrases such as {{lang|gv|ry-chosh}} \"on foot\", contrasting with nominative {{lang|gv|cass}} and genitive {{lang|gv|coshey}} (cf. {{lang|gv|cullee choshey}} \"footwear\", {{lang|gv|bluckan coshey}} \"football, soccer, rugby\").<ref>{{Cite book|title=First Lessons in Manx|last=Goodwin|first=Edmund|last2=Thomson|first2=Robert|publisher=Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh|year=1966|page=50}}</ref>\n\n=== Adjectives ===\nCertain adjectives have plural as well as singular forms (through the addition ''-ey'' {{IPA|[\u0259]}}), although the use of the singular adjective with a plural noun is usual. Most adjectives end in ''-agh'' {{IPA|[ax]}} and form their [[comparative]]/[[superlative]] form by replacing this with ''-ee'' {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}}, e.g. ''at\u00e7himagh'' \"terrible\" becomes ''at\u00e7himee'', giving ''ny s'at\u00e7himee'' \"more terrible\" and ''s'at\u00e7himee'' \"most terrible\". As in Irish and Scottish Gaelic, the comparative-superlative is commonly marked by the copula verb ''s'' (''is'') in the present, and ''by'' in the past; the superlative is often shown by the word \"nys\" /nis/, from Middle Irish ''n\u00ed as'' \"thing that is\" (cf. Irish ''n\u00edos'', past ''n\u00ed ba'').<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conversational Manx|last=Gell|first=John|publisher=Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh|year=1989|isbn=1870029100|location=St. Judes|page=34}}</ref> A number of adjectives form their comparative/superlative irregularly:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Irregular comparative/superlative forms of Manx adjectives\n!Positive\n!English\n!Comparative/Superlative\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|aalin}}\n|beautiful\n|{{lang|gv|aaley}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|aashag}}\n|easy\n|{{lang|gv|assey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|aeg}}\n|young\n|{{lang|gv|aa}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|ard}}\n|high\n|{{lang|gv|yrjey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|beg}}\n|small\n|{{lang|gv|loo}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|bog}}\n|soft, moist\n|{{lang|gv|buiggey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|bwaagh}}\n|pretty\n|{{lang|gv|bwaaie}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|\u00e7heh}}\n|hot\n|{{lang|gv|\u00e7hoe}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|\u00e7hionn}}\n|tight, fast\n|{{lang|gv|\u00e7henney}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|\u00e7hiu}}\n|thick\n|{{lang|gv|\u00e7hee}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|faggys}}\n|near\n|{{lang|gv|niessey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|foddey}}\n|far, long\n|{{lang|gv|odjey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|garroo}}\n|rough\n|{{lang|gv|girroo}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|gial}}\n|bright, white\n|{{lang|gv|gilley}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|giare}}\n|short\n|{{lang|gv|girrey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|lajer}}\n|strong\n|{{lang|gv|troshey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|leah}}\n|soon\n|{{lang|gv|leaie}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|lheann}}\n|wide\n|{{lang|gv|lea}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|liauyr}}\n|long, tall\n|{{lang|gv|lhiurey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|mie}}\n|good\n|{{lang|gv|share}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|moal}}\n|slow\n|{{lang|gv|melley}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|mooar}}\n|large, big\n|{{lang|gv|moo}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|olk}}\n|bad, evil\n|{{lang|gv|messey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|reagh}}\n|merry, lively\n|{{lang|gv|reaie}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|roauyr}}\n|fat, broad\n|{{lang|gv|riurey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|shenn}}\n|old\n|{{lang|gv|shinney}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|thanney}}\n|thin\n|{{lang|gv|theinney}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|trome}}\n|heavy\n|{{lang|gv|thrimmey}}\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|ymmodee}}\n|many\n|{{lang|gv|lee}}\n|}\nThe comparative/superlative can also be formed using {{lang|gv|smoo}} \"more\" with the positive form e.g. {{lang|gv|s'thrimmey}} = {{lang|gv|smoo trome}}.\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nIn common with Irish and Scottish Gaelic, in addition to its regular personal pronouns, Manx has also a series used for emphasis. Under certain phonological circumstances, these can be used as unemphatic pronouns, e.g. \"you were not\" is {{lang|gv|cha row uss}} {{IPA|[xa \u02c8rau \u028as]}} as {{lang|gv|cha row oo}} {{IPA|[xa \u02c8rau u(\u02d0)]}} sounds too similar to {{lang|gv|cha row}} {{IPA|[xa \u02c8rau]}} \"they/he/she was not\".\n\nNotice the only difference between the masculine and feminine third person singular possessive pronouns is the [[Consonant mutation|initial sound change]], namely lenition and h-prefixing, they cause, e.g. {{lang|gv|e glioonag}} \"her laptop\", {{lang|gv|e ghlioonag}} \"his laptop\", ''e ooh'' \"his egg\", ''e hooh'' \"her egg\".\n\nAn alternative to using the possessive pronouns is to precede a noun with the definite article and follow it with the inflected form of {{lang|gv|ec}} \"at\" to show the person, e.g. {{lang|gv|yn thie aym}} \"my house\" (literally \"the house at me\") instead of {{lang|gv|my hie}} \"my house\". This is especially useful in the plural, where all persons share one possessive pronoun, e.g. {{lang|gv|yn thie oc}} \"their house\", as opposed to {{lang|gv|nyn dhie}} \"our/your/their house\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Manx personal pronouns'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |Person\n!Regular\n!Emphatic\n!Possessive\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | First singular\n|{{lang|gv|mee}}\n|{{lang|gv|mish}}\n|{{lang|gv|my}}<sup>[[Template:Ref label|[1]]]</sup>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Second singular\n|{{lang|gv|oo}}\n|{{lang|gv|uss}}\n|{{lang|gv|dty}}<sup>[[Template:Ref label|[1]]]</sup>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Third singular\n!masculine\n|{{lang|gv|eh}}\n|{{lang|gv|eshyn}}\n|{{lang|gv|e}}<sup>[[Template:Ref label|[1]]]</sup>\n|-\n!feminine\n|{{lang|gv|ee}}\n|{{lang|gv|ish}}\n|{{lang|gv|e}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | First plural\n|{{lang|gv|shin}}\n|{{lang|gv|shinyn}}\n|{{lang|gv|nyn}}<sup>[[Template:Ref label|[2]]]</sup>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Second plural\n|{{lang|gv|shiu}}\n|{{lang|gv|shiuish}}\n|{{lang|gv|nyn}}<sup>[[Template:Ref label|[2]]]</sup>\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Third plural\n|{{lang|gv|ad}}\n|{{lang|gv|adsyn}}\n|{{lang|gv|nyn}}<sup>[[Template:Ref label|[2]]]</sup>\n|}\n\n1.'''[[Template:Ref label|^]]''' Causes lenition.\n\n2.'''[[Template:Ref label|^]]''' Causes eclipsis.\n\n=== Verbs ===\nManx verbs generally form their [[finite verb|finite]] forms by means of [[periphrasis]]: inflected forms of the [[auxiliary verb]]s {{lang|gv|ve}} \"to be\" or {{lang|gv|jannoo}} \"to do\" are combined with the [[verbal noun]] of the main verb.

Independent forms are used when the verb is not preceded by any particle; dependent forms are used when a particle (e.g. {{lang|gv|cha}} \"not\") does precede the verb. For example, \"you will lose\" is {{lang|gv|caillee oo}} with the independent form {{lang|gv|caillee}} (\"will lose\"), while \"you will not lose\" is {{lang|gv|cha gaill oo}} with the dependent form {{lang|gv|caill}} (which has undergone [[#Initial consonant mutations|eclipsis]] to {{lang|gv|gaill}} after {{lang|gv|cha}}).

In this case, only the auxiliary verb precedes the subject, while the verbal noun comes after the subject. The auxiliary verb may be a [[modal verb]] rather than a form of {{lang|gv|bee}} (\"be\") or {{lang|gv|jannoo}} (\"do\"). Particles like the negative {{lang|gv|cha}} (\"not\") precede the inflected verb. Examples:\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n{|\n| {{sm|main<br />verb}}\n| colspan=2 | {{sm|subject}}\n| colspan=2 | {{sm|direct<br />object}}\n|-\n| {{lang|gv|Hug}} || {{lang|gv|yn}} || {{lang|gv|saggyrt}} || {{lang|gv|e}} || {{lang|gv|laue}} || {{lang|gv|urree.}}\n|-\n| put-{{sc|pret}} || the || priest || his || hand || on her\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"The priest put his hand on her.\"<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:181</ref>\n|}\n&nbsp;\n{|\n| {{sm|aux.<br />verb}}\n| colspan=2 | {{sm|subject}}\n| {{sm|main<br />verb}}\n| colspan=2 | {{sm|direct<br />object}}\n|-\n| {{lang|gv|Va}} || {{lang|gv|ny}} || {{lang|gv|eayin}} || {{lang|gv|gee}} || {{lang|gv|yn}} || {{lang|gv|conney.}}\n|-\n| were || the || lambs || eat-{{sc|v.n.}} || the || gorse\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"The lambs used to eat the gorse.\"<ref>Broderick 1984\u201386, 1:179</ref>\n|}\n&nbsp;\n{|\n|  || {{sm|modal<br />verb}} || {{sm|subject}} || {{sm|main<br />verb}} || {{sm|direct<br />object}}\n|-\n| {{lang|gv|Cha}} || {{lang|gv|jarg}} || {{lang|gv|shiu}} || {{lang|gv|fakin}} || {{lang|gv|red erbee.}}\n|-\n| not || can || you-{{sc|pl}} || see-{{sc|v.n.}} || anything\n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"You can't see anything.\"<ref>Broderick 1993, 274</ref>\n|}\n</div>\n\nWhen the auxiliary verb is a form of {{lang|gv|jannoo}} (\"do\"), the direct object precedes the verbal noun and is connected to it with the particle {{lang|gv|y}}:\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n{|\n| {{sm|aux.<br />verb}} || {{sm|subject}}\n| colspan=2 | {{sm|direct<br />object}}\n|  || {{sm|main<br />verb}}\n|-\n| {{lang|gv|Ren}} || {{lang|gv|ad}} || {{lang|gv|my}} || {{lang|gv|choraa}} || {{lang|gv|y}} || {{lang|gv|chlashtyn.}}\n|-\n| did || they || my || voice || {{sc|particle}} || hear-{{sc|v.n.}}\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"They heard my voice.\"<ref name=\"Thoms105\"/>\n|}\n</div>\n\nAs in Irish (cf. [[Irish syntax#The forms meaning \"to be\"]]), there are two ways of expressing \"to be\" in Manx: with the substantive verb {{lang|gv|bee}}, and with the copula. The substantive verb is used when the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] is an adjective, adverb, or [[prepositional phrase]].<ref>Broderick 1993, 276\u201377</ref> Examples:\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|t'}} || {{lang|gv|eh}} || {{lang|gv|agglagh}}\n|-\n| is || it || awful/frightening\n|-\n| colspan=3 | \"It is awful/frightening.\"\n|}\n&nbsp;\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|t'}} || {{lang|gv|eh}} || {{lang|gv|dy mie}}\n|-\n| is || he || well\n|-\n| colspan=3 | \"He is well\"\n|}\n&nbsp;\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|t'}} || {{lang|gv|eh}} || {{lang|gv|ayns}} || {{lang|gv|y}} || {{lang|gv|thie-oast}}\n|-\n| is || he || in || the || house-ale ([[pub]])\n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"He is in the ale-house ([[pub]]).\"\n|}\n</div>\n\nWhere the predicate is a noun, it must be converted to a prepositional phrase headed by the preposition {{lang|gv|in}} (\"in\") + possessive pronoun (agreeing with the subject) in order for the substantive verb to be grammatical:\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|t'}} || {{lang|gv|eh}} || {{lang|gv|ny}} || {{lang|gv|wooinney}} || {{lang|gv|mie}}\n|-\n| is || he || in-his || man || good\n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"He is a good man\" (lit. \"He is in his good man\")<ref>Broderick 1993, 277</ref>\n|}\n</div>\n\nOtherwise, the copula is used when the predicate is a noun. The copula itself takes the form {{lang|gv|is}} or {{lang|gv|she}} in the present tense, but it is often omitted in affirmative statements:\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|She}} || {{lang|gv|Manninagh}} || {{lang|gv|mish}}\n|-\n| {{sc|copula}} || Manxman || me\n|-\n| colspan=3 | \"I am a Manxman.\"<ref>Broderick 1993, 278</ref>\n|}\n&nbsp;\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|Shoh}} || {{lang|gv|'n}} || {{lang|gv|dooinney}}\n|-\n| this || the || man\n| colspan=3 | \"This is the man.\"<ref name=Thoms105>Thomson 1992, 105</ref>\n|}\n</div>\n\nIn questions and negative sentences, the present tense of the copula is {{lang|gv|nee}}:\n\n<div style=\"margin-left:2em\">\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|Cha}} || {{lang|gv|nee}} || {{lang|gv|mish}} || {{lang|gv|eh}}\n|-\n| not || {{sc|copula}} || me || him\n|-\n| colspan=4 | \"I am not him.\"<ref name=Thoms105 />\n|}\n&nbsp;\n{|\n| {{lang|gv|Nee}} || {{lang|gv|shoh}} || {{lang|gv|'n}} || {{lang|gv|lioar?}}\n|-\n| {{sc|copula}} || this || the || book\n|-\n| colspan=4 | \"Is this the book?\"<ref name=Thoms105 />\n|}\n</div>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nManx vocabulary is predominantly of Goidelic origin, derived from Old Irish and closely related to words in Irish and Scottish Gaelic. However, Manx itself, as well as the languages from which it is derived, borrowed words from other languages as well, especially [[Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[French language|French]] (particularly [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]), and English (both [[Middle English]] and Modern English).<ref>Broderick 1993, 282\u201383</ref>\n\nThe following table shows a selection of nouns from the [[Swadesh list]] and indicates their pronunciations and etymologies.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Manx\n!IPA<ref name=Brodvol2>Broderick 1984\u201386, vol. 2</ref>\n!English\n!Etymology<ref>Macbain 1911; ''Dictionary of the Irish Language''; Broderick 1984\u201386, vol. 2</ref>\n|-\n|{{lang|gv|aane}}\n|{{IPA|[e\u02d0n]}}\n|liver\n|Goidelic; from Mid.Ir. {{lang|mga|ae}} < O.Ir. {{lang|sga|\u00f3a}}; cf.

The name means \"mousy grey\" in Manx.]]\nForeign loanwords are primarily [[Norse language|Norse]] and [[English language|English]], with a smaller number coming from French. Some examples of Norse loanwords are ''garey'' (\"[[garden]]\", from ''[[wikt:gar\u00f0r|gar\u00f0r]]'', \"enclosure\") and ''sker'' meaning a sea rock (from ''[[wikt:sker|sker]]'', compare with ''[[wikt:skj\u00e6r#Etymology 2|skj\u00e6r]]'' and ''[[wikt:sker#Icelandic|sker]]''). Examples of French loanwords are ''danjeyr'' (\"danger\", from ''[[wikt:danger#French|danger]]'') and ''vondeish'' (\"advantage\", from ''[[wikt:avantage|avantage]]'').\n\nEnglish loanwords were common in late (pre-revival) Manx, e.g. ''boy'' (\"boy\"), ''badjer'' (\"[[badger]]\"), rather than the more usual Gaelic ''guilley'' and ''brock''. [[Henry Jenner]], on asking someone what he was doing, was told ''Ta mee smokal pipe'' (\"I am smoking a pipe\"), and that \"[he] certainly considered that he was talking Manx, and not English, in saying it.\" In more recent years, there has been a reaction against such borrowing, resulting in coinages for technical vocabulary. Despite this, [[calque]]s exist in Manx, not necessarily obvious to its speakers.\n\nSome religious terms come ultimately from Latin, Greek and Hebrew, e.g. ''casherick'' (holy), from the Latin ''consecr\u0101tus''; ''mooinjer'' (people) from the Latin ''monasterium'' (originally a [[monastery]]; ''agglish'' (church) from the Greek ''\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1'' (''ekklesia'', literally meaning assembly) and ''abb'' ([[abbot]]) from the Hebrew \"\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0\" (''abba'', meaning \"father\"). These did not necessarily come directly into Manx, but via Old Irish. In more recent times, ''ulpan'' has been borrowed from [[modern Hebrew]]. Many Irish and English loanwords also have a classical origin, e.g. ''\u00e7hellveeish'' (Irish ''teilef\u00eds'') and ''\u00e7hellvane'' meaning [[television]] and [[telephone]] respectively. Foreign language words (usually known via English) are used occasionally especially for ethnic food, e.g. chorizo, spaghetti.\n\nTo fill gaps in recorded Manx vocabulary, revivalists have referred to modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic for words and inspiration.\n\nGoing in the other direction, Manx Gaelic has influenced [[Manx English]] (Anglo-Manx). Common words and phrases in Anglo-Manx originating in the language include ''tholtan'' (the \"th\" is pronounced as a \"t\") meaning a ruined farmhouse, ''quaaltagh'' meaning a [[first-foot]], ''keeill'' meaning a church (especially an old one), ''[[cammag]]'', ''traa-dy-liooar'' meaning \"time enough\", and [[Tynwald]] (''tinvaal''), which is ultimately of Norse origin, but comes via Manx. It is suggested that the [[House of Keys]] takes its name from ''Kiare as Feed'' (four and twenty), which is the number of its sitting members.\n\n==Comparative vocabulary examples==\n\n<center>\n{| cellspacing=\"7\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! style=\"background:#ffdead;\"| Manx Gaelic\n! style=\"background:#ffdead;\"| Irish\n! style=\"background:#ffdead;\"| Scots Gaelic\n! style=\"background:#ffdead;\"| Welsh\n! style=\"background:#ffdead;\"| English\n|- \n| ''Moghrey mie''\n| {{lang|ga|Maidin mhaith}}\n| {{lang|gd|Madainn mhath}}\n| {{lang|cy|Bore da}}\n| good morning\n|- \n| ''Fastyr mie''\n| {{lang|ga|Tr\u00e1thn\u00f3na maith}}\n| {{lang|gd|Feasgar math}}\n| {{lang|cy|Prynhawn da}}<br />{{lang|cy|Noswaith dda}}\n| good afternoon/evening\n|- \n| ''Slane lhiat'', ''Slane lhiu''\n| {{lang|ga|Sl\u00e1n leat}}, {{lang|ga|Sl\u00e1n libh}}\n| {{lang|gd|Sl\u00e0n leat}}, {{lang|gd|Sl\u00e0n leibh}}\n| {{lang|cy|Hwyl fawr}}\n| goodbye\n|- \n| ''Gura mie ayd'',<br />''Gura mie eu''\n| {{lang|ga|Go raibh maith agat}},<br />{{lang|ga|Go raibh maith agaibh}}\n| {{lang|gd|Tapadh leat}},<br />{{lang|gd|Tapadh leibh}}\n| {{lang|cy|Diolch}}\n| thank you\n|- \n| ''baatey''\n| {{lang|ga|b\u00e1d}}\n| {{lang|gd|b\u00e0ta}}\n| {{lang|cy|cwch}}\n| boat\n|- \n| ''barroose''\n| {{lang|ga|bus}}\n| {{lang|gd|bus}}\n| {{lang|cy|bws}}\n| bus\n|-\n| ''blaa''\n| {{lang|ga|bl\u00e1th}}\n| {{lang|gd|bl\u00e0th}}\n| {{lang|cy|blodyn}}\n| flower\n|- \n| ''booa''\n| {{lang|ga|b\u00f3}}\n| {{lang|gd|b\u00f2}}\n| {{lang|cy|buwch/bo}}\n| cow\n|- \n| ''cabbyl''\n| {{lang|ga|capall}}\n| {{lang|gd|capall}}\n| {{lang|cy|ceffyl}}\n| horse\n|- \n| ''cashtal''\n| {{lang|ga|caisle\u00e1n, caiseal}}\n| {{lang|gd|caisteal}}\n| {{lang|cy|castell}}\n| castle\n|- \n| ''creg''\n| {{lang|ga|carraig}}\n| {{lang|gd|carraig, creag}}\n| {{lang|cy|carreg}}\n| stone\n|- \n| ''eeast''\n| {{lang|ga|iasc}}\n| {{lang|gd|iasg}}\n| {{lang|cy|pysgodyn}}\n| fish [sg.]\n|- \n| ''ellan''\n| {{lang|ga|oile\u00e1n}}\n| {{lang|gd|eilean}}\n| {{lang|cy|ynys}}\n| island, eyot\n|- \n| ''gleashtan''\n| {{lang|ga|gluaiste\u00e1n}}, {{lang|ga|carr}}\n| {{lang|gd|c\u00e0r}}\n| {{lang|cy|car}}\n| car\n|- \n| ''kayt''\n| {{lang|ga|cat}}\n| {{lang|gd|cat}}\n| {{lang|cy|cath}}\n| cat\n|- \n| ''moddey''\n| {{lang|ga|madra}}, {{lang|ga|madadh}}\n| {{lang|gd|madadh}}\n| {{lang|cy|ci}}\n| dog, hound\n|- \n| ''shap''\n| {{lang|ga|siopa}}\n| {{lang|gd|b\u00f9th}}\n| {{lang|cy|siop}}\n| shop\n|- \n| ''thie''\n| {{lang|ga|tigh}}, {{lang|ga|teach}}\n| {{lang|gd|taigh}}\n| {{lang|cy|t\u0177}}\n| house\n|- \n| ''eean''\n| {{lang|ga|\u00e9an}}\n| {{lang|gd|eun}}, {{lang|gd|ian}}\n| {{lang|cy|aderyn}}, {{lang|cy|edn}}\n| bird\n|-\n| ''jees'', ''daa''\n| {{lang|ga|d\u00e1, dh\u00e1, d\u00f3; (people) beirt, d\u00eds}}\n| {{lang|gd|d\u00e0, dh\u00e0; (people) dithis}}\n| {{lang|cy|dau}} (m.)/{{lang|cy|dwy}} (f.)\n| two\n|-\n| ''oik''\n| {{lang|ga|oifig}}\n| {{lang|gd|oifis}}\n| {{lang|cy|swyddfa}}\n| office\n|-\n| ''ushtey''\n| {{lang|ga|uisce}}\n| {{lang|gd|uisge}}\n| {{lang|cy|d\u0175r}}, {{lang|cy|dwfr}}\n| water\n|}\n</center>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n* [[Cornish language|Cornish]], another revived [[Celtic language]].\n* [[Gaelic revival|Irish language revival]]\n* [[List of Celtic-language media]]\n* [[List of revived languages]]\n* [[List of television channels in Celtic languages]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* <!--Broderick 1984\u201386-->{{Cite book|title=A Handbook of Late Spoken Manx |first=George |last=Broderick |publisher=Niemeyer |location=T\u00fcbingen |year=1984\u201386 |edition=3 volumes |isbn=3-484-42903-8 |id=(vol.&nbsp;1), (vol.&nbsp;2), (vol.&nbsp;3)}}\n* <!--Broderick 1993-->{{Cite book|first=George |last=Broderick |pages=228\u201385 |chapter=Manx |editor=M.
