However, the actual name of the new state was ''Great Britain''. The name ''Great Britain'' (then sometimes spelled ''Great Brittaine'') was first used by James VI/I in October 1604, who indicated that henceforth he and his successors would be viewed as Kings of Great Britain, not Kings of England and Scotland. However the name was not applied to the ''state'' as a unit; both England and Scotland continued to be governed independently. Its validity as a name of the Crown is also questioned, given that monarchs continued using separate ordinals (e.g., James VI/I, James VII/II) in England and Scotland. To avoid confusion historians generally avoid using the term ''King of Great Britain'' until 1707 and instead to match the ordinal usage call the monarchs kings or queens of England and Scotland. Separate ordinals were abandoned when the two states merged in accordance with the [[Acts of Union 1707]], with subsequent monarchs using ordinals apparently based on English not Scottish history (it might be argued that the monarchs have simply taken the higher ordinal, which to date has always been English). One example is Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]], who is referred to as being \"the Second\" even though there never was an Elizabeth I of Scotland or Great Britain. Thus the term ''Great Britain'' is generally used from 1707.</ref> Of this new [[State (polity)|state]] the historian [[Simon Schama]] said: {{quotation|What began as a hostile merger would end in a full partnership in the most powerful [[going concern]] in the world... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in [[History of Europe|European history]].|sign=Simon Schama|source=<ref>{{cite episode|title=Britannia Incorporated |series=A History of Britain|serieslink=Simon Schama's A History of Britain|credits=[[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network=[[BBC One]]|airdate=22 May 2001|number=10|minutes= 3}}</ref>}} The [[Act of Union 1800]] added the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] to create the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nThe first decades were marked by [[Jacobite risings]] which ended with defeat for the Stuart cause at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. In 1763, [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|victory in the Seven Years' War]] led to the growth of the [[First British Empire]]. With defeat by the United States, France and Spain in the [[War of American Independence]], Britain lost its 13 American colonies and rebuilt a [[Second British Empire]] based in Asia and Africa. As a result [[culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]], and its technological, political, constitutional, and linguistic influence, became worldwide. Politically the central event was the [[French Revolution]] and its Napoleonic aftermath from 1793 to 1815, which British elites saw as a profound threat, and worked energetically to form multiple coalitions that finally defeated Napoleon in 1815. The [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]], who came to power in 1783, remained in power (with a short interruption) until 1830. Forces of reform, often emanating from the Evangelical religious elements, opened decades of political reform that broadened the ballot, and opened the economy to free trade. The outstanding political leaders of the 19th century included Palmerston, Disraeli, Gladstone, and Salisbury. Culturally the [[Victorian era]] was a time of prosperity and dominant middle-class virtues when Britain dominated the world economy and maintained a generally peaceful century, 1815\u20131914. The [[First World War]] (1914\u20131918), with Britain in alliance with France, Russia and the United States, was a furious but ultimately successful total war with Germany. The resulting [[League of Nations]] was a favourite project in [[Interwar Britain]]. However, while the Empire remained strong, as did the [[London Stock Exchange|London financial markets]], the British industrial base began to slip behind Germany and, especially, the United States. Sentiments for peace were so strong that the nation supported appeasement of Hitler's Germany in the late 1930s, until the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 started the [[Second World War]]. In the Second World War France, the Soviet Union and the U.S. joined Britain as [[Allies of World War II|the main Allied powers]].\n\nBritain was no longer a military or economic superpower, as seen in the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956. Britain no longer had the wealth to maintain an empire, so it granted independence to almost all its possessions. The new states typically joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The postwar years saw great hardships, alleviated somewhat by large-scale financial aid from the United States, and some from Canada. Prosperity returned in the 1950s. Meanwhile, in 1945\u201350 the Labour Party built a welfare state, nationalized many industries, and created the [[National Health Service]]. The UK took a strong stand against Communist expansion after 1945, playing a major role in the [[Cold War]] and the formation of [[NATO]] as an anti-Soviet military alliance with West Germany, France, the U.S., Canada and smaller countries. [[NATO]] remains a powerful military coalition. The UK has been a leading member of the [[United Nations]] since its founding, as well as numerous other international organizations. In the 1990s neoliberalism led to the privatisation of nationalized industries and significant deregulation of business affairs. London's status as a world financial hub grew continuously. Since the 1990s large-scale [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution movements in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales]] have decentralized political decision-making. Britain has moved back and forth on its economic relationships with Western Europe. It joined the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973, thereby weakening economic ties with its Commonwealth. However, the [[Brexit]] referendum in 2016 committed the UK to leave the [[European Union]], which it did in 2020.\n\nIn 1922, Catholic Ireland seceded to become the [[Irish Free State]]; a day later, [[Northern Ireland]] seceded from the Free State and returned to the United Kingdom. In 1927 the United Kingdom changed its formal title to the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uk.html|title=The World Factbook \u2013 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}</ref> usually shortened to ''[[British Isles (terminology)|Britain]]'' and (after 1945) to the ''United Kingdom'' or ''UK''.\n\n==18th century==\n{{main|Early Modern Britain|Georgian era}}\n\n===Birth of the Union===\n{{main|Treaty of Union|Acts of Union 1707}}\n{{See also|Union of the Crowns|History of the formation of the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Articles of Union 1707.jpg|thumb|\"Articles of Union with Scotland\", 1707]]\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] came into being on 1 May 1707, as a result of the [[political union]] of the [[Kingdom of England]] (which included [[Wales]]) and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] under the [[Treaty of Union]]. This combined the two kingdoms into a single kingdom, and merged the two parliaments into a single [[parliament of Great Britain]]. [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] became the first monarch of the new Great Britain. Although now a single kingdom, certain institutions of Scotland and England remained separate, such as [[Scots Law|Scottish]] and [[English law]]; and the [[Presbyterian]] [[Church of Scotland]] and the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Church of England]]. England and Scotland each also continued to have their own system of education.\n\nMeanwhile, the long [[War of the Spanish Succession]] against France (1701\u20131714) was under way. It see-sawed back and forth until a more peace-minded government came to power in London and the treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastadt]] in 1713\u20131714 ended the war. British historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] argues: {{Quote|That Treaty [of Utrecht], which ushered in the stable and characteristic period of Eighteenth-Century civilization, marked the end of danger to Europe from the old French monarchy, and it marked a change of no less significance to the world at large,\u2014the maritime, commercial and financial supremacy of Great Britain.<ref>G.M.

The [[South Sea Bubble]] was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The South Sea Company was a joint-stock company in London. Its ostensible object was to grant trade monopolies in South America; but its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to \u00a331&nbsp;million through [[market manipulation]] and speculation. It raised money four times in 1720 by issuing stock, which was purchased by about 8,000 investors. The share price kept soaring every day, from \u00a3130 a share to \u00a31,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places\u2014even to the king. [[Robert Walpole]] managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.<ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) pp.&nbsp;334\u201338</ref><ref>Julian Hoppit, \"The Myths of the South Sea Bubble\", ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'', December 1962, Vol. 12 Issue 1, pp.&nbsp;141\u201365. {{doi|10.1017/S0080440102000051}}. {{JSTOR|3679343}}.</ref>\n\n===Robert Walpole===\nRobert Walpole is now generally regarded as the first Prime Minister, from, 1719\u201342, and indeed he invented the role.{{dubious|date=September 2018}} The term was applied to him by friends and foes alike by 1727. Historian Clayton Roberts summarizes his new functions: \n: He monopolized the counsels of the King, he closely superintended the administration, he ruthlessly controlled patronage, and he led the predominant party in Parliament.<ref>Quoted in Stephen Taylor, \"Walpole, Robert, first earl of Orford (1676\u20131745)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28601, accessed 15 Sept 2017]</ref>\nWalpole was a master of the effective use of patronage, as were his two disciples who succeeded him as prime minister, [[Henry Pelham]] (1743\u20131754) and Pelham's brother the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] (1754\u20131762).<ref>Reed Browning, ''Duke of Newcastle'' (1975) pp.&nbsp;254\u201360.</ref>\n\n===Moralism, benevolence and hypocrisy===\n[[File:Four Times of the Day - Morning - Hogarth.jpg|thumb|[[18th-century London]] by [[William Hogarth]]]]\nHypocrisy became a major topic in English political history in the early 18th century. The [[Toleration Act 1689]] allowed for certain rights for religious minorities, but Protestant [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]] (such as Congregationalists and Baptists) were still deprived of important rights, such as the right to hold office. Nonconformists who wanted to hold office ostentatiously took the Anglican sacrament once a year in order to avoid the restrictions. High Church Anglicans were outraged. They outlawed what they called \"occasional conformity\" in 1711 with the [[Occasional Conformity Act 1711]].<ref>Clyve Jones, \"'Too Wild to Succeed': The Occasional Conformity Bills and the Attempts by the House of Lords to Outlaw the Tack in the Reign of Anne.\" ''Parliamentary History'' 30.3 (2011): 414\u2013427.</ref> In the political controversies using sermons, speeches, and pamphlet wars, both high churchmen and Nonconformists attacked their opponents as insincere and hypocritical, as well as dangerously zealous, in contrast to their own moderation. This campaign of moderation versus zealotry peaked in 1709 during the impeachment trial of high church preacher [[Henry Sacheverell]]. Historian Mark Knights argues that by its very ferocity, the debate may have led to more temperate and less hypercharged political discourse. \"Occasional conformity\" was restored by the Whigs when they returned to power in 1719.<ref>Mark Knights, \"Occasional conformity and the representation of dissent: hypocrisy, sincerity, moderation and zeal.\" ''Parliamentary History'' 24#1 (2005): 41\u201357.</ref>\n\nEnglish author [[Bernard Mandeville]]'s famous \"[[Fable of the Bees]]\" (1714) explored the nature of hypocrisy in contemporary European society. On one hand, Mandeville was a \"moralist\" heir to the French Augustinianism of the previous century, viewing sociability as a mere mask for vanity and pride. On the other, he was a \"materialist\" who helped found modern economics. He tried to demonstrate the universality of human appetites for corporeal pleasures. He argued that the efforts of self-seeking entrepreneurs are the basis of emerging commercial and industrial society, a line of thought that influenced [[Adam Smith]] (1723\u20131790) and 19th-century [[Utilitarianism]]. A tension arose between these two approaches  concerning the relative power of norms and interests, the relationship between motives and behaviour, and the historical variability of human cultures.<ref>Daniel Luban, \"Bernard Mandeville as Moralist and Materialist.\" ''History of European Ideas'' 41.7 (2015): 831\u2013857.</ref>\n\nFrom around 1750 to 1850, Whig aristocrats in England boasted of their special benevolence for the common people. They claimed to be guiding and counselling reform initiatives to prevent the outbreaks of popular discontent that caused instability and revolution across Europe. However Tory and radical critics accused the Whigs of hypocrisy\u2014alleging they were deliberately using the slogans of reform and democracy to boost themselves into power while preserving their precious aristocratic exclusiveness. Historian L.G. Mitchell defends the Whigs, pointing out that thanks to them radicals always had friends at the centre of the political elite, and thus did not feel as marginalised as in most of Europe. He points out that the debates on the 1832 Reform Bill showed that reformers would indeed receive a hearing at parliamentary level with a good chance of success.<ref>L.G. Mitchell, \"The Whigs, the People, and Reform\", ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' (1999), Vol. 85, pp.&nbsp;25\u201341</ref> Meanwhile, a steady stream of observers from the Continent commented on the English political culture. Liberal and radical observers noted the servility of the English lower classes, the obsession everyone had with rank and title, the extravagance of the aristocracy, a supposed anti-intellectualism, and a pervasive hypocrisy that extended into such areas as social reform. There were not so many conservative visitors. They praised the stability of English society, its ancient constitution, and reverence for the past; they ignored the negative effects of industrialisation.<ref>Paul Langford, \"The English as Reformers: Foreign Visitors' Impressions, 1750\u20131850\" ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' (1999), Vol. 85, pp.&nbsp;101\u2013119.</ref>\n\nHistorians have explored crimes and vices of England's upper classes, especially duelling, suicide, adultery and gambling. They were tolerated by the same courts that executed thousands of poor men and boys for lesser offenses. No aristocrat was punished for killing someone in a duel.  However the emerging popular press specialized in sensationalistic stories about upper-class vice,  which led the middle classes to focus their critiques on a decadent aristocracy that had much more money, but much less morality. than the middle class.<ref>Donna T.

It maintained a relatively large and expensive [[Royal Navy]], along with a small standing army. When the need arose for soldiers it hired mercenaries or financed allies who fielded armies. The rising costs of warfare forced a shift in the sources of government financing, from the income from royal agricultural estates and special imposts and taxes to reliance on customs and excise taxes; and, after 1790, an income tax. Working with bankers in the City, the government raised large loans during wartime and paid them off in peacetime. The rise in taxes amounted to 20% of national income, but the private sector benefited from the increase in economic growth. The demand for war supplies stimulated the industrial sector, particularly naval supplies, munitions and textiles, which gave Britain an advantage in international trade during the postwar years.<ref>Robert M. Kozub, \"Evolution of Taxation in England, 1700\u20131850: A Period of War and Industrialization\", ''Journal of European Economic History'', Fall 2003, Vol. 32 Issue 2, pp.&nbsp;363\u201388</ref><ref>John Brewer, ''The Sinews of Power: War, Money and the English State, 1688\u20131783'' (1990)</ref><ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' (1989) pp.&nbsp;80\u201384</ref>\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] polarised British political opinion in the 1790s, with conservatives outraged at the killing of the king, the expulsion of the nobles, and the [[Reign of Terror]]. Britain was at war against France almost continuously from 1793 until the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815. Conservatives castigated every radical opinion in Britain as \"Jacobin\" (in reference to the [[Jacobin|leaders of the Terror]]), warning that radicalism threatened an upheaval of British society. The Anti-Jacobin sentiment, well expressed by [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Anti-Jacobin|many popular writers]] was strongest among the landed gentry and the upper classes.<ref>Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ed.

The signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] had important consequences for Britain and its empire. In North America, France's future as a colonial power there was effectively ended with the ceding of [[New France]] to Britain (leaving a sizeable French-speaking population under British control) and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] to Spain. Spain ceded [[Florida]] to Britain. In India, the [[Carnatic Wars#Third Carnatic War (1756\u20131763)|Carnatic War]] had left France still in control of its [[French India|enclaves]] but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, effectively leaving the future of India to Britain. [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|The British victory over France]] in the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's dominant colonial power.<ref>Maya Jasanoff, ''Edge of Empire: Lives, Culture, and Conquest in the East, 1750\u20131850'' (2006) p.&nbsp;21</ref>\n\nDuring the 1760s and 1770s, relations between the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of opposition to Parliament's repeated attempts to tax American colonists without their consent.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ferguson|last=Niall|title=Empire|publisher=Penguin|year=2004|pages=73}}</ref> Disagreement turned to violence and in 1775 the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. In 1776 the Patriots expelled royal officials and [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared the independence of the United States of America]]. After capturing a British invasion army in 1777, the US formed an alliance with France (and in turn Spain aided France), evening out the military balance. The British army controlled only a handful of coastal cities. 1780\u201381 was a low point for Britain. Taxes and deficits were high, government corruption was pervasive, and the war in America was entering its sixth year with no apparent end in sight. The [[Gordon Riots]] erupted in London during the spring of 1781, in response to increased concessions to Catholics by Parliament. In October 1781 [[Lord Cornwallis]] surrendered his army at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown, Virginia]]. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed in 1783, formally terminating the war and recognising the independence of the United States.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''Crisis of Empire: Britain and America in the Eighteenth Century'' (2010)</ref>\n\n[[File:Surrender of General Burgoyne.jpg|thumb|British general John Burgoyne shown surrendering at Saratoga (1777), ''[[Surrender of General Burgoyne]]'' painting by [[John Trumbull]] 1822]]\nThe loss of the Thirteen Colonies, at the time Britain's most populous colonies, marked the transition between the \"first\" and \"second\" empires,<ref>{{cite book|first=Pagden|last=Anthony|title=The Origins of Empire, The Oxford History of the British Empire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|pages=92}}</ref> in which Britain shifted its attention to Asia, the Pacific and later Africa. [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that [[free trade]] should replace the old [[mercantilist]] policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal. The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Lawrence|title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire|year=2001|publisher=Abacus|pages=119}}</ref> confirmed Smith's view that political control was not necessary for economic success.\n\nDuring its first 100 years of operation, the focus of the [[British East India Company]] had been trade, not the building of an empire in India. Company interests turned from trade to territory during the 18th century as the Mughal Empire declined in power and the British East India Company struggled with its French counterpart, the ''[[French East India Company|La Compagnie fran\u00e7aise des Indes orientales]]'', during the [[Carnatic Wars]] of the 1740s and 1750s. The British, led by [[Robert Clive]], defeated the French and their Indian allies in the [[Battle of Plassey]], leaving the Company in control of [[Bengal]] and a major military and political power in India. In the following decades it gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or indirectly via local puppet rulers under the threat of force of the [[Indian Army]], 80% of which was composed of native Indian [[sepoys]].\n\n[[File:Cookroutes.png|thumb|Voyages of the explorer James Cook]]\nOn 22 August 1770, [[James Cook]] discovered the eastern coast of Australia<ref>{{cite book|last=Knibbs|first=Sir George Handley|author2=Commonwealth Bureau of Census|title=Official year book of the Commonwealth of Australia|year=1908|publisher=Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics|page=52}}</ref> while on a scientific [[First voyage of James Cook|voyage]] to the South Pacific.

But the following January, [[Louis XVI]] was beheaded. This combined with a threatened invasion of the Netherlands by France spurred Britain to declare war. For the next 23 years, the two nations were at war except for a short period in 1802\u20131803. Britain alone among the nations of Europe never submitted to or formed an alliance with France. Throughout the 1790s, the British repeatedly defeated the navies of France and its allies, but were unable to perform any significant land operations. An Anglo-Russian invasion of the Netherlands in 1799 accomplished little except the capture of the Dutch fleet.\n\nAt the threshold to the 19th century, Britain was challenged again by France under [[Napoleon]], in a struggle that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations: the constitutional monarchy of Great Britain versus the liberal principles of the French Revolution ostensibly championed by the Napoleonic empire.<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Lawrence|title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire|year=2001|publisher=Abacus|pages=152}}</ref> It was not only Britain's position on the world stage that was threatened: Napoleon threatened invasion of Britain itself, and with it, a fate similar to the countries of continental Europe that his armies had overrun.\n\n==1800 to 1837==\n{{main|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland}}\n{{further|Georgian era|British Regency|Victorian era|British Empire|History of British society#Georgian society}}\n\n===Union with Ireland===\n{{image frame|width=220|border=no|content=[[File:Flags of the Union Jack.svg|220px]]|caption=The [[Flag of the United Kingdom]] is based on the flags of [[Flag of England|England]], [[Flag of Scotland|Scotland]] and the [[saltire]] of the [[Order of St Patrick]] (not the [[flag of Ireland]])}}\n{{main|Act of Union 1800|Irish issue in British politics}}\nOn 1 January 1801, the first day of the 19th century, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] joined to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nThe legislative union of Great Britain and Ireland was brought about by the Act of Union 1800, creating the \"[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]\". The Act was passed in both the Parliament of Great Britain and the [[Parliament of Ireland]], dominated by the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and lacking representation of the country's [[Roman Catholic]] population. Substantial majorities were achieved, and according to contemporary documents this was assisted by [[bribery]] in the form of the awarding of [[peerage]]s and [[British honours system|honours]] to opponents to gain their votes.<ref>Alan J. Ward, ''The Irish Constitutional Tradition'' p.&nbsp;28.</ref> Under the terms of the merger, the separate Parliaments of [[Parliament of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Parliament of Ireland|Ireland]] were abolished, and replaced by a united [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Ireland thus became an integral part of the United Kingdom, sending around 100 MPs to the House of Commons at Westminster and 28 [[representative peers]] to the House of Lords, elected from among their number by the Irish peers themselves, except that Roman Catholic peers were not permitted to take their seats in the Lords. Part of the trade-off for the Irish Catholics was to be the granting of [[Catholic Emancipation]], which had been fiercely resisted by the all-Anglican Irish Parliament. However, this was blocked by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], who argued that emancipating the Roman Catholics would breach his [[Coronation Oath]]. The Roman Catholic hierarchy had endorsed the Union. However the decision to block Catholic Emancipation fatally undermined the appeal of the Union.\n\n===Napoleonic wars===\n{{main|The United Kingdom in the Napoleonic Wars}}\nDuring the [[War of the Second Coalition]] (1799\u20131801), Britain occupied most of the French and Dutch colonies (the Netherlands had been a satellite of France since 1796), but tropical diseases claimed the lives of over 40,000 troops. When the Treaty of Amiens created a pause, Britain was forced to return most of the colonies. In May 1803, war was declared again. Napoleon's plans to invade Britain failed due to the inferiority of his navy, and in 1805, Lord Nelson's fleet decisively defeated the French and Spanish at Trafalgar, which was the last significant naval action of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n[[File:Trafalgar-Auguste Mayer.jpg|thumb|The British {{HMS|Sandwich|1759|6}} fires to the French [[flagship]] {{ship|French ship|Bucentaure|1803|6}} (completely dismasted) into battle off [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].

This policy aimed to weaken the British export economy closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Napoleon hoped that isolating Britain from the Continent would end its economic dominance. It never succeeded in its objective. Britain possessed the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade to its possessions from its rapidly expanding new Empire. Britain's naval supremacy meant that France could never enjoy the peace necessary to consolidate its control over Europe, and it could threaten neither the home islands nor the main British colonies.\n\nThe Spanish uprising in 1808 at last permitted Britain to gain a foothold on the Continent. The Duke of Wellington and his army of British and Portuguese gradually pushed the French out of Spain and in early 1814, as Napoleon was being driven back in the east by the Prussians, Austrians, and Russians, Wellington invaded southern France. After Napoleon's surrender and exile to the island of Elba, peace appeared to have returned, but when he escaped back into France in 1815, the British and their allies had to fight him again. The armies of Wellington and Von Blucher defeated Napoleon once and for all at Waterloo.<ref>Rory Muir, ''Britain and the Defeat of Napoleon, 1807\u20131815'' (Yale University Press, 1996).</ref>\n\n====Financing the war====\nA key element in British success was its ability to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France. With a population of 16 million Britain was barely half the size of France with 30&nbsp;million. In terms of soldiers the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.<ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\u2014economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1989), pp. 128\u20139</ref> Most important, the British national output remained strong and the well-organized business sector channeled products into what the military needed. The system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. The British budget in 1814 reached \u00a366&nbsp;million, including \u00a310&nbsp;million for the Navy, \u00a340&nbsp;million for the Army, \u00a310&nbsp;million for the Allies, and \u00a338&nbsp;million as interest on the national debt. The national debt soared to \u00a3679&nbsp;million, more than double the GDP. It was willingly supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and tax payers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax. The whole cost of the war came to \u00a3831&nbsp;million. By contrast the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon's forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.<ref>Elie Halevy, ''A History of the English People in 1815'' (1924) vol 2 pp.&nbsp;205\u20136, 215\u2013228</ref><ref>Roger Knight, ''Britain Against Napoleon: The Organisation of Victory, 1793\u20131815'' (2013)</ref><ref>J.

It forbade the import of British goods into European countries allied with or dependent upon France, and installed the [[Continental System]] in Europe. All connections were to be cut, even the mail. British merchants smuggled in many goods and the Continental System was not a powerful weapon of economic war.<ref>Paul W.

The \"second war of independence\" for the American, it was little noticed in Britain, where all attention was focused on the struggle with France. The British could devote few resources to the conflict until the fall of Napoleon in 1814. American [[frigate]]s also inflicted a series of embarrassing defeats on the British navy, which was short on manpower due to the conflict in Europe. A stepped-up war effort that year brought about some successes such as the burning of Washington, but many influential voices such as the Duke of Wellington argued that an outright victory over the US was impossible.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''The War of 1812 in the Age of Napoleon'' (2009) is one of the few major British studies</ref>\n\nPeace was agreed to at the end of 1814, but [[Andrew Jackson]], unaware of this, won a great victory over the British at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in January 1815 (news took several weeks to cross the Atlantic before the advent of steam ships). Ratification of the Treaty of Ghent ended the war in February 1815. The major result was the permanent defeat of the Indian allies the British had counted upon. The US-Canada border was demilitarised by both countries, and peaceful trade resumed, although worries of an American conquest of Canada persisted into the 1860s.\n\n==Postwar reaction: 1815\u20131822==\nThe postwar era was a time of economic depression, poor harvests, growing inflation, and high unemployment among returning soldiers.  As industrialisation progressed, Britain was more urban and less rural, and power shifted accordingly.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''The Age of Improvement 1783\u20131867'' (1959).</ref>  The dominant Tory leadership, based in the declining rural sector, was fearful, reactionary and repressive. Tories feared the possible emergence of radicals who might be conspiring to emulate the dreaded [[French Revolution]].  In reality the violent radical element was small and weak; there were a handful of small conspiracies involving men with few followers and careless security; they were quickly suppressed.<ref>Eric J. Evans, ''Britain Before the Reform Act: Politics and Society 1815\u20131832'' (1989) pp 1\u201327.</ref>  Techniques of repression included the suspension of Habeas Corpus in 1817 (allowing the government to arrest and hold suspects without cause or trial).  Sidmouth's Gagging Acts of 1817 heavily muzzled the opposition newspapers; the reformers switched to pamphlets and sold 50,000 a week.   In reaction to the [[Peterloo massacre]] of 1819, the Liverpool government passed the \"[[Six Acts]]\" in 1819. They prohibited drills and military exercises; facilitated warrants for the search for weapons; outlawed public meetings of more than 50 people, including meetings to organize petitions; put heavy penalties on blasphemous and seditious publications; imposing a fourpenny stamp act on many pamphlets to cut down the flow on news and criticism. Offenders could be harshly punished including exile in Australia. In practice the laws were designed to deter troublemakers and reassure conservatives; they were not often used.  By the end of the 1820s, along with a general economic recovery, many of these repressive laws were repealed and in 1828 new legislation guaranteed the civil rights of religious dissenters.<ref>Philip Ziegler, ''Addington'' (1965) p 350</ref>\n\nA weak ruler as regent (1811\u201320) and king (1820\u201330), [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] let his ministers take full charge of government affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father, George III. The principle now became established that the king accepts as prime minister the person who wins a majority in the House of Commons, whether the king personally favours him or not. His governments, with little help from the king, presided over victory in the Napoleonic Wars, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Kenneth | year = 2005 | title = George IV: a Sketch | url = | journal = History Today | volume = 55 | issue = 10| pages = 30\u201336 }}</ref> His brother [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] ruled (1830\u201337), but was little involved in politics. His reign saw several reforms: the [[poor law]] was updated, [[child labour]] restricted, [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|slavery abolished]] in nearly all the [[British Empire]], and, most important, the [[Reform Act 1832]] refashioned the British electoral system.<ref>[[Brock, Michael]] (2004) \"William IV (1765\u20131837)\", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', (2004) {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/29451}}</ref>\n\nThere were no major wars until the [[Crimean War]] of 1853\u201356.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''A military history of Britain: from 1775 to the present'' (2008) pp.&nbsp;74\u201377</ref> While Prussia, Austria, and Russia, as absolute monarchies, tried to suppress liberalism wherever it might occur, the British came to terms with new ideas.

[[Catholic emancipation]] was secured in the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]], which removed the most substantial restrictions on Roman Catholics in Britain.<ref name=\"L. Woodward, 1938 pp 325\u201330\">E. L. Woodward, ''The Age of Reform, 1815\u20131870'' (1938), pp.&nbsp;325\u201330</ref>\n\nThe Whigs became champions of Parliamentary reform. They made [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] prime minister 1830\u20131834, and the [[Reform Act 1832]] became their signature measure. It broadened the franchise slightly and ended the system of [[rotten and pocket boroughs]] (where elections were controlled by powerful families), and gave seats to new industrial centres.  The aristocracy continued to dominate the government, the Army and Royal Navy, and high society.<ref name=\"L. Woodward, 1938 pp 325\u201330\"/> After parliamentary investigations demonstrated the horrors of child labour, limited reforms were passed in 1833.\n\n[[Chartism]] emerged after the 1832 Reform Bill failed to give the vote to the working class. Activists denounced the 'betrayal' of the working class and the 'sacrificing' of their interests by the 'misconduct' of the government. In 1838, Chartists issued the People's Charter demanding manhood suffrage, equal sized election districts, voting by ballots, payment of MPs (so poor men could serve), annual Parliaments, and abolition of property requirements. Elites saw the movement as pathological, so the Chartists were unable to force serious constitutional debate. Historians see Chartism as both a continuation of the 18th-century fight against corruption and as a new stage in demands for democracy in an industrial society.<ref>Malcolm Chase, ''Chartism: A New History'' (2007)</ref>\n\nIn 1832, Parliament abolished slavery in the Empire with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. The government purchased the slaves for \u00a320,000,000 (the money went to rich plantation owners who mostly lived in England), and freed the slaves, especially those in the Caribbean sugar islands.<ref>E.

Her long reign until 1901 saw Britain reach the zenith of its economic and political power. Exciting new technologies such as steam ships, railroads, photography, and telegraphs appeared, making the world much faster-paced. Britain again remained mostly inactive in Continental politics, and it was not affected by the wave of revolutions in 1848. The Victorian era saw the fleshing out of the second [[British Empire]]. Scholars debate whether the Victorian period\u2014as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political concerns that have come to be associated with the Victorians\u2014actually begins with her coronation or the earlier passage of the [[Reform Act 1832]]. The era was preceded by the [[Regency era]] and succeeded by the [[Edwardian period]].\n\nHistorians like Bernard Porter have characterized the mid-Victorian era, (1850\u20131870) as Britain's 'Golden Years.'.<ref>Bernard Porter, ''Britannia's Burden: The Political Evolution of Modern Britain 1851\u20131890'' (1994) ch 3</ref> There was peace and prosperity, as the national income per person grew by half. Much of the prosperity was due to the increasing industrialization, especially in textiles and machinery, as well as to the worldwide network of trade and engineering that produce profits for British merchants and experts from across the globe. There was peace abroad (apart from the short Crimean war, 1854\u201356), and social peace at home.  Reforms in industrial conditions were set by Parliament.  For example, in 1842, the nation was scandalized by the use of children in coal mines. The [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842|Mines Act of 1842]] banned employment of girls and boys under ten years old from working underground in coal mines.<ref>Lionel Rose, ''The Erosion of Childhood: Childhood in Britain 1860\u20131918'' (1991) p 11.</ref>  Opposition to the new order melted away, says Porter. The Chartist movement, peaked as a democratic movement among the working class in 1848; its leaders moved to other pursuits, such as trade unions and cooperative societies. The working class ignored foreign agitators like Karl Marx in their midst, and joined in celebrating the new prosperity. Employers typically were paternalistic, and generally recognized the trade unions.<ref>F. M. L. Thompson, ''Rise of Respectable Society: A Social History of Victorian Britain, 1830\u20131900'' (1988) pp.&nbsp;211\u201314</ref> Companies provided their employees with welfare services ranging from housing, schools and churches, to libraries, baths, and gymnasia. Middle-class reformers did their best to assist the working classes aspire to middle-class norms of 'respectability.'\n\nThere was a spirit of libertarianism, says Porter, as people felt they were free. Taxes were very low, and government restrictions were minimal. There were still problem areas, such as occasional riots, especially those motivated by anti-Catholicism. Society was still ruled by the aristocracy and the gentry, which controlled high government offices, both houses of Parliament, the church, and the military. Becoming a rich businessman was not as prestigious as inheriting a title and owning a landed estate. Literature was doing well, but the fine arts languished as the Great Exhibition of 1851 showcased Britain's industrial prowess rather than its sculpture, painting or music. The educational system was mediocre; the capstone universities (outside Scotland) were likewise mediocre.<ref>Porter, ch 1\u20133; K Theodore Hoppen, ''The Mid-Victorian Generation: 1846\u20131886'' (1998), ch 1 to 3, 9\u201311</ref>\nHistorian [[Llewellyn Woodward]] has concluded:<ref>Llewellyn Woodward, ''The Age of Reform, 1815\u20131870'' (2nd ed. 1962) p.&nbsp;629</ref>\n: For leisure or work, for getting or spending, England was a better country in 1879 than in 1815. The scales were less weighted against the weak, against women and children, and against the poor. There was greater movement, and less of the fatalism of an earlier age. The public conscience was more instructed, and the content of liberty was being widened to include something more than freedom from political constraint.... Yet England in 1871 was by no means an earthly paradise. The housing and conditions of life of the working class in town & country were still a disgrace to an age of plenty.\n\n===Social and cultural history===\n{{main|Victorian era}}\n\n===Foreign policy===\n{{Main|International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)}}\n\n====Free trade imperialism====\nThe Great London Exhibition of 1851 clearly demonstrated Britain's dominance in engineering and industry; that lasted until the rise of the United States and Germany in the 1890s.

Prince Albert was effective in defusing a [[Trent Affair|war scare in late 1861]]. The British people, who depended heavily on American food imports, generally favoured the United States. What little cotton was available came from New York, as the blockade by the US Navy shut down 95% of Southern exports to Britain. In September 1862, Britain (along with France) contemplated stepping in and negotiating a peace settlement, which could only mean war with the United States. But in the same month, US president [[Abraham Lincoln]] announced the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] would be issued in January 1863 making abolition of slavery in the Confederacy a war goal. Since support of the Confederacy now meant support for slavery, there was no longer any possibility of European intervention. However, the British working class were quite overwhelmingly pro-Union. In the end, although Britain could survive without Southern cotton, the North's meat and grain was more important to feed the UK's urban population, especially as a series of bad harvests had affected British agriculture in the late 1850s to early 1860s.<ref>Amanda Foreman, ''A World on Fire: Britain's Crucial Role in the American Civil War'' (2012)</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the British sold arms to both sides, built [[blockade runner]]s for a lucrative trade with the Confederacy, and surreptitiously allowed warships to be built for the Confederacy. The warships caused a major diplomatic row that was resolved in the [[Alabama Claims]] in 1872, in the Americans' favour.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Frank J. Merli|author2=David M.

Britain handled foreign policy and defence. The second half of the 19th century saw a major expansion of Britain's colonial empire in Asia and Africa as well as the Pacific . In the \"[[Scramble for Africa]]\", the boast was having the Union Jack flying from \"Cairo to Cape Town.\" Britain defended its empire with the world's dominant navy, and a small professional army. It was the only power in Europe to have no conscription.<ref>P.J. Marshall, ed., ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire'' (1996). [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521432115 online]</ref>\n\nThe rise of the [[German Empire]] after 1871 posed a new challenge, for it (along with the United States) threatened to take Britain's place as the world's foremost industrial power. Germany acquired a number of colonies in Africa and the Pacific, but Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] succeeded in achieving general peace through his balance of power strategy. When [[William II, German Emperor|William II]] became emperor in 1888, he discarded Bismarck, began using bellicose language, and planned to build a navy to rival Britain's.<ref>A.J.P.

The British imperial vision called for control over the new countries and the Dutch-speaking \"Boers\" (or \"[[Afrikaners]]\") fought back in the [[Second Boer War|War in 1899\u20131902]]. British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] argues that the Boers insisted on keeping full control of both their two small republics, allowing no role whatever for nonwhites, and distinctly limited roles for British and other European settlers. These \"[[Uitlander]]s\" were the base of the economy, paid 80 percent of the taxes, and had no vote. The Transvaal was in no sense a democracy, argues Roberts, for no black, Britain, Catholic or Jew was allowed to vote or hold any office. Johannesburg was the business centre, with 50,000 primarily British residents, but was not permitted any local government.

The 410,000 Boers were massively outnumbered, but amazingly they waged a successful guerrilla war, which gave the British regulars a difficult fight. The Boers were landlocked and did not have access to outside help.  The weight of numbers, superior equipment, and often brutal tactics eventually brought about a British victory. To defeat the guerrillas, the British rounded up their women and children into concentration camps, where many died of disease. World outrage focused on the camps, led by a large faction of the Liberal Party in Britain. However, the United States gave its support. The Boer republics were merged into [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910; it had internal self-government but its foreign policy was controlled by London and was an integral part of the British Empire.<ref>Denis Judd and Keith Surridge, ''The Boer War: A History'' (2002)</ref>\n[[File:The Second Anglo - Boer War, South Africa 1899 - 1902 ZZZ7150D.jpg|thumb|A group of British prisoners, with [[Winston Churchill]] on the right]]\nThe unexpectedly great difficulty in defeating the Boers forced a reevaluation of British policy.

Gladstone denounced Disraeli's policies of territorial aggrandizement, military pomp, and imperial symbolism (such as making the Queen Empress of India), saying it did not fit a modern commercial and Christian nation.\n\nIn foreign policy he is best known for battling and besting Russia. Disraeli's second term was dominated by the [[Eastern Question]]\u2014the slow decay of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the desire of Russia, to gain at its expense. Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the [[Suez Canal Company]] (in Ottoman-controlled Egypt). In 1878, faced with Russian victories against the Ottomans, he worked at the [[Congress of Berlin]] to maintain peace in the Balkans and made terms favourable to Britain which weakened Russia, its longstanding enemy.<ref>Marvin Swartz, ''The Politics of British Foreign Policy in the Era of Disraeli & Gladstone'' (1985)</ref>\n\nDisraeli's old reputation as the \"Tory democrat\" and promoter of the welfare state has faded as historians argue that he had few proposals for social legislation in 1874\u201380, and that the 1867 Reform Act did not reflect a vision for the unenfranchised working man.<ref>Maurice Cowling, ''1867: Disraeli, Gladstone and revolution'' (1967).</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen J.

Gladstone's first ministry saw many reforms including Disestablishment of the Protestant [[Church of Ireland]] and the introduction of [[Ballot Act 1872|secret voting]]. His party was defeated in 1874, but made a comeback based on opposition to Turkey's [[Bulgarian atrocities]] against Christians. Gladstone's [[Midlothian Campaign]] of 1879\u201380 was an pathbreaking introduction of many modern political campaigning techniques. His Liberal party was increasingly pulled apart on the Irish issue. He proposed Irish [[home rule]] in 1886; It failed to pass and the resulting split in the Liberal Party kept it out of office for most of the next 20 years.\n\nGladstone's financial policies, based on the notion of balanced budgets, low taxes and [[laissez-faire]], were suited to a developing capitalist society but could not respond effectively as economic and social conditions changed. Called the \"Grand Old Man\" later in life, he was always a dynamic popular orator who appealed strongly to British workers and lower middle class. The deeply religious Gladstone brought a new moral tone to politics with his evangelical sensibility and opposition to aristocracy. His moralism often angered his upper-class opponents (including Queen Victoria, who strongly favoured Disraeli), and his heavy-handed control split the Liberal party. His foreign policy goal was to create a European order based on cooperation rather than conflict and mutual trust instead of rivalry and suspicion; the rule of law was to supplant the reign of force and self-interest. This Gladstonian concept of a harmonious [[Concert of Europe]] was opposed to and ultimately defeated by the Germans with a [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarckian]] system of manipulated alliances and antagonisms.<ref>H.C.G.

With the advent of the 20th century, things such as motion pictures, automobiles, and aeroplanes were coming into use. The new century was characterised by a feeling of great optimism. The social reforms of the last century continued into the 20th with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] being formed in 1900. Edward died in 1910, to be succeeded by [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], who reigned 1910\u201336. Scandal-free, hard working and popular, George V was the British monarch who, with Queen Mary, established the modern pattern of exemplary conduct for British royalty, based on middle-class values and virtues. He understood the overseas Empire better than any of his prime ministers and used his exceptional memory for figures and details, whether of uniforms, politics, or relations, to good effect in reaching out in conversation with his subjects.<ref>H.C.G. Matthew, \"George V (1865\u20131936)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', (2004); online edn, January 2008</ref>\n\nThe era was prosperous but political crises were escalating out of control. [[George Dangerfield]] (1935) identified the \"strange death of liberal England\" as the multiple crisis that hit simultaneously in 1910\u20131914 with serious social and political instability arising from the Irish crisis, [[Great Labour Unrest|labour unrest]], the women's suffrage movements, and partisan and constitutional struggles in Parliament. At one point it even seemed the Army might refuse orders dealing with Northern Ireland.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''[[The Strange Death of Liberal England: 1910\u20131914]]'' (1935)</ref> No solution appeared in sight when the unexpected outbreak of the Great War in 1914 put domestic issues on hold.\n\n[[Ross McKibbin]] argues that the political party system of the Edwardian era was in delicate balance on the eve of the war in 1914. The Liberals were in power with a progressive alliance of Labour and, off and on, Irish Nationalists. The coalition was committed to free trade (as opposed to the high tariffs the Conservatives sought), free collective bargaining for trades unions (which Conservatives opposed), an active social policy that was forging the welfare state, and constitutional reform to reduce the power of the House of Lords. The coalition lacked a long-term plan, because it was cobbled together from leftovers from the 1890s. The sociological basis was non-Anglican religion and non-English ethnicity rather than the emerging class conflict emphasized by Labour.<ref>[[Ross McKibbin]], ''Parties and People: England, 1914\u20131951'' (2010)</ref>\n\n===First World War===\n{{main|British entry into World War I|History of the United Kingdom during the First World War}}\nOn 4 August, the King declared war on Germany and Austria, following the advice of Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. The rest of the Empire automatically followed. The cabinet's basic reasons for declaring war focused on a deep commitment to France and avoidance of splitting the Liberal Party. Top Liberals led by Asquith and Foreign Secretary [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] threatened to resign if the cabinet refused to support France. That would deeply split the party and mean loss of control of the government to a coalition or to the Unionist (i.e. Conservative) opposition.  However, the large antiwar element among Liberals, with David Lloyd George as spokesperson, would support the war to honour the 1839 treaty that guaranteed Belgian neutrality.

The economy grew about 14% from 1914 to 1918 despite the absence of so many men in the services; by contrast the German economy shrank 27%. The War saw a decline of civilian consumption, with a major reallocation to munitions. The government share of GDP soared from 8% in 1913 to 38% in 1918 (compared to 50% in 1943). The war forced Britain to use up its financial reserves and borrow large sums from New York banks. After the U.S. entered in April 1917, the Treasury borrowed directly from the U.S. government.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Stevenson|title=With Our Backs to the Wall: Victory and Defeat in 1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06KYLGALKNEC&pg=PA370|year=2011|publisher=Harvard U.P.|page=370|isbn=9780674062269}}</ref><ref>Niall Ferguson, ''The Pity of War'' (1998) p.&nbsp;249</ref>\n\nThe Royal Navy dominated the seas, defeating the smaller German fleet in the only major naval battle of the war, the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916. Germany was blockaded, leading to an increasing shortage short of food. Germany's naval strategy increasingly turned towards use of [[U-boat]]s to strike back against the British, despite the risk of triggering war with the powerful neutral power, the United States.  Berlin declared the water routes to Britain were war zones where any ship, neutral or otherwise, was a target. nevertheless, international route law required giving the crew and passengers an opportunity to get into their lifeboats.  the U-boat without warning torpedoed the British passenger liner [[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]] in May 1915; it sank in 18 minutes, drowning over 1000 helpless civilians including over 100 Americans. Vigorous protests by American President Woodrow Wilson forced Berlin to abandon unrestricted submarine warfare. With victory over Russia in 1917, the German high command now calculated it could finally have numerical superiority on the Western Front. Planning for a massive spring offensive in 1918, it resumed the sinking of all merchant ships without warning, even if they were flying the American flag. The US entered the war alongside the Allies (without officially joining them), and provided the needed money and supplies to sustain the Allies' war efforts. The U-boat threat was ultimately defeated by a convoy system across the Atlantic.<ref>Paul Halpern, ''A naval history of World War I'' (2012).</ref>\n\nOn other fronts, the British, French, Australians, and Japanese seized Germany's colonies. Britain fought the Ottoman Empire, suffering defeats in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] and in [[Mesopotamia]] (Iraq), while arousing the Arabs who helped expel the Turks from their lands. Exhaustion and [[war-weariness]] were growing worse in 1917, as the fighting in France continued with no end in sight. After defeating Russia, the Germans tried to win in the spring of 1918 before the millions of American soldiers arrived. They failed, and they were overwhelmed by August and finally accepted an Armistice on 11 November 1918, that amounted to a surrender.<ref>Stevenson, ''With our backs to the wall'' (2011), pp.&nbsp;249\u201352, 534\u201344.</ref>\n \nBritish society and government were radically transformed by the repeated calls for manpower, the employment of women, the dramatic increase in industrial production and munitions, price controls and rationing, and the wide and deep emotional patriotism dedicated to winning the war.  Parliament took a backseat, as new departments bureaus committees and operations were created every week, experts were consulted, and the prime minister's [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] replaced the slow legislative process. Even after peace arrived, the new size and dynamism had permanently transformed the effectiveness of British government.<ref>Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the wars: 1918\u20131940'' (1955) pp.&nbsp;13\u201314.</ref>   David Lloyd George, also a Liberal, was the high-powered Minister of Munitions who replaced Asquith in late 1916. He gave energy and dynamism to the war effort with his remarkable ability to convince people to do what he wanted and thus get ideas put into actual useful high-speed motion. His top aide Winston Churchill said of Lloyd George: \"He was the greatest master of the art of getting things done and of putting things through that I ever knew; in fact no British politician my day has possessed half his competence as a mover of men and affairs.\"<ref>Mowat, ''Britain between the wars: 1918\u20131940'' (1955) p.&nbsp;10.</ref>\n\nVictorian attitudes and ideals that had continued into the first years of the 20th century changed during the First World War.

The lost generation felt its sacrifice was little regarded in Britain, with poems like [[Siegfried Sassoon]]'s ''Blighters'' criticising the ill-informed [[jingoism]] of the home front. The lost generation was politically inert, and never had its chance to make a generational change in political power.

The [[League of Nations]] was founded with the idea that nations could resolve their differences peacefully, but these hopes were unfulfilled. The harsh peace settlement imposed on Germany would leave it embittered and seeking revenge.\n\nAt the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, Lloyd George, American President Woodrow Wilson and French premier Georges Clemenceau made all the major decisions. They formed the [[League of Nations]] as a mechanism to prevent future wars. They sliced up the losers to form new nations in Europe, and divided up the German colonies and Ottoman holdings outside Turkey. They imposed what appeared to be heavy financial reparations (but in the event were of modest size). They humiliated Germany by forcing it to declare its guilt for starting the war, a policy that caused deep resentment in Germany and helped fuel reactions such as Nazism. Britain gained the German colony of [[Tanganyika]] and part of [[Togoland]] in Africa, while its dominions added other colonies. Britain gained League of Nations mandates over Palestine, which had been partly promised as a homeland for Jewish settlers, and Iraq. Iraq became fully independent in 1932. Egypt, which had been a British protectorate since 1882, became independent in 1922, although the British remained there until 1952.<ref>Alan Sharp, ''The Versailles Settlement: Peacemaking after the First World War, 1919\u20131923'' (2nd ed. 2008)</ref>\n\n===Irish independence and partition===\n{{main|Irish Home Rule bills|Partition of Ireland|Irish Declaration of Independence|Irish War of Independence}}\nIn 1912 the House of Commons passed a new Home Rule bill. Under the [[Parliament Act 1911]] the House of Lords retained the power to delay legislation by up to two years, so it was eventually enacted as the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]], but suspended for the duration of the war. Civil war threatened when the Protestant-Unionists of Northern Ireland refused to be placed under Catholic-Nationalist control. Semi-military units were formed ready to fight\u2014the [[Irish Unionism|Unionist]] [[Ulster Volunteers]] opposed to the Act and their Nationalist counterparts, the [[Irish Volunteers]] supporting the Act. The outbreak of the World War in 1914 put the crisis on political hold. A disorganized [[Easter Rising]] in 1916 was brutally suppressed by the British, which had the effect of galvanizing Nationalist demands for independence. Prime Minister Lloyd George failed to introduce Home Rule in 1918 and in the December 1918 General Election [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] won a majority of Irish seats. Its MPs refused to take their seats at Westminster, instead choosing to sit in the [[First D\u00e1il]] parliament in Dublin. A declaration of independence was ratified by [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the self-declared Republic's parliament in January 1919. An [[Anglo-Irish War]] was fought between Crown forces and the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] between January 1919 and June 1921. The war ended with the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of December 1921 that established the [[Irish Free State]].<ref>Joost Augusteign, ed., ''The Irish revolution, 1913\u20131923'' (Basingstoke, 2002)</ref> Six northern, predominantly Protestant counties became [[History of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] and have remained part of the United Kingdom ever since, despite demands of the Catholic minority to unite with the Republic of Ireland.<ref>Thomas Henessy, ''A History of Northern Ireland, 1920\u20131996'' (1998)</ref> Britain officially adopted the name \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" by the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]].\n\n==Interwar era 1918\u20131939==\n<!--linked from [[Template:United Kingdom topics]]-->\n{{Main|Interwar Britain}}\nHistorian [[Arthur Marwick]] sees a radical transformation of British society resulting from the Great War, a deluge that swept away many old attitudes and brought in a more equalitarian society. He sees the famous literary pessimism of the 1920s as misplaced, arguing there were major positive long-term consequences of the war to British society. He points to an energized self-consciousness among workers that quickly built up the Labour Party, the coming of partial woman suffrage, and an acceleration of social reform and state control of the economy. He sees a decline of deference toward the aristocracy and established authority in general, and the weakening among youth of traditional restraints on individual moral behavior. The chaperone faded away; village druggists sold contraceptives. Marwick says that class distinctions softened, national cohesion increased, and British society became more equal.<ref>Arthur Marwick, ''The Deluge: British Society and the First World War'' (1965)</ref>\n\n===Popular culture===\nAs a leisure, literacy, wealth, ease of travel, and a broadened sense of community grew in Britain from the late 19th century onward, there was more time and interest in leisure activities of all sorts, on the part of all classes.<ref name=\"Peter J.

Participation in sports and all sorts of leisure activities increased for the average Englishman, and his interest in spectator sports increased dramatically. By the 1920s the cinema and radio attracted all classes, ages and genders in very large numbers, with young women taking the lead.<ref>John K. Walton, ''Leisure in Britain, 1780\u20131939'' (1983).</ref> Working-class men wearing flat caps and eating fish and chips were boisterous football spectators. They sang along at the music hall, fancied their pigeons, gambled on horse racing, and took the family to Blackpool in summer. The cartoon realization of this life style ''[[Andy Capp]]'' began in 1957. Political activists complained that working-class leisure diverted men away from revolutionary agitation.<ref>Beck, \"Leisure and Sport in Britain.\" p.&nbsp;457</ref>\n\n====Cinema and radio====\n[[file:Hitchcock, Alfred 02.jpg|thumb|Film director Alfred Hitchcock, 1955]]\nThe British film industry emerged in the 1890s when cinemas in general broke through in the western world, and built heavily on the strong reputation of the London legitimate theatre for actors, directors and producers.<ref>Jeffrey Richards, ''Age of the Dream Palace: Cinema & Society in Britain 1930\u20131939'' (1990).</ref> The problem was that the American market was so much larger and richer. It bought up the top talent, especially when Hollywood came to the fore in the 1920s and produced over 80 percent of the total world output. Efforts to fight back were futile\u2014the government set a quota for British made films, but it failed. Hollywood furthermore dominated the lucrative Canadian and Australian markets.

[[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]] (1889\u20131971), an intensely moralistic engineer, was in full charge. His goal was to broadcast, \"All that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement....

They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play.<ref name=\"Peter J. Beck 2008\"/> Football proved highly attractive to the urban working classes, which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world.  New games became popular almost overnight, including golf, lawn tennis, cycling and hockey. Women were much more likely to enter these sports than the old established ones. The aristocracy and landed gentry, with their ironclad control over land rights, dominated hunting, shooting, fishing and horse racing.<ref>Derek Birley, ''Land of sport and glory: Sport and British society, 1887\u20131910'' (1995)</ref><ref>Derek Birley, ''Playing the Game: Sport and British Society, 1914\u20131945'' (1995)</ref>  Cricket reflected the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire (except Canada).

New additions to adult fiction doubled during the 1920s, reaching 2800 new books a year by 1935.

The first titles included novels by Ernest Hemingway and Agatha Christie. They were sold cheap (usually sixpence) in a wide variety of inexpensive stores such as Woolworth's.  Penguin aimed at an educated middle class \"middlebrow\" audience. It avoided the downmarket image of American paperbacks.

The [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919]] set up a system of government housing that followed the 1918 campaign promises of \"homes fit for heroes.\" This \"Addison Act\", named after the first Minister of Health, [[Christopher Addison]], required local authorities to survey their housing needs and start building houses to replace slums. The Treasury subsidized the low rents. In England and Wales 214,000 houses were built, and the Ministry of Health became largely a ministry of housing.<ref>Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars: 1918\u20131940'' (1955) pp.&nbsp;43\u201346</ref>\n\nThe [[Unemployment Insurance Act 1920]] passed at a time of very little unemployment. It set up the dole system that provided 39 weeks of unemployment benefits to practically the entire civilian working population except domestic service, farm workers, and civil servants. Funded in part by weekly contributions from both employers and employed, it provided weekly payments of 15s for unemployed men and 12s for unemployed women. Historian [[Charles Mowat]] calls these two laws \"Socialism by the back door\", and notes how surprised politicians were when the costs to the Treasury soared during the high unemployment of 1921.<ref>C.

[[Stanley Baldwin]], as leader of the Conservative Party (1923\u201337) and as Prime Minister (in 1923\u201324, 1924\u201329 and 1935\u201337), dominated British politics.<ref>Stuart Ball, \"Baldwin, Stanley, first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1867\u20131947)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' 2004; [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30550, online edn, January 2011] {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/30550}}</ref> His mixture of strong social reforms and steady government proved a powerful election combination, with the result that the Conservatives governed Britain either by themselves or as the leading component of the [[UK National Government|National Government]]. He was the last party leader to win over 50% of the vote (in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1931]]). Baldwin's political strategy was to polarize the electorate so that voters would choose between the Conservatives on the right and the Labour Party on the left, squeezing out the Liberals in the middle.<ref>Andrew J.

Baldwin's reputation soared in the 1920s and 1930s, but crashed after 1945 as he was blamed for the appeasement policies toward Germany, and as admirers of Churchill made him the Conservative icon. Since the 1970s Baldwin's reputation has recovered somewhat.<ref>Philip Williamson, \"Baldwin's Reputation: Politics and History, 1937\u20131967\", ''Historical Journal'' (March 2004) 47#1 pp.&nbsp;127\u201368 {{JSTOR|4091548}}</ref>\n\nLabour won the 1923 election, but in 1924 Baldwin and the Conservatives returned with a large majority.\n\nMcKibbin finds that the political culture of the interwar period was built around an anti-socialist middle class, supported by the Conservative leaders, especially Baldwin.<ref>Ross McKibbin, ''Parties and people: England, 1914\u20131951'' (Oxford, 2010)</ref>\n\n===Economics===\nTaxes rose sharply during the war and never returned to their old levels. A rich man paid 8% of his income in taxes before the war, and about a third afterwards. Much of the money went for the dole, the weekly unemployment benefits. About 5% of the national income every year was transferred from the rich to the poor. [[A. J. P.

There also remained a strong economic divide between the north and south of England during this period, with the south of England and the Midlands fairly prosperous by the Thirties, while parts of south Wales and the industrial north of England became known as \"distressed areas\" due to particularly high rates of unemployment and poverty. Despite this, the standard of living continued to improve as local councils built [[Council house|new houses]] to let to families rehoused from outdated [[slum]]s, with up to date facilities including indoor toilets, bathrooms and electric lighting now being included in the new properties.

Demand fell as oil began replacing coal for fuel. The [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 general strike]] was a nine-day nationwide walkout of 1.3&nbsp;million railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, iron workers and steelworkers supporting the 1.2&nbsp;million coal miners who had been locked out by the owners. The miners had rejected the owners' demands for longer hours and reduced pay in the face of falling prices.<ref>Medlicott, ''Contemporary England'', pp.&nbsp;223\u201330</ref> The Conservative government had provided a nine-month subsidy in 1925 but that was not enough to turn around a sick industry. To support the miners the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC), an umbrella organization of all trades unions, called out certain critical unions. The hope was the government would intervene to reorganize and rationalize the industry, and raise the subsidy. The Conservative government had stockpiled supplies and essential services continued with middle class volunteers. All three major parties opposed the strike. The Labour Party leaders did not approve and feared it would tar the party with the image of radicalism, for the [[Comintern]] in Moscow had sent instructions for Communists to aggressively promote the strike. The general strike itself was largely non-violent, but the miners' lockout continued and there was violence in Scotland. It was the only general strike in British history, for TUC leaders such as [[Ernest Bevin]] considered it a mistake . Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but Martin Pugh says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains.<ref>Alastair Reid, and Steven Tolliday, \"Review: The General Strike, 1926\", ''The Historical Journal'' (1977) 20#4 pp.&nbsp;1001\u201312 {{JSTOR|2638422}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pugh | first1 = Martin | authorlink = Martin Pugh (author) |year = 2006 | title = The General Strike | url = | journal = [[History Today]] | volume = 56 | issue = 5| pages = 40\u201347 }}</ref> The [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927]] made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union members to the Labour Party.

The challenge came from dictators, first [[Benito Mussolini]] of Italy, then [[Adolf Hitler]] of a much more powerful [[Nazi Germany]]. The [[League of Nations]] proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators. British policy was to \"appease\" them in the hopes they would be satiated. By 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military. The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed Czechoslovakia to Hitler's demands at the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>[[David Faber (politician)|David Faber]], ''Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II'' (2010)</ref> Instead of satiation Hitler menaced Poland, and at last Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] dropped appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland.

Conditions for housing worsened of course with the bombing, and clothing was in short supply.\n\nEquality increased dramatically, as incomes declined sharply for the wealthy and for white collar workers, as their taxes soared, while blue collar workers benefited from rationing and price controls.<ref>Sidney Pollard, ''The development of the British economy 1914\u20131950'' (1962 and later editions) pp.&nbsp;339\u201348</ref>\n\nPeople demanded an expansion of the welfare state as a reward to the people for their wartime sacrifices<ref>F.

It recommended that the various income maintenance services that a grown-up piecemeal since 1911 be systematized and made universal. Unemployment benefits and sickness benefits were to be universal. There would be new benefits for maternity. The old-age pension system would be revised and expanded, and require that a person retired.

To their surprise{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}, there were no plans. The leaders decided to act fast to keep up the momentum of the 1945 electoral landslide. They started with the [[Bank of England]], civil aviation, coal, and [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable & Wireless]]. Then came railways, canals, road haulage and trucking, electricity, and gas. Finally came iron and steel, which was a special case because it was a manufacturing industry. Altogether, about one fifth of the economy was nationalised. Labour dropped its plans to nationalise farmlands. The procedure used was developed by [[Herbert Morrison]], who as [[Lord President of the Council]] chaired the Committee on the Socialization of Industries.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} He followed the model that had already been used to establish public corporations such as the [[BBC]] (1927). In exchange for the shares, the owners of the companies were given government bonds paying low rates of interest, and the government took full ownership of each affected company, consolidating it into a national monopoly. The management remained the same, but they were now effectively civil servants working for the government.<ref name=\"auto\">Alan Sked and Chris Cook, ''Post-War Britain: A Political History'' (1979) pp.&nbsp;31\u201334</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">Samuel H. Beer, ''British Politics in the Collectivist Age'' (1965) pp.&nbsp;188\u2013216</ref>\n \nFor the Labour Party leadership, nationalisation was a way to consolidate economic planning in their own hands. It was not designed to modernise old industries, make them efficient, or transform their organisational structure. There was no money for modernisation, although the [[Marshall Plan]], operated separately by American planners, did force many British businesses to adopt modern managerial techniques. Hardline socialists were disappointed, as the nationalised industries seemed identical to the old private corporations, and national planning was made virtually impossible by the government's financial constraints. Socialism was in place, but it did not seem to make a major difference. Rank-and-file workers had long been motivated to support Labour by tales of the mistreatment of workers by foremen and the management. The foremen and the managers were the same people as before, with much the same power over the workplace. There was no worker control of industry. The unions resisted government efforts to set wages. By the time of the general elections in 1950 and 1951, Labour seldom boasted about nationalisation of industry. Instead it was the Conservatives who decried the inefficiency and mismanagement, and promised to reverse the takeover of steel and trucking.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Prosperity of the postwar years===\nAs the country headed into the 1950s, rebuilding continued and a number of immigrants from the remaining [[British Empire]], mostly the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent, were invited to help the rebuilding effort. As the 1950s wore on, Britain lost its place as a [[superpower]] and could no longer maintain its large [[British Empire|Empire]]. This led to decolonisation, and a withdrawal from almost all of its colonies by 1970. Events such as the [[Suez Crisis]] showed that the UK's status had fallen in the world. The 1950s and 1960s were, however, relatively prosperous times after the Second World War, and saw the beginning of a modernisation of the UK, with the construction of its first [[motorways]] for example, and also during the 1960s a great cultural movement began which expanded across the world.

[[Nationalism]] strengthened in other parts of the empire, particularly in India and in [[Egypt]].\n\nBetween 1867 and 1910, the UK had granted Australia, Canada, and New Zealand \"Dominion\" status (near complete autonomy within the Empire). They became charter members of the British Commonwealth of Nations (known as the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] since 1949), an informal but close-knit association that succeeded the British Empire. Beginning with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the remainder of the British Empire was almost completely dismantled. Today, most of Britain's former colonies belong to the Commonwealth, almost all of them as independent members. There are, however, 13 former British colonies, including [[Bermuda]], [[Gibraltar]], the [[Falkland Islands]], and others, which have elected to continue rule by London and are known as [[British overseas territory|British Overseas Territories]].\n\n===From the Troubles to the Belfast Agreement===\n{{main|The Troubles}}\n[[File:Larne RIR mural.jpg|thumb|A mural in Ulster supporting for the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]]]]\nIn the 1960s, moderate unionist Prime Minister of Northern Ireland [[Terence O'Neill]] tried to reform the system and give a greater voice to Catholics who comprised 40% of the population of Northern Ireland. His goals were blocked by militant Protestants led by the Rev. [[Ian Paisley]].<ref>Marc Mulholland, ''Northern Ireland at the Crossroads: Ulster Unionism in the O'Neill Years, 1960\u20139'' (2000)</ref> The increasing pressures from nationalists for reform and from unionists to resist reform led to the appearance of the civil rights movement under figures like [[John Hume]], [[Austin Currie]] and others. Clashes escalated out of control as the army could barely contain the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and the [[Ulster Defence Association]]. British leaders feared their withdrawal would give a \"Doomsday Scenario\", with widespread communal strife, followed by the mass exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees. London shut down Northern Ireland's parliament and began direct rule. By the 1990s, the failure of the IRA campaign to win mass public support or achieve its aim of a British withdrawal led to negotiations that in 1998 produced the '[[Good Friday Agreement]]'. It won popular support and largely ended the Troubles.<ref>Paul Dixon, ''Northern Ireland: The Politics of War and Peace'' (2008)</ref><ref>Christopher Farrington, ''Ulster Unionism and the Peace Process in Northern Ireland'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2006)</ref>\n\n===The economy in the late 20th century===\n{{main|History of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)}}\nAfter the relative prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s, the UK experienced extreme industrial strife and [[stagflation]] through the 1970s following a global economic downturn; Labour had returned to government in [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]] under [[Harold Wilson]] to end 13 years of Conservative rule. The Conservatives were [[1970 United Kingdom general election|restored to government]] in 1970 under [[Edward Heath]], who failed to halt the country's economic decline and was ousted in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|1974]] as Labour returned to power under Harold Wilson. The economic crisis deepened following Wilson's return and things fared little better under his successor [[James Callaghan]].\n\nA strict modernisation of its economy began under the controversial Conservative leader [[Margaret Thatcher]] following her [[1979 United Kingdom general election|election as prime minister]] in 1979, which saw a time of record [[unemployment]] as [[deindustrialisation]] saw the end of much of the country's [[manufacturing]] industries but also [[post-World War II boom|a time of economic boom]] as stock markets became liberalised and State-owned industries became [[privatization|privatised]].

The exploitation of [[North Sea]] [[gas]] and oil brought in substantial tax and export revenues to aid the new economic boom. This was also the time that the IRA took the issue of [[Northern Ireland]] to Great Britain, maintaining a prolonged bombing campaign on the British mainland.\n\nAfter the economic boom of the 1980s a brief but severe recession occurred between 1990 and 1992 following the economic chaos of [[Black Wednesday]] under government of [[John Major]], who had succeeded Margaret Thatcher in 1990. However the rest of the 1990s saw the beginning of a period of continuous economic growth that lasted over 16 years and was greatly expanded under the [[New Labour]] government of [[Tony Blair]] following his landslide election victory in 1997, with a rejuvenated party having abandoned its commitment to policies including nuclear disarmament and nationalisation of key industries, and no reversal of the Thatcher-led union reforms.\n\nFrom 1964 up until 1996, income per head had doubled, while ownership of various household goods had significantly increased. By 1996, two-thirds of households owned cars, 82% had central heating, most people owned a VCR, and one in five houses had a home computer.<ref>What Needs To Change: New Visions For Britain, edited by Giles Radice</ref> In 1971, 9% of households had no access to a shower or bathroom, compared with only 1% in 1990; largely due to demolition or modernisation of older properties which lacked such facilities. In 1971, only 35% had central heating, while 78% enjoyed this amenity in 1990. By 1990, 93% of households had colour television, 87% had telephones, 86% had washing machines, 80% had deep-freezers, 60% had video-recorders, and 47% had microwave ovens. Holiday entitlements had also become more generous. In 1990, nine out of ten full-time manual workers were entitled to more than four weeks of paid holiday a year, while twenty years previously only two-thirds had been allowed three weeks or more.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe postwar period also witnessed significant improvements in housing conditions. In 1960, 14% of British households had no inside toilet, while in 1967 22% of all homes had no basic hot water supply. By the 1990s, most homes had these amenities together with central heating, which was a luxury just two decades before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/article-1244777/Homes-affordable-50-years-ago--indoor-toilets.html#axzz2KQkRKKnY|title=Homes less affordable than 50 years ago \u2013 but at least more of them have indoor toilets!|work=thisismoney.co.uk}}</ref> From 1996/7 to 2006/7, real median household income increased by 20% while real mean household incomes increased by 23%.

It was vetoed in 1963 by [[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]].<ref>John Newhouse, ''De Gaulle and the Anglo-Saxons'' (1970), p. 226.</ref> After initially hesitating over the issue, [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour Government lodged the UK's second application (in May 1967) to join the Community.

In opposition the Labour Party was deeply divided, though its Leader, Harold Wilson, remained in favour. In the 1974 General Election the Labour Party manifesto included a pledge to renegotiate terms for Britain's membership and then hold a referendum on whether to stay in the EC on the new terms. This was a constitutional procedure without precedent in British history. In the subsequent referendum campaign, rather than the normal British tradition of \"collective responsibility\", under which the government takes a policy position which all cabinet members are required to support publicly, members of the Government (and the Conservative opposition) were free to present their views on either side of the question. A [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|referendum]] was duly held on 5 June 1975, and the proposition to continue membership was passed with a substantial majority.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/6/newsid_2499000/2499297.stm. 1975: UK embraces Europe in referendum] BBC On This Day</ref>\n\nThe [[Single European Act]] (SEA) was the first major revision of the 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]].

The Treaty of Lisbon will also make the Union's human rights charter, the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]], legally binding. The Lisbon Treaty also leads to an increase in the voting weight of the UK in the [[Treaty of Lisbon#Council of Ministers|Council of the European Union]] from 8.4% to 12.4%.

The three UK-wide political parties\u2014Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats\u2014campaigned together as part of the [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] campaign while the pro-independence Scottish National Party was the main force in the [[Yes Scotland]] campaign, together with the [[Scottish Green Party]] and the [[Scottish Socialist Party]]. Days before the vote, with the opinion polls closing, the three Better Together party leaders issued [[The Vow (devolution promise)|'The Vow']], a promise of more powers for Scotland in the event of a No vote. The referendum resulted in Scotland voting by 55% to 45% to remain part of the United Kingdom.\n\n===2015 election===\nThe [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 election]] was held on 7 May 2015 with pre-election polls all predicting a close race and a hung parliament. The surprising result on the night was a clear victory by the Conservative Party: with 37% of the popular vote, they won a narrow overall majority in parliament with 331 of the 650 seats.\n\nThe other most significant result of the election was the [[Scottish National Party]] winning all but three of the 59 seats in Scotland, a gain of 50. This had been widely forecast as opinion polls had recorded a surge in support for the SNP following the 2014 independence referendum, and SNP party membership had more than quadrupled from 25,000 to over 100,000, meaning that 1 in every 50 of the population of Scotland was a party member.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/snp-boost-as-membership-soars-past-100k-mark.1427009904 |work=Glasgow Herald |title=SNP boost as membership soars past 100k mark |publisher=Newsquest |date=22 March 2015 |accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nLabour suffered its worst defeat since 1987, taking only 31% of the votes and losing 40 of its 41 seats in Scotland. The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] lost 49 of their 57 seats, as they were punished for their decision to form a coalition with the conservatives in 2010. The [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), rallying voters against the European Union and against uncontrolled immigration, secured 13% of the vote and came second in over 115 races, but won only one seat in parliament.<ref>see [https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2015-32633099 BBC \"Results\" May 8, 2015]</ref> Cameron had a mandate for his austerity policies to shrink the size of government, and a challenge in dealing with Scotland.<ref>Adam Taylor, \"4 ways the British elections have changed everything\", [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/05/08/4-ways-the-british-elections-have-changed-everything/?hpid=z1 ''Washington Post'' 8 May 2015]</ref> Likewise the Green Party of England and Wales saw a rise in support but retained just its one .\n\n===2016 EU referendum===\n{{main|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Britain Stronger in Europe|Vote Leave|Brexit}}\n[[File:Birmingham Bin-Brexit rally for the Conservative Party conference, September 30, 2018 10.jpg|thumb|A pro-EU demonstration in Birmingham in September 2018]]\nOn 20 February 2016, British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] announced that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union would be held on 23 June 2016, following years of campaigning by [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptics]]. Debates and campaigns by parties supporting both \"Remain\" ([[Britain Stronger in Europe]])and \"Leave\" ([[Vote Leave]]) focused on concerns regarding trade and the [[European Single Market]], security, migration and sovereignty.

However, the actual name of the new state was ''Great Britain''. The name ''Great Britain'' (then sometimes spelled ''Great Brittaine'') was first used by James VI/I in October 1604, who indicated that henceforth he and his successors would be viewed as Kings of Great Britain, not Kings of England and Scotland. However the name was not applied to the ''state'' as a unit; both England and Scotland continued to be governed independently. Its validity as a name of the Crown is also questioned, given that monarchs continued using separate ordinals (e.g., James VI/I, James VII/II) in England and Scotland. To avoid confusion historians generally avoid using the term ''King of Great Britain'' until 1707 and instead to match the ordinal usage call the monarchs kings or queens of England and Scotland. Separate ordinals were abandoned when the two states merged in accordance with the [[Acts of Union 1707]], with subsequent monarchs using ordinals apparently based on English not Scottish history (it might be argued that the monarchs have simply taken the higher ordinal, which to date has always been English). One example is Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]], who is referred to as being \"the Second\" even though there never was an Elizabeth I of Scotland or Great Britain. Thus the term ''Great Britain'' is generally used from 1707.</ref> Of this new [[State (polity)|state]] the historian [[Simon Schama]] said: {{quotation|What began as a hostile merger would end in a full partnership in the most powerful [[going concern]] in the world... it was one of the most astonishing transformations in [[History of Europe|European history]].|sign=Simon Schama|source=<ref>{{cite episode|title=Britannia Incorporated |series=A History of Britain|serieslink=Simon Schama's A History of Britain|credits=[[Simon Schama]] (presenter) |network=[[BBC One]]|airdate=22 May 2001|number=10|minutes= 3}}</ref>}} The [[Act of Union 1800]] added the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] to create the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nThe first decades were marked by [[Jacobite risings]] which ended with defeat for the Stuart cause at the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. In 1763, [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|victory in the Seven Years' War]] led to the growth of the [[First British Empire]]. With defeat by the United States, France and Spain in the [[War of American Independence]], Britain lost its 13 American colonies and rebuilt a [[Second British Empire]] based in Asia and Africa. As a result [[culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]], and its technological, political, constitutional, and linguistic influence, became worldwide. Politically the central event was the [[French Revolution]] and its Napoleonic aftermath from 1793 to 1815, which British elites saw as a profound threat, and worked energetically to form multiple coalitions that finally defeated Napoleon in 1815. The [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]], who came to power in 1783, remained in power (with a short interruption) until 1830. Forces of reform, often emanating from the Evangelical religious elements, opened decades of political reform that broadened the ballot, and opened the economy to free trade. The outstanding political leaders of the 19th century included Palmerston, Disraeli, Gladstone, and Salisbury. Culturally the [[Victorian era]] was a time of prosperity and dominant middle-class virtues when Britain dominated the world economy and maintained a generally peaceful century, 1815\u20131914. The [[First World War]] (1914\u20131918), with Britain in alliance with France, Russia and the United States, was a furious but ultimately successful total war with Germany. The resulting [[League of Nations]] was a favourite project in [[Interwar Britain]]. However, while the Empire remained strong, as did the [[London Stock Exchange|London financial markets]], the British industrial base began to slip behind Germany and, especially, the United States. Sentiments for peace were so strong that the nation supported appeasement of Hitler's Germany in the late 1930s, until the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939 started the [[Second World War]]. In the Second World War France, the Soviet Union and the U.S. joined Britain as [[Allies of World War II|the main Allied powers]].\n\nBritain was no longer a military or economic superpower, as seen in the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956. Britain no longer had the wealth to maintain an empire, so it granted independence to almost all its possessions. The new states typically joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. The postwar years saw great hardships, alleviated somewhat by large-scale financial aid from the United States, and some from Canada. Prosperity returned in the 1950s. Meanwhile, in 1945\u201350 the Labour Party built a welfare state, nationalized many industries, and created the [[National Health Service]]. The UK took a strong stand against Communist expansion after 1945, playing a major role in the [[Cold War]] and the formation of [[NATO]] as an anti-Soviet military alliance with West Germany, France, the U.S., Canada and smaller countries. [[NATO]] remains a powerful military coalition. The UK has been a leading member of the [[United Nations]] since its founding, as well as numerous other international organizations. In the 1990s neoliberalism led to the privatisation of nationalized industries and significant deregulation of business affairs. London's status as a world financial hub grew continuously. Since the 1990s large-scale [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution movements in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales]] have decentralized political decision-making. Britain has moved back and forth on its economic relationships with Western Europe. It joined the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973, thereby weakening economic ties with its Commonwealth. However, the [[Brexit]] referendum in 2016 committed the UK to leave the [[European Union]], which it did in 2020.\n\nIn 1922, Catholic Ireland seceded to become the [[Irish Free State]]; a day later, [[Northern Ireland]] seceded from the Free State and returned to the United Kingdom. In 1927 the United Kingdom changed its formal title to the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uk.html|title=The World Factbook \u2013 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}</ref> usually shortened to ''[[British Isles (terminology)|Britain]]'' and (after 1945) to the ''United Kingdom'' or ''UK''.\n\n==18th century==\n{{main|Early Modern Britain|Georgian era}}\n\n===Birth of the Union===\n{{main|Treaty of Union|Acts of Union 1707}}\n{{See also|Union of the Crowns|History of the formation of the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Articles of Union 1707.jpg|thumb|\"Articles of Union with Scotland\", 1707]]\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] came into being on 1 May 1707, as a result of the [[political union]] of the [[Kingdom of England]] (which included [[Wales]]) and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] under the [[Treaty of Union]]. This combined the two kingdoms into a single kingdom, and merged the two parliaments into a single [[parliament of Great Britain]]. [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] became the first monarch of the new Great Britain. Although now a single kingdom, certain institutions of Scotland and England remained separate, such as [[Scots Law|Scottish]] and [[English law]]; and the [[Presbyterian]] [[Church of Scotland]] and the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Church of England]]. England and Scotland each also continued to have their own system of education.\n\nMeanwhile, the long [[War of the Spanish Succession]] against France (1701\u20131714) was under way. It see-sawed back and forth until a more peace-minded government came to power in London and the treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastadt]] in 1713\u20131714 ended the war. British historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] argues: {{Quote|That Treaty [of Utrecht], which ushered in the stable and characteristic period of Eighteenth-Century civilization, marked the end of danger to Europe from the old French monarchy, and it marked a change of no less significance to the world at large,\u2014the maritime, commercial and financial supremacy of Great Britain.<ref>G.M.

The Elector of Hanover became king as [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] (1714\u20131727). He paid more attention to Hanover and surrounded himself with Germans, making him an unpopular king.<ref>Frank O'Gorman, \"The Recent Historiography of the Hanoverian Regime.\" ''Historical Journal'' 29#4 (1986): 1005\u20131020.</ref> He did, however, build up the army and created a more stable political system in Britain and helped bring peace to northern Europe.<ref>G.C.

The [[South Sea Bubble]] was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The South Sea Company was a joint-stock company in London. Its ostensible object was to grant trade monopolies in South America; but its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to \u00a331&nbsp;million through [[market manipulation]] and speculation. It raised money four times in 1720 by issuing stock, which was purchased by about 8,000 investors. The share price kept soaring every day, from \u00a3130 a share to \u00a31,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places\u2014even to the king. [[Robert Walpole]] managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.<ref>Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689\u20131727'' (2000) pp.&nbsp;334\u201338</ref><ref>Julian Hoppit, \"The Myths of the South Sea Bubble\", ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'', December 1962, Vol. 12 Issue 1, pp.&nbsp;141\u201365. {{doi|10.1017/S0080440102000051}}. {{JSTOR|3679343}}.</ref>\n\n===Robert Walpole===\nRobert Walpole is now generally regarded as the first Prime Minister, from, 1719\u201342, and indeed he invented the role.{{dubious|date=September 2018}} The term was applied to him by friends and foes alike by 1727. Historian Clayton Roberts summarizes his new functions: \n: He monopolized the counsels of the King, he closely superintended the administration, he ruthlessly controlled patronage, and he led the predominant party in Parliament.<ref>Quoted in Stephen Taylor, \"Walpole, Robert, first earl of Orford (1676\u20131745)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/28601, accessed 15 Sept 2017]</ref>\nWalpole was a master of the effective use of patronage, as were his two disciples who succeeded him as prime minister, [[Henry Pelham]] (1743\u20131754) and Pelham's brother the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]] (1754\u20131762).<ref>Reed Browning, ''Duke of Newcastle'' (1975) pp.&nbsp;254\u201360.</ref>\n\n===Moralism, benevolence and hypocrisy===\n[[File:Four Times of the Day - Morning - Hogarth.jpg|thumb|[[18th-century London]] by [[William Hogarth]]]]\nHypocrisy became a major topic in English political history in the early 18th century. The [[Toleration Act 1689]] allowed for certain rights for religious minorities, but Protestant [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]] (such as Congregationalists and Baptists) were still deprived of important rights, such as the right to hold office. Nonconformists who wanted to hold office ostentatiously took the Anglican sacrament once a year in order to avoid the restrictions. High Church Anglicans were outraged. They outlawed what they called \"occasional conformity\" in 1711 with the [[Occasional Conformity Act 1711]].<ref>Clyve Jones, \"'Too Wild to Succeed': The Occasional Conformity Bills and the Attempts by the House of Lords to Outlaw the Tack in the Reign of Anne.\" ''Parliamentary History'' 30.3 (2011): 414\u2013427.</ref> In the political controversies using sermons, speeches, and pamphlet wars, both high churchmen and Nonconformists attacked their opponents as insincere and hypocritical, as well as dangerously zealous, in contrast to their own moderation. This campaign of moderation versus zealotry peaked in 1709 during the impeachment trial of high church preacher [[Henry Sacheverell]]. Historian Mark Knights argues that by its very ferocity, the debate may have led to more temperate and less hypercharged political discourse. \"Occasional conformity\" was restored by the Whigs when they returned to power in 1719.<ref>Mark Knights, \"Occasional conformity and the representation of dissent: hypocrisy, sincerity, moderation and zeal.\" ''Parliamentary History'' 24#1 (2005): 41\u201357.</ref>\n\nEnglish author [[Bernard Mandeville]]'s famous \"[[Fable of the Bees]]\" (1714) explored the nature of hypocrisy in contemporary European society. On one hand, Mandeville was a \"moralist\" heir to the French Augustinianism of the previous century, viewing sociability as a mere mask for vanity and pride. On the other, he was a \"materialist\" who helped found modern economics. He tried to demonstrate the universality of human appetites for corporeal pleasures. He argued that the efforts of self-seeking entrepreneurs are the basis of emerging commercial and industrial society, a line of thought that influenced [[Adam Smith]] (1723\u20131790) and 19th-century [[Utilitarianism]]. A tension arose between these two approaches  concerning the relative power of norms and interests, the relationship between motives and behaviour, and the historical variability of human cultures.<ref>Daniel Luban, \"Bernard Mandeville as Moralist and Materialist.\" ''History of European Ideas'' 41.7 (2015): 831\u2013857.</ref>\n\nFrom around 1750 to 1850, Whig aristocrats in England boasted of their special benevolence for the common people. They claimed to be guiding and counselling reform initiatives to prevent the outbreaks of popular discontent that caused instability and revolution across Europe. However Tory and radical critics accused the Whigs of hypocrisy\u2014alleging they were deliberately using the slogans of reform and democracy to boost themselves into power while preserving their precious aristocratic exclusiveness. Historian L.G. Mitchell defends the Whigs, pointing out that thanks to them radicals always had friends at the centre of the political elite, and thus did not feel as marginalised as in most of Europe. He points out that the debates on the 1832 Reform Bill showed that reformers would indeed receive a hearing at parliamentary level with a good chance of success.<ref>L.G. Mitchell, \"The Whigs, the People, and Reform\", ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' (1999), Vol. 85, pp.&nbsp;25\u201341</ref> Meanwhile, a steady stream of observers from the Continent commented on the English political culture. Liberal and radical observers noted the servility of the English lower classes, the obsession everyone had with rank and title, the extravagance of the aristocracy, a supposed anti-intellectualism, and a pervasive hypocrisy that extended into such areas as social reform. There were not so many conservative visitors. They praised the stability of English society, its ancient constitution, and reverence for the past; they ignored the negative effects of industrialisation.<ref>Paul Langford, \"The English as Reformers: Foreign Visitors' Impressions, 1750\u20131850\" ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' (1999), Vol. 85, pp.&nbsp;101\u2013119.</ref>\n\nHistorians have explored crimes and vices of England's upper classes, especially duelling, suicide, adultery and gambling. They were tolerated by the same courts that executed thousands of poor men and boys for lesser offenses. No aristocrat was punished for killing someone in a duel.  However the emerging popular press specialized in sensationalistic stories about upper-class vice,  which led the middle classes to focus their critiques on a decadent aristocracy that had much more money, but much less morality. than the middle class.<ref>Donna T.

It maintained a relatively large and expensive [[Royal Navy]], along with a small standing army. When the need arose for soldiers it hired mercenaries or financed allies who fielded armies. The rising costs of warfare forced a shift in the sources of government financing, from the income from royal agricultural estates and special imposts and taxes to reliance on customs and excise taxes; and, after 1790, an income tax. Working with bankers in the City, the government raised large loans during wartime and paid them off in peacetime. The rise in taxes amounted to 20% of national income, but the private sector benefited from the increase in economic growth. The demand for war supplies stimulated the industrial sector, particularly naval supplies, munitions and textiles, which gave Britain an advantage in international trade during the postwar years.<ref>Robert M.

Britain was at war against France almost continuously from 1793 until the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815. Conservatives castigated every radical opinion in Britain as \"Jacobin\" (in reference to the [[Jacobin|leaders of the Terror]]), warning that radicalism threatened an upheaval of British society. The Anti-Jacobin sentiment, well expressed by [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Anti-Jacobin|many popular writers]] was strongest among the landed gentry and the upper classes.<ref>Gregory Fremont-Barnes, ed.

The signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] had important consequences for Britain and its empire. In North America, France's future as a colonial power there was effectively ended with the ceding of [[New France]] to Britain (leaving a sizeable French-speaking population under British control) and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] to Spain. Spain ceded [[Florida]] to Britain. In India, the [[Carnatic Wars#Third Carnatic War (1756\u20131763)|Carnatic War]] had left France still in control of its [[French India|enclaves]] but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, effectively leaving the future of India to Britain. [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|The British victory over France]] in the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's dominant colonial power.<ref>Maya Jasanoff, ''Edge of Empire: Lives, Culture, and Conquest in the East, 1750\u20131850'' (2006) p.&nbsp;21</ref>\n\nDuring the 1760s and 1770s, relations between the [[Thirteen Colonies]] and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of opposition to Parliament's repeated attempts to tax American colonists without their consent.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ferguson|last=Niall|title=Empire|publisher=Penguin|year=2004|pages=73}}</ref> Disagreement turned to violence and in 1775 the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. In 1776 the Patriots expelled royal officials and [[United States Declaration of Independence|declared the independence of the United States of America]]. After capturing a British invasion army in 1777, the US formed an alliance with France (and in turn Spain aided France), evening out the military balance. The British army controlled only a handful of coastal cities. 1780\u201381 was a low point for Britain. Taxes and deficits were high, government corruption was pervasive, and the war in America was entering its sixth year with no apparent end in sight. The [[Gordon Riots]] erupted in London during the spring of 1781, in response to increased concessions to Catholics by Parliament. In October 1781 [[Lord Cornwallis]] surrendered his army at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown, Virginia]]. The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed in 1783, formally terminating the war and recognising the independence of the United States.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''Crisis of Empire: Britain and America in the Eighteenth Century'' (2010)</ref>\n\n[[File:Surrender of General Burgoyne.jpg|thumb|British general John Burgoyne shown surrendering at Saratoga (1777), ''[[Surrender of General Burgoyne]]'' painting by [[John Trumbull]] 1822]]\nThe loss of the Thirteen Colonies, at the time Britain's most populous colonies, marked the transition between the \"first\" and \"second\" empires,<ref>{{cite book|first=Pagden|last=Anthony|title=The Origins of Empire, The Oxford History of the British Empire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|pages=92}}</ref> in which Britain shifted its attention to Asia, the Pacific and later Africa. [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that [[free trade]] should replace the old [[mercantilist]] policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal. The growth of trade between the newly independent United States and Britain after 1783<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Lawrence|title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire|year=2001|publisher=Abacus|pages=119}}</ref> confirmed Smith's view that political control was not necessary for economic success.\n\nDuring its first 100 years of operation, the focus of the [[British East India Company]] had been trade, not the building of an empire in India. Company interests turned from trade to territory during the 18th century as the Mughal Empire declined in power and the British East India Company struggled with its French counterpart, the ''[[French East India Company|La Compagnie fran\u00e7aise des Indes orientales]]'', during the [[Carnatic Wars]] of the 1740s and 1750s. The British, led by [[Robert Clive]], defeated the French and their Indian allies in the [[Battle of Plassey]], leaving the Company in control of [[Bengal]] and a major military and political power in India. In the following decades it gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or indirectly via local puppet rulers under the threat of force of the [[Indian Army]], 80% of which was composed of native Indian [[sepoys]].\n\n[[File:Cookroutes.png|thumb|Voyages of the explorer James Cook]]\nOn 22 August 1770, [[James Cook]] discovered the eastern coast of Australia<ref>{{cite book|last=Knibbs|first=Sir George Handley|author2=Commonwealth Bureau of Census|title=Official year book of the Commonwealth of Australia|year=1908|publisher=Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics|page=52}}</ref> while on a scientific [[First voyage of James Cook|voyage]] to the South Pacific.

But the following January, [[Louis XVI]] was beheaded. This combined with a threatened invasion of the Netherlands by France spurred Britain to declare war. For the next 23 years, the two nations were at war except for a short period in 1802\u20131803. Britain alone among the nations of Europe never submitted to or formed an alliance with France. Throughout the 1790s, the British repeatedly defeated the navies of France and its allies, but were unable to perform any significant land operations. An Anglo-Russian invasion of the Netherlands in 1799 accomplished little except the capture of the Dutch fleet.\n\nAt the threshold to the 19th century, Britain was challenged again by France under [[Napoleon]], in a struggle that, unlike previous wars, represented a contest of ideologies between the two nations: the constitutional monarchy of Great Britain versus the liberal principles of the French Revolution ostensibly championed by the Napoleonic empire.<ref>{{cite book|last=James|first=Lawrence|title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire|year=2001|publisher=Abacus|pages=152}}</ref> It was not only Britain's position on the world stage that was threatened: Napoleon threatened invasion of Britain itself, and with it, a fate similar to the countries of continental Europe that his armies had overrun.\n\n==1800 to 1837==\n{{main|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland}}\n{{further|Georgian era|British Regency|Victorian era|British Empire|History of British society#Georgian society}}\n\n===Union with Ireland===\n{{image frame|width=220|border=no|content=[[File:Flags of the Union Jack.svg|220px]]|caption=The [[Flag of the United Kingdom]] is based on the flags of [[Flag of England|England]], [[Flag of Scotland|Scotland]] and the [[saltire]] of the [[Order of St Patrick]] (not the [[flag of Ireland]])}}\n{{main|Act of Union 1800|Irish issue in British politics}}\nOn 1 January 1801, the first day of the 19th century, the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] joined to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nThe legislative union of Great Britain and Ireland was brought about by the Act of Union 1800, creating the \"[[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]\". The Act was passed in both the Parliament of Great Britain and the [[Parliament of Ireland]], dominated by the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and lacking representation of the country's [[Roman Catholic]] population. Substantial majorities were achieved, and according to contemporary documents this was assisted by [[bribery]] in the form of the awarding of [[peerage]]s and [[British honours system|honours]] to opponents to gain their votes.<ref>Alan J. Ward, ''The Irish Constitutional Tradition'' p.&nbsp;28.</ref> Under the terms of the merger, the separate Parliaments of [[Parliament of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Parliament of Ireland|Ireland]] were abolished, and replaced by a united [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Ireland thus became an integral part of the United Kingdom, sending around 100 MPs to the House of Commons at Westminster and 28 [[representative peers]] to the House of Lords, elected from among their number by the Irish peers themselves, except that Roman Catholic peers were not permitted to take their seats in the Lords. Part of the trade-off for the Irish Catholics was to be the granting of [[Catholic Emancipation]], which had been fiercely resisted by the all-Anglican Irish Parliament. However, this was blocked by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], who argued that emancipating the Roman Catholics would breach his [[Coronation Oath]]. The Roman Catholic hierarchy had endorsed the Union. However the decision to block Catholic Emancipation fatally undermined the appeal of the Union.\n\n===Napoleonic wars===\n{{main|The United Kingdom in the Napoleonic Wars}}\nDuring the [[War of the Second Coalition]] (1799\u20131801), Britain occupied most of the French and Dutch colonies (the Netherlands had been a satellite of France since 1796), but tropical diseases claimed the lives of over 40,000 troops. When the Treaty of Amiens created a pause, Britain was forced to return most of the colonies. In May 1803, war was declared again. Napoleon's plans to invade Britain failed due to the inferiority of his navy, and in 1805, Lord Nelson's fleet decisively defeated the French and Spanish at Trafalgar, which was the last significant naval action of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\n[[File:Trafalgar-Auguste Mayer.jpg|thumb|The British {{HMS|Sandwich|1759|6}} fires to the French [[flagship]] {{ship|French ship|Bucentaure|1803|6}} (completely dismasted) into battle off [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]].

This policy aimed to weaken the British export economy closing French-controlled territory to its trade. Napoleon hoped that isolating Britain from the Continent would end its economic dominance. It never succeeded in its objective. Britain possessed the greatest industrial capacity in Europe, and its mastery of the seas allowed it to build up considerable economic strength through trade to its possessions from its rapidly expanding new Empire. Britain's naval supremacy meant that France could never enjoy the peace necessary to consolidate its control over Europe, and it could threaten neither the home islands nor the main British colonies.\n\nThe Spanish uprising in 1808 at last permitted Britain to gain a foothold on the Continent. The Duke of Wellington and his army of British and Portuguese gradually pushed the French out of Spain and in early 1814, as Napoleon was being driven back in the east by the Prussians, Austrians, and Russians, Wellington invaded southern France. After Napoleon's surrender and exile to the island of Elba, peace appeared to have returned, but when he escaped back into France in 1815, the British and their allies had to fight him again. The armies of Wellington and Von Blucher defeated Napoleon once and for all at Waterloo.<ref>Rory Muir, ''Britain and the Defeat of Napoleon, 1807\u20131815'' (Yale University Press, 1996).</ref>\n\n====Financing the war====\nA key element in British success was its ability to mobilize the nation's industrial and financial resources and apply them to defeating France. With a population of 16 million Britain was barely half the size of France with 30&nbsp;million. In terms of soldiers the French numerical advantage was offset by British subsidies that paid for a large proportion of the Austrian and Russian soldiers, peaking at about 450,000 in 1813.<ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers\u2014economic change and military conflict from 1500 to 2000'' (1989), pp. 128\u20139</ref> Most important, the British national output remained strong and the well-organized business sector channeled products into what the military needed. The system of smuggling finished products into the continent undermined French efforts to ruin the British economy by cutting off markets. The British budget in 1814 reached \u00a366&nbsp;million, including \u00a310&nbsp;million for the Navy, \u00a340&nbsp;million for the Army, \u00a310&nbsp;million for the Allies, and \u00a338&nbsp;million as interest on the national debt. The national debt soared to \u00a3679&nbsp;million, more than double the GDP. It was willingly supported by hundreds of thousands of investors and tax payers, despite the higher taxes on land and a new income tax. The whole cost of the war came to \u00a3831&nbsp;million. By contrast the French financial system was inadequate and Napoleon's forces had to rely in part on requisitions from conquered lands.<ref>Elie Halevy, ''A History of the English People in 1815'' (1924) vol 2 pp.&nbsp;205\u20136, 215\u2013228</ref><ref>Roger Knight, ''Britain Against Napoleon: The Organisation of Victory, 1793\u20131815'' (2013)</ref><ref>J.

It forbade the import of British goods into European countries allied with or dependent upon France, and installed the [[Continental System]] in Europe. All connections were to be cut, even the mail.

The \"second war of independence\" for the American, it was little noticed in Britain, where all attention was focused on the struggle with France. The British could devote few resources to the conflict until the fall of Napoleon in 1814. American [[frigate]]s also inflicted a series of embarrassing defeats on the British navy, which was short on manpower due to the conflict in Europe. A stepped-up war effort that year brought about some successes such as the burning of Washington, but many influential voices such as the Duke of Wellington argued that an outright victory over the US was impossible.<ref>Jeremy Black, ''The War of 1812 in the Age of Napoleon'' (2009) is one of the few major British studies</ref>\n\nPeace was agreed to at the end of 1814, but [[Andrew Jackson]], unaware of this, won a great victory over the British at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in January 1815 (news took several weeks to cross the Atlantic before the advent of steam ships). Ratification of the Treaty of Ghent ended the war in February 1815. The major result was the permanent defeat of the Indian allies the British had counted upon. The US-Canada border was demilitarised by both countries, and peaceful trade resumed, although worries of an American conquest of Canada persisted into the 1860s.\n\n==Postwar reaction: 1815\u20131822==\nThe postwar era was a time of economic depression, poor harvests, growing inflation, and high unemployment among returning soldiers.  As industrialisation progressed, Britain was more urban and less rural, and power shifted accordingly.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''The Age of Improvement 1783\u20131867'' (1959).</ref>  The dominant Tory leadership, based in the declining rural sector, was fearful, reactionary and repressive. Tories feared the possible emergence of radicals who might be conspiring to emulate the dreaded [[French Revolution]].  In reality the violent radical element was small and weak; there were a handful of small conspiracies involving men with few followers and careless security; they were quickly suppressed.<ref>Eric J. Evans, ''Britain Before the Reform Act: Politics and Society 1815\u20131832'' (1989) pp 1\u201327.</ref>  Techniques of repression included the suspension of Habeas Corpus in 1817 (allowing the government to arrest and hold suspects without cause or trial).  Sidmouth's Gagging Acts of 1817 heavily muzzled the opposition newspapers; the reformers switched to pamphlets and sold 50,000 a week.   In reaction to the [[Peterloo massacre]] of 1819, the Liverpool government passed the \"[[Six Acts]]\" in 1819. They prohibited drills and military exercises; facilitated warrants for the search for weapons; outlawed public meetings of more than 50 people, including meetings to organize petitions; put heavy penalties on blasphemous and seditious publications; imposing a fourpenny stamp act on many pamphlets to cut down the flow on news and criticism. Offenders could be harshly punished including exile in Australia. In practice the laws were designed to deter troublemakers and reassure conservatives; they were not often used.  By the end of the 1820s, along with a general economic recovery, many of these repressive laws were repealed and in 1828 new legislation guaranteed the civil rights of religious dissenters.<ref>Philip Ziegler, ''Addington'' (1965) p 350</ref>\n\nA weak ruler as regent (1811\u201320) and king (1820\u201330), [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] let his ministers take full charge of government affairs, playing a far lesser role than his father, George III. The principle now became established that the king accepts as prime minister the person who wins a majority in the House of Commons, whether the king personally favours him or not. His governments, with little help from the king, presided over victory in the Napoleonic Wars, negotiated the peace settlement, and attempted to deal with the social and economic malaise that followed.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = Kenneth | year = 2005 | title = George IV: a Sketch | url = | journal = History Today | volume = 55 | issue = 10| pages = 30\u201336 }}</ref> His brother [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] ruled (1830\u201337), but was little involved in politics.

[[Catholic emancipation]] was secured in the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]], which removed the most substantial restrictions on Roman Catholics in Britain.<ref name=\"L. Woodward, 1938 pp 325\u201330\">E. L. Woodward, ''The Age of Reform, 1815\u20131870'' (1938), pp.&nbsp;325\u201330</ref>\n\nThe Whigs became champions of Parliamentary reform. They made [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] prime minister 1830\u20131834, and the [[Reform Act 1832]] became their signature measure. It broadened the franchise slightly and ended the system of [[rotten and pocket boroughs]] (where elections were controlled by powerful families), and gave seats to new industrial centres.  The aristocracy continued to dominate the government, the Army and Royal Navy, and high society.<ref name=\"L. Woodward, 1938 pp 325\u201330\"/> After parliamentary investigations demonstrated the horrors of child labour, limited reforms were passed in 1833.\n\n[[Chartism]] emerged after the 1832 Reform Bill failed to give the vote to the working class. Activists denounced the 'betrayal' of the working class and the 'sacrificing' of their interests by the 'misconduct' of the government. In 1838, Chartists issued the People's Charter demanding manhood suffrage, equal sized election districts, voting by ballots, payment of MPs (so poor men could serve), annual Parliaments, and abolition of property requirements. Elites saw the movement as pathological, so the Chartists were unable to force serious constitutional debate. Historians see Chartism as both a continuation of the 18th-century fight against corruption and as a new stage in demands for democracy in an industrial society.<ref>Malcolm Chase, ''Chartism: A New History'' (2007)</ref>\n\nIn 1832, Parliament abolished slavery in the Empire with the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833]]. The government purchased the slaves for \u00a320,000,000 (the money went to rich plantation owners who mostly lived in England), and freed the slaves, especially those in the Caribbean sugar islands.<ref>E.

Her long reign until 1901 saw Britain reach the zenith of its economic and political power. Exciting new technologies such as steam ships, railroads, photography, and telegraphs appeared, making the world much faster-paced. Britain again remained mostly inactive in Continental politics, and it was not affected by the wave of revolutions in 1848. The Victorian era saw the fleshing out of the second [[British Empire]]. Scholars debate whether the Victorian period\u2014as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political concerns that have come to be associated with the Victorians\u2014actually begins with her coronation or the earlier passage of the [[Reform Act 1832]]. The era was preceded by the [[Regency era]] and succeeded by the [[Edwardian period]].\n\nHistorians like Bernard Porter have characterized the mid-Victorian era, (1850\u20131870) as Britain's 'Golden Years.'.<ref>Bernard Porter, ''Britannia's Burden: The Political Evolution of Modern Britain 1851\u20131890'' (1994) ch 3</ref> There was peace and prosperity, as the national income per person grew by half. Much of the prosperity was due to the increasing industrialization, especially in textiles and machinery, as well as to the worldwide network of trade and engineering that produce profits for British merchants and experts from across the globe. There was peace abroad (apart from the short Crimean war, 1854\u201356), and social peace at home.  Reforms in industrial conditions were set by Parliament.  For example, in 1842, the nation was scandalized by the use of children in coal mines. The [[Mines and Collieries Act 1842|Mines Act of 1842]] banned employment of girls and boys under ten years old from working underground in coal mines.<ref>Lionel Rose, ''The Erosion of Childhood: Childhood in Britain 1860\u20131918'' (1991) p 11.</ref>  Opposition to the new order melted away, says Porter. The Chartist movement, peaked as a democratic movement among the working class in 1848; its leaders moved to other pursuits, such as trade unions and cooperative societies. The working class ignored foreign agitators like Karl Marx in their midst, and joined in celebrating the new prosperity. Employers typically were paternalistic, and generally recognized the trade unions.<ref>F. M. L. Thompson, ''Rise of Respectable Society: A Social History of Victorian Britain, 1830\u20131900'' (1988) pp.&nbsp;211\u201314</ref> Companies provided their employees with welfare services ranging from housing, schools and churches, to libraries, baths, and gymnasia. Middle-class reformers did their best to assist the working classes aspire to middle-class norms of 'respectability.'\n\nThere was a spirit of libertarianism, says Porter, as people felt they were free. Taxes were very low, and government restrictions were minimal. There were still problem areas, such as occasional riots, especially those motivated by anti-Catholicism. Society was still ruled by the aristocracy and the gentry, which controlled high government offices, both houses of Parliament, the church, and the military. Becoming a rich businessman was not as prestigious as inheriting a title and owning a landed estate. Literature was doing well, but the fine arts languished as the Great Exhibition of 1851 showcased Britain's industrial prowess rather than its sculpture, painting or music. The educational system was mediocre; the capstone universities (outside Scotland) were likewise mediocre.<ref>Porter, ch 1\u20133; K Theodore Hoppen, ''The Mid-Victorian Generation: 1846\u20131886'' (1998), ch 1 to 3, 9\u201311</ref>\nHistorian [[Llewellyn Woodward]] has concluded:<ref>Llewellyn Woodward, ''The Age of Reform, 1815\u20131870'' (2nd ed. 1962) p.&nbsp;629</ref>\n: For leisure or work, for getting or spending, England was a better country in 1879 than in 1815. The scales were less weighted against the weak, against women and children, and against the poor. There was greater movement, and less of the fatalism of an earlier age. The public conscience was more instructed, and the content of liberty was being widened to include something more than freedom from political constraint.... Yet England in 1871 was by no means an earthly paradise. The housing and conditions of life of the working class in town & country were still a disgrace to an age of plenty.\n\n===Social and cultural history===\n{{main|Victorian era}}\n\n===Foreign policy===\n{{Main|International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)}}\n\n====Free trade imperialism====\nThe Great London Exhibition of 1851 clearly demonstrated Britain's dominance in engineering and industry; that lasted until the rise of the United States and Germany in the 1890s.

Prince Albert was effective in defusing a [[Trent Affair|war scare in late 1861]]. The British people, who depended heavily on American food imports, generally favoured the United States. What little cotton was available came from New York, as the blockade by the US Navy shut down 95% of Southern exports to Britain. In September 1862, Britain (along with France) contemplated stepping in and negotiating a peace settlement, which could only mean war with the United States. But in the same month, US president [[Abraham Lincoln]] announced the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] would be issued in January 1863 making abolition of slavery in the Confederacy a war goal. Since support of the Confederacy now meant support for slavery, there was no longer any possibility of European intervention. However, the British working class were quite overwhelmingly pro-Union. In the end, although Britain could survive without Southern cotton, the North's meat and grain was more important to feed the UK's urban population, especially as a series of bad harvests had affected British agriculture in the late 1850s to early 1860s.<ref>Amanda Foreman, ''A World on Fire: Britain's Crucial Role in the American Civil War'' (2012)</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the British sold arms to both sides, built [[blockade runner]]s for a lucrative trade with the Confederacy, and surreptitiously allowed warships to be built for the Confederacy. The warships caused a major diplomatic row that was resolved in the [[Alabama Claims]] in 1872, in the Americans' favour.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Frank J. Merli|author2=David M.

Britain handled foreign policy and defence. The second half of the 19th century saw a major expansion of Britain's colonial empire in Asia and Africa as well as the Pacific . In the \"[[Scramble for Africa]]\", the boast was having the Union Jack flying from \"Cairo to Cape Town.\" Britain defended its empire with the world's dominant navy, and a small professional army. It was the only power in Europe to have no conscription.<ref>P.J. Marshall, ed., ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the British Empire'' (1996). [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521432115 online]</ref>\n\nThe rise of the [[German Empire]] after 1871 posed a new challenge, for it (along with the United States) threatened to take Britain's place as the world's foremost industrial power. Germany acquired a number of colonies in Africa and the Pacific, but Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] succeeded in achieving general peace through his balance of power strategy. When [[William II, German Emperor|William II]] became emperor in 1888, he discarded Bismarck, began using bellicose language, and planned to build a navy to rival Britain's.<ref>A.J.P. Taylor, ''The Struggle for Mastery in Europe: 1848\u20131918'' (1953) ch 12</ref>\n\n===Boer War===\n{{Main|Second Boer War}}\n[[File:Battles of the nineteenth century (1901) (14595628519).jpg|thumb|[[Siege of Ladysmith]] in South Africa]]\nEver since Britain had taken control of South Africa from the Netherlands in the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it had run afoul of the Dutch settlers who further away and created two republics of their own. The British imperial vision called for control over the new countries and the Dutch-speaking \"Boers\" (or \"[[Afrikaners]]\") fought back in the [[Second Boer War|War in 1899\u20131902]]. British historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] argues that the Boers insisted on keeping full control of both their two small republics, allowing no role whatever for nonwhites, and distinctly limited roles for British and other European settlers. These \"[[Uitlander]]s\" were the base of the economy, paid 80 percent of the taxes, and had no vote. The Transvaal was in no sense a democracy, argues Roberts, for no black, Britain, Catholic or Jew was allowed to vote or hold any office. Johannesburg was the business centre, with 50,000 primarily British residents, but was not permitted any local government. The English language was banned in official proceedings; no public meetings were permitted; newspapers were closed down arbitrarily; and full citizenship was technically possible but quite rare. Roberts says President [[Paul Kruger]] \"ran a tight, tough, quasi-police state from his state capital, Pretoria.\" the British government officially protested; while theoretically recognizing the Transvaal's right to manage its internal affairs, cabinet member [[Joseph Chamberlain]] detailed the many ways how Uitlanders were mistreated as second-class non-citizens, despite their essential role in producing prosperity.<ref>Andrew Roberts, ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples Since 1900'' (2008), pp. 27\u201329.</ref>\n\nThe Boer response to the British pressure was to declare war on 20 October 1899. The 410,000 Boers were massively outnumbered, but amazingly they waged a successful guerrilla war, which gave the British regulars a difficult fight. The Boers were landlocked and did not have access to outside help.  The weight of numbers, superior equipment, and often brutal tactics eventually brought about a British victory. To defeat the guerrillas, the British rounded up their women and children into concentration camps, where many died of disease. World outrage focused on the camps, led by a large faction of the Liberal Party in Britain. However, the United States gave its support. The Boer republics were merged into [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910; it had internal self-government but its foreign policy was controlled by London and was an integral part of the British Empire.<ref>Denis Judd and Keith Surridge, ''The Boer War: A History'' (2002)</ref>\n[[File:The Second Anglo - Boer War, South Africa 1899 - 1902 ZZZ7150D.jpg|thumb|A group of British prisoners, with [[Winston Churchill]] on the right]]\nThe unexpectedly great difficulty in defeating the Boers forced a reevaluation of British policy. In military terms, it was clear that the Cardwell reforms had been inadequate. The call to establish a general staff to control military operations had been shelved by the Duke of Cambridge, himself a royal with enormous authority. It took a five more years to set up a general staff and other Army reforms, under the administration of [[Lord Haldane]].<ref>A.J.

Gladstone denounced Disraeli's policies of territorial aggrandizement, military pomp, and imperial symbolism (such as making the Queen Empress of India), saying it did not fit a modern commercial and Christian nation.\n\nIn foreign policy he is best known for battling and besting Russia. Disraeli's second term was dominated by the [[Eastern Question]]\u2014the slow decay of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the desire of Russia, to gain at its expense. Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the [[Suez Canal Company]] (in Ottoman-controlled Egypt). In 1878, faced with Russian victories against the Ottomans, he worked at the [[Congress of Berlin]] to maintain peace in the Balkans and made terms favourable to Britain which weakened Russia, its longstanding enemy.<ref>Marvin Swartz, ''The Politics of British Foreign Policy in the Era of Disraeli & Gladstone'' (1985)</ref>\n\nDisraeli's old reputation as the \"Tory democrat\" and promoter of the welfare state has faded as historians argue that he had few proposals for social legislation in 1874\u201380, and that the 1867 Reform Act did not reflect a vision for the unenfranchised working man.<ref>Maurice Cowling, ''1867: Disraeli, Gladstone and revolution'' (1967).</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen J.

Gladstone's first ministry saw many reforms including Disestablishment of the Protestant [[Church of Ireland]] and the introduction of [[Ballot Act 1872|secret voting]]. His party was defeated in 1874, but made a comeback based on opposition to Turkey's [[Bulgarian atrocities]] against Christians. Gladstone's [[Midlothian Campaign]] of 1879\u201380 was an pathbreaking introduction of many modern political campaigning techniques. His Liberal party was increasingly pulled apart on the Irish issue. He proposed Irish [[home rule]] in 1886; It failed to pass and the resulting split in the Liberal Party kept it out of office for most of the next 20 years.\n\nGladstone's financial policies, based on the notion of balanced budgets, low taxes and [[laissez-faire]], were suited to a developing capitalist society but could not respond effectively as economic and social conditions changed. Called the \"Grand Old Man\" later in life, he was always a dynamic popular orator who appealed strongly to British workers and lower middle class. The deeply religious Gladstone brought a new moral tone to politics with his evangelical sensibility and opposition to aristocracy. His moralism often angered his upper-class opponents (including Queen Victoria, who strongly favoured Disraeli), and his heavy-handed control split the Liberal party. His foreign policy goal was to create a European order based on cooperation rather than conflict and mutual trust instead of rivalry and suspicion; the rule of law was to supplant the reign of force and self-interest. This Gladstonian concept of a harmonious [[Concert of Europe]] was opposed to and ultimately defeated by the Germans with a [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarckian]] system of manipulated alliances and antagonisms.<ref>H.C.G.

It passed the [[Liberal welfare reforms|welfare reforms]] that created a basic British welfare state. It weakened the veto power of Lords, blocked woman suffrage. In 1914 it apparently \"solved\" the problem of Irish Home Rule but when the war broke out the solution was shelved. [[H. H. Asquith]] was Liberal Prime Minister between 1908 and 1916, followed by [[David Lloyd George]], 1916\u201322. Although Asquith was the Party leader, the dominant Liberal was Lloyd George. Asquith was overwhelmed by the wartime role of coalition prime minister, and Lloyd George replaced him as the coalition prime minister in late 1916 but Asquith remained Liberal party leader. The two fought for years over control of the party, badly weakening it in the process.<ref>Michael Fry, \"Political Change in Britain, August 1914 to December 1916: Lloyd George Replaces Asquith: The Issues Underlying the Drama.\" ''Historical Journal'' 31#3 (1988): 609\u2013627.</ref> Historian [[Martin Pugh (author)|Martin Pugh]] in ''The Oxford Companion to British History'' argues that Lloyd George:\n:made a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-century leader, thanks to his pre-war introduction of Britain's social welfare system (especially medical insurance, unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions, largely paid for by taxes on high incomes and on the land).

With the advent of the 20th century, things such as motion pictures, automobiles, and aeroplanes were coming into use. The new century was characterised by a feeling of great optimism. The social reforms of the last century continued into the 20th with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] being formed in 1900. Edward died in 1910, to be succeeded by [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], who reigned 1910\u201336. Scandal-free, hard working and popular, George V was the British monarch who, with Queen Mary, established the modern pattern of exemplary conduct for British royalty, based on middle-class values and virtues. He understood the overseas Empire better than any of his prime ministers and used his exceptional memory for figures and details, whether of uniforms, politics, or relations, to good effect in reaching out in conversation with his subjects.<ref>H.C.G. Matthew, \"George V (1865\u20131936)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', (2004); online edn, January 2008</ref>\n\nThe era was prosperous but political crises were escalating out of control. [[George Dangerfield]] (1935) identified the \"strange death of liberal England\" as the multiple crisis that hit simultaneously in 1910\u20131914 with serious social and political instability arising from the Irish crisis, [[Great Labour Unrest|labour unrest]], the women's suffrage movements, and partisan and constitutional struggles in Parliament. At one point it even seemed the Army might refuse orders dealing with Northern Ireland.<ref>George Dangerfield, ''[[The Strange Death of Liberal England: 1910\u20131914]]'' (1935)</ref> No solution appeared in sight when the unexpected outbreak of the Great War in 1914 put domestic issues on hold.\n\n[[Ross McKibbin]] argues that the political party system of the Edwardian era was in delicate balance on the eve of the war in 1914. The Liberals were in power with a progressive alliance of Labour and, off and on, Irish Nationalists. The coalition was committed to free trade (as opposed to the high tariffs the Conservatives sought), free collective bargaining for trades unions (which Conservatives opposed), an active social policy that was forging the welfare state, and constitutional reform to reduce the power of the House of Lords. The coalition lacked a long-term plan, because it was cobbled together from leftovers from the 1890s. The sociological basis was non-Anglican religion and non-English ethnicity rather than the emerging class conflict emphasized by Labour.<ref>[[Ross McKibbin]], ''Parties and People: England, 1914\u20131951'' (2010)</ref>\n\n===First World War===\n{{main|British entry into World War I|History of the United Kingdom during the First World War}}\nOn 4 August, the King declared war on Germany and Austria, following the advice of Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. The rest of the Empire automatically followed. The cabinet's basic reasons for declaring war focused on a deep commitment to France and avoidance of splitting the Liberal Party. Top Liberals led by Asquith and Foreign Secretary [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] threatened to resign if the cabinet refused to support France. That would deeply split the party and mean loss of control of the government to a coalition or to the Unionist (i.e. Conservative) opposition.  However, the large antiwar element among Liberals, with David Lloyd George as spokesperson, would support the war to honour the 1839 treaty that guaranteed Belgian neutrality. So Belgium rather than France was the public reason given.   Posters took the line that Britain was required to go to war to safeguard Belgium's neutrality under the 1839 [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen J.

The economy grew about 14% from 1914 to 1918 despite the absence of so many men in the services; by contrast the German economy shrank 27%. The War saw a decline of civilian consumption, with a major reallocation to munitions. The government share of GDP soared from 8% in 1913 to 38% in 1918 (compared to 50% in 1943). The war forced Britain to use up its financial reserves and borrow large sums from New York banks. After the U.S. entered in April 1917, the Treasury borrowed directly from the U.S. government.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Stevenson|title=With Our Backs to the Wall: Victory and Defeat in 1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=06KYLGALKNEC&pg=PA370|year=2011|publisher=Harvard U.P.|page=370|isbn=9780674062269}}</ref><ref>Niall Ferguson, ''The Pity of War'' (1998) p.&nbsp;249</ref>\n\nThe Royal Navy dominated the seas, defeating the smaller German fleet in the only major naval battle of the war, the [[Battle of Jutland]] in 1916. Germany was blockaded, leading to an increasing shortage short of food. Germany's naval strategy increasingly turned towards use of [[U-boat]]s to strike back against the British, despite the risk of triggering war with the powerful neutral power, the United States.  Berlin declared the water routes to Britain were war zones where any ship, neutral or otherwise, was a target. nevertheless, international route law required giving the crew and passengers an opportunity to get into their lifeboats.  the U-boat without warning torpedoed the British passenger liner [[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]] in May 1915; it sank in 18 minutes, drowning over 1000 helpless civilians including over 100 Americans. Vigorous protests by American President Woodrow Wilson forced Berlin to abandon unrestricted submarine warfare. With victory over Russia in 1917, the German high command now calculated it could finally have numerical superiority on the Western Front. Planning for a massive spring offensive in 1918, it resumed the sinking of all merchant ships without warning, even if they were flying the American flag. The US entered the war alongside the Allies (without officially joining them), and provided the needed money and supplies to sustain the Allies' war efforts. The U-boat threat was ultimately defeated by a convoy system across the Atlantic.<ref>Paul Halpern, ''A naval history of World War I'' (2012).</ref>\n\nOn other fronts, the British, French, Australians, and Japanese seized Germany's colonies. Britain fought the Ottoman Empire, suffering defeats in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] and in [[Mesopotamia]] (Iraq), while arousing the Arabs who helped expel the Turks from their lands. Exhaustion and [[war-weariness]] were growing worse in 1917, as the fighting in France continued with no end in sight. After defeating Russia, the Germans tried to win in the spring of 1918 before the millions of American soldiers arrived. They failed, and they were overwhelmed by August and finally accepted an Armistice on 11 November 1918, that amounted to a surrender.<ref>Stevenson, ''With our backs to the wall'' (2011), pp.&nbsp;249\u201352, 534\u201344.</ref>\n \nBritish society and government were radically transformed by the repeated calls for manpower, the employment of women, the dramatic increase in industrial production and munitions, price controls and rationing, and the wide and deep emotional patriotism dedicated to winning the war.  Parliament took a backseat, as new departments bureaus committees and operations were created every week, experts were consulted, and the prime minister's [[Order in Council|Orders in Council]] replaced the slow legislative process. Even after peace arrived, the new size and dynamism had permanently transformed the effectiveness of British government.<ref>Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the wars: 1918\u20131940'' (1955) pp.&nbsp;13\u201314.</ref>   David Lloyd George, also a Liberal, was the high-powered Minister of Munitions who replaced Asquith in late 1916. He gave energy and dynamism to the war effort with his remarkable ability to convince people to do what he wanted and thus get ideas put into actual useful high-speed motion. His top aide Winston Churchill said of Lloyd George: \"He was the greatest master of the art of getting things done and of putting things through that I ever knew; in fact no British politician my day has possessed half his competence as a mover of men and affairs.\"<ref>Mowat, ''Britain between the wars: 1918\u20131940'' (1955) p.&nbsp;10.</ref>\n\nVictorian attitudes and ideals that had continued into the first years of the 20th century changed during the First World War.

The [[League of Nations]] was founded with the idea that nations could resolve their differences peacefully, but these hopes were unfulfilled. The harsh peace settlement imposed on Germany would leave it embittered and seeking revenge.\n\nAt the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, Lloyd George, American President Woodrow Wilson and French premier Georges Clemenceau made all the major decisions. They formed the [[League of Nations]] as a mechanism to prevent future wars. They sliced up the losers to form new nations in Europe, and divided up the German colonies and Ottoman holdings outside Turkey. They imposed what appeared to be heavy financial reparations (but in the event were of modest size). They humiliated Germany by forcing it to declare its guilt for starting the war, a policy that caused deep resentment in Germany and helped fuel reactions such as Nazism. Britain gained the German colony of [[Tanganyika]] and part of [[Togoland]] in Africa, while its dominions added other colonies. Britain gained League of Nations mandates over Palestine, which had been partly promised as a homeland for Jewish settlers, and Iraq. Iraq became fully independent in 1932. Egypt, which had been a British protectorate since 1882, became independent in 1922, although the British remained there until 1952.<ref>Alan Sharp, ''The Versailles Settlement: Peacemaking after the First World War, 1919\u20131923'' (2nd ed. 2008)</ref>\n\n===Irish independence and partition===\n{{main|Irish Home Rule bills|Partition of Ireland|Irish Declaration of Independence|Irish War of Independence}}\nIn 1912 the House of Commons passed a new Home Rule bill. Under the [[Parliament Act 1911]] the House of Lords retained the power to delay legislation by up to two years, so it was eventually enacted as the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914]], but suspended for the duration of the war. Civil war threatened when the Protestant-Unionists of Northern Ireland refused to be placed under Catholic-Nationalist control. Semi-military units were formed ready to fight\u2014the [[Irish Unionism|Unionist]] [[Ulster Volunteers]] opposed to the Act and their Nationalist counterparts, the [[Irish Volunteers]] supporting the Act. The outbreak of the World War in 1914 put the crisis on political hold. A disorganized [[Easter Rising]] in 1916 was brutally suppressed by the British, which had the effect of galvanizing Nationalist demands for independence. Prime Minister Lloyd George failed to introduce Home Rule in 1918 and in the December 1918 General Election [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] won a majority of Irish seats. Its MPs refused to take their seats at Westminster, instead choosing to sit in the [[First D\u00e1il]] parliament in Dublin. A declaration of independence was ratified by [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the self-declared Republic's parliament in January 1919. An [[Anglo-Irish War]] was fought between Crown forces and the [[Irish Republican Army (1917\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] between January 1919 and June 1921. The war ended with the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of December 1921 that established the [[Irish Free State]].<ref>Joost Augusteign, ed., ''The Irish revolution, 1913\u20131923'' (Basingstoke, 2002)</ref> Six northern, predominantly Protestant counties became [[History of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] and have remained part of the United Kingdom ever since, despite demands of the Catholic minority to unite with the Republic of Ireland.<ref>Thomas Henessy, ''A History of Northern Ireland, 1920\u20131996'' (1998)</ref> Britain officially adopted the name \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" by the [[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]].\n\n==Interwar era 1918\u20131939==\n<!--linked from [[Template:United Kingdom topics]]-->\n{{Main|Interwar Britain}}\nHistorian [[Arthur Marwick]] sees a radical transformation of British society resulting from the Great War, a deluge that swept away many old attitudes and brought in a more equalitarian society. He sees the famous literary pessimism of the 1920s as misplaced, arguing there were major positive long-term consequences of the war to British society. He points to an energized self-consciousness among workers that quickly built up the Labour Party, the coming of partial woman suffrage, and an acceleration of social reform and state control of the economy. He sees a decline of deference toward the aristocracy and established authority in general, and the weakening among youth of traditional restraints on individual moral behavior. The chaperone faded away; village druggists sold contraceptives. Marwick says that class distinctions softened, national cohesion increased, and British society became more equal.<ref>Arthur Marwick, ''The Deluge: British Society and the First World War'' (1965)</ref>\n\n===Popular culture===\nAs a leisure, literacy, wealth, ease of travel, and a broadened sense of community grew in Britain from the late 19th century onward, there was more time and interest in leisure activities of all sorts, on the part of all classes.<ref name=\"Peter J.

New additions to adult fiction doubled during the 1920s, reaching 2800 new books a year by 1935. Libraries tripled their stock, and saw heavy demand for new fiction.<ref>{{cite journal | authorlink = Basil Cottle | last1 = Cottle | first1 = Basil | year = 1978 | title = Popular Reading And Our Public Libraries: The Abjured Prescription | url = | journal = Library Review | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 222\u2013227 | doi=10.1108/eb012677}}</ref> A dramatic innovation was the inexpensive paperback, pioneered by [[Allen Lane]] (1902\u201370) at [[Penguin Books]] in 1935. The first titles included novels by Ernest Hemingway and Agatha Christie. They were sold cheap (usually sixpence) in a wide variety of inexpensive stores such as Woolworth's.  Penguin aimed at an educated middle class \"middlebrow\" audience. It avoided the downmarket image of American paperbacks. The line signalled cultural self-improvement and political education.<ref>Nicholas Joicey, \"A Paperback Guide to Progress: Penguin Books 1935\u2013c. 1951\" ''Twentieth Century British History'' 4#1 (1993): 25\u201356. {{doi|10.1093/tcbh/4.1.25}}.</ref> However the war years caused a shortage of staff for publishers and book stores, and a severe shortage of rationed paper, worsened by the air raid on [[Paternoster Square]] in 1940 that burned 5 million books in warehouses.<ref>Joseph McAleer, ''Popular Reading and Publishing in Britain: 1914\u20131950'' (1992).</ref>\n\nRomantic fiction was especially popular, with [[Mills and Boon]] the leading publisher.<ref>Joseph McAleer, ''Passion's fortune: the story of Mills & Boon'' (1999).</ref> Romantic encounters were embodied in a principle of sexual purity that demonstrated not only social conservatism, but also how heroines could control their personal autonomy.<ref>Nicola Humble, ''The Feminine Middlebrow Novel, 1920s to 1950s: Class, Domesticity, and Bohemianism'' (2001).</ref><ref>Alison Light, ''Forever England: femininity, literature and conservatism between the wars'' (1991).</ref> Adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by [[DC Thomson]]; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about.

The [[Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1919]] set up a system of government housing that followed the 1918 campaign promises of \"homes fit for heroes.\" This \"Addison Act\", named after the first Minister of Health, [[Christopher Addison]], required local authorities to survey their housing needs and start building houses to replace slums. The Treasury subsidized the low rents. In England and Wales 214,000 houses were built, and the Ministry of Health became largely a ministry of housing.<ref>Charles Loch Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars: 1918\u20131940'' (1955) pp.&nbsp;43\u201346</ref>\n\nThe [[Unemployment Insurance Act 1920]] passed at a time of very little unemployment. It set up the dole system that provided 39 weeks of unemployment benefits to practically the entire civilian working population except domestic service, farm workers, and civil servants. Funded in part by weekly contributions from both employers and employed, it provided weekly payments of 15s for unemployed men and 12s for unemployed women. Historian [[Charles Mowat]] calls these two laws \"Socialism by the back door\", and notes how surprised politicians were when the costs to the Treasury soared during the high unemployment of 1921.<ref>C. L. Mowat, ''Britain between the Wars: 1918\u20131940'' (1955) pp.&nbsp;43\u201346</ref>\n\n===Conservative control===\nThe [[Lloyd George ministry]] fell apart in 1922. [[Stanley Baldwin]], as leader of the Conservative Party (1923\u201337) and as Prime Minister (in 1923\u201324, 1924\u201329 and 1935\u201337), dominated British politics.<ref>Stuart Ball, \"Baldwin, Stanley, first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1867\u20131947)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' 2004; [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/30550, online edn, January 2011] {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/30550}}</ref> His mixture of strong social reforms and steady government proved a powerful election combination, with the result that the Conservatives governed Britain either by themselves or as the leading component of the [[UK National Government|National Government]]. He was the last party leader to win over 50% of the vote (in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1931]]). Baldwin's political strategy was to polarize the electorate so that voters would choose between the Conservatives on the right and the Labour Party on the left, squeezing out the Liberals in the middle.<ref>Andrew J.

Baldwin's reputation soared in the 1920s and 1930s, but crashed after 1945 as he was blamed for the appeasement policies toward Germany, and as admirers of Churchill made him the Conservative icon. Since the 1970s Baldwin's reputation has recovered somewhat.<ref>Philip Williamson, \"Baldwin's Reputation: Politics and History, 1937\u20131967\", ''Historical Journal'' (March 2004) 47#1 pp.&nbsp;127\u201368 {{JSTOR|4091548}}</ref>\n\nLabour won the 1923 election, but in 1924 Baldwin and the Conservatives returned with a large majority.\n\nMcKibbin finds that the political culture of the interwar period was built around an anti-socialist middle class, supported by the Conservative leaders, especially Baldwin.<ref>Ross McKibbin, ''Parties and people: England, 1914\u20131951'' (Oxford, 2010)</ref>\n\n===Economics===\nTaxes rose sharply during the war and never returned to their old levels. A rich man paid 8% of his income in taxes before the war, and about a third afterwards. Much of the money went for the dole, the weekly unemployment benefits. About 5% of the national income every year was transferred from the rich to the poor. [[A. J. P. Taylor]] argues most people \"were enjoying a richer life than any previously known in the history of the world: longer holidays, shorter hours, higher real wages.\"<ref>[[A. J. P. Taylor]], ''English History, 1915\u20131945'' (1965) p.&nbsp;176, quote on p.&nbsp;317</ref>\n\nThe British economy was lackluster in the 1920s, with sharp declines and high unemployment in heavy industry and coal, especially in Scotland and Wales. Exports of coal and steel fell in half by 1939 and the business community was slow to adopt the new labour and management principles coming from the US, such as [[Fordism]], consumer credit, eliminating surplus capacity, designing a more structured management, and using greater economies of scale.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Garside | first1 = W.R. | last2 = Greaves | first2 = J.I. | year = 1997 | title = Rationalisation and Britain's industrial Malaise: The interwar years revisited | url = | journal = Journal of European Economic History | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 37\u201368 }}</ref> For over a century the shipping industry had dominated world trade, but it remained in the doldrums despite various stimulus efforts by the government.

There also remained a strong economic divide between the north and south of England during this period, with the south of England and the Midlands fairly prosperous by the Thirties, while parts of south Wales and the industrial north of England became known as \"distressed areas\" due to particularly high rates of unemployment and poverty. Despite this, the standard of living continued to improve as local councils built [[Council house|new houses]] to let to families rehoused from outdated [[slum]]s, with up to date facilities including indoor toilets, bathrooms and electric lighting now being included in the new properties. The private sector enjoyed a housebuilding boom during the 1930s.<ref name=\"Unstead\">R.J. Unstead, ''A Century of Change: 1837\u2013Today''</ref>\n\n====Labour====\nDuring the war, [[trade unions]] were encouraged and their membership grew from 4.1&nbsp;million in 1914 to 6.5&nbsp;million in 1918. They peaked at 8.3&nbsp;million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4&nbsp;million in 1923.<ref>B.R.

Demand fell as oil began replacing coal for fuel. The [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 general strike]] was a nine-day nationwide walkout of 1.3&nbsp;million railwaymen, transport workers, printers, dockers, iron workers and steelworkers supporting the 1.2&nbsp;million coal miners who had been locked out by the owners. The miners had rejected the owners' demands for longer hours and reduced pay in the face of falling prices.<ref>Medlicott, ''Contemporary England'', pp.&nbsp;223\u201330</ref> The Conservative government had provided a nine-month subsidy in 1925 but that was not enough to turn around a sick industry. To support the miners the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC), an umbrella organization of all trades unions, called out certain critical unions. The hope was the government would intervene to reorganize and rationalize the industry, and raise the subsidy. The Conservative government had stockpiled supplies and essential services continued with middle class volunteers. All three major parties opposed the strike. The Labour Party leaders did not approve and feared it would tar the party with the image of radicalism, for the [[Comintern]] in Moscow had sent instructions for Communists to aggressively promote the strike. The general strike itself was largely non-violent, but the miners' lockout continued and there was violence in Scotland. It was the only general strike in British history, for TUC leaders such as [[Ernest Bevin]] considered it a mistake . Most historians treat it as a singular event with few long-term consequences, but Martin Pugh says it accelerated the movement of working-class voters to the Labour Party, which led to future gains.<ref>Alastair Reid, and Steven Tolliday, \"Review: The General Strike, 1926\", ''The Historical Journal'' (1977) 20#4 pp.&nbsp;1001\u201312 {{JSTOR|2638422}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pugh | first1 = Martin | authorlink = Martin Pugh (author) |year = 2006 | title = The General Strike | url = | journal = [[History Today]] | volume = 56 | issue = 5| pages = 40\u201347 }}</ref> The [[Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927]] made general strikes illegal and ended the automatic payment of union members to the Labour Party. That act was largely repealed in 1946. The coal industry used up the more accessible coal and as costs rose output fell from 2567&nbsp;million tons in 1924 to 183 million in 1945.<ref>B.R.

At the depth in summer 1932, registered unemployed numbered 3.5&nbsp;million, and many more had only part-time employment. Experts tried to remain optimistic.

The challenge came from dictators, first [[Benito Mussolini]] of Italy, then [[Adolf Hitler]] of a much more powerful [[Nazi Germany]]. The [[League of Nations]] proved disappointing to its supporters; it was unable to resolve any of the threats posed by the dictators. British policy was to \"appease\" them in the hopes they would be satiated. By 1938 it was clear that war was looming, and that Germany had the world's most powerful military. The final act of appeasement came when Britain and France sacrificed Czechoslovakia to Hitler's demands at the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>[[David Faber (politician)|David Faber]], ''Munich, 1938: Appeasement and World War II'' (2010)</ref> Instead of satiation Hitler menaced Poland, and at last Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] dropped appeasement and stood firm in promising to defend Poland.

Welfare conditions, especially regarding food, improved during the war as the government imposed rationing and subsidized food prices. Conditions for housing worsened of course with the bombing, and clothing was in short supply.\n\nEquality increased dramatically, as incomes declined sharply for the wealthy and for white collar workers, as their taxes soared, while blue collar workers benefited from rationing and price controls.<ref>Sidney Pollard, ''The development of the British economy 1914\u20131950'' (1962 and later editions) pp.&nbsp;339\u201348</ref>\n\nPeople demanded an expansion of the welfare state as a reward to the people for their wartime sacrifices<ref>F.

It recommended that the various income maintenance services that a grown-up piecemeal since 1911 be systematized and made universal. Unemployment benefits and sickness benefits were to be universal. There would be new benefits for maternity. The old-age pension system would be revised and expanded, and require that a person retired.

They started with the [[Bank of England]], civil aviation, coal, and [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable & Wireless]]. Then came railways, canals, road haulage and trucking, electricity, and gas. Finally came iron and steel, which was a special case because it was a manufacturing industry. Altogether, about one fifth of the economy was nationalised. Labour dropped its plans to nationalise farmlands. The procedure used was developed by [[Herbert Morrison]], who as [[Lord President of the Council]] chaired the Committee on the Socialization of Industries.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} He followed the model that had already been used to establish public corporations such as the [[BBC]] (1927). In exchange for the shares, the owners of the companies were given government bonds paying low rates of interest, and the government took full ownership of each affected company, consolidating it into a national monopoly. The management remained the same, but they were now effectively civil servants working for the government.<ref name=\"auto\">Alan Sked and Chris Cook, ''Post-War Britain: A Political History'' (1979) pp.&nbsp;31\u201334</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">Samuel H. Beer, ''British Politics in the Collectivist Age'' (1965) pp.&nbsp;188\u2013216</ref>\n \nFor the Labour Party leadership, nationalisation was a way to consolidate economic planning in their own hands. It was not designed to modernise old industries, make them efficient, or transform their organisational structure. There was no money for modernisation, although the [[Marshall Plan]], operated separately by American planners, did force many British businesses to adopt modern managerial techniques. Hardline socialists were disappointed, as the nationalised industries seemed identical to the old private corporations, and national planning was made virtually impossible by the government's financial constraints. Socialism was in place, but it did not seem to make a major difference. Rank-and-file workers had long been motivated to support Labour by tales of the mistreatment of workers by foremen and the management. The foremen and the managers were the same people as before, with much the same power over the workplace. There was no worker control of industry. The unions resisted government efforts to set wages. By the time of the general elections in 1950 and 1951, Labour seldom boasted about nationalisation of industry. Instead it was the Conservatives who decried the inefficiency and mismanagement, and promised to reverse the takeover of steel and trucking.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Prosperity of the postwar years===\nAs the country headed into the 1950s, rebuilding continued and a number of immigrants from the remaining [[British Empire]], mostly the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent, were invited to help the rebuilding effort. As the 1950s wore on, Britain lost its place as a [[superpower]] and could no longer maintain its large [[British Empire|Empire]]. This led to decolonisation, and a withdrawal from almost all of its colonies by 1970. Events such as the [[Suez Crisis]] showed that the UK's status had fallen in the world. The 1950s and 1960s were, however, relatively prosperous times after the Second World War, and saw the beginning of a modernisation of the UK, with the construction of its first [[motorways]] for example, and also during the 1960s a great cultural movement began which expanded across the world. Unemployment was relatively low during this period and the standard of living continued to rise with more new private and council housing developments taking place and the number of slum properties diminishing.\n\nThe postwar period also witnessed a dramatic rise in the average standard of living,<ref>A companion to contemporary Britain, 1939\u20132000 by Paul Addison and Harriet Jones</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=skdI0R6pApcC&pg=PT60&dq=dominic+sandbrook+housing+conditions#v=onepage&q=dominic%20sandbrook%20housing%20conditions&f=false |title=State of Emergency: The Way We Were: Britain, 1970\u20131974 |first=Dominic |last=Sandbrook |publisher=Penguin Books Limited, 2011 |date=26 May 2011 |isbn=9780241956915}}</ref> as characterised by a 40% rise in average real wages from 1950 to 1965.<ref>Colin Sparks and John Tulloch, Eds., ''Tabloid tales: global debates over media standards''</ref> Earnings for men in industry rose by 95% between 1951 and 1964, while during that same period the official workweek was reduced and five reductions in income tax were made.<ref>http://www.brunel.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/111284/Dave-Ellis,-Swinging-Realism-The-Strange-Case-of-To-Sir,-With-Love-and-Up-the-Junction.pdf</ref> Those in traditionally poorly paid semi-skilled and unskilled occupations saw a particularly marked improvement in their wages and living standards.

[[Nationalism]] strengthened in other parts of the empire, particularly in India and in [[Egypt]].\n\nBetween 1867 and 1910, the UK had granted Australia, Canada, and New Zealand \"Dominion\" status (near complete autonomy within the Empire). They became charter members of the British Commonwealth of Nations (known as the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] since 1949), an informal but close-knit association that succeeded the British Empire. Beginning with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the remainder of the British Empire was almost completely dismantled. Today, most of Britain's former colonies belong to the Commonwealth, almost all of them as independent members.

British leaders feared their withdrawal would give a \"Doomsday Scenario\", with widespread communal strife, followed by the mass exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees. London shut down Northern Ireland's parliament and began direct rule. By the 1990s, the failure of the IRA campaign to win mass public support or achieve its aim of a British withdrawal led to negotiations that in 1998 produced the '[[Good Friday Agreement]]'.

The Conservatives were [[1970 United Kingdom general election|restored to government]] in 1970 under [[Edward Heath]], who failed to halt the country's economic decline and was ousted in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|1974]] as Labour returned to power under Harold Wilson.

This was also the time that the IRA took the issue of [[Northern Ireland]] to Great Britain, maintaining a prolonged bombing campaign on the British mainland.\n\nAfter the economic boom of the 1980s a brief but severe recession occurred between 1990 and 1992 following the economic chaos of [[Black Wednesday]] under government of [[John Major]], who had succeeded Margaret Thatcher in 1990. However the rest of the 1990s saw the beginning of a period of continuous economic growth that lasted over 16 years and was greatly expanded under the [[New Labour]] government of [[Tony Blair]] following his landslide election victory in 1997, with a rejuvenated party having abandoned its commitment to policies including nuclear disarmament and nationalisation of key industries, and no reversal of the Thatcher-led union reforms.\n\nFrom 1964 up until 1996, income per head had doubled, while ownership of various household goods had significantly increased. By 1996, two-thirds of households owned cars, 82% had central heating, most people owned a VCR, and one in five houses had a home computer.<ref>What Needs To Change: New Visions For Britain, edited by Giles Radice</ref> In 1971, 9% of households had no access to a shower or bathroom, compared with only 1% in 1990; largely due to demolition or modernisation of older properties which lacked such facilities. In 1971, only 35% had central heating, while 78% enjoyed this amenity in 1990. By 1990, 93% of households had colour television, 87% had telephones, 86% had washing machines, 80% had deep-freezers, 60% had video-recorders, and 47% had microwave ovens.

In opposition the Labour Party was deeply divided, though its Leader, Harold Wilson, remained in favour. In the 1974 General Election the Labour Party manifesto included a pledge to renegotiate terms for Britain's membership and then hold a referendum on whether to stay in the EC on the new terms. This was a constitutional procedure without precedent in British history. In the subsequent referendum campaign, rather than the normal British tradition of \"collective responsibility\", under which the government takes a policy position which all cabinet members are required to support publicly, members of the Government (and the Conservative opposition) were free to present their views on either side of the question.

The three UK-wide political parties\u2014Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats\u2014campaigned together as part of the [[Better Together (campaign)|Better Together]] campaign while the pro-independence Scottish National Party was the main force in the [[Yes Scotland]] campaign, together with the [[Scottish Green Party]] and the [[Scottish Socialist Party]]. Days before the vote, with the opinion polls closing, the three Better Together party leaders issued [[The Vow (devolution promise)|'The Vow']], a promise of more powers for Scotland in the event of a No vote. The referendum resulted in Scotland voting by 55% to 45% to remain part of the United Kingdom.\n\n===2015 election===\nThe [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 election]] was held on 7 May 2015 with pre-election polls all predicting a close race and a hung parliament. The surprising result on the night was a clear victory by the Conservative Party: with 37% of the popular vote, they won a narrow overall majority in parliament with 331 of the 650 seats.\n\nThe other most significant result of the election was the [[Scottish National Party]] winning all but three of the 59 seats in Scotland, a gain of 50. This had been widely forecast as opinion polls had recorded a surge in support for the SNP following the 2014 independence referendum, and SNP party membership had more than quadrupled from 25,000 to over 100,000, meaning that 1 in every 50 of the population of Scotland was a party member.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/scottish-politics/snp-boost-as-membership-soars-past-100k-mark.1427009904 |work=Glasgow Herald |title=SNP boost as membership soars past 100k mark |publisher=Newsquest |date=22 March 2015 |accessdate=22 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nLabour suffered its worst defeat since 1987, taking only 31% of the votes and losing 40 of its 41 seats in Scotland.

The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist [[Jacoby Shaddix]], guitarist [[Jerry Horton]], drummer Dave Buckner and bassist Will James.\n\nAfter two EPs, James left and was replaced by Tobin Esperance. The band independently released two more EPs before signing with DreamWorks Records in 1999. It released the triple-platinum ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]'' in 2000, the gold album ''[[Lovehatetragedy]]'' in 2002 and the platinum album ''[[Getting Away with Murder (album)|Getting Away with Murder]]'' in 2004. A year after ''[[The Paramour Sessions]]'', Buckner left in 2007, and was replaced by [[Tony Palermo]]. They then made ''[[Metamorphosis (Papa Roach album)|Metamorphosis]]'' (2009), ''[[Time for Annihilation]]'' (2010), ''[[The Connection (Papa Roach album)|The Connection]]'' (2012), ''[[F.E.A.R. (Papa Roach album)|F.E.A.R.]]'' (2015),  and ''[[Crooked Teeth (album)|Crooked Teeth]]'' (2017). The tenth studio album, ''[[Who Do You Trust? (album)|Who Do You Trust?]]'', was released on January 18, 2019.\n\nPapa Roach has sold more than 20 million album copies worldwide and are known for their songs \"[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]\", \"[[Between Angels and Insects]]\", \"[[She Loves Me Not (song)|She Loves Me Not]]\", \"[[Getting Away with Murder (song)|Getting Away with Murder]]\", \"[[Scars (Papa Roach song)|Scars]]\", \"[[Forever (Papa Roach song)|Forever]]\", \"[[Lifeline (Papa Roach song)|Lifeline]]\", and \"[[Face Everything and Rise (song)|Face Everything and Rise]]\".<!--, among others-->\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1993\u20131995)===\nPapa Roach's formation began in January 1993, when lead singer [[Jacoby Shaddix]] and drummer Dave Buckner met on the [[Vacaville High School]] football field. They were later joined by lead guitarist [[Jerry Horton]] from nearby [[Vanden High School]], trombonist Ben Luther and bassist Will James. They decided to enter the school's talent show, performing a version of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s song \"[[Fire (The Jimi Hendrix Experience song)|Fire]]\". They ultimately ended up losing the talent show. In March 1993, Ben Luther left the band. At this point, Papa Roach was practicing every day and touring, playing every gig they could get. Their first tour van was called Moby Dick, where Shaddix was inspired to come up with his first stage name \"Coby Dick\". The band chose the name Papa Roach from the nickname of Shaddix's step-grandfather, Howard William Roatch.<ref>{{cite magazine\n| date       = December 2000\n| title      = No Way Home\n| url        = https://books.google.com/books?id=aPe2ZKjsEBIC&lpg=PT33&dq=vol%2016%20%200886-3032&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q=roatch&f=false\n| magazine   = Spin Magazine\n}}</ref>\nIn 1994, Papa Roach released their first [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[Potatoes for Christmas]]''. Drummer Dave Buckner was temporarily replaced by Ryan Brown, as Buckner was spending the year in [[Seattle]] studying art. In 1995, they released a demo at Sound Farm Studios titled ''Caca Bonita''. By this time Buckner was back. In 1996, they replaced original bassist Will James with longtime roadie Tobin Esperance, as James' involvement in a church summer camp would limit the band's summer practicing and touring.\n\n===''Old Friends from Young Years'' and record deal (1996\u20131999)===\n{{Main|Old Friends from Young Years}}\n[[file:Papa Roach - Rock am Ring 2015-9782.jpg|thumb|Lead singer [[Jacoby Shaddix]].]]\nOn February 4, 1997, the band produced their debut studio album, entitled ''[[Old Friends from Young Years]]''. Still touring heavily, they supported bands such as [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Powerman 5000]], [[Hed PE]], [[Snot (band)|Snot]], [[Far (band)|Far]], and [[Static-X]].\n\nIn 1998, they released an EP titled ''[[5 Tracks Deep]]''.

The album continued in an alternative rock-based direction but still contained softer ballads akin to ''Getting Away with Murder''. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;16 on the Billboard 200 Charts.\n\nThe band started touring in support of the album in August 2006, with an American tour followed by another in Europe. In October 2006, Papa Roach toured with bands such as [[Guns N' Roses]], during their [[Chinese Democracy tour]], and [[Deftones]] throughout the United States, having major success.

The original lineup consisted of lead vocalist [[Jacoby Shaddix]], guitarist [[Jerry Horton]], drummer Dave Buckner and bassist Will James.\n\nAfter two EPs, James left and was replaced by Tobin Esperance. The band independently released two more EPs before signing with DreamWorks Records in 1999. It released the triple-platinum ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]'' in 2000, the gold album ''[[Lovehatetragedy]]'' in 2002 and the platinum album ''[[Getting Away with Murder (album)|Getting Away with Murder]]'' in 2004. A year after ''[[The Paramour Sessions]]'', Buckner left in 2007, and was replaced by [[Tony Palermo]]. They then made ''[[Metamorphosis (Papa Roach album)|Metamorphosis]]'' (2009), ''[[Time for Annihilation]]'' (2010), ''[[The Connection (Papa Roach album)|The Connection]]'' (2012), ''[[F.E.A.R. (Papa Roach album)|F.E.A.R.]]'' (2015),  and ''[[Crooked Teeth (album)|Crooked Teeth]]'' (2017). The tenth studio album, ''[[Who Do You Trust? (album)|Who Do You Trust?]]'', was released on January 18, 2019.\n\nPapa Roach has sold more than 20 million album copies worldwide and are known for their songs \"[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]\", \"[[Between Angels and Insects]]\", \"[[She Loves Me Not (song)|She Loves Me Not]]\", \"[[Getting Away with Murder (song)|Getting Away with Murder]]\", \"[[Scars (Papa Roach song)|Scars]]\", \"[[Forever (Papa Roach song)|Forever]]\", \"[[Lifeline (Papa Roach song)|Lifeline]]\", and \"[[Face Everything and Rise (song)|Face Everything and Rise]]\".<!--, among others-->\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1993\u20131995)===\nPapa Roach's formation began in January 1993, when lead singer [[Jacoby Shaddix]] and drummer Dave Buckner met on the [[Vacaville High School]] football field. They were later joined by lead guitarist [[Jerry Horton]] from nearby [[Vanden High School]], trombonist Ben Luther and bassist Will James. They decided to enter the school's talent show, performing a version of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s song \"[[Fire (The Jimi Hendrix Experience song)|Fire]]\". They ultimately ended up losing the talent show. In March 1993, Ben Luther left the band. At this point, Papa Roach was practicing every day and touring, playing every gig they could get. Their first tour van was called Moby Dick, where Shaddix was inspired to come up with his first stage name \"Coby Dick\". The band chose the name Papa Roach from the nickname of Shaddix's step-grandfather, Howard William Roatch.<ref>{{cite magazine\n| date       = December 2000\n| title      = No Way Home\n| url        = https://books.google.com/books?id=aPe2ZKjsEBIC&lpg=PT33&dq=vol%2016%20%200886-3032&pg=PA126#v=onepage&q=roatch&f=false\n| magazine   = Spin Magazine\n}}</ref>\nIn 1994, Papa Roach released their first [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[Potatoes for Christmas]]''. Drummer Dave Buckner was temporarily replaced by Ryan Brown, as Buckner was spending the year in [[Seattle]] studying art. In 1995, they released a demo at Sound Farm Studios titled ''Caca Bonita''. By this time Buckner was back. In 1996, they replaced original bassist Will James with longtime roadie Tobin Esperance, as James' involvement in a church summer camp would limit the band's summer practicing and touring.\n\n===''Old Friends from Young Years'' and record deal (1996\u20131999)===\n{{Main|Old Friends from Young Years}}\n[[file:Papa Roach - Rock am Ring 2015-9782.jpg|thumb|Lead singer [[Jacoby Shaddix]].]]\nOn February 4, 1997, the band produced their debut studio album, entitled ''[[Old Friends from Young Years]]''. Still touring heavily, they supported bands such as [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Powerman 5000]], [[Hed PE]], [[Snot (band)|Snot]], [[Far (band)|Far]], and [[Static-X]].\n\nIn 1998, they released an EP titled ''[[5 Tracks Deep]]''. It sold more than 1,000 copies in its first month of release. In 1999, they produced another EP, which would end up being their last independent release, titled ''[[Let 'Em Know]]''. Its success caught the attention of [[Warner Music Group]], who as part of a development deal provided a small amount of money for the production of a five-track promo-demo CD.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">[http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Jay_Baumgardner_Interview.html \"Interview With Jay Baumgardner\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017122140/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Jay_Baumgardner_Interview.html |date=2012-10-17 }}, ''[[HitQuarters]]'', 25 Apr 2005.</ref> The band decided they wanted influential rock producer [[Jay Baumgardner]] on board to produce the record.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> In an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Baumgardner said, \u201cAt first I wasn\u2019t really convinced it would work out, but then I saw a video of them performing at a club - I saw all these kids going wild, knowing the songs by heart - and that\u2019s when I realized that they definitely had potential.\u201d<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/>\n\nWarner Bros. was not impressed with the demo, and elected not to sign them.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\"/> The unreleased disc included the songs \"Infest\", \"[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]\", \"[[Broken Home (Papa Roach song)|Broken Home]]\", \"Dead Cell\", and \"[[She Loves Me Not (song)|She Loves Me Not]]\".\n\nSoon after, [[DreamWorks Records]] offered the band a recording contract.\n\n===Mainstream success, ''Infest, Lovehatetragedy'' and ''Getting Away With Murder'' (2000\u20132005)===\n[[file:Papa Roach 2006.jpg|thumb|The band in 2006. from left to right: Dave Buckner, Tobin Esperance, Jacoby Shaddix, Jerry Horton]]\nAfter signing with DreamWorks Records in October 1999, they immediately entered the studio to record their major-label debut  album titled ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.27.00/edge-0017.html|title=Metroactive Music - The Edge|website=www.metroactive.com|accessdate=10 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725232838/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/04.27.00/edge-0017.html|archivedate=25 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://76.12.46.30/interviews/2000/paparoach.htm|title=Interview with Tobin Esperance of Papa Roach (NY Rock)|website=76.12.46.30|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref> The album included old songs from their independent releases, these being \"Infest\", \"[[Last Resort (song)|Last Resort]]\", \"[[Broken Home (Papa Roach song)|Broken Home]]\", \"Dead Cell\" from the Warner Bros. demo CD; \"Revenge In Japanese\" as \"Revenge\" and \"Thrown Away\" from their ''5 Tracks Deep'' EP; \"Legacy\", \"Binge\", \"Snakes\", and a softer version of the originally heavier \"Tightrope\" from the ''[[Let 'Em Know]]'' EP; which were re-recorded, and three additional newly written songs: \"[[Between Angels and Insects|Obsession]]\" (later known as \"Between Angels and Insects\"), \"Blood Brothers\", and \"Never Enough\".

The album continued in an alternative rock-based direction but still contained softer ballads akin to ''Getting Away with Murder''. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;16 on the Billboard 200 Charts.\n\nThe band started touring in support of the album in August 2006, with an American tour followed by another in Europe.

She assisted her brother [[Tycho Brahe]] with his astronomical observations.\n\n==Life==\nShe was born in [[Knutstorp Castle|Knudstrup]], [[Knutstorp Castle|Sweden]] as the youngest of ten children, to [[Otte Brahe]], the ''rigsr\u00e5d,'' or advisor, to the King of Denmark; and [[Beate Bille Brahe]], leader of the royal household for [[Sophie of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow|Queen Sophie]]. Sophia's oldest brother was astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]]. Though he was both more than a decade her senior and raised in a separate household, the pair became quite close by the time Sophia was a teenager.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Tycho Brahe, a picture of scientific life and work in the sixteenth century|last=Dreyer|first=J.L.E.|publisher=A. & C.

She had one child with him before he died on 23 March 1588.<ref>{{harvnb|Christianson|2000|p=161}}</ref><ref name=\"Christianson2000\">{{harvnb|Christianson|2000|p=259}}</ref> Their son was {{ill|Tage Thott|da|Tage_Ottesen_Thott_til_Eriksholm}}, born in 1580. Upon her husband's death, Sophie Thott managed his property in Eriksholm (today [[Trolleholm Castle]]<ref name=\":2\">{{harvnb|Christianson|2000|p=258}}.</ref>), running the estate to keep it profitable until her son came of age. During this time, she also became a horticulturalist, in addition to her studies in chemistry and medicine. The gardens she created in Eriksholm were said to be exceptional.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sophie was particularly interested in studying chemistry and medicine according to [[Paracelsus]],<ref name=\"Christianson2000\" /> in which small doses of poison might serve as strong medicines, and used her skills to treat the local poor.<ref name=\":0\" /> She was devoted to the study of astrology and helped her brother with producing horoscopes.\n\nOn 21 July 1587, King Frederick II of Denmark signed a document transferring to Sophia Brahe title of [[\u00c5rup]] farm in what is now [[Sweden]] (Svensson, et al.).\n\nSophia continued to be a frequent visitor at Uranienborg where she met Erik Lange, a nobleman who studied alchemy and a friend of Tycho's.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1590, Sophie took 13 visits to Uranienborg and became engaged to Lange. Lange used up most of his fortune with alchemy experiments, so their marriage was delayed some years while he avoided his creditors and traveled to Germany to try to find patrons for his work. Tycho Brahe wrote the Latin epic poem \"[[Urania Titani]]\" during the couple's separation, expressed as a letter from his sister Sophia to her fianc\u00e9 in 1594.<ref name=\"Christianson2000\"/> Tycho casts Sophia as Urania, muse of astronomy,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ziggelaar|first=August|date=September 1996|title=Reviewed Work: Tycho Brahes \"Urania Titani\": Et digt om Sophie Brahe by Peter Zeeberg|url=|journal=Isis|volume= 87| issue =  3|pages=542\u2013543|doi=10.1086/357600}}</ref> a further suggestion of his respect for her scientific endeavours.\n\nIn 1599, she visited Lange in Hamburg, but they did not marry until 1602 in [[Eckernf\u00f6rde]]. They lived in this town for a while in extreme poverty. Sophie wrote a long letter to her sister Margrethe Brahe, describing having to wear stockings with holes in them for her wedding. Lange's wedding clothes had to be returned to the pawn shop after the wedding, because the couple could not afford to keep them. She expressed anger with her family for not accepting her science studies, and for depriving her of money owed to her. By 1608, Erik Lange was living in [[Prague]], and he died there in 1613 (Det Kongelige Bibliotek).\n\nSophia was often ridiculed and avoided due to her personal life and marriage. Many alienated her due to her marriage to Erik Lange which was opposed by all in her family except for her brother Tycho. <ref name=\"Christianson2000a2\" />\n\nSophie Brahe personally financed the restoration of the local church, [[Ivetofta|Ivetofta kyrka]]. She planned to be buried there, and the lid for her unused sarcophagus remains in the church's armory (Svensson, et al.). But, by 1616 she had moved permanently to [[Zealand]] and settled in [[Helsing\u00f8r]]. In [[Zealand]], she lived specifically in Elsinore where she worked primarily on horticulture and healing plants.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Copenhagen |last2=Gothenburg |title=Sophia Ottesdatter Brahe |url=https://nordicwomensliterature.net/writers/brahe-sophie-ottesdatter/ |website=The History of Nordic Women's Literature |publisher=KvindeLitteraturHistorie P\u00c5 Nettet, 2012. |accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref> She spent her last years writing up the genealogy of Danish noble families, publishing the first major version in 1626 (there were later additions). Her work is still considered a major source for early history of Danish nobility (Det Kongelige Bibliotek). She died in [[Helsing\u00f8r]] in the year 1643,<ref name=\"Christianson2000a2\">{{harvnb|Christianson|2000|p=264}}</ref> and was buried in the Torrl\u00f6sa old church in the village of Torrl\u00f6sa, east of the town of [[Landskrona]] in what was then Denmark but now is southern Sweden. That church housed a burial chapel for the Thott family that remained for some time even after the church itself was pulled down in the mid-19th century (the new Torrl\u00f6sa church was built nearby). Currently, a stone setting marks the outlines of the Thott chapel, while the tombstone for Sophie Brahe is still standing on the site.\n\n== Career and Research ==\nTycho wrote that he had trained Sophia in horticulture and chemistry, but he initially discouraged her from studying astronomy. Instead, Sophia learned astronomy on her own, studying books in German, and having Latin books translated with her own money so that she could read them as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asmu.dk/pub/Download/nyhedsbrev/1.aar/sophie303.pdf|title=Hvem er Sophie|last=Tjornum|first=Gilbert|date=November 11, 2003|website=Astrologisk Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> <ref>{{harvnb|Christianson|2000|p=57}}: 8 December 1573 ... helped Tycho to observe a lunar eclipse</ref> Later in both of their careers, Tycho began to discourage her from continuing her research into astronomy because he believed it to be too complex for the talents of a woman.<ref name=\"Christianson2000\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSophia frequently visited [[Uraniborg|Uranienborg]], Tycho's observatory on the then-Danish island of [[Ven, Sweden|Hveen]].<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=Dreyer|first=J.L.E.|title=Tycho Brahe, a picture of scientific life and work in the sixteenth century|publisher=A. & C.

Specifically, she assisted with a set of observations on 11 November 1572, which led to the discovery of the supernova that is now called [[SN 1572]], as well as observations of the [[December 1573 lunar eclipse|8 December 1573 lunar eclipse]]. The discovery of SN 1572 was especially significant in that it added to the growing body of evidence that seemed to refute the [[geocentric model]] of the universe. Sophia's assistance was also instrumental in Tycho's work on orbits, which was foundational to the modern methods used to predict the positions of the planets. Tycho's studies of orbits involved the most precise measurements of the planets' movements made prior to the invention of the telescope, and while Tycho created many of the astronomical devices used to conduct the measurements, Sophia was among the assistants who actually made the measurements.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web|url=https://www.schoolsobservatory.org/learn/careers/astronomy/astrowomen/Brahe|title=Sophia Brahe (1556 - 1643)|website=National Schools' Observatory|publisher=Liverpool John Moores University|accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref>  Tycho did have other assistants, however, and while Sophia was present for each of these discoveries, the extent to which she contributed personally is unknown.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Dreyer|first=J.L.E.|title=Tycho Brahe, a picture of scientific life and work in the sixteenth century|publisher=A. & C.

This really shines true during her marriage. Sophia remarries in 1602 to the alchemist Erik Lange. Lange, like many alchemists was striving to change different metal into gold. In the pursuit of this goal Lange, with the support of his wife, spent all of the money that the two had saved. They lived in extreme poverty until Erik Lange passed away.

She assisted her brother [[Tycho Brahe]] with his astronomical observations.\n\n==Life==\nShe was born in [[Knutstorp Castle|In Sweden Knudstrup]], as the youngest of ten children, to [[Otte Brahe]] ''rigsr\u00e5d,'' or advisor to the King of Denmark; and [[Beate Bille Brahe]], leader of the royal household for [[Sophie of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow|Queen Sophie]]. Sophia's oldest brother was astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]]. Though he was both more than a decade her senior and raised in a separate household, the pair became quite close by the time Sophia was a teenager.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Tycho Brahe, a picture of scientific life and work in the sixteenth century|last=Dreyer|first=J.L.E.|publisher=A. & C.

Upon her husband's death, Sophie Thott managed his property in Eriksholm (today [[Trolleholm Castle]]<ref name=\":2\">{{harvnb|Christianson|2000|p=258}}.</ref>), running the estate to keep it profitable until her son came of age. During this time, she also became a horticulturalist, in addition to her studies in chemistry and medicine. The gardens she created in Eriksholm were said to be exceptional.<ref name=\":0\" /> Sophie was particularly interested in studying chemistry and medicine according to [[Paracelsus]],<ref name=\"Christianson2000\" /> in which small doses of poison might serve as strong medicines, and used her skills to treat the local poor.<ref name=\":0\" /> She was devoted to the study of astrology and helped her brother with producing horoscopes.\n\nOn 21 July 1587, King Frederick II of Denmark signed a document transferring to Sophia Brahe title of [[\u00c5rup]] farm in what is now [[Sweden]] (Svensson, et al.).\n\nSophia continued to be a frequent visitor at Uranienborg where she met Erik Lange, a nobleman who studied alchemy and a friend of Tycho's.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1590, Sophie took 13 visits to Uranienborg and became engaged to Lange. Lange used up most of his fortune with alchemy experiments, so their marriage was delayed some years while he avoided his creditors and traveled to Germany to try to find patrons for his work. Tycho Brahe wrote the Latin epic poem \"[[Urania Titani]]\" during the couple's separation, expressed as a letter from his sister Sophia to her fianc\u00e9 in 1594.<ref name=\"Christianson2000\"/> Tycho casts Sophia as Urania, muse of astronomy,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ziggelaar|first=August|date=September 1996|title=Reviewed Work: Tycho Brahes \"Urania Titani\": Et digt om Sophie Brahe by Peter Zeeberg|url=|journal=Isis|volume= 87| issue =  3|pages=542\u2013543|doi=10.1086/357600}}</ref> a further suggestion of his respect for her scientific endeavours.\n\nIn 1599, she visited Lange in Hamburg, but they did not marry until 1602 in [[Eckernf\u00f6rde]]. They lived in this town for a while in extreme poverty. Sophie wrote a long letter to her sister Margrethe Brahe, describing having to wear stockings with holes in them for her wedding. Lange's wedding clothes had to be returned to the pawn shop after the wedding, because the couple could not afford to keep them. She expressed anger with her family for not accepting her science studies, and for depriving her of money owed to her. By 1608, Erik Lange was living in [[Prague]], and he died there in 1613 (Det Kongelige Bibliotek).\n\nSophia was often ridiculed and avoided due to her personal life and marriage. Many alienated her due to her marriage to Erik Lange which was opposed by all in her family except for her brother Tycho. <ref name=\"Christianson2000a2\" />\n\nSophie Brahe personally financed the restoration of the local church, [[Ivetofta|Ivetofta kyrka]]. She planned to be buried there, and the lid for her unused sarcophagus remains in the church's armory (Svensson, et al.). But, by 1616 she had moved permanently to [[Zealand]] and settled in [[Helsing\u00f8r]]. In [[Zealand]], she lived specifically in Elsinore where she worked primarily on horticulture and healing plants.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Copenhagen |last2=Gothenburg |title=Sophia Ottesdatter Brahe |url=https://nordicwomensliterature.net/writers/brahe-sophie-ottesdatter/ |website=The History of Nordic Women's Literature |publisher=KvindeLitteraturHistorie P\u00c5 Nettet, 2012. |accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref> She spent her last years writing up the genealogy of Danish noble families, publishing the first major version in 1626 (there were later additions). Her work is still considered a major source for early history of Danish nobility (Det Kongelige Bibliotek). She died in [[Helsing\u00f8r]] in the year 1643,<ref name=\"Christianson2000a2\">{{harvnb|Christianson|2000|p=264}}</ref> and was buried in the Torrl\u00f6sa old church in the village of Torrl\u00f6sa, east of the town of [[Landskrona]] in what was then Denmark but now is southern Sweden. That church housed a burial chapel for the Thott family that remained for some time even after the church itself was pulled down in the mid-19th century (the new Torrl\u00f6sa church was built nearby). Currently, a stone setting marks the outlines of the Thott chapel, while the tombstone for Sophie Brahe is still standing on the site.\n\n== Career and Research ==\nTycho wrote that he had trained Sophia in horticulture and chemistry, but he initially discouraged her from studying astronomy. Instead, Sophia learned astronomy on her own, studying books in German, and having Latin books translated with her own money so that she could read them as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://asmu.dk/pub/Download/nyhedsbrev/1.aar/sophie303.pdf|title=Hvem er Sophie|last=Tjornum|first=Gilbert|date=November 11, 2003|website=Astrologisk Museum|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> <ref>{{harvnb|Christianson|2000|p=57}}: 8 December 1573 ... helped Tycho to observe a lunar eclipse</ref> Later in both of their careers, Tycho began to discourage her from continuing her research into astronomy because he believed it to be too complex for the talents of a woman.<ref name=\"Christianson2000\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSophia frequently visited [[Uraniborg|Uranienborg]], Tycho's observatory on the then-Danish island of [[Ven, Sweden|Hveen]].<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|last=Dreyer|first=J.L.E.|title=Tycho Brahe, a picture of scientific life and work in the sixteenth century|publisher=A. & C.

Specifically, she assisted with a set of observations on 11 November 1572, which led to the discovery of the supernova that is now called [[SN 1572]], as well as observations of the [[December 1573 lunar eclipse|8 December 1573 lunar eclipse]]. The discovery of SN 1572 was especially significant in that it added to the growing body of evidence that seemed to refute the [[geocentric model]] of the universe. Sophia's assistance was also instrumental in Tycho's work on orbits, which was foundational to the modern methods used to predict the positions of the planets. Tycho's studies of orbits involved the most precise measurements of the planets' movements made prior to the invention of the telescope, and while Tycho created many of the astronomical devices used to conduct the measurements, Sophia was among the assistants who actually made the measurements.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite web|url=https://www.schoolsobservatory.org/learn/careers/astronomy/astrowomen/Brahe|title=Sophia Brahe (1556 - 1643)|website=National Schools' Observatory|publisher=Liverpool John Moores University|accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref>  Tycho did have other assistants, however, and while Sophia was present for each of these discoveries, the extent to which she contributed personally is unknown.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Dreyer|first=J.L.E.|title=Tycho Brahe, a picture of scientific life and work in the sixteenth century|publisher=A. & C.

This really shines true during her marriage. Sophia remarries in 1602 to the alchemist Erik Lange. Lange, like many alchemists was striving to change different metal into gold. In the pursuit of this goal Lange, with the support of his wife, spent all of the money that the two had saved. They lived in extreme poverty until Erik Lange passed away.
