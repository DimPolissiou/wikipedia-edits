Scarborough became the capital of Tobago in 1769. Situated in western Tobago, Scarborough is the economic and cultural centre of the island of Tobago. The estimated population in 2011 was 17,537. Scarborough is ranked as one of Trinidad and Tobago's most densely populated towns alongside [[Port of Spain]], [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]], [[Chaguanas]] and [[Arima]]. The city's skyline is dominated by Fort King George, an 18th-century fortification named after King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], which now hosts a historic and archaeologic museum. Scarborough's deepwater harbour was built in 1991; before that ships were forced to anchor offshore.\n\n==Facilities==\nShaw Park Cultural Complex is the largest performing arts theatre in the [[Caribbean]]. The facility has a capacity in its main hall of over 5000 as well as a conference and lecture halls.\nThe city has a library completed in 2012, and Scarborough General Hospital was completed in 2014.\n\n==Suburbs ==\n* Bacolet\n* Bethel\n* Carnbee\n* Lambeau\n* Signal Hill\n* Orange Hill\n* Patience Hill\n* Providence \n* Roselle\n* Mount Saint George\n* Lowlands\n* Calder Hal\n\n==History==\nScarborough became the capital of Tobago in 1769 when it replaced the then-capital of Georgetown.

The film's title was taken from [[George Eliot]]'s book ''[[Middlemarch]]''.\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2019 and was theatrically released in the United States on December 13, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/18/cannes-festival-2019-full-list-of-films|title=Cannes festival 2019: full list of films|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=18 April 2019}}</ref> It was the final film to be released under the Fox Searchlight Pictures name before [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] changed the company's name to Searchlight Pictures on January 17, 2020.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Austria]], 1939. Peasant farmer [[Franz J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter]] ([[August Diehl]]), born and bred in the small village of [[Sankt Radegund|St. Radegund]], is working his land when war breaks out. Married to Franziska (Fani) ([[Valerie Pachner]]), the couple are important members of the tight-knit rural community. They live a simple life with the passing years marked by the arrival of the couple's three girls. Franz is called up to basic training and is away from his beloved wife and children for months. Eventually, when [[Fall of France|France surrenders]] and it seems the war might end soon, he is sent back from training. With his mother and sister-in-law Resie ([[Maria Simon]]), he and his wife farm the land and raise their children amid the mountains and valleys of upper Austria. Many scenes depict cutting and gathering hay, as well as the broad [[Inn River]]. As the war goes on, J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter and the other able-bodied men in the village are called up to fight. Their first requirement is to swear an [[Hitler oath|oath of allegiance]] to [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Third Reich]]. Despite pressure from the Mayor and his farm neighbors, who increasingly ostracize him and his family, and from the Bishop of Salzburg, J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter refuses. Wrestling with the knowledge that his decision will mean arrest and even death, J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter finds strength in Fani's love and support. J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter is taken to prison, first in [[Enns (town)|Enns]], then in [[Berlin]] and waits months for his trial. During his time in prison, he and Fani write letters to one another and give each other strength.

Peasant farmer [[Franz J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter]] ([[August Diehl]]), born and bred in the small village of [[Sankt Radegund|St. Radegund]], is working his land when war breaks out. Married to Franziska (Fani) ([[Valerie Pachner]]), the couple are important members of the tight-knit rural community. They live a simple life with the passing years marked by the arrival of the couple's three girls. Franz is called up to basic training and is away from his beloved wife and children for months. Eventually, when [[Fall of France|France surrenders]] and it seems the war might end soon, he is sent back from training. With his mother and sister-in-law Resie ([[Maria Simon]]), he and his wife farm the land and raise their children amid the mountains and valleys of upper Austria. Many scenes depict cutting and gathering hay, as well as the broad [[Inn River]]. As the war goes on, J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter and the other able-bodied men in the village are called up to fight. Their first requirement is to swear an [[Hitler oath|oath of allegiance]] to [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Third Reich]]. Despite pressure from the Mayor and his farm neighbors, who increasingly ostracize him and his family, and from the Bishop of Salzburg, J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter refuses. Wrestling with the knowledge that his decision will mean arrest and even death, J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter finds strength in Fani's love and support. J\u00e4gerst\u00e4tter is taken to prison, first in [[Enns (town)|Enns]], then in [[Berlin]] and waits months for his trial. During his time in prison, he and Fani write letters to one another and give each other strength. Fani and their daughters are victims of growing hostility in the village over her husband's decision not to fight. Fani is eventually able to visit her husband in Berlin.\n\nAfter months of brutal incarceration, his case goes to trial. He is found guilty and sentenced to death.

Its name originates from the fishing vocabulary; in the [[Middle Ages]] it referred to the right to ''pull up'' fishing nets and hence to the right to fish.\n\nThe municipality had a total population of {{Swiss populations|CH-ZG|1711}} in {{Swiss populations date|CH-ZG}}.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-ZG}} The official language of Zug is the Swiss variety of Standard [[Swiss Standard German|German]], but the main spoken language is the local variant of the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] [[Swiss German (linguistics)|Swiss German]] dialect.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Stumpf-Chronik-Zug.png|thumb|View of Zug before 1547]]\n[[File:Zug - Unterstadt - Zugersee IMG 2606.JPG|thumb|''Unterstadt'' (lower town) as seen from [[Lake Zug]] harbour]]\n[[File:Zug - Oberstadt IMG 2611.jpg|thumb|''Oberstadt'' (upper town) in the [[Altstadt]]]]\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area trace back to 14,000 BC. There have been Paleolithic finds on the north bank of Lake Zug, which come from nomadic hunters and gatherers. Archaeologists have also found over forty lake-shore settlements, known as [[pile dwellings]], on the shores of Lake Zug from the epoch of the first settled farmers in the [[Neolithic]] period (5,500-2,200 BC). The peak in these lake-shore village settlements was between 3800 and 2450 BC. For the same epoch, the first pre-alpine land use has been found in Menzingen and in the \u00c4geri valley. The well-known, historically-researched lake-shore village '' 'Sumpf' '' (the swamp), dated from the late Bronze Age (up until 850 BC). Evidence from these finds resulted in a quite different picture of life in former times, which is on display at the Zug Museum for Prehistory. In addition, finds from the Iron Age (850-50 BC) and the Roman and Celtic-Roman time (from 50 BC) have been unearthed.\n\n===Kyburg foundation===\nIn around AD 600, Alemannic families and tribes immigrated to the area of present-day canton Zug. The name Blickensdorf, and place names with \u2018- ikon\u2019 endings, prove this as the first Alemannic living space{{why|date=March 2018}}. The churches of Baar and Risch also date back to the early Middle Ages. \nThe first written document on the area originates from the year 858, and refers to King [[Ludwig the German]] giving the farm ''Chama'' (Cham) to the Z\u00fcrich Fraum\u00fcnster convent. At this time, the area of present-day Zug belonged to completely different monastic and secular landlords, the most important of whom were the Habsburgs, and who, in 1264, inherited the Kyburg rights and remained a central political power until about 1400.\n\nIn the course of the high medieval town construction, the settlement of Zug also received a town wall at some point after 1200. The town founders were probably the counts of [[County of Kyburg|Kyburg]]. The town, first mentioned in AD 1240, was called an \"[[oppidum]]\" in 1242 and a \"[[castrum]]\" in 1255. In 1273, it was bought by [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]] from Anna, the heiress of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] and wife of Eberhard, head of the [[cadet branch|cadet line]] of [[Habsburg]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}  Through this purchase it passed into the control of the Habsburgs and was placed under a Habsburg [[bailiff]]. The ''Aeusser Amt'' or Outer District consisted of the villages and towns surrounding Zug, which each had their own ''[[Landsgemeinde]]n'' but were ruled by a single Habsburg bailiff. Zug was important as an administrative center of the Kyburg and the [[Habsburg]] district, then as a local market place, and, thereafter, as a stage town for the transport of goods (particularly salt and iron) over the Hirzel hill towards Lucerne.\n\n===Joining the Swiss Confederation===\nOn 27 June 1352, both the town of Zug and the ''Aeusser Amt'' entered the [[Swiss Confederation]], the latter being received on exactly the same terms as the town, and not, as was usual in the case of outer districts, as a subject land. However, in September 1352 Zug had to acknowledge its own lords again, and in 1355 was obliged to break off its connection with the league. About 1364, the town and the Aeusser Amt were recovered for the league by the men of [[Schwyz]], and from this time Zug took part as a full member in all the acts of the league. In 1379, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Wenceslaus, Holy Roman Emperor|Wenceslaus]] exempted Zug from all external jurisdictions, and in 1389 the Habsburgs renounced their claims, reserving only an annual payment of 20 silver marks, which came to an end in 1415. In 1400 Wenceslaus gave all criminal jurisdiction to the town only. The Aeusser Amt, in 1404, then claimed that the banner and seal of Zug should be kept in one of the country districts and were supported in this claim by Schwyz. The matter was finally settled in 1412 by arbitration, and the banner was to be kept in the town. Finally in 1415, the right of electing their ''[[landammann]]'' was given to Zug by the Confederation, and a share in the criminal jurisdiction was granted to the Aeusser Amt by German king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe alliance of the four forest cantons of [[Uri (canton)|Uri]], [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]] and [[Lucerne]] with the city of Z\u00fcrich in 1351 set much in motion. The town of Zug was seen as having Habsburg ties with the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Lucerne, and therefore had to be conquered. It is likely that this was more for political than economic reasons: the Lucerne market was very important for central Switzerland, but also strongly dependent on the city of [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Z\u00fcrich initiated a siege on Zug with the federal army in June 1352. Zug surrendered. On 27 June 1352 Z\u00fcrich, Luzern, Zug, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed an alliance. Z\u00fcrich's saw this \u2018Zugerbund\u2019 (Zug alliance) as an alliance of convenience. For the town of Zug, little changed, and Zug remained Habsburg. That same year, the Zug alliance was declared invalid by all parties. A period of Schwyz domination then followed. Only gradually did Zug become sovereign and federal.\n\nSimultaneously, Zug expanded its territory, acquiring a number of rural areas in the form of bailiwicks ([[Walchwil]], [[Cham (Switzerland)|Cham]], Gangolfswil [Risch] [[H\u00fcnenberg]] and [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]], and Oberr\u00fcti, now part of the canton of Aargau). Zug became a confederation in itself - with the town and its subject territories, and the three outer (\u2018free\u2019) municipalities, [[\u00c4geri]], [[Menzingen]] (with [[Neuheim]]) and [[Baar, Switzerland|Baar]]. This problematic dualism dominated until 1798, i.e. until the end of the old confederation, the political structure of the Canton Zug. The unifying element of this miniature confederation was, among others, the rural municipalities and the forty-member city council.\n\n===Growth of the town===\nIn 1385, Zug joined the league of the Swabian cities against [[Leopold III of Austria (Habsburg)|Leopold III of Austria]] and shared in the victory of [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]], as well as in the various [[Aargau|Argovian]] (1415) and [[Thurgau|Thurgovian]] (1460) conquests of the Confederates, and later in those of Italy (1512), having already taken part in the occupation of the Val d'Ossola. Between 1379 ([[Walchwil]]) and 1477 ([[Cham, Switzerland|Cham]]), Zug had acquired various districts in its own neighborhood, principally to the north and the west, which were ruled till 1798 by the town alone as subject lands.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nIn 1478, the building of a larger town wall began, which increased the town area six-fold - the same year as the building of the late gothic St. Oswald Church began. The building master of the new town wall was Hans Felder from Bavarian Swabia. The ground plan of the town wall is indicative of an ideal symmetric plan of the Renaissance period \u2013 something very rare at that time. The overall urban planning implemented in the small town of Zug was modern for its time.\n\n===The Reformation and Early Modern Era===\nDuring the turmoil of the Reformation, Zug remained on the Catholic side of central Switzerland and retained the old faith. Warring religious confederates fought at Kappel am Albis (1531) and at Gubel in Menzingen. Its location on the edge of central Switzerland made Zug a confessional border town. During the Reformation, Zug clung to the old faith and was a member of the ''Christliche Vereinigung'' of 1529. In 1586, it became a member of the Golden League.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe period up until 1798 was marked by internal political rivalries and turbulence. The invasion of the French troops marked the end of the old order, and with the Helvetic order came a radical political change. Zug became part of the canton Waldst\u00e4tten, and the cantonal capital for a short time. After a 50-year struggle between federalism and centralism, between confederation and central state, between conservative and liberal-radical vision, in 1848, today's federal government of Switzerland emerged. Zug was given its current cantonal structure, consisting of eleven local municipalities.\n\n===Industrialization and internationalization===\nUntil well into the 19th century, Zug consisted of agricultural land. Actual industrialization began with the entrepreneur Wolfgang Henggeler, who in 1834 built a cotton mill in Unter\u00e4geri. This was followed by the two companies in Neu\u00e4geri and Baar.\nIn 1866, the American George Ham Page founded the first European condensed milk factory in Cham, which later merged with [[Nestl\u00e9]]. Industry in Zug was dominated by the company [[Landis+Gyr]], founded in 1896, and now owned by [[Toshiba]]. The connection to the Swiss railway network in 1864 was important, as was the connection of mountain and valley with an electric tram at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIn the second half of the century, dynamic expansion took place and Zug became a national and international financial and trading center, aided by its proximity to Z\u00fcrich, and by an attractive tax policy. In parallel, large industrial and commercial zones evolved; employment increased rapidly; the population rose sharply, and the building boom skyrocketed. Canton Zug catapulted itself into being at the top of the financially strong cantons. And the town today has become, as the British Guardian once wrote, \u2018a compass of the global economy\u2019.\n\n===Today===\nZug is a [[tax haven|low tax region]], and is headquarters for a number of multinational enterprises. The town's best known agricultural product is [[Kirsch]].\n\nOn 27 September 2001, an angry, unstable gunman, [[Friedrich Leibacher]], shot and killed 15 people including himself in the cantonal parliament of Zug. The event became known as the [[Zug Massacre]].<ref name=bericht>[http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf Untersuchungsrichterlicher Schlu\u00dfbericht] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006042522/http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf |date=6 October 2011 }} (German)</ref>\n\n[[File:Sunset over Zug.jpg|thumb|center|750px|Night view of Zug and its [[Lake Zug|lake]]]]\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\n[[File:City of zug oldtown aerial view \u8001\u9547.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Zug]]\nZug has an area (as of the 2004 survey) of {{Swiss area|1711|mi=on}}.{{Swiss area data|1711|QUELLE}}  Of this area, about 33.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 37.9% is forested.

Towards its northerly end, a monument marks the spot where a part of the shore slipped into the lake in 1887.\n\nThe older part of the town is rather crowded together, though only four of the wall towers and a small part of the town walls still survive.\n\nThe most striking old building in the town is the parish church of St Oswald (late 15th century), dedicated to [[Oswald of Bernicia|St Oswald]], king of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] (d. 642), one of whose arms was brought to Zug in 1485. The town hall, also a 15th-century building, now houses the Historical and Antiquarian Museum. There are some quaint old painted houses close by. A little way higher up the hillside is a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] convent in a striking position, close to the town wall and leaning against it. Still higher, and outside the old town, is the fine new parish church of St Michael, consecrated in 1902.\n\nThe business quarter is on the rising ground north of the old town, near the railway station. Several fine modern buildings rise on or close to the shore in the town and to its south, whilst to the southwest is a convent of Capuchin nuns, who manage a large girls' school and several other educational establishments.\n\nThe ''Museum of Prehistory Zug'' houses an important collection of archaeological remains, especially from the late [[Bronze Age]] ([[urnfield culture]]) settlement of [[Zug-Sumpf]]. Many of [[Catharine II of Russia]]'s relatives descended from Zug and became known as the [[Volga German]]s.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are three museums in the town: the Museum of Prehistory, which displays archaeological finds from Canton Zug; the castle houses the Museum of Cultural History of the town and Canton Zug, and the Zug Art Gallery attracts visitors with its exhibitions.<ref>[http://www.museenzug.ch Museums of Zug]</ref>\nSeveral municipalities also have their own local museum. The Casino Theatre in Zug and the Zug ''Burgbachkeller'', along with the ''Chollerhalle'' cultural center, are the most famous establishments. The event centers in Baar, Cham and Rotkreuz and the Zug youth scene (Galvanik, Podium Industrie 45) enrich the range of cultural events.\n\nZug is surrounded with mountains, rivers and lakes including the mountains Zugerberg and the Walchwilerberg Oberallmig, the H\u00f6hronen and the river Sihl. The Choller nature reserve is also near Lake Zug.\n\nSights within the town include the late Gothic church of St. Wolfgang, near H\u00fchnenberg, or St. Oswald in Zug, the old town of Zug with the Town Hall and the [[Zytturm, Zug|Zytturm]] (clock tower), the [[Huwiler Tower]], the Zurlaubenhof, feudal estate of the family Zurlauben, on the outskirts of the town.\n\nZug's culture also includes the famous Zuger cherry liqueur cake. Local specialties, in addition to the cherry and the cherry liqueur cake, include the Zug \u2018R\u00f6tel\u2019, a fine lake charfish, found on many menus.<ref>[http://www.zug-tourismus.ch/en/welcome.cfm Zug Tourism]</ref>\n\nThe [[IG Culture Zug society]] currently has some 200 members.\n\n===Heritage sites===\nThere are a number of Swiss [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage sites of national significance]] in Zug. These include two libraries, the Library of the former Capuchin monastery and the library of the [[parish church]] of St. Michael. One archeological site, the ''Sumpf'' a late Bronze Age lake shore settlement, is included, as are three museums; the ''Burg'' (Castle museum), ''Kunsthaus'' (Art museum) and ''Museum f\u00fcr Urgeschichte'' (Museum for ancient history). There are three archives that are included in the list; ''B\u00fcrgerarchiv Zug'' (Citizen's archive of Zug), ''Staatsarchiv Zug'' (State/Canton of Zug archive) and the ''Unternehmensarchiv der Landis & Gyr AG'' (Landis & Gyr AG company archives). The rest of the sites are the Catholic Church of St. Oswald with [[Charnel house]], the [[Seminary]] of St. Michael, the town walls and several buildings in the old town of Zug.<ref>[http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar.html Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501142322/http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar.html |date=1 May 2009 }} 21.11.2008 version, {{in lang|de}} accessed 22-Sep-2009</ref>\n\nThe prehistoric settlements at Oterswil/Insel Eielen, Riedmatt and Sumpf are part of the [[Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps]] a [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|World Heritage Site]].<ref name=UNESCO>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1363/ UNESCO World Heritage Site - Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps]</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe Zug education system is based on equal abilities and includes compulsory primary and secondary school, with optional secondary education and vocational training. Two thirds of young people go into vocational education, connected to an apprenticeship, joining the professional world after the 9th grade of secondary school. The international business community of Zug offers many and varied apprenticeships along with the Zug technical and industrial college, GIBZ, and the business college, KBZ, provide the academic knowledge and skills.\n\nZug has a long tradition of education. Private schools, like the Montana Institute Zug, on Zugerberg, or the Dr. Pfister Institute AG, Ober\u00e4geri supplement the range available. In addition, there are the three former non-state teacher training colleges in Menzingen, Holy Cross in Cham and St. Michael in Zug.\n\n===Tertiary education===\nCanton Zug has two high schools: the Canton High School in the town of Zug, and the Cantonal School in Menzingen. Also at higher secondary level, is the Vocational School Zug and the Business Studies School, incorporated within the Canton School. Zug is one of the university cantons, with, on the one hand, the University of Teacher Training, PHZ Zug, on the other, a polytechnic for financial services.\n\nThere are also six technical colleges (for business, computer science, engineering design, naturopathy and homeopathy, child education, and rescue services).\n\n===International Schools===\nThe range of educational institutions is a key factor for location in the globalized world of competition, especially for foreign employees, the so-called \u2018Expats\u2019. The four international schools have been developed accordingly, and report a high student intake. 1300 children from more than 50 countries attend the [[International School of Zug and Luzern]] alone, at its two campuses in H\u00fcnenberg and Baar.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Bahnhof Zug.jpg|thumb|The railway station]]\n[[File:MS Zug Schiffsstation Bahnhof Einsteigen.jpg|thumb|''MS Zug'']]\nZug acts as an important transportation node.\n\nAn extensive bus network within the town and canton is provided by [[Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe|ZVB Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe]].<ref name=ZVB>{{cite web |url=http://www.zvb.ch |title=Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe |publisher=Zug Town |accessdate=2015-12-26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Swiss Federal Railways]] link at [[Zug railway station]] for Cham - [[Horgen]] - [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]] - [[Affoltern am Albis]], [[Arth-Goldau]] - [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|St. Gotthard]] - [[Ticino]] and Italy, and [[Risch-Rotkreuz|Rotkreuz]] - [[Luzern]].

There have been Paleolithic finds on the north bank of Lake Zug, which come from nomadic hunters and gatherers. Archaeologists have also found over forty lake-shore settlements, known as [[pile dwellings]], on the shores of Lake Zug from the epoch of the first settled farmers in the [[Neolithic]] period (5,500-2,200 BC). The peak in these lake-shore village settlements was between 3800 and 2450 BC. For the same epoch, the first pre-alpine land use has been found in Menzingen and in the \u00c4geri valley. The well-known, historically-researched lake-shore village '' 'Sumpf' '' (the swamp), dated from the late Bronze Age (up until 850 BC). Evidence from these finds resulted in a quite different picture of life in former times, which is on display at the Zug Museum for Prehistory. In addition, finds from the Iron Age (850-50 BC) and the Roman and Celtic-Roman time (from 50 BC) have been unearthed.\n\n===Kyburg foundation===\nIn around AD 600, Alemannic families and tribes immigrated to the area of present-day canton Zug. The name Blickensdorf, and place names with \u2018- ikon\u2019 endings, prove this as the first Alemannic living space{{why|date=March 2018}}. The churches of Baar and Risch also date back to the early Middle Ages. \nThe first written document on the area originates from the year 858, and refers to King [[Ludwig the German]] giving the farm ''Chama'' (Cham) to the Z\u00fcrich Fraum\u00fcnster convent. At this time, the area of present-day Zug belonged to completely different monastic and secular landlords, the most important of whom were the Habsburgs, and who, in 1264, inherited the Kyburg rights and remained a central political power until about 1400.\n\nIn the course of the high medieval town construction, the settlement of Zug also received a town wall at some point after 1200. The town founders were probably the counts of [[County of Kyburg|Kyburg]]. The town, first mentioned in AD 1240, was called an \"[[oppidum]]\" in 1242 and a \"[[castrum]]\" in 1255. In 1273, it was bought by [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]] from Anna, the heiress of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] and wife of Eberhard, head of the [[cadet branch|cadet line]] of [[Habsburg]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}  Through this purchase it passed into the control of the Habsburgs and was placed under a Habsburg [[bailiff]]. The ''Aeusser Amt'' or Outer District consisted of the villages and towns surrounding Zug, which each had their own ''[[Landsgemeinde]]n'' but were ruled by a single Habsburg bailiff. Zug was important as an administrative center of the Kyburg and the [[Habsburg]] district, then as a local market place, and, thereafter, as a stage town for the transport of goods (particularly salt and iron) over the Hirzel hill towards Lucerne.\n\n===Joining the Swiss Confederation===\nOn 27 June 1352, both the town of Zug and the ''Aeusser Amt'' entered the [[Swiss Confederation]], the latter being received on exactly the same terms as the town, and not, as was usual in the case of outer districts, as a subject land. However, in September 1352 Zug had to acknowledge its own lords again, and in 1355 was obliged to break off its connection with the league. About 1364, the town and the Aeusser Amt were recovered for the league by the men of [[Schwyz]], and from this time Zug took part as a full member in all the acts of the league. In 1379, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Wenceslaus, Holy Roman Emperor|Wenceslaus]] exempted Zug from all external jurisdictions, and in 1389 the Habsburgs renounced their claims, reserving only an annual payment of 20 silver marks, which came to an end in 1415. In 1400 Wenceslaus gave all criminal jurisdiction to the town only. The Aeusser Amt, in 1404, then claimed that the banner and seal of Zug should be kept in one of the country districts and were supported in this claim by Schwyz. The matter was finally settled in 1412 by arbitration, and the banner was to be kept in the town. Finally in 1415, the right of electing their ''[[landammann]]'' was given to Zug by the Confederation, and a share in the criminal jurisdiction was granted to the Aeusser Amt by German king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe alliance of the four forest cantons of [[Uri (canton)|Uri]], [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]] and [[Lucerne]] with the city of Z\u00fcrich in 1351 set much in motion. The town of Zug was seen as having Habsburg ties with the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Lucerne, and therefore had to be conquered. It is likely that this was more for political than economic reasons: the Lucerne market was very important for central Switzerland, but also strongly dependent on the city of [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Z\u00fcrich initiated a siege on Zug with the federal army in June 1352. Zug surrendered. On 27 June 1352 Z\u00fcrich, Luzern, Zug, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed an alliance. Z\u00fcrich's saw this \u2018Zugerbund\u2019 (Zug alliance) as an alliance of convenience. For the town of Zug, little changed, and Zug remained Habsburg. That same year, the Zug alliance was declared invalid by all parties. A period of Schwyz domination then followed. Only gradually did Zug become sovereign and federal.\n\nSimultaneously, Zug expanded its territory, acquiring a number of rural areas in the form of bailiwicks ([[Walchwil]], [[Cham (Switzerland)|Cham]], Gangolfswil [Risch] [[H\u00fcnenberg]] and [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]], and Oberr\u00fcti, now part of the canton of Aargau). Zug became a confederation in itself - with the town and its subject territories, and the three outer (\u2018free\u2019) municipalities, [[\u00c4geri]], [[Menzingen]] (with [[Neuheim]]) and [[Baar, Switzerland|Baar]]. This problematic dualism dominated until 1798, i.e. until the end of the old confederation, the political structure of the Canton Zug. The unifying element of this miniature confederation was, among others, the rural municipalities and the forty-member city council.\n\n===Growth of the town===\nIn 1385, Zug joined the league of the Swabian cities against [[Leopold III of Austria (Habsburg)|Leopold III of Austria]] and shared in the victory of [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]], as well as in the various [[Aargau|Argovian]] (1415) and [[Thurgau|Thurgovian]] (1460) conquests of the Confederates, and later in those of Italy (1512), having already taken part in the occupation of the Val d'Ossola. Between 1379 ([[Walchwil]]) and 1477 ([[Cham, Switzerland|Cham]]), Zug had acquired various districts in its own neighborhood, principally to the north and the west, which were ruled till 1798 by the town alone as subject lands.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nIn 1478, the building of a larger town wall began, which increased the town area six-fold - the same year as the building of the late gothic St. Oswald Church began. The building master of the new town wall was Hans Felder from Bavarian Swabia. The ground plan of the town wall is indicative of an ideal symmetric plan of the Renaissance period \u2013 something very rare at that time. The overall urban planning implemented in the small town of Zug was modern for its time.\n\n===The Reformation and Early Modern Era===\nDuring the turmoil of the Reformation, Zug remained on the Catholic side of central Switzerland and retained the old faith. Warring religious confederates fought at Kappel am Albis (1531) and at Gubel in Menzingen. Its location on the edge of central Switzerland made Zug a confessional border town. During the Reformation, Zug clung to the old faith and was a member of the ''Christliche Vereinigung'' of 1529. In 1586, it became a member of the Golden League.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe period up until 1798 was marked by internal political rivalries and turbulence. The invasion of the French troops marked the end of the old order, and with the Helvetic order came a radical political change. Zug became part of the canton Waldst\u00e4tten, and the cantonal capital for a short time. After a 50-year struggle between federalism and centralism, between confederation and central state, between conservative and liberal-radical vision, in 1848, today's federal government of Switzerland emerged. Zug was given its current cantonal structure, consisting of eleven local municipalities.\n\n===Industrialization and internationalization===\nUntil well into the 19th century, Zug consisted of agricultural land. Actual industrialization began with the entrepreneur Wolfgang Henggeler, who in 1834 built a cotton mill in Unter\u00e4geri. This was followed by the two companies in Neu\u00e4geri and Baar.\nIn 1866, the American George Ham Page founded the first European condensed milk factory in Cham, which later merged with [[Nestl\u00e9]]. Industry in Zug was dominated by the company [[Landis+Gyr]], founded in 1896, and now owned by [[Toshiba]]. The connection to the Swiss railway network in 1864 was important, as was the connection of mountain and valley with an electric tram at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIn the second half of the century, dynamic expansion took place and Zug became a national and international financial and trading center, aided by its proximity to Z\u00fcrich, and by an attractive tax policy. In parallel, large industrial and commercial zones evolved; employment increased rapidly; the population rose sharply, and the building boom skyrocketed. Canton Zug catapulted itself into being at the top of the financially strong cantons. And the town today has become, as the British Guardian once wrote, \u2018a compass of the global economy\u2019.\n\n===Today===\nZug is a [[tax haven|low tax region]], and is headquarters for a number of multinational enterprises. The town's best known agricultural product is [[Kirsch]].\n\nOn 27 September 2001, an angry, unstable gunman, [[Friedrich Leibacher]], shot and killed 15 people including himself in the cantonal parliament of Zug. The event became known as the [[Zug Massacre]].<ref name=bericht>[http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf Untersuchungsrichterlicher Schlu\u00dfbericht] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006042522/http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf |date=6 October 2011 }} (German)</ref>\n\n[[File:Sunset over Zug.jpg|thumb|center|750px|Night view of Zug and its [[Lake Zug|lake]]]]\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\n[[File:City of zug oldtown aerial view \u8001\u9547.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Zug]]\nZug has an area (as of the 2004 survey) of {{Swiss area|1711|mi=on}}.{{Swiss area data|1711|QUELLE}}  Of this area, about 33.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 37.9% is forested.

Towards its northerly end, a monument marks the spot where a part of the shore slipped into the lake in 1887.\n\nThe older part of the town is rather crowded together, though only four of the wall towers and a small part of the town walls still survive.\n\nThe most striking old building in the town is the parish church of St Oswald (late 15th century), dedicated to [[Oswald of Bernicia|St Oswald]], king of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] (d. 642), one of whose arms was brought to Zug in 1485. The town hall, also a 15th-century building, now houses the Historical and Antiquarian Museum. There are some quaint old painted houses close by. A little way higher up the hillside is a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] convent in a striking position, close to the town wall and leaning against it. Still higher, and outside the old town, is the fine new parish church of St Michael, consecrated in 1902.\n\nThe business quarter is on the rising ground north of the old town, near the railway station. Several fine modern buildings rise on or close to the shore in the town and to its south, whilst to the southwest is a convent of Capuchin nuns, who manage a large girls' school and several other educational establishments.\n\nThe ''Museum of Prehistory Zug'' houses an important collection of archaeological remains, especially from the late [[Bronze Age]] ([[urnfield culture]]) settlement of [[Zug-Sumpf]]. Many of [[Catharine II of Russia]]'s relatives descended from Zug and became known as the [[Volga German]]s.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are three museums in the town: the Museum of Prehistory, which displays archaeological finds from Canton Zug; the castle houses the Museum of Cultural History of the town and Canton Zug, and the Zug Art Gallery attracts visitors with its exhibitions.<ref>[http://www.museenzug.ch Museums of Zug]</ref>\nSeveral municipalities also have their own local museum. The Casino Theatre in Zug and the Zug ''Burgbachkeller'', along with the ''Chollerhalle'' cultural center, are the most famous establishments. The event centers in Baar, Cham and Rotkreuz and the Zug youth scene (Galvanik, Podium Industrie 45) enrich the range of cultural events.\n\nZug is surrounded with mountains, rivers and lakes including the mountains Zugerberg and the Walchwilerberg Oberallmig, the H\u00f6hronen and the river Sihl. The Choller nature reserve is also near Lake Zug.\n\nSights within the town include the late Gothic church of St. Wolfgang, near H\u00fchnenberg, or St. Oswald in Zug, the old town of Zug with the Town Hall and the [[Zytturm, Zug|Zytturm]] (clock tower), the [[Huwiler Tower]], the Zurlaubenhof, feudal estate of the family Zurlauben, on the outskirts of the town.\n\nZug's culture also includes the famous Zuger cherry liqueur cake. Local specialties, in addition to the cherry and the cherry liqueur cake, include the Zug \u2018R\u00f6tel\u2019, a fine lake charfish, found on many menus.<ref>[http://www.zug-tourismus.ch/en/welcome.cfm Zug Tourism]</ref>\n\nThe [[IG Culture Zug society]] currently has some 200 members.\n\n===Heritage sites===\nThere are a number of Swiss [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage sites of national significance]] in Zug.

Two thirds of young people go into vocational education, connected to an apprenticeship, joining the professional world after the 9th grade of secondary school. The international business community of Zug offers many and varied apprenticeships along with the Zug technical and industrial college, GIBZ, and the business college, KBZ, provide the academic knowledge and skills.\n\nZug has a long tradition of education. Private schools, like the Montana Institute Zug, on Zugerberg, or the Dr. Pfister Institute AG, Ober\u00e4geri supplement the range available. In addition, there are the three former non-state teacher training colleges in Menzingen, Holy Cross in Cham and St. Michael in Zug.\n\n===Tertiary education===\nCanton Zug has two high schools: the Canton High School in the town of Zug, and the Cantonal School in Menzingen. Also at higher secondary level, is the Vocational School Zug and the Business Studies School, incorporated within the Canton School. Zug is one of the university cantons, with, on the one hand, the University of Teacher Training, PHZ Zug, on the other, a polytechnic for financial services.\n\nThere are also six technical colleges (for business, computer science, engineering design, naturopathy and homeopathy, child education, and rescue services).\n\n===International Schools===\nThe range of educational institutions is a key factor for location in the globalized world of competition, especially for foreign employees, the so-called \u2018Expats\u2019. The four international schools have been developed accordingly, and report a high student intake. 1300 children from more than 50 countries attend the [[International School of Zug and Luzern]] alone, at its two campuses in H\u00fcnenberg and Baar.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Bahnhof Zug.jpg|thumb|The railway station]]\n[[File:MS Zug Schiffsstation Bahnhof Einsteigen.jpg|thumb|''MS Zug'']]\nZug acts as an important transportation node.\n\nAn extensive bus network within the town and canton is provided by [[Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe|ZVB Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe]].<ref name=ZVB>{{cite web |url=http://www.zvb.ch |title=Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe |publisher=Zug Town |accessdate=2015-12-26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Swiss Federal Railways]] link at [[Zug railway station]] for Cham - [[Horgen]] - [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]] - [[Affoltern am Albis]], [[Arth-Goldau]] - [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|St. Gotthard]] - [[Ticino]] and Italy, and [[Risch-Rotkreuz|Rotkreuz]] - [[Luzern]].

However, the suitability of a PDF file for archival preservation depends on options chosen when the PDF is created: most notably, whether to embed the necessary fonts for rendering the document; whether to use encryption; and whether to preserve additional information from the original document beyond what is needed to print it.\n\nPDF/A was originally a new joint activity between the Association for Suppliers of Printing, Publishing and Converting Technologies ([[NPES]]) and the [[Association for Information and Image Management]] to develop an international standard defining the use of the Portable Document Format (PDF) for archiving documents.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/a-short-history-of-pdfa/ |title=A short history of PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> The goal was to address the growing need to electronically archive documents in a way that would ensure preservation of their contents over an extended period of time and ensure that those documents would be able to be retrieved and rendered with a consistent and predictable result in the future.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/the-most-important-reasons-to-use-pdfa/ |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |title=The most important reasons to use PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> This need exists in a wide variety of government, industry and academic areas worldwide, including legal systems, libraries, newspapers, and regulated industries.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/typical-uses-for-pdfa/ |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |title=Typical uses for PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe PDF/A standard does not define an archiving strategy or the goals of an archiving system. It identifies a \"profile\" for electronic documents that ensures the documents can be reproduced exactly the same way using various software in years to come. A key element to this reproducibility is the requirement for PDF/A documents to be 100% self-contained. All of the information necessary for displaying the document in the same manner is embedded in the file. This includes, but is not limited to, all content (text, raster images and vector graphics), fonts, and color information. A PDF/A document is not permitted to be reliant on information from external sources (e.g. font programs and data streams), but may include annotations (e.g. hypertext links) that link to external documents.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-6\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/09/pdfa-%e2%80%93-ein-blick-auf-die-technische-seite/?lang=de |title=The technical side of the PDF/A standard |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2017-08-07 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702191437/http://www.pdfa.org/2011/09/pdfa-%e2%80%93-ein-blick-auf-die-technische-seite/?lang=de |archivedate=2015-07-02 }}</ref>\n\nOther key elements to PDF/A conformance include:<ref name=\"pdfa1-tech\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/doku.php?id=artikel:en:pdfa_a_look_at_the_technical-side |title=PDF/A \u2013 A Look at the Technical Side |accessdate=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045349/http://www.pdfa.org/doku.php?id=artikel:en:pdfa_a_look_at_the_technical-side |archivedate=2011-07-26 }}</ref><ref name=\"pdfa2-press\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/07/pdfa-2-standard-published-by-iso-the-new-standard-includes-great-technical-enhancements-free-informative-webinar-to-be-scheduled/ |title=PDF/A-2 Standard Published by ISO!

Some PDF viewers allow users to disable the PDF/A viewing mode or to remove the PDF/A information from a file.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.adobe.com/acrolaw/2011/05/how-to-remove-pdfa-information-from-a-file/ |title=How to Remove PDF/A Information from a file |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://help.adobe.com/en_US/acrobat/X/standard/using/WSe6c6ee3e336ebb13-630c189912be99aedab-7fff.html#WS3E0E8467-B787-4020-A1D3-6BC762A42DF2.w |title=Change the PDF/A viewing mode |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nA PDF/A document must embed all fonts in use; accordingly, a PDF/A file will often be larger than an equivalent PDF file that does not include embedded fonts.\n\nThe use of transparency is forbidden in PDF/A-1. The majority of PDF generation tools that allow for PDF/A document compliance, such as the PDF export in OpenOffice.org or PDF export tool in Microsoft Office 2007 suites, will also make any transparent images in a given document non-transparent. That restriction was removed in PDF/A-2.<ref name=\"pdfa1-tech\" />\n\nSome archivists have voiced concerns that PDF/A-3, which allows arbitrary files to be embedded in PDF/A documents, could result in circumvention of memory institution procedures and restrictions on archived formats.<ref>{{citation |url=http://duff-johnson.com/2014/02/28/archivists-no-flowers-for-pdfa-3/ |title=Archivists: No flowers for PDF/A-3 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref>\n\nThe PDF Association had addressed various misconceptions<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.pdfa.org/the-myths-and-legends-surrounding-pdfa/ |title=The myths and legends surrounding PDF/A |accessdate=2018-02-15}}</ref> regarding PDF/A in its publication \"PDF/A in a Nutshell 2.0\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pdfa.org/resource/pdfa-in-a-nutshell-2-0/|title=PDF/A in a Nutshell 2.0}}</ref>\n\nConverting a PDF (up to version 1.4) into a PDF/A-2 usually works as expected, except for problems with [[glyph]]s. According to the PDF Association, \"Problems can occur before and/or during the generation of PDFs. A PDF/A file can be formally correct yet still have incorrect glyphs. Only a careful visual check can uncover this problem. Because generation problems also affect Unicode mapping, the problem attracts the attention when a visual check is carried out on the extracted text.\nIn PDF/A, text/font usage is specified uniquely enough to ensure that it cannot be incorrect.\nIf viewers or printers do not offer complete support for encoding systems, this can result in problems with regard to PDF/A.\"<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/08/pdfa-%E2%80%93-a-look-at-the-technical-side/ |title=PDF/A \u2013 A Look at the Technical Side |accessdate=2015-08-14}}</ref> Meaning that for a document to be completely compliant with the standard, it will be correct internally, while the system used for viewing or printing the document may produce undesired results.\n\nA document produced with [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) conversion into PDF/A-2 or PDF/A-3 doesn't support the <code>notdefglyph</code> flag. Therefore, this type of conversion can result in unrendered content.\n\nWhen documents are converted to PDF/A visual inspection is needed since errors in the visual content are common. In a test sample 11 percent of the produced PDF/A-1b document contained visual artefacts. These reproducibility errors included  vector graphics issues (transparent objects), loss of links, loss of other document content (unreadable characters, missing text, document part missing), updated fields (reflecting time or folder of conversion) and spelling errors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<br />\n==See also==\n* [[Digital dark age]]\n* [[PDF/E]]\n* [[PDF/VT]]\n* [[PDF/X]] \u2013 another subset of the PDF standard, optimized for print production\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://www.pdfa.org/publication/pdfa-in-a-nutshell-2-0/ PDF/A in a Nutshell 2.0] \u2013 published by PDF Association (2013)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20170107170545/http://www.crawfordtech.com/images/resources/PDF_A_101_An_Intro_Final.pdf PDF/A 101: An Introduction] \u2013 presentation from the First International PDF/A Conference (2008)\n* [http://www.pdf-tools.com/public/downloads/whitepapers/whitepaper-pdfa.pdf White Paper: PDF/A \u2013 The Basics] \u2013 from PDF Tools AG (2009)\n* [http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000125.shtml Format description for PDF/A-1] \u2013 at digitalpreservation.gov\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.pdfa.org/ PDF Association]\n* [http://www.pdfa.org/competence-centers/pdfa-competence-center/ PDF/A Competence Center] \n* [http://www.verapdf.org/ veraPDF] \u2013 PDF/A validation software\n\n{{ISO standards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pdf A}}\n[[Category:Archive formats]]\n[[Category:Computer file formats]]\n[[Category:Digital preservation]]\n[[Category:ISO standards]]\n[[Category:Page description languages]]\n[[Category:PDF standards]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|ISO-standardized version of PDF for archives}}\n{{Infobox file format\n| name                   = PDF/Archive\n| logo                   =\n| icon                   = \n| iconcaption            = \n| screenshot             = \n| caption                = \n| extension              = .pdf\n| mime                   = application/pdf\n| typecode               = 'PDF ' (including a single space)\n| uniform_type           = com.adobe.pdf\n| magic                  = <code>%PDF</code>\n| owner                  = [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]\n| released               = {{start date and age|2005|10|01}}\n| latest_release_version = \n| latest_release_date    = {{start date and age|2012|10|15}}\n| genre                  = \n| container_for          = \n| extended_from          = [[Portable Document Format|PDF]]\n| extended_to            =\n| standard               = ISO 19005\n| free                   =\n| url                    = \n}}\n\n'''PDF/A''' is an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]-standardized version of the [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) specialized for use in the [[archive|archiving]] and long-term [[digital preservation|preservation]] of [[electronic document]]s.

However, the suitability of a PDF file for archival preservation depends on options chosen when the PDF is created: most notably, whether to embed the necessary fonts for rendering the document; whether to use encryption; and whether to preserve additional information from the original document beyond what is needed to print it.\n\nPDF/A was originally a new joint activity between the Association for Suppliers of Printing, Publishing and Converting Technologies ([[NPES]]) and the [[Association for Information and Image Management]] to develop an international standard defining the use of the Portable Document Format (PDF) for archiving documents.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/a-short-history-of-pdfa/ |title=A short history of PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> The goal was to address the growing need to electronically archive documents in a way that would ensure preservation of their contents over an extended period of time and ensure that those documents would be able to be retrieved and rendered with a consistent and predictable result in the future.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/the-most-important-reasons-to-use-pdfa/ |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |title=The most important reasons to use PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref> This need exists in a wide variety of government, industry and academic areas worldwide, including legal systems, libraries, newspapers, and regulated industries.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2013/02/typical-uses-for-pdfa/ |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |title=Typical uses for PDF/A |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2014-07-11}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nThe PDF/A standard does not define an archiving strategy or the goals of an archiving system. It identifies a \"profile\" for electronic documents that ensures the documents can be reproduced exactly the same way using various software in years to come. A key element to this reproducibility is the requirement for PDF/A documents to be 100% self-contained. All of the information necessary for displaying the document in the same manner is embedded in the file. This includes, but is not limited to, all content (text, raster images and vector graphics), fonts, and color information. A PDF/A document is not permitted to be reliant on information from external sources (e.g. font programs and data streams), but may include annotations (e.g. hypertext links) that link to external documents.<ref name=\"nutshell-2-6\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/09/pdfa-%e2%80%93-ein-blick-auf-die-technische-seite/?lang=de |title=The technical side of the PDF/A standard |first=Alexandra |last=Oettler |website=PDF Association |date=2013-02-07 |access-date=2017-08-07 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702191437/http://www.pdfa.org/2011/09/pdfa-%e2%80%93-ein-blick-auf-die-technische-seite/?lang=de |archivedate=2015-07-02 }}</ref>\n\nOther key elements to PDF/A conformance include:<ref name=\"pdfa1-tech\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/doku.php?id=artikel:en:pdfa_a_look_at_the_technical-side |title=PDF/A \u2013 A Look at the Technical Side |accessdate=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045349/http://www.pdfa.org/doku.php?id=artikel:en:pdfa_a_look_at_the_technical-side |archivedate=2011-07-26 }}</ref><ref name=\"pdfa2-press\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/07/pdfa-2-standard-published-by-iso-the-new-standard-includes-great-technical-enhancements-free-informative-webinar-to-be-scheduled/ |title=PDF/A-2 Standard Published by ISO!

The Phase 3 testing and acceptance period concluded in July, 2017. veraPDF now covers all parts (1, 2 and 3) and conformance levels (a, b, u) of PDF/A.\n\nveraPDF is available for installation on Windows, macOS, or Linux using a PDFBox-based or \"Greenfields\" PDF parser.<ref name=\"verapdf-website\">\n{{cite web\n | title = Software\n | date = 30 June 2015\n | work = veraPDF\n | url = http://verapdf.org/software/\n | access-date = 2017-03-15\n}}  Page for downloading the platform-specific installer.\n</ref>\n\n== PDF/A viewers ==\nThe PDF/A specification also states some requirements for a conforming PDF/A viewer, which must\n* ignore any data that are not described by the PDF and PDF/A standards;\n* ignore any linearization information provided by the file;\n* only use the embedded fonts (rather than any locally available, substituted or simulated fonts);\n* only display using the embedded colour profile;\n* ensure that form fields do not change the rendered presentation and are rendered without regard to the form data;\n* ensure that annotations are rendered consistently.\n\nWhen encountering a file that claims conformance with PDF/A, some PDF viewers will default to a special \"PDF/A viewing mode\" to fulfill conforming reader requirements. To take one example, Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader 9 include an alert to advise the user that PDF/A viewing mode has been activated. Some PDF viewers allow users to disable the PDF/A viewing mode or to remove the PDF/A information from a file.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.adobe.com/acrolaw/2011/05/how-to-remove-pdfa-information-from-a-file/ |title=How to Remove PDF/A Information from a file |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://help.adobe.com/en_US/acrobat/X/standard/using/WSe6c6ee3e336ebb13-630c189912be99aedab-7fff.html#WS3E0E8467-B787-4020-A1D3-6BC762A42DF2.w |title=Change the PDF/A viewing mode |access-date=2014-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\nA PDF/A document must embed all fonts in use; accordingly, a PDF/A file will often be larger than an equivalent PDF file that does not include embedded fonts.\n\nThe use of transparency is forbidden in PDF/A-1. The majority of PDF generation tools that allow for PDF/A document compliance, such as the PDF export in OpenOffice.org or PDF export tool in Microsoft Office 2007 suites, will also make any transparent images in a given document non-transparent. That restriction was removed in PDF/A-2.<ref name=\"pdfa1-tech\" />\n\nSome archivists have voiced concerns that PDF/A-3, which allows arbitrary files to be embedded in PDF/A documents, could result in circumvention of memory institution procedures and restrictions on archived formats.<ref>{{citation |url=http://duff-johnson.com/2014/02/28/archivists-no-flowers-for-pdfa-3/ |title=Archivists: No flowers for PDF/A-3 |accessdate=2014-07-12}}</ref>\n\nThe PDF Association had addressed various misconceptions<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.pdfa.org/the-myths-and-legends-surrounding-pdfa/ |title=The myths and legends surrounding PDF/A |accessdate=2018-02-15}}</ref> regarding PDF/A in its publication \"PDF/A in a Nutshell 2.0\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pdfa.org/resource/pdfa-in-a-nutshell-2-0/|title=PDF/A in a Nutshell 2.0}}</ref>\n\nConverting a PDF (up to version 1.4) into a PDF/A-2 usually works as expected, except for problems with [[glyph]]s. According to the PDF Association, \"Problems can occur before and/or during the generation of PDFs. A PDF/A file can be formally correct yet still have incorrect glyphs. Only a careful visual check can uncover this problem. Because generation problems also affect Unicode mapping, the problem attracts the attention when a visual check is carried out on the extracted text.\nIn PDF/A, text/font usage is specified uniquely enough to ensure that it cannot be incorrect.\nIf viewers or printers do not offer complete support for encoding systems, this can result in problems with regard to PDF/A.\"<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.pdfa.org/2011/08/pdfa-%E2%80%93-a-look-at-the-technical-side/ |title=PDF/A \u2013 A Look at the Technical Side |accessdate=2015-08-14}}</ref> Meaning that for a document to be completely compliant with the standard, it will be correct internally, while the system used for viewing or printing the document may produce undesired results.\n\nA document produced with [[optical character recognition]] (OCR) conversion into PDF/A-2 or PDF/A-3 doesn't support the <code>notdefglyph</code> flag.

On this album, Henry Cow had expanded to include members of [[Slapp Happy]], who had merged with the group after the two had collaborated on ''[[Desperate Straights]]'' in 1974. The merger ended after recording ''In Praise of Learning'' when [[Peter Blegvad]] and [[Anthony Moore]] from Slapp Happy left the group.\n\n==Content==\n''In Praise of Learning'' was Henry Cow's most overtly political album.{{sfn|Piekut|2019|pp=200\u2013201}} Printed on the back of the album cover is filmmaker [[John Grierson]]'s quote \"Art is not a mirror \u2013 it is a hammer\", and the [[Tim Hodgkinson]] 16-minute composition, \"[[Living in the Heart of the Beast]]\" made explicit the band's left wing political leanings, with [[Dagmar Krause]]'s powerful voice adding a new dimension to their music.<ref name=Laing/> The [[Anthony Moore|Moore]]/[[Peter Blegvad|Blegvad]] song, \"[[War (Henry Cow song)|War]]\" was first recorded as \"War (Is Energy Enslaved)\"{{efn|The title of \"War (Is Energy Enslaved)\" was taken from the line \"For war is energy enslaved, but thy religion\" in the poem, ''Vala, or The Four Zoas \u2013 Night the Ninth'' by [[William Blake]].{{sfn|Cutler|2019|p=55}}<ref name=Stevenson2014>{{cite book|author=W.

He was not happy with the text on the cover and asked that it be omitted, as was done on ''Legend''{{'s}} cover. But his request was denied.
