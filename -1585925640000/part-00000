However, this [[sail plan]] is not as old-world as it might first appear. Using a lateen rig for this style boat shifts the advantage toward better performance in lighter air (less than 4 on the [[Beaufort scale]]) and contributes to it having good [[Running (sailing)|down-wind]] characteristics.\n\nThe hull\u2019s very mild \"V\" bottom and [[Chine (boating)|hard chine]] make Sunfish a most stable boat for its size, along with enabling it to sail on a [[Planing (sailing)|plane]] (hydroplane). Planing allows the boat to achieve a speed greater than theoretical [[hull speed]] based on length at waterline ([[Waterline length|LWL]]). Having a down-wind performance advantage helps the Sunfish to achieve a planing attitude at lower wind speeds than its high-aspect ratio sail plan counterparts.\n\nDesigned as a water-tight, hollow-body [[floats (nautical)|pontoon]], a hull like the Sunfish has is sometimes referred to as \"self-rescuing\" because the boat can be capsized and its cockpit swamped without threat of the boat sinking.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Sunfish Lessons.jpg|thumb|Children learning to sail in [[Dunewood, New York]]]]\n\n===Beginnings of Alcort, Inc.===\nIn 1945, Alex Bryan and Cortlandt Heyniger created the ''Alcort'' company to produce their first boat design, the [[Sailfish (sailboat)|Sailfish]]. Originally [[Framing (construction)|framing carpenters]] by trade, these two entrepreneurs began their sailcraft endeavors building [[iceboat]]s as a sideline. A proposal to build a lifesaving [[paddleboard]] for the Red Cross came their way. They determined the concept unfeasible as it stood. An improved design sporting a [[Canoe sailing#North American sailing canoes|sailing canoe]] sail rig did however strike a spark as a possible profit making venture. From that humble beginning the [[Sailfish (sailboat)|Sailfish]] was born and seven years later an improved design, the Sunfish.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">'''''The Sunfish Bible''''' by Will White, Omega<sup>3</sup> Press, Sarasota, FL \u2013 \"''Background on the Boat''\"</ref>\n\n[[File:1953 wooden Sunfish sailboat.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|1953 wooden Sunfish]]\n\n===The kit boat niche===\nThe first Sailfish were offered in the form of detailed drawings for the backyard builder or as a finished, ready-to-sail boat, built by the Alcort shop. In the course of growing their business, Cortlandt and Alex had the revelation to kit the boat by supplying pre-cut pieces, all the necessary fittings, and inclusion of the sail thereby making backyard construction more appealing to an even wider range of would-be boat builders. Sunfish first appeared as either a [[DIY]] kit or a finished boat. Of the two designs, only the ''Sailfish'' was originally a [[:File:Sailfish Drawing c1945 .png|blueprint]] plan boat.\n\n===Waypoints===\n* For the 1960 model year, Sunfish became available in a [[Glass-reinforced plastic|fiberglass]] version for the first time.

Sunfish Fleet, John Black Lee, independently experimented with a conventional sail rig for the Sunfish. He developed a high-[[aspect ratio]] [[sail]] that worked on the Sunfish hull and christened his design the Formula S. The high aspect ratio sail plan has better [[Points of sail#Reaching|upwind]] performance characteristics over the lateen sail, changing the boat's handling to [[Points of sail|point]] more like other [[Bermuda rig]] sailboats in its size. With this configuration, complexity of sail control is elevated by the addition of dynamic [[outhaul]], [[downhaul]], and [[mainsheet]] [[Mechanical traveller|traveller]] lines.\n\nLee's concept didn't interest Alcort, Inc. as a production model so he refit conversion boats independently and sparked organization of Formula S fleets. A few years after their 1969 purchase of Alcort, Inc., [[American Machine and Foundry|AMF]] revisited the idea of a high aspect ratio rig for the Sunfish. AMF did not choose to adopt Lee's Formula S design, they did however, develop their own variation calling it the Super Sunfish. The existing Formula S fleet eventually became assimilated into the ranks of AMF Super Sunfish fleets.\n\nThe Super Sunfish was available from 1974 to 1984. AMF marketed this more conventional sail plan as a performance version of the Sunfish in an attempt to compete with, among others, the newly emerging [[Laser (dinghy)|Laser]]. Portsmouth handicap numbers, however, place the Laser slightly faster. With its [[Chine (boating)|hard chine]] hull, the Super Sunfish is the more stable boat so it's a tradeoff between the two designs.\n\nThe Super Sunfish was offered as a complete package and as a kit to retrofit existing lateen rigged Sunfish. The literature points out the sail systems can be easily swapped on a single Sunfish hull to accommodate different sailors' preferences.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<center>\n{|border=\"1\"\n|+NORTH AMERICAN [[Portsmouth yardstick|PORTSMOUTH]] NUMBERS<ref>[http://offshore.ussailing.org/Portsmouth_Yardstick/Current_Tables/Centerboard_Classes.htm '''Centerboard Portsmouth Numbers'''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816160142/http://offshore.ussailing.org/Portsmouth_Yardstick/Current_Tables/Centerboard_Classes.htm |date=August 16, 2012 }} and Wind Dependent Handicaps - Centerboard Classes</ref>\n!

However, this [[sail plan]] is not as old-world as it might first appear. Using a lateen rig for this style boat shifts the advantage toward better performance in lighter air (less than 4 on the [[Beaufort scale]]) and contributes to it having good [[Running (sailing)|down-wind]] characteristics.\n\nThe hull\u2019s very mild \"V\" bottom and [[Chine (boating)|hard chine]] make Sunfish a most stable boat for its size, along with enabling it to sail on a [[Planing (sailing)|plane]] (hydroplane). Planing allows the boat to achieve a speed greater than theoretical [[hull speed]] based on length at waterline ([[Waterline length|LWL]]). Having a down-wind performance advantage helps the Sunfish to achieve a planing attitude at lower wind speeds than its high-aspect ratio sail plan counterparts.\n\nDesigned as a water-tight, hollow-body [[floats (nautical)|pontoon]], a hull like the Sunfish has is sometimes referred to as \"self-rescuing\" because the boat can be capsized and its cockpit swamped without threat of the boat sinking.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Sunfish Lessons.jpg|thumb|Children learning to sail in [[Dunewood, New York]]]]\n\n===Beginnings of Alcort, Inc.===\nIn 1945, Alex Bryan and Cortlandt Heyniger created the ''Alcort'' company to produce their first boat design, the [[Sailfish (sailboat)|Sailfish]]. Originally [[Framing (construction)|framing carpenters]] by trade, these two entrepreneurs began their sailcraft endeavors building [[iceboat]]s as a sideline. A proposal to build a lifesaving [[paddleboard]] for the Red Cross came their way. They determined the concept unfeasible as it stood. An improved design sporting a [[Canoe sailing#North American sailing canoes|sailing canoe]] sail rig did however strike a spark as a possible profit making venture. From that humble beginning the [[Sailfish (sailboat)|Sailfish]] was born and seven years later an improved design, the Sunfish.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">'''''The Sunfish Bible''''' by Will White, Omega<sup>3</sup> Press, Sarasota, FL \u2013 \"''Background on the Boat''\"</ref>\n\n[[File:1953 wooden Sunfish sailboat.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|1953 wooden Sunfish]]\n\n===The kit boat niche===\nThe first Sailfish were offered in the form of detailed drawings for the backyard builder or as a finished, ready-to-sail boat, built by the Alcort shop. In the course of growing their business, Cortlandt and Alex had the revelation to kit the boat by supplying pre-cut pieces, all the necessary fittings, and inclusion of the sail thereby making backyard construction more appealing to an even wider range of would-be boat builders. Sunfish first appeared as either a [[DIY]] kit or a finished boat.

Sunfish Fleet, John Black Lee, independently experimented with a conventional sail rig for the Sunfish. He developed a high-[[aspect ratio]] [[sail]] that worked on the Sunfish hull and christened his design the Formula S. The high aspect ratio sail plan has better [[Points of sail#Reaching|upwind]] performance characteristics over the lateen sail, changing the boat's handling to [[Points of sail|point]] more like other [[Bermuda rig]] sailboats in its size. With this configuration, complexity of sail control is elevated by the addition of dynamic [[outhaul]], [[downhaul]], and [[mainsheet]] [[Mechanical traveller|traveller]] lines.\n\nLee's concept didn't interest Alcort, Inc. as a production model so he refit conversion boats independently and sparked organization of Formula S fleets. A few years after their 1969 purchase of Alcort, Inc., [[American Machine and Foundry|AMF]] revisited the idea of a high aspect ratio rig for the Sunfish. AMF did not choose to adopt Lee's Formula S design, they did however, develop their own variation calling it the Super Sunfish. The existing Formula S fleet eventually became assimilated into the ranks of AMF Super Sunfish fleets.\n\nThe Super Sunfish was available from 1974 to 1984. AMF marketed this more conventional sail plan as a performance version of the Sunfish in an attempt to compete with, among others, the newly emerging [[Laser (dinghy)|Laser]]. Portsmouth handicap numbers, however, place the Laser slightly faster. With its [[Chine (boating)|hard chine]] hull, the Super Sunfish is the more stable boat so it's a tradeoff between the two designs.\n\nThe Super Sunfish was offered as a complete package and as a kit to retrofit existing lateen rigged Sunfish. The literature points out the sail systems can be easily swapped on a single Sunfish hull to accommodate different sailors' preferences.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<center>\n{|border=\"1\"\n|+NORTH AMERICAN [[Portsmouth yardstick|PORTSMOUTH]] NUMBERS<ref>[http://offshore.ussailing.org/Portsmouth_Yardstick/Current_Tables/Centerboard_Classes.htm '''Centerboard Portsmouth Numbers'''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816160142/http://offshore.ussailing.org/Portsmouth_Yardstick/Current_Tables/Centerboard_Classes.htm |date=August 16, 2012 }} and Wind Dependent Handicaps - Centerboard Classes</ref>\n!

The ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' names them the most successful British group of the 1970s based on sales of singles. They were the first act to have three [[single (music)|singles]] enter the charts at number one; all six of the band's [[record chart|chart-toppers]] were [[songwriter|penned]] by [[Noddy Holder]] and [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]]. As of 2006, total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best-selling single, \"[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]\", has sold in excess of one million copies.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=506}} According to the 1999 BBC documentary ''It's Slade'', the band have sold over 50 million records worldwide.(A Slade is also very tall,approximately 16 feet tall and has lots of mood swings.)<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pf7kr |title=BBC Four - It's Slade |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=12 April 2014 |accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nFollowing an unsuccessful move to the U.S. in 1975, Slade's popularity waned but was unexpectedly revived in 1980 when they were last-minute replacements for [[Ozzy Osbourne]] at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Rock Festival]]. The band later acknowledged this to have been one of the highlights of their career. The original line-up split in 1992, but reformed later in the year as Slade II. The band have continued, with a number of line-up changes, to the present day. They have also shortened the group name back to Slade.\n\nA number of artists from diverse genres have cited Slade as an influence, including [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Ramones]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Undertones]], [[The Runaways]], [[The Clash]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Quiet Riot]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[Cheap Trick]], and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]].

As Chandler had previous managerial experience with [[Jimi Hendrix]], the band accepted.<ref name=\"Holder\"/>\n\nChandler was not pleased with the debut album and thought the band would benefit from writing their own material and a change of image.

It has however been used in successful advertising campaigns in recent years.\n\nIn August 1978, Noddy Holder was reportedly involved in a brawl with a bouncer (Desmond Brothers) backstage at The Stoneleigh Club in [[Porthcawl]], [[South Wales]]. The bouncer was later jailed for three months for instigating the attack on Holder, after he had told the club bouncers to stop hurting the kids in the crowd who were pushed up against the stage, during the show. Holder showed his mettle by performing the next night as planned, although he had a broken nose, at a club in [[Cleethorpes]], Lincolnshire. The story of the attack would later be written into the 1981 single \"Knuckle Sandwich Nancy\", which Holder insisted would be released as a single. The band said in contemporary interviews that RCA and Chas Chandler objected to the single's release, so it came out on the [[Cheapskate Records|Cheapskate]] label, rather than on RCA, the label that they were contracted to.\n\nIn late 1978, the band released \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Bolero]]\", which was another commercial failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/2014127be |title=Slade - Rock 'n' Roll Bolero / It's Alright Buy Me - Barn - Belgium - 2014 127 |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref> As the band were still a respected live act, and because the 1972 album ''Slade Alive!'' had been so successful, the group decided to release another live album. ''[[Slade Alive, Vol. 2]]'' consisted of performances recorded during the 1976 Autumn tour of America and the 1977 Spring tour of the UK.\n\nIn 1979, the band released a further three singles: \"[[Ginny, Ginny]]\", \"[[Sign of the Times (Slade song)|Sign of the Times]]\" and a cover of the party track \"[[Hokey Cokey|Okey Cokey]]\". All failed to chart. The Slade newsletter of the time announced that \"Ginny, Ginny\" had made the top 200 in the UK but not the official top 100.<ref>{{cite web |title=From Roots To Boots!: Slade News Issue 4 |date=10 September 1950}}</ref> In October 1979, the band released a new studio album ''[[Return to Base]]'', the first album not to have Chandler as producer.<ref>{{cite book |title=Slade, Feel the Noize!: an illustrated biography |last=Charlesworth |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Charlesworth |year=1984 |publisher=Omnibus Press |location=London |isbn=0-7119-0538-X |pages=89\u201390 |url= }}</ref> Disagreements between Lea and Chandler, centring on business problems and Lea's desire to produce Slade's material, had been brewing since the recording of ''Whatever Happened to Slade'' in 1977. Lea in particular disagreed with Chandler on production decisions. As a result, Chandler offered to sever his association with the band. Slade, not wishing to be rid of Chandler entirely, asked him to stay on for the time being as their manager, which Chandler agreed to do.<ref>We'll Bring the House Down remastered booklet</ref> The album was a failure in the UK but the following year it topped both the Telemoustique chart and the official album chart in Belgium.{{who|date=November 2011}} Released exclusively in Belgium, the album's version of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"I'm a Rocker\" also made number 1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/6602796_orig.jpg|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120720214503/http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/6602796_orig.jpg|url-status=dead|title=6602796_orig.jpg (562x800 pixels)|archive-date=20 July 2012|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref><ref>Supporters Club Newsletter September \u2013 October 1981</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sladefanclub.weebly.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/3275309_orig.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 October 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120715021744/http://sladefanclub.weebly.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/3275309_orig.jpg |archivedate=15 July 2012  }}</ref>\n\nSlade's failures and lack of airplay led Lea to wonder if their material would be better received if recorded by another band. In late 1979, Lea formed [[The Dummies]] as a side project, with his brother Frank. They released three singles, which received plenty of radio airplay but sales suffered from distribution problems.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> In February 1980, Holder was briefly considered as a replacement for [[Bon Scott]], the recently deceased singer of [[AC/DC]]. Holder was said to have turned the position down, despite Slade's current situation, because of his loyalty to the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundchecks.co.uk/articles/noholder.html |title=noddy holder interview \u2013 at |publisher=Soundchecks.co.uk |accessdate=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405014451/http://www.soundchecks.co.uk/articles/noholder.html |archivedate=5 April 2005  }}</ref> In mid-1980, Slade released their first [[extended play]] titled \"[[Six of the Best (EP)|Six of the Best]]\" which featured three tracks from the ''Return to Base'' album and three brand new rock tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/ep/slade/six_of_the_best/ |title=Six of the Best by Slade : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Even though it was being sold for a lower than usual price of \u00a31.49, it still failed to sell enough to make a chart appearance. As a result, the band stopped working together and Hill started driving couples to their weddings in his own [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]], to earn money. The business never really took off, as Hill only drove one couple (a pair of fans).<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/>\n\n===Comeback and heavy metal following (1980\u20131982)===\n[[File:Slade at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|left|Slade performing at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff in December 1981.]]\n[[Ozzy Osbourne]] was due to play the Reading Festival in August 1980, during his [[Blizzard of Ozz]] tour, but cancelled at short notice as his band was not ready, leaving the organisers searching for a last-minute replacement. Slade were suggested, but Hill, still demoralised, had effectively left the band and initially refused to take part when asked by the other band members. Eventually, Chandler went to his home and convinced Hill to play what should have been a farewell performance in front of 65,000 rock fans, instead of Slade's disbanding and disappearing without a trace. To Hill's astonishment, the band stole the show and quickly became the darlings of the music press and radio. Highlights of their performance were broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Friday Rock Show]] Reading special. Afterwards, the band signed to Cheapskate Records, owned by Chandler, Lea and his brother Frank, which gave the band more control of their material and products.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"Holder\" />\n\nThe band's new-found success led to a hurriedly released extended play, ''[[Alive at Reading]]'', which reached number 44, the band's first chart action in the UK since 1977. Another extended play followed in November, titled \"[[Xmas Ear Bender (EP)|Xmas Ear Bender]]\" which peaked at number 70.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/cheap11 |title=Various Artists \u2013 Xmas Ear Bender \u2013 Cheapskate \u2013 CHEAP 11 |publisher=45cat |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Polydor Records also saw an opportunity to capitalise on the band's new success and released the compilation ''[[Slade Smashes!]]'' at the beginning of November. The album was given plenty of promotion and spent 15 weeks in the UK charts, peaking at number 21.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> The album was certified UK Gold in December, having by then sold over 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"autogenerated11\">We'll Bring the House Down remaster booklet</ref>\n\nKeen to keep momentum with their new fans, the band set out to write a song with hit potential. The idea for the new track came after a performance in [[Amsterdam]] at the [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] Club. An enthusiastic audience who would not go home were overheard chanting by Lea, who was downstairs in the dressing room. Realising the potential of the chant, the song \"[[We'll Bring the House Down (song)|We'll Bring the House Down]]\" was written and released in January 1981. Aimed at the new audience which consisted of mainly [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fans, it showed Slade's heavier rock sound.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated18\">Greatest Hits compilation booklet</ref> The single hit the number 10 spot in the UK, becoming Slade's first top ten hit since 1976.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> In March, an album consisting of four new tracks and six tracks from the previous album ''Return to Base'' was released. Also called ''[[We'll Bring the House Down]]'' it peaked at number 25.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/><ref name=autogenerated11 />\n\n\"[[Wheels Ain't Coming Down]]\", which originally appeared as the opening track on the album ''Return to Base'', was released in March 1981 and reached number 60 in the UK. Although not a hit, it served to keep Slade in the public eye while they were writing new material and planning a European tour.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> Slade's success at the 1980 Reading festival was helping them fill large venues<ref name=autogenerated15 /> and led to their being asked about a return in 1981. The band refused to return so soon, and opted to play the Castle Donnington Heavy Rock Festival instead.\n\nIn May, the band released \"[[Knuckle Sandwich Nancy (song)|Knuckle Sandwich Nancy]]\" which featured lyrics commenting on the assault on Holder in the Welsh nightclub. Although eagerly wanted as a single by the band, Chandler was not entirely convinced and thus it was half-heartedly released and failed to chart. The band blamed Chandler for losing interest, and began to manage themselves. Chandler sold his share of Cheapskate Records and negotiated a favourable deal for the band with [[RCA Records]]<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated15\">Till Deaf Do Us Part remaster booklet</ref> The new deal meant that Slade's records would get worldwide release except in the US and Canada. The next couple of UK singles would still be released under the Cheapskate label but with RCA pressing and distributing the records, then a full RCA release would start.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/5494355_orig.jpg|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120714230258/http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/5494355_orig.jpg|url-status=dead|title=5494355_orig.jpg (534x800 pixels)|archive-date=14 July 2012|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe band's first full release on the RCA label was the European hit single \"[[Lock Up Your Daughters (song)|Lock Up Your Daughters]]\" in late 1981.

The band came back with two possible singles, \"[[My Oh My (Slade song)|My Oh My]]\" and \"[[Run Runaway]]\". A raw demo of Holder singing \"My Oh My\" over Lea's piano, was received with particular enthusiasm by RCA. The label was delighted with both the tracks and hired outside producer [[John Punter]] to work with the band to record them. This was the first time the band had another producer since Chandler. Punter's methods differed to those Slade were used to, in that the band recorded all their parts separately. This method eventually met with the band's approval, except for Holder, who believed this method was ruining their unique chemistry and was losing their rock n roll edge.<ref>The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome remastered album</ref> The power ballad \"My Oh My\" was released in November 1983, where it slowly climbed the charts and by December, Slade found themselves competing for the Christmas number-one spot.

However, by the end of the month, Holder had decided to finally leave the band. He had become weary of the constant arguing and discontent within the band, and effectively managing their day-to-day affairs. He left after 26 years with the band to explore other career paths. Believing Holder to be an integral member of Slade, Lea also effectively retired from the band, preferring to work alone in the studio, rather than continue without Holder.

The ''[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' names them the most successful British group of the 1970s based on sales of singles. They were the first act to have three [[single (music)|singles]] enter the charts at number one; all six of the band's [[record chart|chart-toppers]] were [[songwriter|penned]] by [[Noddy Holder]] and [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]]. As of 2006, total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, and their best-selling single, \"[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]\", has sold in excess of one million copies.{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=506}} According to the 1999 BBC documentary ''It's Slade'', the band have sold over 50 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pf7kr |title=BBC Four - It's Slade |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=12 April 2014 |accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nFollowing an unsuccessful move to the U.S. in 1975, Slade's popularity waned but was unexpectedly revived in 1980 when they were last-minute replacements for [[Ozzy Osbourne]] at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Rock Festival]]. The band later acknowledged this to have been one of the highlights of their career. The original line-up split in 1992, but reformed later in the year as Slade II. The band have continued, with a number of line-up changes, to the present day. They have also shortened the group name back to Slade.\n\nA number of artists from diverse genres have cited Slade as an influence, including [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Ramones]], [[Sex Pistols]], [[The Undertones]], [[The Runaways]], [[The Clash]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Def Leppard]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Quiet Riot]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[Cheap Trick]], and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]. ''The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Music'' tells of Holder's powerful vocals, guitarist [[Dave Hill]]'s equally arresting dress sense, and the [[Sensational spelling|deliberate misspelling]] of their song titles (such as \"[[Cum On Feel the Noize]]\" and \"[[Mama Weer All Crazee Now]]\") for which they became well known.{{sfn|Du Noyer|2003|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n==Overview==\nAll members of Slade grew up in the [[Black Country]]. Drummer [[Don Powell]] bassist [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]] were born and raised in [[Wolverhampton]], lead vocalist [[Noddy Holder]] was born and raised in nearby [[Caldmore]], and lead guitarist [[Dave Hill]] moved to Wolverhampton from [[Holbeton]] as a child. Slade have released over 30 albums, three of which reached No. 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Roberts|2006|p=506}} Their releases have spent 315 weeks in the UK charts and they have earned 24 top 30 UK hits {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.<ref name=UKCharts>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/30945/slade/ |title=Slade - Official Uk Charts |publisher=www.officialcharts.com |accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nSlade dominated the UK singles charts during the early 1970s, outperforming chart rivals such as [[Wizzard]], [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[T.

Slade sold more singles in the UK than any other group of the 1970s.

Slade's career was unexpectedly revived when the band were asked to perform at the 1980 Reading Festival when [[Ozzy Osbourne]] pulled out at the last minute. For the next two years, the band produced material tailored towards the heavy metal scene and by 1984, they finally cracked the American market with the hits \"Run Runaway\" and \"My Oh My.\" This new-found success did not last long, however, and despite a top 25 UK hit in the early '90s the band split shortly after in 1992.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early years (1966\u20131970)===\n[[File:SladeSkinheads1969.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Slade in their skinhead phase in 1969<br/>from left: Powell, Lea, Holder, Hill.]]\n\nIn 1964, drummer [[Don Powell]] and guitarist [[Dave Hill]] were part of a Midland-based group called the Vendors.

During 1967, the band recorded the track \"Delighted to See You\" which remained unreleased until 1994, where it featured on the various artists compilation ''Psychedelia at Abbey Road''. Although the group did not record again for roughly two years, they built up a respectable reputation on the live circuit.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/>\n\nA local promoter, Roger Allen spotted the group in 1969 and alerted the head of [[A&R]] at [[Philips Records]], Jack Baverstock. The group spent a week in the Philips studio at Stanhope Place recording an album, after which Baverstock offered to sign the group to [[Fontana Records]] if they changed their name and obtained London-based management. The band were initially hesitant because of the reputation gained as the 'N Betweens' but eventually agreed to Ambrose Slade, a name inspired by Baverstock's secretary, who had named her handbag Ambrose and her shoes Slade.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"Holder\">{{cite book|title=Who's Crazee Now? |last=Holder |first=Noddy |authorlink=Noddy Holder|author2=Verrico, Lisa  |year=2000 |publisher=Ebury Press |location=London |isbn=0-09-187503-X |page= |pages= |url= }}</ref> Baverstock also found the group an agent, John Gunnel, who had previously worked with the entertainment entrepreneur [[Robert Stigwood]].\n\nThe band's debut album ''[[Beginnings (Ambrose Slade album)|Beginnings]]'', released in mid-1969, was a commercial failure, as was the instrumental single \"Genesis\" and the follow-up single \"[[Wild Winds Are Blowing]]\".<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref>Beginnings remastered album booklet</ref> While the album was being recorded, the band were visited by Gunnel and his business partner, [[The Animals|Animals']] bassist [[Chas Chandler]].

As Chandler had previous managerial experience with [[Jimi Hendrix]], the band accepted.<ref name=\"Holder\"/>\n\nChandler was not pleased with the debut album and thought the band would benefit from writing their own material and a change of image. The band adopted a [[skinhead]] look as an attempt to gain publicity from what was a newsworthy youth fashion trend, but this also added an unwelcome association with [[football hooliganism]].<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> Noddy Holder and Don Powell were particularly tough-looking individuals already, and the skinhead look exacerbated the disturbing effect of having \"toughs\" in the band. In 1970, the band shortened their name to Slade and released a new single, a cover of \"[[Shape of Things to Come (song)|Shape of Things to Come]]\" which, despite a performance on United Kingdom music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', failed to chart.<ref name=\"autogenerated17\">{{discogs artist}}</ref>\n\nChandler moved Slade to [[Polydor Records]], believing a higher-profile label would boost sales.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> Lyrics were added to the instrumental \"Genesis\" from the band's debut album, the result being released as \"[[Know Who You Are]]\", but again, the single failed to make any impression on the UK chart as did the album ''[[Play It Loud]]'', released in late 1970 and produced by Chandler himself.

Upon hearing the track played to him acoustically, a pleased Chandler predicted the song would make number one.

It has however been used in successful advertising campaigns in recent years.\n\nIn August 1978, Noddy Holder was reportedly involved in a brawl with a bouncer (Desmond Brothers) backstage at The Stoneleigh Club in [[Porthcawl]], [[South Wales]]. The bouncer was later jailed for three months for instigating the attack on Holder, after he had told the club bouncers to stop hurting the kids in the crowd who were pushed up against the stage, during the show. Holder showed his mettle by performing the next night as planned, although he had a broken nose, at a club in [[Cleethorpes]], Lincolnshire. The story of the attack would later be written into the 1981 single \"Knuckle Sandwich Nancy\", which Holder insisted would be released as a single. The band said in contemporary interviews that RCA and Chas Chandler objected to the single's release, so it came out on the [[Cheapskate Records|Cheapskate]] label, rather than on RCA, the label that they were contracted to.\n\nIn late 1978, the band released \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Bolero]]\", which was another commercial failure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/2014127be |title=Slade - Rock 'n' Roll Bolero / It's Alright Buy Me - Barn - Belgium - 2014 127 |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=8 January 2018}}</ref> As the band were still a respected live act, and because the 1972 album ''Slade Alive!'' had been so successful, the group decided to release another live album.

Slade, not wishing to be rid of Chandler entirely, asked him to stay on for the time being as their manager, which Chandler agreed to do.<ref>We'll Bring the House Down remastered booklet</ref> The album was a failure in the UK but the following year it topped both the Telemoustique chart and the official album chart in Belgium.{{who|date=November 2011}} Released exclusively in Belgium, the album's version of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"I'm a Rocker\" also made number 1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/6602796_orig.jpg|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120720214503/http://www.sladefanclub.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/6602796_orig.jpg|url-status=dead|title=6602796_orig.jpg (562x800 pixels)|archive-date=20 July 2012|access-date=27 September 2019}}</ref><ref>Supporters Club Newsletter September \u2013 October 1981</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sladefanclub.weebly.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/3275309_orig.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=18 October 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120715021744/http://sladefanclub.weebly.com/uploads/7/6/6/0/7660950/3275309_orig.jpg |archivedate=15 July 2012  }}</ref>\n\nSlade's failures and lack of airplay led Lea to wonder if their material would be better received if recorded by another band. In late 1979, Lea formed [[The Dummies]] as a side project, with his brother Frank. They released three singles, which received plenty of radio airplay but sales suffered from distribution problems.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> In February 1980, Holder was briefly considered as a replacement for [[Bon Scott]], the recently deceased singer of [[AC/DC]]. Holder was said to have turned the position down, despite Slade's current situation, because of his loyalty to the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soundchecks.co.uk/articles/noholder.html |title=noddy holder interview \u2013 at |publisher=Soundchecks.co.uk |accessdate=15 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050405014451/http://www.soundchecks.co.uk/articles/noholder.html |archivedate=5 April 2005  }}</ref> In mid-1980, Slade released their first [[extended play]] titled \"[[Six of the Best (EP)|Six of the Best]]\" which featured three tracks from the ''Return to Base'' album and three brand new rock tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/ep/slade/six_of_the_best/ |title=Six of the Best by Slade : Reviews and Ratings |publisher=Rate Your Music |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Even though it was being sold for a lower than usual price of \u00a31.49, it still failed to sell enough to make a chart appearance. As a result, the band stopped working together and Hill started driving couples to their weddings in his own [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]], to earn money. The business never really took off, as Hill only drove one couple (a pair of fans).<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/>\n\n===Comeback and heavy metal following (1980\u20131982)===\n[[File:Slade at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|left|Slade performing at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff in December 1981.]]\n[[Ozzy Osbourne]] was due to play the Reading Festival in August 1980, during his [[Blizzard of Ozz]] tour, but cancelled at short notice as his band was not ready, leaving the organisers searching for a last-minute replacement. Slade were suggested, but Hill, still demoralised, had effectively left the band and initially refused to take part when asked by the other band members. Eventually, Chandler went to his home and convinced Hill to play what should have been a farewell performance in front of 65,000 rock fans, instead of Slade's disbanding and disappearing without a trace. To Hill's astonishment, the band stole the show and quickly became the darlings of the music press and radio. Highlights of their performance were broadcast on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Friday Rock Show]] Reading special. Afterwards, the band signed to Cheapskate Records, owned by Chandler, Lea and his brother Frank, which gave the band more control of their material and products.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"Holder\" />\n\nThe band's new-found success led to a hurriedly released extended play, ''[[Alive at Reading]]'', which reached number 44, the band's first chart action in the UK since 1977. Another extended play followed in November, titled \"[[Xmas Ear Bender (EP)|Xmas Ear Bender]]\" which peaked at number 70.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/cheap11 |title=Various Artists \u2013 Xmas Ear Bender \u2013 Cheapskate \u2013 CHEAP 11 |publisher=45cat |accessdate=15 July 2011}}</ref> Polydor Records also saw an opportunity to capitalise on the band's new success and released the compilation ''[[Slade Smashes!]]'' at the beginning of November. The album was given plenty of promotion and spent 15 weeks in the UK charts, peaking at number 21.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> The album was certified UK Gold in December, having by then sold over 200,000 copies.<ref name=\"autogenerated11\">We'll Bring the House Down remaster booklet</ref>\n\nKeen to keep momentum with their new fans, the band set out to write a song with hit potential. The idea for the new track came after a performance in [[Amsterdam]] at the [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso]] Club. An enthusiastic audience who would not go home were overheard chanting by Lea, who was downstairs in the dressing room. Realising the potential of the chant, the song \"[[We'll Bring the House Down (song)|We'll Bring the House Down]]\" was written and released in January 1981. Aimed at the new audience which consisted of mainly [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fans, it showed Slade's heavier rock sound.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated18\">Greatest Hits compilation booklet</ref> The single hit the number 10 spot in the UK, becoming Slade's first top ten hit since 1976.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/> In March, an album consisting of four new tracks and six tracks from the previous album ''Return to Base'' was released. Also called ''[[We'll Bring the House Down]]'' it peaked at number 25.<ref name=\"officialcharts.com\"/><ref name=autogenerated11 />\n\n\"[[Wheels Ain't Coming Down]]\", which originally appeared as the opening track on the album ''Return to Base'', was released in March 1981 and reached number 60 in the UK. Although not a hit, it served to keep Slade in the public eye while they were writing new material and planning a European tour.<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/> Slade's success at the 1980 Reading festival was helping them fill large venues<ref name=autogenerated15 /> and led to their being asked about a return in 1981. The band refused to return so soon, and opted to play the Castle Donnington Heavy Rock Festival instead.\n\nIn May, the band released \"[[Knuckle Sandwich Nancy (song)|Knuckle Sandwich Nancy]]\" which featured lyrics commenting on the assault on Holder in the Welsh nightclub. Although eagerly wanted as a single by the band, Chandler was not entirely convinced and thus it was half-heartedly released and failed to chart. The band blamed Chandler for losing interest, and began to manage themselves. Chandler sold his share of Cheapskate Records and negotiated a favourable deal for the band with [[RCA Records]]<ref name=\"Charlesworth\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated15\">Till Deaf Do Us Part remaster booklet</ref> The new deal meant that Slade's records would get worldwide release except in the US and Canada.

The band came back with two possible singles, \"[[My Oh My (Slade song)|My Oh My]]\" and \"[[Run Runaway]]\". A raw demo of Holder singing \"My Oh My\" over Lea's piano, was received with particular enthusiasm by RCA. The label was delighted with both the tracks and hired outside producer [[John Punter]] to work with the band to record them. This was the first time the band had another producer since Chandler. Punter's methods differed to those Slade were used to, in that the band recorded all their parts separately. This method eventually met with the band's approval, except for Holder, who believed this method was ruining their unique chemistry and was losing their rock n roll edge.<ref>The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome remastered album</ref> The power ballad \"My Oh My\" was released in November 1983, where it slowly climbed the charts and by December, Slade found themselves competing for the Christmas number-one spot.

Believing Holder to be an integral member of Slade, Lea also effectively retired from the band, preferring to work alone in the studio, rather than continue without Holder.

Perhaps best known for his seven-fight stint in the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC), where he ultimately accumulated a 1-6 record, he also competed in the [[Cage Rage Championships]], [[K-1]], and [[Pancrase]]. He has fought all over the world including Tokyo, London, Montreal, and Las Vegas. He fought for the [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship]] at [[UFC 32]].\n\n==Biography==\nSinosic was born in Canberra, Australia to [[Croats|Croatian]] immigrant parents, and now resides in Sydney, Australia.

Having trained in various arts for over 20 years which takes back to his early twenties, Sinosic has been exposed to a myriad of art forms including: [[Freestyle Wrestling]], [[Tae Kwon Do]], [[boxing]], [[Jeet kune do]], [[Filipino martial arts]], [[Silat]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Capoeira]], [[Kickboxing]], [[Judo]], [[John Will (fighter)|JB Will]] [[Shootfighting]], [[Pankration]], [[Jujutsu]] and Machado BJJ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spma.net.au/instructors.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913194658/http://www.spma.net.au/instructors.php |archivedate=13 September 2009  }}</ref>\n\nCompeting on a national level since 1995 for major organizations such as the [[Abu Dhabi]] World Submission Championships, the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] and the [[K-1|K-1 Grand Prix]], Sinosic also fought in [[Pancrase]], [[RINGS]], Warriors Realm, Fighter Extreme, Universal Combat Challenge (UCC) (now called TKO Major League MMA (TKO)), [[Cage Rage]], Australian Vale Tudo Open and Caged Combat.\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\nConsidered a pioneer of Australian mixed martial arts, Sinosic fought on the first ever Australian MMA show, Caged Combat. He won the first ever Australian MMA title, the Australian Vale Tudo Heavyweight Championship. He was the first Australian to fight for a nominal World Title (Universal Combat Challenge 1 vs Dave Beneteau), and was the first Australian to fight in an MMA match in [[K-1]] when he lost at the [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2000]] vs Frank Shamrock. He was also the first Australian to fight in the UFC - [[UFC 30]] vs [[Jeremy Horn]] - his only winning performance with the organization, where he was the first Australian to fight for a UFC World Championship ([[UFC 32]] in a loss vs. [[Tito Ortiz]]). Sinosic was also  the first Australian to compete in the ADCC World Submission Wrestling Championships when he competed in the inaugural event in 1998.\n\n===UFC career===\nSinosic is a UFC veteran holding a record of 1 win and 6 losses within the UFC, contributing to the 8 wins\u201412 losses\u20142 draws in his mixed martial arts career. He made his UFC debut defeating [[Jeremy Horn]] by [[armbar]] at [[UFC 30]], considered a huge upset at the time, and was then offered a match with [[Tito Ortiz]], who was then the [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light Heavyweight Champion]] at [[UFC 32]]. Sinosic was defeated by Ortiz in the first round via [[Technical knockout]] (TKO).\n\nSubsequently, he fought several times in the UFC, with matches against [[Evan Tanner]] (TKO loss), [[Renato Sobral]] (decision loss), [[Forrest Griffin]] (KO loss), and [[Alessio Sakara]] (decision loss) at [[UFC 57]]. Following his largely unsuccessful stint with the UFC, he defeated regional fighters Shamoji Fuiji and [[Mark Epstein]] both by [[armbar]].\n\nSinosic's last fight in the UFC was a loss to [[Michael Bisping]] due to TKO (strikes) at [[UFC 70]].\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://martialarts.about.com/od/eventsandcompetitions/ig/UFC-70-Results/UFC-70---Bisping-vs-Sinosic.htm |title=Archived copy

{"title_page": "Discrete element method", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=November 2019}}{{distinguish|finite element method}}\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2019}}\nA '''discrete element method''' ('''DEM'''), also called a '''distinct element method''', is any of a family of [[numerical analysis|numerical]] methods for computing the motion and effect of a large number of small particles. Though DEM is very closely related to [[molecular dynamics]], the method is generally distinguished by its inclusion of rotational degrees-of-freedom as well as stateful contact and often complicated geometries (including polyhedra). With advances in computing power and numerical algorithms for nearest neighbor sorting, it has become possible to numerically simulate millions of particles on a single processor. Today DEM is becoming widely accepted as an effective method of addressing engineering problems in granular and discontinuous materials, especially in granular flows, powder mechanics, and rock mechanics. Recently, the method was expanded into the [[Extended Discrete Element Method]] taking [[thermodynamics]] and coupling to [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] and [[Finite element method|FEM]] into account.\n\nDiscrete element methods are relatively computationally intensive, which limits either the length of a simulation or the number of particles. Several DEM codes, as do molecular dynamics codes, take advantage of parallel processing capabilities (shared or distributed systems) to scale up the number of particles or length of the simulation. An alternative to treating all particles separately is to average the physics across many particles and thereby treat the material as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]].  In the case of [[solid]]-like granular behavior as in [[soil mechanics]], the continuum approach usually treats the material as [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] or [[Plasticity (physics)|elasto-plastic]] and models it with the [[finite element method]] or a [[Meshfree methods|mesh free method]].  In the case of liquid-like or gas-like granular flow, the continuum approach may treat the material as a [[fluid]] and use [[computational fluid dynamics]]. Drawbacks to [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]] of the granular scale physics, however, are well-documented and should be considered carefully before attempting to use a continuum approach.\n\n==The DEM family==\nThe various branches of the DEM family are the [[distinct element method]] proposed by [[Peter A. Cundall]] in 1971, the [[generalized discrete element method]] {{harv|Williams|Hocking|Mustoe|1985}}, the [[Discontinuous Deformation Analysis|discontinuous deformation analysis]] (DDA) {{harv|Shi|1992}} and the finite-discrete element method concurrently developed by several groups (e.g., [[Ante Munjiza|Munjiza]] and [[Roger Owen (mathematician)|Owen]]). The general method was originally developed by Cundall in 1971 to problems in rock mechanics. The theoretical basis of the method was established by Sir Isaac Newton in 1697<!-- 1967 is INCORRECT! --Aclariont Sept 25, 2009 (assumed a typo for now)-->. {{harvtxt|Williams|Hocking|Mustoe|1985}} showed that DEM could be viewed as a generalized finite element method.

The forces which act on each particle are computed from the initial data and the relevant physical laws and contact models. Generally, a simulation consists of three parts: the initialization, explicit time-stepping, and post-processing. The time-stepping usually requires a nearest neighbor sorting step to reduce the number of possible contact pairs and decrease the computational requirements; this is often only performed periodically.\n\nThe following forces may have to be considered in macroscopic simulations:\n* [[friction]], when two particles touch each other;\n* [[contact plasticity]], or recoil, when two particles collide;\n* [[gravity]], the force of attraction between particles due to their mass, which is only relevant in astronomical simulations.\n* attractive potentials, such as [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]], [[adhesion]], [[liquid bridging]], [[electrostatic attraction]]. Note that, because of the overhead from determining nearest neighbor pairs, exact resolution of long-range, compared with particle size, forces can increase computational cost or require specialized algorithms to resolve these interactions.\n\nOn a molecular level, we may consider:\n* the [[Coulomb force]], the [[electrostatic]] attraction or repulsion of particles carrying [[electric charge]];\n* [[Pauli exclusion principle|Pauli repulsion]], when two atoms approach each other closely;\n* [[van der Waals force]].\n\nAll these forces are added up to find the total force acting on each particle. An [[numerical ordinary differential equations|integration method]] is employed to compute the change in the position and the velocity of each particle during a certain time step from [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Then, the new positions are used to compute the forces during the next step, and this [[program loop|loop]] is repeated until the simulation ends.\n\nTypical integration methods used in a discrete element method are:\n* the [[Verlet integration|Verlet algorithm]],\n* [[velocity Verlet]],\n* [[symplectic integrator]]s,\n* the [[leapfrog method]].\n\n==Long-range forces==\n\nWhen long-range forces (typically gravity or the Coulomb force) are taken into account, then the interaction between each pair of particles needs to be computed. Both the number of interactions and cost of computation [[quadratic growth|increase quadratically]] with the number of particles. This is not acceptable for simulations with large number of particles. A possible way to avoid this problem is to combine some particles, which are far away from the particle under consideration, into one pseudoparticle. Consider as an example the interaction between a star and a distant [[galaxy]]: The error arising from combining all the stars in the distant galaxy into one point mass is negligible. So-called tree algorithms are used to decide which particles can be combined into one pseudoparticle. These algorithms arrange all particles in a tree, a [[quadtree]] in the two-dimensional case and an [[octree]] in the three-dimensional case.\n\nHowever, simulations in molecular dynamics divide the space in which the simulation take place into cells. Particles leaving through one side of a cell are simply inserted at the other side (periodic [[boundary condition]]s); the same goes for the forces. The force is no longer taken into account after the so-called cut-off distance (usually half the length of a cell), so that a particle is not influenced by the mirror image of the same particle in the other side of the cell. One can now increase the number of particles by simply copying the cells.\n\nAlgorithms to deal with long-range force include:\n* [[Barnes\u2013Hut simulation]],\n* the [[fast multipole method]].\n\n==Combined finite-discrete element method==\n\nFollowing the work by Munjiza and Owen, the combined finite-discrete element method has been further developed to various irregular and deformable particles in many applications including pharmaceutical tableting,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=R.

Several research groups have independently developed simulation software that agrees well with experimental findings in a wide range of engineering applications, including adhesive powders, granular flow, and jointed rock masses.\n* DEM allows a more detailed study of the micro-dynamics of powder flows than is often possible using physical experiments. For example, the force networks formed in a granular media can be visualized using DEM. Such measurements are nearly impossible in experiments with small and many particles.\n\nDisadvantages\n* The maximum number of particles, and duration of a virtual simulation is limited by computational power. Typical flows contain billions of particles, but contemporary DEM simulations on large cluster computing resources have only recently been able to approach this scale for sufficiently long time (simulated time, not actual program execution time). \n* DEM is computationally demanding, which is the reason why it has not been so readily and widely adopted as continuum approaches in computational engineering sciences and industry. However, the actual program execution times can be reduced significantly when graphical processing units (GPUs) are utilized to conduct DEM simulations,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=J. |last2=Qi |first2=H. |last3=Fang |first3=X.|last4=Lu |first4=L.|last5=Ge |first5=W. |last6=Wang |first6=X.|last7=Xu |first7=M. |last8=Chen |first8=F. |last9=He |first9=X. |last10=Li |first10=J.|doi=10.1016/j.partic.2011.01.003 |title=Quasi-real-time simulation of rotating drum using discrete element method with parallel GPU computing |journal=Particuology |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=446\u2013450 |year=2011 |pmid= |pmc=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Govender |first1=N. |last2=Wilke |first2=D.

Though DEM is very closely related to [[molecular dynamics]], the method is generally distinguished by its inclusion of rotational degrees-of-freedom as well as stateful contact and often complicated geometries (including polyhedra). With advances in computing power and numerical algorithms for nearest neighbor sorting, it has become possible to numerically simulate millions of particles on a single processor. Today DEM is becoming widely accepted as an effective method of addressing engineering problems in granular and discontinuous materials, especially in granular flows, powder mechanics, and rock mechanics. Recently, the method was expanded into the [[Extended Discrete Element Method]] taking [[thermodynamics]] and coupling to [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] and [[Finite element method|FEM]] into account.\n\nDiscrete element methods are relatively computationally intensive, which limits either the length of a simulation or the number of particles. Several DEM codes, as do molecular dynamics codes, take advantage of parallel processing capabilities (shared or distributed systems) to scale up the number of particles or length of the simulation. An alternative to treating all particles separately is to average the physics across many particles and thereby treat the material as a [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]].  In the case of [[solid]]-like granular behavior as in [[soil mechanics]], the continuum approach usually treats the material as [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] or [[Plasticity (physics)|elasto-plastic]] and models it with the [[finite element method]] or a [[Meshfree methods|mesh free method]].  In the case of liquid-like or gas-like granular flow, the continuum approach may treat the material as a [[fluid]] and use [[computational fluid dynamics]]. Drawbacks to [[Homogenization (chemistry)|homogenization]] of the granular scale physics, however, are well-documented and should be considered carefully before attempting to use a continuum approach.\n\n==The DEM family==\nThe various branches of the DEM family are the [[distinct element method]] proposed by [[Peter A.

Then, the new positions are used to compute the forces during the next step, and this [[program loop|loop]] is repeated until the simulation ends.\n\nTypical integration methods used in a discrete element method are:\n* the [[Verlet integration|Verlet algorithm]],\n* [[velocity Verlet]],\n* [[symplectic integrator]]s,\n* the [[leapfrog method]].\n\n==Long-range forces==\n\nWhen long-range forces (typically gravity or the Coulomb force) are taken into account, then the interaction between each pair of particles needs to be computed. Both the number of interactions and cost of computation [[quadratic growth|increase quadratically]] with the number of particles. This is not acceptable for simulations with large number of particles. A possible way to avoid this problem is to combine some particles, which are far away from the particle under consideration, into one pseudoparticle. Consider as an example the interaction between a star and a distant [[galaxy]]: The error arising from combining all the stars in the distant galaxy into one point mass is negligible. So-called tree algorithms are used to decide which particles can be combined into one pseudoparticle. These algorithms arrange all particles in a tree, a [[quadtree]] in the two-dimensional case and an [[octree]] in the three-dimensional case.\n\nHowever, simulations in molecular dynamics divide the space in which the simulation take place into cells. Particles leaving through one side of a cell are simply inserted at the other side (periodic [[boundary condition]]s); the same goes for the forces. The force is no longer taken into account after the so-called cut-off distance (usually half the length of a cell), so that a particle is not influenced by the mirror image of the same particle in the other side of the cell. One can now increase the number of particles by simply copying the cells.\n\nAlgorithms to deal with long-range force include:\n* [[Barnes\u2013Hut simulation]],\n* the [[fast multipole method]].\n\n==Combined finite-discrete element method==\n\nFollowing the work by Munjiza and Owen, the combined finite-discrete element method has been further developed to various irregular and deformable particles in many applications including pharmaceutical tableting,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=R.

Several research groups have independently developed simulation software that agrees well with experimental findings in a wide range of engineering applications, including adhesive powders, granular flow, and jointed rock masses.\n* DEM allows a more detailed study of the micro-dynamics of powder flows than is often possible using physical experiments. For example, the force networks formed in a granular media can be visualized using DEM. Such measurements are nearly impossible in experiments with small and many particles.\n\nDisadvantages\n* The maximum number of particles, and duration of a virtual simulation is limited by computational power. Typical flows contain billions of particles, but contemporary DEM simulations on large cluster computing resources have only recently been able to approach this scale for sufficiently long time (simulated time, not actual program execution time). \n* DEM is computationally demanding, which is the reason why it has not been so readily and widely adopted as continuum approaches in computational engineering sciences and industry. However, the actual program execution times can be reduced significantly when graphical processing units (GPUs) are utilized to conduct DEM simulations,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Xu |first1=J. |last2=Qi |first2=H. |last3=Fang |first3=X.|last4=Lu |first4=L.|last5=Ge |first5=W. |last6=Wang |first6=X.|last7=Xu |first7=M. |last8=Chen |first8=F. |last9=He |first9=X. |last10=Li |first10=J.|doi=10.1016/j.partic.2011.01.003 |title=Quasi-real-time simulation of rotating drum using discrete element method with parallel GPU computing |journal=Particuology |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=446\u2013450 |year=2011 |pmid= |pmc=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Govender |first1=N. |last2=Wilke |first2=D.

As a result, the independent body, the State Tax Inspectorate of the Republic of Azerbaijan was established.\n\nBy the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated 11 February 2000, the General State Tax Inspectorate was revoked and the Ministry of the Taxes was established to ensure proper state tax policy, timely and full collection of taxes and other mandatory payments as well as

Since that time the tax service began its activity.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1991 tax matters in Azerbaijan were made part of the tax system\u00a0 of the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter restoration of the independence in July 1990, a Tax Service was set up within the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Azerbaijan to ensure timely and full collection of taxes and other mandatory payments\u00a0 in the Republic of Azerbaijan, as well as to ensure the state control over legal and physical persons' compliance with tax legislation and state pricing discipline.\n\nIn October 1991, Tax Service was separated from the Ministry of Finance for the purpose of improving supervision over compliance to tax legislation, strengthening the role of the state tax service in this area and ensuring the objectivity of its independent activities and supervision. As a result, the independent body, the State Tax Inspectorate of the Republic of Azerbaijan was established.\n\nBy the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated 11 February 2000, the General State Tax Inspectorate was revoked and the Ministry of the Taxes was established to ensure proper state tax policy, timely and full collection of taxes and other mandatory payments as well as state control over that area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.taxes.gov.az/modul.php?name=haqqinda&news=69|title=\u00abAz\u0259rbaycan Respublikas\u0131 Vergil\u0259r Nazirliyinin yarad\u0131lmas\u0131

(An '''integral square''' is a [[square (geometry)|square]] whose sides have [[integer]] length.) The name was coined in a humorous analogy with [[squaring the circle]]. Squaring the square is an easy task unless additional conditions are set.  The most studied restriction is that the squaring be '''perfect''', meaning the sizes of the smaller squares are all different. A related problem is '''squaring the plane''', which can be done even with the restriction that each natural number occurs exactly once as a size of a square in the tiling. The order of a squared square is its number of constituent squares.\n\n== Perfect squared squares ==\n\n[[File:Smith diagram.png|right|thumb|300px|Smith diagram of a rectangle]]\n\nA \"perfect\" squared square is a square such that each of the smaller squares has a different size.\n\nIt is first recorded as being studied by  [[R. Leonard Brooks|R. L. Brooks]], [[Cedric Smith (statistician)|C. A. B. Smith]], [[Arthur Harold Stone|A. H. Stone]] and [[W. T. Tutte]] at Cambridge University between 1936 and 1938.\nThey transformed the square tiling into an equivalent [[electrical circuit]] \u2014 they called it a \"Smith diagram\" \u2014 by considering the squares as [[resistor]]s that connected to their neighbors at their top and bottom edges, and then applied [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] and [[circuit decomposition]] techniques to that circuit.  The first perfect squared squares they found were of order 69.\n\nThe first perfect squared square to be published, a compound one of side 4205 and order 55, was found by [[Roland Sprague]] in 1939.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-games5 |title=5. Towards a theory for combinatorial games |website=[[American Mathematical Society]] |accessdate=2017-06-30}}</ref>\n\n[[Martin Gardner]] published an extensive article written by [[W. T. Tutte]] about the early history of squaring the square in his [[List of Martin Gardner Mathematical Games columns|mathematical games column]] in November 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squaring.net/history_theory/brooks_smith_stone_tutte_II.html|title=Brooks, Smith, Stone and Tutte, II|author=|date=|website=www.squaring.net|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Squaring the square.svg|right|thumb|Lowest-order perfect squared square]]\n\n== Simple squared squares ==\n\nA \"simple\" squared square is one where no subset of the squares forms a rectangle or square, otherwise it is \"compound\".\n\nIn 1978, A. J. W. Duijvestijn discovered a simple perfect squared square of side 112 with the smallest number of squares using a computer search. His tiling uses 21 squares, and has been proved to be minimal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerfectSquareDissection.html|title=Perfect Square Dissection|first=Weisstein, Eric|last=W.|date=|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> This squared square forms the logo of the [[Trinity Mathematical Society]].\n\nDuijvestijn also found two simple perfect squared squares of sides 110 but each comprising 22 squares. T.H. Willcocks found another. In 1999, I. Gambini proved that these three are the smallest perfect squared squares in terms of side length.<ref>{{cite web|title=Squared Squares; Perfect Simples, Perfect Compounds and Imperfect Simples|url=http://squaring.net/sq/ss/ss.html|accessdate=25 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe perfect compound squared square with the fewest squares was discovered by T.H. Willcocks in 1946 and has 24 squares; however, it was not until 1982 that Duijvestijn, [[Pasquale Joseph Federico]] and P.

C. Shephard stated that in all perfect integral tilings of the plane known at that time, the sizes of the squares [[exponential growth|grew exponentially]]. For example, the plane can be tiled with different integral squares, but not for every integer, by recursively taking any perfect squared square and enlarging it so that the formerly smallest tile now has the size of the original squared square, then replacing this tile with a copy of the original squared square.\n\nIn 2008 James Henle and Frederick Henle proved that this, in fact, can be done.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Henle | first1 = Frederick V. | last2 = Henle | first2 = James M. | year = 2008 | title = Squaring the plane | journal = American Mathematical Monthly | volume = 115 | issue = | pages = 3\u201312 | jstor=27642387}}</ref>  Their proof is constructive and proceeds by \"puffing up\" an L-shaped region formed by two side-by-side and horizontally flush squares of different sizes to a perfect tiling of a larger rectangular region, then adjoining the square of the smallest size not yet used to get another, larger L-shaped region. The squares added during the puffing up procedure have sizes that have not yet appeared in the construction and the procedure is set up so that the resulting rectangular regions are expanding in all four directions, which leads to a tiling of the whole plane.\n\n== Cubing the cube ==\n\n'''Cubing the cube''' is the analogue in three dimensions of squaring the square: that is, given a [[cube]] ''C'', the problem of dividing it into finitely many smaller cubes, no two congruent.\n\nUnlike the case of squaring the square, a hard yet solvable problem, there is no perfect cubed cube and, more generally, no dissection of a [[Cuboid#Rectangular cuboid|rectangular cuboid]] ''C'' into a finite number of unequal cubes.\n\nTo prove this, we start with the following claim: for any perfect dissection of a ''rectangle'' in squares, the smallest square in this dissection does not lie on an edge of the rectangle. Indeed, each corner square has a smaller adjacent edge square, and the smallest edge square is adjacent to smaller squares not on the edge.\n\nNow suppose that there is a perfect dissection of a rectangular cuboid in cubes. Make a face of ''C'' its horizontal base. The base is divided into a perfect squared rectangle ''R'' by the cubes which rest on it. The smallest square ''s''<sub>1</sub> in ''R'' is surrounded by ''larger'', and therefore ''higher'', cubes. Hence the upper face of the cube on ''s''<sub>1</sub> is divided into a perfect squared square by the cubes which rest on it. Let ''s''<sub>2</sub> be the smallest square in this dissection. By the claim above, this is surrounded on all 4 sides by squares which are larger than ''s''<sub>2</sub> and therefore higher.\n\nThe sequence of squares ''s''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub>, ... is infinite and the corresponding cubes are infinite in number.

(An '''integral square''' is a [[square (geometry)|square]] whose sides have [[integer]] length.) The name was coined in a humorous analogy with [[squaring the circle]]. Squaring the square is an easy task unless additional conditions are set.  The most studied restriction is that the squaring be '''perfect''', meaning the sizes of the smaller squares are all different. A related problem is '''squaring the plane''', which can be done even with the restriction that each natural number occurs exactly once as a size of a square in the tiling. The order of a squared square is its number of constituent squares.\n\n== Perfect squared squares ==\n\n[[File:Smith diagram.png|right|thumb|300px|Smith diagram of a rectangle]]\n\nA \"perfect\" squared square is a square such that each of the smaller squares has a different size.\n\nIt is first recorded as being studied by  [[R. Leonard Brooks|R. L. Brooks]], [[Cedric Smith (statistician)|C. A. B. Smith]], [[Arthur Harold Stone|A. H. Stone]] and [[W. T. Tutte]] at Cambridge University between 1936 and 1938.\nThey transformed the square tiling into an equivalent [[electrical circuit]] \u2014 they called it a \"Smith diagram\" \u2014 by considering the squares as [[resistor]]s that connected to their neighbors at their top and bottom edges, and then applied [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] and [[circuit decomposition]] techniques to that circuit.  The first perfect squared squares they found were of order 69.\n\nThe first perfect squared square to be published, a compound one of side 4205 and order 55, was found by [[Roland Sprague]] in 1939.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/samplings/feature-column/fcarc-games5 |title=5. Towards a theory for combinatorial games |website=[[American Mathematical Society]] |accessdate=2017-06-30}}</ref>\n\n[[Martin Gardner]] published an extensive article written by [[W. T.

J. W. Duijvestijn discovered a simple perfect squared square of side 112 with the smallest number of squares using a computer search. His tiling uses 21 squares, and has been proved to be minimal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerfectSquareDissection.html|title=Perfect Square Dissection|first=Weisstein, Eric|last=W.|date=|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> This squared square forms the logo of the [[Trinity Mathematical Society]].\n\nDuijvestijn also found 2 simple perfect squared squares of sides 110 but each comprising 22 squares. T.H. Willcocks found another. In 1999, I. Gambini proved that these 3 are the smallest perfect squared squares in terms of side length.<ref>{{cite web|title=Squared Squares; Perfect Simples, Perfect Compounds and Imperfect Simples|url=http://squaring.net/sq/ss/ss.html|accessdate=25 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe perfect compound squared square with the fewest squares was discovered by T.H. Willcocks in 1946 and has 24 squares; however, it was not until 1982 that Duijvestijn, [[Pasquale Joseph Federico]] and P. Leeuw mathematically proved it to be the lowest-order example.<ref>\"Compound Perfect Squares\", By A. J. W. Duijvestijn, P. J. Federico, and P.

''Chess Fever'' is a comedy about the [[Moscow 1925 chess tournament]], made by Pudovkin during the pause in the filming of ''[[Mechanics of the Brain]]''.<ref>Leyda 1960, p. 174.</ref> The film combines acted parts with actual footage from the tournament.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Moscow during the world chess tournament of 1925, the hero ([[Vladimir Fogel]]) and heroine (Anna Zemtsova) of the story are engaged to be married. Caught up in a society-wide chess fever, the hero forgets about his marital obligations and must beg for her forgiveness. As he kneels before his dismayed fianc\u00e9e on a checkered cloth, the hero becomes distracted and starts to play chess. Enraged, the heroine throws his chess themed belongings out of the window and forces him to leave. Now separated, the heroine finds herself at a pharmacy, intending to obtain poison to kill herself. Meanwhile, the hero dejectedly sits on a bridge above a river, throwing what's left of his chess possessions into the water. Rather than throwing himself off the bridge as well, he realizes the importance of love and resolves to find the heroine and apologize. It is at this time that the heroine raises what she thinks is a vial of poison to her lips. However, she is stopped when she realizes that she was mistakenly given a chess piece by the distracted chemist. The heroine's distress is interrupted by [[World Chess Champion]] [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], who tells her that, in the company of a beautiful woman, he too hates chess.

''Chess Fever'' is a comedy about the [[Moscow 1925 chess tournament]], made by Pudovkin during the pause in the filming of ''[[Mechanics of the Brain]]''.<ref>Leyda 1960, p. 174.</ref> The film combines acted parts with actual footage from the tournament.\n\n==Plot==\nIn Moscow during the world chess tournament of 1925, the hero ([[Vladimir Fogel]]) and heroine (Anna Zemtsova) of the story are engaged to be married. Caught up in a society-wide chess fever, the hero forgets about his martial obligations and must beg for her forgiveness. As he kneels before his dismayed fianc\u00e9e on a checkered cloth, the hero becomes distracted and starts to play chess. Enraged, the heroine throws his chess themed belongings out of the window and forces him to leave. Now separated, the heroine finds herself at a pharmacy, intending to obtain poison to kill herself. Meanwhile, the hero dejectedly sits on a bridge above a river, throwing what's left of his chess possessions into the water. Rather than throwing himself off the bridge as well, he realizes the importance of love and resolves to find the heroine and apologize. It is at this time that the heroine raises what she thinks is a vial of poison to her lips. However, she is stopped when she realizes that she was mistakenly given a chess piece by the distracted chemist. The heroine's distress is interrupted by [[World Chess Champion]] [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]], who tells her that, in the company of a beautiful woman, he too hates chess. The two become friends and drive off as the hero arrives. The hero, with nothing left to do but return to chess, attends the tournament. Looking into the crowd, he is shocked to find his fianc\u00e9e excitedly watching the game. He runs to her and the two embrace, united by their love for chess, and the film ends with them playing the game together.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca]] \u2013 the World Champion\n* [[Vladimir Fogel]] \u2013 the hero\n* Anna Zemtsova \u2013 the heroine\n* Natalya Glan\n* Zakhar Darevsky\n*[[Boris Barnet]]\n* [[Frank Marshall (chess player)|Frank Marshall]] \u2013 himself (cameo)\n* [[Richard R\u00e9ti]] \u2013 himself (cameo)\n* [[Carlos Torre Repetto]] \u2013 himself (cameo)\n* [[Frederick Yates (chess player)|Frederick Yates]] \u2013 himself (cameo)\n* [[Ernst Gr\u00fcnfeld]] \u2013 himself (cameo)\n* [[Mikhail Zharov]] \u2013 house painter\n* [[Anatoli Ktorov]] \u2013 tram passenger\n* [[Yakov Protazanov]] \u2013 chemist\n* [[Yuli Raizman]] \u2013 chemist's assistant\n* [[Ivan Koval-Samborsky]] \u2013 policeman\t\t\n* Konstantin Eggert\n* [[Fyodor Otsep]] \u2013 game spectator (uncredited)\n* Sergei Komarov \u2013 grandfather (uncredited)\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\n''Chess Fever'' is the directorial debut of [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]], who had previously worked as a screenwriter, actor, and art director, and as an assistant to [[Lev Kuleshov]].

The first single from their album, \"Rattlesnake Kisses\", featured actress [[Christina Applegate]] in the video<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.themanamalstreamingradio.com/4/post/2018/09/electric-angels.html|title=Electric Angels|website=The Manamal Streaming Radio|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>.  \n\nThe band cited their musical influences including [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], [[Ramones|The Ramones]], The Replacements, [[Rick Springfield]] and [[George Jones]] and toured with New Jersey rockers [[Danger Danger]], former [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] guitarist [[Ace Frehley]] and Phoenix rockers [[Icon (band)]].  Amongst the Angel's biggest fans are the Tattooed Angels, known for their lovely dispositions as well as sporting Electric Angels purple, red and black Coat of Arms tattoos.\n\nHome demos were made for early song ideas, though a second album was only in the infancy stages. These demos have erroneously turned up as the never-released second album, which was to be called ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'', though against the band's wishes or approval<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rarebird9.blogspot.com/2015/01/electric-angels-1990.html|title=Electric Angels (1990)|website=Electric Angels (1990)|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>.  The band let their contract with Atlantic expire in 1991 due to poor promotion on the part of the label and the album was shelved. \n\nThe second Electric Angels album was finally released in early 2017<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockandmetalinmyblood.com/recensioni/electric-angels-lost-in-the-atlantic/2017-demon-doll-records/3077|title=Rock & Metal In My Blood|website=Rock & Metal In My Blood|language=it|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref> on the [[Demon Doll]] label as a \"Limited Addiction\" release called [[\"Lost in the Atlantic\"]], a play on the name of their former record company<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sleazeroxx.com/reviews/electric-angels-lost-in-the-atlantic/|title=Electric Angels: \u2018Lost In The Atlantic\u2019 \u2013 Sleaze Roxx|last=Olivier|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>. Notably left off was \"Where The Wild Things Are\", a live favorite from the time, and the ballad \"Can`t Stand Loving You\".\n\nThe band broke up in April 1992 when Roxie returned to Los Angeles to become the guitarist on [[Gilby Clarke]]\u00b4s solo albums for [[Slash's Snakepit]] and later in 1996 [[Alice Cooper]]. Roxie later moved to [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. Shane, Jonathan, and John returned a few years later, sans guitarist Ryan Roxie who was replaced by Richard Tressan and with the addition of John Ceparano, as The Loveless, self-releasing ''A Tale Of Gin And Salvation'' in 1995<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/loveless-tale-2495979593.html|title=The Loveless: A Tale of Gin and Salvation|date=2002-10-07|website=PopMatters|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>.

The three song set consisted of two Daniels tunes and a Ceprarano tune.  The tunes were \"My Tattooed Angel (from punk rock heaven)\", \"Movin' On\" (Ceparano) and \"Stupid Mother****er\".  The later song title and lyric was changed to \"Stupid Futhermucker\" for demo purposes.  John \"the Hawk\" Schubert was the drummer.\n\nThe Electric Angels, again without Roxie, reunited in early 2000 for a one-off radio program appearance on [[WDHA]]'s The Tour Bus.\n\n==Discography==\nAs Electric Angels:\n*''[[Electric Angels]]'' (1990)\n*''New York Times'' (Unreleased, 1992)\n*''[[Lost in the Atlantic]]'' (2017)\n*''Home Sweet Democide (Unofficial, 2001)''\n\nAs The Loveless\n*''[[A Tale Of Gin And Salvation]]'' (1995)\n\n==Singles==\n*''Rattlesnake Kisses'' (1990)\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Hard rock musical groups from California]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1989]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=March 2013}}\n\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name                = Electric Angels\n| background          = group_or_band\n| origin              = Los Angeles, California\n| genre = [[Glam rock]], [[hard rock]]\n| associated_acts     = Candy, The Loveless\n| years_active        = 1989-1992\n| past_members        = [[Ryan Roxie]]<br>Jonathan Daniel<br>John Schubert<br>Shane (Thomas Riggins)\n}}\n\n'''Electric Angels''' was a [[Los Angeles]]-based band that formed from the defunct pop group [[Candy (band)|Candy]] featuring new singer Shane (Tommy Riggins/Shane Mansfield),<ref>http://www.bandtoband.com/band/electric-angels/s-t</ref> guitarist [[Ryan Roxie]](Ryan Rosowicz), and original Candy members bassist/songwriter Jonathan Daniel, and drummer John Schubert.

Notably left off was \"Where The Wild Things Are\", a live favorite from the time, and the ballad \"Can`t Stand Loving You\".\n\nThe band broke up in April 1992 when Roxie returned to Los Angeles to become the guitarist on [[Gilby Clarke]]\u00b4s solo albums for [[Slash's Snakepit]] and later in 1996 [[Alice Cooper]]. Roxie later moved to [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. Shane, Jonathan, and John returned a few years later, sans guitarist Ryan Roxie who was replaced by Richard Tressan and with the addition of John Ceparano, as The Loveless, self-releasing ''A Tale Of Gin And Salvation'' in 1995<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/loveless-tale-2495979593.html|title=The Loveless: A Tale of Gin and Salvation|date=2002-10-07|website=PopMatters|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>.

The three song set consisted of two Daniels tunes and a Ceprarano tune.  The tunes were \"My Tattooed Angel (from punk rock heaven)\", \"Movin' On\" (Ceparano) and \"Stupid Mother****er\".  The later song title and lyric was changed to \"Stupid Futhermucker\" for demo purposes.  John \"the Hawk\" Schubert was the drummer.\n\nThe Electric Angels, again without Roxie, reunited in early 2000 for a one-off radio program appearance on [[WDHA]]'s The Tour Bus.\n\n==Discography==\nAs Electric Angels:\n*''[[Electric Angels]]'' (1990)\n*''New York Times'' (Unreleased, 1992)\n*''[[Lost in the Atlantic]]'' (2017)\n*''Home Sweet Democide (Unofficial, 2001)''\n\nAs The Loveless\n*''[[A Tale Of Gin And Salvation]]'' (1995)\n\n==Singles==\n*''Rattlesnake Kisses'' (1990)\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Hard rock musical groups from California]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1989]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed a typo found withWikipedia:Typo_Team/mossand reduced ALLCAPS \u2013 please seeWikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Capital_letters#All_caps_and_small_capsabout reducing ALLCAPS, even in headlines and titles.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_Angels"}

Like other owl species, the great horned owl is capable of \u201csilent flight\u201d, which is the way owls fly while making almost no discernable noise, despite their large size. This is made possible thanks to three main components of the owl's wing structure. The leading edge of their feathers have serrations that help to disrupt the turbulence generated by wing flapping, then the softer feathers help deaden the sound, and finally the trailing fringe of the feathers that works to finish cutting the sounds made by flight. The structure of the great horned owl wing also allows it to fly at a very low speeds for the size of the species, as slow as 2 miles per hour when they are gliding on breezes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.audubon.org/news/the-silent-flight-owls-explained|title=The Silent Flight of Owls, Explained|date=2017-07-28|website=Audubon|language=en|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n[[File:Talons, Great Horned Owl.jpg|thumb|Great horned owl (Canada)]]\nThe legs, feet, and talons are large and powerful.

The different height holes, while still close together, are differentiated enough that the owl is able to use the timing and direction of the sound waves hitting each hole that they can use it to precisely locate prey even if located under cover like snow. The disc like shape of their faces also helps to direct the sounds they hear toward their ears.

All mated great horned owls are permanent residents of their territories, but unmated and younger birds move freely in search of company and a territory, and leave regions with little food in winter.<ref name=Konig/>\n\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Great-horned-owl-in-flight.jpg|thumb|left|Composite photo of great horned owl flight phases]]\n[[File:Bubo virginianus (Grand-duc d'Am\u00e9rique).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Great horned owls are typically sluggish and passive but aware during daytime.]]\nIn most aspects of their behavior, great horned owls are typical of owls and most birds of prey. From experimentally raising young owls in captivity, Paul L. Errington felt that they were a bird of \"essentially low intelligence\" who could only hunt when partially wild and instinctually driven by hunger to hunt whatever they first encounter. He showed captive birds that were provided strips of meat from hatching, rather than having to hunt or to simulate hunting to obtain food, had no capacity to hunt.<ref name= Errington>Errington, P.L. 1932. ''Studies on the Behavior of the Great Horned Owl''.  Wilson Bulletin, 12: 212-220.</ref> On the contrary, William J. Baerg compared his captive raised behaviorally great horned owls to [[parrot]]s, which are famously intelligent birds, although not as often playful \"it knows its keeper and usually accepts whatever he wishes to do with a good deal of tolerance\".<ref name= Baerg>Baerg, W. J. (1926). ''Trying to Tame a Great Horned Owl''. The Auk, 214-217.</ref> Arthur C. Bent also noted the variability in temperaments of great horned owls to their handlers, some generally pleasant, though most are eventually aggressive.<ref name= Bent/> Most captive specimens, once mature, seem to resent attempts at contact and are often given to attacking their keepers. They will only follow cues when conditioned from an early age but rarely with the same level of success seen in some diurnal birds of prey trained for [[falconry]] or entertainment, although this does not necessarily correlate with intelligence as posited by Errington.<ref name= Errington/><ref name= Baerg/> Carl D. Marti also disagrees with Errington's assessments, noting that their prey selection is not as \"completely random as Errington suggested\"; while \"Great Horned Owls appeared to select their mammalian prey in general relation to the prey populations...[[Cottontail rabbit|Cottontail]]s, appeared to be selected as prey out of relation to their population status.\"<ref name= Marti/>\n\nLike most owls, the great horned owl makes great use of secrecy and stealth. Due to its natural-colored plumage, it is well camouflaged both while active at night and while roosting during the day. During the daytime it roosts usually in large trees (including snags & large hollows but usually thick branches) but may occasionally be in crevices or small caves in rocks or in dense shrubbery. [[Pine]] and other [[Pinophyta|coniferous trees]] may be preferred where available since they are particularly dense and provide cover throughout the year. Typically, males have a favorite roosting site not far from the nest, sometimes used over successive years.<ref name= Austing/> While roosting, great horned owls may rest in the \"tall-thin\" position, where they sit as erect and hold themselves as slim as is possible. The kind of posture is well known as a further method of camouflage for other owls, like long-eared owls or great grey owls, especially if humans or other potential mammalian carnivores approach them. The Eurasian eagle owl rarely, if ever, assumes the tall-thin position.<ref name= Hume>Hume, R. (1991). ''Owls of the world''. Running Press, Philadelphia, PA. 1991.</ref> Outside of the nesting season, great horned owls may roost wherever their foraging path ends at dawn.<ref name= Rohner/> Generally great horned owls are active at night, although in some areas may be active in the late afternoon or early morning. At dusk, the owl utters a few calls before flying to a more open sing-post, i.e. large bare branch or large rocks to deliver song. Normally several perches are used to mark occupied territory or to attract a female.<ref name= Konig/> Despite its camouflage and cryptic locations, this species can still sometimes be spotted on its daytime roosts, especially by [[American crow]]s (''Corvus brachyrhynchos''). Since owls are, next to [[red-tailed hawk]]s, perhaps the main predator of crows and their young, crows sometimes congregate from considerable distances to mob owls and caw angrily at them for hours on end. When the owls try to fly off to avoid this harassment, they are often followed by the corvids.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wesleytheowl.blogspot.ca/2010/04/crows-and-ravens-corvids-and-their-odd.html | title=Stacey O'Brien : Wesley the Owl: Crows and Ravens: The Corvids and their odd behavior| date=2010-04-13}}</ref>\n\n===Territoriality and movements===\nTypically, great horned owls are highly sedentary, often capable of utilizing a single territory throughout their mature lives.<ref>Baumgartner, F. M. 1939. ''Territory and population in the Great Horned Owl''. Auk 56:274-282.</ref> Although some species such as snowy owls, [[northern saw-whet owl]]s, [[long-eared owl|long-eared]] and short-eared owls are true migrants, most North American owls are not migratory and will generally show fidelity to a single territory year around.<ref name= Voous/> In great horned owls, mated pairs occupy territories year-round and long-term. Territories are established and maintained through hooting, with highest activity before egg-laying and second peak in autumn when juveniles disperse, and can range from an average of {{convert|16 |km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Yukon]] to an average of {{convert|2.1 |km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Wyoming]].<ref name= Craighead/><ref name= Rohner/>\n\nMost territorial defense is performed by males, but females frequently assist their partners in hooting contests with neighbors or intruders, even during incubation.<ref name= Houston/> On occasion, although territory borders may be successfully maintained via vocalizations alone without even seeing the competing owl, such confrontations may turn physical, with various levels of threats distinguished. The highest threat level involves the spreading of wings, bill-clapping, hissing, higher-pitched screams of longer duration, with general body poised to strike with its feet at intruder. If the intruder continues to press the confrontation, the defending owl will \"hop\" forward and strike it with feet, attempting to grasp and rake with claws.<ref name= Houston/>\n\nTerritoriality appears to place a limit on the number of breeding pairs in a given area. Individuals prevented from establishing a territory live a silent existence as \"floaters\". Radio-telemetry revealed that such floaters concentrate along boundaries of established territories. At [[Kluane]]  in [[Yukon]], incursions into neighboring territories were observed only twice\u2014by females when neighboring female had died or emigrated, suggesting that territorial defense may be sex specific. At least four dead great horned owls in Kluane were apparently killed by others of their own species in territorial conflicts.<ref name= Rohner/> Owls killed by other horned owls are sometimes cannibalized, although the origin of the killing may have been territorial aggression.<ref>Millard, J.

During hunting forays, they often fly about {{convert|50|to|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} from perch to perch, stopping to survey for food at each, until they sense a prey item below. From such vantage points, owls dive down to the ground, often with wings folded, to ambush their prey.<ref name=Konig/> Effective maximum hunting distance of an owl from an elevated perch is {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name= Petersen/> Due to their short but broad wings, great horned owls are ideally suited for low speed and maneuverability.<ref name= Johnson/> Despite reports that they do not hunt on the wing,<ref name= Rudolph>Rudolph, S.

''Hunting methods and success of newly-fledged Great Horned Owls''.

They have been known to wade into shallow water for aquatic prey, although this has been only rarely reported.<ref name= Houston/> Owls can snatch [[bird]]s and some arboreal mammals directly from tree branches in a glide as well. The stiff feathering of their wings allows owls to produce minimal sound in flight while hunting.<ref name=Cornell/><ref name=Konig/><ref name=\"owlpages.com\"/>\n\nAlmost all prey are killed by crushing with the owl's feet or by incidentally stabbing of the talons, though some may be bitten about the face as well. Prey is swallowed whole when possible. When prey is swallowed whole, owls regurgitate [[Pellet (ornithology)|pellets]] of bone and other non-digestible bits about 6 to 10 hours later, usually in the same location where the prey was consumed.<ref name=Konig/> Great horned owl pellets are dark gray or brown in color and very large, {{convert|7.6|to|10.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and have been known to contain skulls up to {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width inside them.<ref name=\"owlpages.com\"/> However, not all prey can be swallowed at once, and owls will also fly with prey to a perch and tear off pieces with their bill. Most dietary studies focus on pellets found under perches and around nests, since they provide a more complete picture of the diversity of prey consumed, but prey remains outside of pellets may provide clues to prey excluded from the pellets and a combination of both is recommended.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Hamerstrom/><ref name= Orians>Orians, G., & Kuhlman, F. (1956). ''Red-tailed hawk and horned owl populations in Wisconsin''. Condor, 371-385.</ref> Many large prey items are dismembered. Great horned owls may behead large prey before taking it to its nest or eating perch. The legs may also be removed, as may (in some bird prey) the wings. The great horned owl will also crush the bones of its prey to make it more compact for carrying.<ref>Einarsen, A. S. 1956. ''Determination of some predator species by food signs''. Oregon State Monographs, 10: 34.</ref> On occasion, the owls may return to the kill site to continue eating if the prey is too heavy to fly with after dismemberment.<ref name= Bent/> Many owls will accrue a cache of prey, especially those who are nesting. Caches must be at a safe location, usually the crotch of a tall tree. In northern regions, where large prey is prevalent, an owl may let uneaten food freeze and then thaw it out later using its own body heat.<ref name= Mikkola/>  Hunting success seems to require fairly open understory, and experimental testing of microhabitat proved that open areas provided more hunting success on five species of rodent, with cloudy nights and denser bush foliage both decreasing success.<ref>Longland, W.

Weighing a mere {{convert|14|to|31.5|g|oz|abbr=on}} and {{convert|20|to|58|g|oz|abbr=on}} on average, the nine species of New World mice in ''Peromyscus'' and eight species voles in ''Microtus'' recorded in the diet would appear to be overly small to be as important as they are to a predatory bird of this size. The prominence of these genera is undoubtedly due to the abundance of both genera in the wooded edge habitats frequented by great horned owls. It is estimated that a family of owls with two offspring would need to take about a half dozen (voles) to a dozen (mice) of these rodents every night to satisfy their dietary requirements but apparently the accessibility and abundance of these foods is irresistible as their numeric dominance is indisputable.<ref name= Craighead/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> By winter in areas that hold heavy snow, ''[[Peromyscus]]'' mice often come to outnumber the voles in the diet since the mice tend to travel over the surface of the snow while the voles make tunnels underneath the snow.<ref name= Craighead/><ref name= Voous/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> In fact, a healthy family of great horned owls can decimate a colony of field rats, thus potentially performing a key role in controlling a highly destructive pest.<ref name= Hamerstrom/>  Great horned owls living in the timbered fringes of garbage or refuse dumps may subsist mostly on rats.<ref name= Mikkola/>\n\nIn the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], California, the [[Southwestern United States]] and northern [[Mexico]], the diversity of this species' diet rises, in sync with the diversity of rodents.

The predatory effect of this species on other raptorial birds, which is often considerable, is explored in the following section. In [[Brazil]], it was found in a small study that birds overall outnumbered mammals in pellets, although most were not determined to species and the ones that were shown a tremendously diverse assemblage of birds with no obvious dietary preference.<ref name= Tomazzoni/> Although not usually numerically significant, 86 species of [[passerine]] have been taken by great horned owls. Members from most North American families are known as prey, although among smaller types such as [[chickadee]]s, [[New World warbler|warbler]]s, [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s, [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinals]], [[wren]]s and most [[tyrant flycatcher]]s only a few species from each have been recorded.

However, [[lizard]]s are largely unavailable as prey due to their typically diurnal periods of activity.<ref name= Houston/> However, some snakes are partially or largely nocturnal, and more than a dozen species are hunted in North America. Snakes hunted range from small, innocuous [[garter snake]]s (''Thamnophis'' ssp.) and [[night snake]]s (''Hypsiglena torquata'') to venomous species like [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|cottonmouth]]s (''Agkistrodon piscivorus'') and [[Crotalus viridis|prairie rattlesnake]]s (''Crotalus virdis'') and formidable, large species like [[Lampropeltis getula|common king snake]]s (''Lampropeltis getula'') and [[Western rat snake|black rat snake]]s (''Pantherophis obsoletus''), which in mature specimens can rival the owl in mass and sheer predatory power.<ref name= Bent/> The capture of the hatchlings of very large reptiles such as [[loggerhead turtle]]s (''Caretta caretta'') and [[American alligator]]s (''Alligator mississippiensis'') by great horned owls has been reported, in both cases likely when the baby reptiles are attempting to make their way to the security of water.<ref name= Bent/><ref>Toland, B. (1991). ''Great horned owl predation of Atlantic loggerhead turtle hatchlings''.

The occasionally invertebrate prey taken largely consists of common, large insects such as various [[beetle]]s, [[crickets]], [[grasshopper]]s, [[Nepomorpha|water bug]]s and [[Tettigoniidae|katydid]]s, some of which the great horned owl has even reportedly caught via \"hawking\", i.e. swooping at on the wing.<ref name= Bent/><ref name= Houston/><ref>Duncan, J.R. & Lane, P.A. 1998.

Almost every study comparing the diets of North American owls illustrates the considerable overlap in the dietary selection of these species, as all species, besides the primarily insectivorous varieties, rely on many of the same small rodent species for most of their diet, extending from the small northern saw-whet owl and [[eastern screech owl]] to the great horned and great grey owls.<ref name= Marti/><ref name= Cromrich/>\n\nIn a long-term study of a block of [[Michigan]], all nine species of accipitrid, falcon and owl that stayed to breed there were found to be primarily dependent on the same two rodent genera, the [[meadow vole]] and the two common ''[[Peromyscus]]'' species.<ref name= Craighead/> In the [[Great Basin]], the owls share black-tailed jackrabbit and [[desert cottontail]] as the primary prey with golden eagles, red-tailed hawks and [[ferruginous hawk]]s (''Buteo regalis''); all four species had diets with more than 90% of the biomass is made up of those lagomorphs. Of these, the great horned owl and golden eagle were able to nest most closely to one another because they had the most strongly dissimilar periods of activity.<ref name= Smith/><ref name= Smith3/> In California, when compared to the local red-tailed hawks and [[Crotalus atrox|western diamondback rattlesnake]]s (''Crotalus atrox''), the diets were most similar in that by number about 15-20% of all three species' diets depended on [[Cottontail rabbit|cottontail]]s, but the largest portion was made up of [[ground squirrel]]s in the hawk and the rattlesnake and desert woodrats and other assorted [[rodent]]s in the great horned owl.<ref name= Fitch/> In the [[Taiga|boreal forests]], the great horned owl's prolificacy as a [[snowshoe hare]] hunter places it second only to the [[Canada lynx]] (''Lynx canadensis'') among all predators. Although locally dependent on the hares as their main food, [[northern goshawk]]s (''Accipiter gentilis''), red-tailed hawks and golden eagles apparently do not have as large of an impact on the hares, nor do mammalian carnivore generalists that also kill many hares, like the [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]], [[bobcat]], [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo''), [[coyote]] and larger varieties (i.e. [[Gray wolf|wolves]] (''Canis lupus''), [[cougar]]s (''Puma concolor'') and [[bear]]s (''Ursus'' ssp.)).<ref name= Rohner/><ref name= Houston2/><ref name= Mcinvaille/><ref>WLM. (1918). ''Bird Enemies of the Varying Hare''. The Auk, 372-373.</ref>\n\nThe relationship between great horned owls and other raptorial birds in its range is usually decidedly one-sided. While certain species, such as the red-tailed hawk and [[northern goshawk]], might be seen as potential competition for the owls, most others seem to be regarded merely as prey by great horned owls. The great horned owl is both the most prolific and diverse predator in America of other birds of prey, with other accomplished raptor-hunters such as the goshawk and the golden eagle being more restricted in range, habitat and number in North America and thus having a more minor impact. All studies have found raptors are a small portion of this owl's diet but predation can be seriously detrimental for such prey, as raptors tend to be territorial and sparsely distributed as a rule and thus can be effectively decimated by a small number of losses.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Cromrich/> In the [[gray hawk]] (''Buteo plagiatus''), for example, in a study of one breeding block of [[Arizona]], the owls were observed to visit nests nightly until all the nestlings were gone.<ref>Bibles, Brent D., Richard L. Glinski and R. Roy Johnson. 2002. ''Gray Hawk (Buteo plagiatus)'', The Birds of North America Online (A. Poole, Ed.). Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology.</ref>\n\nRaptorial birds in general tend to have large, conspicuous nests which may make them easier for a hunting owl to locate. The great horned owl gains an advantage by nesting earlier than any other raptor in its range (indeed any bird), as it is able to exploit the other raptors as food while in a more vulnerable state as their own nestlings have become well developed.<ref name= Craighead/> On average, great horned owls begin nesting about three weeks before red-tailed hawks begin to build nests, although some raptors may locally breed as much as two months after the owls.<ref name= Houston/><ref name= Dunstan>Dunstan, T. C., & Harrell, B. E. (1973). ''Spatio-temporal relationships between breeding red-tailed hawks and great horned owls in South Dakota''. Raptor Research, 7(2), 49\u201354.</ref>\n\nMore so than diurnal varieties of raptor, fairly significant numbers of owls are hunted, as all species are to some extent nocturnal and thus their corresponding activity can attract the horned owl's unwanted attention. The extent of predation on other owls depends on the habitat preferences of the other species. Eastern and western screech owls may be most vulnerable since they prefer similar wooded edge habitat. In a block of [[Wisconsin]], great horned owls were responsible for the failure of 78% of eastern screech owl's nests.<ref name= Craighead/> Long-eared owls and, to a lesser extent, barn owls tend to hunt in open, sparsely treed habitats more so than great horned owls, but since they may return to wooded spots for nesting purposes, they may be more vulnerable there. The long-eared owl and barn owls are often compared to the great horned owl as these medium-sized species often occur in abutting habitats and often hunt primarily the same vole and mice species, although the alternate prey of the great horned tends to be much larger, including the smaller owls themselves.<ref name= Earhart/><ref name= Rudolph/><ref>Barrows, C.

In the boreal forests, both the northern hawk owl and great grey owl appear to be in greater danger of great horned owl predation in years where the snowshoe hare have low populations.<ref name= Duncan>Duncan, J.

Anecdotally, both snowy and great horned owls have rarely been reported to dominate or even kill one another depending on the size and disposition of the individual owls, although the snowy's preference for more open areas again acts as something of a buffer. The snowy may be the one North American owl too formidable for the great horned owl to consider as prey.<ref name= Potapov/>\n\nWhereas owls of any age are freely attacked by great horned owls whether nesting or not, when it comes to diurnal raptors, great horned owls are mainly a danger around the nest. They often hunt diurnal raptors when they come across their often relatively conspicuous active platform nests during hunting forays in spring and summer, taking numbers of both nestlings and brooding adults.<ref name= Houston/> Again, like owls, diurnal raptors are attacked depending on the relative similarity of their habitat preferences to the owl. [[Cooper's hawk]]s (''Accipiter cooperii'') and red-tailed hawks tend to be most vulnerable, as they prefer the same wooded edges frequented by great horned owls. Other diurnal raptors may be attracted to more enclosed wooded areas, such as [[sharp-shinned hawk]]s (''Accipiter striatus'') or [[zone-tailed hawk]]s (''Buteo albonotatus''), or more open plain and meadow areas, such as [[Northern harrier]]s (''Circus hudsonius'') and ferruginous hawks, but this is almost never a total insurance against predation as all of these are recorded prey.<ref name= Hamerstrom/><ref>Stoleson, S.

In most of North America, courtship is from October to December and mates are chosen by December to January.<ref name=Konig/> This species was once thought to be strictly monogamous, but recent analysis indicates one male may mate with two females simultaneously, as was discovered for the first time in 2018 in Reno, Nevada.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/animals-owls-birds-parenting-polygamy/#close | title=These Owl Chicks Have Two Moms and a Dad\u2014a First| date=2018-05-02}}</ref> During courtship in late fall or early winter, the male attracts the attention of his mate by hooting emphatically while leaning over (with the tail folded or cocked) and puffing up his white throat to look like a ball.<ref name= Konig/> The white throat may serve as a visual stimuli in the low light conditions typical of when this owl courts.<ref name= Rohner/> He often flies up and down on a perch, while approaching the potential mate. Eventually, he comes to approach the female and tries to rub his bill against hers while repeatedly bowing. If receptive, the female hoots back when the pair meet but is more subdued in both her hoot and display. The male may convince the female by bringing her freshly caught prey, which they will share.<ref name=Bent/><ref name= Konig/> While males often hoot emphatically for about a month or six weeks towards the end of the year, the period where females also hoot is usually only a week to ten days.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Pairs typically breed together year after year and may mate for life, although they associate with each other more loosely when their young become mostly independent.<ref name= Konig/> Pairs rekindling their reproductive relationship in the winter may perform a milder courtship to strengthen pair bonds before producing young.<ref name= Baumgartner/>\n\nMales select nesting sites and bring the females' attention to them by flying to them and then stomping on them.<ref name=Konig/> Nests with open access, considering this birds large size, as opposed to enclosed with surrounding branches, are preferred. Like all owls, great horned owls do not build their own nest. Great horned owls tend to examine an area for an abandoned nest, generally from larger birds like hawks, and take over the nest for raising their own young.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morse|first=Douglass H.|date=April 1971|title=Great Horned Owls and Nesting Seabirds|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4083889|journal=The Auk|volume=88|issue=2|pages=426\u2013427|doi=10.2307/4083889|issn=0004-8038}}</ref> They nest in a wider variety of nest sites than any other North American bird.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Many nests are in cavernous hollows of dead trees or their branches, especially in southern states in large trees along the edge of old-growth lots.<ref name= Baumgartner/> In mountainous or hilly areas, especially in canyons of the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]] and [[Rocky Mountains]], cliff ledges, small caves, and other sheltered depressions may be used.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Owls living in prairie country, in the absence of other animals' nests, riparian trees or non-native trees or the bare ground of tree hollows or man-made structures, will use boulders, buttes, railroad cuts, low bushes and even the bare ground as nest sites.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Ground nests have also been recorded in the midst of tall grasses in [[Florida]] and in the midsts of brushy spots on the desert ground.<ref name= Voous/> Even the burrow entrances of [[American badger]] and [[coyote]] dens have reportedly been used as nests, in spite of the inherent risk of sharing space with such potentially dangerous co-inhabitants.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Nesting behavior for the great horned owl appears to be more closely related to prey availability than it does to seasonal conditions.

Gradually the soft juvenal downy plumage comes through the down, being typically a cinnamon-buff color, but with variable hues predicting the eventual color of the mature owls. The extent of down gradually diminishes, developing mature-looking plumage by late summer, although many first year birds still have scattered bits of down into autumn. By late autumn, first-year birds look similar to adults but with a slightly warmer, reddish tinge, less well developed ear tufts and a smaller white throat patch.<ref name= Bent/> The nestling owls develop mostly in behavior between two weeks and two months of age, in which time they adapt the ability to defend themselves, grasp foods and climb. Vocally, the young are able to exert weak chips while still in the egg, developing into a raspy chirp shortly after hatching. The calls of the young increase rapidly in intensity, pitch and character, some juvenile males mimicking their father's hooting in fall but usually they conclude with various odd gurgling notes. The earliest competent hooting by juvenile owls is not until January.<ref name= Houston/><ref>Sumner, Jr., E. L. 1934. ''The behavior of some young raptorial birds''.

Occasionally, nestlings and fledglings will fall from the nest too early to escape or to competently defend themselves and fall prey to [[fox]]es, [[bobcat]], [[coyote]]s, or wild or feral [[cat]]s. Occasionally [[raccoon]]s and [[American black bear]]s consume eggs and nestlings from tree nests and [[Virginia opossum]] may take the rare unguarded egg.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Houston/> [[Crow]]s and [[raven]]s have been reported eating eggs and small nestlings. This can normally only happen when owls are driven from the nest by human activity or are forced to leave the nest to forage by low food resources but on occasion huge flocks of crows have been able to displace owls by harassing them endlessly.<ref name= Bent/><ref name= Houston/> In general, great horned owls rarely engage in [[siblicide]], unlike many other raptorial birds. Siblicide occurred at 9 of 2,711 nests in [[Saskatchewan]].<ref name= Houston2/> Most cases where young owls are killed and/or consumed by their siblings or parents appear to occur when the nestling is diseased, impaired or starving or is inadvertently crushed.<ref name= Hamerstrom/> Adults generally have no natural predators, excepting both North American [[eagle]]s and other owls of their own species.<ref name= Bent/>\n\nOccasionally, great horned owls may be killed by their own prey. Although typically able to kill skunks without ill effect, five owls were found blind after getting sprayed in their eyes by skunks.<ref>Garcelon, D. K. 1981. ''Mortality of Great Horned Owls associated with skunks''. Murrelet 62:26.</ref> Cases where the quills of porcupines have killed or functionally disabled them have been observed as well.<ref name= Powell/> Violent fights have been observed between great horned owls after attempts to capture [[Western rat snake|rat snake]]s and [[Coluber constrictor|black racers]].<ref name= Bent/><ref>Peterson, R.

A. (1969). ''Movements, population fluctuations, and mortality among great horned owls''. The Wilson Bulletin, 155-162.</ref> Among 209 banded nestlings in yet another study, 67% were found dead after independence: 56 were found shot, 41 were trapped, 15 hit by cars, 14 found dead on highways and 14 electrocuted by overhead power lines.<ref>Olendorff, R.

The first genuine nature conservationists, while campaigning against the \"Extermination Being Waged Against the Hawks and Owls\", continued to advocate the destruction of great horned owls due to their predatory effect on other wildlife.<ref name= Voous/> Thus, small bounties were offered in trade for owl bodies. Around the turn of the 20th century, the great horned owl was considered endangered in the state of [[Michigan]] because of a large quantity of poachers who were illegally hunting and collecting it.<ref>Barrows, W. B. 1912. \"Michigan bird life\". Michigan Agricultural College, Lansing.</ref> Hunting and trapping of great horned owls may continue on a small scale but is now illegal in most countries.\n\n===Effect on conservation-dependent species===\nOccasionally, these owls may prey on threatened species. Following the devastation to its populations from [[DDT]], the reintroduction of the [[peregrine falcon]] to the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Hudson River]]s was hampered by great horned owls killing both young and adult peregrines at night.<ref>Cade, T. J., P. T. Redig, and H. B. Tordoff. 1989. ''Peregrine Falcon restoration: Expectation vs. reality''. Loon 61:160-162.</ref> Similarly, as mainly recorded in [[New England]], attempts to reintroduce [[osprey]]s, after they were also hit hard by DDT, were affected by heavy owl predation on nestlings, and the owls were also recorded to take a large toll locally on the threatened colonies of [[roseate tern]]s.<ref name= Houston/> Where clear-cutting occurs in old-growth areas of the [[Pacific Northwest]], spotted owls have been badly affected by considerable great horned owl predation.<ref name= Johnson2/><ref>Forsman, E.

The [[Arikara]] of the [[Great Plains]] had mystic owl societies in which initiates were made to adorn facial mask made of the wing and tail feathers of great horned owls. Some Indian nations regarded the great horned owl as a friendly spirit who could aid in matters of love, such as the [[Passamaquoddy]] of [[Maine]] who felt the call of this species was a magical love flute designed to ignite human passions. The [[Hopi]] of the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]] also associated this owl with fertility, albeit of a different kind: they believed the calling of the owls into summer predicted hot weather, which produced good peach crops. During the [[winter solstice]], the Hopi performed a ceremony with great horned owl feathers in hopes of summoning the heat of summer. Tribes in [[New Mexico]] were known to use owl wing feathers to produce arrows which could strike their enemies with a minimum of sound. The [[Zuni people|Zuni]] held owl feathers in their mouths hoping to gain some of the silence that owls use in ambushes while striking their own enemies from other tribes. The [[Iroquois]] felt the origin of the great horned owl was due to an unformed owl annoying [[Iroquois mythology|Raweno]], the almighty creator, while Raweno created the [[rabbit]], causing Raweno to make the owl \"covered with mud\" (dark camouflage) and doomed to ceaselessly call \"whoo whoo\", which he used while harassing Raweno, by night because Raweno was active during the day.<ref name=DwightSmith/>\n\n===Provincial bird===\n\nThe great horned owl is the [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial bird]] of [[Alberta]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus)|url=http://aep.alberta.ca/fish-wildlife/wild-species/birds/owls/great-horned-owl.aspx|website=Alberta Environment & Parks}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Accordi|first=Iury Almeida|author2=Barcellos, Andre|title=Composi\u00e7\u00e3o da avifauna em oito \u00e1reas \u00famidas da Bacia Hidrogr\u00e1fica do Lago Gua\u00edba, Rio Grande do Sul|journal=Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia|date=June 2006|volume=14|issue=2|pages=101\u2013115|url=http://www.ararajuba.org.br/sbo/ararajuba/artigos/Volume142/ara142art2.pdf|language=Portuguese, English|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219192057/http://www.ararajuba.org.br/sbo/ararajuba/artigos/Volume142/ara142art2.pdf|archivedate=2008-12-19}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Banks|first=R.C. |author2=Cicero, C. |author3=Dunn, J.L. |author4=Kratter, A.W. |author5=Ouellet, H. |author6=Rasmussen, P.C. |author7=Remsen, J.V.

The white throat may continue as a streak running down the middle of the breast even when the birds are not displaying, which in particularly pale individuals can widen at the belly into a large white area. [[South American great horned owl]]s typically have a smaller white throat patch, often unseen unless actively displaying, and rarely display the white area on the chest.<ref name= Voous/> Individual and regional variations in overall color occur, with birds from the [[subarctic]] showing a washed-out, light-buff color, while those from the [[Pacific Coast]] of North America, Central America, and much of South America can be a dark brownish color overlaid with blackish blotching. The skin of the feet and legs, though almost entirely obscured by feathers, is black. Even tropical great horned owls have feathered legs and feet.

Like other owl species, the great horned owl is capable of \u201csilent flight\u201d, which is the way owls fly while making almost no discernable noise, despite their large size. This is made possible thanks to three main components of the owl's wing structure. The leading edge of their feathers have serrations that help to disrupt the turbulence generated by wing flapping, then the softer feathers help deaden the sound, and finally the trailing fringe of the feathers that works to finish cutting the sounds made by flight. The structure of the great horned owl wing also allows it to fly at a very low speeds for the size of the species, as slow as 2 miles per hour when they are gliding on breezes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.audubon.org/news/the-silent-flight-owls-explained|title=The Silent Flight of Owls, Explained|date=2017-07-28|website=Audubon|language=en|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n[[File:Talons, Great Horned Owl.jpg|thumb|Great horned owl (Canada)]]\nThe legs, feet, and talons are large and powerful.

The different height holes, while still close together, are differentiated enough that the owl is able to use the timing and direction of the sound waves hitting each hole that they can use it to precisely locate prey even if located under cover like snow. The disc like shape of their faces also helps to direct the sounds they hear toward their ears. While the true nature/purpose of the ear tufts that are present on the great horned owl are unknown, researchers agree that the tufts do not play any role in the hearing ability of the owl. It is estimated that their hearing is up to ten times that of a human being.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Traynor|first=Robert M.|date=September 1997|title=The missing link for success in hearing aid fittings|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00025572-199709000-00001|journal=The Hearing Journal|volume=50|issue=9|pages=10|doi=10.1097/00025572-199709000-00001|issn=0745-7472}}</ref>\n\nThe great horned owl's eyes, just slightly smaller than the eyes of a [[human being]], are large even for an owl and rank proportionately among the largest eyes of all terrestrial vertebrates.<ref>Hall, M.

From experimentally raising young owls in captivity, Paul L. Errington felt that they were a bird of \"essentially low intelligence\" who could only hunt when partially wild and instinctually driven by hunger to hunt whatever they first encounter. He showed captive birds that were provided strips of meat from hatching, rather than having to hunt or to simulate hunting to obtain food, had no capacity to hunt.<ref name= Errington>Errington, P.L. 1932. ''Studies on the Behavior of the Great Horned Owl''.  Wilson Bulletin, 12: 212-220.</ref> On the contrary, William J. Baerg compared his captive raised behaviorally great horned owls to [[parrot]]s, which are famously intelligent birds, although not as often playful \"it knows its keeper and usually accepts whatever he wishes to do with a good deal of tolerance\".<ref name= Baerg>Baerg, W. J. (1926). ''Trying to Tame a Great Horned Owl''. The Auk, 214-217.</ref> Arthur C. Bent also noted the variability in temperaments of great horned owls to their handlers, some generally pleasant, though most are eventually aggressive.<ref name= Bent/> Most captive specimens, once mature, seem to resent attempts at contact and are often given to attacking their keepers. They will only follow cues when conditioned from an early age but rarely with the same level of success seen in some diurnal birds of prey trained for [[falconry]] or entertainment, although this does not necessarily correlate with intelligence as posited by Errington.<ref name= Errington/><ref name= Baerg/> Carl D. Marti also disagrees with Errington's assessments, noting that their prey selection is not as \"completely random as Errington suggested\"; while \"Great Horned Owls appeared to select their mammalian prey in general relation to the prey populations...[[Cottontail rabbit|Cottontail]]s, appeared to be selected as prey out of relation to their population status.\"<ref name= Marti/>\n\nLike most owls, the great horned owl makes great use of secrecy and stealth. Due to its natural-colored plumage, it is well camouflaged both while active at night and while roosting during the day. During the daytime it roosts usually in large trees (including snags & large hollows but usually thick branches) but may occasionally be in crevices or small caves in rocks or in dense shrubbery. [[Pine]] and other [[Pinophyta|coniferous trees]] may be preferred where available since they are particularly dense and provide cover throughout the year. Typically, males have a favorite roosting site not far from the nest, sometimes used over successive years.<ref name= Austing/> While roosting, great horned owls may rest in the \"tall-thin\" position, where they sit as erect and hold themselves as slim as is possible. The kind of posture is well known as a further method of camouflage for other owls, like long-eared owls or great grey owls, especially if humans or other potential mammalian carnivores approach them. The Eurasian eagle owl rarely, if ever, assumes the tall-thin position.<ref name= Hume>Hume, R. (1991). ''Owls of the world''. Running Press, Philadelphia, PA. 1991.</ref> Outside of the nesting season, great horned owls may roost wherever their foraging path ends at dawn.<ref name= Rohner/> Generally great horned owls are active at night, although in some areas may be active in the late afternoon or early morning. At dusk, the owl utters a few calls before flying to a more open sing-post, i.e. large bare branch or large rocks to deliver song. Normally several perches are used to mark occupied territory or to attract a female.<ref name= Konig/> Despite its camouflage and cryptic locations, this species can still sometimes be spotted on its daytime roosts, especially by [[American crow]]s (''Corvus brachyrhynchos''). Since owls are, next to [[red-tailed hawk]]s, perhaps the main predator of crows and their young, crows sometimes congregate from considerable distances to mob owls and caw angrily at them for hours on end. When the owls try to fly off to avoid this harassment, they are often followed by the corvids.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wesleytheowl.blogspot.ca/2010/04/crows-and-ravens-corvids-and-their-odd.html | title=Stacey O'Brien : Wesley the Owl: Crows and Ravens: The Corvids and their odd behavior| date=2010-04-13}}</ref>\n\n===Territoriality and movements===\nTypically, great horned owls are highly sedentary, often capable of utilizing a single territory throughout their mature lives.<ref>Baumgartner, F. M. 1939. ''Territory and population in the Great Horned Owl''. Auk 56:274-282.</ref> Although some species such as snowy owls, [[northern saw-whet owl]]s, [[long-eared owl|long-eared]] and short-eared owls are true migrants, most North American owls are not migratory and will generally show fidelity to a single territory year around.<ref name= Voous/> In great horned owls, mated pairs occupy territories year-round and long-term. Territories are established and maintained through hooting, with highest activity before egg-laying and second peak in autumn when juveniles disperse, and can range from an average of {{convert|16 |km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Yukon]] to an average of {{convert|2.1 |km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in [[Wyoming]].<ref name= Craighead/><ref name= Rohner/>\n\nMost territorial defense is performed by males, but females frequently assist their partners in hooting contests with neighbors or intruders, even during incubation.<ref name= Houston/> On occasion, although territory borders may be successfully maintained via vocalizations alone without even seeing the competing owl, such confrontations may turn physical, with various levels of threats distinguished. The highest threat level involves the spreading of wings, bill-clapping, hissing, higher-pitched screams of longer duration, with general body poised to strike with its feet at intruder. If the intruder continues to press the confrontation, the defending owl will \"hop\" forward and strike it with feet, attempting to grasp and rake with claws.<ref name= Houston/>\n\nTerritoriality appears to place a limit on the number of breeding pairs in a given area. Individuals prevented from establishing a territory live a silent existence as \"floaters\". Radio-telemetry revealed that such floaters concentrate along boundaries of established territories. At [[Kluane]]  in [[Yukon]], incursions into neighboring territories were observed only twice\u2014by females when neighboring female had died or emigrated, suggesting that territorial defense may be sex specific. At least four dead great horned owls in Kluane were apparently killed by others of their own species in territorial conflicts.<ref name= Rohner/> Owls killed by other horned owls are sometimes cannibalized, although the origin of the killing may have been territorial aggression.<ref>Millard, J.

During hunting forays, they often fly about {{convert|50|to|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} from perch to perch, stopping to survey for food at each, until they sense a prey item below. From such vantage points, owls dive down to the ground, often with wings folded, to ambush their prey.<ref name=Konig/> Effective maximum hunting distance of an owl from an elevated perch is {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name= Petersen/> Due to their short but broad wings, great horned owls are ideally suited for low speed and maneuverability.<ref name= Johnson/> Despite reports that they do not hunt on the wing,<ref name= Rudolph>Rudolph, S. G. (1978). ''Predation Ecology of Coexistng Great Horned and Barn Owls''. The Wilson Bulletin, 134-137.</ref> they also sometimes hunt by flying low over openings on the ground, scanning below for prey activity.<ref name= Konig/> Great horned owls can fly at speeds of more than {{convert|65|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in level flight.<ref name= Voous/> Hunting flights are slow, often quartering low above the ground where prey is likely to occur in open country or open woodland. Brief hovering flight (for about 6\u201318 seconds) have been described, especially in windy areas.<ref>Smith, D. G. and B. A. Smith. 1972. ''Hunting methods and success of newly-fledged Great Horned Owls''. Bird-Banding 43:142.</ref> On occasion owls may actually walk on the ground in pursuit of small prey or, rarely, inside a chicken coop to prey on the fowl within.<ref name=\"owlpages.com\"/> [[Rodent]]s and [[invertebrate]]s may be caught on foot around the base of bushes, through grassy areas, and near culverts and other human structures in range and farm habitat.<ref name= Houston/> The great horned owl is generally a poor walker on the ground; it walks like a [[starling]], with a pronounced side-to-side gait. They have been known to wade into shallow water for aquatic prey, although this has been only rarely reported.<ref name= Houston/> Owls can snatch [[bird]]s and some arboreal mammals directly from tree branches in a glide as well. The stiff feathering of their wings allows owls to produce minimal sound in flight while hunting.<ref name=Cornell/><ref name=Konig/><ref name=\"owlpages.com\"/>\n\nAlmost all prey are killed by crushing with the owl's feet or by incidentally stabbing of the talons, though some may be bitten about the face as well. Prey is swallowed whole when possible. When prey is swallowed whole, owls regurgitate [[Pellet (ornithology)|pellets]] of bone and other non-digestible bits about 6 to 10 hours later, usually in the same location where the prey was consumed.<ref name=Konig/> Great horned owl pellets are dark gray or brown in color and very large, {{convert|7.6|to|10.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and have been known to contain skulls up to {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} in width inside them.<ref name=\"owlpages.com\"/> However, not all prey can be swallowed at once, and owls will also fly with prey to a perch and tear off pieces with their bill. Most dietary studies focus on pellets found under perches and around nests, since they provide a more complete picture of the diversity of prey consumed, but prey remains outside of pellets may provide clues to prey excluded from the pellets and a combination of both is recommended.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Hamerstrom/><ref name= Orians>Orians, G., & Kuhlman, F. (1956). ''Red-tailed hawk and horned owl populations in Wisconsin''. Condor, 371-385.</ref> Many large prey items are dismembered. Great horned owls may behead large prey before taking it to its nest or eating perch. The legs may also be removed, as may (in some bird prey) the wings. The great horned owl will also crush the bones of its prey to make it more compact for carrying.<ref>Einarsen, A. S. 1956. ''Determination of some predator species by food signs''. Oregon State Monographs, 10: 34.</ref> On occasion, the owls may return to the kill site to continue eating if the prey is too heavy to fly with after dismemberment.<ref name= Bent/> Many owls will accrue a cache of prey, especially those who are nesting. Caches must be at a safe location, usually the crotch of a tall tree. In northern regions, where large prey is prevalent, an owl may let uneaten food freeze and then thaw it out later using its own body heat.<ref name= Mikkola/>  Hunting success seems to require fairly open understory, and experimental testing of microhabitat proved that open areas provided more hunting success on five species of rodent, with cloudy nights and denser bush foliage both decreasing success.<ref>Longland, W.

Weighing a mere {{convert|14|to|31.5|g|oz|abbr=on}} and {{convert|20|to|58|g|oz|abbr=on}} on average, the nine species of New World mice in ''Peromyscus'' and eight species voles in ''Microtus'' recorded in the diet would appear to be overly small to be as important as they are to a predatory bird of this size. The prominence of these genera is undoubtedly due to the abundance of both genera in the wooded edge habitats frequented by great horned owls. It is estimated that a family of owls with two offspring would need to take about a half dozen (voles) to a dozen (mice) of these rodents every night to satisfy their dietary requirements but apparently the accessibility and abundance of these foods is irresistible as their numeric dominance is indisputable.<ref name= Craighead/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> By winter in areas that hold heavy snow, ''[[Peromyscus]]'' mice often come to outnumber the voles in the diet since the mice tend to travel over the surface of the snow while the voles make tunnels underneath the snow.<ref name= Craighead/><ref name= Voous/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> In fact, a healthy family of great horned owls can decimate a colony of field rats, thus potentially performing a key role in controlling a highly destructive pest.<ref name= Hamerstrom/>  Great horned owls living in the timbered fringes of garbage or refuse dumps may subsist mostly on rats.<ref name= Mikkola/>\n\nIn the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], California, the [[Southwestern United States]] and northern [[Mexico]], the diversity of this species' diet rises, in sync with the diversity of rodents. Especially important, from [[Colorado]] to [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] is the [[northern pocket gopher]] (''Thomomys talpoides''), although assorted other pocket gophers (''[[Geomys]], [[Cratogeomys]], [[Michoacan pocket gopher|Zygogeomys]], [[Pappogeomys]]'' and other ''[[Thomomys]]'' ssp.) are readily taken.

Some grouse, such as [[greater prairie chicken]] (''Tympanuchus cupido''), [[sharp-tailed grouse]] (''Tympanuchus phasianellus'') and [[greater sage-grouse]] (''Centrocercus urophasianus''),  may also been vulnerable to great horned owls while displaying conspicuously in openings on a [[Lek mating|lek]] first thing in the morning.<ref name= Hamerstrom2>Hamerstrom, F.

They have been known to predate more than 110 different species of assorted water bird.<ref name= Voous/> In prairie wetlands of [[North Dakota]], avian prey, primarily represented by [[duck]]s and the [[American coot]] (''Fulica americana'') came to represent 65% by number and 83% by biomass of the diet of the local owls, also including secondarily [[grebe]]s, smaller [[Rail (bird)|rails]] and [[Wader|shorebird]]s as well as upland-based species like [[grey partridge]] (''Perdix perdix''), [[sharp-tailed grouse]] and [[passerine]]s. 77% of the ducks in that study were juveniles, the largest duck being a male [[mallard]] (''Anas platyrhnychos'') weighing approximately {{convert|1250|g|lb|abbr=on}}, but nearly all the coots were adults.<ref name= Murphy/> On [[Protection Island (Washington)|Protection Island]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], where they are no native land mammals, [[rhinoceros auklet]]s (''Cerorhinca monocerata''), both adults and nestlings, were the most numerous prey, present in 93% of 120 pellets.<ref name= Hayward/> Species as large as adult [[Canada goose|Canada geese]], [[snow goose]]<ref name= Bent/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> and [[great blue heron]]s<ref name= Houston/> have been successfully killed.

The predatory effect of this species on other raptorial birds, which is often considerable, is explored in the following section. In [[Brazil]], it was found in a small study that birds overall outnumbered mammals in pellets, although most were not determined to species and the ones that were shown a tremendously diverse assemblage of birds with no obvious dietary preference.<ref name= Tomazzoni/> Although not usually numerically significant, 86 species of [[passerine]] have been taken by great horned owls. Members from most North American families are known as prey, although among smaller types such as [[chickadee]]s, [[New World warbler|warbler]]s, [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]s, [[Cardinal (bird)|cardinals]], [[wren]]s and most [[tyrant flycatcher]]s only a few species from each have been recorded. Nonetheless, an occasionally unlucky migrant or local breeder is sometimes snatched.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Bent/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> Fledgling songbirds are regularly taken in spring and summer.<ref name=DwightSmith/> The smallest avian prey known for great horned owls are the {{convert|5.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} [[blue-grey gnatcatcher]] (''Polioptila caerulea'') and the {{convert|6.2|g|oz|abbr=on}} [[ruby-crowned kinglet]] (''Regulus calendula'').<ref name= Hamerstrom/> Somewhat larger bodied families are more prominent, i.e. the [[corvid]]s (14 species) and [[icterid]]s (14 species) and, secondarily, the [[kingbird]]s (''Tyrannus'' ssp.), [[Thrush (bird)|thrushes]], [[mimid]]s and [[European starling]] (''Sturnus vulgaris'').<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Bent/><ref name= Hamerstrom/> This is likely due to the fact that the larger passerines usually roost in relatively open spots and have larger, more conspicuous nests. [[Crow]]s and [[raven]]s tend to be grabbed off of their communal roosts by night.<ref name= Houston/>\n\n===Other prey===\nThe great horned owl rarely misses an opportunity to hunt [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s. However, [[lizard]]s are largely unavailable as prey due to their typically diurnal periods of activity.<ref name= Houston/> However, some snakes are partially or largely nocturnal, and more than a dozen species are hunted in North America. Snakes hunted range from small, innocuous [[garter snake]]s (''Thamnophis'' ssp.) and [[night snake]]s (''Hypsiglena torquata'') to venomous species like [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|cottonmouth]]s (''Agkistrodon piscivorus'') and [[Crotalus viridis|prairie rattlesnake]]s (''Crotalus virdis'') and formidable, large species like [[Lampropeltis getula|common king snake]]s (''Lampropeltis getula'') and [[Western rat snake|black rat snake]]s (''Pantherophis obsoletus''), which in mature specimens can rival the owl in mass and sheer predatory power.<ref name= Bent/> The capture of the hatchlings of very large reptiles such as [[loggerhead turtle]]s (''Caretta caretta'') and [[American alligator]]s (''Alligator mississippiensis'') by great horned owls has been reported, in both cases likely when the baby reptiles are attempting to make their way to the security of water.<ref name= Bent/><ref>Toland, B. (1991). ''Great horned owl predation of Atlantic loggerhead turtle hatchlings''. Florida Field Naturalist 19, 117-119.</ref> On rare occasion, [[salamander]]s, [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s are reported as prey.  On rare occasions, fish are taken including [[goldfish]] (''Carassius auratus''), [[bluegill]] (''Lepomis macrochirus''), [[Ameiurus|bullhead]]s (''Ameiurus'' ssp.), other [[catfish]], [[Catostomidae|suckers]], [[Centrarchidae|sunfish]], [[eel]]s and [[Cyprinidae|dace and chub]].<ref name= Bent/><ref name=DwightSmith/> Many types of invertebrates are recorded as prey. These include mainly insects, but also [[crayfish]], [[crab]]s, [[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s and [[worm]]s. The occasionally invertebrate prey taken largely consists of common, large insects such as various [[beetle]]s, [[crickets]], [[grasshopper]]s, [[Nepomorpha|water bug]]s and [[Tettigoniidae|katydid]]s, some of which the great horned owl has even reportedly caught via \"hawking\", i.e. swooping at on the wing.<ref name= Bent/><ref name= Houston/><ref>Duncan, J.R. & Lane, P.A. 1998. ''Great Horned Owl Observed Hawking \"Insects\"''.

It is clearly inefficient for owls of this size to attempt to raise young on a diet of foods as small as insects.<ref name= Marti/> Although rare, [[carrion]]-feeding has been recorded in great horned owls, especially ones wintering in Canada and other northern areas during harsh weather.<ref>Errington, P.

Almost every study comparing the diets of North American owls illustrates the considerable overlap in the dietary selection of these species, as all species, besides the primarily insectivorous varieties, rely on many of the same small rodent species for most of their diet, extending from the small northern saw-whet owl and [[eastern screech owl]] to the great horned and great grey owls.<ref name= Marti/><ref name= Cromrich/>\n\nIn a long-term study of a block of [[Michigan]], all nine species of accipitrid, falcon and owl that stayed to breed there were found to be primarily dependent on the same two rodent genera, the [[meadow vole]] and the two common ''[[Peromyscus]]'' species.<ref name= Craighead/> In the [[Great Basin]], the owls share black-tailed jackrabbit and [[desert cottontail]] as the primary prey with golden eagles, red-tailed hawks and [[ferruginous hawk]]s (''Buteo regalis''); all four species had diets with more than 90% of the biomass is made up of those lagomorphs. Of these, the great horned owl and golden eagle were able to nest most closely to one another because they had the most strongly dissimilar periods of activity.<ref name= Smith/><ref name= Smith3/> In California, when compared to the local red-tailed hawks and [[Crotalus atrox|western diamondback rattlesnake]]s (''Crotalus atrox''), the diets were most similar in that by number about 15-20% of all three species' diets depended on [[Cottontail rabbit|cottontail]]s, but the largest portion was made up of [[ground squirrel]]s in the hawk and the rattlesnake and desert woodrats and other assorted [[rodent]]s in the great horned owl.<ref name= Fitch/> In the [[Taiga|boreal forests]], the great horned owl's prolificacy as a [[snowshoe hare]] hunter places it second only to the [[Canada lynx]] (''Lynx canadensis'') among all predators. Although locally dependent on the hares as their main food, [[northern goshawk]]s (''Accipiter gentilis''), red-tailed hawks and golden eagles apparently do not have as large of an impact on the hares, nor do mammalian carnivore generalists that also kill many hares, like the [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]], [[bobcat]], [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo''), [[coyote]] and larger varieties (i.e. [[Gray wolf|wolves]] (''Canis lupus''), [[cougar]]s (''Puma concolor'') and [[bear]]s (''Ursus'' ssp.)).<ref name= Rohner/><ref name= Houston2/><ref name= Mcinvaille/><ref>WLM. (1918). ''Bird Enemies of the Varying Hare''. The Auk, 372-373.</ref>\n\nThe relationship between great horned owls and other raptorial birds in its range is usually decidedly one-sided. While certain species, such as the red-tailed hawk and [[northern goshawk]], might be seen as potential competition for the owls, most others seem to be regarded merely as prey by great horned owls. The great horned owl is both the most prolific and diverse predator in America of other birds of prey, with other accomplished raptor-hunters such as the goshawk and the golden eagle being more restricted in range, habitat and number in North America and thus having a more minor impact. All studies have found raptors are a small portion of this owl's diet but predation can be seriously detrimental for such prey, as raptors tend to be territorial and sparsely distributed as a rule and thus can be effectively decimated by a small number of losses.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Cromrich/> In the [[gray hawk]] (''Buteo plagiatus''), for example, in a study of one breeding block of [[Arizona]], the owls were observed to visit nests nightly until all the nestlings were gone.<ref>Bibles, Brent D., Richard L. Glinski and R. Roy Johnson. 2002. ''Gray Hawk (Buteo plagiatus)'', The Birds of North America Online (A. Poole, Ed.). Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology.</ref>\n\nRaptorial birds in general tend to have large, conspicuous nests which may make them easier for a hunting owl to locate. The great horned owl gains an advantage by nesting earlier than any other raptor in its range (indeed any bird), as it is able to exploit the other raptors as food while in a more vulnerable state as their own nestlings have become well developed.<ref name= Craighead/> On average, great horned owls begin nesting about three weeks before red-tailed hawks begin to build nests, although some raptors may locally breed as much as two months after the owls.<ref name= Houston/><ref name= Dunstan>Dunstan, T. C., & Harrell, B. E. (1973). ''Spatio-temporal relationships between breeding red-tailed hawks and great horned owls in South Dakota''. Raptor Research, 7(2), 49\u201354.</ref>\n\nMore so than diurnal varieties of raptor, fairly significant numbers of owls are hunted, as all species are to some extent nocturnal and thus their corresponding activity can attract the horned owl's unwanted attention. The extent of predation on other owls depends on the habitat preferences of the other species. Eastern and western screech owls may be most vulnerable since they prefer similar wooded edge habitat. In a block of [[Wisconsin]], great horned owls were responsible for the failure of 78% of eastern screech owl's nests.<ref name= Craighead/> Long-eared owls and, to a lesser extent, barn owls tend to hunt in open, sparsely treed habitats more so than great horned owls, but since they may return to wooded spots for nesting purposes, they may be more vulnerable there. The long-eared owl and barn owls are often compared to the great horned owl as these medium-sized species often occur in abutting habitats and often hunt primarily the same vole and mice species, although the alternate prey of the great horned tends to be much larger, including the smaller owls themselves.<ref name= Earhart/><ref name= Rudolph/><ref>Barrows, C.

In the boreal forests, both the northern hawk owl and great grey owl appear to be in greater danger of great horned owl predation in years where the snowshoe hare have low populations.<ref name= Duncan>Duncan, J.

Anecdotally, both snowy and great horned owls have rarely been reported to dominate or even kill one another depending on the size and disposition of the individual owls, although the snowy's preference for more open areas again acts as something of a buffer. The snowy may be the one North American owl too formidable for the great horned owl to consider as prey.<ref name= Potapov/>\n\nWhereas owls of any age are freely attacked by great horned owls whether nesting or not, when it comes to diurnal raptors, great horned owls are mainly a danger around the nest. They often hunt diurnal raptors when they come across their often relatively conspicuous active platform nests during hunting forays in spring and summer, taking numbers of both nestlings and brooding adults.<ref name= Houston/> Again, like owls, diurnal raptors are attacked depending on the relative similarity of their habitat preferences to the owl. [[Cooper's hawk]]s (''Accipiter cooperii'') and red-tailed hawks tend to be most vulnerable, as they prefer the same wooded edges frequented by great horned owls. Other diurnal raptors may be attracted to more enclosed wooded areas, such as [[sharp-shinned hawk]]s (''Accipiter striatus'') or [[zone-tailed hawk]]s (''Buteo albonotatus''), or more open plain and meadow areas, such as [[Northern harrier]]s (''Circus hudsonius'') and ferruginous hawks, but this is almost never a total insurance against predation as all of these are recorded prey.<ref name= Hamerstrom/><ref>Stoleson, S.

In most of North America, courtship is from October to December and mates are chosen by December to January.<ref name=Konig/> This species was once thought to be strictly monogamous, but recent analysis indicates one male may mate with two females simultaneously, as was discovered for the first time in 2018 in Reno, Nevada.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/animals-owls-birds-parenting-polygamy/#close | title=These Owl Chicks Have Two Moms and a Dad\u2014a First| date=2018-05-02}}</ref> During courtship in late fall or early winter, the male attracts the attention of his mate by hooting emphatically while leaning over (with the tail folded or cocked) and puffing up his white throat to look like a ball.<ref name= Konig/> The white throat may serve as a visual stimuli in the low light conditions typical of when this owl courts.<ref name= Rohner/> He often flies up and down on a perch, while approaching the potential mate. Eventually, he comes to approach the female and tries to rub his bill against hers while repeatedly bowing. If receptive, the female hoots back when the pair meet but is more subdued in both her hoot and display. The male may convince the female by bringing her freshly caught prey, which they will share.<ref name=Bent/><ref name= Konig/> While males often hoot emphatically for about a month or six weeks towards the end of the year, the period where females also hoot is usually only a week to ten days.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Pairs typically breed together year after year and may mate for life, although they associate with each other more loosely when their young become mostly independent.<ref name= Konig/> Pairs rekindling their reproductive relationship in the winter may perform a milder courtship to strengthen pair bonds before producing young.<ref name= Baumgartner/>\n\nMales select nesting sites and bring the females' attention to them by flying to them and then stomping on them.<ref name=Konig/> Nests with open access, considering this birds large size, as opposed to enclosed with surrounding branches, are preferred. Like all owls, great horned owls do not build their own nest. Great horned owls tend to examine an area for an abandoned nest, generally from larger birds like hawks, and take over the nest for raising their own young.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morse|first=Douglass H.|date=April 1971|title=Great Horned Owls and Nesting Seabirds|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4083889|journal=The Auk|volume=88|issue=2|pages=426\u2013427|doi=10.2307/4083889|issn=0004-8038}}</ref> They nest in a wider variety of nest sites than any other North American bird.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Many nests are in cavernous hollows of dead trees or their branches, especially in southern states in large trees along the edge of old-growth lots.<ref name= Baumgartner/> In mountainous or hilly areas, especially in canyons of the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]] and [[Rocky Mountains]], cliff ledges, small caves, and other sheltered depressions may be used.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Owls living in prairie country, in the absence of other animals' nests, riparian trees or non-native trees or the bare ground of tree hollows or man-made structures, will use boulders, buttes, railroad cuts, low bushes and even the bare ground as nest sites.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Ground nests have also been recorded in the midst of tall grasses in [[Florida]] and in the midsts of brushy spots on the desert ground.<ref name= Voous/> Even the burrow entrances of [[American badger]] and [[coyote]] dens have reportedly been used as nests, in spite of the inherent risk of sharing space with such potentially dangerous co-inhabitants.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Nesting behavior for the great horned owl appears to be more closely related to prey availability than it does to seasonal conditions. There has been some evidence to support that if prey availability is low enough that the species may forgo mating entirely for a season. Male and female owls of the species have been observed to help incubate the eggs once they have been laid on a nest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greathornedowl.net/great-horned-owl-nest/|title=Great Horned Owl Nest \u2013 Interesting Facts & Information|last=WALEED|date=2018-08-29|website=Great Horned Owl|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bubo virginianus00.jpg|thumb|right|A brooding female common great horned owl (''B. v. virginianus'') on her nest in [[Louisiana]]]]\nMost tree nests used by great horned owls are constructed by other animals, often from a height of about {{convert|4.5|to|22|m|ft|abbr=on}} off the ground. They often take over a nest used by some other large bird, sometimes adding feathers to line the nest but usually not much more. Allegedly there have some cases where the owls have reinforced a nest structure or appeared to have reconstructed a nest, but as a rule no owl species has ever been known to actually build a nest.<ref name= Baumgartner/> Great horned owls in the southwest may also use nests in [[Cactus|cacti]], built by [[Harris's hawk]] and red-tailed hawk, as well as large hollows in cacti.<ref>Mader, W.

In [[Southern Florida]], eggs may be laid as early as late November to as late as early January. In the [[Southeastern United States|southeast]], from south [[Texas]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], egg laying may begin from late December to early February. From [[Southern California]] to northern [[Louisiana]], egg laying is from early February to late March. The largest swath of egg-laying owls from central California to [[South Carolina]] to as far north as [[Ohio]] and [[Massachusetts]] is from late February to early April. In the [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Northwestern United States]], northern [[New England]] and eastern Canada, egg laying is from early March to late April.

Gradually the soft juvenal downy plumage comes through the down, being typically a cinnamon-buff color, but with variable hues predicting the eventual color of the mature owls. The extent of down gradually diminishes, developing mature-looking plumage by late summer, although many first year birds still have scattered bits of down into autumn. By late autumn, first-year birds look similar to adults but with a slightly warmer, reddish tinge, less well developed ear tufts and a smaller white throat patch.<ref name= Bent/> The nestling owls develop mostly in behavior between two weeks and two months of age, in which time they adapt the ability to defend themselves, grasp foods and climb. Vocally, the young are able to exert weak chips while still in the egg, developing into a raspy chirp shortly after hatching. The calls of the young increase rapidly in intensity, pitch and character, some juvenile males mimicking their father's hooting in fall but usually they conclude with various odd gurgling notes. The earliest competent hooting by juvenile owls is not until January.<ref name= Houston/><ref>Sumner, Jr., E. L. 1934. ''The behavior of some young raptorial birds''.

Occasionally, nestlings and fledglings will fall from the nest too early to escape or to competently defend themselves and fall prey to [[fox]]es, [[bobcat]], [[coyote]]s, or wild or feral [[cat]]s. Occasionally [[raccoon]]s and [[American black bear]]s consume eggs and nestlings from tree nests and [[Virginia opossum]] may take the rare unguarded egg.<ref name= Voous/><ref name= Houston/> [[Crow]]s and [[raven]]s have been reported eating eggs and small nestlings. This can normally only happen when owls are driven from the nest by human activity or are forced to leave the nest to forage by low food resources but on occasion huge flocks of crows have been able to displace owls by harassing them endlessly.<ref name= Bent/><ref name= Houston/> In general, great horned owls rarely engage in [[siblicide]], unlike many other raptorial birds.

The [[Arikara]] of the [[Great Plains]] had mystic owl societies in which initiates were made to adorn facial mask made of the wing and tail feathers of great horned owls. Some Indian nations regarded the great horned owl as a friendly spirit who could aid in matters of love, such as the [[Passamaquoddy]] of [[Maine]] who felt the call of this species was a magical love flute designed to ignite human passions. The [[Hopi]] of the [[Southwestern United States|southwest]] also associated this owl with fertility, albeit of a different kind: they believed the calling of the owls into summer predicted hot weather, which produced good peach crops. During the [[winter solstice]], the Hopi performed a ceremony with great horned owl feathers in hopes of summoning the heat of summer. Tribes in [[New Mexico]] were known to use owl wing feathers to produce arrows which could strike their enemies with a minimum of sound. The [[Zuni people|Zuni]] held owl feathers in their mouths hoping to gain some of the silence that owls use in ambushes while striking their own enemies from other tribes. The [[Iroquois]] felt the origin of the great horned owl was due to an unformed owl annoying [[Iroquois mythology|Raweno]], the almighty creator, while Raweno created the [[rabbit]], causing Raweno to make the owl \"covered with mud\" (dark camouflage) and doomed to ceaselessly call \"whoo whoo\", which he used while harassing Raweno, by night because Raweno was active during the day.<ref name=DwightSmith/>\n\n===Provincial bird===\n\nThe great horned owl is the [[List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial bird]] of [[Alberta]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Horned Owl (Bubo virginianus)|url=http://aep.alberta.ca/fish-wildlife/wild-species/birds/owls/great-horned-owl.aspx|website=Alberta Environment & Parks}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Accordi|first=Iury Almeida|author2=Barcellos, Andre|title=Composi\u00e7\u00e3o da avifauna em oito \u00e1reas \u00famidas da Bacia Hidrogr\u00e1fica do Lago Gua\u00edba, Rio Grande do Sul|journal=Revista Brasileira de Ornitologia|date=June 2006|volume=14|issue=2|pages=101\u2013115|url=http://www.ararajuba.org.br/sbo/ararajuba/artigos/Volume142/ara142art2.pdf|language=Portuguese, English|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219192057/http://www.ararajuba.org.br/sbo/ararajuba/artigos/Volume142/ara142art2.pdf|archivedate=2008-12-19}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Banks|first=R.C. |author2=Cicero, C. |author3=Dunn, J.L. |author4=Kratter, A.W. |author5=Ouellet, H. |author6=Rasmussen, P.C. |author7=Remsen, J.V.

Friendly''' (born '''Ferdinand Friendly Wachenheimer''', October 30, 1915 \u2013 March 3, 1998) was a president of [[CBS|CBS News]] and the creator, along with [[Edward R. Murrow]], of the documentary television program ''[[See It Now]]''. He originated the concept of [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]] channels.\n\n==Early career==\nFriendly was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family<ref>{{Cite web|first= David B. |last=Green |authorlink=   |title= This Day in Jewish History, 1915 The Man Who Founded Television That Matters Is Born  |publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date= October 30, 2015|url= https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/the-man-who-good-tv-is-born-1.5415052 |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first=Stephen J. |last=Whitfield |authorlink=   |title=The American Jew as Journalist  |publisher=[[PolicyArchive]]|date= |url=http://research.policyarchive.org/10113.pdf  |accessdate=}}</ref> in New York City to Therese Friendly Wachenheimer and Samuel Wachenheimer, a jewelry manufacturer. The family moved from Manhattan's [[Morningside Heights]] district (where later, Friendly would teach for a quarter-century) to [[Providence, Rhode Island]], where he was graduated from [[Hope High School (Rhode Island)|Hope Street High School]] in 1933. He received an [[associate degree]] from [[Nichols College|Nichols Junior College]] in 1936.<ref name=\"FREDFRIENDLYPAPERS\"/>\n\nHe entered radio broadcasting in 1937 at [[WPRV|WEAN]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]], where he reversed the order of his middle and last names, and began using Friendly as his last name.<ref name=\"NYT-obituary\"/> In [[World War II]], he served as an instructor in the Army Signal Corps and reported for an Army newspaper in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] (''The CBI Roundup'') before mustering out as a [[master sergeant]] in 1945. His decorations included the [[Legion of Merit]] and the [[Soldier's Medal]].\n\nBy the late 1940s, Friendly was an experienced radio producer. It was in this role that Friendly first worked with Murrow on the [[Columbia Records]] historical albums, ''I Can Hear It Now''. The first entry in the series, released on Thanksgiving Day 1948, covered the crisis and war years 1933\u20131945. It was a ground-breaker in that it used clips of radio news coverage and speeches of the major events from that twelve-year time span. Friendly created the concept after noticing the new use of audiotape in regular radio news coverage, as opposed to wire or disc recordings that had been an industry standard. Periodically, Friendly created recordings of news events when such recordings didn't exist or, recreated ones that were considered too chaotic to use on an album [https://www.npr.org/programs/lnfsound/stories/990709.stories.html]. CBS correspondent [[David Schoenbrun]], in his memoir ''On and Off the Air'', said he once was forced by Friendly to ask [[Charles de Gaulle]] if he would recreate the speech he gave upon his return to [[Paris]] (de Gaulle refused). The recreations never were identified as such, and trying to separate the real from the recreated, continues to be problematic for radio [[historian]]s.\n\nAlthough Murrow was an established CBS name and at the time Columbia Records was owned by CBS, Friendly's next full-time work came as a news producer at [[NBC]]. It was there that Friendly originated the idea for the news-oriented quiz show ''[[Who Said That?]]'', first hosted by NBC newsman [[Robert Trout]], followed by [[Walter Kiernan]], and [[John Charles Daly]]. The program, which Friendly edited, ran irregularly on NBC and then [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] between 1948 and 1955.<ref>{{cite book|url=\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=DyS3t8z6_ckC&pg=PA622 |title=Who Said That? in Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh, A Complete Directory to Prime Time Cable and Network TV Shows, 1946 - Present, p. 978|publisher=New York: Random House Publishing, 2003|accessdate=June 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFriendly later wrote, directed, and produced the NBC Radio series ''The Quick and the Dead'' during the Summer of 1950. It was about the development of the atomic bomb. It featured Trout, [[Bob Hope]], and ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' writer [[William L. Laurence|Bill Laurence]], who had won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his coverage of the [[Manhattan Project]].\n\n==CBS years==\nAfter the success of ''The Quick and the Dead'', Friendly was recruited to work full-time for CBS by news executive Sig Mickelson. That fall, Murrow and Friendly collaborated to produce a CBS Radio documentary series inspired by their record albums\u2014a weekly show called ''Hear It Now'' that was hosted by Murrow. The show moved to television as ''See It Now'' on Sunday, November 18, 1951.\n\nMurrow and Friendly broadcast a revealing ''See It Now'' documentary analysis on Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] (airing March 9, 1954) that has been credited with changing the public view of McCarthy and, being a key event leading to McCarthy's fall from power. It was an extension of the duo's continuing probe of the conflict between McCarthy's [[anti-communism|anti-Communist]] crusade and individual rights.\n\nThe previous fall, Murrow and Friendly had produced a notable ''See It Now'' episode on the topic, when the show probed the case of Air Force Reserve Lieutenant [[Milo Radulovich]], who had lost his security clearance because of the supposed leftist leanings of his sister and father\u2014evidence the Air Force kept sealed. Five weeks later, Radulovich was reinstated by the secretary of the Air Force. Radulovich was granted leave of his duties that same year, however, when he was forced to move temporarily to Phoenix, Arizona to care for his nephew who had recently been involved in a [[Dog bite|dog mauling]] incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/arizona/supreme-court/1959/6297-0.html|title=Litzkuhn v. Clark|website=justia.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''See It Now'' ended, in the Summer of 1958, Friendly and Murrow worked together on its successor, ''CBS Reports'', although Friendly alone was executive producer and Murrow no more than an occasional reporter and narrator. Their most famous ''CBS Reports'' installment\u2014the probe of migrant farm workers ''[[Harvest of Shame]]''\u2014aired in November 1960 and still is considered one of television's finest single programs.\n\nAfter Murrow's departure from the [[television network]] in 1961, Friendly continued to oversee several notable ''CBS Reports'' documentaries, including ''Who Speaks for Birmingham?'', ''Birth Control and the Law'', and ''The Business of Heroin''.\n\nUnder CBS president [[James T. Aubrey Jr.]] the pressures on CBS News operations arose and escalated. Aubrey constantly fought with Friendly. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, ''Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control'', recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey spoke at length of how much money the news was costing the company, being a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. CBS founder and board chairman [[William S. Paley]] supported the news, however, and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. In 1962, Aubrey ordered that there would be fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move. To Friendly's relief, in 1965 Aubrey was fired.\n\nFriendly served as president of CBS News from 1964 to 1966.<ref name=\"ct398\">{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-03-08/news/9803080102_1_theodore-w-schultz-glaxo-wellcome-plc-human-capital | title=Fred W.

Salant|Dick Salant]], the executive who preceded and later succeeded Friendly in the role, wrote in his memoirs that Friendly's problem was compounded by his inability to make such a request directly to the top CBS management ([[William S. Paley]] and [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]]), as previous CBS News presidents had. In this case, Friendly had to go through a new supervisor at the executive level, CBS Broadcast Group president [[John A. Schneider|Jack Schneider]].\n\n==Later career==\nAfter he left CBS, Friendly initially worked as a broadcast consultant at the [[Ford Foundation]], a position he maintained until 1980. In this capacity, he initially developed an infeasible plan to allocate revenue generated by communications satellites toward the nascent medium of [[public television]] before he emerged as an integral figure in \"negotiations about interconnection that would lead to the creation of the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) in 1969.\" By ensuring [[National Educational Television]]'s subordination to the Washington-based PBS through the merger of NET with New York City's WNDT (and including a $2 million Ford Foundation grant to bolster the station's local programming), Friendly reluctantly placated members of the Nixon administration who perceived NET as a propagandistic front for the [[Eastern Establishment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXgwZpaTmEoC&pg=PA288|title=Friendlyvision: Fred Friendly and the Rise and Fall of Television Journalism|first=Ralph|last=Engelman|date=1 April 2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nDespite his relative dearth of formal education\u2014not atypical among contemporaneous practitioners\u2014he was appointed to the tenured faculty of the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]] as the Edward R. Murrow Professor of Broadcast Journalism in 1966.\n\nOver the next thirteen years, Friendly assumed stewardship of the school's hitherto threadbare broadcast journalism concentration. To the chagrin of some of his colleagues, he often eclipsed other top administrators (including 1970s-era dean [[Elie Abel]], who was personally recommended by Friendly for the post) in the popular consciousness. The non-degree Summer Program in Journalism for Members of Minority Groups (renamed the Michele Clark Fellowship Program for Minority Journalists following the death of a distinguished alumna in a December 1972 airplane crash) was directed by Friendly from 1968 to 1975, enabling many individuals (most notably media-savvy attorney [[Geraldo Rivera]]) to switch careers during the tempestuous epoch. A proposed \"University Broadcast Laboratory\" (an experimental Sunday news magazine initially proposed by Friendly in partnership with the Ford Foundation, Columbia, and NET) only manifested in attenuated form, however, as ''[[Public Broadcast Laboratory]]'' from 1967 to 1969; administrative and content circumscriptions imposed by the University trustees precipitated his divestiture from the program and hastened the retirement of Journalism School dean [[Edward W. Barrett]] in 1968. As chair of Mayor [[John Lindsay]]'s Task Force on [[CATV]] and [[Telecommunications]] that year, Friendly revived his revenue-sharing proposal by advising cable companies to set aside two channels that the public could lease for a minor fee, ultimately enabling the development of [[public-access television]].\n\nSpurred by classroom discussions, he inaugurated the Media and Society Friendly Seminars under the auspices of the Journalism School in 1974 as private conference fora on media, law (particularly the Constitution and the First Amendment) and public policy for the edification of professionals from disparate fields. Drawing upon the [[case method]] employed by many professional schools and the [[Socratic method]] for interlocution, these eventually metamorphosed into PBS's long-running ''Fred Friendly Seminars'' in 1981.\n\nFollowing his statutory retirement in 1979, Friendly relinquished control of the Journalism School's broadcast program; however, he continued to teach and produce the seminars at Columbia as an administrative officer of the University before retiring in earnest in 1992. By the time of his death in 1998, Friendly \"was criticized by some working in network news as being isolated in academia and out of touch with the new realities\u2014and limitations\u2014of the business of broadcast journalism.\"<ref name=\"NYT-obituary\"/> The broadcast newsroom and an endowed professorship remain named for Friendly, attesting to his outsized influence at a critical juncture in the development of the school.\n\nWhile in academia, he authored several books, including ''The Good Guys, The Bad Guys, And The First Amendment'' (an account of a number of First Amendment court cases and particularly, of the [[Fairness Doctrine]]), ''Minnesota Rag'' (a history of ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]''), ''[[The Constitution: That Delicate Balance]]'', and ''Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control'' (a memoir about his sixteen years at CBS).\n\nIn 1986, Friendly was appointed by Mayor [[Edward I. Koch]] to New York City's Charter Revision Commission. Chaired by [[Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr.]], the body's recommendations led to the dissolution of the [[New York City Board of Estimate]] following the adoption of the city's 1990 charter, whereupon the commission dissolved.\n\nFriendly was a Montgomery Fellow at [[Dartmouth College]] from April 9-April 12, 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~montfell/biographies/fellows_by_date.html|title=The Montgomery Fellows -|website=www.dartmouth.edu}}</ref> He also served as a visiting professor at [[Yale University]] (1984) and [[Bryn Mawr College]] (1981).\n\nIn addition to his work with the seminars, Friendly produced and hosted a ten-part series on PBS, ''[[Ethics in America]]'', on which a panel of leading intellectuals debated and discussed modern ethical issues.\n\n==Accolades==\n* 1967: Iris Award for Man of the Year from NATPE\n* 1986: [[Paul White (journalist)|Paul White]] Award, [[Radio Television Digital News Association]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtdna.org/content/paul_white_award#.U4FBHS8-Ngc |title=Paul White Award |publisher=[[Radio Television Digital News Association]] |accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref>\n* 1990: [[George Polk Award]]\n* 1994: [[Television Hall of Fame]]\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Fred Friendly Headstone 2011.JPG|thumb|The headstone of Fred Friendly]]\nFriendly died on March 3, 1998 of a stroke, at his home in [[Riverdale, Bronx]].<ref>{{cite news |title=TV news giant Friendly dies: Legacy of integrity and highest standards |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117468400.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 |quote=Fred Friendly, who put his stamp on a generation of news producers and correspondents as a hands-on executive during the glory days of CBS News in the 1950s and '60s under Edward R.

Friendly''' (born '''Ferdinand Friendly Wachenheimer''', October 30, 1915 \u2013 March 3, 1998) was a president of [[CBS|CBS News]] and the creator, along with [[Edward R. Murrow]], of the documentary television program ''[[See It Now]]''. He originated the concept of [[public-access television]] [[cable TV]] channels.\n\n==Early career==\nFriendly was born to a [[American Jews|Jewish]] family<ref>{{Cite web|first= David B. |last=Green |authorlink=   |title= This Day in Jewish History, 1915 The Man Who Founded Television That Matters Is Born  |publisher=[[Haaretz]]|date= October 30, 2015|url= https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/the-man-who-good-tv-is-born-1.5415052 |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first=Stephen J. |last=Whitfield |authorlink=   |title=The American Jew as Journalist  |publisher=[[PolicyArchive]]|date= |url=http://research.policyarchive.org/10113.pdf  |accessdate=}}</ref> in New York City to Therese Friendly Wachenheimer and Samuel Wachenheimer, a jewelry manufacturer. The family moved from Manhattan's [[Morningside Heights]] district (where later, Friendly would teach for a quarter-century) to [[Providence, Rhode Island]], where he was graduated from [[Hope High School (Rhode Island)|Hope Street High School]] in 1933. He received an [[associate degree]] from [[Nichols College|Nichols Junior College]] in 1936.<ref name=\"FREDFRIENDLYPAPERS\"/>\n\nHe entered radio broadcasting in 1937 at [[WPRV|WEAN]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]], where he reversed the order of his middle and last names, and began using Friendly as his last name.<ref name=\"NYT-obituary\"/> In [[World War II]], he served as an instructor in the Army Signal Corps and reported for an Army newspaper in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]] (''The CBI Roundup'') before mustering out as a [[master sergeant]] in 1945. His decorations included the [[Legion of Merit]] and the [[Soldier's Medal]].\n\nBy the late 1940s, Friendly was an experienced radio producer. It was in this role that Friendly first worked with Murrow on the [[Columbia Records]] historical albums, ''I Can Hear It Now''. The first entry in the series, released on Thanksgiving Day 1948, covered the crisis and war years 1933\u20131945. It was a ground-breaker in that it used clips of radio news coverage and speeches of the major events from that twelve-year time span. Friendly created the concept after noticing the new use of audiotape in regular radio news coverage, as opposed to wire or disc recordings that had been an industry standard. Periodically, Friendly created recordings of news events when such recordings didn't exist or, recreated ones that were considered too chaotic to use on an album [https://www.npr.org/programs/lnfsound/stories/990709.stories.html]. CBS correspondent [[David Schoenbrun]], in his memoir ''On and Off the Air'', said he once was forced by Friendly to ask [[Charles de Gaulle]] if he would recreate the speech he gave upon his return to [[Paris]] (de Gaulle refused). The recreations never were identified as such, and trying to separate the real from the recreated, continues to be problematic for radio [[historian]]s.\n\nAlthough Murrow was an established CBS name and at the time Columbia Records was owned by CBS, Friendly's next full-time work came as a news producer at [[NBC]]. It was there that Friendly originated the idea for the news-oriented quiz show ''[[Who Said That?]]'', first hosted by NBC newsman [[Robert Trout]], followed by [[Walter Kiernan]], and [[John Charles Daly]]. The program, which Friendly edited, ran irregularly on NBC and then [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] between 1948 and 1955.<ref>{{cite book|url=\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=DyS3t8z6_ckC&pg=PA622 |title=Who Said That? in Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh, A Complete Directory to Prime Time Cable and Network TV Shows, 1946 - Present, p. 978|publisher=New York: Random House Publishing, 2003|accessdate=June 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nFriendly later wrote, directed, and produced the NBC Radio series ''The Quick and the Dead'' during the Summer of 1950. It was about the development of the atomic bomb. It featured Trout, [[Bob Hope]], and ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' writer [[William L. Laurence|Bill Laurence]], who had won a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his coverage of the [[Manhattan Project]].\n\n==CBS years==\nAfter the success of ''The Quick and the Dead'', Friendly was recruited to work full-time for CBS by news executive Sig Mickelson. That fall, Murrow and Friendly collaborated to produce a CBS Radio documentary series inspired by their record albums\u2014a weekly show called ''Hear It Now'' that was hosted by Murrow. The show moved to television as ''See It Now'' on Sunday, November 18, 1951.\n\nMurrow and Friendly broadcast a revealing ''See It Now'' documentary analysis on Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] (airing March 9, 1954) that has been credited with changing the public view of McCarthy and, being a key event leading to McCarthy's fall from power. It was an extension of the duo's continuing probe of the conflict between McCarthy's [[anti-communism|anti-Communist]] crusade and individual rights.\n\nThe previous fall, Murrow and Friendly had produced a notable ''See It Now'' episode on the topic, when the show probed the case of Air Force Reserve Lieutenant [[Milo Radulovich]], who had lost his security clearance because of the supposed leftist leanings of his sister and father\u2014evidence the Air Force kept sealed. Five weeks later, Radulovich was reinstated by the secretary of the Air Force. Radulovich was granted leave of his duties that same year, however, when he was forced to move temporarily to Phoenix, Arizona to care for his nephew who had recently been involved in a [[Dog bite|dog mauling]] incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/cases/arizona/supreme-court/1959/6297-0.html|title=Litzkuhn v. Clark|website=justia.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''See It Now'' ended, in the Summer of 1958, Friendly and Murrow worked together on its successor, ''CBS Reports'', although Friendly alone was executive producer and Murrow no more than an occasional reporter and narrator. Their most famous ''CBS Reports'' installment\u2014the probe of migrant farm workers ''[[Harvest of Shame]]''\u2014aired in November 1960 and still is considered one of television's finest single programs.\n\nAfter Murrow's departure from the [[television network]] in 1961, Friendly continued to oversee several notable ''CBS Reports'' documentaries, including ''Who Speaks for Birmingham?'', ''Birth Control and the Law'', and ''The Business of Heroin''.\n\nUnder CBS president [[James T. Aubrey Jr.]] the pressures on CBS News operations arose and escalated. Aubrey constantly fought with Friendly. Friendly felt Aubrey was insufficiently concerned with public affairs and in his memoir, ''Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control'', recounts one budget meeting at CBS when Aubrey spoke at length of how much money the news was costing the company, being a sea of red ink that could be stopped by replacing news with more entertainment programs. CBS founder and board chairman [[William S. Paley]] supported the news, however, and protected Friendly's division from Aubrey's proposed budget cuts. In 1962, Aubrey ordered that there would be fewer specials, both entertainment and news, because he felt interruptions to the schedule alienated viewers by disrupting their routine viewing, sending them to the competition. Friendly resented this move. To Friendly's relief, in 1965 Aubrey was fired.\n\nFriendly served as president of CBS News from 1964 to 1966.<ref name=\"ct398\">{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-03-08/news/9803080102_1_theodore-w-schultz-glaxo-wellcome-plc-human-capital | title=Fred W.

Salant|Dick Salant]], the executive who preceded and later succeeded Friendly in the role, wrote in his memoirs that Friendly's problem was compounded by his inability to make such a request directly to the top CBS management ([[William S. Paley]] and [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]]), as previous CBS News presidents had. In this case, Friendly had to go through a new supervisor at the executive level, CBS Broadcast Group president [[John A. Schneider|Jack Schneider]].\n\n==Later career==\nAfter he left CBS, Friendly initially worked as a broadcast consultant at the [[Ford Foundation]], a position he maintained until 1980. In this capacity, he initially developed an infeasible plan to allocate revenue generated by communications satellites toward the nascent medium of [[public television]] before he emerged as an integral figure in \"negotiations about interconnection that would lead to the creation of the [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) in 1969.\" By ensuring [[National Educational Television]]'s subordination to the Washington-based PBS through the merger of NET with New York City's WNDT (and including a $2 million Ford Foundation grant to bolster the station's local programming), Friendly reluctantly placated members of the Nixon administration who perceived NET as a propagandistic front for the [[Eastern Establishment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXgwZpaTmEoC&pg=PA288|title=Friendlyvision: Fred Friendly and the Rise and Fall of Television Journalism|first=Ralph|last=Engelman|date=1 April 2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nDespite his relative dearth of formal education\u2014not atypical among contemporaneous practitioners\u2014he was appointed to the tenured faculty of the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]] as the Edward R. Murrow Professor of Broadcast Journalism in 1966.\n\nOver the next thirteen years, Friendly assumed stewardship of the school's hitherto threadbare broadcast journalism concentration. To the chagrin of some of his colleagues, he often eclipsed other top administrators (including 1970s-era dean [[Elie Abel]], who was personally recommended by Friendly for the post) in the popular consciousness. The non-degree Summer Program in Journalism for Members of Minority Groups (renamed the Michele Clark Fellowship Program for Minority Journalists following the death of a distinguished alumna in a December 1972 airplane crash) was directed by Friendly from 1968 to 1975, enabling many individuals (most notably media-savvy attorney [[Geraldo Rivera]]) to switch careers during the tempestuous epoch. A proposed \"University Broadcast Laboratory\" (an experimental Sunday news magazine initially proposed by Friendly in partnership with the Ford Foundation, Columbia, and NET) only manifested in attenuated form, however, as ''[[Public Broadcast Laboratory]]'' from 1967 to 1969; administrative and content circumscriptions imposed by the University trustees precipitated his divestiture from the program and hastened the retirement of Journalism School dean [[Edward W. Barrett]] in 1968. As chair of Mayor [[John Lindsay]]'s Task Force on [[CATV]] and [[Telecommunications]] that year, Friendly revived his revenue-sharing proposal by advising cable companies to set aside two channels that the public could lease for a minor fee, ultimately enabling the development of [[public-access television]].\n\nSpurred by classroom discussions, he inaugurated the Media and Society Friendly Seminars under the auspices of the Journalism School in 1974 as private conference fora on media, law (particularly the Constitution and the First Amendment) and public policy for the edification of professionals from disparate fields. Drawing upon the [[case method]] employed by many professional schools and the [[Socratic method]] for interlocution, these eventually metamorphosed into PBS's long-running ''Fred Friendly Seminars'' in 1981.\n\nFollowing his statutory retirement in 1979, Friendly relinquished control of the Journalism School's broadcast program; however, he continued to teach and produce the seminars at Columbia as an administrative officer of the University before retiring in earnest in 1992. By the time of his death in 1998, Friendly \"was criticized by some working in network news as being isolated in academia and out of touch with the new realities\u2014and limitations\u2014of the business of broadcast journalism.\"<ref name=\"NYT-obituary\"/> The broadcast newsroom and an endowed professorship remain named for Friendly, attesting to his outsized influence at a critical juncture in the development of the school.\n\nWhile in academia, he authored several books, including ''The Good Guys, The Bad Guys, And The First Amendment'' (an account of a number of First Amendment court cases and particularly, of the [[Fairness Doctrine]]), ''Minnesota Rag'' (a history of ''[[Near v. Minnesota]]''), ''[[The Constitution: That Delicate Balance]]'', and ''Due to Circumstances Beyond Our Control'' (a memoir about his sixteen years at CBS).\n\nIn 1986, Friendly was appointed by Mayor [[Edward I. Koch]] to New York City's Charter Revision Commission. Chaired by [[Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr.]], the body's recommendations led to the dissolution of the [[New York City Board of Estimate]] following the adoption of the city's 1990 charter, whereupon the commission dissolved.\n\nFriendly was a Montgomery Fellow at [[Dartmouth College]] from April 9-April 12, 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~montfell/biographies/fellows_by_date.html|title=The Montgomery Fellows -|website=www.dartmouth.edu}}</ref> He also served as a visiting professor at [[Yale University]] (1984) and [[Bryn Mawr College]] (1981).\n\nIn addition to his work with the seminars, Friendly produced and hosted a ten-part series on PBS, ''[[Ethics in America]]'', on which a panel of leading intellectuals debated and discussed modern ethical issues.\n\n==Accolades==\n* 1967: Iris Award for Man of the Year from NATPE\n* 1986: [[Paul White (journalist)|Paul White]] Award, [[Radio Television Digital News Association]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtdna.org/content/paul_white_award#.U4FBHS8-Ngc |title=Paul White Award |publisher=[[Radio Television Digital News Association]] |accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref>\n* 1990: [[George Polk Award]]\n* 1994: [[Television Hall of Fame]]\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Fred Friendly Headstone 2011.JPG|thumb|The headstone of Fred Friendly]]\nFriendly died on March 3, 1998 of a stroke, at his home in [[Riverdale, Bronx]].<ref>{{cite news |title=TV news giant Friendly dies: Legacy of integrity and highest standards |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117468400.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 |quote=Fred Friendly, who put his stamp on a generation of news producers and correspondents as a hands-on executive during the glory days of CBS News in the 1950s and '60s under Edward R.
