Once awoken she seeks out justice for the tormented, destroying all who stand in her way. When she becomes inhabited with the tortured consciousness of Maigo, a little girl brutally murdered by her own father, Nemesis seeks to make the world pay, starting with large cities filled with crunchy people.\n\n==The Characters==\n\nThe following are principal or recurring characters in the Nemesis Saga\n\n* Jon Hudson\n* Ashley Collins\n* Maigo\n* Katsu Endo\n* Mark Hawkings\n* Lilly\n* Rich \"Woodstock\" Woodall\n\n==The Kaiju==\n\nThe following [[Kaiju]] appear within the novels\n\n===Nemesis Prime (Corpse)=== \n\nNemesis Prime was the first Gestorumque (species name) to land on Earth as far as the books are concerned. The corpse of Nemesis Prime is found in a cave in Alaska by Katsu Endo, who becomes infatuated with the being from then on.\n\nDue to the recognition that early humans showed the beast, it can be inferred it was on Earth for some time before engaging in its true mission which was to destroy Atlantis and kill all people with Atlantean genes. This mission was given to it by the Aeros (one of two warring alien races). Its masters and their trait of hunting down those with Atlantean bloodlines can be somewhat seen in the present-day Nemesis. Nemesis Prime was killed during the assault on the city by Hyperion, a mech-Kaiju sent by the Ferox (the second warring alien race) to defend Atlantis. \n\nNemesis Prime is considerably bulkier than Nemesis, while still retaining all of its traits. Its skin is a darker black and more jagged than the current Nemesis. The Kaiju has three trident-tipped tails as opposed to Nemesis's one. Like all the Kaiju of its kind, it possesses orange membranes containing a liquid that explodes on contact with air. \n\nAshtaroth, a being comprised of many Kaiju species, has a secondary form not dissimilar to the Divine Retribution form of Nemesis. It is unclear whether or not Nemesis Prime and Neo Prime possess a form like this, nor is it clear if Nemesis Prime or Neo Prime have the ability to regurgitate and project the orange liquid like the present Nemesis can.\n\n=== Nemesis===\n\nNot a Kaiju born through natural means. Nemesis is the genetic clone of Nemesis Prime comprised of the human DNA of Maigo Tilly, later Maigo Hudson. Due to this unique mixing of DNA, Nemesis is quite unlike its brethren. \n\nAs soon as she was born and free to move around, Nemesis began eating people to stave off its insatiable appetite. This rapidly progressed to eating whales to satisfy the creatures vast hunger. Nemesis grew at an astonishing rate before slowing, if not fully stopping, at around 350 feet tall. \n\nDue to being killed by her stepfather, Maigo had an understandable rage towards the man and this rage drove Nemesis to seek him out through what was later explained as sensing an Atlantean gene. It would continue to seek out this gene, but only for the purpose of killing people worthy of her wrath, unlike its ancestor who sought it out merely to kill. Maigo gave Nemesis a conscious, making it humanities defender rather than executioner. Its lust for vengeance was so great however that this often meant stampeding through a city to reach its target. \n\nNemesis is able to be controlled, in part, by a pilot or \"Voice\". While Maigo took on this role Nemesis's eyes were a human-like brown reflecting Maigo's own. Once Maigo left Nemesis and was reconstituted in human form the Kaiju's eyes reverted to the same glowing orange seen in the other beasts. When Katsu Endo became Nemesis's voice later in the story arc her eyes retained the orange glow.\n\nNemesis seems able to remember all the torture Nemesis Prime was subjected to and as such her Voices also experience these memories. Due to these memories, Nemesis initially had an immense hatred for Hyperion, the mech-Kaiju that killed its ancestor. \n\nIn terms of appearance, it is a significantly lighter Kaiju than Nemesis Prime or Neo Prime. Its skin is black in color and has been described as fungal, meaning it is an entity separate from her and can grow back independently and at alarming rates. It possesses the orange glowing membranes like those in its family group. Nemesis, Nemesis Prime, Neo Prime, Karkinos, Typhon, Scylla, Drakon, and Scrion all appear to have this distinguishing attributes separating them from other Kaiju like Lovecraft or Giger, implying there are many races inside the Kaiju species. \n\nNemesis has razor-sharp claws and teeth, sharp enough to easily tear through the flesh of other Kaiju. The claws on Nemesis do not appear to have a solid design pinned down, the books describe the claws as two giant fingers fused together, while the comics and concept art show the Kaiju as having five separate fingers with claws at the end. It has a long trident tipped tail, the end seemingly composed of the same material as its claws. \n\nNemesis has two skills seemingly unique to other Kaiju. It can spit out a globule of the combustible orange liquid that is covered in a layer of its own saliva to ensure it doesn't explode until it reaches its target. \n\nIts second ability, while similar to Ashtaroth's, is still quite unique. When necessary, Nemesis excretes a mucus-like substance that allows it to shed its skin, which can later grow back, to reveal a form with gleaming white skin underneath. This ''Divine Retribution form'', as it was later named by Jon Hudson, while more fragile reveals two pure white wings. These wings aren't designed for flight. Each \"feather\" is a highly reflective mirror. When all the feathers are aligned correctly, the sun's light is refracted through to create a beam of pure heat energy, powerful enough to punch through Kaiju and buildings alike. These feathers fall off shortly after using the form. Nemesis is weakened and extremely vulnerable in its post-Divine Retribution form, so much so that even conventional weapons like missiles can injure it. \n\nIn the book many believe the dust made from the mirrors have some sort of healing property, however, it is never addressed and is likely that it has no purpose other than refracting light. \n\nNesmsis's wings can also be used for additional defense and they seem to hold up extremely well against the Self-Immolation attacks, the name adopted for the exploding membranes, as witnessed in the final battle of Washington D.C. and the massive self-immolation of Ashtaroth that appeared to kills Nemesis. \n\nNemesis is extremely resilient and has survived all manner of attacks from a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast [[MOAB]] strike to the Kaiju Self-Immolation seen in any book whose blast rivals that of several nuclear explosions, to every type of physical attack the Kaiju can throw at her. Despite this, Nemesis has been presumed dead twice, the first time revealed her to be alive shortly after, but the second time was in the battle of Project Legion and as of now, the humans are unaware of her survival. \n\nOceans are where she feels most comfortable, probably due to the lesser gravity on her incredibly heavy body and her current residence is under the ice of Europa, where she lives out her days swimming around the secret ecosystem.\n\n===Karkinos===\n\nKarkinos is the offspring from a brood comprised of 5 eggs laid by Nemesis Prime just before it died and is considered one of Nemesis's siblings. \n\nIts appearance is the closest to Nemesis Prime or Nemesis herself. It is larger, spikier, and slower. Arguably the strongest of the 5 born from Nemesis Prime and possibly stronger than Nemesis herself. \n\nIt has three large claws and a tail with a single spike at the end. Aside from its overwhelming size and strength, Karkinos has no unique powers. It can likely be confirmed that it has no secondary form since in Project Legion when it was split in half, there was no mention of a white skin underneath. Its thick skin was enough to repel the diamond-tipped drill of the Zoomb control devices. It, like all of its brethren, has a Self-Immolation attack. \n\nKarkinos has three separate book appearances, once in Project Maigo as the final Kaiju enemy in Washington D.C., once in Project Hyperion as a Voiceless clone, and again in Project Legion as a Kaiju clone piloted by Ashley Collins. Its first death was partially its own fault, General Gordon, who was controlling the five at the time, commanded Karkinos to Self-Immolate right next to the White House, intending to kill Jon Hudson in the process. Just in the nick of time, however, Nemesis stepped in front of the blast, using her wings to reflect the blast right back at the Kaiju, killing it almost instantly. Its second death was after being implanted with the Aeros Voice from the Nemesis Prime corpse. Its third death was at the hands of Ashtaroth, the final Kaiju enemy in Project Legion. As mentioned earlier, it was piloted by Ashley Collins and during the fight, it was stepped on and ripped in two. Technically the cloned Kaiju had no conscious at the time, so it was more Collins experiencing the death.\n\n===Typhon===\n\nTyphon was one of the 5 eggs laid by Nemesis Prime just before it died and is considered one of Nemesis's siblings. \n\nIt is the most humanoid of any of the Kaiju in the book, having five fingers and toes at the ends of black-armored arms and legs. It has no tail and a small number of defensive spikes on its elbows and knees. Under the control of Mark Hawkins, it was able to inflict considerable damage on Kaiju larger or stronger than it. This can be attributed to the fact that Hawkins was a trained hunter and has taken down opponents much larger than him before. It was also armed with massive stone knives at the time, giving him a huge advantage.\n\nTyphon has been deemed the smartest of the five. This is probably owing to the fact that it swatted away the Zoomb control device, despite already tanking multiple missle swarms. While the Kaiju alone never displays any advanced hand to hand tactics, it is inferred that under the control of an experienced fighter the Kaiju would be incredibly powerful against an opponent that was relatively close to its size. In fact, any Kaiju being piloted by a battle-worn human is shown to be much more effective in battle. As shown with Katsu Endo inside Nemesis and later on with the five cloned Kaiju, Karkinos, Scylla, Scrion, Typhon, and Drakon being piloted by five respective humans. \n\nThe only unique skill that Typhon seems to possess is the ability to have four claw-like appendages sprout from its mouth. These would likely be used to hold an enemy in place, however, the skill shows next to no use in the books. If anything, this uniqueness displays a flaw in the Kaiju's design. The ability to hold something in place with teeth would be better suited to a creature that has no opposable thumbs. With Typhon, who has two very humanlike arms there is no need for an extra grappling appendage. This trait is correctly displayed in Drakon's unique ability. However, there is the possibility that these claws are designed for intimidation, but against other Kaiju, these claws have never shown any effectiveness.\n\nTyphon has three book appearances, once in Project Maigo as the final Kaiju enemy in Washington D.C., once as a Voiceless clone in Project Hyperion, and again in Project Legion as a Kaiju clone piloted by Mark Hawkins. \n\n===Scylla===\n\nScylla was one of the 5 eggs laid by Nemesis Prime just before it died and is considered one of Nemesis's siblings.\n\nScylla is possibly one of the weirdest designs to come out of Nemesis Prime's offspring. It has a short and stout body, for a Kaiju that is, and a large, hammerhead-like head. It possesses a very short and overall useless tail. Like the other Kaiju, it has the same bone-colored claws and talons as well as the Self-Immolation Membranes on its body.\n\nWhile Scylla is arguably not the weakest, that title going to either Drakon or Scrion, who prioritize movement or strength, Scylla could still be considered far weaker than Nemesis, Karkinos, or Typhon. Despite not being overly powerful or unique, it has the most focus out of the five siblings. This is thanks to being under the control of Jon Hudson not just once, but twice, with a third pilot being Ted Watson before the cloned Kaiju's eventual death.\n\nSeemingly the only unique aspect of Scylla is its head. As Jon Hudson once described it, the design of the head allowed him to see much more than should've been possible for a normal human. In battle, whether controlled or free of a Voice, Scylla favors its incredible bite strength in order to damage enemies since its claws don't have enough force behind them to rival most of its brethren.\n\nScylla has three book appearances. Once in Project Maigo as the final Kaiju enemy in Washington D.C. that was taken over by Jon Hudson with the help of the Zoomb control device, once as a Voiceless clone in Project Hyperion, and again in Project Legion as a Kaiju clone piloted by Jon Hudson and subsequently Ted Watson. \n\n===Reoccurring  Kaiju===\n\nThe following are Kaiju which appear in one or more of the Nemesis Saga novels.\n\n* '' Drakon''\n* '' Scrion''\n* '' Giger''\n* '' Megatsuchi''\n* '' Lovecraft''\n* '' Gus''\n\n==Main series==\n\nThe main series consists of 5 novels, starting with ''Project Nemesis'' and ending with ''Project Legion''. Island 731 became canon  and an origins novel ''Prime''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Order !! Title !! Author(s) !! Publisher !!

With Typhon, who has two very humanlike arms there is no need for an extra grappling appendage. This trait is correctly displayed in Drakon's unique ability. However, there is the possibility that these claws are designed for intimidation, but against other Kaiju, these claws have never shown any effectiveness.\n\nTyphon has three book appearances, once in Project Maigo as the final Kaiju enemy in Washington D.C., once as a Voiceless clone in Project Hyperion, and again in Project Legion as a Kaiju clone piloted by Mark Hawkins. \n\n===Scylla===\n\nScylla was one of the 5 eggs laid by Nemesis Prime just before it died and is considered one of Nemesis's siblings.\n\nScylla is possibly one of the weirdest designs to come out of Nemesis Prime's offspring. It has a short and stout body, for a Kaiju that is, and a large, hammerhead-like head. It possesses a very short and overall useless tail. Like the other Kaiju, it has the same bone-colored claws and talons as well as the Self-Immolation Membranes on its body.\n\nWhile Scylla is arguably not the weakest, that title going to either Drakon or Scrion, who prioritize movement or strength, Scylla could still be considered far weaker than Nemesis, Karkinos, or Typhon. Despite not being overly powerful or unique, it has the most focus out of the five siblings. This is thanks to being under the control of Jon Hudson not just once, but twice, with a third pilot being Ted Watson before the cloned Kaiju's eventual death.\n\nSeemingly the only unique aspect of Scylla is its head. As Jon Hudson once described it, the design of the head allowed him to see much more than should've been possible for a normal human. In battle, whether controlled or free of a Voice, Scylla favors its incredible bite strength in order to damage enemies since its claws don't have enough force behind them to rival most of its brethren.\n\nScylla has three book appearances. Once in Project Maigo as the final Kaiju enemy in Washington D.C. that was taken over by Jon Hudson with the help of the Zoomb control device, once as a Voiceless clone in Project Hyperion, and again in Project Legion as a Kaiju clone piloted by Jon Hudson and subsequently Ted Watson. \n\n===Reoccurring  Kaiju===\n\nThe following are Kaiju which appear in one or more of the Nemesis Saga novels.\n\n* '' Drakon''\n* '' Scrion''\n* '' Giger''\n* '' Megatsuchi''\n* '' Lovecraft''\n* '' Gus''\n\n==Main series==\n\nThe main series consists of 5 novels, starting with ''Project Nemesis'' and ending with ''Project Legion''. Island 731 became canon  and an origins novel ''Prime''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Order !! Title !! Author(s) !! Publisher !!

{"title_page": "Particles of the Kagoshima dialects", "text_new": "The [[grammatical particle]]s ({{lang|ja|\u52a9\u8a5e}} ''joshi'') used in the [[Kagoshima dialect]]s of Japanese have many features in common with those of other dialects spoken in [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], with some being unique to the Kagoshima dialects. Like [[japanese particles|standard Japanese particles]], they act as suffixes, adpositions or words immediately following the noun, verb, adjective or phrase that they modify, and are used to indicate the relationship between the various elements of a sentence.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://japanese.about.com/blparticles.htm | title=Japanese Particles | publisher=About.com | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.timwerx.net/language/particles.htm | title=Japanese Particles | first=Tim R. | last=Matheson | publisher=Tim's Takamatsu | year=2008 | accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref>\n\nUnlike central Japanese dialects, particles in the Kagoshima dialects are bound [[clitic]]s, as they have the effect of resyllabifying the last word they attach to. So, for example, the standard forms {{lang|ja|\u672c\u3092}} ''hon o'' \"book {{gcl|ACC}}\", {{lang|ja|\u66f8\u304d\u3092}} ''kaki o'' \"writing {{gcl|ACC}}\" and {{lang|ja|\u307e\u308a\u3092}} ''mari o'' \"ball {{gcl|ACC}}\" would be realized as {{IPA|/hoNno/}}, {{IPA|/kakjo/}} and {{IPA|/majo/}} ( \u2190 {{IPA|/ma\u027djo/}}) in most of northern and central Kagoshima, and {{IPA|/hoNnu/}}, {{IPA|/kakju/~/kaku/}} and {{IPA|/maju/}} ( \u2190 {{IPA|/ma\u027dju/}}) in parts of Kagoshima's southern mainland.<ref>Shibatani (1990), p. 210</ref>\n\nResyllabification has also led to the reanalysis of some particles in a few dialects. For instance, the topic particle ''(w)a'' has been completely superseded by the form ''na'' in [[Izumi, Kagoshima|Izumi]],<ref name=\"Izumi\">{{cite web | url=http://sky.geocities.jp/ryohusyokyoryu/izumigo.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234707/http://sky.geocities.jp/ryohusyokyoryu/izumigo.html | archivedate=2013-12-02 | script-title=ja:\u5317\u85a9\u51fa\u6c34\u8a9e\u3092\u8a71\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046\uff01 | language=Japanese |trans-title=Let's learn the Hokusatsu district Izumi dialect! | accessdate=2012-04-22}}</ref> which in most mainland dialects is merely a variant of ''(w)a'' after a moraic nasal.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Resyllabification rules ==\n\nWhen a word is followed by a particle that starts with a vowel (such as the topic particle {{lang|ja|\u306f}} ''a'', the accusative particle {{lang|ja|\u3092}} ''o'' or the dative particle {{lang|ja|\u3044}} ''i''), the final syllable of that word will be fused with the particle and be subject to Kagoshima's [[kagoshima dialect#Coalescence|vowel coalescence rules]] as well as other sound changes occurring in the regional dialect. As a simple example, when the word {{lang|ja|\u3053\u308c}} {{IPA|/ko\u027de/}} ''kore'' \"this\" is followed by the topic particle {{lang|ja|\u306f}} {{IPA|/a/}}, it becomes {{lang|ja|\u3053\u308a\u3083}} {{IPA|/ko\u027dja/}} ''korya'' \"this={{gcl|TOP}}\". A secondary sound change in Mainland Kagoshima then causes the medial {{IPA|/\u027dj/}} ''ry'' to become {{IPA|/j/}} ''y'', giving the common form {{lang|ja|\u3053\u3084}} {{IPA|/koja/}} ''koya'' \"this={{gcl|TOP}}\".\n\nTwo main exceptions to this rule exist:\n\n# If a word's underlying form ends in a moraic nasal (i.e. {{IPA|/N/}}), an [[Epenthesis|epenthetic]] {{IPA|/n/}} is inserted between the word and the particle. For example, {{lang|ja|\u672c}} {{IPA|/hoN/}} ''hon'' \"book\" becomes {{lang|ja|\u672c\u306f}} {{IPA|/hoNna/}} ''honna'' when fused with the topic particle.\n# If a word's underlying form ends in a long vowel or sequence of vowels, then an epenthetic consonant is sometimes inserted between the word and the topic particle. In the case of topic particle {{lang|ja|\u306f}} ''a'' and the accusative particle {{lang|ja|\u3092}} ''o'', the epenthetic consonant is {{IPA|/w/}}. In the case of the dative particle {{lang|ja|\u3044}} ''i'', the epenthetic consonant is {{IPA|/n/}}. This rule is not consistently applied across all dialects of Kagoshima.\n\nThe following table shows how particles change the final syllable of words in the mainland Kagoshima dialects.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Resyllabification in mainland Kagoshima\n|-\n!| Meaning\n!| [[Underlying representation|Underlying form]]\n!| Pronunciation in isolation\n!| Topic particle ({{lang|ja|\u306f}} ''(w)a'')\n!| Accusative particle ({{lang|ja|\u3092}} ''o'')\n!| Dative particle ({{lang|ja|\u3044}} ''i'')\n|-\n| this\n| {{IPA|/ko\u027de/}}\n| {{IPA|/koi/}}\n| {{IPA|/koja/}}\n| {{IPA|/kojo/}}\n| {{IPA|/ko\u027de/}}\n|-\n| writing\n| {{IPA|/kaki/}}\n| {{IPA|/kaQ/}}\n| {{IPA|/kakja/}} or {{IPA|/kaka/}}<ref name=\"NozomiKendaka\" />\n| {{IPA|/kakjo/}} or {{IPA|/kaku/}}<ref name=\"NozomiKendaka\" />\n| {{IPA|/kaki/}}\n|-\n| ball\n| {{IPA|/ma\u027di/}}\n| {{IPA|/mai/}}\n| {{IPA|/maja/}}\n| {{IPA|/majo/}}\n| {{IPA|/ma\u027di/}}\n|-\n| song\n| {{IPA|/uta/}}\n| {{IPA|/uta/}}\n| {{IPA|/uta/}}\n| {{IPA|/utao/}}\n| {{IPA|/ute/}}\n|-\n| hitting\n| {{IPA|/ut\u0361\u0255i/}}\n| {{IPA|/uQ/}}\n| {{IPA|/ut\u0361\u0255a/}}\n| {{IPA|/ut\u0361\u0255o/}}, {{IPA|/ut\u0361\u0255u/}} or {{IPA|/ut\u0361su/}}\n| {{IPA|/ut\u0361\u0255i/}}\n|-\n| person<ref name=\"NozomiKendaka\" />\n| {{IPA|/hito/}}\n| {{IPA|/hito/}}\n| {{IPA|/hita/}}\n| {{IPA|/hito/}}\n| {{IPA|/hite/}}\n|-\n| study<ref name=\"NozomiKendaka\" />\n| {{IPA|/beNkjoo/}}\n| {{IPA|/beNkjo/}}\n| {{IPA|/beNkjoa/}}\n| {{IPA|/beNkjoo/}}\n| {{IPA|/beNkjoi/}}\n|-\n| book\n| {{IPA|/hoN/}}\n| {{IPA|/hoN/}}\n| {{IPA|/hoNna/}}\n| {{IPA|/hoNno/}}\n| {{IPA|/hoNni/}}\n|}\n\nThe rules of resyllabification differ only slightly in peripheral areas.

Unlike other types of particles such as case particles or conjunctive particles, sentence-final particles do not indicate the [[grammatical relation]] of different elements in a clause. Instead, they can be described as indicating \"the illocutionary force of the proposition as well as the speaker's attitude towards the proposition and/or the interloculor(s)\".<ref>{{cite book | first=Yoko | last=Hasegawa| title=Soliloquy in Japanese and English | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing | year=2010 | isbn=9027256063 | page=41}}</ref> This means that, among other things, sentence-final particles can be used to indicate how true the speaker believes the utterance is (e.g. definitely true, probably true, hearsay, personal opinion, etc.), to express the speaker's personal feelings towards the utterance (e.g. admiration, shock, etc.), or to solicit a reaction from the listener. They can also vary based on the speaker's relation with the listener and the degree of politeness they wish to express.\n\n=== Modality markers ===\n{{see also|Linguistic modality}}\n\n==== (w)ai, (w)a and i ====\nThe particle {{lang|ja|\u3042\u3044}} ''ai'' or more rarely {{lang|ja|\u308f\u3044}} ''wai'' is a sentence-final particle used to emphasize the utterance and to indicate that the speaker is expressing their own view. This particle attaches to the preceding word (typically a verb in its non-past form) and often fuses with the vowel of the final syllable of that word. Functionally, this particle is similar in usage to the particle {{lang|ja|\u3088}} ''yo'' in standard Japanese.

Like [[japanese particles|standard Japanese particles]], they act as suffixes, adpositions or words immediately following the noun, verb, adjective or phrase that they modify, and are used to indicate the relationship between the various elements of a sentence.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://japanese.about.com/blparticles.htm | title=Japanese Particles | publisher=About.com | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.timwerx.net/language/particles.htm | title=Japanese Particles | first=Tim R. | last=Matheson | publisher=Tim's Takamatsu | year=2008 | accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref>\n\nUnlike central Japanese dialects, particles in the Kagoshima dialects are bound [[clitic]]s, as they have the effect of resyllabifying the last word they attach to. So, for example, the standard forms {{lang|ja|\u672c\u3092}} ''hon o'' \"book {{gcl|ACC}}\", {{lang|ja|\u66f8\u304d\u3092}} ''kaki o'' \"writing {{gcl|ACC}}\" and {{lang|ja|\u307e\u308a\u3092}} ''mari o'' \"ball {{gcl|ACC}}\" would be realized as {{IPA|/hoNno/}}, {{IPA|/kakjo/}} and {{IPA|/majo/}} ( \u2190 {{IPA|/ma\u027djo/}}) in most of northern and central Kagoshima, and {{IPA|/hoNnu/}}, {{IPA|/kakju/~/kaku/}} and {{IPA|/maju/}} ( \u2190 {{IPA|/ma\u027dju/}}) in parts of Kagoshima's southern mainland.<ref>Shibatani (1990), p. 210</ref>\n\nResyllabification has also led to the reanalysis of some particles in a few dialects. For instance, the topic particle ''(w)a'' has been completely superseded by the form ''na'' in [[Izumi, Kagoshima|Izumi]],<ref name=\"Izumi\">{{cite web | url=http://sky.geocities.jp/ryohusyokyoryu/izumigo.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234707/http://sky.geocities.jp/ryohusyokyoryu/izumigo.html | archivedate=2013-12-02 | script-title=ja:\u5317\u85a9\u51fa\u6c34\u8a9e\u3092\u8a71\u3057\u3066\u307f\u3088\u3046\uff01 | language=Japanese |trans-title=Let's learn the Hokusatsu district Izumi dialect! | accessdate=2012-04-22}}</ref> which in most mainland dialects is merely a variant of ''(w)a'' after a moraic nasal.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Resyllabification rules ==\n\nWhen a word is followed by a particle that starts with a vowel (such as the topic particle {{lang|ja|\u306f}} ''a'', the accusative particle {{lang|ja|\u3092}} ''o'' or the dative particle {{lang|ja|\u3044}} ''i''), the final syllable of that word will be fused with the particle and be subject to Kagoshima's [[kagoshima dialect#Coalescence|vowel coalescence rules]] as well as other sound changes occurring in the regional dialect. As a simple example, when the word {{lang|ja|\u3053\u308c}} {{IPA|/ko\u027de/}} ''kore'' \"this\" is followed by the topic particle {{lang|ja|\u306f}} {{IPA|/a/}}, it becomes {{lang|ja|\u3053\u308a\u3083}} {{IPA|/ko\u027dja/}} ''korya'' \"this={{gcl|TOP}}\". A secondary sound change in Mainland Kagoshima then causes the medial {{IPA|/\u027dj/}} ''ry'' to become {{IPA|/j/}} ''y'', giving the common form {{lang|ja|\u3053\u3084}} {{IPA|/koja/}} ''koya'' \"this={{gcl|TOP}}\".\n\nTwo main exceptions to this rule exist:\n\n# If a word's underlying form ends in a moraic nasal (i.e. {{IPA|/N/}}), an [[Epenthesis|epenthetic]] {{IPA|/n/}} is inserted between the word and the particle. For example, {{lang|ja|\u672c}} {{IPA|/hoN/}} ''hon'' \"book\" becomes {{lang|ja|\u672c\u306f}} {{IPA|/hoNna/}} ''honna'' when fused with the topic particle.\n# If a word's underlying form ends in a long vowel or sequence of vowels, then an epenthetic consonant is sometimes inserted between the word and the topic particle. In the case of topic particle {{lang|ja|\u306f}} ''a'' and the accusative particle {{lang|ja|\u3092}} ''o'', the epenthetic consonant is {{IPA|/w/}}. In the case of the dative particle {{lang|ja|\u3044}} ''i'', the epenthetic consonant is {{IPA|/n/}}.

So in the sentence \"to write ''with'' a brush\", {{lang|ja|\u3067}} ''de'' would be used.<ref name=\"SatoGrammar\" />\n\n(2) In the second, it can be used to mark the agent in an [[Passive voice#Adversative passive|adversative-passive]] sentence, replacing the standard particle {{lang|ja|\u306b}} ''ni''.

Unlike other types of particles such as case particles or conjunctive particles, sentence-final particles do not indicate the [[grammatical relation]] of different elements in a clause. Instead, they can be described as indicating \"the illocutionary force of the proposition as well as the speaker's attitude towards the proposition and/or the interloculor(s)\".<ref>{{cite book | first=Yoko | last=Hasegawa| title=Soliloquy in Japanese and English | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing | year=2010 | isbn=9027256063 | page=41}}</ref> This means that, among other things, sentence-final particles can be used to indicate how true the speaker believes the utterance is (e.g. definitely true, probably true, hearsay, personal opinion, etc.), to express the speaker's personal feelings towards the utterance (e.g. admiration, shock, etc.), or to solicit a reaction from the listener. They can also vary based on the speaker's relation with the listener and the degree of politeness they wish to express.\n\n=== Modality markers ===\n{{see also|Linguistic modality}}\n\n==== (w)ai, (w)a and i ====\nThe particle {{lang|ja|\u3042\u3044}} ''ai'' or more rarely {{lang|ja|\u308f\u3044}} ''wai'' is a sentence-final particle used to emphasize the utterance and to indicate that the speaker is expressing their own view. This particle attaches to the preceding word (typically a verb in its non-past form) and often fuses with the vowel of the final syllable of that word. Functionally, this particle is similar in usage to the particle {{lang|ja|\u3088}} ''yo'' in standard Japanese.

During the middle of the first chorus the rest of the band joins in, with [[Tr\u00e9 Cool]] adding fast tom fills and explosive transitions and [[Mike Dirnt]] adding a bass line that is reminiscent of the vocal melody. In the second verse, \"Basket Case\" references soliciting a male [[prostitute]]; Armstrong noted that \"I wanted to challenge myself and whoever the listener might be. It's also looking at the world and saying, 'It's not as black and white as you think.

It is the seventh track and second single from their third [[studio album]], ''[[Dookie]]'' (1994). The song spent five weeks at the top of Billboard's [[Alternative Songs]] chart.\n\nIn 2001, the song appeared as the fifth track on their greatest hits album, ''[[International Superhits!]]''.\n\n==Origin and recording==\nGreen Day vocalist/guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] said \"Basket Case\" is about his struggle with [[anxiety]]; before he was diagnosed with a [[panic disorder]] years afterward, he thought he was going crazy. Armstrong commented that at the time, \"The only way I could know what the hell was going on was to write a song about it.\"<ref>\"Green Day: ''Dookie''\". ''Ultimate Albums'' [documentary series]. VH1, 2002.</ref>\n\n\"Basket Case\" was one of the songs producer [[Rob Cavallo]] heard when he received Green Day's demo tape. He ended up signing the band to [[Reprise Records]] in mid-1993.<ref>Spitz, p. 83-86</ref> Green Day and Cavallo recorded the version of \"Basket Case\" released on the trio's major label debut ''Dookie'' between September and October 1993 at [[Fantasy Studios]] in [[Berkeley, California]].<ref name=\"SOS\">Buskin, Richard.

Sound On Sound. February 2011. Retrieved on February 3, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\"Basket Case\", like the other songs on ''Dookie'', was performed on instruments tuned down to the pitch of E-flat.<ref name=\"SOS\"/> The introductory verse features only Armstrong and his guitar. During the middle of the first chorus the rest of the band joins in, with [[Tr\u00e9 Cool]] adding fast tom fills and explosive transitions and [[Mike Dirnt]] adding a bass line that is reminiscent of the vocal melody. In the second verse, \"Basket Case\" references soliciting a male [[prostitute]]; Armstrong noted that \"I wanted to challenge myself and whoever the listener might be. It's also looking at the world and saying, 'It's not as black and white as you think. This isn't your grandfather's prostitute \u2013 or maybe it was.'\"<ref name=\"Dookieat20\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dookie-at-20-billie-joe-armstrong-on-green-days-punk-blockbuster-20140203#ixzz3QGvGBb4N|title='Dookie' at 20: Billie Joe Armstrong on Green Day's Punk Blockbuster|last=Fricke|first=David|work=Rolling Stone|date=February 3, 2014|accessdate=January 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209121159/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/dookie-at-20-billie-joe-armstrong-on-green-days-punk-blockbuster-20140203#ixzz3QGvGBb4N|archive-date=February 9, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The song's chord progression closely mirrors that of [[Pachelbel's Canon]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4146352-canon-in-the-1990s--from-spiritualized-to-coolio-regurgitating-pachelbels-canon |title=Canon in the 1990s: From Spiritualized to Coolio, Regurgitating Pachelbel's Canon |last=Chamings |first=Andrew |date=2013-04-30 |website=Drowned In Sound |language=en |access-date=2017-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811073515/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/4146352-canon-in-the-1990s--from-spiritualized-to-coolio-regurgitating-pachelbels-canon |archive-date=August 11, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Basket Case\" was the second single released from ''Dookie'', following \"[[Longview (song)|Longview]]\". \"Basket Case\" peaked at number one on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, a position it maintained for five weeks.<ref name=\"SOS\" /> In 1995, \"Basket Case\" garnered a [[Grammy Award]] nomination in the [[Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group]] category.<ref>Strauss, Neil. \"'94 Grammy Nominations: Not Just the Familiar\".

It was in many ways a revival of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] that was in place from 1870 during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] to 1940 during [[World War II]], and suffered many of the same problems. France adopted the constitution of the Fourth Republic on 13 October 1946.\n\nDespite the political dysfunction, the Fourth Republic saw an era of great [[economic growth]] in France and the rebuilding of the nation's social [[institution]]s and [[industry]] after World War II, through assistance the [[United States]] provided through the [[Marshall Plan]]. It also saw the beginning of the [[rapprochement]] with former longtime enemy [[Germany]], which in turn led to Franco-German co-operation and eventually to the development of the [[European Union]].\n\nSome attempts were also made to strengthen the [[executive (government)|executive branch of government]] to prevent the unstable situation that had existed before the war, but the instability remained and the Fourth Republic saw frequent changes in government \u2013 there were 21 administrations in it's brief twelve-year existence. Moreover, the government proved unable to make effective decisions regarding [[decolonisation]] of the numerous remaining [[List of French possessions and colonies|French colonies]]. After a series of crises, most importantly the [[May 1958 crisis in France|Algerian crisis of 1958]], the Fourth Republic [[french Fifth Republic#Origins|collapsed]]. [[France during World War II|Wartime]] leader [[Charles de Gaulle]] returned from retirement to preside over a transitional administration that was empowered to design a new [[Constitution of France|French constitution]]. The Fourth Republic was dissolved by a public referendum on 5 October 1958 which established the modern-day [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] with a strengthened [[President of France|presidency]].\n\n{{History of France}}\n\n==Founding of the Fourth Republic (1944\u20131954)==\n{{Main|Tripartisme|Third Force (France)}}\nAfter the liberation of France in 1944, the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] was dissolved and the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] ({{lang-fr|Gouvernement provisoire de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise}}, GPRF), also known as the French Committee of National Liberation, was instituted after a unanimous request of the Provisional Consultative Assembly to be properly represented.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Fourth Republic of France|last=Taylor|first=O. R.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1951|asin=B0006DAIX0|location=London|pages=4}}</ref> With most of the political class discredited and containing many members who had more or less collaborated with Nazi Germany, [[Gaullism]] and [[communism]] became the most popular political forces in France.\n\n[[Charles de Gaulle]] led the GPRF from 1944 to 1946. Meanwhile, negotiations took place over the proposed new constitution, which was to be put to a referendum. De{{nbsp}}Gaulle advocated a presidential system of government, and criticized the reinstatement of what he pejoratively called \"the parties system\". He resigned in January 1946 and was replaced by [[Felix Gouin]] of the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] ({{lang|fr|Section fran\u00e7aise de l'Internationale ouvri\u00e8re}}, SFIO). Ultimately only the [[French Communist Party]] ({{lang|fr|Parti communiste fran\u00e7ais}}, PCF) and the socialist SFIO supported the draft constitution, which envisaged a form of government based on [[unicameralism]]; but this was rejected in the [[May 1946 French constitutional referendum|referendum of 5 May 1946]].\n\nFor the [[June 1946 French legislative election|1946 elections]], the [[Rally of Left Republicans]] ({{lang|fr|Rassemblement des gauches r\u00e9publicaines}}, RGR), which encompassed the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]], the [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] and other conservative parties, unsuccessfully attempted to oppose the [[Christian democracy|Christian democrat]] and socialist [[Popular Republican Movement|MRP]]\u2013SFIO\u2013PCF alliance. The new [[constituent assembly]] included 166 MRP deputies, 153 PCF deputies and 128 SFIO deputies, giving the tripartite alliance an absolute majority. [[Georges Bidault]] of the MRP replaced Felix Gouin as the head of government.\n\nA new draft of the Constitution was written, which this time proposed the establishment of a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] form of government. [[Leon Blum]] of the SFIO headed the GPRF from 1946 to 1947. After a new legislative election in June 1946, the Christian democrat Georges Bidault assumed leadership of the [[Government of France|Cabinet]]. Despite De{{nbsp}}Gaulle's so-called [[The Bayeux speeches|discourse of Bayeux]] of 16 June 1946 in which he denounced the new institutions, the new draft was approved by 53% of voters voting in favor (with an abstention rate of 31%) in the [[October 1946 French constitutional referendum|referendum held on 13 October 1946]]. This culminated in the establishment in the following year of the Fourth Republic, an arrangement in which executive power essentially resided in the hands of the [[Prime Minister of France|President of the Council]] (the prime minister). The [[President of France|President of the Republic]] was given a largely symbolic role, although he remained chief of the [[French Army]] and as a last resort could be called upon to resolve conflicts.\n\nAfter the expulsion of the Communists from the governing coalition, France joined the [[Cold War]] against Stalin, as expressed by becoming a founding member of [[NATO]] in April 1949.<ref>John W. Young, ''France, the Cold War and the Western Alliance, 1944\u201349: French foreign policy and post-war Europe'' (1990).</ref> France now took a leadership position in unifying western Europe, working closely with [[Konrad Adenauer]] of West Germany. [[Robert Schuman]], who was twice Prime Minister and at other times Minister of Finance and Foreign Minister, was instrumental in building post-war European and trans-Atlantic institutions. A devout Catholic and anti-Communist, he led France to be a member of the [[European Communities]], the [[Council of Europe]] and NATO.<ref>Alan Fimister, ''Robert Schuman: Neo-Scholastic Humanism and the Reunification of Europe'' (2008)</ref>\n\n==Trente Glorieuses==\n{{main|Les Trente Glorieuses|Economic history of France#From 1944}}\n''Les Trente Glorieuses'' ('The Glorious Thirty') was the high prosperity in the 30 years from 1945 to 1975. In 1944, De{{nbsp}}Gaulle introduced a [[dirigiste]] economic policy, which included substantial state-directed control over a capitalist economy, which was followed by 30 years of unprecedented growth.<ref>Gordon, Daniel A., \"Full Speed Ahead? The Trente Glorieuses in a Rear View Mirror.\" ''Contemporary European History'' 26.1 (2017): 189-199 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0960777316000461.</ref>\n\nThe wartime damage was extensive and expectations of large reparations from defeated Germany did not happen . The United States helped revive the French economy with the [[Marshall Plan]] (1948\u20131951), whereby it gave France $2.3 billion with no repayment. France was the second largest recipient after Britain. The total of all American grants and credits to France from 1946 to 1953, amounted to $4.9 billion.<ref>[[U.S. Bureau of the Census]].

Thus, the mid-1970s marked the end of the period. [[Thomas Piketty]] describes the Trente Glorieuses as an exceptional \"catch up\" period following the world wars. He cites statistics showing that normal growth in wealthy countries is about 1.5\u20132%, whereas in Europe growth dropped to 0.5% between 1913 and 1950, and then \"caught up\" with a growth rate of 4% between 1950 and 1970, until settling back to 1.5\u20132% from 1970 onward.<ref>{{cite book|last=Piketty|first=Thomas|title=Capital in the twenty-first century|date=2014|publisher=Belknap Press|isbn=067443000X|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674430006/page/123 123\u2013125]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674430006/page/123|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n==Indochina and Tunisia==\nPublic opinion polls showed that in February 1954, only 7% of the French people wanted to continue the fight in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] against the Communists, led by [[Ho Chi Minh]] and his [[Viet Minh]] movement.<ref>Maurice Larkin, ''France since the Popular Front: Government and People 1936\u20131996'' (1997) pp 240-1.</ref>\n\n[[Pierre Mendes France]] was a [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] leader who was Prime Minister for eight months in 1954\u201355, working with the support of the Socialist and Communist parties. His top priority was ending the war in Indochina, which had already cost 92,000 dead, 114,000 wounded and 28,000 captured in the wake of the humiliating defeat at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] in early-May 1954.<ref>Martin Windrow, ''The French Indochina War 1946\u201354'' (Osprey Publishing, 2013)</ref>\n\nAt the [[Geneva Conference (1954)]], he made a deal that gave the Viet Minh control of Vietnam north of the seventeenth parallel, and allowed him to pull out all French forces.

[[Minister (government)|Ministers]] were accountable to the legislative body, the [[National Assembly (French Fourth Republic)|French National Assembly]], but some measures were introduced in order to protect the Cabinet and to reinforce the authority of the Prime Minister of France, who led the Cabinet. The goal of the new constitution was to reconcile [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with ministerial stability.\n\nFor instance, under the new Constitution, the President of the Council was the leader of the executive branch (Prime Minister of France). The President of the French Republic, elected by the Parliament (the National Assembly and the [[Council of the Republic (France)|Council of the Republic]]), played a symbolic role. His main power was to propose a Prime Minister, who was subject to election by the National Assembly before forming a Cabinet. Only the Prime Minister could invoke a parliamentary vote on legitimacy of the Cabinet. The Prime Minister was also the only member of the executive able to demand a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of confidence]] from the National Assembly (in the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] any minister could call for a vote of confidence). The Cabinet could be dismissed if an [[supermajority#Majority of the entire membership|absolute majority]] of the National Assembly's members voted against the Cabinet. Finally, the National Assembly could be dissolved after two ministerial crises in the [[legislature]].\n\nHowever, these constitutional measures did not work. In January 1947, after his election by the National Assembly and the nomination of his ministers, Prime Minister [[Paul Ramadier]] called for a vote of confidence in order to verify that the Assembly approved the composition of his Cabinet. This initiated a custom of double election, a vote for the Prime Minister followed by a vote of confidence in the chosen Cabinet, that weakened the Prime Minister's authority over the Cabinet. Cabinets were dismissed with only a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] (not the absolute majority) of the National Assembly voting against the Cabinet. Consequently, these ministerial crises did not result in the dissolution of Parliament. Thus, as in the Third Republic, this regime was characterized by ministerial instability.\n\nThe Fourth Republic was also a victim of the political context. The split of the [[tripartisme|three-party]] alliance in spring 1947, the departure of Communist ministers, [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] [[opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]], and the new [[proportional representation]] did not create conditions for ministerial stability. [[Coalition government|Governmental coalitions]] were composed of an undisciplined patchwork of [[centre-left politics|center-left]] and [[center-right politics|center-right]] parties. Finally, the Fourth Republic was confronted with the collapse of the [[French colonial empire]].\n\n==European countries==\nThe creation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) was first proposed by [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French foreign minister]] [[Robert Schuman]] and French economic theorist [[Jean Monnet]] on 9 May 1950 as a way to prevent further war between France and [[Germany]]. Though the [[United Kingdom]] was invited, its [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]], then preparing for a re-election fight, did not join the initiative.<ref>Dell, Edmund (1995). ''The Schuman Plan and the British Abdication of Leadership in Europe''. Oxford: Clarendon Press. {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}.</ref> It was formally established in 1951 by the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]], signed by France, [[Italy]], [[West Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Between these countries the ECSC would create a [[Single market|common market]] for coal and steel. The ECSC was governed by a 'High Authority', checked by bodies representing governments, [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament]] and an [[judicial independence|independent judiciary]].\n\nThe ECSC was superseded, on 25 March 1957, by the [[Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (which would, in 1993, become the [[European Union]] through the [[Maastricht Treaty]]).\n\n==Algeria and collapse==\nThe trigger for the collapse of the Fourth Republic was the [[May 1958 crisis|Algiers crisis of 1958]]. France was still a colonial power, although conflict and revolt had begun the process of [[decolonization]]. [[French West Africa]], [[French Indochina]], and [[French Algeria]] still sent representatives to the French parliament under systems of limited suffrage in the [[French Union]]. Algeria in particular, despite being the colony with the largest French population, saw rising pressure for separation from the {{lang|fr|[[Metropolitan France|M\u00e9tropole]]}}. The situation was complicated by those in Algeria, such as the [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]], who wanted to stay part of France, so the [[Algerian War]] became not just a [[Separatism|separatist]] movement but had elements of a [[civil war]].\n\nFurther complications came when a section of the French Army rebelled and openly backed the ''{{lang|fr|[[French Algeria#Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise|Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise]]}}'' movement to defeat separation. Revolts and riots broke out in 1958 against the French government in Algiers, but there were no adequate and competent political initiatives by the French government in support of military efforts to end the rebellion owing to party politics. The feeling was widespread that another debacle like that of Indochina in 1954 was in the offing and that the government would order another precipitous pullout and sacrifice French honor to political expediency. This prompted General [[Jacques Massu]] to create a French settlers' committee<ref name=\"JMO\">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article818845.ece Jacques Massu obituary]</ref> to demand the formation of a new national government under General De{{nbsp}}Gaulle, who was a national hero and had advocated a strong military policy, nationalism and the retention of French control over Algeria. General Massu, who had gained prominence and authority when he ruthlessly suppressed Algerian militants, famously declared that unless General De{{nbsp}}Gaulle was returned to power, the French Army would openly revolt; General Massu and other senior generals covertly planned the takeover of Paris with 1,500 paratroopers preparing to take over airports with the support of [[French Air Force]] units.<ref name=\"JMO\"/> Armored units from [[Rambouillet]] prepared to roll into Paris.<ref name=\"crozier\">{{cite journal |last=Crozier |first=Brian |last2=Mansell |first2=Gerard |date=July 1960 |title=France and Algeria |journal=[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]] |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=310\u2013321 |doi=10.2307/2610008 |jstor=2610008}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, French paratroopers from the Algerian corps landed on [[Corsica]], taking the French island in a bloodless action called {{lang|fr|[[Op\u00e9ration Corse]]}}.<ref name=\"JMO\"/><ref name=\"crozier\"/> [[Operation Resurrection]] would be implemented if De{{nbsp}}Gaulle was not approved as leader by the [[French Parliament]], if De{{nbsp}}Gaulle asked for military assistance to take power, or to thwart any organized attempt by the [[French Communist Party]] to seize power or stall De{{nbsp}}Gaulle's return.\n\nDe{{nbsp}}Gaulle, who had announced his retirement from politics a decade before, placed himself in the midst of the crisis, calling on the nation to suspend the government and create a new constitutional system. On 29 May 1958, French politicians agreed upon calling on De{{nbsp}}Gaulle to take over the government as prime minister. The French Army's willingness to support an overthrow of the constitutional government was a significant development in French politics. With Army support, De{{nbsp}}Gaulle's government terminated the Fourth Republic (the last parliament of the Fourth Republic voted for its dissolution) and drew up a new constitution proclaiming the [[French Fifth Republic]] in 1958.\n\n==Prime Ministers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Prime Ministers during the French Fourth Republic\n!

It was in many ways a revival of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] that was in place from 1870 during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] to 1940 during [[World War II]], and suffered many of the same problems. France adopted the constitution of the Fourth Republic on 13 October 1946.\n\nDespite the political dysfunction, the Fourth Republic saw an era of great [[economic growth]] in France and the rebuilding of the nation's social [[institution]]s and [[industry]] after World War II, through assistance the [[United States]] provided through the [[Marshall Plan]]. It also saw the beginning of the [[rapprochement]] with former longtime enemy [[Germany]], which in turn led to Franco-German co-operation and eventually to the development of the [[European Union]].\n\nSome attempts were also made to strengthen the [[executive (government)|executive branch of government]] to prevent the unstable situation that had existed before the war, but the instability remained and the Fourth Republic saw frequent changes in government \u2013 there were 21 administrations in its 12-year history. Moreover, the government proved unable to make effective decisions regarding [[decolonization]] of the numerous remaining [[List of French possessions and colonies|French colonies]]. After a series of crises, most importantly the [[May 1958 crisis in France|Algerian crisis of 1958]], the Fourth Republic [[french Fifth Republic#Origins|collapsed]]. [[France during World War II|Wartime]] leader [[Charles de Gaulle]] returned from retirement to preside over a transitional administration that was empowered to design a new [[Constitution of France|French constitution]]. The Fourth Republic was dissolved by a public referendum on 5 October 1958 which established the modern-day [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] with a strengthened [[President of France|presidency]].\n\n{{History of France}}\n\n==Founding of the Fourth Republic (1944\u20131954)==\n{{Main|Tripartisme|Third Force (France)}}\nAfter the liberation of France in 1944, the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]] was dissolved and the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] ({{lang-fr|Gouvernement provisoire de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise}}, GPRF), also known as the French Committee of National Liberation, was instituted after a unanimous request of the Provisional Consultative Assembly to be properly represented.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Fourth Republic of France|last=Taylor|first=O. R.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1951|asin=B0006DAIX0|location=London|pages=4}}</ref> With most of the political class discredited and containing many members who had more or less collaborated with Nazi Germany, [[Gaullism]] and [[communism]] became the most popular political forces in France.\n\n[[Charles de Gaulle]] led the GPRF from 1944 to 1946. Meanwhile, negotiations took place over the proposed new constitution, which was to be put to a referendum. De{{nbsp}}Gaulle advocated a presidential system of government, and criticized the reinstatement of what he pejoratively called \"the parties system\". He resigned in January 1946 and was replaced by [[Felix Gouin]] of the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] ({{lang|fr|Section fran\u00e7aise de l'Internationale ouvri\u00e8re}}, SFIO). Ultimately only the [[French Communist Party]] ({{lang|fr|Parti communiste fran\u00e7ais}}, PCF) and the socialist SFIO supported the draft constitution, which envisaged a form of government based on [[unicameralism]]; but this was rejected in the [[May 1946 French constitutional referendum|referendum of 5 May 1946]].\n\nFor the [[June 1946 French legislative election|1946 elections]], the [[Rally of Left Republicans]] ({{lang|fr|Rassemblement des gauches r\u00e9publicaines}}, RGR), which encompassed the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]], the [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] and other conservative parties, unsuccessfully attempted to oppose the [[Christian democracy|Christian democrat]] and socialist [[Popular Republican Movement|MRP]]\u2013SFIO\u2013PCF alliance. The new [[constituent assembly]] included 166 MRP deputies, 153 PCF deputies and 128 SFIO deputies, giving the tripartite alliance an absolute majority. [[Georges Bidault]] of the MRP replaced Felix Gouin as the head of government.\n\nA new draft of the Constitution was written, which this time proposed the establishment of a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] form of government. [[Leon Blum]] of the SFIO headed the GPRF from 1946 to 1947. After a new legislative election in June 1946, the Christian democrat Georges Bidault assumed leadership of the [[Government of France|Cabinet]]. Despite De{{nbsp}}Gaulle's so-called [[The Bayeux speeches|discourse of Bayeux]] of 16 June 1946 in which he denounced the new institutions, the new draft was approved by 53% of voters voting in favor (with an abstention rate of 31%) in the [[October 1946 French constitutional referendum|referendum held on 13 October 1946]]. This culminated in the establishment in the following year of the Fourth Republic, an arrangement in which executive power essentially resided in the hands of the [[Prime Minister of France|President of the Council]] (the prime minister). The [[President of France|President of the Republic]] was given a largely symbolic role, although he remained chief of the [[French Army]] and as a last resort could be called upon to resolve conflicts.\n\nAfter the expulsion of the Communists from the governing coalition, France joined the [[Cold War]] against Stalin, as expressed by becoming a founding member of [[NATO]] in April 1949.<ref>John W.

[[Robert Schuman]], who was twice Prime Minister and at other times Minister of Finance and Foreign Minister, was instrumental in building post-war European and trans-Atlantic institutions.

Thus, the mid-1970s marked the end of the period. [[Thomas Piketty]] describes the Trente Glorieuses as an exceptional \"catch up\" period following the world wars. He cites statistics showing that normal growth in wealthy countries is about 1.5\u20132%, whereas in Europe growth dropped to 0.5% between 1913 and 1950, and then \"caught up\" with a growth rate of 4% between 1950 and 1970, until settling back to 1.5\u20132% from 1970 onward.<ref>{{cite book|last=Piketty|first=Thomas|title=Capital in the twenty-first century|date=2014|publisher=Belknap Press|isbn=067443000X|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674430006/page/123 123\u2013125]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780674430006/page/123|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n==Indochina and Tunisia==\nPublic opinion polls showed that in February 1954, only 7% of the French people wanted to continue the fight in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] against the Communists, led by [[Ho Chi Minh]] and his [[Viet Minh]] movement.<ref>Maurice Larkin, ''France since the Popular Front: Government and People 1936\u20131996'' (1997) pp 240-1.</ref>\n\n[[Pierre Mendes France]] was a [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]] leader who was Prime Minister for eight months in 1954\u201355, working with the support of the Socialist and Communist parties.

[[Minister (government)|Ministers]] were accountable to the legislative body, the [[National Assembly (French Fourth Republic)|French National Assembly]], but some measures were introduced in order to protect the Cabinet and to reinforce the authority of the Prime Minister of France, who led the Cabinet. The goal of the new constitution was to reconcile [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] with ministerial stability.\n\nFor instance, under the new Constitution, the President of the Council was the leader of the executive branch (Prime Minister of France). The President of the French Republic, elected by the Parliament (the National Assembly and the [[Council of the Republic (France)|Council of the Republic]]), played a symbolic role. His main power was to propose a Prime Minister, who was subject to election by the National Assembly before forming a Cabinet. Only the Prime Minister could invoke a parliamentary vote on legitimacy of the Cabinet. The Prime Minister was also the only member of the executive able to demand a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of confidence]] from the National Assembly (in the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] any minister could call for a vote of confidence). The Cabinet could be dismissed if an [[supermajority#Majority of the entire membership|absolute majority]] of the National Assembly's members voted against the Cabinet. Finally, the National Assembly could be dissolved after two ministerial crises in the [[legislature]].\n\nHowever, these constitutional measures did not work. In January 1947, after his election by the National Assembly and the nomination of his ministers, Prime Minister [[Paul Ramadier]] called for a vote of confidence in order to verify that the Assembly approved the composition of his Cabinet. This initiated a custom of double election, a vote for the Prime Minister followed by a vote of confidence in the chosen Cabinet, that weakened the Prime Minister's authority over the Cabinet. Cabinets were dismissed with only a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] (not the absolute majority) of the National Assembly voting against the Cabinet. Consequently, these ministerial crises did not result in the dissolution of Parliament. Thus, as in the Third Republic, this regime was characterized by ministerial instability.\n\nThe Fourth Republic was also a victim of the political context. The split of the [[tripartisme|three-party]] alliance in spring 1947, the departure of Communist ministers, [[Gaullism|Gaullist]] [[opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]], and the new [[proportional representation]] did not create conditions for ministerial stability. [[Coalition government|Governmental coalitions]] were composed of an undisciplined patchwork of [[centre-left politics|center-left]] and [[center-right politics|center-right]] parties. Finally, the Fourth Republic was confronted with the collapse of the [[French colonial empire]].\n\n==European countries==\nThe creation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) was first proposed by [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French foreign minister]] [[Robert Schuman]] and French economic theorist [[Jean Monnet]] on 9 May 1950 as a way to prevent further war between France and [[Germany]]. Though the [[United Kingdom]] was invited, its [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]], then preparing for a re-election fight, did not join the initiative.<ref>Dell, Edmund (1995). ''The Schuman Plan and the British Abdication of Leadership in Europe''. Oxford: Clarendon Press. {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}.</ref> It was formally established in 1951 by the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]], signed by France, [[Italy]], [[West Germany]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Between these countries the ECSC would create a [[Single market|common market]] for coal and steel. The ECSC was governed by a 'High Authority', checked by bodies representing governments, [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament]] and an [[judicial independence|independent judiciary]].\n\nThe ECSC was superseded, on 25 March 1957, by the [[Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (which would, in 1993, become the [[European Union]] through the [[Maastricht Treaty]]).\n\n==Algeria and collapse==\nThe trigger for the collapse of the Fourth Republic was the [[May 1958 crisis|Algiers crisis of 1958]]. France was still a colonial power, although conflict and revolt had begun the process of [[decolonization]]. [[French West Africa]], [[French Indochina]], and [[French Algeria]] still sent representatives to the French parliament under systems of limited suffrage in the [[French Union]]. Algeria in particular, despite being the colony with the largest French population, saw rising pressure for separation from the {{lang|fr|[[Metropolitan France|M\u00e9tropole]]}}. The situation was complicated by those in Algeria, such as the [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]], who wanted to stay part of France, so the [[Algerian War]] became not just a [[Separatism|separatist]] movement but had elements of a [[civil war]].\n\nFurther complications came when a section of the French Army rebelled and openly backed the ''{{lang|fr|[[French Algeria#Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise|Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise]]}}'' movement to defeat separation. Revolts and riots broke out in 1958 against the French government in Algiers, but there were no adequate and competent political initiatives by the French government in support of military efforts to end the rebellion owing to party politics. The feeling was widespread that another debacle like that of Indochina in 1954 was in the offing and that the government would order another precipitous pullout and sacrifice French honor to political expediency. This prompted General [[Jacques Massu]] to create a French settlers' committee<ref name=\"JMO\">[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article818845.ece Jacques Massu obituary]</ref> to demand the formation of a new national government under General De{{nbsp}}Gaulle, who was a national hero and had advocated a strong military policy, nationalism and the retention of French control over Algeria. General Massu, who had gained prominence and authority when he ruthlessly suppressed Algerian militants, famously declared that unless General De{{nbsp}}Gaulle was returned to power, the French Army would openly revolt; General Massu and other senior generals covertly planned the takeover of Paris with 1,500 paratroopers preparing to take over airports with the support of [[French Air Force]] units.<ref name=\"JMO\"/> Armored units from [[Rambouillet]] prepared to roll into Paris.<ref name=\"crozier\">{{cite journal |last=Crozier |first=Brian |last2=Mansell |first2=Gerard |date=July 1960 |title=France and Algeria |journal=[[International Affairs (journal)|International Affairs]] |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=310\u2013321 |doi=10.2307/2610008 |jstor=2610008}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, French paratroopers from the Algerian corps landed on [[Corsica]], taking the French island in a bloodless action called {{lang|fr|[[Op\u00e9ration Corse]]}}.<ref name=\"JMO\"/><ref name=\"crozier\"/> [[Operation Resurrection]] would be implemented if De{{nbsp}}Gaulle was not approved as leader by the [[French Parliament]], if De{{nbsp}}Gaulle asked for military assistance to take power, or to thwart any organized attempt by the [[French Communist Party]] to seize power or stall De{{nbsp}}Gaulle's return.\n\nDe{{nbsp}}Gaulle, who had announced his retirement from politics a decade before, placed himself in the midst of the crisis, calling on the nation to suspend the government and create a new constitutional system. On 29 May 1958, French politicians agreed upon calling on De{{nbsp}}Gaulle to take over the government as prime minister. The French Army's willingness to support an overthrow of the constitutional government was a significant development in French politics. With Army support, De{{nbsp}}Gaulle's government terminated the Fourth Republic (the last parliament of the Fourth Republic voted for its dissolution) and drew up a new constitution proclaiming the [[French Fifth Republic]] in 1958.\n\n==Prime Ministers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Prime Ministers during the French Fourth Republic\n!
