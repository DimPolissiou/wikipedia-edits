He [[news presenter|anchored]] a nightly newscast and occasionally ventured to far-flung locations to report on national and international stories, taking with him his own [[Bell and Howell]] movie camera with which he shot his own news footage. With him on KNXT's newscasts in that time were three other Los Angeles television stalwarts, anchor and reporter [[Bill Stout]], weather forecaster [[Bill Keene]] and sports reporter [[Gil Stratton]] (who at the time also doubled as a radio, television and movie actor).\n\n===KTLA Channel 5===\nRoberts left KNXT in 1959 and joined Los Angeles station [[KTLA]] Channel 5 as news director and primary anchor, along with news producer/director Julian Macdonald, virtually remaking that independent station's news operation.

Roberts contributed news and feature reports and anchored the weekend newscasts. Early in 1974 he once again left KNXT for KTLA and took over the station's hour-long 10 p.m. newscasts. After two years Roberts decided to step back from nightly television news and left KTLA; after a hiatus he joined then-[[PBS]] member television station [[KCET]], contributing feature reports and commentaries. His long tenure in Los Angeles comprised reports and travels ranging from offbeat local stories to the war in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. According to the book Helter Skelter, the young son of a neighbor of Roberts found what turned out to be the .22 Buntline revolver wielded by Manson Family member Tex Watson the night of actress Sharon Tate's and her houseguests' murders, and it was turned over to the police.  As details of the crime came out in the weeks that followed, the boy's father made several calls to the police, suggesting that the missing murder weapon was the same broken, long-barreled gun his son had found. Finally, fed up with months of being ignored by the LAPD, he asked Clete Roberts to intervene in December 1969.

He interviewed on camera several of the actual townspeople of [[Phenix City, Alabama]], who had been witness to the events there in the 1930s, '40s and early '50s.\n\nRoberts portrayed reporters in various productions, among them, ''[[Meteor (film)|Meteor]]''  from 1979, the 1983 NBC miniseries ''[[V (1983 miniseries)|V]]'', as well a San Francisco television newsman in the 1983 nuclear war film ''[[Testament (1983 film)|Testament]]''.\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nThe [[Associated Press Television and Radio Association]] of [[California]], [[Nevada]], and [[Hawaii]] has established a $1,500 scholarship in Roberts' memory.{{cn|date=September 2015}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n* {{IMDb name|0730950}}\n* {{Find a Grave|1365}}\n\n{{Vietnam War correspondents}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Roberts, Clete}}\n[[Category:1912 births]]\n[[Category:1984 deaths]]\n[[Category:American radio reporters and correspondents]]\n[[Category:American television reporters and correspondents]]\n[[Category:American war correspondents]]\n[[Category:American war correspondents of the Vietnam War]]\n[[Category:American male journalists]]\n[[Category:Journalists from California]]\n[[Category:Journalists from Portland, Oregon]]\n[[Category:Television anchors from Los Angeles]]\n[[Category:20th-century American journalists]]\n[[Category:Burials at Valley Oaks Memorial Park]]\n", "name_user": "Grammarspellchecker", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eActing career", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clete_Roberts"}

They played a repertoire of [[Rock music|rock]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[folk music]]. They had chart and concert success around the world, especially in [[Germany]], the [[Benelux countries]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. They have sold over 20 million albums since the early 1980s. The Kelly Family was ranked as the 6th most popular music act in Germany in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=(www.dw.com)|first1=Deutsche Welle|title=PopXport Ranking: The Top 10 music acts of the 90s from Germany {{!}} PopXport {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 09.12.2016|url=http://www.dw.com/en/popxport-ranking-the-top-10-music-acts-of-the-90s-from-germany/a-18576155|website=DW.COM|accessdate=26 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>  Despite its American origins, the group is virtually unknown in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Keeping it Kelly\">{{cite web|title=Keeping it Kelly|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/keeping-it-kelly-1.1526559|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>\nThey sang in [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]] and [[Basque language|Basque]].\n\nFor many years, the group presented a ragamuffin image and a [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonding]] lifestyle, travelling around Europe in a [[double-decker bus]] and [[houseboat]]. Their image was enhanced by their eclectic and often homemade clothing, and the very long hair worn by both male and female members of the band. The Kelly Family began to break up in 2000 and afterwards they performed mostly as individuals or sub-sets of the full group and took on a more [[mainstream]] look.\n\n==The Kelly Kids==\nThe patriarch of the family, Daniel Kelly Sr., has been described as a \"grizzled, ageing [[druid]] aesthetic\", but according to his daughter Kathy he was in earlier days \"a clean-cut, intense conservative Catholic\" who studied for the priesthood.  He married his first wife, Joanne, in 1957, and the couple left their native United States in 1965 with their children Daniel Jr., Caroline, Kathleen and Paul, and settled in [[Spain]], where Daniel opened an antiques shop.{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n\nDaniel Kelly and Joanne separated, and Joanne returned to the US with Daniel Jr., who had a disability.{{cn|date=March 2017}} In 1970, Kelly married Barbara Ann Suokko. Daniel and Barbara had eight children, with the eldest, John, born in 1967, and the youngest, Angelo in 1981. The children were [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] and given lessons in music and dance.\n\nIn 1974, the older children, Caroline, Daniel, Kathy and Paul, formed '''The Kelly Kids''', at first [[busking]], then performing at parties and local events. They became well-known enough that they appeared on Spanish television in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Kelly Family - Biografie|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918205555/http://www.kellyfamily.de/bio_e.php|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=18 September 2007}}</ref> The band was joined by the younger members of the family as they matured and learned to play musical instruments.  The band's popularity increased in Spain, with several performances on television and in circuses. In 1976, they went on tour as The Kelly Family, in Italy, Germany and The Netherlands. Their money was stolen during the tour and, penniless, they had to busk on the streets to earn enough for the return trip home.<ref name=\"Keeping it Kelly\" />\n\nThe family moved to Ireland, living at a campground and touring there in 1977. Then, in 1978, they toured again in their hallmark [[double-decker bus]].{{cn|date=March 2017}}  (They later lived on a large houseboat.)<ref name=\"Keeping it Kelly\" /> Daniel and Barbara Kelly joined their children for performances, Barbara often performing with a baby in her arms.\n\nIn 1977, they landed a record contract in Germany. Their first major chart hit came in 1980, with the song \"[[Who'll Come With Me (David's Song)]]\", with John Kelly, aged 12, singing the solo. The song, with a [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] melody by [[Vladimir Cosma]], was the theme to a German television production ''[[The Adventures of David Balfour]]'', based on ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The song hit number 1 in the Netherlands and [[Belgium]], and it reached the top 20 in Germany.\n\nBarbara Kelly died of [[breast cancer]] in 1982, shortly after the birth of the youngest child, Angelo. Her last words to her family were \"Keep on singing!\"{{cn|date=March 2017}} The band continued to record, Daniel Kelly having formed his own recording company in 1980. As the older members of the family reached adulthood, Caroline and Paul left the band, Caroline to study nursing and Paul to become a chef. In 1990, Daniel Kelly suffered a [[stroke]], but he remained fairly active in the group through the 1990s.\n\n==Fame==\nThe Kelly Family covered famous songs such as \"[[We are the World]]\" and \"[[The Rose (song)|The Rose]]\", but wrote most of their own music based on family and personal experience, their [[Catholicism|Catholic]] faith, and their worldview.  Songs include \"Santa Maria\"; \"Why, Why, Why\"; \"An Angel\", the video of which popularized a younger family member Paddy; \"Break Free\", sung by Barby; the haunting \"Mama\", in which Barbara Kelly is remembered by her children; and \"The Pee Pee Song\", in which the common childhood problem of [[bedwetting]] is portrayed by the raucous, flaxen haired baby-of-the-family Angelo.\n\nIn the 1990s, the group enjoyed their biggest success. Their 1994 album ''[[Over the Hump]]'' sold more than 2.25 million copies in Germany alone, and 4.5 million copies throughout Europe. In 1995, to promote the album, they played a concert to a [[Vienna]] audience of 250,000. In the same year they filled the [[Westfalenhalle]], [[Dortmund]], nine times in a row, a feat no other musician has since accomplished. In 1996 they headlined their first Stadium Tour, filling some of Europe's largest venues. They played in [[Beijing]], [[China]] in front of 20,000 people. In 1998 they bought a castle, Schloss Gymnich, on the [[Erft]] near [[Cologne]], Germany. About the same time, Adam Kelly, son of Papa Kelly\u2019s younger brother Henry, started performing with his cousins in The Kelly Family.{{cn|date=March 2017}} Success continued until they started to disagree on a professional basis at the beginning of the year 2000. In 2002 Papa Kelly died from yet another stroke. That same year the family competed in the German [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song of Maite Kelly \"I wanna be loved\" and placed fourth.\n\nIn 2002, Barby's ongoing illness forced her retirement from the band and, to the disappointment of his fans, Paddy cut his long hair and joined a religious order in France.  Members of the family continued to perform as soloists or together, or in combination with their partners, as both [[Jimmy Kelly (singer)|Jimmy]] and John married singers.  Fan interest prompted a comeback with gigs in Germany in 2007.\n\nIn 2011, the 12 Kelly siblings were reported as living in Ireland, Germany, the United States, Spain, and Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bio Angelo|url=http://alwaystkf.weebly.com/bio-angelo.html|website=~ Always The Kelly Family ~|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies and problems==\n\nAlong with their fame and rabid followers came problems.  The father, Daniel Kelly, was described, allegedly by his children, as having a \"tyrannical, controlling streak\".  The most outspoken sibling, Jimmy, has criticized his father for not giving his children a formal education and imposing on them a \"Huckleberry Finn\" lifestyle.  Moreover, he said that as The Kelly Family group began to dissolve, he had almost nothing left of the millions of dollars the family had earned. The oldest daughter, Kathy, who managed most of the finances of the family, said that Daniel was more \"free spirit than tyrant\" but that \"we got too big too fast, we should have cut things down some or handed over to professional management.\"<ref name=\"Keeping it Kelly\" />\n\nDan Kelly taught his children to \"always keep independent of the structures of the modern entertainment industry.\"<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\">{{cite web|title=The man who turned his musical children into recording sensations|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/the-man-who-turned-his-musical-children-into-recording-sensations-1.1091592|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>  He formed his own record label and \"the Kellys kept everything in the family, from copyright and bookings to promotion and money matters.\"<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\"/>\n\nThe Kellys ran into tax problems in Germany, the \"Dan Kelly Foundation\" was discovered not to be a registered charity, and they were criticized for their lack of transparency in accounting for money raised for an [[AIDS]] charity.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\"/>  Likewise, the group had little success in the English-speaking world and aroused the derision of critics.

They played a repertoire of [[Rock music|rock]], [[pop music|pop]], and [[folk music]]. They had chart and concert success around the world, especially in [[Germany]], the [[Benelux countries]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. They have sold over 20 million albums since the early 1980s. The Kelly Family was ranked as the 6th most popular music act in Germany in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=(www.dw.com)|first1=Deutsche Welle|title=PopXport Ranking: The Top 10 music acts of the 90s from Germany {{!}} PopXport {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 09.12.2016|url=http://www.dw.com/en/popxport-ranking-the-top-10-music-acts-of-the-90s-from-germany/a-18576155|website=DW.COM|accessdate=26 March 2017|language=en}}</ref>  Despite its American origins, the group is virtually unknown in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Keeping it Kelly\">{{cite web|title=Keeping it Kelly|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/keeping-it-kelly-1.1526559|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>\nThey sang in [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]] and [[Basque language|Basque]].\n\nFor many years, the group presented a ragamuffin image and a [[Vagabond (person)|vagabonding]] lifestyle, travelling around Europe in a [[double-decker bus]] and [[houseboat]]. Their image was enhanced by their eclectic and often homemade clothing, and the very long hair worn by both male and female members of the band. The Kelly Family began to break up in 2000 and afterwards they performed mostly as individuals or sub-sets of the full group and took on a more [[mainstream]] look.\n\n==The Kelly Kids==\nThe patriarch of the family, Daniel Kelly Sr., has been described as a \"grizzled, ageing [[druid]] aesthetic\", but according to his daughter Kathy he was in earlier days \"a clean-cut, intense conservative Catholic\" who studied for the priesthood.  He married his first wife, Joanne, in 1957, and the couple left their native United States in 1965 with their children Daniel Jr., Caroline, Kathleen and Paul, and settled in [[Spain]], where Daniel opened an antiques shop.{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n\nDaniel Kelly and Joanne separated, and Joanne returned to the US with Daniel Jr., who had a disability.{{cn|date=March 2017}} In 1970, Kelly married Barbara Ann Suokko. Daniel and Barbara had eight children, with the eldest, John, born in 1967, and the youngest, Angelo in 1981. The children were [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] and given lessons in music and dance.\n\nIn 1974, the older children, Caroline, Daniel, Kathy and Paul, formed '''The Kelly Kids''', at first [[busking]], then performing at parties and local events. They became well-known enough that they appeared on Spanish television in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Kelly Family - Biografie|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918205555/http://www.kellyfamily.de/bio_e.php|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=18 September 2007}}</ref> The band was joined by the younger members of the family as they matured and learned to play musical instruments.  The band's popularity increased in Spain, with several performances on television and in circuses. In 1976, they went on tour as The Kelly Family, in Italy, Germany and The Netherlands. Their money was stolen during the tour and, penniless, they had to busk on the streets to earn enough for the return trip home.<ref name=\"Keeping it Kelly\" />\n\nThe family moved to Ireland, living at a campground and touring there in 1977. Then, in 1978, they toured again in their hallmark [[double-decker bus]].{{cn|date=March 2017}}  (They later lived on a large houseboat.)<ref name=\"Keeping it Kelly\" /> Daniel and Barbara Kelly joined their children for performances, Barbara often performing with a baby in her arms.\n\nIn 1977, they landed a record contract in Germany. Their first major chart hit came in 1980, with the song \"[[Who'll Come With Me (David's Song)]]\", with John Kelly, aged 12, singing the solo. The song, with a [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] melody by [[Vladimir Cosma]], was the theme to a German television production ''[[The Adventures of David Balfour]]'', based on ''[[Kidnapped (novel)|Kidnapped]]'' by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The song hit number 1 in the Netherlands and [[Belgium]], and it reached the top 20 in Germany.\n\nBarbara Kelly died of [[breast cancer]] in 1982, shortly after the birth of the youngest child, Angelo. Her last words to her family were \"Keep on singing!\"{{cn|date=March 2017}} The band continued to record, Daniel Kelly having formed his own recording company in 1980. As the older members of the family reached adulthood, Caroline and Paul left the band, Caroline to study nursing and Paul to become a chef. In 1990, Daniel Kelly suffered a [[stroke]], but he remained fairly active in the group through the 1990s.\n\n==Fame==\nThe Kelly Family covered famous songs such as \"[[We are the World]]\" and \"[[The Rose (song)|The Rose]]\", but wrote most of their own music based on family and personal experience, their [[Catholicism|Catholic]] faith, and their worldview.  Songs include \"Santa Maria\"; \"Why, Why, Why\"; \"An Angel\", the video of which popularized a younger family member Paddy; \"Break Free\", sung by Barby; the haunting \"Mama\", in which Barbara Kelly is remembered by her children; and \"The Pee Pee Song\", in which the common childhood problem of [[bedwetting]] is portrayed by the raucous, flaxen haired baby-of-the-family Angelo.\n\nIn the 1990s, the group enjoyed their biggest success. Their 1994 album ''[[Over the Hump]]'' sold more than 2.25 million copies in Germany alone, and 4.5 million copies throughout Europe. In 1995, to promote the album, they played a concert to a [[Vienna]] audience of 250,000. In the same year they filled the [[Westfalenhalle]], [[Dortmund]], nine times in a row, a feat no other musician has since accomplished. In 1996 they headlined their first Stadium Tour, filling some of Europe's largest venues. They played in [[Beijing]], [[China]] in front of 20,000 people. In 1998 they bought a castle, Schloss Gymnich, on the [[Erft]] near [[Cologne]], Germany. About the same time, Adam Kelly, son of Papa Kelly\u2019s younger brother Henry, started performing with his cousins in The Kelly Family.{{cn|date=March 2017}} Success continued until they started to disagree on a professional basis at the beginning of the year 2000. In 2002 Papa Kelly died from yet another stroke. That same year the family competed in the German [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song of Maite Kelly \"I wanna be loved\" and placed fourth.\n\nIn 2002, Barby's ongoing illness forced her retirement from the band and, to the disappointment of his fans, Paddy cut his long hair and joined a religious order in France.  Members of the family continued to perform as soloists or together, or in combination with their partners, as both [[Jimmy Kelly (singer)|Jimmy]] and John married singers.  Fan interest prompted a comeback with gigs in Germany in 2007.\n\nIn 2011, the 12 Kelly siblings were reported as living in Ireland, Germany, the United States, Spain, and Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bio Angelo|url=http://alwaystkf.weebly.com/bio-angelo.html|website=~ Always The Kelly Family ~|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies and problems==\n\nAlong with their fame and rabid followers came problems.  The father, Daniel Kelly, was described, allegedly by his children, as having a \"tyrannical, controlling streak\".  The most outspoken sibling, Jimmy, has criticized his father for not giving his children a formal education and imposing on them a \"Huckleberry Finn\" lifestyle.  Moreover, he said that as The Kelly Family group began to dissolve, he had almost nothing left of the millions of dollars the family had earned. The oldest daughter, Kathy, who managed most of the finances of the family, said that Daniel was more \"free spirit than tyrant\" but that \"we got too big too fast, we should have cut things down some or handed over to professional management.\"<ref name=\"Keeping it Kelly\" />\n\nDan Kelly taught his children to \"always keep independent of the structures of the modern entertainment industry.\"<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\">{{cite web|title=The man who turned his musical children into recording sensations|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/the-man-who-turned-his-musical-children-into-recording-sensations-1.1091592|website=The Irish Times|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>  He formed his own record label and \"the Kellys kept everything in the family, from copyright and bookings to promotion and money matters.\"<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\"/>\n\nThe Kellys ran into tax problems in Germany, the \"Dan Kelly Foundation\" was discovered not to be a registered charity, and they were criticized for their lack of transparency in accounting for money raised for an [[AIDS]] charity.<ref name=\"irishtimes.com\"/>  Likewise, the group had little success in the English-speaking world and aroused the derision of critics.
