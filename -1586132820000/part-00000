There were six in total, and one of them was U\u017eice. The protocols, signed by the ruling prince [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]], also stipulated that the abandoned fortresses had to be demolished and made unusable for any future military purpose.

It was isolated and well fortified, with ramparts including the ''[[donjon]]''. The other, lower part of the town, was encircled by the walls which descended along the ridge's edge all the way to the river. On its bank, there was a [[water tower]], which supplied the town.<ref name=SANU/> The town is divided in three sections: upper town, middle town and lower (or water) town. Although the smallest, the upper town is the most visible.<ref name=vekovi/>\n\nThe entrance into the fort is located on the northwest side. The inner space directly from the entrance was a fortified [[outer bailey]]. South of the entrance there are remains of the ''lagums'', underground rooms. There are two of them, embedded into the rock and interconnected. They served as the shelter and a weapons magazine.<ref name=SANU/>\n\nThe ramparts elevate up to {{convert|80|m|abbr=on}} above the river. The upper town was connected to the lowest section at the \u0110etinja bank with 168 steps.

As a result, Baku played a great role in many branches of the Soviet life. Since about 1921, the city was headed by the Baku City Executive Committee, commonly known in Russian as ''Bakgorispolkom''. Together with the Baku Party Committee (known as the ''Baksovet''), it developed the economic significance of the Caspian metropolis. From 1922 to 1930, Baku was the venue for one of the major [[Trade fair]]s of the Soviet Union, serving as a commercial bridgehead to Iran and the Middle East.<ref>Etienne Forestier-Peyrat, \u2033[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ab_imperio/summary/v2013/2013.4.forestier-peyrat.html Red Passage to Iran: The Baku Trade Fair and the Unmaking of the Azerbaijani Borderland, 1922\u20131930]\u2033, ''Ab Imperio'', Vol 2013, Issue 4, pp. 79\u2013112.</ref>\n\nOn 8 February 1924, the first tram line and two years later the electric railway Baku-Surakhany\u2014the first in the USSR\u2014started to operate.\n\nWhile being in Baku in May 1925 Russian poet [[Sergei Yesenin]] wrote a verse \"Farewell to Baku\":\n\n{{quote|Farewell to Baku!

Bullitt, dispatched a telegram to [[Washington DC|Washington]] concerning \"the possibilities of bombing and demolition of Baku\" which were being discussed in [[Paris]] at the time. [[Charles de Gaulle]] was extremely critical of the plan according to both his wartime and postwar statements. Such ideas, he believed, were made by some \"crazy heads that were thinking more of how to destroy Baku than of resisting Berlin\". In his report submitted on 22 February 1940, to French Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Daladier]], General [[Maurice Gamelin]] believed the Soviets would fall into crisis if those resources were lost. However, during the [[Soviet-German War]], ten defense zones were built around the city to prevent possible German invasion,<ref>Werth, Alexander.

This increased the revenues and decreased the fraud. Even so, this system provoked many protests among merchants in the private sector.\n* The '''modernization of the Navy'''. According to Ensenada, a powerful navy was fundamental to power of an overseas empire and aspirations of being respected by France and Great Britain. He increased the navy's budget and expanded the capacity of the shipyards of [[C\u00e1diz]], [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] and [[Havana]] which marked a commitment to extending the naval policies already underway in his predecessor's reign.\n* '''Church relations''' which were really tense from start of the reign of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] because of the recognition of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] as the King of Spain by the Pope. A regalist policy was maintained that pursued as much political as fiscal objectives and whose decisive achievement was the Concord of 1753. From this the right of Universal Patronage was obtained from [[Pope Benedict XIV]], giving important economic benefits to the Crown and a great control over the clergy.\n* '''Cultural advancement'''.

By the [[High Middle Ages]] the Lords of Schweinsberg-Attinghausen had built their ancestral castle above the village.  The remains of possibly four other [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthen fortifications]] have been discovered around the area.  Though the Schweinsberg-Attinghausen castle fell into ruins in 13th or 14th century, the village with [[Alt-Signau Castle|Alt-]] and [[Neu-Signau Castle]]s (today in [[Bowil]] municipality) formed the center of the ''[[Herrschaft (territory)|Herrschaft]]'' of Signau.  The Barons of Signau built St. Mary's Church in Signau as the [[parish church]] for the [[parish]].  In 1529 the city of [[Bern]] acquired the village and ''Herrschaft'' of Signau.  In 1648, the village of [[Eggiwil]] left the Signau parish to form its own parish and eventually it politically split to become an independent municipality.  The village church was renovated and rebuilt in 1850.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nBy 1622 Signau had a yearly market in the fall.  Two other yearly markets were added in the 18th century.  By 1800 the town was home to a number of industries and businesses in addition to the farmers and livestock herders who lived there.  In 1856 the Sch\u00fcpbach canal drained the swampy valley floor and opened up additional farm land.  In 1864 the Bern-[[Langnau im Emmental|Langnau]] railroad connected Signau to the growing Swiss rail network.  The first line was followed in 1875 by the Langnau-[[Lucerne]] line.  The good rail and road connections encouraged industry to settle in the town.  By 2005, agriculture provided about one-third of all jobs in the community.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThere are several primary schools scattered around the municipality in H\u00f6he, H\u00e4leschwand, Mutten and Sch\u00fcpbach.

By the [[High Middle Ages]] the Lords of Schweinsberg-Attinghausen had built their ancestral castle above the village.  The remains of possibly four other [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthen fortifications]] have been discovered around the area.  Though the Schweinsberg-Attinghausen castle fell into ruins in 13th or 14th century, the village with [[Alt-Signau Castle|Alt-]] and [[Neu-Signau Castle]]s (today in [[Bowil]] municipality) formed the center of the ''[[Herrschaft (territory)|Herrschaft]]'' of Signau.  The Barons of Signau built St. Mary's Church in Signau as the [[parish church]] for the [[parish]].  In 1529 the city of [[Bern]] acquired the village and ''Herrschaft'' of Signau.  In 1648, the village of [[Eggiwil]] left the Signau parish to form its own parish and eventually it politically split to become an independent municipality.  The village church was renovated and rebuilt in 1850.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nBy 1622 Signau had a yearly market in the fall.  Two other yearly markets were added in the 18th century.  By 1800 the town was home to a number of industries and businesses in addition to the farmers and livestock herders who lived there.  In 1856 the Sch\u00fcpbach canal drained the swampy valley floor and opened up additional farm land.  In 1864 the Bern-[[Langnau im Emmental|Langnau]] railroad connected Signau to the growing Swiss rail network.  The first line was followed in 1875 by the Langnau-[[Lucerne]] line.  The good rail and road connections encouraged industry to settle in the town.  By 2005, agriculture provided about one-third of all jobs in the community.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThere are several primary schools scattered around the municipality in H\u00f6he, H\u00e4leschwand, Mutten and Sch\u00fcpbach.

The hand-list and its addenda and corrigenda describes 129 books, mostly printed in Germany, Italy and France, although examples from the Netherlands and England were also listed. Scholderer noted that some of the forty-five books printed in France, particularly those in the vernacular, were very rare.<ref name=Scholderer />\n\n==== Sixteenth-century imprints ====\nThere are approximately 2,500 sixteenth-century European imprints in the Library.
