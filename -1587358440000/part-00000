It stars [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Judy Greer]], and [[Laurence Fishburne]].\n\n''Where'd You Go, Bernadette'' was released on August 16, 2019, by [[Annapurna Pictures]] through their [[United Artists Releasing]] joint venture. It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nArchitect-turned-recluse Bernadette Fox ([[Cate Blanchett]]) is settled down with her husband Elgin ([[Billy Crudup]]) and their daughter Bee ([[Emma Nelson]]) in a dilapidated former schoolhouse in [[Seattle]]. Bernadette hates people, hates leaving the house, hates Seattle, and more than anything, she hates the other parents at her 15-year-old daughter Bee's school. This includes her neighbor Audrey Griffin ([[Kristen Wiig]]).\n\nDespite her misanthropic behavior, Bernadette is exceptionally close to Bee and reluctantly agrees to go on a family vacation to [[Antarctica]] at Bee's request. Bernadette starts to behave oddly, concerning everyone. She uses a cocktail of prescription drugs to control her anxiety and insomnia, which grows worse as the Antarctica trip nears. Her feud with Audrey grows more intense; at one point Audrey accuses Bernadette of running over her foot while speeding away in her car. Later on, the hillside above Audrey's home which Bernadette had cleared of invasive blackberries subsides into Audrey's garden and house during heavy rain. Although she insists that she was only complying with Audrey's request, Elgin accuses architect Bernadette of knowing that the hill would collapse without the blackberries to hold it in place.\n\nBernadette has a personal assistant named Manjula in India with whom she regularly communicates. One day, she finds Elgin, Dr. Kurtz ([[Judy Greer]]), and an FBI agent at her home for an intervention. They tell her that Manjula is a front for a Russian criminal operation which has Bernadette\u2019s personal information and is planning to defraud her family. Elgin wants Bernadette to go with Dr. Kurtz to a mental hospital to seek treatment, which horrifies her. She sneaks out of the house and finds refuge with Audrey, whom she makes amends with. With Audrey's help, Bernadette flies to Antarctica. Elgin and Bee follow in hot pursuit, after the FBI agent tells them that the Russian criminal has been arrested and is no longer a threat.\n\nIn Antarctica, Bernadette befriends a scientist and learns that the research station at the South Pole is going to be completely rebuilt and will need an architect. She smuggles herself off her cruise ship and onto [[Palmer Station]], where she convinces the team leader ([[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]]) to give her a spot on the next convoy to the South Pole. Meanwhile, Elgin comes to the realization that he has failed his wife in not supporting her. He and Bee catch up with her at the station, and realizing that her passion and creativity have been reignited, give their permission to her to make the 5-week trip.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Bernadette Fox\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as Elgin Branch\n* Emma Nelson as Bee Branch\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Audrey Griffin\n* [[James Urbaniak]] as Marcus Strang\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Dr. Janelle Kurtz\n* [[Troian Bellisario]] as Becky\n* [[Zo\u00eb Chao]] as Soo-Lin Lee-Segal\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Paul Jellinek\n* [[Claudia Doumit]] as Iris\n* Katelyn Statton as Vivian\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as David Walker\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Judy Toll\n* Richard Robichaux as Floyd the pharmacist\n* [[J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson]] as Captain J.

It stars [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Judy Greer]], and [[Laurence Fishburne]].\n\n''Where'd You Go, Bernadette'' was released on August 16, 2019, by [[Annapurna Pictures]] through their [[United Artists Releasing]] joint venture. It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nArchitect-turned-recluse Bernadette Fox ([[Cate Blanchett]]) is settled down with her husband Elgin ([[Billy Crudup]]) and their daughter Bee ([[Emma Nelson]]) in a dilapidated former schoolhouse in [[Seattle]]. Bernadette hates people, hates leaving the house, hates Seattle, and more than anything, she hates the other parents at her 15-year-old daughter Bee's school. This includes her neighbor Audrey Griffin ([[Kristen Wiig]]).\n\nDespite her misanthropic behavior, Bernadette is exceptionally close to Bee and reluctantly agrees to go on a family vacation to [[Antarctica]] at Bee's request. Bernadette starts to behave oddly, concerning everyone. She uses a cocktail of prescription drugs to control her anxiety and insomnia, which grows worse as the Antarctica trip nears. Her feud with Audrey grows more intense; at one point Audrey accuses Bernadette of running over her foot while speeding away in her car. Later on, the hillside above Audrey's home which Bernadette had cleared of invasive blackberries subsides into Audrey's garden and house during heavy rain. Although she insists that she was only complying with Audrey's request, Elgin accuses architect Bernadette of knowing that the hill would collapse without the blackberries to hold it in place.\n\nBernadette has a personal assistant named Manjula in India with whom she regularly communicates. One day, she finds Elgin, Dr. Kurtz ([[Judy Greer]]), and an FBI agent at her home for an intervention. They tell her that Manjula is a front for a Russian criminal operation which has Bernadette\u2019s personal information and is planning to defraud her family. Elgin wants Bernadette to go with Dr. Kurtz to a mental hospital to seek treatment, which horrifies her. She sneaks out of the house and finds refuge with Audrey, whom she makes amends with. With Audrey's help, Bernadette flies to Antarctica. Elgin and Bee follow in hot pursuit, after the FBI agent tells them that the Russian criminal has been arrested and is no longer a threat.\n\nIn Antarctica, Bernadette befriends a scientist and learns that the research station at the South Pole is going to be completely rebuilt and will need an architect. She smuggles herself off her cruise ship and onto [[Palmer Station]], where she convinces the team leader ([[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]]) to give her a spot on the next convoy to the South Pole. Meanwhile, Elgin comes to the realization that he has failed his wife in not supporting her. He and Bee catch up with her at the station, and realizing that her passion and creativity have been reignited, give their permission to her to make the 5-week journey.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Bernadette Fox\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as Elgin Branch\n* Emma Nelson as Bee Branch\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Audrey Griffin\n* [[James Urbaniak]] as Marcus Strang\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Dr. Janelle Kurtz\n* [[Troian Bellisario]] as Becky\n* [[Zo\u00eb Chao]] as Soo-Lin Lee-Segal\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Paul Jellinek\n* [[Claudia Doumit]] as Iris\n* Katelyn Statton as Vivian\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as David Walker\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Judy Toll\n* Richard Robichaux as Floyd the pharmacist\n* [[J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson]] as Captain J.
