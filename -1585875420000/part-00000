In the \"afterlife\" scenes in the finale, sunlight obscures His face when cameras are focused on Him and before the end of the afterlife scenes, He is seen in silhouette.\n*Uncredited voice actor as [[Satan]] - Unlike Bro who physically appears, Satan is only depicted as a reddish white light and speaks with a sinister, bone-chilling voice.

Upon learning about this said information, Franco instantly claims custody of the said kid; and in order to successfully do so, he tries seeking Mayor Enrique's help. Without hesitation, Enrique gives his full support to Franco's case. He instantly suggests a DNA test; and once the DNA test results prove that Franco is in fact Santino's biological father, the DSWD will then be awarding Santino's custody to him. After Enrique finds out that Franco is not the real father, Enrique decided to have a DNA test. It is then proven that Enrique is Santino's real father, and the DNA sample Franco gave was actually Enrique's. Enrique then decided to back out of the mayoral race in order to spend more time with his children, and gets ready to face corruption charges that may be filed against him after leaving office. Meanwhile, a fugitive Robert greets Enrique during his birthday, with Rico and Santino abducted by Robert. Mario and Enrique then pursue a chase against Robert, which leads to the death of Enrique and injuries to Rico during the rescue process.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbn.com/Weekdays/episode/detail/article/6215/maybukaspa/Episode244.aspx |title=ABS-CBN.com |publisher=ABS-CBN.com|date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n*[[Jay Manalo]] as Franco de Jesus - a man who claims that he is Santino's real father.

It was later revealed that her friend was Teresa Malimban, a woman connected to the lives of people of Bagong Pag-asa. She found out that her friend had died more than 5 years ago and later decided to search for Teresa's son Gabriel (who is Santino).\n\n===Chapter Thirty-Six: Temptation===\nAfter Enrique's death, Tilde was arrested for being involved in the death of Malena. However, she was able to escape under the pretense of labor; while being driven, she got the gun of Dante, the policeman driving the vehicle. Rico was resentful of Santino because of their father's death. Santino then felt sad as he believes he's bad luck due to the death of Enrique and the anger of Rico; Father Jose told him that he was not the Santino who was trying to be happy despite the hardships and trials. Meanwhile, Santino was being told by a voice (possibly Satan's) that he should come to it and he was cursed by Bro. He ends up being helped by angels on his way and ends up at a home for the homeless, run by Lola Milgaros, a blind grandmother. Meanwhile, a Filipino-Chinese businessman named Mr. Chan is trying to put into action his plan to take the house and the land where it stands for his business expansion. He constantly tries to take the place but also fails. Santino meets Mr. Chan and discovers his ailing daughter whom he heals. Mr. Chan continues to do his pursuit despite his daughter's recovery and also still doesn't believe in God. On one night, Lola Milagros' home is set on fire by arsonists and miracles happen when rain falls and stops the fire. Learning of the incident, Mr. Chan has a change of heart and quits his pursuit by giving Milagros a check of a huge sum of money for repairs and necessities.\n\n*[[Gloria Sevilla]] as Lola Milagros - A blind old woman who is the owner of a home open to homeless people.\n*Jeff Henson Dee as Mr. Chan - a wealthy [[Chinese Filipino]] businessman who is constantly trying to take the house for the homeless as well as the land where it stands. He later helps Milagros after arsonists set fire to her house.\n\n===Chapter Thirty-Seven: Believe===\nA Manila-based journalist named Paulo Pe\u00f1aflor arrives at Bagong Pag-asa to search for news featuring the miracles in the small town. And to his delight, he alone gets his hands on the most sensational news there is, Rico's exclusive encounters with his so-called Bro ''(later revealed as Satan)''. Though a non-believer of such events, Paulo pursues this rather controversial issue for his show's sake. Santino has now returned to Bagong Pag-asa, but his former petty argument with Rico turns out to be a completely heated dispute. Apparently, Santino tries relaying Bro's real message to Rico, which instantly infuriates the latter. Given the rather controversial situation, Paulo then gets another angle for a truly sensational scoop. And to his surprise, the tension is further heightened up by Tilde's hired con-artist. This results in an accident which endangered Stella's life; but fortunately, Santino is around to save her. Meanwhile, detainees in Bagong Pag-asa's jail held the police chief hostage, and ordered all policemen to give them their arms. After the commotion in Bagong Pgag-asa Jail ended in a miracle, a group of radicals led by Tilde's con-artist try to get Santino to perform more miracles so they may believe. Their actions however compromise Santino's safety and eventually puts his life in danger. Hearing of this, Paolo rescues Santino ''(who is fleeing from the radicals)'' and makes him stay in a secluded countryside villa he rented for his tenure in Bagong Pag-asa. There he takes care of Santino until it is safe for him to return. In one interview session, Paolo reveals to Santino an event that triggered his loss of faith in Christ; during his tenure as a missionary, the bombing of a chapel built by his congregation resulted in the death of several people and his co-missionaries. In the remains of the chapel, he managed to save a baby which died when he thought Jesus would help it. He threw away his habit and abandoned his vocation in despair. At the monastery, the monks and Mario collaborate with each other to find Santino.\n\n*[[Ryan Agoncillo]] as Paulo Pe\u00f1aflor - A journalist and CBN News Reporter who visits Bagong Pag-asa after hearing about the news of Rico's encounter with \"Bro\". He was a former missionary who abandoned his vocation and lost his faith in Christ.\n\n===Chapter Thirty-Eight: Amen===\nPaolo turns Santino over to Mario and the police chief before going on an errand. As Mario contacts the monks of Santino's safety while driving the latter back to Bagong Pag-asa, Tilde deviously abducts Mario's daughter Joy, and calls Mario to request that Santino be brought to her in exchange for Joy's release. Santino convinces Mario that he would respond to Tilde's request; Mario agreeing unconditionally out of his desperate situation. Although Mario would not be giving Santino to Tilde, the young boy was abducted by Tilde, who asked the former to cure her sickness. Tilde was enraged and locked up Santino in a closet when Santino refused to heal her since he has no more power to cure the sick. Tilde then insistently commands him to lay his miraculous hands on her, but she accidentally pushes Santino off a flight of stairs, causing Santino's head to hit very hard on the floor, thus, causing him to instantly lose his consciousness\u2014just as Rico once predicted. Santino was then hospitalized, but when his chances of survival were declining, the priests then decided to bring his dying body to the monastery. Santino dies in the monastery, and his wish to reunite with his parents was finally granted, though it caused deep grief to everyone. People then flocked to Bagong Pag-asa in order to pay the necessary respects to his remains, while Tilde awaits sentencing for her crimes. During funeral preparations were underway, Santino wakes up alive after he was told by his parents ''(revealed to be Enrique and Teresa)'' in the afterlife that the time for him to be reunited with them has not yet come, and he still needs to continue his mission on Earth, and to be with and protect his half-brother Rico. This miracle was witnessed by Paolo, who saw the young boy sitting alongside Bro. People of Bagong Pag-asa rejoiced upon seeing Santino alive once more. This occurrence brought back Paolo's faith in God, and Santino lives a normal life thereafter. In the end of the series, Paolo gives a narration on what hope for him is and how Santino changed his life, and is now back on his vocation of priesthood after witnessing the miracle.\n\n*[[Charo Santos-Concio]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] - the mother of Bro.

But it\u2019s great to note that the gamble has paid off in a big way: ''May Bukas Pa'' has been enjoying very good ratings, proving what we\u2019ve been saying all this time--that viewers want to be inspired by the dramas they watch..\" However, he criticized the show's \"religious\" scenes which are \"poorly, shallowly staged, thus making genuine inspiration and devotion difficult to come by while viewing the series.\" He further criticized the show's use of extras mostly playing sick people, who turn out to be bad actors. He adds, \"Any director worth his salt would have sensed that the montage of healing needed good actors to make it meaningful and moving. Why were inept actors used instead? Possibly because the production was scrimping on talent fees. Well, it was a penny-wise pound-foolish decision, because the important sequence was botched.\"<ref>[http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus \"\u2018May Bukas Pa,\u2019 plus and minus\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320040119/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090316-194515/May-Bukas-Pa-plus-and-minus|date=20 March 2009}} by Nestor Torre, 16 March 2009.</ref>\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|rowspan=9| 2009 || 1st MTRCB TV Awards || Special Award for Promoting Moral Values || {{won}}\n|-\n| Seoul International Drama Awards<ref>{{cite web|url=http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|title=Cristine Reyes attends Seoul International Drama Awards; Eva Fonda wins Special Prize|publisher=Telebisyon.net|date=23 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017125820/http://telebisyon.net/balita/Cristine-Reyes-attends-Seoul-International-Drama-Awards-Eva-Fonda-wins-Special-Prize/artikulo/73679/|archivedate=17 October 2012}}</ref> || Best Drama Series ||{{nom}}\n|-\n| Catholic Mass Media Awards || Best Drama (tied with [[Tayong Dalawa]]) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya New Face (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| [[ASAP (variety show)|ASAP Pop Viewer's Choice Awards]] || Pop Kapamilya TV Show|| {{nom}}\n|-\n| 18th KBP Golden Dove Awards || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Primetime Drama Series || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Male New TV Personality (Zajian Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| PMPC Star Awards for Television || Best Drama Actor (Albert Martinez) || {{nom}}\n|-\n| rowspan=4|2010 || 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Special Jury Award for Television || {{won}}\n|-\n| 8th Gawad Tanglaw || Natatanging Gawad TANGLAW para sa Sining ng Telebisyon (Zaijan Jaranilla) || {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=2|[[2010 GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards|41st GMMSF Box-Office Entertainment Awards]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=579374&publicationSubCategoryId=70|title=Chiz: Don't extend Pagcor chief's term &#124; Headlines, News, The Philippine Star|publisher=philstar.com|date=20 May 2013|accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref> || TV Program of the Year || {{won}}\n|-\n| TV Directors of the Year (Jojo Saguin and Jerome Pobocan ) || {{won}}\n|}\n\nMay Bukas Pa also received a special award at the 2009 Catholic Mass Media Awards (besides its Best Drama award), given by Cardinal Archbishop [[Gaudencio Rosales]].

Santino also started to reunite with the priests again. Meanwhile, the DSWD came to the monastery and needed to take Santino away from the priests because another couple saw the records of all the kids in the DSWD. They also saw the records of Santino so they planned to take Santino. The couple adopted Santino, but the wife tried to \"re-live\" her dead son in the person of Santino. This caused the couple problems, and it was decided that he be returned to the DSWD. Meanwhile, Rico's accident finally makes Malena a changed woman. Aside from paying Santino the proper apologies for all her misdeeds, Malena also drops by Baby and Ato's store to say sorry for all her shortcomings. Later, after having a fight with Tilde, Malena's fall off a cliff put her in a rather critical condition, which eventually led to her untimely death. Santino tries reviving her, just as Rico requested, but even his miraculous hands couldn\u2019t change Malena's fate. On the other hand, Tilde's previous threats to Malena instantly backfire. Incidentally, someone witnessed what she had done to Malena. Father Jose applies for a job in a nearby resort, but it was discovered that his workplace is actually a casino. Santino sees Enrique in the place; the latter asked him to remain silent about that, but the former refused.

Pretty much aware of the scarcity of water in Bagong Pag-asa, she ends up selling her remaining supply for a pretty unreasonable price. Despite the old lady's bad reputation, Santino and his friends end up defending her from enraged neighbors; but instead of showing gratitude to the said kids, she ends up driving them away. On the other hand, the heat wave phenomenon in Bagong Pag-asa finally takes its toll on its residents; but despite the said fact, Enrique remains unmoved regarding the matter. Enrique then verbally harasses Mario, whom he accused of being Bagong Pag-asa's jueteng lord. A fire in Bagong Pag-asa destroyed Atong and Baby's livelihood; a newly-wed (to Tilde) Enrique helped them, but in return they would have to blame Cocoy for the fire, even if the fire was just an accident.

After the incident, Cocoy discovers that Santino has actually gone astray. And given the said situation, he is left with no other choice but to remain at large up until he finds the missing miracle kid. Incidentally, after obliviously walking around the streets of Manila to look for his big brother Cocoy, Santino finds himself spending sometime with Santa Claus. Santa Claus pursues his calling of giving out gifts from one house to another, and surprisingly, he ends up finding himself in his very own house. Immediately, his son Ramon recognizes him; but instead of greeting him with a hearty welcome, the lad instantly shoves him away. Ramon tries warning his younger sister Lea. Surprisingly, in contrast to her brother's display of disgust, Lea is somehow looking forward to seeing her biological father; so she makes it a plan to look for him before her time finally runs out. In order to fulfill his promise to Totoy, Santino drops by the hospital to lay his miraculous hand on Lea; and after successfully doing so, they rush to the precinct in order to check on Totoy's condition.

Incidentally, all these good deeds she has to offer have corresponding prices. Apparently, she is a self-professed material girl, and any thing that could bring her cash is basically worth her while. During one of their conversations, Santino tells Mia about the 1-million-peso reward Enrique is giving out in exchange for him and others are also in pursuit of the reward money; and upon learning about this, the young lady couldn\u2019t help but feel the urge of getting her hand on the said bundle of cash. Upon getting her chance, Mia tricks Santino to go with her, alone. At the last minute, Mia changes her mind about bringing Santino back to Bagong Pag-asa.

Without hesitation, Enrique gives his full support to Franco's case. He instantly suggests a DNA test; and once the DNA test results prove that Franco is in fact Santino's biological father, the DSWD will then be awarding Santino's custody to him. After Enrique finds out that Franco is not the real father, Enrique decided to have a DNA test. It is then proven that Enrique is Santino's real father, and the DNA sample Franco gave was actually Enrique's.

However, she was able to escape under the pretense of labor; while being driven, she got the gun of Dante, the policeman driving the vehicle. Rico was resentful of Santino because of their father's death. Santino then felt sad as he believes he's bad luck due to the death of Enrique and the anger of Rico; Father Jose told him that he was not the Santino who was trying to be happy despite the hardships and trials. Meanwhile, Santino was being told by a voice (possibly Satan's) that he should come to it and he was cursed by Bro. He ends up being helped by angels on his way and ends up at a home for the homeless, run by Lola Milgaros, a blind grandmother. Meanwhile, a Filipino-Chinese businessman named Mr. Chan is trying to put into action his plan to take the house and the land where it stands for his business expansion.

And to his delight, he alone gets his hands on the most sensational news there is, Rico's exclusive encounters with his so-called Bro ''(later revealed as Satan)''. Though a non-believer of such events, Paulo pursues this rather controversial issue for his show's sake. Santino has now returned to Bagong Pag-asa, but his former petty argument with Rico turns out to be a completely heated dispute. Apparently, Santino tries relaying Bro's real message to Rico, which instantly infuriates the latter. Given the rather controversial situation, Paulo then gets another angle for a truly sensational scoop. And to his surprise, the tension is further heightened up by Tilde's hired con-artist. This results in an accident which endangered Stella's life; but fortunately, Santino is around to save her. Meanwhile, detainees in Bagong Pag-asa's jail held the police chief hostage, and ordered all policemen to give them their arms. After the commotion in Bagong Pgag-asa Jail ended in a miracle, a group of radicals led by Tilde's con-artist try to get Santino to perform more miracles so they may believe. Their actions however compromise Santino's safety and eventually puts his life in danger. Hearing of this, Paolo rescues Santino ''(who is fleeing from the radicals)'' and makes him stay in a secluded countryside villa he rented for his tenure in Bagong Pag-asa. There he takes care of Santino until it is safe for him to return. In one interview session, Paolo reveals to Santino an event that triggered his loss of faith in Christ; during his tenure as a missionary, the bombing of a chapel built by his congregation resulted in the death of several people and his co-missionaries. In the remains of the chapel, he managed to save a baby which died when he thought Jesus would help it. He threw away his habit and abandoned his vocation in despair.

As Mario contacts the monks of Santino's safety while driving the latter back to Bagong Pag-asa, Tilde deviously abducts Mario's daughter Joy, and calls Mario to request that Santino be brought to her in exchange for Joy's release. Santino convinces Mario that he would respond to Tilde's request; Mario agreeing unconditionally out of his desperate situation. Although Mario would not be giving Santino to Tilde, the young boy was abducted by Tilde, who asked the former to cure her sickness. Tilde was enraged and locked up Santino in a closet when Santino refused to heal her since he has no more power to cure the sick. Tilde then insistently commands him to lay his miraculous hands on her, but she accidentally pushes Santino off a flight of stairs, causing Santino's head to hit very hard on the floor, thus, causing him to instantly lose his consciousness\u2014just as Rico once predicted. Santino was then hospitalized, but when his chances of survival were declining, the priests then decided to bring his dying body to the monastery. Santino dies in the monastery, and his wish to reunite with his parents was finally granted, though it caused deep grief to everyone. People then flocked to Bagong Pag-asa in order to pay the necessary respects to his remains, while Tilde awaits sentencing for her crimes. During funeral preparations were underway, Santino wakes up alive after he was told by his parents ''(revealed to be Enrique and Teresa)'' in the afterlife that the time for him to be reunited with them has not yet come, and he still needs to continue his mission on Earth, and to be with and protect his half-brother Rico. This miracle was witnessed by Paolo, who saw the young boy sitting alongside Bro. People of Bagong Pag-asa rejoiced upon seeing Santino alive once more. This occurrence brought back Paolo's faith in God, and Santino lives a normal life thereafter. In the end of the series, Paolo gives a narration on what hope for him is and how Santino changed his life, and is now back on his vocation of priesthood after witnessing the miracle.\n\n*[[Charo Santos-Concio]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] - the mother of Bro.

But it\u2019s great to note that the gamble has paid off in a big way: ''May Bukas Pa'' has been enjoying very good ratings, proving what we\u2019ve been saying all this time--that viewers want to be inspired by the dramas they watch..\" However, he criticized the show's \"religious\" scenes which are \"poorly, shallowly staged, thus making genuine inspiration and devotion difficult to come by while viewing the series.\" He further criticized the show's use of extras mostly playing sick people, who turn out to be bad actors. He adds, \"Any director worth his salt would have sensed that the montage of healing needed good actors to make it meaningful and moving. Why were inept actors used instead?
