The two finalists face off for gold and silver medals. Each wrestler who loses to one of the two finalists moves into the repechage, culminating in a pair of bronze medal matches featuring the semifinal losers each facing the remaining repechage opponent from their half of the bracket.\n\nEach bout consists of up to three rounds, lasting two minutes apiece. The wrestler who scores more points in each round is the winner of that rounds; the bout ends when one wrestler has won two rounds (and thus the match).\n\n==Schedule==\n<small>All times are [[British

When the Cowboys' turn came up in the third round, the highest rated player on their board was [[quarterback]] [[Joe Montana]]. However, feeling that the [[quarterback]] position was in excellent shape with [[Roger Staubach]], [[Danny White]] and [[Glenn Carano]], the Cowboys needing a tight end to join Billy Joe DuPree infamously deviated from their philosophy and chose Cosbie instead.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d825e0e26/printable/thirty-years-later-memories-of-the-catch-still-linger | title=Thirty years later, memories of 'The Catch' still linger | accessdate=June 23, 2018}}</ref> After being passed over by the next five teams in the draft order, the [[San Francisco 49ers]] selected Montana as the final player of the third round.\n\nIn his first 2 seasons, he was a backup behind [[Billy Joe DuPree]] and [[Jay Saldi]], playing mainly on [[special teams]] and as a blocking tight end on short-yardage and goal-line situations.\n\nIn [[1981 NFL season|1981]], he almost won the starting tight end spot, but was still able to share it with Dupree and tied for the team lead with 5 [[touchdown]] receptions. In [[1982 NFL season|1982]], he was named the starter during the 9 game strike shortened season, finishing second on the team with 30 receptions (led the NFC tight ends) for 441 yards, a 14.7-yard average and 4 [[touchdown]] receptions (led the team).\n\nIn [[1983 NFL season|1983]], he emerged as one of the league's top tight ends, making 46 receptions (franchise record for tight ends) for 588 yards (third on the team) and 6 [[touchdown]]s. He also earned his first invitation to the [[Pro Bowl]]. \n\nIn [[1984 NFL season|1984]], he broke his own team record for receptions by a tight end with 60 catches, which led the team and was second among NFC tight ends. He was second on the team with 789 yards and 4 [[touchdown]]s.\n\nIn [[1985 NFL season|1985]], he set a team record for receptions by a tight end for the third straight year with 64 catches. He also established a franchise record for receiving yards in a season by a tight end (793) and had 6 [[touchdown]]s (second on the team). He was named to the [[UPI]] All-Pro NFC team.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=191&dat=19851219&id=z2JSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sC4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6753,4689398 | title=Patriots, Bears boast All-Pro lineups | accessdate=June 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1986 NFL season|1986]], his production fell more than 50 percent to 28 receptions for 312 yards and one [[touchdown]], mainly because of the extensive use of [[running back]] [[Herschel Walker]] as a receiver out of the back field, that produced 837 yards.\n\nIn [[1987 NFL season|1987]], he had 36 receptions for 421 yards and 3 [[touchdown]]s, becoming the franchise's All-time leading receiver among tight ends and his 288 catches ranked him fifth on the All-time Cowboys receiving list. \n\nIn [[1988 NFL season|1988]], he lost his starting job in the fifth game due to being limited by offseason surgery on his Achilles tendon, posting 4 starts, 12 receptions and 112 yards. In [[1989 NFL season|1989]], with the arrival of new head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], he was left unprotected in [[Plan B free agency]].\n\nAlthough he was a strong blocker, he became more of a receiving threat than any previous Cowboys [[tight end]]. He caught over 60 passes in a season twice during his career, and set team records for a [[tight end]] with catches and yards per season and career, which have since been broken by [[Jay Novacek]] and [[Jason Witten]]. He is part of the Cowboys franchise's legacy of great tight ends that includes: [[Jim Doran]], [[Lee Folkins]], [[Pettis Norman]], [[Mike Ditka]], [[Billy Joe DuPree]], [[Jay Novacek]] and [[Jason Witten]].\n\nCosbie caught 300 passes for 3,728 yards and 30 [[touchdown]]s and also had 22 catches for 243 yards and 3 [[touchdown]]s in 7 playoff games.

In 1976, he was named the starter at [[tight end]], registering 34 receptions for 444 yards and one [[touchdown]]. In 1977, he posted 31 receptions for 517 yards and one [[touchdown]]. \n\nIn 1978, he ran over strong safety Dan Keefe twice, knocking him unconscious both times during the spring game. In the regular season, he recorded 29 receptions for 427 yards and 3 [[touchdown]]s. He finished his Santa Clara career with 120 receptions for 1,721 yards, 14.3 yards per reception and 10 [[touchdown]]s.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&dat=19820509&id=EWVfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GV4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=5944,2485553| title=Cowboys TE Flyer Speaker | accessdate=June 23, 2018}}</ref> His records were eventually broken by [[Brent Jones]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.santaclarasports.org/notable-santa-clara-athletes/ | title=Notable Santa Clara Athletes | accessdate=June 23, 2018}}</ref> For his achievements, Cosbie was inducted into the [[Santa Clara University]] Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Dallas Cowboys===\nCosbie was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (76th overall) of the [[1979 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19790521&id=XONNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mYsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1536,3228395 | title=Cowboys sign draftee | accessdate=June 23, 2018}}</ref> The team's draft strategy through that time was to take the highest-ranked player on their draft board, regardless of position. When the Cowboys' turn came up in the third round, the highest rated player on their board was [[quarterback]] [[Joe Montana]]. However, feeling that the [[quarterback]] position was in excellent shape with [[Roger Staubach]], [[Danny White]] and [[Glenn Carano]], the Cowboys needing a tight end to join Billy Joe DuPree infamously deviated from their philosophy and chose Cosbie instead.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d825e0e26/printable/thirty-years-later-memories-of-the-catch-still-linger | title=Thirty years later, memories of 'The Catch' still linger | accessdate=June 23, 2018}}</ref> After being passed over by the next five teams in the draft order, the [[San Francisco 49ers]] selected Montana as the final player of the third round.\n\nIn his first 2 seasons, he was a backup behind [[Billy Joe DuPree]] and [[Jay Saldi]], playing mainly on [[special teams]] and as a blocking tight end on short-yardage and goal-line situations.\n\nIn [[1981 NFL season|1981]], he almost won the starting tight end spot, but was still able to share it with Dupree and tied for the team lead with 5 [[touchdown]] receptions. In [[1982 NFL season|1982]], he was named the starter during the 9 game strike shortened season, finishing second on the team with 30 receptions (led the NFC tight ends) for 441 yards, a 14.7-yard average and 4 [[touchdown]] receptions (led the team).\n\nIn [[1983 NFL season|1983]], he emerged as one of the league's top tight ends, making 46 receptions (franchise record for tight ends) for 588 yards (third on the team) and 6 [[touchdown]]s. He also earned his first invitation to the [[Pro Bowl]]. \n\nIn [[1984 NFL season|1984]], he broke his own team record for receptions by a tight end with 60 catches, which led the team and was second among NFC tight ends. He was second on the team with 789 yards and 4 [[touchdown]]s.\n\nIn [[1985 NFL season|1985]], he set a team record for receptions by a tight end for the third straight year with 64 catches. He also established a franchise record for receiving yards in a season by a tight end (793) and had 6 [[touchdown]]s (second on the team). He was named to the [[UPI]] All-Pro NFC team.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=191&dat=19851219&id=z2JSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sC4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6753,4689398 | title=Patriots, Bears boast All-Pro lineups | accessdate=June 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1986 NFL season|1986]], his production fell more than 50 percent to 28 receptions for 312 yards and one [[touchdown]], mainly because of the extensive use of [[running back]] [[Herschel Walker]] as a receiver out of the back field, that produced 837 yards.\n\nIn [[1987 NFL season|1987]], he had 36 receptions for 421 yards and 3 [[touchdown]]s, becoming the franchise's All-time leading receiver among tight ends and his 288 catches ranked him fifth on the All-time Cowboys receiving list. \n\nIn [[1988 NFL season|1988]], he lost his starting job in the fifth game due to being limited by offseason surgery on his Achilles tendon, posting 4 starts, 12 receptions and 112 yards. In [[1989 NFL season|1989]], with the arrival of new head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], he was left unprotected in [[Plan B free agency]].\n\nAlthough he was a strong blocker, he became more of a receiving threat than any previous Cowboys [[tight end]]. He caught over 60 passes in a season twice during his career, and set team records for a [[tight end]] with catches and yards per season and career, which have since been broken by [[Jay Novacek]] and [[Jason Witten]]. He is part of the Cowboys franchise's legacy of great tight ends that includes: [[Jim Doran]], [[Lee Folkins]], [[Pettis Norman]], [[Mike Ditka]], [[Billy Joe DuPree]], [[Jay Novacek]] and [[Jason Witten]].\n\nCosbie caught 300 passes for 3,728 yards and 30 [[touchdown]]s and also had 22 catches for 243 yards and 3 [[touchdown]]s in 7 playoff games. He still ranks eleventh in franchise history in receptions and ninth in receiving yards. He made three straight [[Pro Bowl]]s from [[1984 Pro Bowl|1983]] to [[1986 Pro Bowl|1985]].\n\n===Denver Broncos===\nOn March 30, [[1989 NFL season|1989]], he was signed by the [[Denver Broncos]] in [[Plan B free agency]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&dat=19890331&id=fOdaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=boAMAAAAIBAJ&pg=7160,6377456 | title=Cosbie Signs With Broncos | accessdate=June 23, 2018}}</ref> He decided to retire during training camp that season, after playing for 10 years in the [[NFL]] and also in three [[NFC Championship game]]s.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19890804&id=DYQzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yzIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=5584,5842618 | title=TE Cosbie retires after 10 seasons | accessdate=June 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Coaching career==\n*1990, volunteer assistant coach at [[Santa Clara University]].\n*1993\u20131994, assistant to [[head coach]] [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] at [[Stanford University]]\n*1995\u20131996, athletic director and head football coach of Division III [[Menlo College]]\n*1997\u20131998, offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach at [[University of California, Berkeley]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.calbears.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30100&ATCLID=207742271 |title=Doug Cosbie and Monte Clark Resign |publisher=Cal Athletics |date=November 22, 1998 |accessdate=May 6, 2014 |quote=served as the Bears offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach for the past two seasons |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508030718/http://www.calbears.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=30100&ATCLID=207742271 |archivedate=May 8, 2014 }}</ref>\n*2000, head football coach of the [[Spring Football League]] Los Angeles Dragons\n*2009\u20132010, head football coach of the [[Sacramento High School]]\n*2013\u20132015, head football coach of the [[Kamehameha Schools]] Warriors\n\n==Personal life==\nCosbie worked in Hollywood from 2006 to 2010 for [[Shangri-La Entertainment]].
