Oceania's largest export markets include Japan, China, the United States and South Korea.  The majority of people living in Australia and to a lesser extent, New Zealand work in mining, electrical and manufacturing sectors also.\n\n===Manufacturing===\nThe manufacturing of clothing is a major industry in some parts of the Pacific, especially [[Economy of Fiji#Tourism|Fiji]], although this is decreasing.\n\nAustralia boasts the largest amount of manufacturing in the region.  Producing cars, electrical equipment, machinery and clothes.\n\n===Tourism===\nTourism has become a large source of income for many in the Pacific; tourists come from Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. [[Economy of Fiji#Tourism|Fiji]] currently draws almost half a million tourists each year; more than a quarter from Australia. This contributes $1 billion or more since 1995 to Fiji's economy but the Government of Fiji islands underestimate these figures due to invisible economy inside tourism industry.\n\n===Agriculture and fishing===\nAgriculture and natural resources constitutes only 5% to 10% of Oceania's total jobs, but contributes substantially to export performance. The most populous two nations, Australia and New Zealand, are also the most developed and have majority service industries. This dilutes the data from the less developed Pacific Island nations who have major agricultural economies. Most of the Pacific countries (excluding Australia and New Zealand) the primary industry is agriculture. Many nations are still quintessentially agricultural; for example, 80% of the population of [[Vanuatu]] and 70% of the population of [[Fiji]] works in [[agriculture]]. The main produce from the pacific is [[copra]] or [[coconut]], but [[timber]], [[beef]], [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[sugar]] and [[ginger]] are also commonly grown across the [[tropics]] of the [[Pacific]]. [[Fishing]] provides a major [[industry]] for many of the smaller nations in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], although many [[fishing]] areas are exploited by other larger countries, namely Japan. [[Natural Resources]], such as [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[nickel]] and [[gold]], are mined in Australia and the [[Solomon Islands]]. Oceania's largest export markets include Japan, China, the United States, India, South Korea and the [[European Union]].\n\n===International aid and charity===\n\n====Oceanian donor nations====\nOceania's most populous nations, Australia and New Zealand, are both highly developed nations and are large international aid donors. These two wealthy nations share the region with less developed nations which still rely on [[foreign aid]] for [[development aid|development]]. In the 2007/08 financial year Australia provided $3.155 billion worth of official development assistance, of which $2.731 billion will be managed by AusAID. Every week, each Australian puts in around $2.40 to pay for Australia's aid program, amounting to around 1% of the Australian Federal Government expenditure compared to the 42% spent on social security and welfare.\n\n====Oceanian recipient states====\nIn the [[Solomon Islands]] 50% of government spending is paid for by international donors; namely Australia, New Zealand, the [[European Union]], Japan and the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]).\n\n==Global trade relations==\nThis region consists of many trading relations because of the small amount of land and limited resources they have. Many have trading economies and are transitioning to a developed economy and infrastructure.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Oceanian countries by GDP (nominal)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Oceania in topic|Economy of}}\n{{Oceania topics}}\n{{Currences by continent |state=expanded}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Economy Of Oceania}}\n[[Category:Economy of Oceania| ]]\n[[Category:Economies by continent|Oceania]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=August 2009}}\n{{Infobox economy\n| continent = Oceania\n| population = estimated 38 million (2014)<ref name=\"stats\">{{cite web |url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats6.htm |title= Internet Usage and Population in Oceania |accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref>\n| gdp = [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|PPP]]: [[International dollar|US$]]1.67 trillion (2014)\n| per capita = [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|PPP]]: [[International dollar|$]]22,647\n| footnote = During 2003 unless otherwise stated.

It differs from [[Wikipedia]] in that it offers tutorials and other materials for the fostering of learning, rather than an encyclopedia; like Wikipedia it is available in many languages.\n\nOne element of Wikiversity is a set of ''WikiJournals'' which publish peer-reviewed articles in a stable, [[Bibliographic index|indexed]], and [[Citation|citable]], format comparable with [[academic journal]]s; these can be copied to Wikipedia, and are sometimes based on Wikipedia articles.\n\n== History ==\nWikiversity's data phase officially began on August 15, 2006, with the [[v:|English language Wikiversity]].\n\nThe idea of Wikiversity began with the initial development of the Wikiversity community within the [[Wikibooks]] project, however when it was nominated for deletion from Wikibooks, soon there was a proposal to make Wikiversity an independent Wikimedia project,<ref>{{cite web |author=Reswik |url=http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:History_of_Wikiversity |title=Wikiversity:History of Wikiversity |website=Wikiversity |date=2006-08-22 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}</ref> with the fundamental goal to broaden the scope of activities within the Wikimedia community to include additional types of learning resources in addition to textbooks.\n\nTwo proposals were made.

When an old schoolmate Mikami ([[Chish\u016b Ry\u016b]]) approaches him for help concerning his daughter Fumiko ([[Yoshiko Kuga]]), who has run off owing to a conflict with her father, he agrees.  Finding her in a bar where she now works, he listens to her side of the story.  Fumiko complains that her father is stubborn, insisting on arranging her marriage, whereas she has now fallen in love with a musician and is adamant to lead life her own way.\n\nOne day during work, a young man named Masahiko Taniguchi ([[Keiji Sada]]) approaches Hirayama to ask for the hand of his elder daughter, Setsuko ([[Ineko Arima]]).  Hirayama is extremely unhappy that his daughter has made wedding plans on her own.  He confronts her at home and says that she must not go to work until she sees the folly of her ways.  Hirayama tries to find out more about Taniguchi from his subordinate.\n\nOwing to the standoff, his daughter's friend Yukiko ([[Fujiko Yamamoto]]) tries a ruse in which she asks Hirayama's opinion concerning a similar situation \u2013 her mother forcing her to marry someone she didn't like.  When Hirayama advises her to ignore her mother, Yukiko reveals it is all a setup and states that Hirayama has just given his consent to Setsuko's marriage.\n\nDespite the ruse, Hirayama remains unchanged and Hirayama's wife Kiyoko ([[Kinuyo Tanaka]]) accuses her husband of being \"inconsistent\". Even his younger daughter Hisako ([[Miyuki Kuwano]]) is on the side of her sister, finding her father too old-fashioned.  Finally, after the couple's insistence on getting married, Hirayama decides to give in by attending his daughter's wedding.\n\nAfter the wedding, Mikami reveals that he, like Hirayama, has agreed to let his daughter select her own marriage partner.  After going for a short business trip outside Tokyo, Hirayama decides to visit the newly-weds at [[Hiroshima]] by train, where Taniguchi is stationed by his company.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Ineko Arima]] - Setsuko Hirayama\n* [[Fujiko Yamamoto]] - Yukiko Sasaki\n* [[Yoshiko Kuga]] - Fumiko Mikami\n* [[Shin Saburi]] - Wataru Hirayama\n* [[Kinuyo Tanaka]] - Kiyoko Hirayama\n* [[Miyuki Kuwano]] - Hisako Hirayama\n* [[Chish\u016b Ry\u016b]] ...

He is particularly venerated in [[the Fens]] of eastern England.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Vita-Guthlaci-Parker-Library-Corpus-Christi-Cambridge.png|thumb|Beginning of Felix's ''Life of St Guthlac'', 8C, [[Parker Library, Corpus Christi College]]]]\nGuthlac was the son of Penwalh or Penwald, a noble of the English kingdom of [[Mercia]], and his wife Tette. His sister is also venerated as St [[Pega]]. As a young man, Guthlac fought in the army of [[\u00c6thelred of Mercia]]. He subsequently became a [[monk]] at [[Repton|Repton Monastery]] in [[Derbyshire]] at the age of 24, under the abbess there, Repton being a double monastery. Two years later he sought to live the life of a [[hermit]], and moved out to the island of [[Crowland|Croyland, now called Crowland]], on [[St Bartholomew's Day]], AD 699. His early biographer Felix asserts that Guthlac could understand the ''strimulentes loquelas'' (\"sibilant speech\")<ref>{{harvnb |Colgrave |1985}}</ref> of British-speaking demons who haunted him there, only because Guthlac had spent some time in exile among [[Celtic Britons]].<ref>[[H. R. Loyn]], ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman conquest'', 2nd ed., 1991:11.</ref>\n\nGuthlac built a small [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] and [[Monastery|cells]] in the side of a plundered [[Tumulus|barrow]] on the island. There he lived  until his death on 11 April 714. Felix, writing within living memory of Guthlac, described his hermit's life:\n{{cquote|Now there was in the said island a mound built of clods of earth which greedy comers to the waste had dug open, in the hope of finding treasure there; in the side of this there seemed to be a sort of cistern, and in this Guthlac the man of blessed memory began to dwell, after building a hut over it. From the time when he first inhabited this hermitage this was his unalterable rule of life: namely to wear neither wool nor linen garments nor any other sort of soft material, but he spent the whole of his solitary life wearing garments made of skins. So great indeed was the abstinence of his daily life that from the time when he began to inhabit the desert he ate no food of any kind except that after sunset he took a scrap of barley bread and a small cup of muddy water. For when the sun reached its western limits, then he thankfully tasted some little provision for the needs of this mortal life.}}\n\nGuthlac suffered from [[fever|ague]] and [[marsh fever]].\n\nHis pious and holy ascetic life became the talk of the land, and many people visited Guthlac during his life to seek spiritual guidance from him.

At a time when it was being challenged by the crown, the Abbey relied significantly on the cult of Guthlac, which made it a place of pilgrimage and healing. That is reflected in a shift in the emphasis from the earlier accounts of Felix and others.

He is particularly venerated in [[the Fens]] of eastern England.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Vita-Guthlaci-Parker-Library-Corpus-Christi-Cambridge.png|thumb|Beginning of Felix's ''Life of St Guthlac'', 8C, [[Parker Library, Corpus Christi College]]]]\nGuthlac was the son of Penwalh or Penwald, a noble of the English kingdom of [[Mercia]], and his wife Tette. His sister is also venerated as St [[Pega]]. As a young man, Guthlac fought in the army of [[\u00c6thelred of Mercia]]. He subsequently became a [[monk]] at [[Repton|Repton Monastery]] in [[Derbyshire]] at the age of 24, under the abbess there, Repton being a double monastery. Two years later he sought to live the life of a [[hermit]], and moved out to the island of [[Crowland|Croyland, now called Crowland]], on [[St Bartholomew's Day]], AD 699. His early biographer Felix asserts that Guthlac could understand the ''strimulentes loquelas'' (\"sibilant speech\")<ref>{{harvnb |Colgrave |1985}}</ref> of British-speaking demons who haunted him there, only because Guthlac had spent some time in exile among [[Celtic Britons]].<ref>[[H. R. Loyn]], ''Anglo-Saxon England and the Norman conquest'', 2nd ed., 1991:11.</ref>\n\nGuthlac built a small [[Oratory (worship)|oratory]] and [[Monastery|cells]] in the side of a plundered [[Tumulus|barrow]] on the island. There he lived  until his death on 11 April 714. Felix, writing within living memory of Guthlac, described his hermit's life:\n{{cquote|Now there was in the said island a mound built of clods of earth which greedy comers to the waste had dug open, in the hope of finding treasure there; in the side of this there seemed to be a sort of cistern, and in this Guthlac the man of blessed memory began to dwell, after building a hut over it. From the time when he first inhabited this hermitage this was his unalterable rule of life: namely to wear neither wool nor linen garments nor any other sort of soft material, but he spent the whole of his solitary life wearing garments made of skins. So great indeed was the abstinence of his daily life that from the time when he began to inhabit the desert he ate no food of any kind except that after sunset he took a scrap of barley bread and a small cup of muddy water. For when the sun reached its western limits, then he thankfully tasted some little provision for the needs of this mortal life.}}\n\nGuthlac suffered from [[fever|ague]] and [[marsh fever]].\n\nHis pious and holy ascetic life became the talk of the land, and many people visited Guthlac during his life to seek spiritual guidance from him. He gave sanctuary to [[\u00c6thelbald of Mercia|\u00c6thelbald]], future king of [[Mercia]], who was fleeing from his cousin [[Ceolred of Mercia|Ceolred]]. Guthlac predicted that \u00c6thelbald would become king, and \u00c6thelbald promised to build him an [[abbey]] if his prophecy became true. \u00c6thelbald did become king, and even though Guthlac had died two years previously, kept his word and started construction of [[Crowland Abbey]] on St Bartholomew's Day 716. Guthlac's feast day is celebrated on 11 April.\n[[File:Guthlac-Bartholemew.png|thumb|left|St Guthlac, tormented by demons, is handed a [[scourge]] by [[St Bartholomew]], ''Guthlac Roll'', 1210, [[British Library]]]]\n[[File:St.Guthlac's Cross - geograph.org.uk - 593623.jpg|thumb|120px|St Guthlac's cross from c 1200, inscribed ''Hanc Petra Guthlac ...'', marked the boundary of Crowland Abbey]]\nThe 8th-century Latin ''Vita sancti Guthlaci'' is written by Felix, who describes the entry of the demons into Guthlac's cell:<ref>{{Citation |title=Medieval identity machines |volume=35 |series=Medieval cultures| first=Jeffrey J. |last= Cohen |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=0-8166-4002-5 |page=149}}, Chapter IV, ''The Solitude of Guthlac''</ref><ref>{{Citation |first=Bertram |last=Colgrave |authorlink=Bertram Colgrave |title=Felix's Life of Saint Guthlac |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1985 |isbn=0-521-31386-4 |page=103}}</ref>\n{{cquote|They were ferocious in appearance, terrible in shape with great heads, long necks, thin faces, yellow complexions, filthy beards, shaggy ears, wild foreheads, fierce eyes, foul mouths, horses' teeth, throats vomiting flames, twisted jaws, thick lips, strident voices, singed hair, fat cheeks, pigeons breasts, scabby thighs, knotty knees, crooked legs, swollen ankles, splay feet, spreading mouths, raucous cries.

Schaya Iangar, a Madras University Professor, taken in the 1860s by a photographer from the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Industrial Arts]]]]\nThe first ever demand for higher education in [[Madras Presidency]] was given in a public address to [[John Elphinstone, 13th Lord Elphinstone|Lord John Elphinstone]], Governor of Madras, signed by 70,000 residents when the Governor in Council was contemplating \"some effective and liberal measures for the establishment of an improved system of national education.\" This public petition, which was presented by the Advocate General Mr. George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English college in the city of Madras. Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a central collegiate institution or a \u2018university.\u2019 This university had twin departments&nbsp;\u2013 a high school for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, and a college for instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.\n\nThe University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its president. This was the precursor of the present [[Presidency College, Chennai]]. A systematic educational policy for India was formulated 14 years later by [[Wood's despatch]], which pointed out the rationale for \"creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University.\" The Dispatch recommended the establishment in the universities of Professorships \"for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages.\" As a result, the University of Madras, organised on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an Act of the [[Council of India|Legislative Council of India]].\n\nThe university progressed and expanded through the 19th century to span the whole of [[South India]], giving birth to universities like [[Mysore University]] (1916), [[Osmania University]] (1918), [[Andhra University]] (1926), [[Annamalai University]] (1929), [[University of Kerala|Travancore University]] (1937) presently [[University of Kerala]], [[Sri Venkateswara University]] (1954), [[Madurai Kamaraj University]] (1966), [[Bharathidasan University]] (1982), [[Bharathiar University]] (1982), [[Manonmaniam Sundaranar University]] (1990), [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] (1971), [[Anna University]] (1978), [[Tamil University]] (1981), [[Mother Teresa Women's University]] (1984), [[The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R.

In that year the university had 17 departments, 30 teachers, and 69 research scholars. Later the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by the [[Sadler Commission]] and the gains of the University were consolidated by the enactment of the ''Madras University Act'' of 1923. About this time, the territorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from [[Berhampur]] of Odisha in the North East, [[Trivandrum]] of Kerala in the South West, [[Bangalore]] and [[Mangalore]] of Karnataka in the West and [[Hyderabad]] of Andhra Pradesh in the North.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1939, the university published the comprehensive ''[[Tamil Lexicon]]'' dictionary, which is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Kolappan \n  | first = B. \n  | title = Delay, howlers in Tamil Lexicon embarrass scholars \n  | newspaper = The Hindu\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | date = 22 June 2014 \n  | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/delay-howlers-in-tamil-lexicon-embarrass-scholars/article6138747.ece\n  | accessdate = 25 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Coat of arms==\n[[File:University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus.JPG|thumb|University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus]]\n[[File:1937 Madras Legislative Assembly.jpg|thumb|In Senate House: A view of the [[Madras Legislative Assembly]] in 1937.]]\nThe description of the [[Coat of Arms]] of the university, designed in 1857, is:\n<blockquote>\n\"Argent ''(silver or white)'' on a Mount issuant from the basement a Tiger passant proper ''(walking and coloured naturally)'', on a Chief Sable ''(black across the top)'', a Pale Or ''(a gold or yellow vertical strip down the centre 1/3 of the top or chief)'', thereon, between two Elephants heads couped of the field, a lotus flower leaved and slipped of the third, together with this motto ''Doctrina Vim Promovet Insitam''\".\n</blockquote>\nThe coat of arms colours are: the base is light green, the tiger is yellow on a white background, the elephant is grey on a black background, the lotus is a white flower with olive green leaves, on a gold background.

Schaya Iangar, a Madras University Professor, taken in the 1860s by a photographer from the [[Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai|Madras School of Industrial Arts]]]]\nThe first ever demand for higher education in [[Madras Presidency]] was given in a public address to [[John Elphinstone, 13th Lord Elphinstone|Lord John Elphinstone]], Governor of Madras, signed by 70,000 residents when the Governor in Council was contemplating \"some effective and liberal measures for the establishment of an improved system of national education.\" This public petition, which was presented by the Advocate General Mr. George Norton on 11 November 1839, pressed the need for an English college in the city of Madras. Pursuant to this, Lord Elphinstone evolved a plan for the establishment of a central collegiate institution or a \u2018university.\u2019 This university had twin departments&nbsp;\u2013 a high school for the cultivation of English literature, regional language, philosophy and science, and a college for instruction in the higher branches of literature, philosophy and science.\n\nThe University Board was constituted in January 1840 with Mr. George Norton as its president. This was the precursor of the present [[Presidency College, Chennai]]. A systematic educational policy for India was formulated 14 years later by [[Wood's despatch]], which pointed out the rationale for \"creating a properly articulated system of education from the primary school to the University.\" The Dispatch recommended the establishment in the universities of Professorships \"for the purposes of the delivery of lectures in various branches of learning including vernacular as well as classical languages.\" As a result, the University of Madras, organised on the model of the University of London, was incorporated on 5 September 1857 by an Act of the [[Council of India|Legislative Council of India]].\n\nThe university progressed and expanded through the 19th century to span the whole of [[South India]], giving birth to universities like [[Mysore University]] (1916), [[Osmania University]] (1918), [[Andhra University]] (1926), [[Annamalai University]] (1929), [[University of Kerala|Travancore University]] (1937) presently [[University of Kerala]], [[Sri Venkateswara University]] (1954), [[Madurai Kamaraj University]] (1966), [[Bharathidasan University]] (1982), [[Bharathiar University]] (1982), [[Manonmaniam Sundaranar University]] (1990), [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] (1971), [[Anna University]] (1978), [[Tamil University]] (1981), [[Mother Teresa Women's University]] (1984), [[The Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R.

In that year the university had 17 departments, 30 teachers, and 69 research scholars. Later the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by the [[Sadler Commission]] and the gains of the University were consolidated by the enactment of the ''Madras University Act'' of 1923. About this time, the territorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from [[Berhampur]] of Odisha in the North East, [[Trivandrum]] of Kerala in the South West, [[Bangalore]] and [[Mangalore]] of Karnataka in the West and [[Hyderabad]] of Andhra Pradesh in the North.\n\nBetween 1926 and 1939, the university published the comprehensive ''[[Tamil Lexicon]]'' dictionary, which is the first among the dictionaries published in any Indian language.<ref>{{cite news \n  | last = Kolappan \n  | first = B. \n  | title = Delay, howlers in Tamil Lexicon embarrass scholars \n  | newspaper = The Hindu\n  | location = Chennai\n  | pages = \n  | language = \n  | date = 22 June 2014 \n  | url = http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/delay-howlers-in-tamil-lexicon-embarrass-scholars/article6138747.ece\n  | accessdate = 25 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Coat of arms==\n[[File:University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus.JPG|thumb|University of Madras Entrance Arch at Chepauk Campus]]\n[[File:1937 Madras Legislative Assembly.jpg|thumb|In Senate House: A view of the [[Madras Legislative Assembly]] in 1937.]]\nThe description of the [[Coat of Arms]] of the university, designed in 1857, is:\n<blockquote>\n\"Argent ''(silver or white)'' on a Mount issuant from the basement a Tiger passant proper ''(walking and coloured naturally)'', on a Chief Sable ''(black across the top)'', a Pale Or ''(a gold or yellow vertical strip down the centre 1/3 of the top or chief)'', thereon, between two Elephants heads couped of the field, a lotus flower leaved and slipped of the third, together with this motto ''Doctrina Vim Promovet Insitam''\".\n</blockquote>\nThe coat of arms colours are: the base is light green, the tiger is yellow on a white background, the elephant is grey on a black background, the lotus is a white flower with olive green leaves, on a gold background.

Sylvan Hills' administration officials were enforcing the PCSSD policy regarding cell phone use by students while in the classroom, which is a violation of the PCSSD Student Handbook.  According to the district's handbook, such a violation allows officials to confiscate the phone for two weeks before returning the device. These actions eventually resulted in the lawsuit ''Koch v. Adams'' on the basis that the officials' actions resulted in [[Conversion (law)|conversion]] and [[trespass to chattels]]. The trial court dismissed the case, which subsequently led to the case being heard by the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]], which by unanimous decision had upheld the school district's policy and the lower court's decision to allow such confiscation and that no violation of state or federal policy occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://courts.arkansas.gov/court_opinions/sc/2010a/20100318/Koch%20v.%20Adams.pdf |title=2010 Ark. 131 |last1=Brown, Associate Judge |first=Robert L. |publisher=Arkansas Supreme Court |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}</ref> As school districts around the United States have similar policies regarding students' cell phone use in classrooms, this legal decision has been widely discussed in the education community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsba.org/TEMP/LegalClips/Koch-v-Adams.html |title=Arkansas Supreme Court upholds school officials' confiscation of student's cell phone |publisher=National School Boards Association |access-date=August 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307081823/http://www.nsba.org/TEMP/LegalClips/Koch-v-Adams.html |archive-date=March 7, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iapss-in.org/subsite/dist/page/may-2010-legal-issues-236 |title=Students Rights & Discipline, Arkansas Supreme Court upholds school officials' confiscation of student's cell phone |publisher=Indiana Association of Public School Superintendents |accessdate=September 19, 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\nSince 1993, Sylvan Hills High School has been an institutional member of The College Board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apps.collegeboard.org/cbsearch/searchMInstitution.jsp?searchaction=display&PAGECOUNT=20&STARTPAGE=80 |title=Institutional Member : Search > Arkansas |publisher=College Board |accessdate=November 15, 2013}}</ref> In 2008, Sylvan Hills was recognized with an Arkansas Picturing America Award,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://picturingamerica.neh.gov/ |title=Picturing America |access-date=November 12, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123084231/https://picturingamerica.neh.gov/ |archive-date=November 23, 2016  }} NEH Picture America</ref> which is an initiative by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] that brings masterpieces of American art into classrooms and libraries nationwide.\n\nA Sylvan Hills student was named one of Arkansas' top two youth volunteers for 2009 by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, a nationwide program honoring young people for acts of voluntarism.

Sylvan Hills' administration officials were enforcing the PCSSD policy regarding cell phone use by students while in the classroom, which is a violation of the PCSSD Student Handbook.  According to the district's handbook, such a violation allows officials to confiscate the phone for two weeks before returning the device. These actions eventually resulted in the lawsuit ''Koch v. Adams'' on the basis that the officials' actions resulted in [[Conversion (law)|conversion]] and [[trespass to chattels]]. The trial court dismissed the case, which subsequently led to the case being heard by the [[Arkansas Supreme Court]], which by unanimous decision had upheld the school district's policy and the lower court's decision to allow such confiscation and that no violation of state or federal policy occurred.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://courts.arkansas.gov/court_opinions/sc/2010a/20100318/Koch%20v.%20Adams.pdf |title=2010 Ark. 131 |last1=Brown, Associate Judge |first=Robert L. |publisher=Arkansas Supreme Court |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}</ref> As school districts around the United States have similar policies regarding students' cell phone use in classrooms, this legal decision has been widely discussed in the education community.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nsba.org/TEMP/LegalClips/Koch-v-Adams.html |title=Arkansas Supreme Court upholds school officials' confiscation of student's cell phone |publisher=National School Boards Association |access-date=August 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307081823/http://www.nsba.org/TEMP/LegalClips/Koch-v-Adams.html |archive-date=March 7, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iapss-in.org/subsite/dist/page/may-2010-legal-issues-236 |title=Students Rights & Discipline, Arkansas Supreme Court upholds school officials' confiscation of student's cell phone |publisher=Indiana Association of Public School Superintendents |accessdate=September 19, 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\nSince 1993, Sylvan Hills High School has been an institutional member of The College Board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apps.collegeboard.org/cbsearch/searchMInstitution.jsp?searchaction=display&PAGECOUNT=20&STARTPAGE=80 |title=Institutional Member : Search > Arkansas |publisher=College Board |accessdate=November 15, 2013}}</ref> In 2008, Sylvan Hills was recognized with an Arkansas Picturing America Award,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://picturingamerica.neh.gov/ |title=Picturing America |access-date=November 12, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123084231/https://picturingamerica.neh.gov/ |archive-date=November 23, 2016  }} NEH Picture America</ref> which is an initiative by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] that brings masterpieces of American art into classrooms and libraries nationwide.\n\nA Sylvan Hills student was named one of Arkansas' top two youth volunteers for 2009 by The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, a nationwide program honoring young people for acts of voluntarism.
