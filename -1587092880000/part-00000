Some believe that capitalism can only be overcome through revolution, and some believe that structural change can come slowly through [[Reformism|political reforms]]. Some critics believe there are merits in capitalism and wish to balance it with some form of social control, typically through government regulation (e.g. the [[social market]] movement).\n\nProminent among critiques of capitalism are accusations that capitalism is inherently [[Wage slavery|exploitative]], that it is [[unsustainable]], that it creates [[economic inequality]], that it is anti-democratic and leads to an erosion of [[human rights]] and that it incentivizes [[imperialist]] expansion and [[Military\u2013industrial complex|war]].\n\n== History ==\n{{socialism sidebar}}\nAccording to contemporary critics{{quantify|date=April 2010}} of capitalism, [[Industrial Revolution|rapid industrialization]] in Europe created working conditions viewed as unfair, including [[8-hour day|14-hour work days]], [[child labor]] and [[shanty towns]].<ref name=\"conditionsworking\">{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = The Condition of the Working Class in England | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-16}}</ref> Some modern economists argue that average living standards did not improve, or only very slowly improved, before 1840.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html|title=Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living|author=Clark Nardinelli, economist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|work=The concise encyclopedia of economics|publisher=The Library of Economics and Liberty|accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref>\n\nEarly [[Socialism|socialist]] thinkers rejected capitalism altogether, attempting to create socialist communities free of the perceived injustices of early capitalism. Among these [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]] were [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]]. In 1848, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] released ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', which outlined a political and economic critique of capitalism based on the philosophy of [[historical materialism]]. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], a contemporary of Marx, was another notable critic of capitalism and was one of the first to call himself an [[Anarchism|anarchist]].\n\nBy the early 20th century, myriad socialist tendencies (e.g. [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[social democracy]] and [[Bolshevism]]) had arisen based on different interpretations of current events. Governments also began placing restrictions on market operations and created [[Economic interventionism|interventionist programs]], attempting to ameliorate perceived market shortcomings (e.g. [[Keynesian economics]] and the [[New Deal]]). Starting with the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], [[Communist state]]s increased in numbers and a [[Cold War]] started with the developed capitalist nations. Following the [[Revolutions of 1989]], many of these Communist states adopted [[market economy|market economies]]. The notable exceptions to this trend have been North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela, the latter instituting a philosophy referred to as \"[[socialism of the 21st century]]\".\n\n== General criticism ==\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{anarchism sidebar}}\n{{see also|Anarchism|Libertarian socialism}}\nThe authors of ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' state that anarchists have long recognised that capitalism is by its very nature hierarchical. The worker is subjected to the authority of the boss during working hours (sometimes outside work too). They state: \"This hierarchical control of wage labour has the effect of alienating workers from their own work, and so from themselves. Workers no longer govern themselves during work hours and so are no longer free\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |title=\"B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical? by An Anarchist FAQ |access-date=2014-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428084157/http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |archive-date=2014-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to them, this is why \"[c]apitalism, by treating labour as analogous to all other commodities denies the key distinction between labour and other \"resources\"\u2014that is to say its inseparability from its bearer\u2014labour, unlike other \"property,\" is endowed with will and agency. Thus when one speaks of selling labour there is a necessary subjugation of will (hierarchy)... Creative, self-managed work is a source of pride and joy and part of what it means to be fully human. Wrenching control of work from the hands of the worker profoundly harms his or her mental and physical health. Capitalism itself was created by state violence and the destruction of traditional ways of life and social interaction was part of that task. From the start, bosses spent considerable time and energy combating attempts of working people to join together to resist the hierarchy they were subjected to and reassert human values. Such forms of free association between equals (such as trade unions) were combated, just as attempts to regulate the worse excesses of the system by democratic governments. Indeed, capitalists prefer centralized, elitist and/or authoritarian regimes precisely because they are sure to be outside of popular control (see section B.2.5). They are the only way that contractual relations based on market power could be enforced on an unwilling population\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |title=\"B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical?\" by An Anarchist FAQ |access-date=2014-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428084157/http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |archive-date=2014-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFor the influential German [[individualist anarchist]] philosopher [[Max Stirner]], [[private property]] is a \"spook\" which \"lives by the grace of law\" and \"becomes 'mine' only by effect of the law\". In other words, private property exists purely \"through the protection of the State, through the State's grace\". Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner is also aware that \"[i]t need not make any difference to the 'good citizens' who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic, if only they are protected. And what is their principle, whose protector they always 'love'?

In this sense, they seek to abolish capital. They believe that private ownership of the means of production enriches capitalists (owners of capital) at the expense of workers (\"[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]\"). In brief, they argue that the owners of the means of production do not work and therefore [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploit]] the workforce. In Marx's view, the capitalists would eventually accumulate more and more capital impoverishing the working class, creating the social conditions for a revolution that would overthrow the institutions of capitalism. Private ownership over the means of production and distribution is seen as a dependency of non-owning classes on the ruling class and ultimately a source of restriction of human freedom.\n\nMarxists have offered various related lines of argument claiming that capitalism is a contradiction-laden system characterized by recurring crises coming from the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] and having a tendency towards increasing severity. Capitalism is seen as just one stage in the evolution of the economic system. [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], approaching matters from a world-systems perspective, cites the intransigence of rising real wages, rising costs of material inputs and steadily rising tax rates, along with the rise of popular antisystemic movements as the most important global secular trends creating unprecedented limiting pressures on the accumulation of capital. According to Wallerstein, \"the capitalist world-economy has now entered its terminal crisis, a crisis that may last up to fifty years. The real question before us is what will happen during this crisis, this transition from the present world-system to some other kind of historical system or systems\".<ref>Wallerstein, Immanuel. ''The Decline of American Power'', New Press Books, p. 66</ref>\n\nIn [[mainland China]], differences in terminology sometimes confuse and complicate discussions of [[Chinese economic reform]]. Under Marxist ideology, capitalism refers to a stage of history in which there is a class system in which the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie. Officially, according to the Chinese governments state ideology, China is currently in the [[primary stage of socialism]]. However, because of [[Deng Xiaoping]] and subsequent leaders' Chinese economic reforms, instituting [[pragmatism]] within policy, China has undertaken policies that are commonly considered capitalistic, including employing wage labor, increasing unemployment to motivate those who are still working,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} transforming state owned enterprises into joint stock companies and encouraging the growth of the joint venture and private capitalist sectors. A contrary Marxist view would describe China as just another variant of capitalism ([[state capitalism]]), much like the former Soviet Union, which was also claiming to be operating on principals of socialism. This is echoed by what [[Mao Zedong]] termed \"[[capitalist roader]]s\", who he argued existed within the ruling party structures and would try to restore the bourgeoisie and thus their class interests to power reflected in new policies while only keeping the outer appearance of socialism for legitimacy purposes. Deng Xiaoping was identified as one of these \"capitalist roaders\" during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when he was placed under house arrest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{see also|Christian communism|Christian left|Christian socialism|Islamic socialism|Jewish left|Liberation theology|Religious communism|Social Gospel}}\nThe [[Catholic Church]] forbids [[usury]].<ref name=\"m6\">{{cite journal|ref=harv| doi=10.2307/3161033|page=6|jstor=3161033|title=The Christianization of Interest|journal=Church History|volume=3|issue=1|year=1934|last1=Moehlman|first1=Conrad Henry|author-link=Conrad Henry Moehlman}}</ref><ref name=\"Nicea I\">{{cite web|title=First Council of Nicea (A.D. 325)|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3801.htm| access-date = September 4, 2019 |publisher=New Advent|website=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref name=\"Lateran III\">{{cite web|title=Third Lateran Council \u2013 1179 A.D. \u2013 Papal Encyclicals|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum11.htm| access-date = September 4, 2019 |publisher=Papal Encyclicals Online|website=papalencyclicals.net|date=March 5, 1179}}</ref> As established by papal [[encyclicals]] ''[[Rerum Novarum]]'' and ''[[Quadragesimo Anno]]'', [[Catholic social teaching]] does not support unrestricted capitalism, primarily because it is considered part of [[liberalism]] and secondly by its nature, which goes against social justice.

Some critics believe there are merits in capitalism and wish to balance it with some form of social control, typically through government regulation (e.g. the [[social market]] movement).\n\nProminent among critiques of capitalism are accusations that capitalism is inherently [[Wage slavery|exploitative]], that it is [[unsustainable]], that it creates [[economic inequality]], that it is anti-democratic and leads to an erosion of [[human rights]] and that it incentivizes [[imperialist]] expansion and [[Military\u2013industrial complex|war]].\n\n== History ==\n{{socialism sidebar}}\nAccording to contemporary critics{{quantify|date=April 2010}} of capitalism, [[Industrial Revolution|rapid industrialization]] in Europe created working conditions viewed as unfair, including [[8-hour day|14-hour work days]], [[child labor]] and [[shanty towns]].<ref name=\"conditionsworking\">{{cite web | last = Engels | first = Frederick | title = The Condition of the Working Class in England | url = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-16}}</ref> Some modern economists argue that average living standards did not improve, or only very slowly improved, before 1840.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html|title=Industrial Revolution and the Standard of Living|author=Clark Nardinelli, economist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|work=The concise encyclopedia of economics|publisher=The Library of Economics and Liberty|accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref>\n\nEarly [[Socialism|socialist]] thinkers rejected capitalism altogether, attempting to create socialist communities free of the perceived injustices of early capitalism. Among these [[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]] were [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]]. In 1848, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] released ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', which outlined a political and economic critique of capitalism based on the philosophy of [[historical materialism]]. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], a contemporary of Marx, was another notable critic of capitalism and was one of the first to call himself an [[Anarchism|anarchist]].\n\nBy the early 20th century, myriad socialist tendencies (e.g. [[anarcho-syndicalism]], [[social democracy]] and [[Bolshevism]]) had arisen based on different interpretations of current events. Governments also began placing restrictions on market operations and created [[Economic interventionism|interventionist programs]], attempting to ameliorate perceived market shortcomings (e.g. [[Keynesian economics]] and the [[New Deal]]). Starting with the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], [[Communist state]]s increased in numbers and a [[Cold War]] started with the developed capitalist nations. Following the [[Revolutions of 1989]], many of these Communist states adopted [[market economy|market economies]]. The notable exceptions to this trend have been North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela, the latter instituting a philosophy referred to as \"[[socialism of the 21st century]]\".\n\n== General criticism ==\n=== Anarchism ===\n{{anarchism sidebar}}\n{{see also|Anarchism|Libertarian socialism}}\nThe authors of ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' state that anarchists have long recognised that capitalism is by its very nature hierarchical. The worker is subjected to the authority of the boss during working hours (sometimes outside work too). They state: \"This hierarchical control of wage labour has the effect of alienating workers from their own work, and so from themselves. Workers no longer govern themselves during work hours and so are no longer free\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |title=\"B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical? by An Anarchist FAQ |access-date=2014-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428084157/http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |archive-date=2014-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to them, this is why \"[c]apitalism, by treating labour as analogous to all other commodities denies the key distinction between labour and other \"resources\"\u2014that is to say its inseparability from its bearer\u2014labour, unlike other \"property,\" is endowed with will and agency. Thus when one speaks of selling labour there is a necessary subjugation of will (hierarchy)... Creative, self-managed work is a source of pride and joy and part of what it means to be fully human. Wrenching control of work from the hands of the worker profoundly harms his or her mental and physical health. Capitalism itself was created by state violence and the destruction of traditional ways of life and social interaction was part of that task. From the start, bosses spent considerable time and energy combating attempts of working people to join together to resist the hierarchy they were subjected to and reassert human values. Such forms of free association between equals (such as trade unions) were combated, just as attempts to regulate the worse excesses of the system by democratic governments. Indeed, capitalists prefer centralized, elitist and/or authoritarian regimes precisely because they are sure to be outside of popular control (see section B.2.5). They are the only way that contractual relations based on market power could be enforced on an unwilling population\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |title=\"B.1.2 Is capitalism hierarchical?\" by An Anarchist FAQ |access-date=2014-04-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428084157/http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionB1#secb12 |archive-date=2014-04-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFor the influential German [[individualist anarchist]] philosopher [[Max Stirner]], [[private property]] is a \"spook\" which \"lives by the grace of law\" and \"becomes 'mine' only by effect of the law\". In other words, private property exists purely \"through the protection of the State, through the State's grace\". Recognising its need for state protection, Stirner is also aware that \"[i]t need not make any difference to the 'good citizens' who protects them and their principles, whether an absolute King or a constitutional one, a republic, if only they are protected.

In this sense, they seek to abolish capital. They believe that private ownership of the means of production enriches capitalists (owners of capital) at the expense of workers (\"[[the rich get richer and the poor get poorer]]\"). In brief, they argue that the owners of the means of production do not work and therefore [[Exploitation of labour#Marxist theory|exploit]] the workforce. In Marx's view, the capitalists would eventually accumulate more and more capital impoverishing the working class, creating the social conditions for a revolution that would overthrow the institutions of capitalism. Private ownership over the means of production and distribution is seen as a dependency of non-owning classes on the ruling class and ultimately a source of restriction of human freedom.\n\nMarxists have offered various related lines of argument claiming that capitalism is a contradiction-laden system characterized by recurring crises coming from the [[tendency of the rate of profit to fall]] and having a tendency towards increasing severity. Capitalism is seen as just one stage in the evolution of the economic system. [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], approaching matters from a world-systems perspective, cites the intransigence of rising real wages, rising costs of material inputs and steadily rising tax rates, along with the rise of popular antisystemic movements as the most important global secular trends creating unprecedented limiting pressures on the accumulation of capital. According to Wallerstein, \"the capitalist world-economy has now entered its terminal crisis, a crisis that may last up to fifty years. The real question before us is what will happen during this crisis, this transition from the present world-system to some other kind of historical system or systems\".<ref>Wallerstein, Immanuel. ''The Decline of American Power'', New Press Books, p. 66</ref>\n\nIn [[mainland China]], differences in terminology sometimes confuse and complicate discussions of [[Chinese economic reform]]. Under Marxist ideology, capitalism refers to a stage of history in which there is a class system in which the proletariat is exploited by the bourgeoisie. Officially, according to the Chinese governments state ideology, China is currently in the [[primary stage of socialism]]. However, because of [[Deng Xiaoping]] and subsequent leaders' Chinese economic reforms, instituting [[pragmatism]] within policy, China has undertaken policies that are commonly considered capitalistic, including employing wage labor, increasing unemployment to motivate those who are still working,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} transforming state owned enterprises into joint stock companies and encouraging the growth of the joint venture and private capitalist sectors. A contrary Marxist view would describe China as just another variant of capitalism ([[state capitalism]]), much like the former Soviet Union, which was also claiming to be operating on principals of socialism. This is echoed by what [[Mao Zedong]] termed \"[[capitalist roader]]s\", who he argued existed within the ruling party structures and would try to restore the bourgeoisie and thus their class interests to power reflected in new policies while only keeping the outer appearance of socialism for legitimacy purposes. Deng Xiaoping was identified as one of these \"capitalist roaders\" during the [[Cultural Revolution]], when he was placed under house arrest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{see also|Christian communism|Christian left|Christian socialism|Islamic socialism|Jewish left|Liberation theology|Religious communism|Social Gospel}}\nThe [[Catholic Church]] forbids [[usury]].<ref name=\"m6\">{{cite journal|ref=harv| doi=10.2307/3161033|page=6|jstor=3161033|title=The Christianization of Interest|journal=Church History|volume=3|issue=1|year=1934|last1=Moehlman|first1=Conrad Henry|author-link=Conrad Henry Moehlman}}</ref><ref name=\"Nicea I\">{{cite web|title=First Council of Nicea (A.D. 325)|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3801.htm| access-date = September 4, 2019 |publisher=New Advent|website=newadvent.org}}</ref><ref name=\"Lateran III\">{{cite web|title=Third Lateran Council \u2013 1179 A.D. \u2013 Papal Encyclicals|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Councils/ecum11.htm| access-date = September 4, 2019 |publisher=Papal Encyclicals Online|website=papalencyclicals.net|date=March 5, 1179}}</ref> As established by papal [[encyclicals]] ''[[Rerum Novarum]]'' and ''[[Quadragesimo Anno]]'', [[Catholic social teaching]] does not support unrestricted capitalism, primarily because it is considered part of [[liberalism]] and secondly by its nature, which goes against social justice.

It is the [[English language|English]] version of the [[French language|French]] name [[Jos\u00e9phine]]. In Greece the female name Josephine is (Io\u0331si\u0331f\u00edna) and is used mainly on the island of Crete in Greece. The feminine form of the name [[Joseph (name)|Joseph]], which is taken from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] name Yosef, meaning \"([[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]]) shall grow.\"\n\n==Variations==\nOriginally a diminutive form of the French name ''Jos\u00e9phe'', Jos\u00e9phine became the standard form in the 19th century, replacing ''Jos\u00e9phe'', which eventually became a very rare name. In 2017, Josephine was the 107th most popular girls' baby name in the USA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi|title=Popular Baby Names|last=OACT|website=www.ssa.gov|access-date=2018-05-28}}</ref> Diminutive forms of this name include Fifi, Jo, [[Josie (disambiguation)|Josie]], Joetta and Jojo. Other language variants include the Irish version Seosaimh\u00edn, the Spanish version [[Josefina (disambiguation)|Josefina]] or [[Josephina (disambiguation)|Josephina]], and the Greek version Iosiphina ([[Greek language|Greek]]: \u0399\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c6\u03af\u03bd\u03b1). Alternate spellings include Yosefina and Gosefine. The Swedish version is Josefine.\n\nThe name started gaining popularity after 1800 due to the high profile of [[Josephine de Beauharnais|Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]], a French noblewoman who became [[Napoleon]]'s mistress and later his wife and [[First French Empire|Empress of the French]].\n\n== Translations ==\n* \u062c\u0648\u0632\u0641\u064a\u0646 '''(Arabic)'''\n* *

When the Iron Bowl became a home-and-home series in 1988, Alabama continued to host its home games in the series at Legion Field in even-numbered years through 1998. The Crimson Tide hosted Tennessee in odd-numbered years in Birmingham until 1999, and LSU in even-numbered years from 1964 through 1986, except for 1980. Usually, Bryant\u2013Denny hosted three or four games per season, mostly non-conference games, although the Tide always played Mississippi State in Tuscaloosa, save for 1987, due to the close distance between Tuscaloosa and [[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville]]. However, in 1998, when Bryant\u2013Denny was expanded to a capacity exceeding Legion Field, the more important home games started to move to Bryant\u2013Denny, culminating with the move of the Tennessee series to Tuscaloosa in 1999 and the Iron Bowl a year later.<ref name=\"March 6, 1999\">{{cite news |title=Vols Due in Fall, AU in 2000|first=Cecil|last=Hurt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6ckdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VqYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6026%2C631746|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=March 6, 1999|accessdate=February 3, 2011|page=1}}</ref> From 1998 to 2003, Alabama continued to play two or three minor games in Birmingham.

In recent years, Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium has become a feared place to play again.  Also Bryant-Denny has been put on many lists ranking it one of the best places to watch football. [[NCAA Football 11]] ranked Alabama's Bryant\u2013Denny as the fourth toughest place to play in the nation and third in the SEC behind [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium|Florida]] and [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|LSU]].

As more and more stadiums began to add other designs to the field, such as logos, Alabama chose to remain traditional with the field design. In fact, even into the 2002 season, Bryant\u2013Denny still had no logo at midfield and no logos at the 25-yard lines, which are now commonplace in many stadiums. The end zone design simply consisted of \"ALABAMA\" in a white, block-style font. During the 1992 season, however, a special logo was used at midfield to commemorate the centennial season of Alabama football.\n\nDuring the 2002 season, however, a large white script \u201cA\u201d was added to midfield. The field design underwent full-scale changes beginning with the 2004 season. At midfield, the large white script \u201cA\u201d was replaced with the crimson script \u201cA\u201d logo, encircled by a crimson ring which has \"Alabama Crimson Tide\" written around it. In addition, the end zone designs were changed to a crimson block-style font outlined in white.\n\nFor the 2006 season, two identical logos commemorating the 175th anniversary of the university were also added to the field on the 25-yard lines. One was added on the south end of the stadium, on the west side of the playing field, while the other was on the north end of the stadium, on the east side of the playing field.\n\n[[File:2011 houndstooth ribbon on the field at Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|alt=American football field with a houndstooth awareness ribbon painted on it.|left|Detail of the [[houndstooth]] [[awareness ribbon]] painted on-field in remembrance of the victims and damage of the April 2011 tornado.]]\nFor the 2007 season, two identical logos commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) were added to home field of every SEC team.

The north end zone displayed \"ALABAMA\", while the south end zone displayed \"CRIMSON TIDE\".

As such, until the late 1990s, Legion Field hosted most of Alabama's important home games. The most notable of these games was the [[Iron Bowl]] with rival [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]]. Legion Field was considered a neutral site from 1948 through 1987. When the Iron Bowl became a home-and-home series in 1988, Alabama continued to host its home games in the series at Legion Field in even-numbered years through 1998. The Crimson Tide hosted Tennessee in odd-numbered years in Birmingham until 1999, and LSU in even-numbered years from 1964 through 1986, except for 1980. Usually, Bryant\u2013Denny hosted three or four games per season, mostly non-conference games, although the Tide always played Mississippi State in Tuscaloosa, save for 1987, due to the close distance between Tuscaloosa and [[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville]]. However, in 1998, when Bryant\u2013Denny was expanded to a capacity exceeding Legion Field, the more important home games started to move to Bryant\u2013Denny, culminating with the move of the Tennessee series to Tuscaloosa in 1999 and the Iron Bowl a year later.<ref name=\"March 6, 1999\">{{cite news |title=Vols Due in Fall, AU in 2000|first=Cecil|last=Hurt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6ckdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VqYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6026%2C631746|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=March 6, 1999|accessdate=February 3, 2011|page=1}}</ref> From 1998 to 2003, Alabama continued to play two or three minor games in Birmingham.

[[NCAA Football 11]] ranked Alabama's Bryant\u2013Denny as the fourth toughest place to play in the nation and third in the SEC behind [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium|Florida]] and [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|LSU]].

As more and more stadiums began to add other designs to the field, such as logos, Alabama chose to remain traditional with the field design. In fact, even into the 2002 season, Bryant\u2013Denny still had no logo at midfield and no logos at the 25-yard lines, which are now commonplace in many stadiums. The end zone design simply consisted of \"ALABAMA\" in a white, block-style font. During the 1992 season, however, a special logo was used at midfield to commemorate the centennial season of Alabama football.\n\nDuring the 2002 season, however, a large white script \u201cA\u201d was added to midfield. The field design underwent full-scale changes beginning with the 2004 season. At midfield, the large white script \u201cA\u201d was replaced with the crimson script \u201cA\u201d logo, encircled by a crimson ring which has \"Alabama Crimson Tide\" written around it. In addition, the end zone designs were changed to a crimson block-style font outlined in white.\n\nFor the 2006 season, two identical logos commemorating the 175th anniversary of the university were also added to the field on the 25-yard lines. One was added on the south end of the stadium, on the west side of the playing field, while the other was on the north end of the stadium, on the east side of the playing field.\n\n[[File:2011 houndstooth ribbon on the field at Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|alt=American football field with a houndstooth awareness ribbon painted on it.|left|Detail of the [[houndstooth]] [[awareness ribbon]] painted on-field in remembrance of the victims and damage of the April 2011 tornado.]]\nFor the 2007 season, two identical logos commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) were added to home field of every SEC team.

Among his most famous [[title sequence]]s are the animated paper cut-out of a heroin addict's arm for Preminger's ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'', the credits racing up and down what eventually becomes a high-angle shot of a skyscraper in Hitchcock's ''[[North by Northwest]]'', and the disjointed text that races together and apart in ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''.\n\nBass designed some of the most iconic corporate logos in North America, including the [[Bell System]] logo in 1969, as well as [[American Telephone & Telegraph Company|AT&T]]'s globe logo in 1983 after the [[Bell System divestiture|breakup of the Bell System]]. He also designed [[Continental Airlines]]' 1968 jet stream logo and [[United Airlines]]' 1974 tulip logo, which became some of the most recognized airline industry logos of the era. He died from [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]] in Los Angeles on April 25, 1996, at the age of 75.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1996-04-27-9604260612-story.html|title=SAUL BASS, 75, LOGO AND TRADEMARK DESIGNER|first=Los Angeles|last=Times|website=Sun-Sentinel.com}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nSaul Bass was born on May 8, 1920 in [[the Bronx]], New York, United States, to Eastern European Jewish immigrant parents.

His next collaboration with Preminger was to design a [[film poster]] for his 1954 film ''[[Carmen Jones (film)|Carmen Jones]]''. Preminger was so impressed with Bass's work that he asked him to produce the title sequence as well. This was when Bass first saw the opportunity to create a title sequence which would ultimately enhance the experience of the audience and contribute to the mood and the theme of the movie within the opening moments. Bass was one of the first to realize the creative potential of the opening and closing credits of a movie.\n\n==Film title sequences==\n\n\n\nIn 1955, [[Elaine Makatura Bass|Elaine Makatura]] came to work with Bass in his Los Angeles office. By 1960, with the opening to ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', she was directing and producing title sequences, and in 1961 the two married, beginning more than 40 years of close collaboration. After the birth of their children, Jennifer in 1964 and Jeffrey in 1967, they concentrated on their family, film directing, and title sequences. Saul and Elaine designed title sequences for more than 40 years, continuously experimenting with a variety of innovative techniques and effects, from [[Bunraku]]-style maneuvers in ''[[Spartacus]]'' (1960), live-action sequences in ''[[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|Walk On The Wild Side]]'' (1962), to time-lapse photography in ''[[The Age of Innocence]]'' (1993), and even chopped liver in ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'' (1992). Their live-action opening title sequences often served as prologues to their films and transitioned seamlessly into their opening scenes. These \"time before\" title sequences either compress or expand time with startling results. The title sequence to ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' (1966) portrays the moments before the opening race in Monte Carlo, the title sequence to ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958) depicts the days it takes a stage coach to travel to a remote Western town, and the opening montage title sequence to ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963) chronicles the twenty-seven years between World War I and the middle of World War II, where the film begins.\n\nFrom the mid-1960s to the late '80s, Saul and Elaine moved away from main titles to focus on filmmaking and their children. About this time away from title design, Saul said:<ref>{{cite web|title=Saul Bass|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/designer/saul-bass/|website=Art of the Title|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Elaine and I feel we are there to serve the film and to approach the task with a sense of responsibility.

At the same time, an increasing number of directors now sought to open their own films in ambitious ways rather than hire someone else to do it. Whatever the reasons, the result was \"Fade Out.\" We did not worry about it: we had too many other interesting projects to get on with. Equally, because we still loved the process of making titles, we were happy to take it up again when asked. \"Fade In\"...<ref>Jennifer Bass and Pat Kirkham, ''Saul Bass: A Life in Film & Design'', Laurence King Publishing, 2011, p. 264</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1980s, Saul and Elaine were rediscovered by [[James L.

This later work with [[Martin Scorsese]] saw the Basses move away from the optical techniques that Saul had pioneered and move into the use of computerized effects. The Basses' title sequences featured new and innovative methods of production and startling [[graphic design]].\n\nScreenwriter [[Nicholas Pileggi]] said of Saul and Elaine Bass, \"You write a book of 300 to 400 pages and then you boil it down to a script of maybe 100 to 150 pages. Eventually you have the pleasure of seeing that the Basses have knocked you right out of the ballpark. They have boiled it down to four minutes flat.\"<ref>Jennifer Bass and Pat Kirkham, Saul Bass: A Life in Film & Design, Laurence King Publishing, 2011, pg.263</ref>\n\nIn a sense, all modern opening title sequences that introduce the mood or theme of a film can be seen as a legacy of the Basses' innovative work. In particular, title sequences for some recent movies and television series, especially those whose setting is during the 1960s, have purposely emulated the graphic style of Saul Bass's animated sequences from the 1950s. Some examples of title sequences that pay homage to Bass's graphics and animated title sequences are ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (2002),<ref>[http://www.artofthetitle.com/2011/08/22/catch-me-if-you-can/ Interview with Olivier Kuntzel and Florence Degas, designers of the ''Catch Me If You Can'' title sequence].

Before Bass's seminal poster for ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), movie posters were dominated by depictions of key scenes or characters from the film, often both juxtaposed with each other. Bass's posters, however, typically developed simplified, symbolic designs that visually communicated key essential elements of the film. For example, his poster for ''The Man with the Golden Arm'', with a jagged arm and off-kilter typography, starkly communicates the protagonist's struggle with heroin addiction. Bass's iconic ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) poster, with its stylized figures sucked down into the nucleus of a spiral vortex, captures the anxiety and disorientation central to the film. His poster for ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1959), featuring the silhouette of a corpse jarringly dissected into seven pieces, makes both a pun on the film's title and captures the moral ambiguities within which this court room drama is immersed.\n\nHe created some of his best known posters for films directed by [[Otto Preminger]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Billy Wilder]], and [[Stanley Kubrick]] among others.

Bass has the unusual credit of \"visual consultant\" or \"pictorial consultant\" on five films. For ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960), Bass as \"visual consultant\" designed key elements of the gladiator school and storyboarded the final battle between slaves and Romans. [[John Frankenheimer]], the director of ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' (1966), had Bass storyboard, direct, and edit all but one of the racing sequences for his film. For ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961) Bass filmed the prologue, storyboarded the opening dance sequence, and created the ending title sequence.<ref name=\"kirkham2011\"/>\n\nIt is Bass's credited role as \"pictorial consultant\" for Alfred Hitchcock on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960); however, that has caused some controversy and debate. Bass claimed that he participated in directing the highlight scene of ''Psycho'', the tightly edited shower-murder sequence, though several on set at the time (including star [[Janet Leigh]]) disputed this claim.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/02/20/psycho_shower_scene_directed_by_saul_bass_watch_storyboards_side_by_side.html/ Harris, Aisha (February 20, 2014) \"Did Saul Bass Direct the Shower Scene in ''Psycho''?\"] Slate.com. Retrieved 2014-2-23</ref>\n\nThe research of several film scholars on Hitchcock's production of ''Psycho'' validates the claim that Bass in his capacity as a graphic artist did indeed have a significant influence on the visual design and pacing of that famous scene. Hitchcock had asked Bass to design and produce storyboards for the shower murder scene and for some other scenes in the film. For this, Bass received a credit as Pictorial Consultant as well as Title Designer. Janet Leigh told [[Donald Spoto]] that \"the planning of the shower scene was left up to Saul Bass, and Hitchcock followed his storyboard precisely. Because of this ... [the shooting] went very professionally,\"<ref>Spoto, Donald (1999 [1983]). ''The Dark Side Of Genius: The Life Of Alfred Hitchcock''. New York: Da Capo Press. (pp. 454\u2013455)</ref> and she told [[Stephen Rebello]] that \"Mr. Hitchcock showed Saul Bass's storyboards to me quite proudly, telling me in exact detail how he was going to shoot the scene from Saul's plans\".<ref>Rebello, Stephen (1990). ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho''. New York: St. Martin's Griffin. (p. 102) {{ISBN|0-312-20785-9}}.</ref>\n\nBill Krohn has noted that Bass's 48 story board panels for the scene introduced all the key aspects of the final shower murder scene \u2013 most notably, the fact that the attacker appears as a silhouette, close-ups of a slashing knife, the shower curtain torn down, a shot of the shower head from below, Marion's desperate outstretched arm, and the famous shot of the transition from the drain hole of the bathtub to Marion Crane's dead eye. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of Bass's iris titles for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.<ref name=Krohn>Krohn, Bill (2003). ''Hitchcock at Work''. (pp. London: Phaidon Press. (p. 231)</ref> Krohn also concludes that Bass did not literally direct the shower scene, proving Hitchcock's presence on the set throughout the shooting of that scene.<ref name=Krohn/>\n\nBass introduced the idea of using a montage of fast cuts and tight framing to render a violent, bloody murder as an impressionistic and nearly bloodless one. Hitchcock felt uncertain about Bass's conception of the scene fearing that audiences might not accept such a stylized and quickly cut sequence. In an interview with film historian [[Pat Kirkham]], Bass recalled, \"Having designed and storyboarded the shower sequence, I showed it to Hitch. He was uneasy about it. It was very un-Hitchcockian in character. He never used that kind of quick cutting; he loved the long shot\".<ref name=\"kirkham2011\"/>\n\nTo convince Hitchcock that the scene would work as planned, eight days before shooting of the final shower scene, Bass used a newsreel camera and Janet Leigh's stand-in [[Marli Renfro]] to shoot footage on the set to plan the shots in more detail. Working with Hitchcock's editor [[George Tomasini]], he edited this footage following the storyboards to show Hitchcock how the scene could work. In the end, Hitchcock gave his approval but, according to Kirkham, made two additions: a spray of blood on the chest of Marion Crane/Janet Leigh as she slides down the tiles, and a close-up of her belly getting stabbed.<ref name=\"kirkham2011\"/>\n\nIn 1964, Saul and his wife and creative partner [[Elaine Bass|Elaine]] directed the short film ''The Searching Eye'' shown during the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], co-produced with [[Sy Wexler]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pyramidmedia.com/homepage/search-by-title/humanities/searching-eye-detail.html|title=HUMANITIES : Searching Eye, The|website=www.pyramidmedia.com}}</ref> The Basses also directed a short documentary film called ''[[Why Man Creates]]''<ref>[https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/55396-Why-Man-Creates Why Man Creates (1968) Theatrical Cartoon - BCDB]</ref> which won the [[Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject]] in 1968.<ref>[http://nightflight.com/why-man-creates-saul-basss-short-film-on-the-nature-of-creativity/ \u201cWhy Man Creates\u201d: Saul Bass\u2019s short film on the nature of creativity\u2014Night Flight]</ref>  An abbreviated version of that film was broadcast on the first episode of the television newsmagazine ''[[60 Minutes]]''.

He also designed [[Continental Airlines]]' 1968 jet stream logo and [[United Airlines]]' 1974 tulip logo, which became some of the most recognized airline industry logos of the era.

His next collaboration with Preminger was to design a [[film poster]] for his 1954 film ''[[Carmen Jones (film)|Carmen Jones]]''. Preminger was so impressed with Bass's work that he asked him to produce the title sequence as well. This was when Bass first saw the opportunity to create a title sequence which would ultimately enhance the experience of the audience and contribute to the mood and the theme of the movie within the opening moments. Bass was one of the first to realize the creative potential of the opening and closing credits of a movie.\n\n==Film title sequences==\nBass became widely known in the film industry after creating the title sequence for [[Otto Preminger]]'s ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955). The subject of the film was a jazz musician's struggle to overcome his [[heroin addiction]], a taboo subject in the mid-1950s. Bass decided to create an innovative [[title sequence]] to match the film's controversial subject. He chose the arm as the central image, as it is a strong image relating to heroin addiction. The titles featured an animated, white on black paper cut-out arm of a heroin addict. As he hoped, it caused quite a sensation.\n[[File:Anatomy Of A Murder Title Sequence.jpg|thumb|Screen image from Saul Bass's title sequence from ''Anatomy Of A Murder'']]\nFor Alfred Hitchcock, Bass provided effective, memorable title sequences, inventing a new type of [[kinetic typography]], for ''[[North by Northwest]]'' (1959), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), working with [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney]], and ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960). It was this kind of innovative, revolutionary work that made Bass a revered [[graphic designer]]. Before the advent of Bass's title sequences in the 1950s, titles were generally static, separate from the movie, and it was common for them to be projected onto the cinema curtains, the curtains only being raised right before the first scene of the movie.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.granneman.com/2011/04/05/saul-bass-changed-how-audiences-view-movie-credits/ |title=GranneBlog \u00bb Saul Bass changed how audiences view movie credits |publisher=Blog.granneman.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-06}}</ref> In 1960, Bass wrote an article for ''Graphis'' magazine called \"Film Titles \u2013 a New Field for the Graphic Designer,\" which has been revered as a milestone for \"the consecration of the movie credit sequence as a design object.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Film Titles \u2013 a New Field for the Graphic Designer|last=Bass|first=Saul|date=1960|work=Graphis|issue=89|volume=16|access-date=|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Straw|first=Will|year=2010|title=Letters of Introduction: Film Credits and Cityscapes|journal=Design and Culture|volume=2|issue=2}}</ref> One of the most studied film credit designers, Bass is known for integrating a stylistic coherence between the designs and the films in which they appear.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBass once described his main goal for his title sequences as being to \"try to reach for a simple, visual phrase that tells you what the picture is all about and evokes the essence of the story\".<ref>Kael, Pauline. \"One, Two, Three.\" ''[[Film Quarterly]]'' Vol. 15, No. 3. (Spring, 1962): 62\u201365</ref> Another philosophy that Bass described as influencing his title sequences was the goal of getting the audience to see familiar parts of their world in an unfamiliar way. Examples of this or what he described as \"making the ordinary extraordinary\" can be seen in ''[[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|Walk on the Wild Side]]'' (1962) where an ordinary cat becomes a mysterious prowling predator, and in ''[[Nine Hours to Rama]]'' (1963) where the interior workings of a clock become an expansive new landscape.<ref>Bass, Saul (1977) ''Bass on Titles''. Pyramid Films. Santa Monica, CA</ref> In the 1950s, Saul Bass used a variety of techniques, from cut-out animation for ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1958), to fully animated mini-movies such as the epilogue for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Oscar]] winner ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (1956), and live-action sequences.\n\nIn 1955, [[Elaine Makatura Bass|Elaine Makatura]] came to work with Bass in his Los Angeles office. By 1960, with the opening to ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'', she was directing and producing title sequences, and in 1961 the two married, beginning more than 40 years of close collaboration. After the birth of their children, Jennifer in 1964 and Jeffrey in 1967, they concentrated on their family, film directing, and title sequences. Saul and Elaine designed title sequences for more than 40 years, continuously experimenting with a variety of innovative techniques and effects, from [[Bunraku]]-style maneuvers in ''[[Spartacus]]'' (1960), live-action sequences in ''[[Walk on the Wild Side (film)|Walk On The Wild Side]]'' (1962), to time-lapse photography in ''[[The Age of Innocence]]'' (1993), and even chopped liver in ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'' (1992). Their live-action opening title sequences often served as prologues to their films and transitioned seamlessly into their opening scenes. These \"time before\" title sequences either compress or expand time with startling results. The title sequence to ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' (1966) portrays the moments before the opening race in Monte Carlo, the title sequence to ''[[The Big Country]]'' (1958) depicts the days it takes a stage coach to travel to a remote Western town, and the opening montage title sequence to ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963) chronicles the twenty-seven years between World War I and the middle of World War II, where the film begins.\n\nFrom the mid-1960s to the late '80s, Saul and Elaine moved away from main titles to focus on filmmaking and their children. About this time away from title design, Saul said:<ref>{{cite web|title=Saul Bass|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/designer/saul-bass/|website=Art of the Title|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Elaine and I feel we are there to serve the film and to approach the task with a sense of responsibility.

This later work with [[Martin Scorsese]] saw the Basses move away from the optical techniques that Saul had pioneered and move into the use of computerized effects. The Basses' title sequences featured new and innovative methods of production and startling [[graphic design]].\n\nScreenwriter [[Nicholas Pileggi]] said of Saul and Elaine Bass, \"You write a book of 300 to 400 pages and then you boil it down to a script of maybe 100 to 150 pages. Eventually you have the pleasure of seeing that the Basses have knocked you right out of the ballpark.

In particular, title sequences for some recent movies and television series, especially those whose setting is during the 1960s, have purposely emulated the graphic style of Saul Bass's animated sequences from the 1950s.

Before Bass's seminal poster for ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), movie posters were dominated by depictions of key scenes or characters from the film, often both juxtaposed with each other. Bass's posters, however, typically developed simplified, symbolic designs that visually communicated key essential elements of the film. For example, his poster for ''The Man with the Golden Arm'', with a jagged arm and off-kilter typography, starkly communicates the protagonist's struggle with heroin addiction. Bass's iconic ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958) poster, with its stylized figures sucked down into the nucleus of a spiral vortex, captures the anxiety and disorientation central to the film. His poster for ''[[Anatomy of a Murder]]'' (1959), featuring the silhouette of a corpse jarringly dissected into seven pieces, makes both a pun on the film's title and captures the moral ambiguities within which this court room drama is immersed.\n\nHe created some of his best known posters for films directed by [[Otto Preminger]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Billy Wilder]], and [[Stanley Kubrick]] among others. His last commissioned film poster was created for [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Schindler's List]]'' (1993), but it was never distributed.<ref>Kirkham, Pat & Jennifer Bass (2011) ''Saul Bass: A Life in Film & Design'' (pp. 406 and 420).

Bass has the unusual credit of \"visual consultant\" or \"pictorial consultant\" on five films. For ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960), Bass as \"visual consultant\" designed key elements of the gladiator school and storyboarded the final battle between slaves and Romans. [[John Frankenheimer]], the director of ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' (1966), had Bass storyboard, direct, and edit all but one of the racing sequences for his film. For ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961) Bass filmed the prologue, storyboarded the opening dance sequence, and created the ending title sequence.<ref name=\"kirkham2011\"/>\n\nIt is Bass's credited role as \"pictorial consultant\" for Alfred Hitchcock on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960); however, that has caused some controversy and debate. Bass claimed that he participated in directing the highlight scene of ''Psycho'', the tightly edited shower-murder sequence, though several on set at the time (including star [[Janet Leigh]]) disputed this claim.<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/02/20/psycho_shower_scene_directed_by_saul_bass_watch_storyboards_side_by_side.html/ Harris, Aisha (February 20, 2014) \"Did Saul Bass Direct the Shower Scene in ''Psycho''?\"] Slate.com. Retrieved 2014-2-23</ref>\n\nThe research of several film scholars on Hitchcock's production of ''Psycho'' validates the claim that Bass in his capacity as a graphic artist did indeed have a significant influence on the visual design and pacing of that famous scene. Hitchcock had asked Bass to design and produce storyboards for the shower murder scene and for some other scenes in the film. For this, Bass received a credit as Pictorial Consultant as well as Title Designer. Janet Leigh told [[Donald Spoto]] that \"the planning of the shower scene was left up to Saul Bass, and Hitchcock followed his storyboard precisely. Because of this ... [the shooting] went very professionally,\"<ref>Spoto, Donald (1999 [1983]). ''The Dark Side Of Genius: The Life Of Alfred Hitchcock''. New York: Da Capo Press. (pp. 454\u2013455)</ref> and she told [[Stephen Rebello]] that \"Mr. Hitchcock showed Saul Bass's storyboards to me quite proudly, telling me in exact detail how he was going to shoot the scene from Saul's plans\".<ref>Rebello, Stephen (1990). ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho''. New York: St. Martin's Griffin. (p. 102) {{ISBN|0-312-20785-9}}.</ref>\n\nBill Krohn has noted that Bass's 48 story board panels for the scene introduced all the key aspects of the final shower murder scene \u2013 most notably, the fact that the attacker appears as a silhouette, close-ups of a slashing knife, the shower curtain torn down, a shot of the shower head from below, Marion's desperate outstretched arm, and the famous shot of the transition from the drain hole of the bathtub to Marion Crane's dead eye. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of Bass's iris titles for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.<ref name=Krohn>Krohn, Bill (2003). ''Hitchcock at Work''. (pp. London: Phaidon Press. (p. 231)</ref> Krohn also concludes that Bass did not literally direct the shower scene, proving Hitchcock's presence on the set throughout the shooting of that scene.<ref name=Krohn/>\n\nBass introduced the idea of using a montage of fast cuts and tight framing to render a violent, bloody murder as an impressionistic and nearly bloodless one. Hitchcock felt uncertain about Bass's conception of the scene fearing that audiences might not accept such a stylized and quickly cut sequence. In an interview with film historian [[Pat Kirkham]], Bass recalled, \"Having designed and storyboarded the shower sequence, I showed it to Hitch. He was uneasy about it. It was very un-Hitchcockian in character. He never used that kind of quick cutting; he loved the long shot\".<ref name=\"kirkham2011\"/>\n\nTo convince Hitchcock that the scene would work as planned, eight days before shooting of the final shower scene, Bass used a newsreel camera and Janet Leigh's stand-in [[Marli Renfro]] to shoot footage on the set to plan the shots in more detail. Working with Hitchcock's editor [[George Tomasini]], he edited this footage following the storyboards to show Hitchcock how the scene could work. In the end, Hitchcock gave his approval but, according to Kirkham, made two additions: a spray of blood on the chest of Marion Crane/Janet Leigh as she slides down the tiles, and a close-up of her belly getting stabbed.<ref name=\"kirkham2011\"/>\n\nIn 1964, Saul and his wife and creative partner [[Elaine Bass|Elaine]] directed the short film ''The Searching Eye'' shown during the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], co-produced with [[Sy Wexler]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pyramidmedia.com/homepage/search-by-title/humanities/searching-eye-detail.html|title=HUMANITIES : Searching Eye, The|website=www.pyramidmedia.com}}</ref> The Basses also directed a short documentary film called ''[[Why Man Creates]]''<ref>[https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/55396-Why-Man-Creates Why Man Creates (1968) Theatrical Cartoon - BCDB]</ref> which won the [[Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject]] in 1968.<ref>[http://nightflight.com/why-man-creates-saul-basss-short-film-on-the-nature-of-creativity/ \u201cWhy Man Creates\u201d: Saul Bass\u2019s short film on the nature of creativity\u2014Night Flight]</ref>  An abbreviated version of that film was broadcast on the first episode of the television newsmagazine ''[[60 Minutes]]''.
