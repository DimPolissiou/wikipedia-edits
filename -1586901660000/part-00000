In the derivation of human embryonic stem cell lines, embryos left over from [[in vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) procedures are used. The fact that the blastocyst is destroyed during the process has raised controversy and ethical concerns.\n\nEmbryonic stem cells are [[pluripotent]], meaning they can differentiate to form all cell types in the body.

Adult stem cells are [[multipotent]]: they can generate a limited number of differentiated cell types (unlike pluripotent embryonic stem cells). Types of adult stem cells include [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s and [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s. Hematopoetic stem cells are found in the bone marrow and generate all cells of the immune system all blood cell types. Mesenchymal stem cells are found in umbilical cord blood, amniotic fluid, and adipose tissue and can generate a number of cell types, including [[osteoblast]]s, [[chondrocyte]]s, and [[adipocyte]]s.

The method of generating iPSCs was developed by [[Shinya Yamanaka]]'s lab in 2006; his group demonstrated that the introduction of four specific genes could induce somatic cells to revert to a pluripotent stem cell state.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=Katzutoshi|author2=Shinya Yamanaka |title=Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells from Mouse Embryonic and Adult Fibroblast Cultures by Defined Factors|journal=Cell|date=August 25, 2006|volume=126|issue=4|pages=663\u2013676|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024|pmid=16904174|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nCompared to embryonic stem-cell lines, iPSC lines are also pluripotent in nature but can be derived without the use of human embryos\u2014a process that has raised ethical concerns.

Culture conditions such as the cell [[growth medium]] and surface on which cells are grown vary widely depending on the specific stem cell line. Different biochemical factors can be added to the medium to control the cell phenotype\u2014for example to keep stem cells in a pluripotent state or to differentiate them to a specific cell type.\n\n==Uses==\nStem-cell lines are used in research and regenerative medicine. They can be used to study stem-cell biology and early human development. In the field of regenerative medicine, it has been proposed that stem cells be used in cell-based therapies to replace injured or diseased cells and tissues. Examples of conditions that researchers are working to develop stem-cell-based treatments for include neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and spinal cord injuries.\n\n==Ethical issues==\n{{Main|Stem cell controversy}}\nThere is controversy associated with the derivation and use of human embryonic stem cell lines. This controversy stems from the fact that derivation of human embryonic stem cells requires the destruction of a blastocyst-stage, pre-implantation human embryo. There is a wide range of viewpoints regarding the moral consideration that blastocyst-stage human embryos should be given.<ref>{{cite journal|last=George|first=Robert P|author2=Alfonso Gomez-Lobo |title=The Moral Status of the Human Embryo|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|date=2005|volume=48|issue=2|pages=201\u2013210|doi=10.1353/pbm.2005.0052|pmid=15834193}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Cynthia B|title=Renewing the Stuff of Life: Stem Cells, Ethics, and Public Policy|date=June 25, 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195305241}}</ref>\n\n==Access to human embryonic stem-cell lines==\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, Executive Order 13505 established that federal money can be used for research in which approved human embryonic stem-cell (hESC) lines are used, but it cannot be used to derive new lines.<ref>{{cite web|title=Executive Order: Removing barriers to responsible scientific research involving human stem cells|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Removing-Barriers-to-Responsible-Scientific-Research-Involving-Human-Stem-Cells|publisher=The White House|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418013637/http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Removing-Barriers-to-Responsible-Scientific-Research-Involving-Human-Stem-Cells/|archive-date=2014-04-18|df=}}</ref> The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines on Human Stem Cell Research, effective July 7, 2009, implemented the Executive Order 13505 by establishing criteria which hESC lines must meet to be approved for funding.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Institutes of Health Guidelines on Human Stem Cell Research|url=http://stemcells.nih.gov/policy/pages/2009guidelines.aspx|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> The NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry can be accessed online and has updated information on cell lines eligible for NIH funding.<ref>{{cite web|title=NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry|url=https://grants.nih.gov/stem_cells/registry/current.htm|accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref>  There are 378 approved lines as of March 2017.\n\nStudies have found that approved hESC lines are not uniformly used in the US data from cell banks and surveys of researchers indicate that only a handful of the available hESC lines are routinely used in research.

Culture conditions such as the cell [[growth medium]] and surface on which cells are grown vary widely depending on the specific stem cell line. Different biochemical factors can be added to the medium to control the cell phenotype\u2014for example to keep stem cells in a pluripotent state or to differentiate them to a specific cell type.\n\n==Uses==\nStem-cell lines are used in research and regenerative medicine. They can be used to study stem-cell biology and early human development. In the field of regenerative medicine, it has been proposed that stem cells be used in cell-based therapies to replace injured or diseased cells and tissues. Examples of conditions that researchers are working to develop stem-cell-based treatments for include neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and spinal cord injuries.\n\n==Ethical issues==\n{{Main|Stem cell controversy}}\nThere is controversy associated with the derivation and use of human embryonic stem cell lines. This controversy stems from the fact that derivation of human embryonic stem cells requires the destruction of a blastocyst-stage, pre-implantation human embryo.

On February 27, 2019, the Monster (rapper [[T-Pain]]) was declared the winner, and the Peacock (singer [[Donny Osmond]]) the runner-up.\n\nTwelve celebrities compete anonymously in newly created full-bodied costumes including distinctive masks. Before each performance a video package teases clues to their identity with the celebrity narrating aspects of their biography in a disguised voice. After each performs in their own voice, the panel attempts to guess who is the masked singer. The contestants are later voted on to see who is safe and continues, or is up for a further round of singing in that episode, and possibly elimination.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Masked Singer US Lion.jpg|thumb||upright=0.8|left|As with every costume, the Lion began as a sketch by Toybina.

On February 27, 2019, the Monster (rapper [[T-Pain]]) was declared the winner, and the Peacock (singer [[Donny Osmond]]) the runner-up.\n\nTwelve celebrities compete anonymously in newly created full-bodied costumes including distinctive masks. Before each performance a video package teases clues to their identity with the celebrity narrating aspects of their biography in a disguised voice. After each performs in their own voice, the panel attempts to guess who is the masked singer. The contestants are later voted on to see who is safe and continues, or is up for a further round of singing in that episode, and possibly elimination.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Masked Singer US Lion.jpg|thumb||upright=0.8|left|As with every costume, the Lion began as a sketch by Toybina.

However, during filming, the large eye the celebrity saw out of frequently fogged up due to a lack of air; tiny [[Fan (machine)|fans]] were then installed inside the costume to provide circulation.<ref name=\"E!
