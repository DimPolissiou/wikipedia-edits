{"title_page": "Overhang seat", "text_new": "{{No footnotes|date=July 2018}}\n\n'''Overhang seats''' can arise in elections under the traditional (i.e. as it originated in [[Germany]]) [[mixed-member proportional representation|mixed member proportional]] (MMP) system, when a party's share of the nationwide party votes entitles it to fewer seats than the number of [[electoral district|constituencies]] it won.\n\n== How overhang seats arise ==\nUnder MMP, a party is entitled to a number of seats based on its share of the total vote. If a party's share entitles it to ten seats and its candidates win seven constituencies, it will be awarded three list seats, bringing it up to its required number. This only works, however, if the party's seat entitlement is not less than the number of constituencies it has won. If, for example, a party is entitled to five seats, but wins six constituencies, the sixth constituency seat is referred to as an overhang seat.\n\n== Two mechanisms to earn many overhang seats ==\nThe two mechanisms that together increase the number of overhang seats are:\n# winning many constituencies;\n# decreasing the number of party votes and therefore the number of seats to which the party is proportionally entitled.\n\nIn many countries, overhang seats are rare &ndash; a party that is able to win constituency seats is generally able to win a significant portion of the party vote as well. There are, however, some circumstances in which overhang seats may arise relatively easily:\n\n*'''Few major parties, large number of minor parties''' &ndash; When there are only one or two major parties, but a relatively large number of minor parties that, combined, achieve a significant share of the total proportional vote, but fail to elect any constituency seats, the large parties often end up with overhang seats.\n*''' Similar lead across constituencies''' &ndash; If one party wins all or most constituencies of a relevant area with a rather low margin, it would be more prone to overhang mandates than if different parties lead in different constituencies, with the same overall share of each of the parties. As such, if there is less difference between constituencies, overhang seats are more probable.\n*'''A large number of constituencies compared with the total number of seats''' &ndash; If too many seats are used for constituencies, the remainder are less likely to ensure strict proportionality.\n*'''Unevenly sized constituencies''' &ndash; Candidates that win small constituencies by a narrow margin do not generate enough votes to justify their full seats under a proportional system.\n*'''Low turnout in some constituencies''' &ndash; This has the same effect as small constituencies. Furthermore, turnout and party preferences may be highly correlated, e.g. rural vs. urban areas.\n*'''Small number of seats to be allocated''' &ndash; The higher the absolute number of constituencies, the more likely it is that different reasons for overhang seats will balance out between parties. E.g., after the German federal Bundestag election in 2013, the main reason for overhang seats was that some compensation happens for party's state lists instead of at the federal level only.\n*'''Individual candidates with strong local followings''' &ndash; Sometimes, a particular politician will have strong support in their own constituency, but will belong to a party with very low support, even in their own area. The candidate will be elected based on their own qualities, but the party they belong to will not receive enough votes to justify the candidate's seat. In the case of independent candidates, this is usually guaranteed &ndash; they have no party at all, and so obviously cannot win votes under MMP's party-list proportional representation. However, some countries, such as [[Electoral system of New Zealand|New Zealand]], have special rules dealing with independents &ndash; seats won by these candidates are exempted from the proportional system altogether.\n*'''Regional parties''' &ndash; Parties based in a particular region may win a substantial number of constituency seats in that region without necessarily gaining a large share of the national vote. Parties focused on particular ethnic or religions minorities may also come under this category, particularly if seats are [[Reserved political positions|reserved]] for these groups.\n*'''Tactical voting''' &ndash; Voters in countries such as [[Germany]] may cast two votes and they need not be for the same party.  A voter might support one party in the list vote but vote for the candidate of another party in the local vote, perhaps because the former party lacks a candidate in his or her constituency or it has a candidate but he or she has little chance of winning.  Parties that win many local seats but attract a reduced list vote may receive an overhang as a result.\n*'''[[Decoy parties]]''' &ndash; Party labels in the constituencies can be deliberately mismatched with those in the proportional vote in an attempt to induce [[tactical voting]].  In Italy in 2001, two lists won a significant majority of the total number of first-past-the post seats, despite winning almost none of the proportional vote. The system, nicknamed [[scorporo]], was not a type of additional member system in which overhangs could occur, it resulted in a significant distortion to the desired compensatory nature.\n\n==Dealing with overhang seats==\nOverhang seats are dealt with in different ways by different systems. The four main methods are:\n\n: 1. '''Allow the overhang''' &ndash; A party is allowed to keep any overhang seats it wins, but other parties are still awarded the same number of seats that they are entitled to. This means that a party with overhang seats has more seats than its entitlement. \n:: '''1A.''' The [[New Zealand Parliament]] uses this system; one extra seat was added in the [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005 election]] and [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011 election]], and two extra seats in the [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008 election]]. This system was also used in the [[Bundestag|German Bundestag]] until 2013, when Germany switched to a fully compensatory system (see option 3 below).\n:: '''1B.''' Other parties may be given additional list seats (sometimes called \"balance seats\" or [[leveling seat]]s) in order that they are not disadvantaged. This preserves the same ratio between parties as was established in the election. It also increases the size of the legislature, as overhang seats are added, and there may also be extra list seats added to counteract them. This system results is less proportional than full compensation, as the party with the overhang is still receiving a \"bonus\" above its proportional entitlement. The number of extra seats that may be created is sometimes limited to avoid an excessive increase in the size of the assembly, which approaches the second option, below.  \n: 2. '''Take the number of additional list seats off from the other parties' proportional entitlement''' &ndash; A party is allowed to keep any overhang seats it wins, and the corresponding number of list seats allocated to other parties is eliminated to maintain the number of assembly seats. This means that a party with overhang seats has more seats than its entitlement, and other parties have fewer. This approach is used in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Bolivia]] and the [[National Assembly of Lesotho]]. It was unsuccessfully recommended by the 2006 [[Ontario Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform]] for adoption by the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]], and the proposed [[Dual-member proportional representation]] system uses this approach as well. While for the first additional list seats are simply denied to parties, in the latter three cases{{specify}}, a fairer procedure was proposed of subtracting the constituency seats won by parties with overhang seats from the total number of seats and recalculating the quota (the [[largest remainder method]] was also recommended) to proportionally redistribute the list seats to the other parties. \n: 3. '''Non-awarding of overhang seats''' &ndash; A party is ''not'' allowed to keep any overhang seats it wins, with its number of seats actually being reduced until it fits the party's entitlement. This method raises the question of ''which'' constituency seats the party is not allowed to keep.  After that is determined, it would then have to be decided who, if any, will represent these constituencies.\n: 4. '''Fully compensatory''' &ndash; Similar to Option 1. However, in this model other non-overhang parties will be compensated by receiving additional seats above their initial allocation to ensure full proportionality for all parties including the party with overhang seats which after additional list seats are created no longer has more of the total of assembly seats than it is proportionally entitled to. These bonus seats therefore serve to offset the \"overhang bonus\" described in Option 1. After the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled in 2008 that the established implementation of Option 1 was unconstitutional (because in rare instances, it allowed votes to negatively affect the number of seats for a given party, contradicting the voter's will), full compensation of overhang seats is applied as of 2013 in the German Bundestag by providing for the first time for the creation of national leveling seats.\n\n== Examples == \nIn [[New Zealand]], the [[M\u0101ori Party]] won one overhang seat in [[2005 New Zealand general election|2005]] and [[2011 New Zealand general election|2011]], and two overhang seats in [[2008 New Zealand general election|2008]]. In 2005 their share of the party vote was under 2% on the initial election night count, but was 2.12% in the final count which included special votes cast outside the electorate. On election night it appeared that the party, whose candidates had won four electorate seats, would get two overhang seats in Parliament. However with their party vote above 2% the party got an extra seat and hence needed only one overhang seat. National got one less list seat in the final count, so then conceded defeat (the result was close between the two largest parties, [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]).\n\nIn [[Germany]], the electoral system requires that a party needs 5% of the popular vote to win any seats in state and federal elections, while every overhang seat is granted. Unless a party wins more than three district seats, it is completely excluded from the election threshold. This happened in [[1994 German federal election|1994]] and [[2002 German federal election|2002]] to [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|PDS]], which they failed to reach 5% of party-list votes.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary|Overhang}}\n* [[Underhang seat]]\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite web|url=http://www.wahlrecht.de/english/overhang.html|title=Overhang seats|website=Wahlrecht.de|date=26 July 2003|language=en}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Politics}}\n{{Voting systems}}\n\n[[Category:Party-list proportional representation]]\n[[Category:Elections in Germany]]\n\n[[sco:Addeetional Member Seestem#Owerhang saets]]\n", "text_old": "{{No footnotes|date=July 2018}}\n\n'''Overhang seats''' can arise in elections under the traditional (i.e. as it originated in [[Germany]]) [[mixed-member proportional representation|mixed member proportional]] (MMP) system, when a party's share of the nationwide party votes entitles it to fewer seats than the number of [[electoral district|constituencies]] it won.\n\n== How overhang seats arise ==\nUnder MMP, a party is entitled to a number of seats based on its share of the total vote.

As the eldest child, she takes on a heavier burden, taking care of her younger sisters and assisting her father with bee keeping. One day as the family is playing on the beach after a long day, they are told to quit making so much noise and discover that a short distance away a TV show is being filmed.  They watch the show being filmed and, as, they are about to leave, the star of the show, Milly, calls them over and gives Gelsomina a hair clip to keep.\n\nWatching the program they were filming on TV, Gelsomina learns that the program is launching a competition called Countryside Wonders, in which seven farmers will compete to have their products featured on the show. While her father, Wolfgang, is violently against the family competing, her mother warms to the idea, despite the fact that the standards of their honey production are not up to par. \n\nMeanwhile, Wolfgang hires a juvenile delinquent named Martin to work on the farm, thinking that he will be able to help with the honey production. Martin never talks. Though Wolfgang tries to favor Martin, he eventually discovers that he is an ineffectual worker. \n\nUnbeknownst to her father, Gelsomina fills out an application for her family to compete in Countryside Wonders. She forgets about the application after an old friend of her father comes to stay in the house. Later, left alone by their parents, while switching out the honeycombs to put in the processor, she accidentally injures her younger sister, Marinella. At the hospital, while Marinella is being stitched up, Gelsomina realizes that, before they left, Martin forgot to change the bucket which collects the processed honey and, on returning home, they find honey spilled over the floor. At the same time, they are visited by a man from Countryside Wonders who is there to see if their production room is up to par. The children manage to clean the work area and they are allowed to compete. However, Wolfgang is infuriated by the news.\n\nNevertheless, the family goes to compete on the show, where they are dressed up in ridiculous garb and each contestant must plead their case in front of the judges. On TV, Wolfgang freezes and is unable to explain what makes his honey so special. However, Gelsomina steps up and, with Martin, performs a trick in which he whistles and bees crawl out of her mouth onto her face. The family loses the competition, however. Martin runs away and Gelsomina follows him but is unable to find him. On the last boat ride back from the island, she finds herself alone with Milly, who takes off her wig and gives Gelsomina a hairpin. Gelsomina swims back to the island and finds Martin, but she returns to her family without him. Because they lost the competition and have no money, the family is forced to leave the farm. Before they go, they discuss leaving something behind under the floorboards in secret for someone else to discover later.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alba Rohrwacher]]\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Hennicke]]\n* [[Monica Bellucci]]\n* [[Sabine Timoteo]]\n* [[Sam Louwyck]] as Wolfgang\n* Alexandra Maria Lungu\n* Margarete Tiesel\n* Agnese Graziani\n* Eva Lea Pace Morrow\n* Maris Stella Morrow\n* Luis Huilca Logrono\n\n==Production==\nDirector [[Alice Rohrwacher]] based the movie on her memories of her childhood working for her parents, who were beekeepers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coppola|first1=Sofia|title=Sofia Coppola Interviews the Sisters Behind Her Favorite New Film|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/17/t-magazine/alice-alba-rohrwacher.html|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> Rohrwacher stated that some parts of the film were filmed illegally, particularly the parts with the bees which they were not supposed to film for insurance purposes and which she filmed anyway on a national holiday when no one was around to stop her.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lucca|first1=Violet|title=Interview: Alice Rohrwacher|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/blog/interview-alice-rohrwacher/|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''The Wonders'' premiered at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]] to positive reviews.

Later, left alone by their parents, while switching out the honeycombs to put in the processor, she accidentally injures her younger sister, Marinella. At the hospital, while Marinella is being stitched up, Gelsomina realizes that, before they left, Martin forgot to change the bucket which collects the processed honey and, on returning home, they find honey spilled over the floor. At the same time, they are visited by a man from Countryside Wonders who is there to see if their production room is up to par. The children manage to clean the work area and they are allowed to compete. However, Wolfgang is infuriated by the news.\n\nNevertheless, the family goes to compete on the show, where they are dressed up in ridiculous garb and each contestant must plead their case in front of the judges. On TV, Wolfgang freezes and is unable to explain what makes his honey so special. However, Gelsomina steps up and, with Martin, performs a trick in which he whistles and bees crawl out of her mouth onto her face. The family loses the competition, however. Martin runs away and Gelsomina follows him but is unable to find him. On the last boat ride back from the island, she finds herself alone with Milly, who takes off her wig and gives Gelsomina a hairpin. Gelsomina swims back to the island and finds Martin, but she returns to her family without him. Because they lost the competition and have no money, the family is forced to leave the farm. Before they go, they discuss leaving something behind under the floorboards in secret for someone else to discover later.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Alba Rohrwacher]]\n* [[Andr\u00e9 Hennicke]]\n* [[Monica Bellucci]]\n* [[Sabine Timoteo]]\n* [[Sam Louwyck]] as Wolfgang\n* Alexandra Maria Lungu\n* Margarete Tiesel\n* Agnese Graziani\n* Eva Lea Pace Morrow\n* Maris Stella Morrow\n* Luis Huilca Logrono\n\n==Production==\nDirector [[Alice Rohrwacher]] based the movie on her memories of her childhood working for her parents, who were beekeepers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coppola|first1=Sofia|title=Sofia Coppola Interviews the Sisters Behind Her Favorite New Film|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/17/t-magazine/alice-alba-rohrwacher.html|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> Rohrwacher stated that some parts of the film were filmed illegally, particularly the parts with the bees which they were not supposed to film for insurance purposes and which she filmed anyway on a national holiday when no one was around to stop her.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lucca|first1=Violet|title=Interview: Alice Rohrwacher|url=http://www.filmcomment.com/blog/interview-alice-rohrwacher/|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''The Wonders'' premiered at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]] to positive reviews.

Written in the first inversion of the A{{music|flat}} major chord, it is a [[Neapolitan chord]] that implies a majestic aura, ending in a dissonant, questioning left-hand chord D, G, and E{{music|flat}} that is not resolved until later on in the piece. Though Chopin's original manuscript clearly marks an E{{music|flat}} as the top note, the chord has caused some degree of controversy, and thus, some versions of the work \u2013 such as the [[Karl Klindworth|Klindworth]] edition \u2013 include D, G, D as an [[ossia]].<ref name=\"Huneker\" /> The main section of the ''Ballade'' is built from two main themes. The brief introduction fades into the first theme, introduced at measure 8. After some elaboration, the second theme is introduced softly at measure 68. This theme is also elaborated on. Both themes then return in different keys, and the first theme finally returns again in the same key, albeit with an altered left hand accompaniment. A thundering chord introduces the [[Coda (music)|coda]], marked ''Presto con fuoco'', to which the initial Neapolitan harmony re-emerges in constant dynamic forward propulsion, which eventually ends the piece in a fiery double octave scale run down the keyboard. As a whole, the piece is structurally complex and not strictly confined to any particular form, but incorporates ideas from mainly the [[sonata form|sonata]] and [[variation (music)|variation]] forms.\n\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Frederic Chopin - ballade no. 1 in g minor, op. 23.ogg|title=Ballade No. 1|description=Performed by Donald Betts.

While the other three are written in strict compound duple [[Meter (music)|time]] with a {{music|time|6|8}} time signature, ''Ballade'' No. 1 bears deviations from this. The introduction is written in {{music|time|4|4}} time, and the more extensive ''Presto con fuoco'' coda is written in {{music|time|2|2}} or {{music|time|4|4}}.

[[Robert Schumann]], who had dedicated his ''[[Kreisleriana]]'', Op. 16, to Chopin, received the dedication of this ''Ballade'' in return. The piece has been criticized by some prominent pianists and [[Musicology|musicologists]], including its dedicatee Schumann, as a less ingenious work than the first.<ref name=\"Huneker\" /> There is some degree of disagreement as to its inspiration, with the claim, often made that it was inspired by [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s poem ''\u015awitezianka'', the lake of Willis, but this claim is unsubstantiated, and the ''Ballade'' No. 3 is sometimes attributed to this poem as well.<ref name=\"ourchopin\" /><ref name=\"Huneker\" />\n\nAs with the ''Ballades'' No. 3 and No. 4, the ''Ballade'' No. 2 is written in compound duple ({{music|time|6|8}}) time. It opens quietly on the [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] of the F major key, with repeated Cs in both the left and right hands. This quickly progresses to a melody and development with the performance instruction ''[[Sotto voce (music)|sotto voce]]'' \u2013 literally \"under the voice\", or \"quietly\". This section fades out with several repeated As in the right hand. The next section of the ballade, in stark contrast to the first, opens with the performance instruction ''Presto con fuoco'' \u2013 literally \"very fast with fire\". It is in an unusual key for a secondary melody; instead of being in the [[parallel minor]] of F minor, it is instead in A minor. Chopin scholar and biographer [[Frederick Niecks]] writes of it, \"The entrance of the presto ... seems out of keeping with what precedes, but what we hear after... justifies the presence of the presto.\"<ref name=\"Niecks\">{{cite book|title=Frederick Chopin as a Man and Musician|url=https://archive.org/details/frederickchopina02niec|last=Niecks|first=Frederick|authorlink=Frederick Niecks|publisher=Novello|year=1888}}</ref> The piece shortly returns to its original tempo and style, and the first melody is further elaborated. Here, Chopin incorporates variations on the melody not present in the initial expository stage of the piece. This development progresses until the ''Presto con fuoco'' theme is naturally reintroduced and recapitulated. This time, it is elaborated on as well, and ends abruptly, until the theme is echoed once more and the piece fades out. The original F major theme is echoed, but now in A minor, the key of the ''Presto''; it is thus that the piece ends, without returning to its [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] key.<ref name=\"Nicholas\">{{cite book |title=Chopin: His Life and Music |last=Nicholas |first=Jeremy |year=2007 |publisher=Sourcebooks MediaFusion |location=Naperville, Illinois |isbn=1-4022-0757-3 |pages=268}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ballade No. 3==\n'''Ballade No. 3 in A{{music|flat}} major, Op. 47''', dating from 1841, is dedicated to Pauline de Noailles.<ref name=\"ourchopin\" /> The inspiration for this ''Ballade'' is usually claimed to be [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s poem ''Undine'',<ref name=\"Huneker\" /> also known as ''\u015awitezianka''.<ref name=\"ourchopin\" /> There are structural similarities with the \"[[Prelude Op. 28, No. 15|Raindrop Prelude]]\" which was inspired by the weather in Majorca during Chopin's disastrous vacation with [[George Sand]].

The first A theme is in two parts; the first part is song-like and the second is dance-like. Out of the four ballades, the third ''Ballade'' has the tightest structure. This ''Ballade'' also uses development procedures that are successful at heightening the tension.<ref>Steward Gordon. ''A History of Keyboard Literature''. (California: Schirmer, 1996), 291\u2013292.</ref>\n\nThe ''Ballade'' opens with a lengthy introduction marked ''dolce'' (sweet). The introduction is [[Theme (music)|thematically]] unrelated to a majority of the piece but is repeated at the close and climax of the work. Following the introduction, Chopin introduces a new theme in a section with the performance direction ''mezza voce''; this theme consists of repeated Cs in two broken octaves in the right hand. This theme reoccurs three different times in the ballade, twice on C and once on A{{music|flat}}. The \"mezza voce\" section soon develops into a furious F minor chordal section and once again returns to A{{music|flat}}. The 'mezza voce' section is repeated, following by a new theme consisting of right hand sixteenth-note leggiero runs. The following return of the broken octave theme is [[Transposition (music)|transposed]] from C to A{{music|flat}} (the repeated C's now being A{{music|flat}}'s). The key signature then shifts to C{{music|sharp}} minor. The original \"B\" theme is then developed, this time using rapid, chromatic left-hand runs in the left hand under large chords in the right. This theme builds to a climax through rapid repetition of broken G{{music|sharp}} octaves (referencing the \"mezza voce\" theme) with fragments of the \"B\" theme in the left hand. A retransition occurs as the dynamic builds from piano to forte. The figuration in the left hand is chromatic and consists of spans frequently larger than an octave. The key signature then shifts back to A{{music|flat}} major. In the final section of the arch, the \"A\" theme from the introduction is repeated again in octaves. The ballade ends with a reprise of the A{{music|flat}} leggiero runs and a second right hand arpeggio. Four chords provide closure to the piece.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ballade No. 4==\n[[File:Ballade 4 Chopin.png|400px|thumb|Opening bars of Ballade No. 4]]\n'''Ballade No. 4 in F minor, Op. 52''', was composed in 1842 in Paris and [[Nohant-Vic|Nohant]] and revised in 1843. The work was dedicated to [[Charlotte de Rothschild|Baroness Rothschild]], wife of Nathaniel de Rothschild,<ref name=\"Huneker\" /> who had invited Chopin to play in her Parisian residence, where she introduced him to the aristocracy and nobility. In the preface to his edition of Chopin's ballades, [[Alfred Cortot]] claims that the inspiration for this ''Ballade'' is [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s poem ''The Three Budrys'', which tells of three brothers sent away by their father to seek treasures, and the story of their return with three Polish brides.<ref>Foreword, ''The Ballads of Chopin'', Salabert Editions. An English version of the poem can be found [http://daisy.htmlplanet.com/budrys.html here [dead link] ]</ref>\n\nA phrase in the dominant major (marked ''piano'') opens the seven introductory measures and leads into the first subject of sonata-form exposition, a melody with [[Slavs|Slavonic]] coloration. The first theme undergoes four cumulative transformations with decorations, [[Counter-melody|counter-melodies]], [[counterpoint]], and a [[nocturne]]-like [[fioritura]].<ref>Chopin: Profile of his Music: Extended Forms: Ballades, Scherzos and Fantasies {{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}</ref> The development of the second theme and its intertwining with the first heightens the complexity of the musical structure and builds tension. Through the intertwining and thus the simultaneous development of the two themes, Chopin effectively combines the use of both the [[sonata form]] and the [[Variation (music)|variation form]].<ref name=\"howto\" /> The body of the piece concludes with a series of accented ''fortissimo'' chords, followed by a momentary calm of five ''pianissimo'' chords. This then suddenly leads into an extremely fast, turbulent [[coda (music)|coda]], written in exuberant [[counterpoint]]. Structurally ''Ballade'' No. 4 is decidedly intricate.<ref name=\"ourchopin\" /><ref name=\"Huneker\" />\n{{listen|type=music\n | filename     = Chopin, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric - Ballade no. 4 in f minor, op. 52.ogg\n | title        = Ballade No. 4\n | description  = Performed by Donald Betts; courtesy of Musopen\n | filename2    = Chopin Ballade 4 Fmin.ogg\n | title2       = Ballade No. 4\n | description2 = Performed by [[Randolph Hokanson]]\n}}\nA distinguishing feature of the fourth ''Ballade'' is its contrapuntal nature. [[Counterpoint]] is found only sporadically in ''Ballades'' Nos. 1 and 2. The fourth ''Ballade'' is musically more subtle than the other three, as most of its portions remain melancholic and profound.

Written in the first inversion of the A{{music|flat}} major chord, it is a [[Neapolitan chord]] that implies a majestic aura, ending in a dissonant, questioning left-hand chord D, G, and E{{music|flat}} that is not resolved until later on in the piece. Though Chopin's original manuscript clearly marks an E{{music|flat}} as the top note, the chord has caused some degree of controversy, and thus, some versions of the work \u2013 such as the [[Karl Klindworth|Klindworth]] edition \u2013 include D, G, D as an [[ossia]].<ref name=\"Huneker\" /> The main section of the ''Ballade'' is built from two main themes. The brief introduction fades into the first theme, introduced at measure 8. After some elaboration, the second theme is introduced softly at measure 68. This theme is also elaborated on. Both themes then return in different keys, and the first theme finally returns again in the same key, albeit with an altered left hand accompaniment. A thundering chord introduces the [[Coda (music)|coda]], marked ''Presto con fuoco'', to which the initial Neapolitan harmony re-emerges in constant dynamic forward propulsion, which eventually ends the piece in a fiery double octave scale run down the keyboard. As a whole, the piece is structurally complex and not strictly confined to any particular form, but incorporates ideas from mainly the [[sonata form|sonata]] and [[variation (music)|variation]] forms.\n\n{{listen|type=music|filename=Frederic Chopin - ballade no. 1 in g minor, op. 23.ogg|title=Ballade No. 1|description=Performed by Donald Betts.

While the other three are written in strict compound duple [[Meter (music)|time]] with a {{music|time|6|8}} time signature, ''Ballade'' No. 1 bears deviations from this. The introduction is written in {{music|time|4|4}} time, and the more extensive ''Presto con fuoco'' coda is written in {{music|time|2|2}} or {{music|time|4|4}}.

[[Robert Schumann]], who had dedicated his ''[[Kreisleriana]]'', Op. 16, to Chopin, received the dedication of this ''Ballade'' in return. The piece has been criticized by some prominent pianists and [[Musicology|musicologists]], including its dedicatee Schumann, as a less ingenious work than the first.<ref name=\"Huneker\" /> There is some degree of disagreement as to its inspiration, with the claim, often made that it was inspired by [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s poem ''\u015awitezianka'', the lake of Willis, but this claim is unsubstantiated, and the ''Ballade'' No. 3 is sometimes attributed to this poem as well.<ref name=\"ourchopin\" /><ref name=\"Huneker\" />\n\nAs with the ''Ballades'' No. 3 and No. 4, the ''Ballade'' No. 2 is written in compound duple ({{music|time|6|8}}) time. It opens quietly on the [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] of the F major key, with repeated Cs in both the left and right hands. This quickly progresses to a melody and development with the performance instruction ''[[Sotto voce (music)|sotto voce]]'' \u2013 literally \"under the voice\", or \"quietly\". This section fades out with several repeated As in the right hand. The next section of the ballade, in stark contrast to the first, opens with the performance instruction ''Presto con fuoco'' \u2013 literally \"very fast with fire\". It is in an unusual key for a secondary melody; instead of being in the [[parallel minor]] of F minor, it is instead in A minor. Chopin scholar and biographer [[Frederick Niecks]] writes of it, \"The entrance of the presto ... seems out of keeping with what precedes, but what we hear after... justifies the presence of the presto.\"<ref name=\"Niecks\">{{cite book|title=Frederick Chopin as a Man and Musician|url=https://archive.org/details/frederickchopina02niec|last=Niecks|first=Frederick|authorlink=Frederick Niecks|publisher=Novello|year=1888}}</ref> The piece shortly returns to its original tempo and style, and the first melody is further elaborated. Here, Chopin incorporates variations on the melody not present in the initial expository stage of the piece. This development progresses until the ''Presto con fuoco'' theme is naturally reintroduced and recapitulated. This time, it is elaborated on as well, and ends abruptly, until the theme is echoed once more and the piece fades out. The original F major theme is echoed, but now in A minor, the key of the ''Presto''; it is thus that the piece ends, without returning to its [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] key.<ref name=\"Nicholas\">{{cite book |title=Chopin: His Life and Music |last=Nicholas |first=Jeremy |year=2007 |publisher=Sourcebooks MediaFusion |location=Naperville, Illinois |isbn=1-4022-0757-3 |pages=268}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ballade No. 3==\n'''Ballade No. 3 in A{{music|flat}} major, Op. 47''', dating from 1841, is dedicated to Pauline de Noailles.<ref name=\"ourchopin\" /> The inspiration for this ''Ballade'' is usually claimed to be [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s poem ''Undine'',<ref name=\"Huneker\" /> also known as ''\u015awitezianka''.<ref name=\"ourchopin\" /> There are structural similarities with the \"[[Prelude Op. 28, No. 15|Raindrop Prelude]]\" which was inspired by the weather in Majorca during Chopin's disastrous vacation with [[George Sand]].

The first A theme is in two parts; the first part is song-like and the second is dance-like. Out of the four ballades, the third ''Ballade'' has the tightest structure. This ''Ballade'' also uses development procedures that are successful at heightening the tension.<ref>Steward Gordon. ''A History of Keyboard Literature''. (California: Schirmer, 1996), 291\u2013292.</ref>\n\nThe ''Ballade'' opens with a lengthy introduction marked ''dolce'' (sweet). The introduction is [[Theme (music)|thematically]] unrelated to a majority of the piece but is repeated at the close and climax of the work. Following the introduction, Chopin introduces a new theme in a section with the performance direction ''mezza voce''; this theme consists of repeated Cs in two broken octaves in the right hand. This theme reoccurs three different times in the ballade, twice on C and once on A{{music|flat}}. The \"mezza voce\" section soon develops into a furious F minor chordal section and once again returns to A{{music|flat}}. The 'mezza voce' section is repeated, following by a new theme consisting of right hand sixteenth-note leggiero runs. The following return of the broken octave theme is [[Transposition (music)|transposed]] from C to A{{music|flat}} (the repeated C's now being A{{music|flat}}'s). The key signature then shifts to C{{music|sharp}} minor. The original \"B\" theme is then developed, this time using rapid, chromatic left-hand runs in the left hand under large chords in the right. This theme builds to a climax through rapid repetition of broken G{{music|sharp}} octaves (referencing the \"mezza voce\" theme) with fragments of the \"B\" theme in the left hand. A retransition occurs as the dynamic builds from piano to forte. The figuration in the left hand is chromatic and consists of spans frequently larger than an octave. The key signature then shifts back to A{{music|flat}} major. In the final section of the arch, the \"A\" theme from the introduction is repeated again in octaves. The ballade ends with a reprise of the A{{music|flat}} leggiero runs and a second right hand arpeggio. Four chords provide closure to the piece.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Ballade No. 4==\n[[File:Ballade 4 Chopin.png|400px|thumb|Opening bars of Ballade No. 4]]\n'''Ballade No. 4 in F minor, Op. 52''', was composed in 1842 in Paris and [[Nohant-Vic|Nohant]] and revised in 1843. The work was dedicated to [[Charlotte de Rothschild|Baroness Rothschild]], wife of Nathaniel de Rothschild,<ref name=\"Huneker\" /> who had invited Chopin to play in her Parisian residence, where she introduced him to the aristocracy and nobility. In the preface to his edition of Chopin's ballades, [[Alfred Cortot]] claims that the inspiration for this ''Ballade'' is [[Adam Mickiewicz]]'s poem ''The Three Budrys'', which tells of three brothers sent away by their father to seek treasures, and the story of their return with three Polish brides.<ref>Foreword, ''The Ballads of Chopin'', Salabert Editions. An English version of the poem can be found [http://daisy.htmlplanet.com/budrys.html here [dead link] ]</ref>\n\nA phrase in the dominant major (marked ''piano'') opens the seven introductory measures and leads into the first subject of sonata-form exposition, a melody with [[Slavs|Slavonic]] coloration. The first theme undergoes four cumulative transformations with decorations, [[Counter-melody|counter-melodies]], [[counterpoint]], and a [[nocturne]]-like [[fioritura]].<ref>Chopin: Profile of his Music: Extended Forms: Ballades, Scherzos and Fantasies {{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}</ref> The development of the second theme and its intertwining with the first heightens the complexity of the musical structure and builds tension. Through the intertwining and thus the simultaneous development of the two themes, Chopin effectively combines the use of both the [[sonata form]] and the [[Variation (music)|variation form]].<ref name=\"howto\" /> The body of the piece concludes with a series of accented ''fortissimo'' chords, followed by a momentary calm of five ''pianissimo'' chords. This then suddenly leads into an extremely fast, turbulent [[coda (music)|coda]], written in exuberant [[counterpoint]]. Structurally ''Ballade'' No. 4 is decidedly intricate.<ref name=\"ourchopin\" /><ref name=\"Huneker\" />\n{{listen|type=music\n | filename     = Chopin, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric - Ballade no. 4 in f minor, op. 52.ogg\n | title        = Ballade No. 4\n | description  = Performed by Donald Betts; courtesy of Musopen\n | filename2    = Chopin Ballade 4 Fmin.ogg\n | title2       = Ballade No. 4\n | description2 = Performed by [[Randolph Hokanson]]\n}}\nA distinguishing feature of the fourth ''Ballade'' is its contrapuntal nature. [[Counterpoint]] is found only sporadically in ''Ballades'' Nos. 1 and 2. The fourth ''Ballade'' is musically more subtle than the other three, as most of its portions remain melancholic and profound.

All three lawyers were originally court-appointed, but after the initial hearings Sayenko requested to be represented by his father, because his appointed lawyer apparently graduated from law school only two months earlier.<ref name=\"kiev1\"/> The request was granted, which significantly delayed the proceedings as Sayenko's father familiarized himself with the evidence. Igor Sayenko became the most prominent figure on the defense, giving numerous interviews and taking a lead role in court proceedings.\n\nHanzha's attorneys based their defense on the fact that he never participated in the murder spree, and was involved only with a single incident four months before the killings began, in which two men were robbed in the nearby town of [[Kamianske|Dniprodzerzhynsk]]. Hanzha admitted his guilt, hoping for leniency in sentencing.<ref name=\"poleznaya\"/>\n \nThe defense strategy for the other two suspects was to attack the prosecution on a wide front. Multiple investigators were called to the stand, including the leader of the arrest team and the lead investigator in the case. The defense claimed illegal searches, improperly kept records, and problems during questioning. Igor Sayenko raised questions about the videotape of the searches conducted in the suspects' apartments. According to Sayenko, the tape constantly stops and restarts, showing the evidence obtained only after being picked up by investigators, but never the actual moment of discovery.<ref name=\"kiev1\"/> The legal team also denied that the people in the murder videos were the suspects.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', Igor Sayenko claimed that a fourth suspect named Danila Kozlov was initially charged with the murders.<ref name=\"kiev1\"/> Tatiana Shram, a sister of victim Elena Shram, also stated in an interview that she saw Kozlov's name mentioned in court documents, and that Kozlov was reportedly aware of the murders, and was with the suspects just before her sister was murdered. Shram further stated that the investigators told her that Kozlov remains free because he \"did not murder anyone,\" and that when her attorney attempted to bring up the matter in court, the judge \"asked him to sit down.\"<ref name=\"credit\">{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=12946|title=Justice on credit: The case of the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs |publisher=Dnepropetrovsk City News|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIgor Sayenko continued to speculate on the influence of the families of the \"real killers\", claiming that he conducted an interview with an escaped victim who wanted his identity kept secret for fear for his life. This unnamed victim claimed that he identified the suspects in his attack, and that two other men were identified and arrested. The suspects were supposedly released an hour later due to pressure from their families, and two of the investigators were fired.<ref name=\"credit\"/> Sayenko stated in court that four days before the three suspects were arrested, police caught two men and a woman committing one of the murders. The suspects attacked the police officers but were arrested and were booked under the names of Sayenko and Suprunyuk, but they were not the men currently on trial. \"But now these details are being covered up\", Sayenko said in court. \"The investigators claim that this did not happen. But there are people, officers in the Militsiya, who on July 19, 2007 received reports that those three were arrested. [\u2026] But, alas, it turned out that the persons arrested had powerful parents. So the information was quickly suppressed, and instead my son and two of his friends were railroaded. I also believe that the girl arrested on that day has since left the country and is now in Germany.\"<ref name=\"kiev1\"/>\n\nThe defense team also claimed the prosecution withheld from the court information that exonerated their clients. Igor Sayenko claimed the police interviewed witnesses and recovered evidence from two additional murders. The suspects had a strong alibi for the time of these murders, so all information on these crimes was removed from the case.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=10600 |title=I'm 100% Convinced that my Son did not Murder Anyone! |language=Russian |access-date=2008-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103133523/http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=10600 |archive-date=2009-01-03 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n \nSayenko's defense claimed that he had a \"psychological dependence\" on Suprunyuk, whom they called the ringleader. They claimed that Suprunyuk repeatedly threatened Sayenko, and that Sayenko feared for his life. Sayenko testified in court that he was in constant fear of Suprunyuk since the 7th grade.<ref name=\"mycity\"/>\n\nThe strategy of the defense team received some support from the victims' families, who were reportedly dissatisfied with the slow-moving legal process and an alleged cover-up by the investigators. Some victims' relatives told the media they planned to begin an independent organization to monitor the court proceedings.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sayenko from Dnepropetrovsk innocent? |url=http://ric.ua/index.php?newsid=27170 |language=Russian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231085023/http://ric.ua/index.php?newsid=27170 |archivedate=2008-12-31 }}</ref> The authorities in Ukraine strongly denied that a fourth person was involved in the killings who could still be at large, and said that rumors of similar crimes taking place since the arrest of the three suspects are unfounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stb.ua/newsv.php?item.4387|title=Murders continue after arrest of Dnepropetrovsk maniacs|language=Russian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070701151420/http://stb.ua/newsv.php?item.4387|archivedate=2007-07-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Murder videos and photographs ===\nThe suspects' mobile phones and personal computers contained multiple video recordings of the murders. A video was leaked to the Internet, showing the murder of 48\u2011year-old Sergei Yatzenko. He is seen lying on his back in a wooded area, and is struck repeatedly in the face with a hammer held inside a plastic bag. One attacker stabs Yatzenko in the eye and abdomen with a screwdriver. Yatzenko is then struck with the hammer to ensure he is dead. The attack lasts over four minutes, during which the victim lapses in and out of consciousness. One murderer is seen smiling towards the camera during the video.<ref name=\"blik video\"/> The murderers walk back to their car, showing that the crime took place close to the side of a road, next to their parked car. They discuss the murder calmly, expressing mild surprise that the victim was still breathing after a screwdriver was plunged into his exposed brain. The suspects then wash their hands and the hammer with a water bottle, and begin to laugh. Only two suspects appear to be present in the video, with one always behind the camera.\n\nThe suspects were also found in possession of multiple photographs showing them attending funerals of the victims. They can be seen smiling and \"[[Finger (gesture)|flipping off]]\" the coffins and gravestones. Evidence of animal abuse was also shown in court, with the suspects posing alongside mutilated animal corpses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://exo.at.ua/news/2008-10-30-3736|title=Killers captured death of victims on video (with television news video)|publisher=exo.at.ua|language=Ukrainian|accessdate=2009-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104083242/http://exo.at.ua/news/2008-10-30-3736|archive-date=2009-11-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe photographic and video evidence was shown in court on 29 October 2008, as part of a larger presentation of over 300 photographs and two videos.<ref name=\"videos\">{{cite news|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/news/12086123.html|title=Court shocked by brutal Dnepropetrovsk maniacs video|publisher=www.segodnya.ua|author=Leontieva, Anna|language=Russian|accessdate=2009-04-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304212954/http://www.segodnya.ua/news/12086123.html|archive-date=2012-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref> The defense objected to the presentation, claiming that the evidence was obtained illegally, and that the subjects shown in the video and the photographs were digitally altered to resemble the suspects.<ref name=\":0\" /> When Sayenko and Suprunyuk were asked if they recognized the people in the photographs, they replied that they did not.

His murder took place on 12 July 2007, and his body was found on 16 July.<ref name=\"sergei\"/> Yatzenko was 48 years old. He had recently been forced into retirement due to a [[cancer]]ous [[tumor]] in his throat. The treatment left him unable to speak for some time, but Yatzenko was unhappy with being unable to work and continued to find odd jobs around the village. He took on small construction work, repaired cars, wove baskets and cooked for his family. He was beginning to regain his voice at the time he was murdered. Yatzenko was married and had two sons and one grandchild. He also looked after his disabled mother.\n\nAt around 14:30 on the day of the murder, he called his wife to say he was going to fill his motorcycle and visit his grandchild. He never arrived at his grandson's house, and his mobile phone was turned off by 18:00. His wife Lyudmila called a friend and walked around the village, afraid that her husband might have fallen ill or had a motorcycle accident. They could not locate any sign of him. They also could not file a missing person's report, since in Ukraine a person cannot be declared missing until at least 72 hours after last being seen. The next day, Lyudmila posted photographs of her husband around the village, and enlisted more local help to search the surrounding area. Four days later, a local who saw one of Lyudmila's posters remembered seeing an abandoned [[Dnipro (motorcycle)|Dnepr]] bike in a remote wooded area by a garbage dump. He took Yatzenko's relatives to the scene, where they discovered his mutilated and decomposing body.<ref name=\"sergei\"/>\n\nThe fact that Yatzenko's murder was captured on video was unknown to the public until a court session on 29 October 2008. The unedited video of the murder was shown as part of a large presentation by the prosecution, causing shock in the gallery. The court agreed with the prosecution that the video was genuine, that it showed Suprunyuk attacking the victim, and that Sayenko was the man behind the camera.<ref name=\"sergei\"/>\n\nThe video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko was leaked to a [[shock site]] based in the [[United States]] and dated 4 December 2008.

The yellow plastic bag conceals the hammer used in the attack. A longer version of the Yatzenko murder video was obtained by the Chilean [[television|TV]] documentary series ''{{lang|es|Aqu\u00ed en Vivo}}''.]]\n\nOn 2 August 2010, the [[Chile]]an television channel [[Red Televisiva Megavisi\u00f3n|MEGA]] broadcast a documentary about the case. It was titled ''{{lang|es|Los man\u00edacos del martillo}}'' (''The Hammer Maniacs'') and ran for 1 hour and 25 minutes as part of the investigative series ''{{lang|es|Aqu\u00ed en Vivo}}'' (''Here, Live''). Journalist Michele Canale flew to Dnepropetrovsk and interviewed a range of people involved in the case.\n\nThe parents of Sayenko and Suprunyuk maintained the innocence of their children, while detectives involved in the case gave their recollections, and repeated the lack of confirmation for the theory that the murder videos had been shot as [[snuff film]]s for sale overseas. Lidia Mikrenischeva, an elderly woman who survived a hammer attack and helped to identify the killers in court, was also interviewed. She recalled being struck on the head from behind and falling to the ground, but her life was saved when the dogs accompanying her barked loudly and scared off the attackers. Natalia Ilchenko, the mother of the first known victim Ekaterina Ilchenko, recalled finding her daughter unrecognizable after the hammer attack, and commented that the killers should not be compared to animals because they killed for fun.\n\nThe documentary was notable for showing a wide range of previously unseen photographs and video material from the case. From an anonymous source, the makers obtained a longer and unedited version of the mobile phone video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko on 12 July 2007. Sayenko and Suprunyuk are seen standing at the woodland roadside next to their [[Daewoo Lanos]] taxi, waiting for a suitable victim to arrive, and discussing what they are going to do. At one point, Suprunyuk is seen looking through [[binoculars]] for any approaching vehicles. He can also be seen posing with a hammer, which he conceals inside a yellow plastic bag. After 20 minutes, Sergei Yatzenko arrives on a bicycle, and is knocked to the ground before the attack in the woods next to the road begins. Yatzenko's children were asked to take part in the documentary, but declined. According to the commentary, at least five more murder videos are known to exist. The Yatzenko video was shown to the Chilean horror film director [[Jorge Olgu\u00edn (director)|Jorge Olgu\u00edn]], who was so disturbed that he was unable to watch all of it. The documentary also showed brief excerpts from a five-minute video of the murder of another victim of the maniacs, an unidentified man. At one point in the video, the killers comment that the man has a gold tooth. The man was killed with blows to the head and a knife, with some of his personal belongings taken as trophies.\n\nThe documentary also showed a video recording of Sayenko's confession, in which he admits that robbery was a motive for some of the killings. A video of Hanzha was also shown, with his face bruised after an alleged beating by the police. Michele Canale attempted to obtain an interview with the killers in prison, but was denied by the Ukrainian authorities. A range of motives for the killings was examined, and it was concluded that despite the court verdict, there are still unanswered questions about the case.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mega.cl/programas/aev/capitulos/capitulo-5-aqui-en-vivo-los-maniacos-del-martillo.html |title=Cap\u00edtulo 6 Aqu\u00ed en Vivo: 'Los man\u00edacos del martillo' |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-08-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311011756/http://www.mega.cl/programas/aev/capitulos/capitulo-5-aqui-en-vivo-los-maniacos-del-martillo.html |archivedate=2011-03-11 }}</ref>\n\n== Alleged copycat case in Irkutsk ==\n\nOn 5 April 2011, two [[Russia]]n youths, Artyom Anoufriev ({{lang-ru|\u0410\u0440\u0442\u0451\u043c \u0410\u043d\u0443\u0444\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432}}) (born 1992) and Nikita Lytkin ({{lang-ru|\u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u041b\u044b\u0442\u043a\u0438\u043d}}) (born 1993), known as the [[Academy maniacs]] ({{lang-ru|\u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a\u0438}}) were arrested in connection with six murders and attacks on residents in Akademgorodok in [[Irkutsk]].

Many were vulnerable to attack, including children, the elderly, vagrants, or people under the influence of alcohol. Most victims were killed using blunt objects, including hammers and steel construction bars. Blows were often directed at their faces, leaving them unrecognizable. Many victims were also mutilated and tortured; some victims had their eyes gouged out while they were still alive. One pregnant woman had her [[fetus]] cut from her womb. No sexual assaults on any victim were reported. Some victims were also robbed of their mobile phones and other valuables, their possessions pawned to second-hand shops in the area.

He had a [[blood phobia]], and even refused to bathe his kitten, afraid he might scald it. Suprunyuk suggested tackling the fears by torturing stray dogs.

All three lawyers were originally court-appointed, but after the initial hearings Sayenko requested to be represented by his father, because his appointed lawyer apparently graduated from law school only two months earlier.<ref name=\"kiev1\"/> The request was granted, which significantly delayed the proceedings as Sayenko's father familiarized himself with the evidence. Igor Sayenko became the most prominent figure on the defense, giving numerous interviews and taking a lead role in court proceedings.\n\nHanzha's attorneys based their defense on the fact that he never participated in the murder spree, and was involved only with a single incident four months before the killings began, in which two men were robbed in the nearby town of [[Kamianske|Dniprodzerzhynsk]]. Hanzha admitted his guilt, hoping for leniency in sentencing.<ref name=\"poleznaya\"/>\n \nThe defense strategy for the other two suspects was to attack the prosecution on a wide front. Multiple investigators were called to the stand, including the leader of the arrest team and the lead investigator in the case. The defense claimed illegal searches, improperly kept records, and problems during questioning. Igor Sayenko raised questions about the videotape of the searches conducted in the suspects' apartments. According to Sayenko, the tape constantly stops and restarts, showing the evidence obtained only after being picked up by investigators, but never the actual moment of discovery.<ref name=\"kiev1\"/> The legal team also denied that the people in the murder videos were the suspects.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', Igor Sayenko claimed that a fourth suspect named Danila Kozlov was initially charged with the murders.<ref name=\"kiev1\"/> Tatiana Shram, a sister of victim Elena Shram, also stated in an interview that she saw Kozlov's name mentioned in court documents, and that Kozlov was reportedly aware of the murders, and was with the suspects just before her sister was murdered. Shram further stated that the investigators told her that Kozlov remains free because he \"did not murder anyone,\" and that when her attorney attempted to bring up the matter in court, the judge \"asked him to sit down.\"<ref name=\"credit\">{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=12946|title=Justice on credit: The case of the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs |publisher=Dnepropetrovsk City News|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIgor Sayenko continued to speculate on the influence of the families of the \"real killers\", claiming that he conducted an interview with an escaped victim who wanted his identity kept secret for fear for his life. This unnamed victim claimed that he identified the suspects in his attack, and that two other men were identified and arrested. The suspects were supposedly released an hour later due to pressure from their families, and two of the investigators were fired.<ref name=\"credit\"/> Sayenko stated in court that four days before the three suspects were arrested, police caught two men and a woman committing one of the murders. The suspects attacked the police officers but were arrested and were booked under the names of Sayenko and Suprunyuk, but they were not the men currently on trial. \"But now these details are being covered up\", Sayenko said in court. \"The investigators claim that this did not happen. But there are people, officers in the Militsiya, who on July 19, 2007 received reports that those three were arrested. [\u2026] But, alas, it turned out that the persons arrested had powerful parents. So the information was quickly suppressed, and instead my son and two of his friends were railroaded. I also believe that the girl arrested on that day has since left the country and is now in Germany.\"<ref name=\"kiev1\"/>\n\nThe defense team also claimed the prosecution withheld from the court information that exonerated their clients. Igor Sayenko claimed the police interviewed witnesses and recovered evidence from two additional murders. The suspects had a strong alibi for the time of these murders, so all information on these crimes was removed from the case.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=10600 |title=I'm 100% Convinced that my Son did not Murder Anyone! |language=Russian |access-date=2008-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103133523/http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=10600 |archive-date=2009-01-03 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n \nSayenko's defense claimed that he had a \"psychological dependence\" on Suprunyuk, whom they called the ringleader. They claimed that Suprunyuk repeatedly threatened Sayenko, and that Sayenko feared for his life. Sayenko testified in court that he was in constant fear of Suprunyuk since the 7th grade.<ref name=\"mycity\"/>\n\nThe strategy of the defense team received some support from the victims' families, who were reportedly dissatisfied with the slow-moving legal process and an alleged cover-up by the investigators. Some victims' relatives told the media they planned to begin an independent organization to monitor the court proceedings.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sayenko from Dnepropetrovsk innocent? |url=http://ric.ua/index.php?newsid=27170 |language=Russian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231085023/http://ric.ua/index.php?newsid=27170 |archivedate=2008-12-31 }}</ref> The authorities in Ukraine strongly denied that a fourth person was involved in the killings who could still be at large, and said that rumors of similar crimes taking place since the arrest of the three suspects are unfounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stb.ua/newsv.php?item.4387|title=Murders continue after arrest of Dnepropetrovsk maniacs|language=Russian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070701151420/http://stb.ua/newsv.php?item.4387|archivedate=2007-07-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Murder videos and photographs ===\nThe suspects' mobile phones and personal computers contained multiple video recordings of the murders. A video was leaked to the Internet, showing the murder of 48\u2011year-old Sergei Yatzenko. He is seen lying on his back in a wooded area, and is struck repeatedly in the face with a hammer held inside a plastic bag. One attacker stabs Yatzenko in the eye and abdomen with a screwdriver. Yatzenko is then struck with the hammer to ensure he is dead. The attack lasts over four minutes, during which the victim lapses in and out of consciousness. One murderer is seen smiling towards the camera during the video.<ref name=\"blik video\"/> The murderers walk back to their car, showing that the crime took place close to the side of a road, next to their parked car. They discuss the murder calmly, expressing mild surprise that the victim was still breathing after a screwdriver was plunged into his exposed brain. The suspects then wash their hands and the hammer with a water bottle, and begin to laugh.

His murder took place on 12 July 2007, and his body was found on 16 July.<ref name=\"sergei\"/> Yatzenko was 48 years old. He had recently been forced into retirement due to a [[cancer]]ous [[tumor]] in his throat. The treatment left him unable to speak for some time, but Yatzenko was unhappy with being unable to work and continued to find odd jobs around the village. He took on small construction work, repaired cars, wove baskets and cooked for his family. He was beginning to regain his voice at the time he was murdered. Yatzenko was married and had two sons and one grandchild. He also looked after his disabled mother.\n\nAt around 14:30 on the day of the murder, he called his wife to say he was going to fill his motorcycle and visit his grandchild. He never arrived at his grandson's house, and his mobile phone was turned off by 18:00. His wife Lyudmila called a friend and walked around the village, afraid that her husband might have fallen ill or had a motorcycle accident. They could not locate any sign of him. They also could not file a missing person's report, since in Ukraine a person cannot be declared missing until at least 72 hours after last being seen. The next day, Lyudmila posted photographs of her husband around the village, and enlisted more local help to search the surrounding area. Four days later, a local who saw one of Lyudmila's posters remembered seeing an abandoned [[Dnipro (motorcycle)|Dnepr]] bike in a remote wooded area by a garbage dump. He took Yatzenko's relatives to the scene, where they discovered his mutilated and decomposing body.<ref name=\"sergei\"/>\n\nThe fact that Yatzenko's murder was captured on video was unknown to the public until a court session on 29 October 2008. The unedited video of the murder was shown as part of a large presentation by the prosecution, causing shock in the gallery. The court agreed with the prosecution that the video was genuine, that it showed Suprunyuk attacking the victim, and that Sayenko was the man behind the camera.<ref name=\"sergei\"/>\n\nThe video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko was leaked to a [[shock site]] based in the [[United States]] and dated 4 December 2008.

A longer version of the Yatzenko murder video was obtained by the Chilean [[television|TV]] documentary series ''{{lang|es|Aqu\u00ed en Vivo}}''.]]\n\nOn 2 August 2010, the [[Chile]]an television channel [[Red Televisiva Megavisi\u00f3n|MEGA]] broadcast a documentary about the case. It was titled ''{{lang|es|Los man\u00edacos del martillo}}'' (''The Hammer Maniacs'') and ran for 1 hour and 25 minutes as part of the investigative series ''{{lang|es|Aqu\u00ed en Vivo}}'' (''Here, Live''). Journalist Michele Canale flew to Dnepropetrovsk and interviewed a range of people involved in the case.\n\nThe parents of Sayenko and Suprunyuk maintained the innocence of their children, while detectives involved in the case gave their recollections, and repeated the lack of confirmation for the theory that the murder videos had been shot as [[snuff film]]s for sale overseas. Lidia Mikrenischeva, an elderly woman who survived a hammer attack and helped to identify the killers in court, was also interviewed. She recalled being struck on the head from behind and falling to the ground, but her life was saved when the dogs accompanying her barked loudly and scared off the attackers. Natalia Ilchenko, the mother of the first known victim Ekaterina Ilchenko, recalled finding her daughter unrecognizable after the hammer attack, and commented that the killers should not be compared to animals because they killed for fun.\n\nThe documentary was notable for showing a wide range of previously unseen photographs and video material from the case. From an anonymous source, the makers obtained a longer and unedited version of the mobile phone video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko on 12 July 2007. Sayenko and Suprunyuk are seen standing at the woodland roadside next to their [[Daewoo Lanos]] taxi, waiting for a suitable victim to arrive, and discussing what they are going to do. At one point, Suprunyuk is seen looking through [[binoculars]] for any approaching vehicles. He can also be seen posing with a hammer, which he conceals inside a yellow plastic bag. After 20 minutes, Sergei Yatzenko arrives on a bicycle, and is knocked to the ground before the attack in the woods next to the road begins. Yatzenko's children were asked to take part in the documentary, but declined. According to the commentary, at least five more murder videos are known to exist. The Yatzenko video was shown to the Chilean horror film director [[Jorge Olgu\u00edn (director)|Jorge Olgu\u00edn]], who was so disturbed that he was unable to watch all of it. The documentary also showed brief excerpts from a five-minute video of the murder of another victim of the maniacs, an unidentified man. At one point in the video, the killers comment that the man has a gold tooth. The man was killed with blows to the head and a knife, with some of his personal belongings taken as trophies.\n\nThe documentary also showed a video recording of Sayenko's confession, in which he admits that robbery was a motive for some of the killings. A video of Hanzha was also shown, with his face bruised after an alleged beating by the police. Michele Canale attempted to obtain an interview with the killers in prison, but was denied by the Ukrainian authorities. A range of motives for the killings was examined, and it was concluded that despite the court verdict, there are still unanswered questions about the case.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mega.cl/programas/aev/capitulos/capitulo-5-aqui-en-vivo-los-maniacos-del-martillo.html |title=Cap\u00edtulo 6 Aqu\u00ed en Vivo: 'Los man\u00edacos del martillo' |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-08-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311011756/http://www.mega.cl/programas/aev/capitulos/capitulo-5-aqui-en-vivo-los-maniacos-del-martillo.html |archivedate=2011-03-11 }}</ref>\n\n== Alleged copycat case in Irkutsk ==\n\nOn 5 April 2011, two [[Russia]]n youths, Artyom Anoufriev ({{lang-ru|\u0410\u0440\u0442\u0451\u043c \u0410\u043d\u0443\u0444\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432}}) (born 1992) and Nikita Lytkin ({{lang-ru|\u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u041b\u044b\u0442\u043a\u0438\u043d}}) (born 1993), known as the [[Academy maniacs]] ({{lang-ru|\u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a\u0438}}) were arrested in connection with six murders and attacks on residents in Akademgorodok in [[Irkutsk]].
