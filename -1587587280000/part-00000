It is probably Berg's best-known and most frequently performed instrumental piece, in which the composer sought to reconcile [[diatonicism]] and [[dodecaphony]]. Berg composed it on a commission from [[Louis Krasner]], and it became the last work that he completed. Krasner performed the solo part in the premiere at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]], [[Barcelona]] on 19 April 1936, after the composer's death.\n\n== Conception and composition ==\nThe piece stemmed from a commission from the [[violin]]ist [[Louis Krasner]]. When he first received the commission, Berg was working on his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and he did not begin work on the [[concerto]] for some months. The event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old [[Manon Gropius]], the daughter of [[Alma Mahler]] (once [[Gustav Mahler]]'s wife) and [[Walter Gropius]]. Berg set ''Lulu'' aside to write the concerto, which he dedicated \"To the memory of an angel\".<ref name=\"Glass\" />\n\nBerg worked on the piece very quickly, completing it within a few months; it is thought that his working on the concerto was largely responsible for his failing to complete ''Lulu'' before his death on 24 December 1935. The violin concerto was the last work that Berg completed. In a letter to Krasner dated 16 July 1935, Berg confessed: {{quote|Yesterday I finished the composition [without the orchestration] of our Violin Concerto. I am probably more surprised by it than you will be (...) the work gave me more and more joy. I hope - no, I have the confident belief - that I have succeeded.{{cn|date=April 2020}}}}<!-- looked in ''Berg: Violin Concerto'' (1991) by Anthony Pople and Julian Rushton, but can't find it there -->\n\n== Scoring ==\n[[File:Louis Krasner (1903\u20131995) und Helene Berg (1885\u20131976) mit der Partitur des Violinkonzerts (1961) OeNB 657332.png|thumb|[[Louis Krasner|Krasner]] and Berg's widow [[:de:Helene Berg|Helene]] with the score (1961)]]\nThe concerto is scored for 2 [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (both doubling as [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s (one doubling as a [[cor anglais]]), [[alto saxophone]] (doubling as 3rd clarinet), 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s, 2 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[percussion]], [[harp]] and [[string section|strings]].<ref name=\"Glass\">{{cite news\n |last         = Glass\n |first        = Herbert\n |url          = https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |title        = Violin Concerto \u2013 About the piece\n |publisher    = [[LA Phil]]\n |accessdate   = 2 November 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012243/https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |archive-date = 7 November 2017\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nBerg described the structure of the concerto in a letter to [[Arnold Schoenberg]].<ref>Brand et al. (eds.), ''The Berg-Schoenberg Correspondence'', p.466. quoted in Pople (1991) ,p.47.</ref> It is in two movements, each divided into two sections:\n\n{{ordered-list|type=upper-roman\n| {{ordered-list|type=lower-alpha\n  | Andante (Prelude)\n  | Allegretto (Scherzo)\n  }}\n| {{ordered-list|type=lower-alpha\n  | Allegro (Cadenza)\n  | Adagio (Chorale Variations)\n  }}\n}}\n\nThe work begins with an [[tempo|Andante]] in classical [[sonata form]], followed by the [[tempo|Allegretto]], a dance-like section. The second movement starts with an [[tempo|Allegro]] largely based on a single recurring [[rhythm]]ic [[cell (music)|cell]]; this section has been described as [[cadenza]]-like, with very difficult passages in the solo part. The orchestration becomes rather violent at its climax (which is literally marked in the score as \"High point of the Allegro\"); the fourth and final section, marked [[tempo|Adagio]], is in a much calmer mood. The first two sections are meant to represent life, the last two death and [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfiguration]].\n\n[[Image:Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.png|thumb|right|400px|\"lament\" melody and its construction from the pitches of RI-5 and P-8<ref>Whittall, Arnold. 2008.

New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68200-8}} (pbk).</ref> {{audio|Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.mid|Play}}]]\n\nLike a number of other works by Berg, the piece combines the [[twelve tone technique]], typical of [[Serialism|serialistic music]] learned from his teacher [[Arnold Schoenberg]] with passages written in a freer, more tonal style. The score integrates serialism and tonality in a remarkable fashion. Here is Berg's tone row:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\new Staff \\with { \\remove \"Time_signature_engraver\" \\remove \"Bar_engraver\" } \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\override Stem #'transparent = ##t g4 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f } </score>\nAlthough this contains all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], there is a strong tonal undercurrent: the first three notes of the row make up a [[G minor]] [[Triad (music)|triad]]; notes three to five are a [[D major]] triad; notes five to seven are an [[A minor]] triad; notes seven to nine are an [[E major]] triad;\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\time 2/4 r8 <d bes>4( <d bes>8~ | <d bes> <d a>4 <d a>8~ | <d a>) <c a>4( <c a>8~ | <c a> <b e,>4 <b e,>8) } \\new Staff \\relative c { \\clef bass \\time 2/4 g,2( | fis' | e' | gis, } >> } </score>\nand the last four notes (B, C{{music|#}}, E{{music|b}}, F) and the first (G) together make up part of a [[whole tone scale]].  The roots of the four triads correspond to the [[Open string (music)|open strings]] of the violin, which is highlighted in the opening passage of the piece.\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\numericTimeSignature \\time 4/4 g8(\\pp d' a' e') e( a, d, g,~ | g1) } </score>\nThe resulting triads are thus fifth-related and form a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], which we hear directly before the row is played by the violin for the first time.  Moreover, the four chords above imply the note sequence  B (B{{music|flat}}) \u2013 A \u2013 C \u2013 H (B{{music|natural}}) which forms the [[BACH motif]], thus connecting the piece to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], whose music plays a crucial role in this concerto. \n\nThe last four notes of the row, ascending whole tones, are also the first four notes of the [[chorale]] melody of \"[[Es ist genug]]\" (It is enough), another part of the whole tone scale. Bach composed a [[SATB|four-part]] setting of the hymn by [[Franz Joachim Burmeister]] with a melody by [[Johann Rudolph Ahle]] to conclude his cantata [[O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60|''O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort'', BWV 60]] (O eternity, you word of thunder).<ref>[http://www.bach-chorales.com/BWV0060_5.htm BWV 60.5] bach-chorales.com</ref> The first four measures are shown below.\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n   \\new PianoStaff <<\n      \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             \\[ f2 g4 a \n             b2 \\] r4 b\n             c4 g g bes! \n             a2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemDown\n              c2 c4 bes8 a \n              e'2 s4 e\n              e4. f8 e d e c \n              f2.\n              }\n            >>\n     \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef bass \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             a2 g4 d' \n             d2 r4 gis,\n             a8 b c4 c c \n             c2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c {\n             \\stemDown\n             f2 e4 fis \n             gis2 s4 e\n             a8 g!16 f e8 d c bes! a g!\n             f2.\n             }\n         >>\n    >>\n</score>\n\nBerg quotes this chorale directly in the last movement of the piece, where Bach's harmonization is heard in the [[clarinet]]s. \n\nThere is another directly quoted tonal passage in the work in the form of a [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] [[folk song]] in the second section of the first movement, which returns briefly before the [[Coda (music)|coda]] in the second movement.

Reports vary as to whether he was ill or was emotionally unable to cope with the subject matter of the music.  In any case, Scherchen happened to be there for the Festival, and he was drafted at literally the 11th hour.  The first time he ever saw the score was at 11 pm the night before the premiere, and the next morning there was time for only half an hour rehearsal.<ref name=kras>[http://www.schoenberg.at/library/index.php/attachments/single/1535 Louis Krasner, ''Some Memories of Anton Webern, the Berg Concerto and Vienna in the 1930s'']</ref>\n* British private premiere: 1 May 1936, [[London]], at an invitation-only concert.

It is probably Berg's best-known and most frequently performed instrumental piece, in which the composer sought to reconcile [[diatonicism]] and [[dodecaphony]]. Berg composed it on a commission from [[Louis Krasner]], and it became the last work that he completed. Krasner performed the solo part in the premiere at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]], [[Barcelona]] on 19 April 1936, after the composer's death.\n\n== Conception and composition ==\nThe piece stemmed from a commission from the [[violin]]ist [[Louis Krasner]]. When he first received the commission, Berg was working on his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and he did not begin work on the [[concerto]] for some months. The event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old [[Manon Gropius]], the daughter of [[Alma Mahler]] (once [[Gustav Mahler]]'s wife) and [[Walter Gropius]]. Berg set ''Lulu'' aside to write the concerto, which he dedicated \"To the memory of an angel\".<ref name=\"Glass\" />\n\nBerg worked on the piece very quickly, completing it within a few months; it is thought that his working on the concerto was largely responsible for his failing to complete ''Lulu'' before his death on 24 December 1935. The violin concerto was the last work that Berg completed. In a letter to Krasner dated 16 July 1935, Berg confessed: {{quote|Yesterday I finished the composition [without the orchestration] of our Violin Concerto. I am probably more surprised by it than you will be (...) the work gave me more and more joy. I hope - no, I have the confident belief - that I have succeeded.{{cn|date=April 2020}}}}<!-- looked in ''Berg: Violin Concerto'' (1991) by Anthony Pople and Julian Rushton, but can't find it there -->\n\n== Scoring ==\n[[File:Louis Krasner (1903\u20131995) und Helene Berg (1885\u20131976) mit der Partitur des Violinkonzerts (1961) OeNB 657332.png|thumb|[[Louis Krasner|Krasner]] and Berg's widow [[:de:Helene Berg|Helene]] with the score (1961)]]\nThe concerto is scored for 2 [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (both doubling as [[piccolo]]), 2 [[oboe]]s (one doubling as a [[cor anglais]]), [[alto saxophone]] (doubling as 3rd clarinet), 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]], 2 [[trumpet]]s, 2 [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[percussion]], [[harp]] and [[string section|strings]].<ref name=\"Glass\">{{cite news\n |last         = Glass\n |first        = Herbert\n |url          = https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |title        = Violin Concerto \u2013 About the piece\n |publisher    = [[LA Phil]]\n |accessdate   = 2 November 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012243/https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/music/violin-concerto-alban-berg\n |archive-date = 7 November 2017\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Music ==\nBerg described the structure of the concerto in a letter to [[Arnold Schoenberg]].<ref>Brand et al. (eds.), ''The Berg-Schoenberg Correspondence'', p.466. quoted in Pople (1991) ,p.47.</ref> It is in two movements, each divided into two sections:\n\n{{ordered-list|type=upper-roman\n| {{ordered-list|type=lower-alpha\n  | Andante (Prelude)\n  | Allegretto (Scherzo)\n  }}\n| {{ordered-list|type=lower-alpha\n  | Allegro (Cadenza)\n  | Adagio (Chorale Variations)\n  }}\n}}\n\nThe work begins with an [[tempo|Andante]] in classical [[sonata form]], followed by the [[tempo|Allegretto]], a dance-like section. The second movement starts with an [[tempo|Allegro]] largely based on a single recurring [[rhythm]]ic [[cell (music)|cell]]; this section has been described as [[cadenza]]-like, with very difficult passages in the solo part. The orchestration becomes rather violent at its climax (which is literally marked in the score as \"High point of the Allegro\"); the fourth and final section, marked [[tempo|Adagio]], is in a much calmer mood. The first two sections are meant to represent life, the last two death and [[Transfiguration (religion)|transfiguration]].\n\n[[Image:Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.png|thumb|right|400px|\"lament\" melody and its construction from the pitches of RI-5 and P-8<ref>Whittall, Arnold. 2008.

New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68200-8}} (pbk).</ref> {{audio|Berg - Violin Concerto lament melody.mid|Play}}]]\n\nLike a number of other works by Berg, the piece combines the [[twelve tone technique]], typical of [[Serialism|serialistic music]] learned from his teacher [[Arnold Schoenberg]] with passages written in a freer, more tonal style. The score integrates serialism and tonality in a remarkable fashion. Here is Berg's tone row:\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\new Staff \\with { \\remove \"Time_signature_engraver\" \\remove \"Bar_engraver\" } \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\override Stem #'transparent = ##t g4 bes d fis a c e gis b cis ees f } </score>\nAlthough this contains all twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], there is a strong tonal undercurrent: the first three notes of the row make up a [[G minor]] [[Triad (music)|triad]]; notes three to five are a [[D major]] triad; notes five to seven are an [[A minor]] triad; notes seven to nine are an [[E major]] triad;\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> { \\new PianoStaff << \\new Staff \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\time 2/4 r8 <d bes>4( <d bes>8~ | <d bes> <d a>4 <d a>8~ | <d a>) <c a>4( <c a>8~ | <c a> <b e,>4 <b e,>8) } \\new Staff \\relative c { \\clef bass \\time 2/4 g,2( | fis' | e' | gis, } >> } </score>\nand the last four notes (B, C{{music|#}}, E{{music|b}}, F) and the first (G) together make up part of a [[whole tone scale]].  The roots of the four triads correspond to the [[Open string (music)|open strings]] of the violin, which is highlighted in the opening passage of the piece.\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\numericTimeSignature \\time 4/4 g8(\\pp d' a' e') e( a, d, g,~ | g1) } </score>\nThe resulting triads are thus fifth-related and form a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], which we hear directly before the row is played by the violin for the first time.  Moreover, the four chords above imply the note sequence  B (B{{music|flat}}) \u2013 A \u2013 C \u2013 H (B{{music|natural}}) which forms the [[BACH motif]], thus connecting the piece to [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], whose music plays a crucial role in this concerto. \n\nThe last four notes of the row, ascending whole tones, are also the first four notes of the [[chorale]] melody of \"[[Es ist genug]]\" (It is enough), another part of the whole tone scale. Bach composed a [[SATB|four-part]] setting of the hymn by [[Franz Joachim Burmeister]] with a melody by [[Johann Rudolph Ahle]] to conclude his cantata [[O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, BWV 60|''O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort'', BWV 60]] (O eternity, you word of thunder).<ref>[http://www.bach-chorales.com/BWV0060_5.htm BWV 60.5] bach-chorales.com</ref> The first four measures are shown below.\n\n: <score lang=\"lilypond\" vorbis=\"1\">\n   \\new PianoStaff <<\n      \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef treble \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             \\[ f2 g4 a \n             b2 \\] r4 b\n             c4 g g bes! \n             a2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemDown\n              c2 c4 bes8 a \n              e'2 s4 e\n              e4. f8 e d e c \n              f2.\n              }\n            >>\n     \\new Staff <<\n         \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n             \\stemUp \\clef bass \\key f \\major \\time 4/4\n             a2 g4 d' \n             d2 r4 gis,\n             a8 b c4 c c \n             c2.\n             }\n         \\new Voice \\relative c {\n             \\stemDown\n             f2 e4 fis \n             gis2 s4 e\n             a8 g!16 f e8 d c bes! a g!\n             f2.\n             }\n         >>\n    >>\n</score>\n\nBerg quotes this chorale directly in the last movement of the piece, where Bach's harmonization is heard in the [[clarinet]]s. \n\nThere is another directly quoted tonal passage in the work in the form of a [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthian]] [[folk song]] in the second section of the first movement, which returns briefly before the [[Coda (music)|coda]] in the second movement. This is perhaps the only section which does not derive its materials from the row.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n:<score vorbis=\"1\"> \\relative c' { \\clef treble \\key g \\major \\time 3/4 \\partial 4*1 << { d4 | b'8. b16 d4 g8 b | b,4 d g | fis4. e8 e4 | c2. | c'4. fis,8 d4 | c' fis, d8 c' | b2 g8 b | d,2 } \\\\ { d,4 | g8. g16 b4 d | g, b e | d4. c8 c4 | fis,2. | fis'4. d8 c4 | fis d c8 fis | g2 d8 d | b2 } >> } </score>\n\nAnthony Pople describes the work as \"less serial than ''Lulu''\", containing originally serial material later repeated or developed outside that framework, in addition to small adjustments throughout to avoid bare octaves.<ref>Pople, Anthony (1991).

They are often played when the audience is encouraged to think. \"Turquoise\" is often used, usually when big, astonishing, or otherwise significant facts or ideas are mentioned. \"Flan\" is often used for sad or abstract facts. \"Rainstorms and Rainbows (I Am the Hero)\", \"Going Down\", and \"Flan\" are played at the end of videos. \"192-1\", \"White\", \"For You\", \"Meet Men and Party (All Night)\", \"Banana\", \"Ducking\", \"Buildings and Bikes\", \"Shallow Anne\", \"Button\", \"Olive\", and \"Muff Mittens\" are also often used in Vsauce2 and Vsauce3.\n\nIn the video \"The Moon Terminator Illusion\", Chudnow's vinyl album ''Shona EP'' was the focus object against the wall when showing the visual effects of zooming and moving on nearby objects (a Vsauce mug) and distant ones (the EP).\n\n== Notable collaborations and other appearances ==\nVsauce has collaborated with Henry Reich of [[MinutePhysics]] on two videos: \"Guns in Space\"<ref name=Gizmodo2/> and \"What if the Earth were Hollow?\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Keith Shaw|url=http://www.itworld.com/virtualization/291747/science-monday-minutephysics-teams-vsauce-what-if-palooza|title=Science Monday: MinutePhysics teams with VSauce for a What-if-a-palooza|work=IT World|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Vsauce has also collaborated with [[The Periodic Table of Videos|Periodic Videos]]<ref>\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/feature_vsauce_visit.htm|title=Vsauce Visit \u2013 The Periodic Table of Videos|work=Periodic Videos|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfCp7CPx-M|title=Standard Weight (feat.

The channel also houses educational content via a segment known as ''Michael's Toys''.

One of the most recognizable pieces of his music is \"Moon Men\", which is used in the original Vsauce channel and is often played whenever Stevens poses a mysterious question or makes a mysterious statement. Other pieces of music used by the channels include \"145-(Poodles)\", \"Sunday\", \"It's Good to be D\", \"Hydrogen\", \"Darwin\", \"Carlin Dream\", \"Lions Tigers and Apes Part II\", \"Hanami\", \"Pressed Pennies\", \"Keith\" and \"Shona\". They are often played when the audience is encouraged to think. \"Turquoise\" is often used, usually when big, astonishing, or otherwise significant facts or ideas are mentioned. \"Flan\" is often used for sad or abstract facts. \"Rainstorms and Rainbows (I Am the Hero)\", \"Going Down\", and \"Flan\" are played at the end of videos. \"192-1\", \"White\", \"For You\", \"Meet Men and Party (All Night)\", \"Banana\", \"Ducking\", \"Buildings and Bikes\", \"Shallow Anne\", \"Button\", \"Olive\", and \"Muff Mittens\" are also often used in Vsauce2 and Vsauce3.\n\nIn the video \"The Moon Terminator Illusion\", Chudnow's vinyl album ''Shona EP'' was the focus object against the wall when showing the visual effects of zooming and moving on nearby objects (a Vsauce mug) and distant ones (the EP).\n\n== Notable collaborations and other appearances ==\nVsauce has collaborated with Henry Reich of [[MinutePhysics]] on two videos: \"Guns in Space\"<ref name=Gizmodo2/> and \"What if the Earth were Hollow?\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Keith Shaw|url=http://www.itworld.com/virtualization/291747/science-monday-minutephysics-teams-vsauce-what-if-palooza|title=Science Monday: MinutePhysics teams with VSauce for a What-if-a-palooza|work=IT World|date=August 27, 2012|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> Vsauce has also collaborated with [[The Periodic Table of Videos|Periodic Videos]]<ref>\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.periodicvideos.com/videos/feature_vsauce_visit.htm|title=Vsauce Visit \u2013 The Periodic Table of Videos|work=Periodic Videos|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}\n*{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGfCp7CPx-M|title=Standard Weight (feat.

In a common variant, the '''suspended span''', the cantilever arms do not meet in the center; instead, they support a central [[truss bridge]] which rests on the ends of the cantilever arms. The suspended span may be built off-site and lifted into place, or constructed in place using special travelling supports.\n\n{{clear}}\n[[File:CooperRiverBridge.svg|500px|thumb|center|A diagram of the parts of the [[John P. Grace Memorial Bridge]] ]]\n{{clear}}\n\nA common way to construct steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a '''balanced cantilever'''; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing arms are called '''anchor arms'''. Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, there are four cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two anchor arms which extend away from the obstacle. Because of the need for more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The [[Commodore Barry Bridge]] is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.\n\nSteel truss cantilevers support loads by [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] of the upper members and [[compression (physical)|compression]] of the lower ones. Commonly, the structure distributes the tension via the anchor arms to the outermost supports, while the compression is carried to the foundations beneath the central towers. Many truss cantilever bridges use pinned joints and are therefore [[statically determinate]] with no members carrying mixed loads.\n\nPrestressed concrete balanced cantilever bridges are often built using [[Segmental bridge|segmental construction]].\n\n== Construction methods==\nSome steel arch bridges (such as the [[Navajo Bridge]]) are built using pure cantilever spans from each side, with neither falsework below nor temporary supporting towers and cables above. These are then joined with a pin, usually after forcing the union point apart, and when jacks are removed and the bridge decking is added the bridge becomes a [[truss arch bridge]]. Such unsupported construction is only possible where appropriate rock is available to support the tension in the upper chord of the span during construction, usually limiting this method to the spanning of narrow canyons.\n\n[[File:SFOBB-OldEastSpanDismantleCropped.png|500px|thumb|center|The old eastern span of the [[San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge]], pictured in August 2014, is deconstructed in nearly the reverse order of its construction.

Tim is contacted by the police of Ryme City, a city where humans and Pok\u00e9mon live together in harmony; catching and battling Pok\u00e9mon is outlawed. He is informed by Harry's friend and Ryme City police detective, Hideo Yoshida, that Harry was killed in a car accident.\n\nTim goes to Harry's apartment to sort things out and meets a [[deerstalker]]-clad [[Pikachu]] that can talk and be understood by him, though all others simply hear him say \"Pika.\" Tim accidentally releases a mysterious purple gas, \"R,\" from a vial he finds in Harry's office; they are then attacked by a party of [[Aipom]]{{efn|name=plural|As written in [[Pok\u00e9mon#Name|the \"Name\" section of the main ''Pok\u00e9mon'' article]], \"' Pok\u00e9mon' is [[English plurals#Nouns with identical singular and plural|identical in the singular and plural]], as is each individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say 'one Pok\u00e9mon' and 'many Pok\u00e9mon', as well as 'one Pikachu' and 'many Pikachu'.\"<ref name=\"KaufeldSmith2006\">{{cite book|author1=John Kaufeld|author2=Jeremy Smith|title=Trading Card Games For Dummies|url=https://archive.org/details/tradingcardgames00kauf|url-access=registration|accessdate=April 25, 2013|page=[https://archive.org/details/tradingcardgames00kauf/page/n364 81]|date=June 13, 2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-04407-0|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}} who become rabid under the gas's influence.\n\nThe pair escape and Pikachu explains he has [[amnesia]] and his only clue to his identity is Harry's name and address on his cap, leading him to believe he was Harry's partner and that Harry survived the crash. They meet an informant of Harry's, a [[Mr. Mime]] who directs them to an underground illegal Pok\u00e9mon battle arena. The arena's owner Sebastian recognizes Pikachu, who had injured his [[Charizard]] in a previous battle, and demands a rematch. He doses Charizard with the purple gas, stirring it into a violent rage, and Pikachu is unable to summon his electrical powers to fight back. While attempting to save Pikachu, Tim knocks Sebastian over and breaks several gas vials in his jacket, sending the arena's Pok\u00e9mon into a frenzy. The arena is raided by police and Tim is taken by Lieutenant Yoshida, who worked with his father.\n\nTim and Pikachu are contacted by Howard Clifford, the wheelchair-bound founder of Ryme City and founder of Clifford Industries. Howard reveals Harry survived and was taken by an advanced form of [[Mewtwo]], who erased Pikachu's memory. He warns Tim that his son Roger is behind the gas, \"R\", and if he finds Mewtwo, he can find his father. Tim and Pikachu recruit aspiring journalist Lucy Stevens and travel to the lab facility Harry was investigating. The lab had been experimenting on Mewtwo and synthesized R from its genes. They are attacked by genetically enhanced [[Greninja]] and Pikachu is gravely injured. Tim begs a [[Bulbasaur]] for a healer Pok\u00e9mon and it leads him to Mewtwo, who heals Pikachu. Mewtwo is then captured by Roger. Pikachu remembers that he helped Mewtwo escape from the lab and believes he had betrayed Harry. Not trusting himself, he leaves Tim.\n\nPikachu comes across the scene of the car crash and finds evidence that it was the Greninja, not Mewtwo, who was responsible. In Ryme City, Howard reveals the captured Mewtwo to Tim, exposing himself as the true mastermind: he takes control of Mewtwo's body using a [[Brain\u2013computer interface|neural-link]] helmet that places his mind inside Mewtwo's while his body remains in the wheelchair. He explains that Mewtwo can fuse humans and Pok\u00e9mon, allowing humans to evolve as Pok\u00e9mon can and become one with them, but this can only be done if the Pok\u00e9mon is in a confused state, thus the need for the R gas. This also means that disabilities like Howard's won't exist. Believing this is the future of humankind, Howard releases the gas across the city and begins fusing humans with their Pok\u00e9mon. Pikachu summons his electrical powers to battle Mewtwo while Tim fights Howard's genetically-modified [[Ditto (Pokemon)|Ditto]], who had been impersonating Roger: the real Roger had been tied up and gagged by his father. Tim manages to remove Howard's helmet from his body, freeing Mewtwo from his control.\n\nMewtwo restores the city inhabitants to normal, Howard is arrested, and Roger hires Lucy as a full-time reporter, promising the city that he will fix his father's mistakes. Mewtwo explains that Harry tried to save him from Howard and helped Mewtwo escape, but was attacked by the Greninja. Pikachu had volunteered to have himself fused with Harry to save his life, the experience erasing both their memories. Mewtwo separates the two and Harry reunites with Tim in his human body.\n\nTim decides to stay in Ryme City to become a detective and spend more time with his father and Pikachu.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Harry Goodman, Tim's missing father and a veteran Ryme City police detective.\n* [[Justice Smith]] as Tim Goodman, a former [[Pok\u00e9mon trainer]] looking for his missing father.

Tim is contacted by the police of Ryme City, a city where humans and Pok\u00e9mon live together in harmony; catching and battling Pok\u00e9mon is outlawed. He is informed by Harry's friend and Ryme City police detective, Hideo Yoshida, that Harry was killed in a car accident.\n\nTim goes to Harry's apartment to sort things out and meets a [[deerstalker]]-clad [[Pikachu]] that can talk and be understood by him, though all others simply hear him say \"Pika.\" Tim accidentally releases a mysterious purple gas, \"R,\" from a vial he finds in Harry's office; they are then attacked by a party of [[Aipom]]{{efn|name=plural|As written in [[Pok\u00e9mon#Name|the \"Name\" section of the main ''Pok\u00e9mon'' article]], \"' Pok\u00e9mon' is [[English plurals#Nouns with identical singular and plural|identical in the singular and plural]], as is each individual species name; it is grammatically correct to say 'one Pok\u00e9mon' and 'many Pok\u00e9mon', as well as 'one Pikachu' and 'many Pikachu'.\"<ref name=\"KaufeldSmith2006\">{{cite book|author1=John Kaufeld|author2=Jeremy Smith|title=Trading Card Games For Dummies|url=https://archive.org/details/tradingcardgames00kauf|url-access=registration|accessdate=April 25, 2013|page=[https://archive.org/details/tradingcardgames00kauf/page/n364 81]|date=June 13, 2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-04407-0|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}} who become rabid under the gas's influence.\n\nThe pair escape and Pikachu explains he has [[amnesia]] and his only clue to his identity is Harry's name and address on his cap, leading him to believe he was Harry's partner and that Harry survived the crash. They meet an informant of Harry's, a [[Mr. Mime]] who directs them to an underground illegal Pok\u00e9mon battle arena. The arena's owner Sebastian recognizes Pikachu, who had injured his [[Charizard]] in a previous battle, and demands a rematch. He doses Charizard with the purple gas, stirring it into a violent rage, and Pikachu is unable to summon his electrical powers to fight back. While attempting to save Pikachu, Tim knocks Sebastian over and breaks several gas vials in his jacket, sending the arena's Pok\u00e9mon into a frenzy. The arena is raided by police and Tim is taken by Lieutenant Yoshida, who worked with his father.\n\nTim and Pikachu are contacted by Howard Clifford, the wheelchair-bound founder of Ryme City and founder of Clifford Industries. Howard reveals Harry survived and was taken by an advanced form of [[Mewtwo]], who erased Pikachu's memory. He warns Tim that his son Roger is behind the gas, \"R\", and if he finds Mewtwo, he can find his father. Tim and Pikachu recruit aspiring journalist Lucy Stevens and travel to the lab facility Harry was investigating. The lab had been experimenting on Mewtwo and synthesized R from its genes. They are attacked by genetically enhanced [[Greninja]] and Pikachu is gravely injured. Tim begs a [[Bulbasaur]] for a healer Pok\u00e9mon and it leads him to Mewtwo, who heals Pikachu. Mewtwo is then captured by Roger. Pikachu remembers that he helped Mewtwo escape from the lab and believes he had betrayed Harry. Not trusting himself, he leaves Tim.\n\nPikachu comes across the scene of the car crash and finds evidence that it was the Greninja, not Mewtwo, who was responsible. In Ryme City, Howard reveals the captured Mewtwo to Tim, exposing himself as the true mastermind: he takes control of Mewtwo's body using a [[Brain\u2013computer interface|neural-link]] helmet that places his mind inside Mewtwo's while his body remains in the wheelchair. He explains that Mewtwo can fuse humans and Pok\u00e9mon, allowing humans to evolve as Pok\u00e9mon can and become one with them, but this can only be done if the Pok\u00e9mon is in a confused state, thus the need for the R gas. This also means that disabilities like Howard's won't exist. Believing this is the future of humankind, Howard releases the gas across the city and begins fusing humans with their Pok\u00e9mon. Pikachu summons his electrical powers to battle Mewtwo while Tim fights Howard's genetically-modified [[Ditto (Pokemon)|Ditto]], who had been impersonating Roger: the real Roger had been tied up and gagged by his father. Tim manages to remove Howard's helmet from his body, freeing Mewtwo from his control.\n\nMewtwo restores the city inhabitants to normal, Howard is arrested, and Roger hires Lucy as a full-time reporter, promising the city that he will fix his father's mistakes. Mewtwo explains that Harry tried to save him from Howard and helped Mewtwo escape, but was attacked by the Greninja. Pikachu had volunteered to have himself fused with Harry to save his life, the experience erasing both their memories. Mewtwo separates the two and Harry reunites with Tim in his human body.\n\nTim decides to stay in Ryme City to become a detective and spend more time with his father and Pikachu.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Harry Goodman, Tim's missing father and a veteran Ryme City police detective.\n* [[Justice Smith]] as Tim Goodman, a former [[Pok\u00e9mon trainer]] looking for his missing father.

It has a 1.3 m modified [[Ritchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien telescope]] and a 0.3 m [[Schmidt\u2013Cassegrain telescope]], which are operated by the [[University of Crete]] and the [[Foundation for Research & Technology \u2013 Hellas]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://skinakas.physics.uoc.gr/en/|title=Skinakas Observatory|website=skinakas.physics.uoc.gr|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>. \n\n== History ==\nThe idea to create a site of astronomical research at Skinakas was conceived in the summer of 1984. Soon after the construction of a road to the mountain peak commenced. The [[University of Crete]], the [[Foundation for Research & Technology \u2013 Hellas|Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas]] (FORTH, former Research Center of Crete) and the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics|Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Extraterrestrische Physik]] ([[Germany]]) agreed to build and operate together a telescope with the purpose of providing modern education in Astronomy to University students and also of supporting astronomical observations with emphasis on the research of extended sky objects such as [[Comet|comets]] and [[Nebula|gaseous nebulae]]. The first Director of Skinakas Observatory was Prof. Ioannis Papamastorakis<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.physics.uoc.gr/en/faculty/i.papamastorakis|title=Papamastorakis Ioannis {{!}} Department of Physics|website=www.physics.uoc.gr|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>, who led the development of the Observatory until his retirement in 2009. \n\nThe expected arrival of [[Halley's Comet|comet Halley]] in the Spring of 1986, after 76 years of wandering through the solar system, set the time schedule for the installation of the telescope, which having a wide field of view, and equipped with a highly sensitive electronic camera was especially suited for the observation of the comet. Indeed, after the construction of the road on the rocky mountain and the completion of the first stone-made observatory, hundreds of people from all over Greece, among them many officials (including Vaso Papandreou, then alternate minister of Industry, Energy and Technology), came to Skinakas in the Spring 1986, in order to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the Observatory on April 12, 1986<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.patris.gr/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/30626.jpg|title=Newspaper \"\u03a0\u0391\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a3\" 13 Apr. 1986 - Inauguration of Skinakas Observatory|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, as well as to observe comet Halley. In 1988 the construction of the guesthouse, also made out of stone, was completed and immediately hosted the first school of Observational Astrophysics in Greece.\n\nThe successful installation and operation of the first small, 0.3m diameter telescope, confirmed the excellent weather conditions at the top of Skinakas for high quality astronomical observations in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] region. As a result, the partner institutions decided to further develop the Observatory by installing a larger and more modern [[Ritchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien telescope|Ritchey-Chr\u00e9tien]] type telescope with a mirror diameter of 1.3 meters. The telescope, which commenced operations in the fall of 1995, was placed in a metal building to minimize local thermal disturbances ([[Astronomical seeing|atmospheric turbulence]]). The 1.3m telescope was built using high standards of sharpness and wide field of view. These properties ensure excellent imagery and study of extended objects such as [[Galaxy|galaxies]], [[Star cluster|star clusters]] and [[Nebula|gaseous nebulae]]. To further improve the observation of extended objects, a focal reducer had been developed which nearly doubles the field of view while offering the possibility of spectroscopy.\n\nIn 2006, in collaboration with the [[University of T\u00fcbingen|University of Tuebingen]], a third 0.6m telescope was installed. This [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassagrain telescope]], called \"Ganymede\" is fully robotic and web-driven and has a 29.3' x 19.5' field of view. Due to current refurbishing of the [[Observatory|dome]] the telescope will become again operational in 2021.\n\nSince 2019 the operation of Skinakas Observatory is supported by personnel of the Institute of Astrophysics - FORTH and of the Dept. of Physics, of the Univ. of Crete. Its current Director is Prof. Vassilis Charmandaris<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ia.forth.gr/people/Charmandaris|title=Prof V.

It has a 1.3 m modified [[Ritchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien telescope]] and a 0.3 m [[Schmidt\u2013Cassegrain telescope]], which are mainly operated by staff of the [[University of Crete]] and the [[Foundation for Research & Technology \u2013 Hellas]]<ref>[http://www.forth.gr/index_main.php?c=4&l=e Skinakas Observatory]</ref>. \n\n== History ==\nThe idea to create a site of astronomical research at Skinakas was conceived in the summer of 1984. Soon after the construction of a road to the mountain peak commenced. The [[University of Crete]], the [[Foundation for Research & Technology \u2013 Hellas|Foundation for Research and Technology - Hellas]] (FORTH, former Research Center of Crete) and the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics|Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Extraterrestrische Physik]] (Germany) agreed to build and operate together a telescope with the purpose of providing modern education in Astronomy to University students and also of supporting astronomical observations with emphasis on the research of extended sky objects like comets and gaseous nebulae. The first Director of Skinakas Observatory was Prof. Ioannis Papamastorakis<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.physics.uoc.gr/en/faculty/i.papamastorakis|title=Papamastorakis Ioannis {{!}} Department of Physics|website=www.physics.uoc.gr|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>, who led the development of the Observatory until his retirement in 2009. \n\nThe expected arrival of [[Halley's Comet|comet Halley]] in the Spring of 1986, after 76 years of wandering through the solar system, set the time schedule for the installation of the telescope, which having a wide field of view, and equipped with a highly sensitive electronic camera was especially suited for the observation of the comet. Indeed, after the construction of the road on the rocky mountain and the completion of the first stone-made observatory, hundreds of people from all over Greece, among them many officials (including Vaso Papandreou, then alternate minister of Industry, Energy and Technology), came to Skinakas in the Spring 1986, in order to participate in the inauguration ceremony of the Observatory on April 12, 1986<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.patris.gr/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/30626.jpg|title=Newspaper \"\u03a0\u0391\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a3\" 13 Apr. 1986 - Inauguration of Skinakas Observatory|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, as well as to observe of the comet Halley. In 1988 the construction of the guesthouse, also made out of stone, was completed and immediately hosted the first school of Observational Astrophysics in Greece.\n\nThe successful installation and operation of the first small, 0.3m diameter telescope, confirmed the excellent weather conditions at the top of Skinakas for high quality astronomical observations in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] region. As a result the partner institutions decided to further develop the Observatory by installing a larger and more modern [[Ritchey\u2013Chr\u00e9tien telescope|Ritchey-Chr\u00e9tien]] type telescope with a diameter of 1.3 meters. The telescope, which commenced operations in the fall of 1995, was placed in a metal building to minimize local thermal disturbances ([[Astronomical seeing|atmospheric turbulence]]). The 1.3m telescope was built using high standards of sharpness and wide field of view. These properties ensure excellent imagery and study of extended objects such as [[Galaxy|galaxies]], [[Star cluster|star clusters]] and [[Nebula|gaseous nebulae]]. To further improve the observation of extended objects, a focal reducer had been developed which \u00a0nearly doubles the field of view while offering the possibility of spectroscopy.\n\nIn 2006, in collaboration with the [[University of T\u00fcbingen|University of Tuebingen]], a third 0.6m telescope was installed at Skinakas Observatory. This [[Cassegrain reflector|Cassagrain telescope]], called \"Ganymede\" is fully robotic and web-driven and has a 29.3' x 19.5' field of view. Due to current refurbishing of the [[Observatory|dome]] the telescope will become again operational in 2021.\n\nSince 2019 the operation of Skinakas Observatory is supported by personnel of the Institute of Astrophysics - FORTH and of the Dept. of Physics, of the Univ. of Crete. Its current Director is Prof. Vassilis Charmandaris<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ia.forth.gr/people/Charmandaris|title=Prof V.

After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label [[ForeFront Records]]. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut ''[[Skillet (album)|Skillet]]''. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States.\n\nCooper has said the band's name was meant to be humorous, as the other founding members had already been in other bands, each with a different sound and style. The pastor of Covenant Community Church in Memphis\u2013where the band was formed as a worship band side project\u2013gave them their name as he felt they were like \"southern cooking, where you just toss a bunch of different things into a big ol' skillet and see what it turns out like.\"<ref name=\"EofCCM\">{{Cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark Allan |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/832 |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers |year=2002 |isbn=1-56563-679-1 |location=Peabody, Massachusetts |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/832 832]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/skillet-christian-rock-music-summer-concert |title=Christian rock band 'Skillet' explains how it got its name |last=Parke |first=Caleb |date=July 26, 2019 |publisher=Fox News Channel}}</ref>\n\nSkillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled ''[[Hey You, I Love Your Soul]]'', which was released in April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band's first release. With this release, Skillet abandoned their post-grunge approach for a lighter alternative rock and style. Cooper's wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate his performance duties.\n\n=== ''Invincible'', ''Ardent Worship'', and ''Alien Youth'' (2000\u201302) ===\nShortly before the band began recording for their third album, ''[[Invincible (Skillet album)|Invincible]]'', Steorts left to be with his family and launch [[Visible School|Visible Music College]], a modern music ministry college located in Memphis, and Kevin Haaland joined the band as their new guitarist.

The band currently consists of husband [[John Cooper (musician)|John]] (lead vocals, bass) and wife Korey Cooper (rhythm guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) along with [[Jen Ledger]] (drums, vocals) and Seth Morrison (lead guitar). The band has released ten albums, with two, ''[[Collide (Skillet album)|Collide]]'' and ''[[Comatose (album)|Comatose]]'', receiving [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations.<ref name=\"2007 grammy nomination\">[http://www.ccmmagazine.com/news/headlines/11561322/ CCMMagazine.com: Skillet Closes Out 2007 With Grammy Nomination] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218133142/http://www.ccmmagazine.com/news/headlines/11561322/ |date=December 18, 2007 }}.

They are known for a relentless touring schedule, which garnered them a top five ranking in the Hardest Working Bands of 2010 by Songkick.com.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/news/2011/05/24.Skillet%20Scores%20First%20Billboard%20Music%20Award%20for%20Top%20Christian%20Album%20with%20Gold%20Certified%20AWAKE.asp |title=Music News, May 2011: Skillet Scores First Billboard Music Award for \"Top Christian Album\" with Gold \u2013 Certified AWAKE |date=May 24, 2011 |publisher=Jesusfreakhideout.com |access-date=March 23, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Band history ==\n=== Self-titled and ''Hey You, I Love Your Soul'' (1996\u201399) ===\nSkillet formed in 1996 with two members: [[John Cooper (musician)|John Cooper]], former vocalist for Tennessee progressive rock band Seraph, and [[Ken Steorts]], former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but they disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side-project.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16a1p_gN0WA |title=Skillet \u2013 \"Alien Youth\" Album EPK |publisher=YouTube |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref> They decided to name the experiment 'Skillet'. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label [[ForeFront Records]]. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut ''[[Skillet (album)|Skillet]]''. It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States.\n\nCooper has said the band's name was meant to be humorous, as the other founding members had already been in other bands, each with a different sound and style. The pastor of Covenant Community Church in Memphis\u2013where the band was formed as a worship band side project\u2013gave them their name as he felt they were like \"southern cooking, where you just toss a bunch of different things into a big ol' skillet and see what it turns out like.\"<ref name=\"EofCCM\">{{Cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark Allan |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/832 |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers |year=2002 |isbn=1-56563-679-1 |location=Peabody, Massachusetts |page=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/832 832]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/skillet-christian-rock-music-summer-concert |title=Christian rock band 'Skillet' explains how it got its name |last=Parke |first=Caleb |date=July 26, 2019 |website=Fox News}}</ref>\n\nSkillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled ''[[Hey You, I Love Your Soul]]'', which was released in April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band's first release. With this release, Skillet abandoned their post-grunge approach for a lighter alternative rock and style. Cooper's wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate his performance duties.\n\n=== ''Invincible'', ''Ardent Worship'', and ''Alien Youth'' (2000\u201302) ===\nShortly before the band began recording for their third album, ''[[Invincible (Skillet album)|Invincible]]'', Steorts left to be with his family and launch [[Visible School|Visible Music College]], a modern music ministry college located in Memphis, and Kevin Haaland joined the band as their new guitarist.  Korey Cooper joined the band permanently and played keyboards for the recording of ''Invincible''.  Because of this change, the musical style on ''Invincible'' changed to a more electronic sound.<ref name=\"Phantom Tollbooth\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.tollbooth.org/2001/reviews/skillet.html |title=Skillet \u2013 a Review of The Phantom Tollbooth |last=Shari Lloyd |publisher=Tollbooth.org |access-date=September 6, 2011}}</ref> Soon after the release of ''Invincible'' in early 2000, Trey McClurkin parted ways with Skillet, and Lori Peters filled the drummer's position.\n\nThe band released their first worship album and fourth album overall, ''[[Ardent Worship]]'', in late 2000. The band kept much of their sound from ''Invincible'' on their next album ''[[Alien Youth]]''.<ref name=\"Phantom Tollbooth\" /> With little time between touring and recording, Skillet released ''Alien Youth'' on August 28, 2001, which was the first album that John Cooper took on production duties. Before the release of ''Alien Youth'', Haaland left the band, and Ben Kasica took over on guitar.\n\n=== ''Collide'' (2003\u201305) ===\nIn 2003, ''[[Collide (Skillet album)|Collide]]'', the band's fifth studio album, was released by [[Ardent Records]] and contained the singles \"[[Savior (Skillet song)|Savior]]\" and \"Collide\". In 2004, the rights to ''Collide'' were bought by [[Lava Records]], an imprint of [[Atlantic Records]]. On May 25, 2004, ''Collide'' was re-released by Lava Records, with \"Open Wounds\" as an added track. The album was nominated for \"Best Rock Gospel Album\" in 2005.\n\nCiting [[P.O.D.]] as inspiration for the musical shift on ''Collide'', Cooper said, \"Well I'm one of these song writers, everything I hear goes through my John Cooper filter of what I like and what I don't like. [...] All these things [...] have been an influence on me.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicfaith.com/Interviews/10 |title=Interview at MusicFaith |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201180027/http://www.musicfaith.com/Interviews/10 |archive-date=December 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Comatose'' (2006\u201308) ===\nSkillet's album ''[[Comatose (album)|Comatose]]'' was released on October 3, 2006.

Vienna, 1902.</ref>\n\nAs [[rabbinic literature]] always contrasts the school of [[Hillel the Elder]] to that of [[Shammai]] and only presents the collective opinions of each of these opposing schools of thought without mentioning the individual nuances and opinions of the rabbis within them, these texts do not portray Gamaliel as being knowledgeable about the Jewish scriptures, nor do they portray him as a teacher.<ref name=JE /> For this reason, Gamaliel is not listed as part of the chain of individuals who perpetuated the Mishnaic tradition.<ref>''[[Pirkei Abot]]'' 1\u20132</ref> Instead the chain is listed as passing directly from Hillel to [[Yohanan ben Zakkai]].\n\nNevertheless, the Mishnah mentions Gamaliel's authorship of a few laws on the subjects of community welfare and conjugal rights. He argued that the law should protect women during divorce, and that, for the purpose of remarriage, a single witness was sufficient evidence for the death of a husband.<ref>''[[Yevamot]]'' 16:7</ref>\n\nVarious pieces of classical rabbinic literature additionally mention that Gamaliel sent out three [[epistle]]s, designed as notifications of new religious rulings, and which portray Gamaliel as the head of the Jewish body for religious law.<ref>[[Tosefta]] ''[[Sanhedrin (Talmud)|Sanhedrin]]'' 2:6; ''Sanhedrin'' 11b; [[Jerusalem Talmud]] ''Sanhedrin'' 18d; Jerusalem Talmud ''[[Ma'aser Sheni]]'' 56c</ref> Two of these three were sent, respectively, to the inhabitants of [[Galilee]] and \"the Darom\" (southern Judea), and were on the subject of the [[first tithe]]. The third epistle was sent to the [[Jewish diaspora|Jews of the diaspora]], and argued for the introduction of an [[intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary month]].\n\n[[Image:Plum\u00e9liau (56) Chapelle Saint-Nicod\u00e8me Retable de la Descente de Croix 20.JPG|thumb|widthpx|Statue of Gamaliel in (Chapelle Saint-Nicod\u00e8me de Plum\u00e9liau).]]\nSince the Hillel school of thought is presented collectively, there are very few other teachings which are clearly identifiable as Gamaliel's. There is only a somewhat cryptic dictum, comparing his students to classes of fish:\n\n:A [[kosher animals|ritually impure fish]]: one who has memorised everything by study, but has no understanding, and is the son of poor parents\n:A ritually pure fish: one who has learnt and understood everything, and is the son of rich parents\n:A fish from the [[Jordan River]]: one who has learnt everything, but doesn't know how to respond\n:A fish from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]: one who has learnt everything, and knows how to respond\n\nIn some manuscripts of [[Dunash ibn Tamim]]'s tenth-century Hebrew commentary on the ''[[Sefer Yetzirah]]'', the author identifies Gamaliel with the physician [[Galen]]. He claims to have seen an Arabic medical work translated from Hebrew entitled ''The Book of Gamaliel the Prince (Nasi), called Galenos among the Greeks''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gero |first1=Stephen |title=Galen on the Christians: A Reappraisal of the Arabic Evidence |journal=Orientalia Christiana Periodica |date=1990 |volume=56 |issue=2 |page=393}}</ref> However, since Galen lived in the second century and Gamaliel died during the mid-first century, this is unlikely.\n===Quotes===\n{{quote|Provide yourself with a [[rabbi]], and eschew doubtful matters, and tithe not overmuch by guesswork.<ref>{{cite book |last=editors |first=editors |title=Six Orders of the Mishnah (Pir\u1e33e Avot 1:16) |publisher=Eshkol |location=Jerusalem  |year=1978}}</ref><ref>The Living Talmud - The Wisdom of the Fathers, ed.

In the larger context (vs.{{bibleref2|Acts|5:17\u201342|9|17\u201342}}), [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and the other [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]] are described as being prosecuted before the Sanhedrin for continuing to preach the [[gospel]] despite the Jewish authorities having previously prohibited it. The passage describes Gamaliel as presenting an argument against killing the apostles, reminding them about the previous revolts of [[Theudas]] and [[Judas of Galilee]], which had collapsed quickly after the deaths of those individuals. Gamaliel's advice was accepted after his concluding argument:\n\n:\"And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.\" \u2014{{bibleref2|Acts|5:38\u201339|9|Acts 5:38\u201339}}\n\nThe Book of Acts later goes on to describe [[Paul the Apostle]] recounting that although \"born in Tarsus\", he was brought up in Jerusalem \"at the feet of Gamaliel, ''[and]'' taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers\" ({{bibleref|Acts|22:3|9}}). No details are given about which teachings Paul adopted from Gamaliel, as it is assumed that as a Pharisee, Paul was already recognized in the community at that time as a devout Jew. Also, how much Gamaliel influenced aspects of Christianity is unmentioned. However, there is no other record of Gamaliel ever having taught in public,<ref name=JE /> but the Talmud does describe Gamaliel as teaching a student who displayed \"impudence in learning\", which a few scholars identify as a possible reference to Paul.<ref>''Shabbat 30b</ref> {{Citation needed|reason=what scholars|date=February 2019}} The relationship of [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism]] continues to be the subject of scholarly debate. [[Helmut Koester]], Professor of Divinity and of Ecclesiastical History at [[Harvard University]], questions if Paul studied under this famous rabbi, arguing that there is a marked contrast in the tolerance that Gamaliel is said to have expressed about Christianity with the [[Persecution of early Christians by the Jews|\"murderous rage\" against Christians]] that Paul is described as having prior to his conversion ({{bibleref2|Acts|8:1\u20133|9|Acts 8:1\u20133}}).{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn the apocryphal ''Gospel of Gamaliel'', he figures as a witness to the raising of a dead man at Jesus' tomb.<ref>G\u00fcnter Stemberger, ''Jews and Christians in The Holy Land: Palestine in The Fourth Century'', pages 110\u2013111 (Edinburgh: T & T Clark, 2000. {{ISBN|0-567-08699-2}}); citing M.-A. van den Oudenrijn, ''Gamaliel: Athiopische Texte zur Pilatusliteratur'' (Freiburg, 1959).</ref>\n\n===Veneration===\n[[File:Stephengamalielnicodemus.jpg|thumb|350px|''Saint Stephen Mourned by Saints Gamaliel and Nicodemus'', follower of Carlo Saraceni, c. 1615, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]\nEcclesiastical tradition maintains that Gamaliel had embraced the [[Christianity|Christian faith]] and his tolerant attitude toward [[early Christianity|early Christians]] is explained by this.

Combs, writing in 1891, complained about show wins awarded to puppies, when the dog's coat does not fully come in until three or four years old, \"and the honour of winning such a prize (for a puppy) can therefore be of but little practical benefit to the owner\" since the adult dog's colour cannot be exactly predicted.<ref>The American book of the Dog, edited by G.

For shows, the coat is left long, and may be trimmed to floor length to give ease of movement and a neater appearance. Hair on the feet and the tips of ears can also be trimmed.<ref name=\"AKCstandard\" /><ref name=\"KCstandard\" /> The traditional long coat is extremely high maintenance. The coat might get knotted if not brushed daily. In order to prevent breakage, the coat may be wrapped in [[rice paper]], [[tissue paper]] or plastic, after a light oiling with a coat oil. The oil has to be washed out once a month and the wraps must be fixed periodically during the week to prevent them from sliding down and breaking the hair. Elaborate coat care dates from the earliest days of the breed. In 1878, John Walsh described similar preparations: the coat is \"well greased\" with [[coconut oil]], the dog is bathed weekly, and the dog's feet are \"carefully kept in stockings\".<ref>The Dogs of the British Islands, pg 212, by John Henry Walsh, The Filed publisher, 1878, Third Edition</ref>\n\n==Temperament==\n[[File:Henri the yorki from alabama .jpg|alt=|thumb|The Yorkshire Terrier character is described as \"conveying an important air\". According to the standard, the dog's high head carriage and confident manner should give the appearance of vigor and self-importance.]]\nThe ideal Yorkshire Terrier character or \"personality\" is described with a \"carriage very upright feisty\" and \"conveying an important air\".<ref name=\"KCstandard\" /> Though small, the Yorkshire Terrier is active, very protective, curious, and fond of attention.  Mentally sound and emotionally secure ones should normally not show the soft submissive temperament seen in [[lap dog]]s, although many exhibit this behaviour due to improper training.  Because of this, it is advised that a Yorkie would not be suitable for a home with typical young children. Instead, they make ideal companions for older families with many more reputable breeders routinely only homing to families with children older than about 10 years for the comfort of the dog, but more so for the benefit of the child.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://doglime.com/yorkshire-terrier/|title=Is Yorkshire Terrier Child-Friendly?|date=June 16, 2019|publisher=Doglime}}</ref>\n\nYorkshire Terriers are an easy dog breed to train. This results from their own nature to work without human assistance. They are naturally smart and quick to learn with many being food- and or praise-motivated.  Because they were developed as a working breed, many need a lot of both physical and mental stimulation\u2014with both long walks/runs but also indoor games and training to keep their mind busy. They are known for being yappy, but many have reported that a contented Yorkie is a quiet one\u2014that will happily curl up on your knee in the evening. But they are all individuals, with some being much more laid back than others, and the breeder should ideally be able to advise on the needs and temperaments of their particular line. Yorkies are easily adaptable to all surroundings, travel well, and make suitable pets for many homes. Due to their small size, they require limited exercise but need daily interaction with people. They thrive on attention and love. Many are more timid around other dogs and prefer to stay close to their humans for comfort.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Yorkshire Terrier\"/>\n\nYorkshire Terriers do tend to [[Bark (sound)|bark]] a lot. This makes them excellent watchdogs, as they will sound the alarm when anyone gets close. A barking problem can often be resolved with proper training and exercise.\n\nYorkshire Terriers are ranked 34th in [[Stanley Coren]]'s ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coren|first=Stanley|title=The Intelligence of Dogs |year=2006|publisher=Pocket Books|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-4165-0287-6}}</ref>\n\n==Health==\nHealth issues often seen in the Yorkshire Terrier include [[bronchitis]], [[lymphangiectasia]], [[portosystemic shunt]], [[cataract]]s, and [[Keratoconjunctivitis sicca|keratitis sicca]].<ref name=Lane>Lane, Marion (2001).

In addition, allergies can cause skin to be dry, itchy and/or red.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yorkie Skin Problems|url=http://www.yorkieinfocenter.com/Yorkie_Skin_Problems.html|publisher=yorkieinfocenter.com|accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Life expectancy|lifespan]] of a Yorkie is 13\u201320 years.<ref name=Shultz/><ref name=\"doi10.1016.2Fj.tvjl.2013.09.020\"/> Undersized Yorkies (under {{cvt|3|lb|disp=or||abbr=}}) generally have a shorter life span, as they are especially prone to health problems such as chronic [[diarrhoea]] and [[vomiting]]; are more sensitive to anaesthesia; and are more easily injured.<ref name=Shultz/>\n\n===Teeth===\n[[File:Morkie puppy retained teeth.jpg|thumb|A Morkie (half Maltese, half Yorkshire Terrier) puppy with his deciduous teeth and adult teeth growing in]]\nAs with all other dogs, Yorkies have two sets of teeth in their life. The first set of teeth is the 28-piece [[deciduous teeth]] (often referred to as \"milk teeth\", \"baby teeth\", or \"puppy teeth\"). The second set is the 42-piece permanent or adult teeth. Sometimes the number of permanent or adult teeth may vary, which is fine as long as they do not cause bad bite. When puppies are born, they have no teeth because milk is the only food they need. The deciduous teeth will grow from the age of 3 to 8 weeks old, in the order of [[Incisor|incisors]], [[Canine tooth|canines]], and [[Premolar|premolars]]. Yorkie puppies have no [[Molar (tooth)|molar teeth]]. Yorkie puppies will start to lose their deciduous or baby teeth when the permanent or adult teeth come in. The permanent or adult grow when the Yorkie puppies are 4 to 8 months old. By around 8 months old, those teeth should fully develop. The permanent or adult teeth will grow in the order of incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Molar teeth will develop at around 6 to 8 months old.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Sock|title=When Do Yorkie Puppies Lose Their Teeth?|url=http://yorkiepuppies.org.uk/when-do-yorkie-puppies-lose-their-teeth.html|publisher=Sock Nye|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nYorkies and other small dog breeds may have problems if the deciduous or baby teeth do not fall out as the permanent or adult teeth grow. This is caused by the new teeth not growing right underneath the deciduous teeth. (Usually, a puppy's body will absorb the roots of puppy teeth.) If the puppy tooth does not yield to the incoming tooth, it should be removed because it can cause a [[malocclusion]] or bad bite.<ref>{{cite web|last=Van Dalsum|first=Jeff|title=Different Stages of Puppy Dental Development|url=http://perfectpuppycare.com/different-stages-of-puppy-dental-development|publisher=Jeff Van Dalsum|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>  Retained teeth can cause [[tooth decay]] because food can be easily caught in between the deciduous and permanent teeth. Sometimes the new teeth are forced to grow into an abnormal position and further cause a bad bite. The retained teeth may stay or fall weeks after the new teeth have developed. When necessary, the retained deciduous or baby teeth need to be removed surgically.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Sock|title=Retained Deciduous or Baby Teeth|url=http://yorkiepuppies.org.uk/retained-deciduous-or-baby-teeth.html|publisher=Sock Nye|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Yorkie's Retained Deciduous or Baby Fangs.jpg|thumb|A Yorkshire Terrier's retained deciduous or baby fangs]]\n\nLike other small breeds, Yorkies are also prone to severe dental disease. Because they have a small jaw, their teeth can become crowded and may not fall out naturally. This can cause food and plaque to build up, and bacteria can eventually develop on the surface of the teeth, leading to [[periodontal disease]]. In addition, the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body and cause heart and kidney problems. The best prevention is regular brushing of the teeth with a toothpaste formulated specifically for dogs. Human toothpaste is not recommended, because it foams more easily and may be swallowed. Professional teeth cleaning by a veterinarian may also be required to prevent the development of dental problems.<ref name=Teeth>{{cite web|title=Caring For Your Yorkshire Terrier: Common Health Problems |url =http://www.essortment.com/caring-yorkshire-terrier-common-health-problems-63025.html | accessdate =13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Genetic defects===\nCertain [[genetic disorder]]s can be found in Yorkshire Terriers, including [[distichia]]sis, [[hydrocephalus]], [[hypoplasia of dens]], [[Legg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes syndrome]], [[luxating patella]], [[portosystemic shunt]], [[retinal dysplasia]], [[tracheal collapse]], and [[Bladder stone (animal)|bladder stone]]s.<ref name=KSU>{{cite web|title=Hereditary and Congenital Diseases of Purebred Dogs |publisher=Kansas State University |url=http://www.vet.ksu.edu/studentorgs/Therio/pdf/Hereditary_Congenital.pdf |accessdate=13 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221132319/http://www.vet.ksu.edu/studentorgs/Therio/pdf/Hereditary_Congenital.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2007 }}</ref>  The following are among the most common [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] [[Genetic disorder|defects]] that affect Yorkie's:\n\n* [[Distichia]]e, [[eyelash]]es arising from an abnormal spot (usually the duct of the [[meibomian gland]] at the edge of the eyelid), are often found in Yorkies.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|last=Schultz |first=Jacque Lynn |title=The Terrier Tyke With a Big Attitude |publisher=ASPCA |year=2004 |url=http://www.petfinder.com/journalindex.cgi?path=/public/breeds/dogbreeds/1.4.28.txt&template=templateprint.html |accessdate=10 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230234816/http://www.petfinder.com/journalindex.cgi?path=/public/breeds/dogbreeds/1.4.28.txt&template=templateprint.html |archivedate=30 December 2004 }}</ref>  Distichiae can irritate the eye and cause tearing, squinting, inflammation, [[corneal abrasion]]s or [[Corneal ulcers in animals|corneal ulcers]], and scarring.

The severity of luxating patellas are on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 being the most severe. Many dogs will not develop past a stage 1 or 2.  \n* [[Portosystemic shunt]], a congenital malformation of the [[Hepatic portal vein|portal vein]] (which brings blood to the [[liver]] for cleansing), is also common in Yorkies. In this condition some of the dog's blood bypasses the liver and the \"dirty\" blood goes on to poison the heart, brain, lungs and other [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] with toxins. A Yorkie with this condition might exhibit a wide variety of symptoms, such as small stature, poor appetite, weak muscle development, decreased ability to learn, inferior coordination, occasional vomiting and diarrhoea, [[Abnormality (behavior)|behavioral abnormalities]], seizures (especially after a meal) and [[blindness]], which could lead to a coma and death.

The final colour is usually a black or greyish colour.<ref name=\"YTCA\" /> P. H. Combs, writing in 1891, complained about show wins awarded to puppies, when the dog's coat does not fully come in until three or four years old, \"and the honour of winning such a prize (for a puppy) can therefore be of but little practical benefit to the owner\" since the adult dog's colour cannot be exactly predicted.<ref>The American book of the Dog, edited by G.

For shows, the coat is left long, and may be trimmed to floor length to give ease of movement and a neater appearance. Hair on the feet and the tips of ears can also be trimmed.<ref name=\"AKCstandard\" /><ref name=\"KCstandard\" /> The traditional long coat is extremely high maintenance. The coat might get knotted if not brushed daily. In order to prevent breakage, the coat may be wrapped in [[rice paper]], [[tissue paper]] or plastic, after a light oiling with a coat oil. The oil has to be washed out once a month and the wraps must be fixed periodically during the week to prevent them from sliding down and breaking the hair. Elaborate coat care dates from the earliest days of the breed. In 1878, John Walsh described similar preparations: the coat is \"well greased\" with [[coconut oil]], the dog is bathed weekly, and the dog's feet are \"carefully kept in stockings\".<ref>The Dogs of the British Islands, pg 212, by John Henry Walsh, The Filed publisher, 1878, Third Edition</ref>\n\n==Temperament==\n[[File:Henri the yorki from alabama .jpg|alt=|thumb|The Yorkshire Terrier character is described as \"conveying an important air\". According to the standard, the dog's high head carriage and confident manner should give the appearance of vigor and self-importance.]]\nThe ideal Yorkshire Terrier character or \"personality\" is described with a \"carriage very upright feisty\" and \"conveying an important air\".<ref name=\"KCstandard\" /> Though small, the Yorkshire Terrier is active, very protective, curious, and fond of attention.  Mentally sound and emotionally secure ones should normally not show the soft submissive temperament seen in [[lap dog]]s, although many exhibit this behaviour due to improper training.  Because of this, it is advised that a Yorkie would not be suitable for a home with typical young children. Instead, they make ideal companions for older families with many more reputable breeders routinely only homing to families with children older than about 10 years for the comfort of the dog, but more so for the benefit of the child.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://doglime.com/yorkshire-terrier/|title=Is Yorkshire Terrier Child-Friendly?|date=June 16, 2019|publisher=Doglime}}</ref>\n\nYorkshire Terriers are an easy dog breed to train. This results from their own nature to work without human assistance. They are naturally smart and quick to learn with many being food- and or praise-motivated.  Because they were developed as a working breed, many need a lot of both physical and mental stimulation\u2014with both long walks/runs but also indoor games and training to keep their mind busy. They are known for being yappy, but many have reported that a contented Yorkie is a quiet one\u2014that will happily curl up on your knee in the evening. But they are all individuals, with some being much more laid back than others, and the breeder should ideally be able to advise on the needs and temperaments of their particular line. Yorkies are easily adaptable to all surroundings, travel well, and make suitable pets for many homes. Due to their small size, they require limited exercise but need daily interaction with people. They thrive on attention and love. Many are more timid around other dogs and prefer to stay close to their humans for comfort.<ref name=\"Get to Know the Yorkshire Terrier\"/>\n\nYorkshire Terriers do tend to [[Bark (sound)|bark]] a lot. This makes them excellent watchdogs, as they will sound the alarm when anyone gets close. A barking problem can often be resolved with proper training and exercise.\n\nYorkshire Terriers are ranked 34th in [[Stanley Coren]]'s ''[[The Intelligence of Dogs]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coren|first=Stanley|title=The Intelligence of Dogs |year=2006|publisher=Pocket Books|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-4165-0287-6}}</ref>\n\n==Health==\nHealth issues often seen in the Yorkshire Terrier include [[bronchitis]], [[lymphangiectasia]], [[portosystemic shunt]], [[cataract]]s, and [[Keratoconjunctivitis sicca|keratitis sicca]].<ref name=Lane>Lane, Marion (2001).

The first set of teeth is the 28-piece [[deciduous teeth]] (often referred to as \"milk teeth\", \"baby teeth\", or \"puppy teeth\"). The second set is the 42-piece permanent or adult teeth. Sometimes the number of permanent or adult teeth may vary, which is fine as long as they do not cause bad bite. When puppies are born, they have no teeth because milk is the only food they need. The deciduous teeth will grow from the age of 3 to 8 weeks old, in the order of [[Incisor|incisors]], [[Canine tooth|canines]], and [[Premolar|premolars]]. Yorkie puppies have no [[Molar (tooth)|molar teeth]]. Yorkie puppies will start to lose their deciduous or baby teeth when the permanent or adult teeth come in. The permanent or adult grow when the Yorkie puppies are 4 to 8 months old. By around 8 months old, those teeth should fully develop. The permanent or adult teeth will grow in the order of incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Molar teeth will develop at around 6 to 8 months old.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Sock|title=When Do Yorkie Puppies Lose Their Teeth?|url=http://yorkiepuppies.org.uk/when-do-yorkie-puppies-lose-their-teeth.html|publisher=Sock Nye|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nYorkies and other small dog breeds may have problems if the deciduous or baby teeth do not fall out as the permanent or adult teeth grow. This is caused by the new teeth not growing right underneath the deciduous teeth. (Usually, a puppy's body will absorb the roots of puppy teeth.) If the puppy tooth does not yield to the incoming tooth, it should be removed because it can cause a [[malocclusion]] or bad bite.<ref>{{cite web|last=Van Dalsum|first=Jeff|title=Different Stages of Puppy Dental Development|url=http://perfectpuppycare.com/different-stages-of-puppy-dental-development|publisher=Jeff Van Dalsum|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>  Retained teeth can cause [[tooth decay]] because food can be easily caught in between the deciduous and permanent teeth. Sometimes the new teeth are forced to grow into an abnormal position and further cause a bad bite. The retained teeth may stay or fall weeks after the new teeth have developed. When necessary, the retained deciduous or baby teeth need to be removed surgically.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nye|first=Sock|title=Retained Deciduous or Baby Teeth|url=http://yorkiepuppies.org.uk/retained-deciduous-or-baby-teeth.html|publisher=Sock Nye|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Yorkie's Retained Deciduous or Baby Fangs.jpg|thumb|A Yorkshire Terrier's retained deciduous or baby fangs]]\n\nLike other small breeds, Yorkies are also prone to severe dental disease. Because they have a small jaw, their teeth can become crowded and may not fall out naturally. This can cause food and plaque to build up, and bacteria can eventually develop on the surface of the teeth, leading to [[periodontal disease]]. In addition, the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body and cause heart and kidney problems. The best prevention is regular brushing of the teeth with a toothpaste formulated specifically for dogs. Human toothpaste is not recommended, because it foams more easily and may be swallowed. Professional teeth cleaning by a veterinarian may also be required to prevent the development of dental problems.<ref name=Teeth>{{cite web|title=Caring For Your Yorkshire Terrier: Common Health Problems |url =http://www.essortment.com/caring-yorkshire-terrier-common-health-problems-63025.html | accessdate =13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Genetic defects===\nCertain [[genetic disorder]]s can be found in Yorkshire Terriers, including [[distichia]]sis, [[hydrocephalus]], [[hypoplasia of dens]], [[Legg\u2013Calv\u00e9\u2013Perthes syndrome]], [[luxating patella]], [[portosystemic shunt]], [[retinal dysplasia]], [[tracheal collapse]], and [[Bladder stone (animal)|bladder stone]]s.<ref name=KSU>{{cite web|title=Hereditary and Congenital Diseases of Purebred Dogs |publisher=Kansas State University |url=http://www.vet.ksu.edu/studentorgs/Therio/pdf/Hereditary_Congenital.pdf |accessdate=13 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221132319/http://www.vet.ksu.edu/studentorgs/Therio/pdf/Hereditary_Congenital.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2007 }}</ref>  The following are among the most common [[Congenital disorder|congenital]] [[Genetic disorder|defects]] that affect Yorkie's:\n\n* [[Distichia]]e, [[eyelash]]es arising from an abnormal spot (usually the duct of the [[meibomian gland]] at the edge of the eyelid), are often found in Yorkies.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|last=Schultz |first=Jacque Lynn |title=The Terrier Tyke With a Big Attitude |publisher=ASPCA |year=2004 |url=http://www.petfinder.com/journalindex.cgi?path=/public/breeds/dogbreeds/1.4.28.txt&template=templateprint.html |accessdate=10 March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041230234816/http://www.petfinder.com/journalindex.cgi?path=/public/breeds/dogbreeds/1.4.28.txt&template=templateprint.html |archivedate=30 December 2004 }}</ref>  Distichiae can irritate the eye and cause tearing, squinting, inflammation, [[corneal abrasion]]s or [[Corneal ulcers in animals|corneal ulcers]], and scarring.

Creative Computers was launched from the founders\u2019 residence in [[Marina Del Rey, CA]].  The company was set up as a [[mail order catalog]] company whereby products are advertised through paper flyers/catalogs.  Interested customers called in their orders through the provided toll-free \"1-800\" phone number.<ref>{{cite web | author = Manta | title = Creative Computers: Company Profile | url=http://www.manta.com/c/mmft4c8/creative-computers | access-date = 1 November 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The founders then took the order and placed purchase orders to acquire sold products, bill the customers\u2019 credit card and ship the products to the customers.  At startup, the company's catalog consisted of only [[Amiga|Amiga computers]] made by [[Commodore International]].  The company became the number one mail order reseller of Amiga computers.  In 1993/1994 Commodore went through financial difficulties, which caused it to close its operation in April 1994.\n\nIn early 1994, PC Mall obtained authorization to sell [[Apple computers]] through its mail order catalog model.  The authorization came at an opportune time as the Commodore operation was soon to close.  With the Apple authorization and the anticipated growth, PC Mall moved its operation from the back of a [[retail]] store to a call center with over 100 seats, a {{convert|35000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] center, and over {{convert|15000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} of corporate office space.\n\nIn first quarter of 1995, the company filed for its initial public offering and went public in April 1995.\n\nIn January 2000, Creative Computers change its name to '''IdeaMall, Inc.'''<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=82444&p=irol-newsArticle_pf&ID=70567|title=Creative Computers, Inc., to be Renamed IdeaMall; Intensifying Focus on Internet and Business-to-Business Opportunities|date=2000-01-25|publisher=Creative Computers|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The following year, the company changed its name again to '''PC Mall, Inc.'''<ref name=\"bw-2001apr12\">{{cite press release|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/IdeaMall,+Inc.+Announces+Name+Change+to+PC+Mall,+Inc.%3B+Name+Change...-a073107049|title=IdeaMall, Inc.

In addition to the millions of catalogs mailed monthly, the company launched its first web sites ''macmall.com'' and ''pcmall.com'' in 1996.\n\nIn 1996\u20131997, the company acquired Computability, a [[Milwaukee]]-based company,<ref>{{cite news|last=Bergquist|first=Lee|title=ComputAbility to be Sold|page=D2|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|date=1997-08-27|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RLIeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KS4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6114,7590142&dq=computability+milwaukee&hl=en|access-date=2010-10-25|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730131919/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RLIeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KS4EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6114,7590142&dq=computability+milwaukee&hl=en|archive-date=2016-07-30|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and Elek-Tek, a [[Chicago]]-based company, both dealing primarily with PC Wintel products.\n\nIn 2001, the company acquired Wareforce, a southern California-based company.

Both DSW and NSPI's operations are now secured under the SARCOM subsidiary.\n\nVenturing into the realm of social networking for the first time, the company launched its Small Business Network, or SBN, in 2009.

The city's industry historically was centered on the sale and processing of tobacco, but today the major industries are health care, education and manufacturing. The largest employer is Vidant (formerly Pitt Memorial Hospital) and the second largest is East Carolina University with specialized manufacturing and scientific industries augmenting the employment portfolio. Vidant Health is also home to the robotic heart surgery training center founded by Dr. Randolph Chitwood who holds several patents related to the daVinci surgical robot.\n\n==Religion==\nAs with most of North Carolina, Greenville is predominately [[Protestant Christian]], with large concentrations of [[Baptists]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], [[Methodists]], and various other [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] groups. [[Presbyterians]], and [[Disciples of Christ]], also constitute a significant portion of the population.  There is also a small Quaker meeting.\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] community in Greenville has seen steady growth over the years with the migration of [[Hispanic]] workers to the area along with significant numbers of people from the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern United States who work for [[East Carolina University]], the [[Vidant Health]], and other employers. There are two primary Catholic Parishes in Greenville including St. Gabriel of the Sorrowful Mother on Dickinson Avenue and St. Peter Catholic Church on East 4th Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dioceseofraleigh.org/about/diocese|title=The Diocese|website=Diocese of Raleigh|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> St. Gabriel's serves hundreds of Spanish speaking families and supports a Head Start program in the West Greenville area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stgabrielgreenville.org/about|title=St. Gabriel's Catholic Church - Greenville, NC: About|website=www.stgabrielgreenville.org|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> St. Peter's Catholic Church in Greenville supports a day school for grades K-8.

It is an \"Alive-At-Five\" style pep-rally with live music, ECU cheerleaders, exhibits, children's activities, food samplings, and a beer and wine garden. The Downtown area is known for its large annual Halloween street party and live music bars. Considering the size of the city, Greenville as a large number of bars and nightclubs located downtown, due in large part to the location of ECU's campus which is immediately adjacent to downtown.

Greenville Little Leagues was founded in 1951 and has two leagues; North State and Tar Heel. In 1998, a team from Greenville represented the South Region in the Little League World Series. They made it to the semi-finals, where they lost to eventual champion, Toms River, New Jersey. In 2017, Greenville again represented the Southeast region in the Little League World Series.
