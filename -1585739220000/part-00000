Such an order may be issued by public authorities but also by the owner of a house to those living in the household. For instance, an [[au pair]] is typically given a curfew, which regulates when they must return to the host family's home in the evening.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"curfew\" comes from the [[Old French]] phrase \"''couvre-feu''\", which means \"cover fire\". It was later adopted into [[Middle English]]  as \"curfeu\", which later became the modern \"curfew\".<ref>{{OED|curfew}}</ref> Its original meaning refers to a law made by [[William The Conqueror]] that all lights and fires should be covered at the ringing of an eight o'clock bell to prevent the spread of destructive fire within communities in timber buildings.<ref>''Bailey's Dictionary'', fifth edition 1731</ref>\n\n==Types==\n# An order issued by the public authorities or military forces requiring everyone or certain people to be indoors at certain times, often at night. It can be imposed to maintain public order (such as those after the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], the [[2005 civil unrest in France]], the [[2010 Chile earthquake]], the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], and the [[2014 Ferguson unrest]]), or suppress targeted groups. Curfews have long been directed at certain groups in many cities or states, such as [[Japanese-American]] university students on the [[West Coast of the United States]] during [[World War II]], [[African-American]]s in many towns during the time of [[Jim Crow laws]], or people younger than a certain age (usually within a few years either side of 18) in many towns of the [[United States]] since the 1980s; see below.\n# An order by the [[legal guardian]]s of a teenager to return home by a specific time, usually in the evening or night. This may apply daily, or vary with the day of the week, e.g., if the minor has to go to school the next day.\n# An order by the head of household to a domestic assistant such as an au pair or [[nanny]]. The domestic assistant must then return home by a specific time.\n# A daily requirement for guests to return to their [[hostel]] before a specified time, usually in the evening or night.\n# In [[baseball]], a time after which a game must end, or play be suspended. For example, in the [[American League]] the curfew rule for many years decreed that no [[innings|inning]] could begin after 1 am local time (with the exception of international games).\n# In aeronautics, [[night flying restrictions]] may restrict aircraft operations over a defined period in the nighttime, to limit the disruption of [[aircraft noise]] on the sleep of nearby residents. Notable examples are the [[London]] airports of [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]], which operate under the [[Quota Count system]].\n# In a few locations in the UK patrons of licensed premises may not enter after a \"curfew\" time, also known as \"last orders\". In [[Inverclyde]] for example this is currently set at 12:00 am.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/greenock/articles/2010/02/26/397551-pub-and-club-curfew-extended|title=Pub and club curfew extended|work=Greenock Telegraph}}</ref>\n\n== By country ==\n[[Image:Curfew in Tel Aviv H ih 039.JPG|thumb|[[Mandatory Palestine|British]] paratroopers enforce curfew in [[Tel Aviv]] after [[King David Hotel bombing]], July 1946.

During the period 1 May to 1 September, children may be outdoors for two hours longer.\n\nChildren and teenagers that break curfew are taken to the local police station and police officers inform their parents to get them. The age limits stated here shall be based upon year of birth, not date of birth. If a parent cannot be reached, the child or teenager is taken to a shelter.\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nIn [[Sri Lanka]], the [[Sri Lanka Police]] are empowered to declare and enforce a ''Police Curfew'' in any [[police station|police area]] for any particular period to maintain the peace, law and order under the ''Police Ordinance''. Under the [[State_of_emergency#Sri_Lanka|emergency regulations]] of the ''Public Security Ordinance'', the President may declare a curfew over the whole or over any part of the country. Travel is restricted, during a curfew, to authorised persons such as police, armed forces personal and public officers. Civilians may gain a [[Curfew Pass]] from a police station to travel during a curfew.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] 2003 Anti-Social Behaviour Act created zones that allow police from 9 PM to 6 AM to hold and escort home unaccompanied minors under the age of 16, whether badly behaved or not.

On appeal the court of appeal held that the act gave police powers to escort minors home only if they are involved in, or at risk from, actual or imminently anticipated bad behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/media/press/2006/court-judgment-on-governments-anti-yob-anti-child-policy.php|title=Court Judgment on Government\u2019s \u2018Anti-Yob\u2019/ Anti-Child Policy|work=liberty-human-rights.org.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn a few towns in the United Kingdom, the [[curfew bell]] is still rung as a continuation of the medieval tradition where the bell used to be rung from the [[parish church]] to guide travelers safely towards a town or village as darkness fell, or when bad weather made it difficult to follow trackways and for the villagers to extinguish their lights and fires as a safety measure to combat accidental fires. Until 1100 it was against the law to burn any lights after the ringing of the curfew bell. In Morpeth, the curfew is rung each night at 8pm from [[Morpeth Clock Tower]]. In [[Chertsey]], it is rung at 8pm, from [[Michaelmas]] to [[Lady Day]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stpeterschertsey.org.uk/bells/curfew.htm|title=St. Peter's Shared Church Chertsey|work=stpeterschertsey.org.uk}}</ref> A short story concerning the Chertsey curfew, set in 1471, and entitled \"[[Blanche Heriot]]. A legend of old [[Chertsey]] Church\" was published by Albert Richard Smith in 1843, and formed a basis for the poem \"[[Curfew Must Not Ring Tonight]]\".

However, none of these curfew bells serve their original function.\n\n===United States of America===\n\n====Juvenile curfews====\nCurfew law in the [[United States]] is usually a matter of [[local ordinance]] (mainly applied by a municipality or county), rather than federal law. However, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] guarantees certain rights, which have been applied to the states through the 14th Amendment. Hence, any curfew law may be overruled and struck down if, for example, it violates a juvenile's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st]], [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] or [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] rights.\nNonetheless, curfews are set by state and local governments. They vary by state<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://411newyork.org/guide/2009/08/14/curfews-in-new-york/|title=Curfews in New York \u00b7 411 NY|website=411newyork.org}}</ref> and even by county or municipality. In some cities, there are curfews for persons under the age of 18. American military curfews are a tool used by commanders at various installations to shape the behavior of soldiers.<ref>{{Citation|url= http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/korea/curfew-put-in-place-for-all-u-s-troops-in-south-korea-1.157192\n|title=Curfew put in place for all US troops in South Korea |publisher=Stars and Stripes|year=2011|accessdate=12 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe stated purpose of such laws is generally to deter disorderly behavior and crime, while others can include to protect youth from victimization and to strengthen parental responsibility,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecode360.com/14324463|title=Town of Myersville, MD Curfew|work=ecode360.com}}</ref> but their effectiveness is subject to debate. Generally, curfews attempt to address [[vandalism]], [[shooting]]s, and [[property crime]]s, which are believed to happen mostly at night, but are less commonly used to address [[Legal drinking age|underage drinking]], [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving]] and [[teenage pregnancy]]. Parents can be fined, [[criminal charge|charged]] or ordered to take parenting classes for willingly, or through insufficient control or supervision, permitting the child to violate the curfew.

Such an order may be issued by public authorities but also by the owner of a house to those living in the household. For instance, an [[au pair]] is typically given a curfew, which regulates when they must return to the host family's home in the evening.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"curfew\" comes from the [[Old French]] phrase \"''couvre-feu''\", which means \"cover fire\". It was later adopted into [[Middle English]]  as \"curfeu\", which later became the modern \"curfew\".<ref>{{OED|curfew}}</ref> Its original meaning refers to a law made by [[William The Conqueror]] that all lights and fires should be covered at the ringing of an eight o'clock bell to prevent the spread of destructive fire within communities in timber buildings.<ref>''Bailey's Dictionary'', fifth edition 1731</ref>\n\n==Types==\n# An order issued by the public authorities or military forces requiring everyone or certain people to be indoors at certain times, often at night. It can be imposed to maintain public order (such as those after the [[Northeast Blackout of 2003]], the [[2005 civil unrest in France]], the [[2010 Chile earthquake]], the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], and the [[2014 Ferguson unrest]]), or suppress targeted groups. Curfews have long been directed at certain groups in many cities or states, such as [[Japanese-American]] university students on the [[West Coast of the United States]] during [[World War II]], [[African-American]]s in many towns during the time of [[Jim Crow laws]], or people younger than a certain age (usually within a few years either side of 18) in many towns of the [[United States]] since the 1980s; see below.\n# An order by the [[legal guardian]]s of a teenager to return home by a specific time, usually in the evening or night. This may apply daily, or vary with the day of the week, e.g., if the minor has to go to school the next day.\n# An order by the head of household to a domestic assistant such as an au pair or [[nanny]]. The domestic assistant must then return home by a specific time.\n# A daily requirement for guests to return to their [[hostel]] before a specified time, usually in the evening or night.\n# In [[baseball]], a time after which a game must end, or play be suspended. For example, in the [[American League]] the curfew rule for many years decreed that no [[innings|inning]] could begin after 1 am local time (with the exception of international games).\n# In aeronautics, [[night flying restrictions]] may restrict aircraft operations over a defined period in the nighttime, to limit the disruption of [[aircraft noise]] on the sleep of nearby residents. Notable examples are the [[London]] airports of [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]], which operate under the [[Quota Count system]].\n# In a few locations in the UK patrons of licensed premises may not enter after a \"curfew\" time, also known as \"last orders\". In [[Inverclyde]] for example this is currently set at 12:00 am.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/greenock/articles/2010/02/26/397551-pub-and-club-curfew-extended|title=Pub and club curfew extended|work=Greenock Telegraph}}</ref>\n\n== By country ==\n[[Image:Curfew in Tel Aviv H ih 039.JPG|thumb|[[Mandatory Palestine|British]] paratroopers enforce curfew in [[Tel Aviv]] after [[King David Hotel bombing]], July 1946.

Until 1100 it was against the law to burn any lights after the ringing of the curfew bell. In Morpeth, the curfew is rung each night at 8pm from [[Morpeth Clock Tower]].

However, the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] guarantees certain rights, which have been applied to the states through the 14th Amendment. Hence, any curfew law may be overruled and struck down if, for example, it violates a juvenile's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st]], [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] or [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] rights.\nNonetheless, curfews are set by state and local governments.

As a result, Taobao became mainland China's undisputed market leader within two years. Its market share surged from 8% to 59% between 2003 and 2005, while eBay China plunged from 79% to 36%.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"China's pied piper\". The Economist.

Taobao Mall established itself as the destination for quality brand name goods for Chinese consumers. Taobao Mall launched an independent web domain, [[Tmall]].com, and enhanced its focus on product verticals and improvements in shopping experience in November 2010. It became an independent business in June 2011 and changed its Chinese name to Tian Mao ([[Tmall]]) in January 2012. As of October 2013 it was the eighth most visited web site in China.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alexa.com Tmall.com Access Statistics|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/tmall.com#trafficstats|work=Alexa.com|publisher=Alexa.com|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Taobao fueled the overall growth of the Chinese online shopping industry through execution of the \u201cBig Taobao\u201d strategy with the aim of becoming a provider of e-commerce infrastructure services for all e-commerce market participants.\n\nIn October 2010, Taobao beta launched eTao as an independent searching engine for online shopping, providing product and merchant information from a number of major consumer e-commerce websites in China. Online shoppers can use the site to compare prices from different sellers and identify products to buy. According to the Alibaba Group web site, eTao offers products from Amazon China, [[Dangdang]], Gome, Yihaodian, Nike China and Vancl, as well as Taobao and [[Tmall]].<ref name=\"Alibaba Group Company Overview\">{{cite web|title=Alibaba Group Company Overview|url=http://news.alibaba.com/specials/aboutalibaba/aligroup/index.html|work=Alibaba Group|publisher=Alibaba Group|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, Alibaba Group opened a retail store in Beijing under the Taobao Mall brand. The five-story 25,000sqm Taobao Mall iFengChao Furniture Showroom opened as a complement to their online stores.\n\nIn June 2011, [[Alibaba Group]] Executive Chairman and former CEO [[Jack Ma]] announced that Taobao would split into three different companies: Taobao Marketplace (a C2C platform), Tmall.com (a B2C platform; then called Taobao Mall), and eTao (a search engine for online shopping). The move was said to be necessary for Taobao to \u201cmeet competitive threats that emerged in the past two years during which the Internet and e-commerce landscape has changed dramatically.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-06-16/alibaba-group-to-split-taobao-online-shopping-mall-into-three-companies|title=Alibaba Group to Split Taobao Online Retail Unit Into Three|accessdate=12 May 2017|via=www.bloomberg.com}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2012 onward, Taobao began to accept international [[Visa, Inc.|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]] [[credit card|credit]] and [[debit card]]s;<ref>[http://www.taobao.com/go/chn/oversea/taobao_accept_oversea_credit_card_2012.php \u6dd8\u5b9d\u5168\u9762\u63a5\u53d7\u6d77\u5916\u4fe1\u7528\u5361\u4ed8\u6b3e], Taobao.com</ref> prior, only domestic banks were supported by AliPay.<ref>2011-10-19, [http://finance.ifeng.com/roll/20111019/4871239.shtml \u652f\u4ed8\u5b9d\u5c06\u5411\u5168\u7403\u5f00\u653e \u56fd\u5916\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u8d2d\u7269\u6dd8\u5b9d], [[Phoenix TV]] Finance</ref>\n\nOn April 29, 2013, Alibaba announced an investment of US$586 million in [[Sina Weibo]].

Ma introduced Taobao to the outside world by stating, \"We are the ant army.\" Ma once organized more than 2,000 employees at a gymnasium to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the founding ceremony. At the party, Taobao employees waved the Taobao mascot \u2014 the flag of \"ants.\" At the end of the celebration that lasted for four hours, all the employees stood hand-in-hand, singing \"If you do not experience wind and rain, you cannot see the rainbow. The ants that be organized together can beat the elephant.\"\n\n=== Shop feedback ===\n\nTo thoroughly investigate a Taobao shop, a good way is to view its feedback by clicking the shop's rating icon. For Tmall.com shops, people click the stars to view their ratings. Taobao users usually spend time to read feedback and compare items of one shop with those of others.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to read taobao shop feedbacks?\". NewBuyBay Taobao Agent. January 13, 2013|url=http://www.newbuybay.com/Article/ArtView/126}}</ref> Feedback put up by the user can be genuine or made up which users have to thoroughly read through to conclude. If the feedback style and tone is same, likely, it's made up. Some of the feedback can also be posted by competitors. Users have to look at the majority of the feedback to deduce whether the feedback are genuine. The best way to conclude whether the item is truly worth buying is to look at the available feedback that are posted by users after they've used the item for a period of time.\n\nFor every trade deal on Taobao, there must be a section of customer feedback, which is a determination factor of the sale volume for the shop. Therefore, the shop owners often put effort to maximize the positive comments and eliminate the negative ones. Even profitable negotiations happen between sellers and the consumers for rating their satisfactions toward the commodity and their shopping experiences.\nIn order to collect public perspectives towards Taobao services, searching tools and other functions are used to determine and learn the users\u2019 demands, which could help Taobao make more improvements; There are also surveys handed out to Taobao consumers including the following parts:\n\n\u00b7The obstacles that you encounter while using the product.\n\n\u00b7Your advises and reviews of the product.\n\n\u00b7The frequencies of your uses on the product, or the importance of that particular product to the users themselves.\n\n\u00b7The satisfaction level towards the specific aspects, including visual and typographic layout, procedure and instruction guide.\n\n\u00b7The overall satisfaction level towards the product.\n\n=== Alipay ===\n{{main|Alipay}}\nLaunched in 2004, Alipay ({{zh|s=\u652f\u4ed8\u5b9d|t=\u652f\u4ed8\u5bf6|p=Zh\u012bf\u00f9b\u01ceo}}), an [[escrow]]-based [[online payment]] platform, is the preferred payment solution for transactions on Taobao Marketplace. It is the most widely used third-party online payment solution in China.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alibaba is building its Alipay payments service into the PayPal of the East|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2013/10/17/alibaba-is-building-its-alipay-payments-service-into-the-paypal-of-the-east/|work=The Next Web|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref> To ensure safe transactions, Alipay uses an escrow system through which payment is only released to the seller once the buyer has received his or her goods in satisfactory condition. According to the Alibaba Group web site, Alipay is partnered with multiple financial institutions as well as Visa and MasterCard to facilitate payments in China and abroad.<ref name=\"Alibaba Group Company Overview\" />\n\nAlipay systems are separate for different groups of users. For instance, Alipay users may send and receive funds if they have an account that added a credit card issued in China, whereas users who use credit cards issued outside China may only use Alipay to pay for goods or services from Taobao.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294211-i642-k5228085-Recharge_a_China_Mobile_pre_pay_account_outside_of_China-China.html|title=Recharge a China Mobile pre-pay account outside of China? - China Forum - TripAdvisor|website=www.tripadvisor.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref> This has proven problematic for international users of Taobao, as they are unable to receive refunds that are not issued via the Taobao system.\n\nRegulatory changes issued by the People's Bank of China (Central Bank of China) are set to alter the Chinese online payment ecosystem forever. Top-tier digital payment services such as WeChat Pay and Alipay are expected to transfer all relevant transaction data to appropriate agencies starting June 30, 2018.\n\n=== AliExpress ===\n{{main|AliExpress}}\n[[File:Aliexpress.jpg|thumb|Aliexpress]]\nAliExpress was created in April 2010 as an international retailing website. People who live overseas can use the service to purchase items from Chinese manufactures online.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alibaba Group Offitional website|url=http://www.alibabagroup.com/cn/about/businesses}}</ref>\n\n=== AliWangWang (TradeManager) ===\n\nA distinctive feature of shopping on Taobao Marketplace is the ease of communication between buyer and seller prior to the purchase through its embedded proprietary instant [[chat program]], named '''AliWangWang''' ({{zh|s=\u963f\u91cc\u65fa\u65fa|p=\u0100l\u01d0W\u00e0ngW\u00e0ng}}). It has become a habit among Chinese online shoppers to interact with the sellers through AliWangWang to inquire about products and to bargain prior to purchasing products.\n\n=== Baopals ===\n\nIn February 2016, 3 expats living in Shanghai launched [[Baopals]], a shopping platform that translates Taobao and [[Tmall]] into English so that foreigners living in China can access all of its products and services. Currently, over 2.4 million items have been sold on the platform.\n\n=== Happy Taobao ===\n\nIn Dec. 2009, Taobao, together with [[Hunan TV]], set up Happy Taobao, Inc for television shopping. Hunan TV launched an entertainment series called \"Happy Taobao\", while [[Taobao Marketplace]] created channels and independent websites.\n\n=== Other services ===\n\nTaobao Marketplace introduced various features and services to create a better user experience for online shoppers and retailers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shopping from China Taobao Shops|url=http://www.offerany.com/|website=OfferAny}}</ref> For instance, in January 2010, it launched the Taobao app, created by independent developers through the Taobao Open Platform, to be downloaded by consumers in Taobao App Store.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"Taobao Launches New Taobao App Store\".

Since then, the volume of trading has set a new high every year.\n\n=== Developing Strategy ===\n\nOn March 29, 2016, the CEO of Alibaba group, [[Daniel Zhang]], pointed out the three directions of the future development goals for Taobao: more community-based, more content-enabled and local adapted in the 2016 annual customer conference held in Hangzhou.\nTaobao extensively uses shopping strategies such as data personalizing, customer loyalties, video broadcasting and the focused demand of a single community to build stages for sellers to display their commodities. It is strictly constructing a new ecosystem from content producing, to content propagating, and content consuming with Alibaba's cooperating internet platforms like Youku, Weibo, Alimama and Alifilms.\nExcept for using centralized and demand-matching supplies depending on the need of users to form a self-operational system of content producing and consuming transmission, Taobao also improved the quality of the commodity and its services towards the consumers.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Adaptive Agent ===\nTaobao applies a searching tool named 'adaptive agents'. An adaptive agent picks up the signals from consumers\u2019 purchase records, including categories, brands, functions and colors etc.; The search engine involves the scanning of a particular bar code. Taobao tracks customers' purchasing history and reorganize it into a series of selections that the buyers are likely to be attracted to. The way that an adaptive agent works is image prior models plus the posterior data using BAYES theory (LAPLACE method):\nThe possibility of the occurrence of a certain event can be estimated through the frequency of its occurrence in the past.\nThe ranking of a product or a page can be determined by the combination of its prior information plus its posterior data of click transaction.\n\nThe popularity of Taobao's searching model is based on the calculation of correlation rate and quality scores:\n*The static score of a product's title (correlation rate).\n*The matching score of the title and query of a product (correlation rate).\n*The category model of a product (correlation rate).\n*The transaction model of the commodity (quality score).\n*The sellers model (quality score).\n*The feedback (quality score).\n\nTaobao increased its traffic by launching an app.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Semantic Search ===\n\nTaobao automatically classifies the text and images of the product, and uses tags to make the correlation match. The usage of the semantic search is to solve the correlative problem that key word texts cannot solve, such as images, complex texts, and ambiguous texts. Semantic search is also a way of recommendation that Taobao presents with more similar items consumers might find when searching one keyword. There are entity tagging and other classifications.\n\n=== Taobao for Southeast Asia ===\n\nIn September, 2013, Taobao launched its Southeast Asian site.

As a result, Taobao became mainland China's undisputed market leader within two years. Its market share surged from 8% to 59% between 2003 and 2005, while eBay China plunged from 79% to 36%.<ref>{{cite news|title=\"China's pied piper\". The Economist.

Taobao Mall established itself as the destination for quality brand name goods for Chinese consumers. Taobao Mall launched an independent web domain, [[Tmall]].com, and enhanced its focus on product verticals and improvements in shopping experience in November 2010.

Online shoppers can use the site to compare prices from different sellers and identify products to buy.

The ants that be organized together can beat the elephant.\"\n\n=== Shop feedback ===\n\nTo thoroughly investigate a Taobao shop, a good way is to view its feedback by clicking the shop's rating icon. For Tmall.com shops, people click the stars to view their ratings. Taobao users usually spend time to read feedback and compare items of one shop with those of others.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to read taobao shop feedbacks?\". NewBuyBay Taobao Agent. January 13, 2013|url=http://www.newbuybay.com/Article/ArtView/126}}</ref> Feedback put up by the user can be genuine or made up which users have to thoroughly read through to conclude. If the feedback style and tone is same, likely, it's made up. Some of the feedback can also be posted by competitors. Users have to look at the majority of the feedback to deduce whether the feedback are genuine. The best way to conclude whether the item is truly worth buying is to look at the available feedback that are posted by users after they've used the item for a period of time.\n\nFor every trade deal on Taobao, there must be a section of customer feedback, which is a determination factor of the sale volume for the shop. Therefore, the shop owners often put effort to maximize the positive comments and eliminate the negative ones. Even profitable negotiations happen between sellers and the consumers for rating their satisfactions toward the commodity and their shopping experiences.\nIn order to collect public perspectives towards Taobao services, searching tools and other functions are used to determine and learn the users\u2019 demands, which could help Taobao make more improvements; There are also surveys handed out to Taobao consumers including the following parts:\n\n\u00b7The obstacles that you encounter while using the product.\n\n\u00b7Your advises and reviews of the product.\n\n\u00b7The frequencies of your uses on the product, or the importance of that particular product to the users themselves.\n\n\u00b7The satisfaction level towards the specific aspects, including visual and typographic layout, procedure and instruction guide.\n\n\u00b7The overall satisfaction level towards the product.\n\n=== Alipay ===\n{{main|Alipay}}\nLaunched in 2004, Alipay ({{zh|s=\u652f\u4ed8\u5b9d|t=\u652f\u4ed8\u5bf6|p=Zh\u012bf\u00f9b\u01ceo}}), an [[escrow]]-based [[online payment]] platform, is the preferred payment solution for transactions on Taobao Marketplace.

According to the Alibaba Group web site, Alipay is partnered with multiple financial institutions as well as Visa and MasterCard to facilitate payments in China and abroad.<ref name=\"Alibaba Group Company Overview\" />\n\nAlipay systems are separate for different groups of users. For instance, Alipay users may send and receive funds if they have an account that added a credit card issued in China, whereas users who use credit cards issued outside China may only use Alipay to pay for goods or services from Taobao.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowTopic-g294211-i642-k5228085-Recharge_a_China_Mobile_pre_pay_account_outside_of_China-China.html|title=Recharge a China Mobile pre-pay account outside of China? - China Forum - TripAdvisor|website=www.tripadvisor.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref> This has proven problematic for international users of Taobao, as they are unable to receive refunds that are not issued via the Taobao system.\n\nRegulatory changes issued by the People's Bank of China (Central Bank of China) are set to alter the Chinese online payment ecosystem forever.

Currently, over 2.4 million items have been sold on the platform.\n\n=== Happy Taobao ===\n\nIn Dec. 2009, Taobao, together with [[Hunan TV]], set up Happy Taobao, Inc for television shopping.

Since then, the volume of trading has set a new high every year.\n\n=== Developing Strategy ===\n\nOn March 29, 2016, the CEO of Alibaba group, [[Daniel Zhang]], pointed out the three directions of the future development goals for Taobao: more community-based, more content-enabled and local adapted in the 2016 annual customer conference held in Hangzhou.\nTaobao extensively uses shopping strategies such as data personalizing, customer loyalties, video broadcasting and the focused demand of a single community to build stages for sellers to display their commodities. It is strictly constructing a new ecosystem from content producing, to content propagating, and content consuming with Alibaba's cooperating internet platforms like Youku, Weibo, Alimama and Alifilms.\nExcept for using centralized and demand-matching supplies depending on the need of users to form a self-operational system of content producing and consuming transmission, Taobao also improved the quality of the commodity and its services towards the consumers.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Adaptive Agent ===\nTaobao applies a searching tool named 'adaptive agents'. An adaptive agent picks up the signals from consumers\u2019 purchase records, including categories, brands, functions and colors etc.; The search engine involves the scanning of a particular bar code. Taobao tracks customers' purchasing history and reorganize it into a series of selections that the buyers are likely to be attracted to. The way that an adaptive agent works is image prior models plus the posterior data using BAYES theory (LAPLACE method):\nThe possibility of the occurrence of a certain event can be estimated through the frequency of its occurrence in the past.\nThe ranking of a product or a page can be determined by the combination of its prior information plus its posterior data of click transaction.\n\nThe popularity of Taobao's searching model is based on the calculation of correlation rate and quality scores:\n*The static score of a product's title (correlation rate).\n*The matching score of the title and query of a product (correlation rate).\n*The category model of a product (correlation rate).\n*The transaction model of the commodity (quality score).\n*The sellers model (quality score).\n*The feedback (quality score).\n\nTaobao increased its traffic by launching an app.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Semantic Search ===\n\nTaobao automatically classifies the text and images of the product, and uses tags to make the correlation match. The usage of the semantic search is to solve the correlative problem that key word texts cannot solve, such as images, complex texts, and ambiguous texts. Semantic search is also a way of recommendation that Taobao presents with more similar items consumers might find when searching one keyword. There are entity tagging and other classifications.\n\n=== Taobao for Southeast Asia ===\n\nIn September, 2013, Taobao launched its Southeast Asian site. A translation feature is now available on Taobao.com for major languages in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taobao for Southeast Asia|url=http://www.taobaothailand.com/taobao-%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9E%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AB/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203195115/http://www.taobaothailand.com/taobao-%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9E%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%95%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%AB/|archivedate=2014-02-03}}</ref>\n\n== Corporate social responsibility ==\n\nIn August 2017, in order to protect African children from being commercially exploited, the company has removed a controversial vendor ad campaign.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese vendors 'exploiting' African children removed from Taobao|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-40958209}}</ref>\n\n== Metrics ==\n\nTaobao Marketplace had more than 5 million registered users as of June 2013 and hosted more than 80 million product listings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.alibaba.com/specials/aboutalibaba/aligroup/index.html|title=Alibaba Group|website=news.alibaba.com|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref> It facilitated approximately RMB 200 billion in gross merchandise volume in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Taobao app|url=http://news.alibaba.com/article/detail/alibaba/100237896-1-taobao-launches-new-taobao-app.html|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref> In September 2013, Taobao ranked 12th overall in Alexa's internet rankings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/taobao.com|title=Taobao.com Traffic, Demographics and Competitors - Alexa|website=www.alexa.com|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref> For the year ending March 31, 2013, the combined gross merchandise volume (GMV) of Taobao and Tmall.com combined exceeded RMB 1 trillion.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|https://www.taobao.com}} {{in lang|zh}}\n\n{{Alibaba Group}}\n\n[[Category:2003 establishments in China]]\n[[Category:Alibaba Group]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2003]]\n[[Category:Notorious markets]]\n[[Category:Chinese brands]]\n[[Category:Online marketplaces of China]]\n", "name_user": "Matthewwu2003", "label": "safe", "comment": "Update on Double 11 sale volume", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taobao"}

In 1948, he went with his wife Lan-lan, a composer, to Paris to live on the same block in [[Montparnasse]] where the classes of [[\u00c9mile Othon Friesz]] took place. His earliest exhibitions in France were met with praise from [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and [[Picasso]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nZao and his wife pursued their own careers, their son having stayed in China with Zao's parents. In the mid-1950s, they were divorced. In 1957, Zao decided to visit the United States where his younger brother Chao Wu-Wai was living in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], close to the art scene of [[New York City]]. He wanted to learn more about \"pop art\". While in the US, he painted seven canvases at his brother's house. There are relatively few items dating from that year (1957). Years later, the largest canvas was given by his brother, Chao Wu-Wai, to the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Untitled, 1957 (oil on canvas) by Zao Wou-Ki|url=http://www.bridgemanart.com/image/Zao-Wou-Ki-b-1921/Untitled-1957-oil-on-canvas/a26c92f5ff644cfc91d6c8f93eef8787|publisher=Bridgeman Art Library|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe left the U.S. after a six-week stay, traveling to [[Tokyo]] and then to [[Hong Kong]], where he met his second wife Chan May-Kan (\u9648\u7f8e\u7434, [[:fr:May Zao|May Zao]]), a film actress who had two children from her first marriage. Under the influence of Zao, she became a successful sculptor.

He names them with the date in which he finishes them, and in them, masses of colours appear to materialise a creating world, like a [[Big Bang]], where light structures the canvas. He worked formats in [[triptych]]s and [[diptych]]s.

His earliest exhibitions in France were met with praise from [[Joan Mir\u00f3]] and [[Picasso]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nZao and his wife pursued their own careers, their son having stayed in China with Zao's parents. In the mid-1950s, they were divorced. In 1957, Zao decided to visit the United States where his younger brother Chao Wu-Wai was living in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], close to the art scene of [[New York City]]. He wanted to learn more about \"pop art\". While in the US, he painted seven canvases at his brother's house. There are relatively few items dating from that year (1957). Years later, the largest canvas was given by his brother, Chao Wu-Wai, to the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Untitled, 1957 (oil on canvas) by Zao Wou-Ki|url=http://www.bridgemanart.com/image/Zao-Wou-Ki-b-1921/Untitled-1957-oil-on-canvas/a26c92f5ff644cfc91d6c8f93eef8787|publisher=Bridgeman Art Library|accessdate=9 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe left the U.S. after a six-week stay, traveling to [[Tokyo]] and then to [[Hong Kong]], where he met his second wife Chan May-Kan (\u9648\u7f8e\u7434, [[:fr:May Zao|May Zao]]), a film actress who had two children from her first marriage.

The majority of 126s were produced in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]], [[Poland]], as the '''[[Polski Fiat]] 126p''', where production continued until 2000. In many markets Fiat stopped sales of the 126 in 1993 in favour of their new front-engined [[Fiat Cinquecento|Cinquecento]]. At a vehicle length of 3.05 metres, the Fiat 126 is almost exactly the same size as the original British [[Mini]], and although it came to market 14 years later, production ended in the same year (2000), and its total sales of almost 4.7 million units were in close range of the Mini's 5.4 million. In Poland the car became a [[cultural icon]] in a similar manner that the [[Trabant 601]] became for [[East Germany]] during the fall of the Berlin Wall, and earned the nickname ''Maluch'', meaning \"The Little One\" or \"Toddler\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/02/18/residents-in-polish-city-save-up-and-buy-tom-hanks-a-vintage-car-6456766/|title=Residents in Polish city save up and buy Tom Hanks a vintage car|first=Hannah Lawrence for|last=Metro.co.uk|date=18 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-hanks-poland-fiat-idUSKBN15F2CD|title=Polish fans buy Tom Hanks iconic 'toddler' car|date=31 January 2017|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2017|via=Reuters}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe 126 used much of the same mechanical underpinnings and layout as its Fiat 500 rear-engined predecessor with which it shared its [[wheelbase]], but featured an all new, slightly larger bodyshell similar to the larger [[Fiat 127]], which was designed by [[Sergio Sartorelli]] and improved safety and interior space.\n[[File:Trunk of a white left hand drive Fiat 126 produced in 1973.jpg|thumb|left|The front footwells, suspension, battery and spare wheel left little room for luggage in the 126 front trunk.]]\nEngine capacity was increased from 594&nbsp;cc to 652&nbsp;cc at the end of 1977 when the cylinder bore was increased from 73.5 to 77&nbsp;mm.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197724>{{cite journal| author = Ferdinand Simoneit (Ed)| title = Mehr Hubraum und Drehmoment fuer den Fiat 126| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]] | volume = 24 | page = 20 | date = 23 November 1977}}</ref> Claimed power output was unchanged at {{convert|23|HP|kW|0|abbr=on}}, but torque was increased from {{convert|39|N\u00b7m|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|43|N\u00b7m|lb.ft|0}}.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197724/>\nThe 594&nbsp;cc engines were still available in early 1983 production.\n\nA subsequent increase took the engine size to 704&nbsp;cc in new \"restyling\" model Fiat 126 Bis (1987\u20131991), with {{Convert|26|HP|kW|0|abbr=on}} of motive power.\n\n[[File:Auto Italia Stanford Hall June 2010 IMG 9616 (4680343746).jpg|thumb|left|Fiat 126 (second from left) at the Auto Italia, Stanford Hall, 2010]]\n\nIn Italy, the car was produced in the plants of [[Cassino]] and [[Termini Imerese]] until 1979. By this time 1,352,912 of the cars had been produced in Italy.\n\nThe car was also produced under licence by [[Zastava Automobiles|Zastava]] in [[Yugoslavia]]. In [[Austria]], it was briefly assembled by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch|Steyr Puch]] as a successor to the successful [[Puch 500]], but assembly only lasted until 1975 with only 2069 having been built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.steyrpuch.at/puch126.htm|title=STEYR-PUCH-FREUNDE OBERK\u00c4RNTEN|website=www.steyrpuch.at|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref> In [[Greece]], there was an attempt to produce a small car named [[DIM (automobiles)|DIM]] whose technical layout was largely based on the 126, but only ten were produced before the project was abandoned.\n\nThe 126 never achieved the frenzied popularity of the 500 in Western Europe, partly due to the fact that rear-engined small cars were considered outdated by the time it arrived as the Mini had paved the way for [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|front-engine, front-wheel drive]] small cars. Despite this, it still proved popular in Eastern Europe and remained in production for a long time, thus becoming one of the last and longest-living rear-engine small cars manufactured in Europe. In fact, it was only survived by the [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW Beetle]] whose production lasted until 2003, although production in Europe ceased in 1978, making the 126 the last rear-engine small car to be manufactured in Europe.{{Dubious|Rear-engined small cars still being made in Europe |reason=Various Smart models are rear-engined, small and manufactured in Europe even at the time of this tagging|date=September 2019}}\n\nFor a brief period in the early 1990s, a German company called POP also offered convertible versions of the 126 BIS. Two models were offered: a lesser equipped one called the \"POP 650\" and a more luxurious model called the \"POP 2000\".\n\n{{clear_left}}\n\n== Polski Fiat 126p ==\n[[File:Polski Fiat 126p rocznik 1973.jpg|thumb|right|1973 Polski Fiat 126p (Poland)]]\n\nIn [[Poland]], the car was produced under licence by [[Fabryka Samochod\u00f3w Ma\u0142olitra\u017cowych]] (FSM) (En: Small-Engined Car Factory) in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]] and [[Tychy]] under the brand [[Polski Fiat]] 126p (literally in English: ''Polish Fiat 126p'') between 1973 and 2000.\n\nDue to a relatively low price it was very popular in Poland and was arguably the most popular Polish car in the 1980s. Its very small size gave it the nickname '''''maluch''''' (\"the small one\", \"small child\", pronounced {{IPA-pl|\u02c8malux|}}). The nickname became so popular that in 1997 it was accepted by the manufacturer as the official name of the car.\n[[File:FSM Niki 650 (14821160718).jpg|thumb|A 126 in Australia, sold locally as the FSM Niki.]]\nAt first it was almost identical with the basic model: differences included a higher chassis, a modified grille on the back, and the front indicator lenses that were clear white in Italy but orange in other markets. To distinguish it from the original Italian car, the letter \"p\" was added to its name.\n\nThroughout the 1980s the 126p was continuously modified. First it received upgraded brakes and new wheels from Italian Fiat, then hazard warning lights were added to meet new lighting requirements.\n\nIn 1984, the 126 received a facelift, giving it plastic bumpers (for all versions) and a new dashboard. This model was named the Fiat 126p FL. In 1985 a single rear fog light and reversing light (on opposite sides) were added to the standard plastic bumpers; an electronic ignition system and alternator replaced the undersized generator in around 1987. In 1994, the 126p received another facelift, and some parts from the [[Fiat Cinquecento]]; this version was named 126 EL. The 126 ELX introduced a catalytic converter.\n\nIn 1987 the 126 BIS went into production, featuring a water-cooled 704&nbsp;cc engine of Polish construction. However, the original model continued to be produced for the Polish market. BIS used some of parts from [[Fiat cinquecento]].\n\nThe factory battery in 126p had only a 35 Amp-hour capacity, which, combined with undersized generator, resulted in the car never having a fully charged battery unless driven for an extended time. Some owners upgraded to a 45 Amp-hour battery from the Fiat 125p (1.5 Liter engine) to improve the cold start reliability.\n\n[[File:GeneralLeeFiat.JPG|thumb|right|A modified Fiat 126]]\n\nThe 126p was exported to many [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and for several years it was one of the most popular cars in [[Poland]] and in [[Hungary]] as well. It also found a minor market in Australia between 1989 and 1992, under the name '''FSM Niki'''. During that period it was Australia's cheapest car.<ref>{{cite web|title=FSM Niki 650, too little, too late|url=http://www.transeum.com/worlds-worst-cars/fsm-niki-650-too-little-too-late.html|publisher=Transeum|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> There was a convertible version developed for the Australian market.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} It was also successful in [[Cuba]] where it was one of the best-selling cars of its time and an estimated 10.000 still exist today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/polish-fiat-126p-sees-unlikely-cuban-revival/a-19464887|title=Polish Fiat 126p sees unlikely Cuban revival {{!}} DW {{!}} 11 August 2016|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, there were several experimental prototypes developed in Poland. A cargo version called \"Bombel\" (literally \"bubble\", but also a colloquial term for \"small child\") because of its fibreglass bubble-shaped cargo area; an off-road version propelled by caterpillar tracks and a front wheel drive, front engined model, with a longer front end and a flat cargo area in the rear where the original 126 had its engine. The rear of this prototype was similar to the 126 Bis which also had a rear hatch for accessing a cargo space created by mounting its flat water-cooled engine under the floor.\n\nThere was also an attempt at installing a small diesel engine (due to gasoline rationing) in the classic 126p body. It is also a popular platform for electric engine and motorcycle engine swaps.\n\n=== History of PF 126p ===\n[[File:Fiat 126 BIS during \u201eXXX lat motoryzacji PRL\u201d exhibition at Bonarka City Center in Krak\u00f3w.JPG|thumb|From 1987 the 126 became available as a hatchback, in spite of having the engine in the rear.]]\n* 1972 \u2013 the FSM car factory was built in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]].\n* 6 June 1973 \u2013 the first Polski Fiat 126p constructed from Italian parts.

During the absolute rule of the [[PZPR]], a private car was considered a luxury item, due to limited availability and low salaries. In 1971 there were only 556,000 passenger cars in Poland.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Marcin | last = Zaremba | url = http://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/good-bye-gierek,395534.html| title = Good bye, Gierek! | journal = [[Polityka]] | volume = 45 | year = 2004 | issue = 2477 | page = 79 | language = Polish }}</ref> In a top-down [[planned economy]], decisions on whether a state-owned factory could produce a car were taken on political and not just economic grounds. The authorities themselves initially did not find the idea of private cars attractive. The first relatively cheap Polish car was the [[FSO Syrena|Syrena]], but it was outdated and its production was limited. Limited numbers of cars were also imported from other Eastern Bloc countries. It was difficult to buy a Western car because the [[Polish z\u0142oty]], like other currencies in communist states, was not convertible to Western funds and there was no free market in the country.\n\nThus, the PF 126p was intended to be the first real, popular and affordable car, to provide mobility for ordinary families. The licence was bought after the rise to power of a new [[PZPR]] leader, [[Edward Gierek]], who wanted to gain popular favour by increasing consumer spending after the austerity period under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]]. Despite the fact that it was a very small [[city car]], it was the only choice for most families, filling the role of a [[family car]].

In many markets Fiat stopped sales of the 126 in 1993 in favour of their new front-engined [[Fiat Cinquecento|Cinquecento]]. At a vehicle length of 3.05 metres, the Fiat 126 is almost exactly the same size as the original British [[Mini]], and although it came to market 14 years later, production ended in the same year (2000), and its total sales of almost 4.7 million units were in close range of the Mini's 5.4 million. In Poland the car became a [[cultural icon]] in a similar manner that the [[Trabant 601]] became for [[East Germany]] during the fall of the Berlin Wall, and earned the nickname ''Maluch'', meaning \"The Little One\" or \"Toddler\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/02/18/residents-in-polish-city-save-up-and-buy-tom-hanks-a-vintage-car-6456766/|title=Residents in Polish city save up and buy Tom Hanks a vintage car|first=Hannah Lawrence for|last=Metro.co.uk|date=18 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-hanks-poland-fiat-idUSKBN15F2CD|title=Polish fans buy Tom Hanks iconic 'toddler' car|date=31 January 2017|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2017|via=Reuters}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe 126 used much of the same mechanical underpinnings and layout as its Fiat 500 rear-engined predecessor with which it shared its [[wheelbase]], but featured an all new, slightly larger bodyshell similar to the larger [[Fiat 127]], which was designed by [[Sergio Sartorelli]] and improved safety and interior space.\n[[File:Trunk of a white left hand drive Fiat 126 produced in 1973.jpg|thumb|left|The front footwells, suspension, battery and spare wheel left little room for luggage in the 126 front trunk.]]\nEngine capacity was increased from 594&nbsp;cc to 652&nbsp;cc at the end of 1977 when the cylinder bore was increased from 73.5 to 77&nbsp;mm.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197724>{{cite journal| author = Ferdinand Simoneit (Ed)| title = Mehr Hubraum und Drehmoment fuer den Fiat 126| journal = [[Auto, Motor und Sport]] | volume = 24 | page = 20 | date = 23 November 1977}}</ref> Claimed power output was unchanged at {{convert|23|HP|kW|0|abbr=on}}, but torque was increased from {{convert|39|N\u00b7m|lb.ft|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|43|N\u00b7m|lb.ft|0}}.<ref name=AutoMotoruSport197724/>\nThe 594&nbsp;cc engines were still available in early 1983 production.\n\nA subsequent increase took the engine size to 704&nbsp;cc in new \"restyling\" model Fiat 126 Bis (1987\u20131991), with {{Convert|26|HP|kW|0|abbr=on}} of motive power.\n\n[[File:Auto Italia Stanford Hall June 2010 IMG 9616 (4680343746).jpg|thumb|left|Fiat 126 (second from left) at the Auto Italia, Stanford Hall, 2010]]\n\nIn Italy, the car was produced in the plants of [[Cassino]] and [[Termini Imerese]] until 1979. By this time 1,352,912 of the cars had been produced in Italy.\n\nThe car was also produced under licence by [[Zastava Automobiles|Zastava]] in [[Yugoslavia]]. In [[Austria]], it was briefly assembled by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch|Steyr Puch]] as a successor to the successful [[Puch 500]], but assembly only lasted until 1975 with only 2069 having been built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.steyrpuch.at/puch126.htm|title=STEYR-PUCH-FREUNDE OBERK\u00c4RNTEN|website=www.steyrpuch.at|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref> In [[Greece]], there was an attempt to produce a small car named [[DIM (automobiles)|DIM]] whose technical layout was largely based on the 126, but only ten were produced before the project was abandoned.\n\nThe 126 never achieved the frenzied popularity of the 500 in Western Europe, partly due to the fact that rear-engined small cars were considered outdated by the time it arrived as the Mini had paved the way for [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|front-engine, front-wheel drive]] small cars. Despite this, it still proved popular in Eastern Europe and remained in production for a long time, thus becoming one of the last and longest-living rear-engine small cars manufactured in Europe. In fact, it was only survived by the [[Volkswagen Beetle|VW Beetle]] whose production lasted until 2003, although production in Europe ceased in 1978, making the 126 the last rear-engine small car to be manufactured in Europe.{{Dubious|Rear-engined small cars still being made in Europe |reason=Various Smart models are rear-engined, small and manufactured in Europe even at the time of this tagging|date=September 2019}}\n\nFor a brief period in the early 1990s, a German company called POP also offered convertible versions of the 126 BIS. Two models were offered: a lesser equipped one called the \"POP 650\" and a more luxurious model called the \"POP 2000\".\n\n{{clear_left}}\n\n== Polski Fiat 126p ==\n[[File:Polski Fiat 126p rocznik 1973.jpg|thumb|right|1973 Polski Fiat 126p (Poland)]]\n\nIn [[Poland]], the car was produced under licence by [[Fabryka Samochod\u00f3w Ma\u0142olitra\u017cowych]] (FSM) (En: Small-Engined Car Factory) in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]] and [[Tychy]] under the brand [[Polski Fiat]] 126p (literally in English: ''Polish Fiat 126p'') between 1973 and 2000.\n\nDue to a relatively low price it was very popular in Poland and was arguably the most popular Polish car in the 1980s. Its very small size gave it the nickname '''''maluch''''' (\"the small one\", \"small child\", pronounced {{IPA-pl|\u02c8malux|}}). The nickname became so popular that in 1997 it was accepted by the manufacturer as the official name of the car.\n[[File:FSM Niki 650 (14821160718).jpg|thumb|A 126 in Australia, sold locally as the FSM Niki.]]\nAt first it was almost identical with the basic model: differences included a higher chassis, a modified grille on the back, and the front indicator lenses that were clear white in Italy but orange in other markets. To distinguish it from the original Italian car, the letter \"p\" was added to its name.\n\nThroughout the 1980s the 126p was continuously modified. First it received upgraded brakes and new wheels from Italian Fiat, then hazard warning lights were added to meet new lighting requirements.\n\nIn 1984, the 126 received a facelift, giving it plastic bumpers (for all versions) and a new dashboard. This model was named the Fiat 126p FL. In 1985 a single rear fog light and reversing light (on opposite sides) were added to the standard plastic bumpers; an electronic ignition system and alternator replaced the undersized generator in around 1987. In 1994, the 126p received another facelift, and some parts from the [[Fiat Cinquecento]]; this version was named 126 EL. The 126 ELX introduced a catalytic converter.\n\nIn 1987 the 126 BIS went into production, featuring a water-cooled 704&nbsp;cc engine of Polish construction. However, the original model continued to be produced for the Polish market. BIS used some of parts from [[Fiat cinquecento]].\n\nThe factory battery in 126p had only a 35 Amp-hour capacity, which, combined with undersized generator, resulted in the car never having a fully charged battery unless driven for an extended time. Some owners upgraded to a 45 Amp-hour battery from the Fiat 125p (1.5 Liter engine) to improve the cold start reliability.\n\n[[File:GeneralLeeFiat.JPG|thumb|right|A modified Fiat 126]]\n\nThe 126p was exported to many [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and for several years it was one of the most popular cars in [[Poland]] and in [[Hungary]] as well. It also found a minor market in Australia between 1989 and 1992, under the name '''FSM Niki'''. During that period it was Australia's cheapest car.<ref>{{cite web|title=FSM Niki 650, too little, too late|url=http://www.transeum.com/worlds-worst-cars/fsm-niki-650-too-little-too-late.html|publisher=Transeum|accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> There was a convertible version developed for the Australian market.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} It was also successful in [[Cuba]] where it was one of the best-selling cars of its time and an estimated 10.000 still exist today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/polish-fiat-126p-sees-unlikely-cuban-revival/a-19464887|title=Polish Fiat 126p sees unlikely Cuban revival {{!}} DW {{!}} 11 August 2016|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1980s, there were several experimental prototypes developed in Poland. A cargo version called \"Bombel\" (literally \"bubble\", but also a colloquial term for \"small child\") because of its fibreglass bubble-shaped cargo area; an off-road version propelled by caterpillar tracks and a front wheel drive, front engined model, with a longer front end and a flat cargo area in the rear where the original 126 had its engine. The rear of this prototype was similar to the 126 Bis which also had a rear hatch for accessing a cargo space created by mounting its flat water-cooled engine under the floor.\n\nThere was also an attempt at installing a small diesel engine (due to gasoline rationing) in the classic 126p body. It is also a popular platform for electric engine and motorcycle engine swaps.\n\n=== History of PF 126p ===\n[[File:Fiat 126 BIS during \u201eXXX lat motoryzacji PRL\u201d exhibition at Bonarka City Center in Krak\u00f3w.JPG|thumb|From 1987 the 126 became available as a hatchback, in spite of having the engine in the rear.]]\n* 1972 \u2013 the FSM car factory was built in [[Bielsko-Bia\u0142a]].\n* 6 June 1973 \u2013 the first Polski Fiat 126p constructed from Italian parts.

During the absolute rule of the [[PZPR]], a private car was considered a luxury item, due to limited availability and low salaries. In 1971 there were only 556,000 passenger cars in Poland.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Marcin | last = Zaremba | url = http://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/good-bye-gierek,395534.html| title = Good bye, Gierek! | journal = [[Polityka]] | volume = 45 | year = 2004 | issue = 2477 | page = 79 | language = Polish }}</ref> In a top-down [[planned economy]], decisions on whether a state-owned factory could produce a car were taken on political and not just economic grounds. The authorities themselves initially did not find the idea of private cars attractive. The first relatively cheap Polish car was the [[FSO Syrena|Syrena]], but it was outdated and its production was limited. Limited numbers of cars were also imported from other Eastern Bloc countries. It was difficult to buy a Western car because the [[Polish z\u0142oty]], like other currencies in communist states, was not convertible to Western funds and there was no free market in the country.\n\nThus, the PF 126p was intended to be the first real, popular and affordable car, to provide mobility for ordinary families. The licence was bought after the rise to power of a new [[PZPR]] leader, [[Edward Gierek]], who wanted to gain popular favour by increasing consumer spending after the austerity period under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]]. Despite the fact that it was a very small [[city car]], it was the only choice for most families, filling the role of a [[family car]].
