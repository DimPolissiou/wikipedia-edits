They live in solitude, [and] there are times in my life [when] I just want to be by myself. There are times I can't even figure myself out. I feel they are very complex creatures, [but] at the same time, they're sexy, too. That's why they represent Aaliyah pretty well. They're dangerous, but quite beautiful.

There were two distinct events involved in the incident: a triangular formation of lights seen to pass over the state, and a series of stationary lights seen in the Phoenix area. The [[United States Air Force]] claimed the second group of lights were flares dropped by [[A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10 Warthog]] aircraft that supposedly were on training exercises at the [[Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range|Barry Goldwater Range]] in southwest Arizona but an FOIA request from 2019 by John Greenewald revealed that the Air Force didn't drop any Flares nor had they any exercises at that point in time{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}.

He said it was about the \"size of a ([[Boeing]]) [[Boeing 747|747]]\", sounded like \"rushing wind\",<ref name=\"summary\">{{cite web|title=Summary of \"Phoenix Lights\" Event|url=http://www.ufoevidence.org/documents/doc1276.htm|accessdate=2007-03-20}}</ref> and had six lights on its leading edge. The lights reportedly traversed northwest to the southeast. \n\nAn unidentified former police officer from [[Paulden, Arizona]], is claimed to have been the next person to report a sighting, after leaving his house at about 20:15 MST.  As he was driving north, he allegedly saw a cluster of reddish or orange lights in the sky, comprising four lights together and a fifth light trailing them.  Each of the individual lights in the formation appeared to the witness to consist of two separate point sources of orange light. He returned home and through binoculars watched the lights until they disappeared south over the horizon.<ref name=\"summary\" />\n\n===Prescott and Prescott Valley===\nLights were also reportedly seen in the areas of [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] and [[Prescott Valley, Arizona|Prescott Valley]].  At approximately 20:17 MST, callers began reporting the object was definitely solid, because it blocked out much of the starry sky as it passed over.<ref>http://www.phoenixlightsufo.com/ Tim Ley, eyewitness, in his own words.</ref>\n\nJohn Kaiser was standing outside with his wife and sons in Prescott Valley when they noticed a cluster of lights to the west-northwest of their position. The lights formed a triangular pattern, but all of them appeared to be red, except the light at the nose of the object, which was distinctly white. The object, or objects, which had been observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes with binoculars, then passed directly over the observers, were seen to \"Bank to the right\", and then disappeared in the night sky to the southeast of Prescott Valley.  The altitude could not be determined; however, the object was fairly low and made no sound whatsoever.<ref>[http://www.nuforc.org/CB970313.html Ufo Events Over Arizona<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe [[National UFO Reporting Center]] received the following report from the Prescott area:\n{{Cquote|While doing [[astrophotography]] I observed five yellow-white lights in a [[V formation|\"V\" formation]] moving slowly from the northwest, across the sky to the northeast, then turn almost due south and continue until out of sight. The point of the \"V\" was in the direction of movement. The first three lights were in a fairly tight \"V\" while two of the lights were further back along the lines of the \"V\"'s legs. During the NW-NE transit one of the trailing lights moved up and joined the three and then dropped back to the trailing position. I estimated the three light \"V\" to cover about 0.5 degrees of sky and the whole group of five lights to cover about 1 degree of sky.<ref>http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02076.html</ref>}}\n\n===Dewey===\nAt the town of [[Dewey, Arizona|Dewey]], 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) east of [[Prescott, Arizona]], six people saw a large cluster of lights while driving northbound on Highway 69.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===First sighting from Phoenix===\n{{unref|section|date=March 2019}}\nTim Ley and his wife Bobbi, his son Hal and his grandson Damien Turnidge first saw the lights when they were above [[Prescott Valley, Arizona|Prescott Valley]] about 65 miles (100&nbsp;km) away from them. At first, the lights appeared to them as five separate and distinct lights in an arc-shape, as if they were on top of a balloon, but they soon realized that the lights appeared to be moving towards them. Over the next ten or so minutes, the lights appeared to come closer, the distance between the lights increased, and they took on the shape of an upside down V. Eventually, when the lights appeared to be a couple of miles away, the witnesses could make out a shape that looked like a 60-degree [[carpenter's square]], with the five lights set into it, with one at the front and two on each side. Soon, the object with the embedded lights appeared to be coming right down the street where they lived, about 100 to 150 feet (30 to 45 meters) above them, traveling so slowly that it appeared to hover and was silent. The object then seemed to pass over their heads and went through a V opening in the peaks of the mountain range towards [[Piestewa Peak|Squaw Peak Mountain]] and toward the direction of [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Witnesses in Glendale, a suburb northwest of Phoenix, saw the object pass overhead at an altitude high enough to become obscured by the thin clouds; this was at approximately between 20:30 and 20:45 MST.\n\n===Arriving in Phoenix===\nWhen the triangular formation entered the Phoenix area, Bill Greiner, a cement driver hauling a load down a mountain north of Phoenix, described the second group of lights: \"I'll never be the same.

Almost all known images are of the second event. All known images were produced using a variety of commercially available [[camcorders]] and [[cameras]]. There are no known images taken by equipment designed for scientific analysis, nor are there any known images taken using high powered optics or [[night vision]] equipment.\n\n===First event===\nThere are few known images of the Prescott/Dewey lights. Television station KSAZ reported that an individual named Richard Curtis recorded a detailed video that purportedly showed the outline of a space craft, but that the video had been lost. The only other known video is of poor quality and shows a group of lights with no craft visible.\n\n===Second event===\nDuring the Phoenix event, numerous still photographs and videotapes were made, distinctly showing a series of lights appearing at a regular interval, remaining illuminated for several moments and then going out. These images have been repeatedly aired by  documentary television channels such as the [[Discovery Channel]] and the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] as part of their UFO documentary programming. \n\nThe most frequently seen sequence shows what appears to be an arc of lights appearing one by one, then going out one by one. UFO advocates claim that these images show that the lights were some form of \"running light\" or other aircraft illumination along the leading edge of a large craft&nbsp;\u2014 estimated to be as large as a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) in diameter&nbsp;\u2014  hovering over the city of Phoenix. Other similar sequences reportedly taken over a half hour period show differing numbers of lights in a V or arrowhead array. Thousands of witnesses throughout Arizona also reported a silent, mile wide V or boomerang shaped craft with varying numbers of huge orbs. A significant number of witnesses reported that the craft was silently gliding directly overhead at low altitude. The first-hand witnesses consistently reported that the lights appeared as \"canisters of swimming light\", while the underbelly of the craft was undulating \"like looking through water\".<ref>Dateline NBC ''The Phoenix Lights'' http://msnbcecn.vo.llnwd.net/e1/video/flash/x_30_dtl_UFO1_080517.flv</ref> However, skeptics claim that the video is evidence that mountains not visible at night partially obstructed views from certain angles, thereby bolstering the claim that the lights were more distant than UFO advocates claim.<ref name=\"Hack\" />\n\nUFO advocate Jim Dilettoso claimed to have performed \"[[Spectroscopy|spectral analysis]]\" of photographs and video imagery that proved the lights could not have been produced by a man-made source. Dilettoso claimed to have used software called \"Image Pro Plus\" (exact version unknown) to determine the amount of red, green and blue in the various photographic and video images and construct histograms of the data, which were then compared to several photographs known to be of flares. Several sources have pointed out, however, that it is impossible to determine the spectral signature of a light source based solely on photographic or video imagery, as film and electronics inherently alter the spectral signature of a light source by shifting hue in the visible spectrum, and experts in spectroscopy have dismissed his claims as being scientifically invalid.<ref name=\"Hack\">{{cite news |last=Ortega |first=Tony |date=1998-03-05 |title=The Hack and the Quack |publisher=[[Phoenix New Times]] |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1998-03-05/news/the-hack-and-the-quack/ |accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref><ref name=\"skeptoid\">{{cite web |date= |title=The Alien Invasion of Phoenix, Arizona |publisher=Skeptoid.com |url=http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4041 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> Normal photographic equipment also eliminates light outside the visible spectrum&nbsp;\u2014 e.g., [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]]&nbsp;\u2014 that would be necessary for a complete spectral analysis. The maker of \"Image Pro Plus\", Media Cybernetic, has stated that its software is incapable of performing spectroscopic analysis.<ref name=\"Hack\"/>\n\nCognitech, an independent video laboratory, superimposed video imagery taken of the Phoenix Lights onto video imagery it shot during daytime from the same location. In the composite image, the lights are seen to extinguish at the moment they reach the [[Sierra Estrella|Estrella mountain range]], which is visible in the daytime, but invisible in the footage shot at night. A broadcast by local [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] affiliate [[KSAZ-TV]] claimed to have performed a similar test that showed the lights were in front of the mountain range and suggested that the Cognitech data might have been altered. Dr. Paul Scowen, visiting professor of Astronomy at [[Arizona State University]], performed a third analysis using daytime imagery overlaid with video shot of the lights and his findings were consistent with Cognitech. The ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' subsequently reported the television station had simply overlaid two video tracks on a video editing machine without using a computer to match the zoom and scale of the two images.<ref name=\"Hack\" />\n\n==Wind direction data==\nWind direction measured independently by several weather stations in the Phoenix area and archived by the [[National Centers for Environmental Information]] is consistent with reports about the movement of the lights. During the events, [[wind direction]] (origin) was changing from roughly west (i.e., blowing towards the east) to north (i.e., blowing towards the south). This supports the hypothesis that the flying objects were wind driven and could simply have been balloons (such as [[Sky lantern|sky lanterns]] or other [[Balloon-carried light effect|balloon-carried light effects]]) or flares.\n\n[[File:Phoenix, AZ - Wind direction (origin) on March 13-14 1997.svg|thumb|center|1000px| Wind direction in Phoenix, AZ on  March 13\u201314, 1997. '''Wind is reported by the direction from which it originates'''. Data courtesy of NOAA National Climate Data Center.]]\n\n==Explanations==\nThere is some controversy as to how best to classify the reports on the night in question. Some are of the opinion that the differing nature of the eyewitness reports indicates that several unidentified objects were in the area, each of which was its own separate \"event\". This is largely dismissed by skeptics as an over-extrapolation from the kind of deviation common in necessarily subjective eyewitness accounts. The media and most skeptical investigators have largely preferred to split the sightings into two distinct classes, a first and second event, for which two separate explanations are offered:\n\n===First event===\nThe first event&nbsp;\u2014 the \"V\", which appeared over northern Arizona and gradually traveled south over nearly the entire length of the state, eventually passing south of Tucson&nbsp;\u2014 was the apparently \"wedge-shaped\" object reported by then-Governor Symington and many others. This event started at about 20:15 MST over the Prescott area, and was seen south of Tucson by about 20:45 MST.\n\nProponents of two separate events propose that the first event still has no provable explanation, but that some evidence exists that the lights were in fact airplanes. According to an article by reporter Janet Gonzales that appeared in the ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'', videotape of the v shape shows the lights moving as separate entities, not as a single object; a phenomenon known as [[illusory contours]] can cause the human eye to see unconnected lines or dots as forming a single shape.  \n\nMitch Stanley, an amateur astronomer, observed high altitude lights flying in formation using a [[Dobsonian telescope]] giving 43x magnification. After observing the lights, he told his mother, who was present at the time, that the lights were aircraft.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ortega |first=Tony |date=1997-06-26 |title=The Great UFO Coverup |publisher=[[Phoenix New Times]] |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1997-06-26/news/the-great-ufo-cover-up/ |accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref> According to Stanley, the lights were quite clearly individual airplanes; a companion who was with him recalled asking Stanley at the time what the lights were, and he said, \"Planes\". When Stanley first gave an account of his observation at the Discovery Channel Town Hall Meeting with all the witnesses there he was shouted down in his assertion that what he saw was what other witnesses saw. Obviously Stanley was seeing the Maryland National Guard jets flying in formation on their way to drop high-altitude flares at the Barry M. Goldwater bombing range south of Phoenix. His account as to the nature of the lights that moved in formation that night is contradicted by some Phoenix residents without high powered telescopes, however, and no military or civilian aircraft formations were known to have been flying in the area at that time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Of course, the Maryland National Guard jets were not known about at that time because their mission was a classified military mission.\n\nAdditionally, [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] includes the western campus of [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] where flight training occurs with a large fleet of light aircraft. An additional whispered theory on campus is that the aircraft in formation were ERAU aircraft flying in formation with transponders and lights off as a prank. It is treated as an open secret as such behavior is a severe violation of FAA and ERAU rules.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Second event===\nThe second event was the set of nine lights appearing to \"hover\" over the city of Phoenix at around 10 pm. The second event has been more thoroughly covered by the media, due in part to the numerous video images taken of the lights. This was also observed by numerous people who may have thought they were seeing the same lights as those reported earlier.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force explained the second event as slow-falling, long-burning LUU-2B/B illumination [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|flares]] dropped by a flight of four [[A-10 Warthog]] aircraft on a training exercise at the Barry Goldwater Range at Western Pima county. According to this explanation, the flares would have been visible in Phoenix and appeared to hover due to rising heat from the burning flares creating a \"balloon\" effect on their parachutes, which slowed the descent.<ref name=\"azcentral.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/0225phxlights0225.html |title=Craven, Scott. \"Intrigue persists over lights in sky.\" Arizona Republic.

Col. Ed Jones, responding to a March 2007 media query, confirmed that he had flown one of the aircraft in the formation that dropped flares on the night in question.<ref name=\"azcentral.com\"/> The squadron to which he belonged was in fact at [[Davis-Monthan AFB]], Arizona, on a training exercise at the time and flew training sorties to the Barry Goldwater Range on the night in question, according to the Maryland Air National Guard.

In Phoenix, a small number of local news outlets noted the event, but it received little attention beyond that. But on June 18, 1997, USA Today ran a front-page story that brought national attention to the case. This was followed by news coverage on the ABC and NBC television networks. The case quickly caught the popular imagination and has since become a staple of UFO-related documentary television, including specials produced by the History Channel and the Discovery Channel.\n\n===Governor===\n{{wikinews|Former Arizona Governor says he saw a UFO during the 1997 Phoenix Lights}}\nShortly after the lights, Arizona Governor [[Fife Symington III]] held a [[press conference]], stating that \"they found who was responsible\".

There were two distinct events involved in the incident: a triangular formation of lights seen to pass over the state, and a series of stationary lights seen in the Phoenix area.

As he was driving north, he allegedly saw a cluster of reddish or orange lights in the sky, comprising four lights together and a fifth light trailing them.

The object, or objects, which had been observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes with binoculars, then passed directly over the observers, were seen to \"Bank to the right\", and then disappeared in the night sky to the southeast of Prescott Valley.

I estimated the three light \"V\" to cover about 0.5 degrees of sky and the whole group of five lights to cover about 1 degree of sky.<ref>http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/002/S02076.html</ref>}}\n\n===Dewey===\nAt the town of [[Dewey, Arizona|Dewey]], 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) east of [[Prescott, Arizona]], six people saw a large cluster of lights while driving northbound on Highway 69.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===First sighting from Phoenix===\n{{unref|section|date=March 2019}}\nTim Ley and his wife Bobbi, his son Hal and his grandson Damien Turnidge first saw the lights when they were above [[Prescott Valley, Arizona|Prescott Valley]] about 65 miles (100&nbsp;km) away from them. At first, the lights appeared to them as five separate and distinct lights in an arc-shape, as if they were on top of a balloon, but they soon realized that the lights appeared to be moving towards them. Over the next ten or so minutes, the lights appeared to come closer, the distance between the lights increased, and they took on the shape of an upside down V. Eventually, when the lights appeared to be a couple of miles away, the witnesses could make out a shape that looked like a 60-degree [[carpenter's square]], with the five lights set into it, with one at the front and two on each side. Soon, the object with the embedded lights appeared to be coming right down the street where they lived, about 100 to 150 feet (30 to 45 meters) above them, traveling so slowly that it appeared to hover and was silent. The object then seemed to pass over their heads and went through a V opening in the peaks of the mountain range towards [[Piestewa Peak|Squaw Peak Mountain]] and toward the direction of [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Witnesses in Glendale, a suburb northwest of Phoenix, saw the object pass overhead at an altitude high enough to become obscured by the thin clouds; this was at approximately between 20:30 and 20:45 MST.\n\n===Arriving in Phoenix===\nWhen the triangular formation entered the Phoenix area, Bill Greiner, a cement driver hauling a load down a mountain north of Phoenix, described the second group of lights: \"I'll never be the same.  Before this, if anybody had told me they saw a UFO, I would've said, \"Yeah and I believe in the Tooth Fairy.\" \"Now I've got a whole new view and I may be just a dumb truck driver, but I've seen something that don't belong here.\"<ref name=\"phoenix\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spartechsoftware.com/dimensions/aliens/PhoenixLights.htm |title=Phoenix Lights |publisher=Spartechsoftware.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> Greiner stated that the lights hovered over the area for more than two hours.<ref>Hamilton, Bill.

Almost all known images are of the second event. All known images were produced using a variety of commercially available [[camcorders]] and [[cameras]]. There are no known images taken by equipment designed for scientific analysis, nor are there any known images taken using high powered optics or [[night vision]] equipment.\n\n===First event===\nThere are few known images of the Prescott/Dewey lights. Television station KSAZ reported that an individual named Richard Curtis recorded a detailed video that purportedly showed the outline of a space craft, but that the video had been lost. The only other known video is of poor quality and shows a group of lights with no craft visible.\n\n===Second event===\nDuring the Phoenix event, numerous still photographs and videotapes were made, distinctly showing a series of lights appearing at a regular interval, remaining illuminated for several moments and then going out. These images have been repeatedly aired by  documentary television channels such as the [[Discovery Channel]] and the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] as part of their UFO documentary programming. \n\nThe most frequently seen sequence shows what appears to be an arc of lights appearing one by one, then going out one by one. UFO advocates claim that these images show that the lights were some form of \"running light\" or other aircraft illumination along the leading edge of a large craft&nbsp;\u2014 estimated to be as large as a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) in diameter&nbsp;\u2014  hovering over the city of Phoenix. Other similar sequences reportedly taken over a half hour period show differing numbers of lights in a V or arrowhead array. Thousands of witnesses throughout Arizona also reported a silent, mile wide V or boomerang shaped craft with varying numbers of huge orbs. A significant number of witnesses reported that the craft was silently gliding directly overhead at low altitude. The first-hand witnesses consistently reported that the lights appeared as \"canisters of swimming light\", while the underbelly of the craft was undulating \"like looking through water\".<ref>Dateline NBC ''The Phoenix Lights'' http://msnbcecn.vo.llnwd.net/e1/video/flash/x_30_dtl_UFO1_080517.flv</ref> However, skeptics claim that the video is evidence that mountains not visible at night partially obstructed views from certain angles, thereby bolstering the claim that the lights were more distant than UFO advocates claim.<ref name=\"Hack\" />\n\nUFO advocate Jim Dilettoso claimed to have performed \"[[Spectroscopy|spectral analysis]]\" of photographs and video imagery that proved the lights could not have been produced by a man-made source. Dilettoso claimed to have used software called \"Image Pro Plus\" (exact version unknown) to determine the amount of red, green and blue in the various photographic and video images and construct histograms of the data, which were then compared to several photographs known to be of flares. Several sources have pointed out, however, that it is impossible to determine the spectral signature of a light source based solely on photographic or video imagery, as film and electronics inherently alter the spectral signature of a light source by shifting hue in the visible spectrum, and experts in spectroscopy have dismissed his claims as being scientifically invalid.<ref name=\"Hack\">{{cite news |last=Ortega |first=Tony |date=1998-03-05 |title=The Hack and the Quack |publisher=[[Phoenix New Times]] |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1998-03-05/news/the-hack-and-the-quack/ |accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref><ref name=\"skeptoid\">{{cite web |date= |title=The Alien Invasion of Phoenix, Arizona |publisher=Skeptoid.com |url=http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4041 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> Normal photographic equipment also eliminates light outside the visible spectrum&nbsp;\u2014 e.g., [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]]&nbsp;\u2014 that would be necessary for a complete spectral analysis. The maker of \"Image Pro Plus\", Media Cybernetic, has stated that its software is incapable of performing spectroscopic analysis.<ref name=\"Hack\"/>\n\nCognitech, an independent video laboratory, superimposed video imagery taken of the Phoenix Lights onto video imagery it shot during daytime from the same location. In the composite image, the lights are seen to extinguish at the moment they reach the [[Sierra Estrella|Estrella mountain range]], which is visible in the daytime, but invisible in the footage shot at night. A broadcast by local [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] affiliate [[KSAZ-TV]] claimed to have performed a similar test that showed the lights were in front of the mountain range and suggested that the Cognitech data might have been altered. Dr. Paul Scowen, visiting professor of Astronomy at [[Arizona State University]], performed a third analysis using daytime imagery overlaid with video shot of the lights and his findings were consistent with Cognitech. The ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' subsequently reported the television station had simply overlaid two video tracks on a video editing machine without using a computer to match the zoom and scale of the two images.<ref name=\"Hack\" />\n\n==Wind direction data==\nWind direction measured independently by several weather stations in the Phoenix area and archived by the [[National Centers for Environmental Information]] is consistent with reports about the movement of the lights. During the events, [[wind direction]] (origin) was changing from roughly west (i.e., blowing towards the east) to north (i.e., blowing towards the south). This supports the hypothesis that the flying objects were wind driven and could simply have been balloons (such as [[Sky lantern|sky lanterns]] or other [[Balloon-carried light effect|balloon-carried light effects]]) or flares.\n\n[[File:Phoenix, AZ - Wind direction (origin) on March 13-14 1997.svg|thumb|center|1000px| Wind direction in Phoenix, AZ on  March 13\u201314, 1997. '''Wind is reported by the direction from which it originates'''. Data courtesy of NOAA National Climate Data Center.]]\n\n==Explanations==\nThere is some controversy as to how best to classify the reports on the night in question. Some are of the opinion that the differing nature of the eyewitness reports indicates that several unidentified objects were in the area, each of which was its own separate \"event\". This is largely dismissed by skeptics as an over-extrapolation from the kind of deviation common in necessarily subjective eyewitness accounts. The media and most skeptical investigators have largely preferred to split the sightings into two distinct classes, a first and second event, for which two separate explanations are offered:\n\n===First event===\nThe first event&nbsp;\u2014 the \"V\", which appeared over northern Arizona and gradually traveled south over nearly the entire length of the state, eventually passing south of Tucson&nbsp;\u2014 was the apparently \"wedge-shaped\" object reported by then-Governor Symington and many others. This event started at about 20:15 MST over the Prescott area, and was seen south of Tucson by about 20:45 MST.\n\nProponents of two separate events propose that the first event still has no provable explanation, but that some evidence exists that the lights were in fact airplanes. According to an article by reporter Janet Gonzales that appeared in the ''[[Phoenix New Times]]'', videotape of the v shape shows the lights moving as separate entities, not as a single object; a phenomenon known as [[illusory contours]] can cause the human eye to see unconnected lines or dots as forming a single shape.  \n\nMitch Stanley, an amateur astronomer, observed high altitude lights flying in formation using a [[Dobsonian telescope]] giving 43x magnification. After observing the lights, he told his mother, who was present at the time, that the lights were aircraft.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ortega |first=Tony |date=1997-06-26 |title=The Great UFO Coverup |publisher=[[Phoenix New Times]] |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1997-06-26/news/the-great-ufo-cover-up/ |accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref> According to Stanley, the lights were quite clearly individual airplanes; a companion who was with him recalled asking Stanley at the time what the lights were, and he said, \"Planes\". When Stanley first gave an account of his observation at the Discovery Channel Town Hall Meeting with all the witnesses there he was shouted down in his assertion that what he saw was what other witnesses saw. Obviously Stanley was seeing the Maryland National Guard jets flying in formation on their way to drop high-altitude flares at the Barry M. Goldwater bombing range south of Phoenix. His account as to the nature of the lights that moved in formation that night is contradicted by some Phoenix residents without high powered telescopes, however, and no military or civilian aircraft formations were known to have been flying in the area at that time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Of course, the Maryland National Guard jets were not known about at that time because their mission was a classified military mission.\n\nAdditionally, [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] includes the western campus of [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] where flight training occurs with a large fleet of light aircraft. An additional whispered theory on campus is that the aircraft in formation were ERAU aircraft flying in formation with transponders and lights off as a prank. It is treated as an open secret as such behavior is a severe violation of FAA and ERAU rules.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Second event===\nThe second event was the set of nine lights appearing to \"hover\" over the city of Phoenix at around 10 pm. The second event has been more thoroughly covered by the media, due in part to the numerous video images taken of the lights. This was also observed by numerous people who may have thought they were seeing the same lights as those reported earlier.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force explained the second event as slow-falling, long-burning LUU-2B/B illumination [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|flares]] dropped by a flight of four [[A-10 Warthog]] aircraft on a training exercise at the Barry Goldwater Range at Western Pima county. According to this explanation, the flares would have been visible in Phoenix and appeared to hover due to rising heat from the burning flares creating a \"balloon\" effect on their parachutes, which slowed the descent.<ref name=\"azcentral.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/0225phxlights0225.html |title=Craven, Scott. \"Intrigue persists over lights in sky.\" Arizona Republic.

Col. Ed Jones, responding to a March 2007 media query, confirmed that he had flown one of the aircraft in the formation that dropped flares on the night in question.<ref name=\"azcentral.com\"/> The squadron to which he belonged was in fact at [[Davis-Monthan AFB]], Arizona, on a training exercise at the time and flew training sorties to the Barry Goldwater Range on the night in question, according to the Maryland Air National Guard.

In Phoenix, a small number of local news outlets noted the event, but it received little attention beyond that. But on June 18, 1997, USA Today ran a front-page story that brought national attention to the case. This was followed by news coverage on the ABC and NBC television networks. The case quickly caught the popular imagination and has since become a staple of UFO-related documentary television, including specials produced by the History Channel and the Discovery Channel.\n\n===Governor===\n{{wikinews|Former Arizona Governor says he saw a UFO during the 1997 Phoenix Lights}}\nShortly after the lights, Arizona Governor [[Fife Symington III]] held a [[press conference]], stating that \"they found who was responsible\". He proceeded to make light of the situation by bringing his aide on stage dressed in an alien costume.
