The UK's [[National Nuclear Laboratory]] has its Central Laboratory and headquarters on the site.\n\nOriginally built as a Royal Ordnance Factory in 1942, the site briefly passed into the ownership of [[Courtaulds]] for [[rayon]] manufacture following [[WW2]], but was re-acquired by the [[Ministry of Supply]] in 1947 for the production of [[plutonium]] for nuclear weapons, and was given the name \"Windscale Works\". Subsequent key developments include the building of Calder Hall nuclear power station, the [[b205|Magnox fuel reprocessing plant]], the prototype [[Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor]] (AGR) and the [[Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant]] (THORP).\n\nCurrent (2019) activities at the Sellafield site are primarily decommissioning of historic plants, and reprocessing of spent fuel from UK and international nuclear reactors which will completely cease when the Magnox fuel reprocessing plant closes in 2020.

Construction of the nuclear facilities commenced in September 1947 and the site was renamed Windscale Works. The building of the nuclear plant was a huge construction project, requiring a peak effort of 5,000 workers. The two air-cooled and open-circuit, [[graphite]]-moderated Windscale reactors (the \"[[Windscale Piles]]\") and the associated first generation reprocessing plant, producing the first British weapons grade [[plutonium-239]] were central to the UK nuclear weapons programme of the 1950s.\n\nWindscale Pile No. 1 became operational in October 1950, just over three years from the start of construction, and Pile No. 2 became operational in June 1951. Later in 1957 Pile 1 suffered a major accident; the [[Windscale fire]], the worst nuclear accident in UK history, ranked in severity at level 5 out of a possible 7 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].\n\n===Calder Hall power station===\n[[File:Calder Hall, Queen opening.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] officially opening Calder Hall nuclear power station on 17 October 1956]]\nWith the creation of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) in 1954, ownership of Windscale Works passed to the UKAEA. The first of four [[Magnox]] reactors became operational in 1956 at Calder Hall, a site \nextension across the River Calder, and the whole site became known as Windscale and Calder Works.\n\n===British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL)===\nFollowing the break-up of the UKAEA into a research division (UKAEA) and a newly-created company for nuclear production [[British Nuclear Fuels Ltd]] (BNFL) in 1971, a major part of the site was transferred to BNFL ownership and management. In 1981 BNFL's Windscale and Calder Works was renamed Sellafield as part of a major reorganisation of the site and there was a consolidation of management under one head of the entire BNFL Sellafield site. The remainder of the site remained in the hands of the UKAEA and was still called Windscale.<ref>Cassidy, Nick, and Patrick Green. 1993. ''Sellafield: The contaminated legacy''.

Construction of the nuclear facilities commenced in September 1947 and the site was renamed Windscale Works. The building of the nuclear plant was a huge construction project, requiring a peak effort of 5,000 workers. The two air-cooled and open-circuit, [[graphite]]-moderated Windscale reactors (the \"[[Windscale Piles]]\") and the associated first generation reprocessing plant, producing the first British weapons grade [[plutonium-239]] were central to the UK nuclear weapons programme of the 1950s.\n\nWindscale Pile No. 1 became operational in October 1950, just over three years from the start of construction, and Pile No. 2 became operational in June 1951. Later in 1957 Pile 1 suffered a major accident; the [[Windscale fire]], the worst nuclear accident in UK history, ranked in severity at level 5 out of a possible 7 on the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].\n\n===Calder Hall power station===\n[[File:Calder Hall, Queen opening.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] officially opening Calder Hall nuclear power station on 17 October 1956]]\nWith the creation of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) in 1954, ownership of Windscale Works passed to the UKAEA. The first of four [[Magnox]] reactors became operational in 1956 at Calder Hall, a site \nextension across the River Calder, and the whole site became known as Windscale and Calder Works.\n\n===British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL)===\nFollowing the break-up of the UKAEA into a research division (UKAEA) and a newly-created company for nuclear production [[British Nuclear Fuels Ltd]] (BNFL) in 1971, a major part of the site was transferred to BNFL ownership and management. In 1981 BNFL's Windscale and Calder Works was renamed Sellafield as part of a major reorganisation of the site and there was a consolidation of management under one head of the entire BNFL Sellafield site. The remainder of the site remained in the hands of the UKAEA and was still called Windscale.<ref>Cassidy, Nick, and Patrick Green. 1993. ''Sellafield: The contaminated legacy''.

sea, using a [[flocculation]] process to remove radioactivity from liquid effluent before discharge. Metals dissolved in acidic effluents were made to produce a metal hydroxide flocculant [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] following the addition of [[ammonium hydroxide]]. The suspension was then transferred to settling tanks where the precipitate would settle out, and the remaining clarified liquid, or [[supernate]], would be discharged to the [[Irish Sea]]. As an improvement to that process, in 1994 the Enhanced Actinide Removal Plant (EARP) became operational.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In EARP the effectiveness of the process is enhanced by the addition of reagents to remove the remaining soluble radioactive species. EARP was enhanced further in 2004 to further reduce the quantities of [[technetium-99]] released to the environment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Treating a 50-year-old legacy of radioactive sludge waste |author=Ben Irons |work=Engineer Live |url=http://www.engineerlive.com/power-engineer/nuclear-power/14432/treating-a-50yearold-legacy-of-radioactive-sludge-waste.thtml |accessdate=21 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126051749/http://www.engineerlive.com/power-engineer/nuclear-power/14432/treating-a-50yearold-legacy-of-radioactive-sludge-waste.thtml |archivedate=26 January 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Radioactive waste stores===\nSellafield has a number of radioactive waste stores, mostly working on an interim basis while a [[deep geological repository]] plan is developed and implemented.\n\nThe stores include:\n<ref name=\"NDA-site-summary-2006\">{{cite report |url=http://www.nda.gov.uk/documents/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&pageid=4007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110103707/http://www.nda.gov.uk/documents/loader.cfm?url=%2Fcommonspot%2Fsecurity%2Fgetfile.cfm&pageid=4007 |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 November 2007 |title=Sellafield Site Summary \u2013 2006/07 Lifetime Plan (Rev.

The solar panels, power subsystem, attitude control subsystem, and the computer kept the spacecraft operating properly during the flight. The navigational system, including the hydrazine rocket, would keep ''Mariner 10'' on track to Venus and Mercury. Several scientific instruments would collect data at the two planets. Finally, the antennas would transmit this data to the [[Deep Space Network]] back on Earth, as well as receive commands from Mission Control. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s various components and scientific instruments were attached to a central hub, which was roughly the shape of an octagonal prism.

Due to Mercury's proximity to the Sun, ''Mariner 10'' would have to endure 4.5 times more [[solar radiation]] than when it departed Earth; compared to previous Mariner missions, spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat. Thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body. After evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material, mission planners chose [[beta cloth]], a combination of aluminized [[Kapton]] and glass-fiber sheets treated with [[Teflon]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 32\u201333</ref> However, solar shielding was unfeasible for some of ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s other components. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s two solar panels needed to be kept under 115 \u00b0C. Covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity. The solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels, so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed. Engineers considered folding the panels toward each other, making a V-shape with the main body, but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft. The alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis, which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecraft's nitrogen jet thrusters, which could now be placed on the panel tips. The panels could be rotated a maximum of 76\u00b0.<ref name=\"Strom16\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 16</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 21</ref> Additionally, ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the Sun to function properly, but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution. Instead, a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 30\u201332</ref>\n\nAccurately performing the gravity assist at Venus posed another hurdle.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 242</ref> If ''Mariner 10'' was to maintain a course to Mercury, its trajectory could deviate no more than {{convert|200|km}} from a critical point in the vicinity of Venus.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 56</ref> To ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made, mission planners tripled the amount of [[hydrazine]] fuel Mariner 10 would carry, and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous Mariner mission had held. These upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third Mercury flybys.<ref name=\"MB25\">Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nThe mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard: a sister spacecraft. It was common for probes to be launched in pairs, with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other.<ref>Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 14</ref> The budget constraint ruled this option out. Even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft, the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time. In the event that Mariner 10 failed, NASA would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixed; this would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on 3 November 1973 and the last possible launch date of 21 November 1973.<ref name=\"MB25\"/><ref name=\"MB38\"/> (The unused backup was sent to the Smithsonian museum)\n\n== Instruments ==\n[[Image:Mariner10.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration showing the instruments of ''Mariner 10''.]]\n\n''Mariner 10'' conducted seven experiments at Venus and Mercury.

To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of -40 \u00b0C; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight. Test photos of the Earth and Moon showed that image quality had not been significantly affected.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 43\u201348</ref> The mission team was pleasantly surprised when the camera heaters started working on 17 January 1974, two months after launch.<ref>{{cite journal|editor-last=Clark|editor-first=Pamela|authorlink=|title=Mariner 10: A Retrospective|journal=Mercury Messenger|volume=|issue=10|pages= |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|location=|date=December 2003|language=|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/newsletters/mercmessenger/issue10.pdf|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm= |accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"No. 14\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 14: TCM-2 Performance Superb TV Heaters Have Come On|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=23 January 1974|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-14.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Later investigation concluded that a short circuit in a different location on the probe had prevented the heater from turning on.

The temporary orbit took the spacecraft one-third of the distance around Earth: this maneuver was needed to reach the correct spot for a second burn by the Centaur engines, which set ''Mariner 10'' on a path towards Venus. The probe then separated from the rocket; subsequently, the Centaur stage diverted away to avoid the possibility of a future collision. Never before had a planetary mission depended upon two separate rocket burns during the launch, and even with ''Mariner 10'', scientists initially viewed the maneuver as too risky.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowles|first=Mark D.|authorlink=\n|title=Taming Liquid Hydrogen: The Centaur Upper Stage Rocket 1958-2002|publisher=Government Printing Office|series=|volume=|edition=|date=2004|location=Washington D.C.|pages=131\u2013133|language= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSxO3zHjCuAC&pg=PA131|doi=|id=|isbn=9780160877391|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref><ref>Dunne and Burgess 1977, pp. 45-46</ref>\n\nDuring its first week of flight, the ''Mariner 10'' camera system was tested by taking five [[Panoramic photography|photographic mosaics]] of the [[Earth]] and six of the [[Moon]].

Immediately afterward, the star-tracker locked onto a bright flake of paint which had come off the spacecraft and lost tracking on the guide star [[Canopus]]. An automated safety protocol recovered Canopus, but the problem of flaking paint recurred throughout the mission. The on-board computer also experienced unscheduled resets occasionally, which necessitated reconfiguring the clock sequence and subsystems. Periodic problems with the high-gain antenna also occurred during the cruise. On 8 January 1974, a malfunction thought to be caused by a short-circuited diode occurred in the power subsystem.<ref name=\"Paul\"/> As a result, the main booster regulator and inverter failed, leaving the spacecraft dependent on the redundant regulator.

Due to Mercury's proximity to the Sun, ''Mariner 10'' would have to endure 4.5 times more [[solar radiation]] than when it departed Earth; compared to previous Mariner missions, spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat. Thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body. After evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material, mission planners chose [[beta cloth]], a combination of aluminized [[Kapton]] and glass-fiber sheets treated with [[Teflon]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 32\u201333</ref> However, solar shielding was unfeasible for some of ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s other components. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s two solar panels needed to be kept under 115 \u00b0C. Covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity. The solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels, so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed. Engineers considered folding the panels toward each other, making a V-shape with the main body, but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft. The alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis, which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecraft's nitrogen jet thrusters, which could now be placed on the panel tips. The panels could be rotated a maximum of 76\u00b0.<ref name=\"Strom16\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 16</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 21</ref> Additionally, ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the Sun to function properly, but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution. Instead, a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 30\u201332</ref>\n\nAccurately performing the gravity assist at Venus posed another hurdle.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 242</ref> If ''Mariner 10'' was to maintain a course to Mercury, its trajectory could deviate no more than {{convert|200|km}} from a critical point in the vicinity of Venus.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 56</ref> To ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made, mission planners tripled the amount of [[hydrazine]] fuel Mariner 10 would carry, and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous Mariner mission had held. These upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third Mercury flybys.<ref name=\"MB25\">Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nThe mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard: a sister spacecraft. It was common for probes to be launched in pairs, with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other.<ref>Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 14</ref> The budget constraint ruled this option out. Even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft, the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time. In the event that Mariner 10 failed, NASA would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixed; this would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on 3 November 1973 and the last possible launch date of 21 November 1973.<ref name=\"MB25\"/><ref name=\"MB38\"/> (The unused backup was sent to the Smithsonian museum)\n\n== Instruments ==\n[[Image:Mariner10.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration showing the instruments of ''Mariner 10''.]]\n\n''Mariner 10'' conducted seven experiments at Venus and Mercury.

To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of -40 \u00b0C; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight. Test photos of the Earth and Moon showed that image quality had not been significantly affected.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 43\u201348</ref> The mission team was pleasantly surprised when the camera heaters started working on 17 January 1974, two months after launch.<ref>{{cite journal|editor-last=Clark|editor-first=Pamela|authorlink=|title=Mariner 10: A Retrospective|journal=Mercury Messenger|volume=|issue=10|pages= |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|location=|date=December 2003|language=|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/newsletters/mercmessenger/issue10.pdf|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm= |accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"No. 14\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 14: TCM-2 Performance Superb TV Heaters Have Come On|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=23 January 1974|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-14.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Later investigation concluded that a short circuit in a different location on the probe had prevented the heater from turning on.

The probe then separated from the rocket; subsequently, the Centaur stage diverted away to avoid the possibility of a future collision.

An automated safety protocol recovered Canopus, but the problem of flaking paint recurred throughout the mission. The on-board computer also experienced unscheduled resets occasionally, which necessitated reconfiguring the clock sequence and subsystems.

A [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Award]] and two-time [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nominee, she also played the regular role of Rhetta Rodriguez on the [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] drama ''[[Saving Grace (TV series)|Saving Grace]]'' (2007\u20132010), and the recurring role of Dr. [[Grace Confalone]] on the [[CBS]] drama ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' (2016\u201319).\n\n==Early life and education==\nSan Giacomo, an [[Italian American]],<ref name=\"book1\">{{cite book|last=Stock|first=Ann Marie|authorlink=|title=Framing Latin American Cinema: contemporary critical perspectives|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1997|location=Minnesota|pages=XXVI|url=https://archive.org/details/framinglatinamer0000unse|isbn=0-8166-2972-2|nopp=true}}</ref> was born in [[West Orange, New Jersey]], the daughter of MaryJo and John San Giacomo, a [[paper mill]] owner.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/8/Laura-San-Giacomo.html | title=Laura San Giacomo Biographyggg (1962?-) | publisher=FilmReference.com}}</ref> She grew up in [[Denville, New Jersey]]. San Giacomo discovered acting while attending [[Morris Knolls High School]]. In 1984, she received a fine arts degree, specializing in acting, from [[Carnegie Mellon School of Drama]] in [[Pittsburgh]].\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduating, she moved to New York. San Giacomo then went on to appear in several theater productions, including the [[Garry Marshall]]-[[Lowell Ganz]] production of ''Wrong Turn at Lungfish'' in Los Angeles, the Princeton/McCarter Theatre production of ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'', and off-Broadway in ''Beirut''. She also starred in ''[[Italian American Reconciliation]]'', regional productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', as well as ''[[Crimes of the Heart]]''. In a review of the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] 1986 presentation of ''As You Like It'', San Giacomo received a special mention: \"although doll-like Laura San Giacomo had only a minor role as a wilful shepherdess, she sank her fangs into it and received the only show-interrupting applause of the evening.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.philly.com/1986-03-13/entertainment/26084264_1_lighting-true-love-maureen-garrett | title=As You Like It: Try It | first=Stuart D.|last=Bykofsky | work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] | publisher=[[Philadelphia News Network]]|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|date=March 13, 1986 }}</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nSan Giacomo's first television appearances were four episodes on three television series during 1987.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{IMDb name|0000624}}</ref>  Two notable appearances were in ''[[Crime Story (U.S. TV series)|Crime Story]]'' in 1988 for the episode \"Protected Witness\" (Season 2 / Episode 13) as Theresa Farantino, and in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' in 1989 for the episode, \"Leap of Faith\" (Season 5, Episode 19) as Tania Lewis. The ''Miami Vice'' episode also featured a guest appearance by her future husband, actor [[Cameron Dye]], one year before their marriage. Prior to that, she was featured on the daytime soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'' as Louisa Sanchez, the Latina common-law wife of Mitch Beck (Brian Fitzpatrick) whose presence threatened to thwart his relationship with Hillary Martin ([[Carmen Thomas]]).\n\nHowever, San Giacomo first drew international attention in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' (1989), which also marked her film debut as a credited actor (in the 1988 movie ''[[Miles from Home]]'', her role as \"Sandy\" was not credited).<ref name=\"imdb\" /> Her work in the film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and she received a [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] ''New Generation Award''. The film was honored with the [[Cannes Film Festival]]'s prestigious Grand Prize, the [[Palme d'Or]].\n\nIn 1990, San Giacomo played a supporting role as [[Julia Roberts]]'s character's wisecracking friend Kit De Luca in ''[[Pretty Woman]]''. The [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film ended up generating $178 million at the [[box office]].<ref>{{Mojo title|id=prettywoman|title=Pretty Woman}}</ref>\n\nSan Giacomo has appeared in such films as ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'' (1990), ''Vital Signs'' (1990), ''[[Under Suspicion (1991 film)|Under Suspicion]]'' (1991), ''[[Once Around]]'' (1991), ''[[Where the Day Takes You]]'' (1992), ''Nina Takes a Lover'' (1994), and ''[[Suicide Kings]]'' (1997). She also appeared as [[List of The Stand characters#Nadine Cross|Nadine Cross]] in the [[Stephen King]] [[TV miniseries]] ''[[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|The Stand]]'' opposite [[Rob Lowe]], which landed them on the cover of the May 7\u201313, 1994, issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''. She continued doing films, and as 1999 ended, she did the film ''[[Eat Your Heart Out (film)|Eat Your Heart Out]]''. In 2001, San Giacomo landed the starring role in the [[Jenifer Estess]] [[bio-pic]] ''Jenifer'', which aired on [[CBS]] in October of that year.\n\nSan Giacomo did voice work for the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' (as the character of [[Fox (animated character)|Fox]]). However, she went uncredited for the role because her agent believed it would damage her reputation to have worked on an animated series.\n\n===''Just Shoot Me!''===\n{{Main|Just Shoot Me!}}\nNeeding to work, but not wanting to be away from her newborn son for months at a time, San Giacomo shifted to television in the role of hot-tempered, sassy journalist [[Maya Gallo]] in the [[situation comedy]] ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' (1997\u20132003).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Just-Shoot-Season-3/10949 |title=Laura San Giacomo interview by Chet Cooper |publisher=abilitymagazine.com |accessdate=2012-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916045406/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Just-Shoot-Season-3/10949 |archivedate=2011-09-16 }}</ref> Her character was partially based on an unproduced idea that executive producer [[Steven Levitan]] once had in mind for actress [[Janeane Garofalo]] when he was a writer for ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. San Giacomo was originally cast in the starring role, since the series was meant to center on her character; however, the show soon adopted an ensemble style. Despite the shift in focus, San Giacomo remained an integral part of the show and with top billing. She and the four other main cast members appeared in all 148 episodes of the series, which lasted until 2003.\n\nSan Giacomo's work during Season 2 (1997\u20131998) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination in 1998 for [[List of Golden Globe Awards: Television, Best Actress, Comedy/Musical|Best Actress in a Television Comedy or Musical]]; the award went to ''[[Ally McBeal|Ally McBeal's]]'' [[Calista Flockhart]].\n\n===Post-''Just Shoot Me!'' and appearances===\nAfter NBC cancelled ''Just Shoot Me!'' in 2003, San Giacomo appeared sporadically on television and in films. She made guest appearances on several television series, including the short-lived [[CBS]] crime drama ''[[The Handler (TV series)|The Handler]]'' in 2003 and [[HBO]]'s ''[[Unscripted]]'' in 2005. She was the narrator for the [[true crime]] series ''Snapped: Killer Couples'' on [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]]. San Giacomo also appeared in the 2005 films ''[[Checking Out (2005 film)|Checking Out]]'' and ''[[Havoc (2005 film)|Havoc]]'', as well as the 2006 film ''Conquistadora''. San Giacomo was to have made her return to television on [[The WB Television Network|The WB's]] new drama ''[[Related]]'' in 2005, but the character was recast due to creative differences. [[Kiele Sanchez]] took her place as \"Anne Sorelli\" on the show. San Giacomo also made few public appearances; she made her first public appearance in nearly a year on 19 October 2005 at the ''15th Annual Environmental Media Awards''.  She made two more public appearances at the ''Crystal and Lucy Awards'' on 6 June 2006 and at the ''3rd Annual [[Alfred E. Mann|Alfred Mann]] Foundation Innovation and Inspiration Gala'' on 9 September 2006.\n\nIn 2006, San Giacomo returned to network television with three guest appearances on the third season of ''[[Veronica Mars]]''. She reunited with her former [[love interest]] from ''Just Shoot Me!'', [[Enrico Colantoni]], playing Harmony Chase. Both Colantoni and San Giacomo enjoyed their reunion so much that they lobbied for their characters to appear together in further episodes.<ref>[http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-story-laurasangiacomo-veronicamars,0,2855432.story Former 'Just Shoot Me' Stars Enjoy Life on 'Mars' \u2013 Laura San Giacomo and Enrico Colantoni reunite on CW drama \u2013 Zap2it] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926125445/http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-story-laurasangiacomo-veronicamars%2C0%2C2855432.story |date=2012-09-26 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, San Giacomo secured her first starring role on a television program after ''Just Shoot Me!'', when she reunited with a former peer and co-starred opposite fellow Carnegie-Mellon alum [[Holly Hunter]] in [[Turner Network Television|TNT's]] [[drama]] series ''[[Saving Grace (TV Series)|Saving Grace]]''. San Giacomo played Grace's best friend Rhetta Rodriguez.\n\nIn June 2010, San Giacomo guest starred in the episode titled \"Death Becomes Her\" on the [[USA Network|USA network's]] ''[[In Plain Sight]]''. She played a woman from an organized crime family with a terminal illness. In December 2011, San Giacomo appeared on the episode titled \"Beards\" on ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', as Caroline, Melanie's estranged sister.\n\n== Personal life ==\nSan Giacomo has been married twice, first to actor [[Cameron Dye]] (1990\u20131998), with whom she had a son, Mason Dye (b. November 19, 1995), who has [[cerebral palsy]], and second to actor [[Matt Adler]] (m. 2000).\nSan Giacomo is a cousin of [[Torry Castellano]], former drummer of the rock group [[The Donnas]].\n\nShe lives in the [[San Fernando Valley]], [[California]]. Her hobbies include horseback riding, gymnastics, ice skating, ballet, tennis, golf and playing piano.\n\nSan Giacomo is a strong supporter of charitable causes, most prominently those related to [[disabilities]]. She has appeared at the [[Environmental Media Awards]], the \"Voices For Change\" gala benefit and concert which benefits Children with Disabilities, and the \"Friends Finding a Cure\" gala benefiting Project [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]. She is also a founder of the CHIME Charter Elementary School, an [[elementary school]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], California. Chime is an inclusion school for all children of all abilities. The school opened its doors in 2001. As a charter school, CHIME provides free [[public education]] to students and admits them through a lottery system. The school serves approximately 200 children in [[kindergarten]] through fifth grade who live in communities around California's [[San Fernando Valley]].<ref>[http://www.ed.gov/news/newsletters/innovator/2005/0509.html Archived: The Education Innovator-9 May 2005]</ref> Today CHIME services grade kindergarten through eighth grade and has almost 700 students.\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  width=\"100%\"\n!

A [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Award]] and two-time [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] nominee, she also played the regular role of Rhetta Rodriguez on the [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] drama ''[[Saving Grace (TV series)|Saving Grace]]'' (2007\u20132010), and the recurring role of Dr. Grace Confalone on the [[CBS]] drama ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' (2016\u201319).\n\n==Early life and education==\nSan Giacomo, an [[Italian American]],<ref name=\"book1\">{{cite book|last=Stock|first=Ann Marie|authorlink=|title=Framing Latin American Cinema: contemporary critical perspectives|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1997|location=Minnesota|pages=XXVI|url=https://archive.org/details/framinglatinamer0000unse|isbn=0-8166-2972-2|nopp=true}}</ref> was born in [[West Orange, New Jersey]], the daughter of MaryJo and John San Giacomo, a [[paper mill]] owner.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/8/Laura-San-Giacomo.html | title=Laura San Giacomo Biographyggg (1962?-) | publisher=FilmReference.com}}</ref> She grew up in [[Denville, New Jersey]]. San Giacomo discovered acting while attending [[Morris Knolls High School]]. In 1984, she received a fine arts degree, specializing in acting, from [[Carnegie Mellon School of Drama]] in [[Pittsburgh]].\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduating, she moved to New York. San Giacomo then went on to appear in several theater productions, including the [[Garry Marshall]]-[[Lowell Ganz]] production of ''Wrong Turn at Lungfish'' in Los Angeles, the Princeton/McCarter Theatre production of ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'', and off-Broadway in ''Beirut''. She also starred in ''[[Italian American Reconciliation]]'', regional productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest]]'', ''[[As You Like It]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', as well as ''[[Crimes of the Heart]]''. In a review of the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] 1986 presentation of ''As You Like It'', San Giacomo received a special mention: \"although doll-like Laura San Giacomo had only a minor role as a wilful shepherdess, she sank her fangs into it and received the only show-interrupting applause of the evening.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.philly.com/1986-03-13/entertainment/26084264_1_lighting-true-love-maureen-garrett | title=As You Like It: Try It | first=Stuart D.|last=Bykofsky | work=[[Philadelphia Daily News]] | publisher=[[Philadelphia News Network]]|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|date=March 13, 1986 }}</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nSan Giacomo's first television appearances were four episodes on three television series during 1987.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{IMDb name|0000624}}</ref>  Two notable appearances were in ''[[Crime Story (U.S. TV series)|Crime Story]]'' in 1988 for the episode \"Protected Witness\" (Season 2 / Episode 13) as Theresa Farantino, and in ''[[Miami Vice]]'' in 1989 for the episode, \"Leap of Faith\" (Season 5, Episode 19) as Tania Lewis. The ''Miami Vice'' episode also featured a guest appearance by her future husband, actor [[Cameron Dye]], one year before their marriage. Prior to that, she was featured on the daytime soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'' as Louisa Sanchez, the Latina common-law wife of Mitch Beck (Brian Fitzpatrick) whose presence threatened to thwart his relationship with Hillary Martin ([[Carmen Thomas]]).\n\nHowever, San Giacomo first drew international attention in [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' (1989), which also marked her film debut as a credited actor (in the 1988 movie ''[[Miles from Home]]'', her role as \"Sandy\" was not credited).<ref name=\"imdb\" /> Her work in the film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and she received a [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]] ''New Generation Award''. The film was honored with the [[Cannes Film Festival]]'s prestigious Grand Prize, the [[Palme d'Or]].\n\nIn 1990, San Giacomo played a supporting role as [[Julia Roberts]]'s character's wisecracking friend Kit De Luca in ''[[Pretty Woman]]''. The [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film ended up generating $178 million at the [[box office]].<ref>{{Mojo title|id=prettywoman|title=Pretty Woman}}</ref>\n\nSan Giacomo has appeared in such films as ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'' (1990), ''Vital Signs'' (1990), ''[[Under Suspicion (1991 film)|Under Suspicion]]'' (1991), ''[[Once Around]]'' (1991), ''[[Where the Day Takes You]]'' (1992), ''Nina Takes a Lover'' (1994), and ''[[Suicide Kings]]'' (1997). She also appeared as [[List of The Stand characters#Nadine Cross|Nadine Cross]] in the [[Stephen King]] [[TV miniseries]] ''[[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|The Stand]]'' opposite [[Rob Lowe]], which landed them on the cover of the May 7\u201313, 1994, issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''. She continued doing films, and as 1999 ended, she did the film ''[[Eat Your Heart Out (film)|Eat Your Heart Out]]''. In 2001, San Giacomo landed the starring role in the [[Jenifer Estess]] [[bio-pic]] ''Jenifer'', which aired on [[CBS]] in October of that year.\n\nSan Giacomo did voice work for the animated series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' (as the character of [[Fox (animated character)|Fox]]). However, she went uncredited for the role because her agent believed it would damage her reputation to have worked on an animated series.\n\n===''Just Shoot Me!''===\n{{Main|Just Shoot Me!}}\nNeeding to work, but not wanting to be away from her newborn son for months at a time, San Giacomo shifted to television in the role of hot-tempered, sassy journalist [[Maya Gallo]] in the [[situation comedy]] ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]'' (1997\u20132003).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Just-Shoot-Season-3/10949 |title=Laura San Giacomo interview by Chet Cooper |publisher=abilitymagazine.com |accessdate=2012-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916045406/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Just-Shoot-Season-3/10949 |archivedate=2011-09-16 }}</ref> Her character was partially based on an unproduced idea that executive producer [[Steven Levitan]] once had in mind for actress [[Janeane Garofalo]] when he was a writer for ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''. San Giacomo was originally cast in the starring role, since the series was meant to center on her character; however, the show soon adopted an ensemble style. Despite the shift in focus, San Giacomo remained an integral part of the show and with top billing. She and the four other main cast members appeared in all 148 episodes of the series, which lasted until 2003.\n\nSan Giacomo's work during Season 2 (1997\u20131998) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination in 1998 for [[List of Golden Globe Awards: Television, Best Actress, Comedy/Musical|Best Actress in a Television Comedy or Musical]]; the award went to ''[[Ally McBeal|Ally McBeal's]]'' [[Calista Flockhart]].\n\n===Post-''Just Shoot Me!'' and appearances===\nAfter NBC cancelled ''Just Shoot Me!'' in 2003, San Giacomo appeared sporadically on television and in films. She made guest appearances on several television series, including the short-lived [[CBS]] crime drama ''[[The Handler (TV series)|The Handler]]'' in 2003 and [[HBO]]'s ''[[Unscripted]]'' in 2005. She was the narrator for the [[true crime]] series ''Snapped: Killer Couples'' on [[Oxygen (TV channel)|Oxygen]]. San Giacomo also appeared in the 2005 films ''[[Checking Out (2005 film)|Checking Out]]'' and ''[[Havoc (2005 film)|Havoc]]'', as well as the 2006 film ''Conquistadora''. San Giacomo was to have made her return to television on [[The WB Television Network|The WB's]] new drama ''[[Related]]'' in 2005, but the character was recast due to creative differences. [[Kiele Sanchez]] took her place as \"Anne Sorelli\" on the show. San Giacomo also made few public appearances; she made her first public appearance in nearly a year on 19 October 2005 at the ''15th Annual Environmental Media Awards''.  She made two more public appearances at the ''Crystal and Lucy Awards'' on 6 June 2006 and at the ''3rd Annual [[Alfred E. Mann|Alfred Mann]] Foundation Innovation and Inspiration Gala'' on 9 September 2006.\n\nIn 2006, San Giacomo returned to network television with three guest appearances on the third season of ''[[Veronica Mars]]''. She reunited with her former [[love interest]] from ''Just Shoot Me!'', [[Enrico Colantoni]], playing Harmony Chase. Both Colantoni and San Giacomo enjoyed their reunion so much that they lobbied for their characters to appear together in further episodes.<ref>[http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-story-laurasangiacomo-veronicamars,0,2855432.story Former 'Just Shoot Me' Stars Enjoy Life on 'Mars' \u2013 Laura San Giacomo and Enrico Colantoni reunite on CW drama \u2013 Zap2it] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926125445/http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-story-laurasangiacomo-veronicamars%2C0%2C2855432.story |date=2012-09-26 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 2006, San Giacomo secured her first starring role on a television program after ''Just Shoot Me!'', when she reunited with a former peer and co-starred opposite fellow Carnegie-Mellon alum [[Holly Hunter]] in [[Turner Network Television|TNT's]] [[drama]] series ''[[Saving Grace (TV Series)|Saving Grace]]''. San Giacomo played Grace's best friend Rhetta Rodriguez.\n\nIn June 2010, San Giacomo guest starred in the episode titled \"Death Becomes Her\" on the [[USA Network|USA network's]] ''[[In Plain Sight]]''. She played a woman from an organized crime family with a terminal illness. In December 2011, San Giacomo appeared on the episode titled \"Beards\" on ''[[Hot in Cleveland]]'', as Caroline, Melanie's estranged sister.\n\n== Personal life ==\nSan Giacomo has been married twice, first to actor [[Cameron Dye]] (1990\u20131998), with whom she had a son, Mason Dye (b. November 19, 1995), who has [[cerebral palsy]], and second to actor [[Matt Adler]] (m. 2000).\nSan Giacomo is a cousin of [[Torry Castellano]], former drummer of the rock group [[The Donnas]].\n\nShe lives in the [[San Fernando Valley]], [[California]]. Her hobbies include horseback riding, gymnastics, ice skating, ballet, tennis, golf and playing piano.\n\nSan Giacomo is a strong supporter of charitable causes, most prominently those related to [[disabilities]]. She has appeared at the [[Environmental Media Awards]], the \"Voices For Change\" gala benefit and concert which benefits Children with Disabilities, and the \"Friends Finding a Cure\" gala benefiting Project [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]. She is also a founder of the CHIME Charter Elementary School, an [[elementary school]] in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], California. Chime is an inclusion school for all children of all abilities. The school opened its doors in 2001. As a charter school, CHIME provides free [[public education]] to students and admits them through a lottery system. The school serves approximately 200 children in [[kindergarten]] through fifth grade who live in communities around California's [[San Fernando Valley]].<ref>[http://www.ed.gov/news/newsletters/innovator/2005/0509.html Archived: The Education Innovator-9 May 2005]</ref> Today CHIME services grade kindergarten through eighth grade and has almost 700 students.\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  width=\"100%\"\n!

For example, on the real line, the Poisson process, both homogeneous  or inhomogeneous, is sometimes interpreted as a counting process, and the notation  <math>\\textstyle \\{N(t), t\\geq 0\\}</math> is used to represent the Poisson process.<ref name=\"Tijms2003page1\"/><ref name=\"Ross1996page59\"/>\n\nAnother reason for varying notation is due to the theory of point processes, which has a couple of mathematical interpretations. For example, a simple Poisson point process may be considered as a random set, which suggests the notation <math>\\textstyle x\\in {N}</math>, implying that <math>\\textstyle x</math> is a random point belonging to or being an element of the Poisson point process <math>\\textstyle {N}</math>. Another, more general, interpretation is to consider a Poisson or any other point process as a random counting measure,  so one can write the number of points of a Poisson point process <math>\\textstyle {N}</math> being found or located in some (Borel measurable) region <math>\\textstyle B</math>  as <math>\\textstyle {N}(B)</math>, which is a random variable. These different interpretations results in notation being used from mathematical fields such as measure theory and set theory.<ref name=\"ChiuStoyan2013page110\"/>\n\nFor general point processes, sometimes a subscript on the point symbol, for example <math>\\textstyle x</math>, is included so one writes (with set notation) <math>\\textstyle x_i\\in{N}</math> instead of <math>\\textstyle x\\in{N}</math>, and <math>\\textstyle x</math> can be used for the dummy variable in integral expressions such as Campbell's theorem, instead of denoting random points.<ref name=\"baccelli2009stochastic1\"/> Sometimes an uppercase letter denotes the point process, while a lowercase denotes a point from the process, so, for example, the point <math>\\textstyle x</math> or <math>\\textstyle x_i</math> belongs to or is a point of the point process <math>\\textstyle X</math>, and be written with set notation as <math>\\textstyle x\\in X</math> or <math>\\textstyle x_i\\in X</math>.<ref name=\"MollerWaagepetersen2003page7\">{{cite book|author1=Jesper Moller|author2=Rasmus Plenge Waagepetersen|title=Statistical Inference and Simulation for Spatial Point Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBNOHvElXZ4C|date=25 September 2003|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-49693-0|page=7}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the set theory and integral or measure theory notation can be used interchangeably. For example, for a point process <math>\\textstyle N</math> defined on the Euclidean state space <math>\\textstyle {\\textbf{R}^d} </math> and a (measurable) function <math>\\textstyle f</math> on <math>\\textstyle \\textbf{R}^d</math> , the expression\n\n:<math> \\int_{\\textbf{R}^d} f(x)\\,\\mathrm dN(x)=\\sum\\limits_{x_i\\in N} f(x_i), </math>\n\ndemonstrates two different ways to write a summation over a point process (see also [[Campbell's theorem (probability)]]). More specifically, the integral notation on the left-hand side is interpreting the point process as a random counting measure while the sum on the right-hand side suggests a random set interpretation.<ref name=\"ChiuStoyan2013page110\"/>\n\n==Functionals and moment measures==\n\nIn probability theory, operations are applied to random variables for different purposes. Sometimes these operations are regular expectations that produce the average or variance of a random variable. Others, such as characteristic functions (or Laplace transforms) of a random variable can be used to uniquely identify or characterize random variables and prove results like the central limit theorem.<ref name=\"karr1993probability\">A. Karr. ''Probability''. Springer Texts in Statistics Series.

In some cases these rare events are close to being independent, hence a Poisson point process can be used. When the events are not independent, but tend to occur in clusters or ''clumps'', then if these clumps are suitably defined such that they are approximately independent of each other, then the number of  clumps occurring will be close to a Poisson random variable <ref name=\"arratia1993review\"/> and the locations of the clumps will be close to a Poisson process.<ref name=\"aldous1989poisson\"/>\n\n===Stein's method===\n\n[[Stein's method]] is a mathematical technique originally developed for approximating random variables such as [[Gaussian]] and Poisson variables, which has also been applied to point processes.

For example, if a point process, other than a Poisson, has its points randomly and independently displaced, then the process would not necessarily be a Poisson point process. However, under certain mathematical conditions for both the original point process and the random displacement, it has been shown via limit theorems that if the points of a point process are repeatedly displaced in a random and independent manner, then the finite-distribution of the point process will converge (weakly) to that of a Poisson point process.<ref name=\"DaleyVere-Jones2007page131\">{{cite book|author1=D.J.

For example, on the real line, the Poisson process, both homogeneous  or inhomogeneous, is sometimes interpreted as a counting process, and the notation  <math>\\textstyle \\{N(t), t\\geq 0\\}</math> is used to represent the Poisson process.<ref name=\"Tijms2003page1\"/><ref name=\"Ross1996page59\"/>\n\nAnother reason for varying notation is due to the theory of point processes, which has a couple of mathematical interpretations. For example, a simple Poisson point process may be considered as a random set, which suggests the notation <math>\\textstyle x\\in {N}</math>, implying that <math>\\textstyle x</math> is a random point belonging to or being an element of the Poisson point process <math>\\textstyle {N}</math>. Another, more general, interpretation is to consider a Poisson or any other point process as a random counting measure,  so one can write the number of points of a Poisson point process <math>\\textstyle {N}</math> being found or located in some (Borel measurable) region <math>\\textstyle B</math>  as <math>\\textstyle {N}(B)</math>, which is a random variable. These different interpretations results in notation being used from mathematical fields such as measure theory and set theory.<ref name=\"ChiuStoyan2013page110\"/>\n\nFor general point processes, sometimes a subscript on the point symbol, for example <math>\\textstyle x</math>, is included so one writes (with set notation) <math>\\textstyle x_i\\in{N}</math> instead of <math>\\textstyle x\\in{N}</math>, and <math>\\textstyle x</math> can be used for the dummy variable in integral expressions such as Campbell's theorem, instead of denoting random points.<ref name=\"baccelli2009stochastic1\"/> Sometimes an uppercase letter denotes the point process, while a lowercase denotes a point from the process, so, for example, the point <math>\\textstyle x</math> or <math>\\textstyle x_i</math> belongs to or is a point of the point process <math>\\textstyle X</math>, and be written with set notation as <math>\\textstyle x\\in X</math> or <math>\\textstyle x_i\\in X</math>.<ref name=\"MollerWaagepetersen2003page7\">{{cite book|author1=Jesper Moller|author2=Rasmus Plenge Waagepetersen|title=Statistical Inference and Simulation for Spatial Point Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBNOHvElXZ4C|date=25 September 2003|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-49693-0|page=7}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the set theory and integral or measure theory notation can be used interchangeably. For example, for a point process <math>\\textstyle N</math> defined on the Euclidean state space <math>\\textstyle {\\textbf{R}^d} </math> and a (measurable) function <math>\\textstyle f</math> on <math>\\textstyle \\textbf{R}^d</math> , the expression\n\n:<math> \\int_{\\textbf{R}^d} f(x)\\,\\mathrm dN(x)=\\sum\\limits_{x_i\\in N} f(x_i), </math>\n\ndemonstrates two different ways to write a summation over a point process (see also [[Campbell's theorem (probability)]]). More specifically, the integral notation on the left-hand side is interpreting the point process as a random counting measure while the sum on the right-hand side suggests a random set interpretation.<ref name=\"ChiuStoyan2013page110\"/>\n\n==Functionals and moment measures==\n\nIn probability theory, operations are applied to random variables for different purposes. Sometimes these operations are regular expectations that produce the average or variance of a random variable. Others, such as characteristic functions (or Laplace transforms) of a random variable can be used to uniquely identify or characterize random variables and prove results like the central limit theorem.<ref name=\"karr1993probability\">A. Karr. ''Probability''. Springer Texts in Statistics Series.

Wiley Online Library, 1989.</ref>  The general  heuristic or principle involves using the Poisson point process (or Poisson distribution) to approximate events, which are considered rare or unlikely, of some stochastic process. In some cases these rare events are close to being independent, hence a Poisson point process can be used. When the events are not independent, but tend to occur in clusters or ''clumps'', then if these clumps are suitably defined such that they are approximately independent of each other, then the number of  clumps occurring will be close to a Poisson random variable <ref name=\"arratia1993review\"/> and the locations of the clumps will be close to a Poisson process.<ref name=\"aldous1989poisson\"/>\n\n===Stein's method===\n\n[[Stein's method]] is a mathematical technique originally developed for approximating random variables such as [[Gaussian]] and Poisson variables, which has also been applied to point processes.

For example, if a point process, other than a Poisson, has its points randomly and independently displaced, then the process would not necessarily be a Poisson point process. However, under certain mathematical conditions for both the original point process and the random displacement, it has been shown via limit theorems that if the points of a point process are repeatedly displaced in a random and independent manner, then the finite-distribution of the point process will converge (weakly) to that of a Poisson point process.<ref name=\"DaleyVere-Jones2007page131\">{{cite book|author1=D.J.

He named various waterways in the district. The waiata {{lang|mi|\"Ka tat\u016b e hine ko Manawat\u016b\"}} describes how his heart ({{lang|mi|manawa}}) settled or momentarily stopped ({{lang|mi|tat\u016b}}) when he saw the Manawatu River.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Government ==\nThe region covers all or part of ten [[territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authority]] areas. Parts of five of these are covered by five other [[regions of New Zealand]], the most of any region. In descending order of land area the territorial authority districts are [[Ruapehu District|Ruapehu]], the major parts of [[Tararua District]] and [[Rangitikei District|Rangitikei]], [[Manawatu District|Manawat\u016b]], [[Whanganui District|Whanganui]], [[Horowhenua District|Horowhenua]], and small parts of [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]], [[Waitomo District|Waitomo]], and [[Taupo District|Taupo]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/NZTerritorialAuthorities.png|title=Map |website=upload.wikimedia.org}}</ref> The largest city is [[Palmerston North]], with a population of 85,300 (June 2012 estimate). It is the only territorial authority in the region to be administered by a city council.\n\nThe governing body of the regional council consists of 12 councillors from 6 constituencies across the region, elected by the public; from the north: Ruapehu (1 councillor), Whanganui (2), Manawatu-Rangitikei (2), Palmerston North (4), Horowhenua-Kairanga (2), Tararua District (1). It sits in Palmerston North. It has the responsibility for managing natural and physical resources, providing flood protection and monitoring environmental problems and fresh air, clean water, productive land and natural eco-systems. It is also responsible for public transport.\n\n==Geography==\nThe region is dominated and defined by two significant river catchments, the [[Whanganui River|Whanganui]] and the [[Manawatu River|Manawatu]]. The Whanganui River, in the northwest, is the longest navigable river in New Zealand. The river was extremely important to early [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] as it was the southern link in a chain of waterways that spanned almost two-thirds of the North Island. It was one of the chief areas of M\u0101ori settlement with its easily fortified cliffs and ample food supplies. Legends emphasise the importance of the river and it remains sacred to Whanganui [[iwi]]. M\u0101ori along the coast and lowland plains grew [[Sweet potato|kumara]] and other crops. The Manawatu River runs across the centre of the region, from rolling hill country in the east to the fertile [[Manawatu Plains]] in the west. The main city of [[Palmerston North]] is located on these plains, and is an important service city for the southern North Island as a whole. This river is unusual, in that it passes from hill country to plains through a gorge cut into much higher country, an indication that the hills have risen since the river formed.\n\nTo the southeast, a further, more sparsely populated area of the [[Tararua District]] lies between the sources of the [[Manawatu River]] near [[Norsewood]] and the Pacific coast. This area, often historically connected with both the [[Hawke's Bay region]] to the north and the [[Wairarapa]] to the south, was historically simply known as Bush, a name which still survives in some businesses and organisations, most notably the [[Wairarapa-Bush Rugby Football Union]].\n\nThe two river catchments have very different natures. While the open Manawatu Plains became more densely settled by Europeans, inland [[Ruapehu District|Ruapehu]], [[Rangitikei (district), New Zealand|Rangitikei]] and [[Whanganui District|Whanganui]] remained more M\u0101ori-dominated, remote and independent, and is still heavily forested. As late as the 1950s the Whanganui River remained a river of mystery. Since then exploitation of the river's commercial potential has opened up the area, often causing friction with local M\u0101ori, who have long-standing grievances. Manawat\u016b-Whanganui as a whole is one of the most important pastoral areas in New Zealand, its status recognised when the government opened the [[Massey University|Massey Agricultural College]] in the 1920s.\n\nMuch of Manawatu-Wanganui was fertile and [[forest|bush]]-covered when Europeans arrived and developed the area as a source of [[timber]]. [[Saw mill]]ing and [[flax]] [[Mill (factory)|milling]] dominated the 19th century, followed by an influx of [[sheep]] farmers who exploited the newly cleared ground. [[Deforestation]], burn-offs of timber and scrub and large scale drainage combined with [[overgrazing]], resulted in considerable environmental degradation. In the early 1900s authorities realised that careful management was needed to maintain this important [[agriculture|agricultural]] area.\n\n===Topography===\nManawat\u016b-Whanganui takes up a large proportion of the lower half of the North Island. It is the second-largest local government region in the North Island and the sixth-largest in New Zealand, totalling 22,215&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (8.1% of New Zealand's land area). The region stretches from north of Taumarunui to south of Levin on the west coast, and across to the east coast from [[Cape Turnagain]] to Owhanga. It borders the [[Waikato]], [[Taranaki]], [[Hawke's Bay (region)|Hawke's Bay]] and [[Wellington (region)|Wellington]] regions and includes river catchment areas that run from the [[volcanic plateau]] to the sea. The [[Pacific Ocean]] is the eastern boundary and the [[Ruahine Ranges]] form a natural boundary with Hawke's Bay.\n\nThe area includes a variety of landscape formations. Districts close to the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau|Volcanic Plateau]] are higher and more rugged, often subject to harsh temperatures in winter. The [[Manawatu (district)|Manawatu District]] has a much gentler topography, consisting mainly of the flat, tree-studded [[Manawatu Plains]] that run between the ranges and the sea. The land was under the sea till about 500,000 years ago and still has a very thick layer of marine sediment, which is about five or six million years old. A [[block fault]]ing system underneath the thick sediment has raised a series of domes and gentle depressions. These structures can provide natural storage areas for oil and some of the Manawatu domes have been drilled. The domes have shaped the course of the Manawatu River, giving it a meandering path which, uniquely among New Zealand rivers, begins close to the east coast and exits on the west coast. The Manawatu River begins just inside the Hawke's Bay region, then flows through a deep gorge to the Manawatu Plains before exiting in the [[Tasman Sea]]. The river is also unique in New Zealand (and rare worldwide) in that this gorge (the [[Manawatu Gorge]]) is a [[water gap]] through recently uplifted rock, causing the river to flow from relatively low-lying land along an eroded course through higher terrain. The [[Whanganui District]] is more rugged, with [[canyon]]-like valleys and gorges carved out of the soft rock by rivers and ocean waves.\n\nThe region includes a series of mountain ranges, notably the [[Tararua Range]] and the [[Ruahine Ranges|Ruahine Range]] and the three major active [[volcano]]es of the North Island. [[Mount Ruapehu]] at 2,797 m is the tallest mountain in the North Island, [[Mount Ngauruhoe|Ngauruhoe]] 2,291 m and [[Mount Tongariro|Tongariro]] 1,968 m. During the last 100 years Ruapehu has experienced six significant eruptions, and last erupted in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThree major rivers divide the region: the Whanganui (290&nbsp;km), Manawat\u016b (182&nbsp;km) and [[Rangitikei River|Rangitikei]] (241&nbsp;km). The Whanganui is the second-longest river and has the second-largest catchment in the North Island, draining most of the inland region west of [[Lake Taupo]]. There are few roads in this area, which contains some of the largest surviving areas of native bush in the North Island.\n\n===Soil and climate===\nSoils are productive with the addition of [[fertiliser]]. In the Manawat\u016b and [[Horowhenua]] Districts there are sandy soils and swampy hollows around the coast with [[loess]]-covered terraces and river flats inland. These river flats and swamp areas contain fertile [[alluvial]] and organic soils. On the drier terraces inland yellow-grey earths predominate. The flatter more fertile soils suit intensive sheep farming and cropping while the hill country of Rangitikei favours semi-intensive sheep and [[beef]] farming. Areas close to the volcanic plateau consist largely of [[pumice]] soils which lack some essential trace elements but within the region much of this land is occupied by national parks.\n\nThe region has a comparatively mild climate with greater climatic extremes inland. [[Chateau Tongariro]] experienced the lowest temperature recorded in the North Island, falling to -13.6&nbsp;\u00b0C on 7 July 1937. In summer the region is warm, with a maximum mid-summer daily average of between 20.1 and 22.9&nbsp;\u00b0C. Sunshine hours approximate the national average for much of the region (1,800-2,000 hours per annum) but Palmerston North is defined as cloudy with an average of 1,725 sunshine hours. In the winter the minimum mid-winter daily average for coastal areas is 4.0 to 7.9&nbsp;\u00b0C, while inland areas are considerably colder. [[Waiouru]] has a minimum mid-winter daily average of 0.1&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nRainfall on the plains is slightly below average, with Palmerston North receiving 960&nbsp;mm, while the rest of the region receives the New Zealand average rainfall of 1,000-2,000&nbsp;mm.\n\n===Conservation and parks===\nThe region contains areas of great ecological significance, reflected in the designation of approximately a seventh of its land area as part of the nation's conservation estate. [[Tongariro National Park]] is the largest park in the region (795.98&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and is the oldest national park in the country, established in 1887. The volcanoes Tongariro, Ruapehu and Ngauruhoe are sacred to M\u0101ori and were given to the nation by [[Te Heuheu Tukino IV]], paramount chief of [[Ngati Tuwharetoa]]. They form the nucleus of the park, which is designated a [[world heritage]] area.\n\n[[Whanganui National Park]] is slightly smaller (742.31&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and was established 99 years later when a series of reserves were incorporated into one area and given national park status. There are two state forest parks in the rugged, bush-clad Ruahine Range and Tararua Range. The four parks offer [[skiing]], [[tramping]], [[jetboat]]ing and white-water [[rafting]] and the opportunity to appreciate the environment.\n\nThe regional council, responsible for managing natural and physical resources, provides flood protection and monitors environmental problems such as pest infestation and pollution. Invasive plant pests such as [[African feathergrass]], [[Galega officinalis|goats rue]] and nodding [[thistle]] pose a threat to pastureland in this heavily agricultural-dependent region, and the council has instituted control campaigns. The council has also instituted animal pest control programmes. [[Common brushtail possum|Possums]] are perceived as the major animal pest since they damage native forests and endanger cattle production through the spread of bovine [[tuberculosis]]. Eradication programmes also concentrate on [[rabbit]]s, [[Rook (bird)|rook]]s and feral [[goat]]s, while other exotic species such as [[Parma wallaby]] (''Macropus parma''),{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[wasp]]s, [[ferret]]s, [[stoat]]s and [[weasel]]s are a source of concern.\n\n===Biodiversity===\nThe internationally recognised [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] estuarine wetlands site at [[Foxton Beach]] is of note as having one of the most diverse ranges of wetlands birds to be seen at any one place in New Zealand. A total of 95 species have been identified at the estuary. It is a significant area of salt marsh and mudflat and a valuable feeding ground for many birds including the migratory Eastern bar-tailed Godwit, which flies all the way from Siberia to New Zealand to escape the harsh northern winter. The estuary is also a permanent home to 13 species of birds, six species of fish and four plants species, all of which are threatened. It regularly supports about one percent of the world population of wrybills.<ref name=\"doc.govt.nz\">{{cite web |title=Manawatu Estuary |url=https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/manawatu-whanganui/places/manawatu-estuary |website=doc.govt.nz |publisher=New Zealand Department of Conservation |language=en-nz}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]]  Text was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref>\n\n==People==\n[[File:ManawatuWanganuiRegionPopulationDensity.png|thumb|right|280px| Population density in Manawat\u016b-Whanganui at the 2006 census]]\n\nThe region had a usually resident population of 222,672 people at the 2013 census, the sixth-largest population in New Zealand. Between the 2006 and 2013 censuses the population rose by 249, which is less than one percent.<ref>{{NZ Quickstats2013|14181|Manawatu-Wanganui Region}}</ref>\n\nThere are two major urban areas. [[Palmerston North]], with a resident population of {{NZ population data 2018|Palmerston North|y}} ({{NZ population data 2018|}|y}} estimate), expanded as an educational centre and a supply centre for the surrounding rural hinterland. It became a city in 1930. The other major urban area is [[Whanganui]], with an estimated resident population of {{NZ population data 2018|Whanganui|y|y|y|as of |.}} Other urban centres include [[Levin, New Zealand|Levin]], [[Feilding]], [[Dannevirke]], [[Taumarunui]], [[Foxton, New Zealand|Foxton]], and [[Marton, New Zealand|Marton]]. The region also includes the smaller towns of Bulls, Ohakune, Waiouru, Raetihi, Taihape, Woodville, Pahiatua, Eketahuna, Ashhurst, Foxton Beach, Turakina, Sanson, Shannon and Manakau.\n\nCity life does not dominate, as half the population live outside a large urban area, over a third in small towns or rural areas. While [[manufacturing]] has become an important part of the economy, most businesses are agriculturally based and agriculture remains the linchpin. The dominance of agriculture, combined with the relatively small scale of most urban areas, gives a rural quality to the region, quite distinct from the neighbouring [[Wellington Region]]. The rugged interior has become one of the main training areas for the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], which maintain three bases in the region: [[RNZAF Base Ohakea]], [[Linton Military Camp]], and [[Waiouru Military Camp]].\n\n===Cities and towns===\n{{Largest cities\n| name        = Largest cities in Manawatu-Wanganui\n| class       = nav\n| country     = Manawat\u016b-Whanganui\n| stat_ref    = Statistics New Zealand {{NZ population data 2018|||y}} estimate{{NZ population data 2018||||y}}\n| div_name    = \n| div_link    = \n\n| city_1 = Palmerston North | div_1 =  | pop_1 = {{NZ population data 2018|Palmerston North|y}} | img_1 = Palmerston north city.jpg\n| city_2 = Whanganui | div_2 =  | pop_2 = {{NZ population data 2018|Whanganui|y}} | img_2 = Whanganui River to Dublin Street Bridge.jpg\n| city_3 = Levin, New Zealand{{!}}Levin | div_3 =  | pop_3 = {{NZ population data 2018|Levin|y}} | img_3 = Levin.jpg\n| city_4 = Feilding | div_4 =  | pop_4 = {{NZ population data 2018|Feilding|y}} | img_4 = Feilding, NZ.jpg\n| city_5 = Dannevirke | div_5 =  | pop_5 = {{NZ population data 2018|Dannevirke|y}}\n| city_6 = Marton, New Zealand{{!}}Marton | div_6 =  | pop_6 = {{NZ population data 2018|Marton|y}}\n| city_7 = Taumarunui | div_7 =  | pop_7 = {{NZ population data 2018|Taumarunui|y}}\n| city_8 = Foxton, New Zealand{{!}} Foxton | div_8 =  | pop_8 = {{NZ population data 2018|Foxton|y}}\n| city_9 = Ashhurst | div_9 =  | pop_9 = {{NZ population data 2018|Ashhurst|y}}\n| city_10 = Pahiatua | div_10 = | pop_10 = {{NZ population data 2018|Pahiatua|y}}\n}}\n\n===Culture and identity===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Ethnic groups of Manawat\u016b-Whanganui residents, 2013 census<ref>{{cite web |title= Ethnic group (total responses), for the census usually resident population count, 2001, 2006, and 2013 Censuses (RC, TA, AU) |url= http://nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz/wbos/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLECODE8020 |publisher= Statistics New Zealand}}</ref>\n|-\n!

A higher than average proportion of businesses were engaged in the [[agriculture]], [[forestry]] and [[fishing]] industries, 6.3% compared with 4.4% nationally. Businesses engaged in retail trade were dominant numerically. In 1997 there were 2,300 businesses, employing a total of 10,380 full-time\nequivalents (FTEs). The percentage of businesses engaged in manufacturing was slightly higher than the national average and manufacturing employed the greatest number of people (12,830 FTEs).\n\n===Energy===\nUnlike its neighbour [[Taranaki]], Manawat\u016b-Whanganui has not been a major producer of energy or minerals. Some new power schemes are operating, including the southern hemisphere's largest collection<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windenergy.org.nz|title=NZWEA Home Page|website=www.windenergy.org.nz}}</ref> of [[wind farm]]s, with 194 installed turbines and more planned.\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe region is known for its strong agricultural base, which prompted the establishment of an agricultural college there in the 1920s. The government wanted to promote scientific farming and established colleges in two of the most important farming areas, [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] and the Manawat\u016b. Research by members of the college into animal genetics in the 1930s led to the development of new breeds of sheep, the [[Drysdale (sheep)|Drysdale]] and the [[Perendale]], which became commercially significant after World War II.\n\nAgriculture dominates land use although there are areas of forestry and [[horticulture]]. Soils and climate favour pastoral farming. There were 6,344 farm holdings on 30 June 1996, which was almost a tenth of all farm holdings in New Zealand. Farming occupied 72.5% of land, which was much higher than the national average of 60.1%. Approximately 80% of this land was used for agricultural purposes (grazing, arable, fodder and fallow land). In the Manawat\u016b, Rangitikei and Tararua Districts this percentage rose to over 90% of total land.\n\nThe region is one of the most important areas of pastoral farming in New Zealand. It had 7,216,177 sheep (at 30 June 1996), the largest number of sheep in the North Island and the fourth-highest figure in the country behind Canterbury, [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] and [[Otago]]. [[Barley]], which is used for the manufacture of stock feed and for malting, is grown. The region produces the largest quantities of barley in the North Island, providing 10% of the national refined crop of 302,804 tonnes in 1995. The region also produces a significant proportion of vegetables in New Zealand. By planted land area, the region produces 25% of the country's [[lettuce]], 23% percent of its [[asparagus]], and 19% of its [[broccoli]], [[cabbage]] and [[cauliflower]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freshfacts.co.nz/files/freshfacts-2018.pdf|title=Fresh Facts: New Zealand Horticulture|date=2018|website=Plant & Food Research|issn=1177-2190}}</ref>\n\n===Forestry===\nThe region is one of the most significant forestry areas in the southern North Island. The predominant soil type, yellow-brown earths, when enhanced by the use of fertilisers, is very suitable for forestry. Forestry has a long history in the Manawat\u016b since Palmerston North developed as a saw-milling town, and the region's initial prosperity depended on heavy exploitation of native timbers. But land use practices inhibited the long term viability of this indigenous forestry industry. Severe burn-offs destroyed large areas of native forest and subsequent overgrazing affected the soils. Forestry largely disappeared until the early twentieth century. In an attempt to combat erosion problems in sandy soils the government planted forests in the Foxton/Levin area in the early twentieth century. Inland forests were planted later. Some private native forest has been set aside for sustainable logging but most forestry depends on exotic plantings.\n\n===Tourism===\nFor the eight quarters between September 1996 and June 1998 the region averaged 4.1% of total guest nights in New Zealand. This was close behind Wellington at 6.7% and greater than Hawke's Bay, which averaged 3.1%. Occupancy rates, at 20.1%, were the fourth-lowest in the country for the June 1998 quarter. Rates for the city of Palmerston North were significantly higher than the national average (39.5% compared with 25.8%) whereas districts such as Ruapehu are far more seasonal with fairly low occupancy rates except in the peak ski season.\n\n===Transport===\n[[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]], the main highway, and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] railway, which both link [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]], run through the region. The [[Palmerston North\u2013Gisborne Line]] and [[New Zealand State Highway 3|State Highway 3]] follow the [[Manawatu Gorge]], linking the region with Hawke's Bay. The [[Marton\u2013New Plymouth Line]] provides a railway link with Taranaki, and from this line the short [[Wanganui Branch]] runs to Whanganui. Road and rail transport give the region's exporters easy access to ports.\n\nThe region has approximately 16% of the North Island's road length. There are 8,732&nbsp;km of road, of which two-thirds are sealed. Approximately 12% of roads are classified as urban and three-quarters as rural, with almost half of the rural roads being unsealed. With 945.9&nbsp;km the region has the second-highest length of state highways in the North Island, after Waikato.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/publications/analytical%20reports/new%20zealand%20a%20regional%20profile%201998/regional-profile-manawatu-wanganui.aspx A regional profile: Manawatu/Wanganui], [[Statistics New Zealand]].\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Manawatu-Whanganui Region}}\n* [http://www.horizons.govt.nz/ Horizons Regional Council]\n* [http://www.manawatunz.co.nz/ Destination Manawatu]\n\n{{coord|-39.6|175.6|region:NZ-MWT_type:adm1st|display=title}}\n\n{{Regions of New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:Manawat\u016b-Whanganui| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use New Zealand English|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2019}}\n{{short description|Region of New Zealand}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name = Manawat\u016b-Whanganui\n|settlement_type = [[Regions of New Zealand|Region of New Zealand]]\n|total_type = Region\n|image_map = Position of ManawatuWanganui.png\n|subdivision_type = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name = {{NZL}}\n|subdivision_type1 = Island\n|subdivision_name1 = [[North Island]]\n|seat = [[Palmerston North]]\n|parts_type = [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|Territorial authorities]]\n|parts_style = list\n|p1 = [[Palmerston North City]]\n|p2 = [[Manawatu District]]\n|p3 = [[Horowhenua District]]\n|p4 = [[Tararua District]]\n|p5 = [[Rangitikei District]]\n|p6 = [[Whanganui District]]\n|p7 = [[Ruapehu District]]\n|p8 = [[Stratford District, New Zealand|Stratford District]] (part)\n|p9 = [[Waitomo District]] (part)\n|p10 = [[Taupo District]] (part)\n|leader_title = Chairperson\n|leader_name = Rachel Keedwell \n|leader_title1 = Deputy Chairperson\n|leader_name1 = [[Jono Naylor]]\n|established_title = Established\n|established_date = 1989\n|area_total_km2 = 22215\n|elevation_max_m = 2797\n|elevation_min_m = 0\n|population_as_of = {{NZ population data 2018|||y}}\n|population_footnotes = <ref name=\"NZ_population_data_2018\"/>\n|population_total = {{NZ population data 2018|Manawatu-Wanganui region|y}}\n|population_density_km2 = auto\n| blank_name_sec1                 = [[Human Development Index|HDI]] (2017)\n| blank_info_sec1                 = 0.894<ref name=\"GlobalDataLab\">{{Cite web|url=https://hdi.globaldatalab.org/areadata/shdi/|title=Sub-national HDI - Area Database - Global Data Lab|website=hdi.globaldatalab.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref><br/>{{color|#090|very high}} \u00b7 [[List of regions of New Zealand by Human Development Index|13th]]\n|timezone = [[NZST]]\n|utc_offset = +12\n|timezone_DST = NZDT\n|utc_offset_DST = +13\n|website = [http://www.horizons.govt.nz/ www.Horizons.govt.nz]\n}}\n\n'''Manawat\u016b-Whanganui'''<ref>{{cite news |title=Seal of approval for spelling of Manawat\u016b-Whanganui region |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/399415/seal-of-approval-for-spelling-of-manawatu-whanganui-region |work=[[Radio New Zealand|RNZ]] |date=23 September 2019 |language=en-nz}}</ref> ({{IPA-mi|manawa\u02c8t\u0289\u02d0 \u02c8\u0294wa\u014ban\u0289i|}}; spelled '''Manawatu-Wanganui''' prior to 2019) is a [[regions of New Zealand|region]] in the lower half of the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]], whose main population centres are the cities of [[Palmerston North]] and [[Whanganui]].

He named various waterways in the district. The waiata {{lang|mi|\"Ka tat\u016b e hine ko Manawat\u016b\"}} describes how his heart ({{lang|mi|manawa}}) settled or momentarily stopped ({{lang|mi|tat\u016b}}) when he saw the Manawatu River.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Government ==\nThe region covers all or part of ten [[territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authority]] areas. Parts of five of these are covered by five other [[regions of New Zealand]], the most of any region. In descending order of land area the territorial authority districts are [[Ruapehu District|Ruapehu]], the major parts of [[Tararua District]] and [[Rangitikei District|Rangitikei]], [[Manawatu District|Manawat\u016b]], [[Whanganui District|Whanganui]], [[Horowhenua District|Horowhenua]], and small parts of [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]], [[Waitomo District|Waitomo]], and [[Taupo District|Taupo]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/NZTerritorialAuthorities.png|title=Map |website=upload.wikimedia.org}}</ref> The largest city is [[Palmerston North]], with a population of 85,300 (June 2012 estimate). It is the only territorial authority in the region to be administered by a city council.\n\nThe governing body of the regional council consists of 12 councillors from 6 constituencies across the region, elected by the public; from the north: Ruapehu (1 councillor), Whanganui (2), Manawatu-Rangitikei (2), Palmerston North (4), Horowhenua-Kairanga (2), Tararua District (1). It sits in Palmerston North. It has the responsibility for managing natural and physical resources, providing flood protection and monitoring environmental problems and fresh air, clean water, productive land and natural eco-systems. It is also responsible for public transport.\n\n==Geography==\nThe region is dominated and defined by two significant river catchments, the [[Whanganui River|Whanganui]] and the [[Manawatu River|Manawatu]]. The Whanganui River, in the northwest, is the longest navigable river in New Zealand. The river was extremely important to early [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] as it was the southern link in a chain of waterways that spanned almost two-thirds of the North Island. It was one of the chief areas of M\u0101ori settlement with its easily fortified cliffs and ample food supplies. Legends emphasise the importance of the river and it remains sacred to Whanganui [[iwi]]. M\u0101ori along the coast and lowland plains grew [[Sweet potato|kumara]] and other crops. The Manawatu River runs across the centre of the region, from rolling hill country in the east to the fertile [[Manawatu Plains]] in the west. The main city of [[Palmerston North]] is located on these plains, and is an important service city for the southern North Island as a whole. This river is unusual, in that it passes from hill country to plains through a gorge cut into much higher country, an indication that the hills have risen since the river formed.\n\nTo the southeast, a further, more sparsely populated area of the [[Tararua District]] lies between the sources of the [[Manawatu River]] near [[Norsewood]] and the Pacific coast. This area, often historically connected with both the [[Hawke's Bay region]] to the north and the [[Wairarapa]] to the south, was historically simply known as Bush, a name which still survives in some businesses and organisations, most notably the [[Wairarapa-Bush Rugby Football Union]].\n\nThe two river catchments have very different natures. While the open Manawatu Plains became more densely settled by Europeans, inland [[Ruapehu District|Ruapehu]], [[Rangitikei (district), New Zealand|Rangitikei]] and [[Whanganui District|Whanganui]] remained more M\u0101ori-dominated, remote and independent, and is still heavily forested. As late as the 1950s the Whanganui River remained a river of mystery. Since then exploitation of the river's commercial potential has opened up the area, often causing friction with local M\u0101ori, who have long-standing grievances. Manawat\u016b-Whanganui as a whole is one of the most important pastoral areas in New Zealand, its status recognised when the government opened the [[Massey University|Massey Agricultural College]] in the 1920s.\n\nMuch of Manawatu-Wanganui was fertile and [[forest|bush]]-covered when Europeans arrived and developed the area as a source of [[timber]]. [[Saw mill]]ing and [[flax]] [[Mill (factory)|milling]] dominated the 19th century, followed by an influx of [[sheep]] farmers who exploited the newly cleared ground. [[Deforestation]], burn-offs of timber and scrub and large scale drainage combined with [[overgrazing]], resulted in considerable environmental degradation. In the early 1900s authorities realised that careful management was needed to maintain this important [[agriculture|agricultural]] area.\n\n===Topography===\nManawat\u016b-Whanganui takes up a large proportion of the lower half of the North Island. It is the second-largest local government region in the North Island and the sixth-largest in New Zealand, totalling 22,215&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (8.1% of New Zealand's land area). The region stretches from north of Taumarunui to south of Levin on the west coast, and across to the east coast from [[Cape Turnagain]] to Owhanga. It borders the [[Waikato]], [[Taranaki]], [[Hawke's Bay (region)|Hawke's Bay]] and [[Wellington (region)|Wellington]] regions and includes river catchment areas that run from the [[volcanic plateau]] to the sea. The [[Pacific Ocean]] is the eastern boundary and the [[Ruahine Ranges]] form a natural boundary with Hawke's Bay.\n\nThe area includes a variety of landscape formations. Districts close to the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau|Volcanic Plateau]] are higher and more rugged, often subject to harsh temperatures in winter. The [[Manawatu (district)|Manawatu District]] has a much gentler topography, consisting mainly of the flat, tree-studded [[Manawatu Plains]] that run between the ranges and the sea. The land was under the sea till about 500,000 years ago and still has a very thick layer of marine sediment, which is about five or six million years old. A [[block fault]]ing system underneath the thick sediment has raised a series of domes and gentle depressions. These structures can provide natural storage areas for oil and some of the Manawatu domes have been drilled. The domes have shaped the course of the Manawatu River, giving it a meandering path which, uniquely among New Zealand rivers, begins close to the east coast and exits on the west coast. The Manawatu River begins just inside the Hawke's Bay region, then flows through a deep gorge to the Manawatu Plains before exiting in the [[Tasman Sea]]. The river is also unique in New Zealand (and rare worldwide) in that this gorge (the [[Manawatu Gorge]]) is a [[water gap]] through recently uplifted rock, causing the river to flow from relatively low-lying land along an eroded course through higher terrain. The [[Whanganui District]] is more rugged, with [[canyon]]-like valleys and gorges carved out of the soft rock by rivers and ocean waves.\n\nThe region includes a series of mountain ranges, notably the [[Tararua Range]] and the [[Ruahine Ranges|Ruahine Range]] and the three major active [[volcano]]es of the North Island. [[Mount Ruapehu]] at 2,797 m is the tallest mountain in the North Island, [[Mount Ngauruhoe|Ngauruhoe]] 2,291 m and [[Mount Tongariro|Tongariro]] 1,968 m. During the last 100 years Ruapehu has experienced six significant eruptions, and last erupted in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThree major rivers divide the region: the Whanganui (290&nbsp;km), Manawat\u016b (182&nbsp;km) and [[Rangitikei River|Rangitikei]] (241&nbsp;km). The Whanganui is the second-longest river and has the second-largest catchment in the North Island, draining most of the inland region west of [[Lake Taupo]]. There are few roads in this area, which contains some of the largest surviving areas of native bush in the North Island.\n\n===Soil and climate===\nSoils are productive with the addition of [[fertiliser]]. In the Manawat\u016b and [[Horowhenua]] Districts there are sandy soils and swampy hollows around the coast with [[loess]]-covered terraces and river flats inland. These river flats and swamp areas contain fertile [[alluvial]] and organic soils. On the drier terraces inland yellow-grey earths predominate. The flatter more fertile soils suit intensive sheep farming and cropping while the hill country of Rangitikei favours semi-intensive sheep and [[beef]] farming. Areas close to the volcanic plateau consist largely of [[pumice]] soils which lack some essential trace elements but within the region much of this land is occupied by national parks.\n\nThe region has a comparatively mild climate with greater climatic extremes inland. [[Chateau Tongariro]] experienced the lowest temperature recorded in the North Island, falling to -13.6&nbsp;\u00b0C on 7 July 1937. In summer the region is warm, with a maximum mid-summer daily average of between 20.1 and 22.9&nbsp;\u00b0C. Sunshine hours approximate the national average for much of the region (1,800-2,000 hours per annum) but Palmerston North is defined as cloudy with an average of 1,725 sunshine hours. In the winter the minimum mid-winter daily average for coastal areas is 4.0 to 7.9&nbsp;\u00b0C, while inland areas are considerably colder. [[Waiouru]] has a minimum mid-winter daily average of 0.1&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nRainfall on the plains is slightly below average, with Palmerston North receiving 960&nbsp;mm, while the rest of the region receives the New Zealand average rainfall of 1,000-2,000&nbsp;mm.\n\n===Conservation and parks===\nThe region contains areas of great ecological significance, reflected in the designation of approximately a seventh of its land area as part of the nation's conservation estate. [[Tongariro National Park]] is the largest park in the region (795.98&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and is the oldest national park in the country, established in 1887. The volcanoes Tongariro, Ruapehu and Ngauruhoe are sacred to M\u0101ori and were given to the nation by [[Te Heuheu Tukino IV]], paramount chief of [[Ngati Tuwharetoa]]. They form the nucleus of the park, which is designated a [[world heritage]] area.\n\n[[Whanganui National Park]] is slightly smaller (742.31&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and was established 99 years later when a series of reserves were incorporated into one area and given national park status. There are two state forest parks in the rugged, bush-clad Ruahine Range and Tararua Range. The four parks offer [[skiing]], [[tramping]], [[jetboat]]ing and white-water [[rafting]] and the opportunity to appreciate the environment.\n\nThe regional council, responsible for managing natural and physical resources, provides flood protection and monitors environmental problems such as pest infestation and pollution. Invasive plant pests such as [[African feathergrass]], [[Galega officinalis|goats rue]] and nodding [[thistle]] pose a threat to pastureland in this heavily agricultural-dependent region, and the council has instituted control campaigns. The council has also instituted animal pest control programmes. [[Common brushtail possum|Possums]] are perceived as the major animal pest since they damage native forests and endanger cattle production through the spread of bovine [[tuberculosis]]. Eradication programmes also concentrate on [[rabbit]]s, [[Rook (bird)|rook]]s and feral [[goat]]s, while other exotic species such as [[Parma wallaby]] (''Macropus parma''),{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[wasp]]s, [[ferret]]s, [[stoat]]s and [[weasel]]s are a source of concern.\n\n==People==\n[[File:ManawatuWanganuiRegionPopulationDensity.png|thumb|right|280px| Population density in Manawat\u016b-Whanganui at the 2006 census]]\n\nThe region had a usually resident population of 222,672 people at the 2013 census, the sixth-largest population in New Zealand. Between the 2006 and 2013 censuses the population rose by 249, which is less than one percent.<ref>{{NZ Quickstats2013|14181|Manawatu-Wanganui Region}}</ref>\n\nThere are two major urban areas. [[Palmerston North]], with a resident population of {{NZ population data 2018|Palmerston North|y}} ({{NZ population data 2018|}|y}} estimate), expanded as an educational centre and a supply centre for the surrounding rural hinterland. It became a city in 1930. The other major urban area is [[Whanganui]], with an estimated resident population of {{NZ population data 2018|Whanganui|y|y|y|as of |.}} Other urban centres include [[Levin, New Zealand|Levin]], [[Feilding]], [[Dannevirke]], [[Taumarunui]], [[Foxton, New Zealand|Foxton]], and [[Marton, New Zealand|Marton]]. The region also includes the smaller towns of Bulls, Ohakune, Waiouru, Raetihi, Taihape, Woodville, Pahiatua, Eketahuna, Ashhurst, Foxton Beach, Turakina, Sanson, Shannon and Manakau.\n\nCity life does not dominate, as half the population live outside a large urban area, over a third in small towns or rural areas. While [[manufacturing]] has become an important part of the economy, most businesses are agriculturally based and agriculture remains the linchpin. The dominance of agriculture, combined with the relatively small scale of most urban areas, gives a rural quality to the region, quite distinct from the neighbouring [[Wellington Region]]. The rugged interior has become one of the main training areas for the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], which maintain three bases in the region: [[RNZAF Base Ohakea]], [[Linton Military Camp]], and [[Waiouru Military Camp]].\n\n===Cities and towns===\n{{Largest cities\n| name        = Largest cities in Manawatu-Wanganui\n| class       = nav\n| country     = Manawat\u016b-Whanganui\n| stat_ref    = Statistics New Zealand {{NZ population data 2018|||y}} estimate{{NZ population data 2018||||y}}\n| div_name    = \n| div_link    = \n\n| city_1 = Palmerston North | div_1 =  | pop_1 = {{NZ population data 2018|Palmerston North|y}} | img_1 = Palmerston north city.jpg\n| city_2 = Whanganui | div_2 =  | pop_2 = {{NZ population data 2018|Whanganui|y}} | img_2 = Whanganui River to Dublin Street Bridge.jpg\n| city_3 = Levin, New Zealand{{!}}Levin | div_3 =  | pop_3 = {{NZ population data 2018|Levin|y}} | img_3 = Levin.jpg\n| city_4 = Feilding | div_4 =  | pop_4 = {{NZ population data 2018|Feilding|y}} | img_4 = Feilding, NZ.jpg\n| city_5 = Dannevirke | div_5 =  | pop_5 = {{NZ population data 2018|Dannevirke|y}}\n| city_6 = Marton, New Zealand{{!}}Marton | div_6 =  | pop_6 = {{NZ population data 2018|Marton|y}}\n| city_7 = Taumarunui | div_7 =  | pop_7 = {{NZ population data 2018|Taumarunui|y}}\n| city_8 = Foxton, New Zealand{{!}} Foxton | div_8 =  | pop_8 = {{NZ population data 2018|Foxton|y}}\n| city_9 = Ashhurst | div_9 =  | pop_9 = {{NZ population data 2018|Ashhurst|y}}\n| city_10 = Pahiatua | div_10 = | pop_10 = {{NZ population data 2018|Pahiatua|y}}\n}}\n\n===Culture and identity===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Ethnic groups of Manawat\u016b-Whanganui residents, 2013 census<ref>{{cite web |title= Ethnic group (total responses), for the census usually resident population count, 2001, 2006, and 2013 Censuses (RC, TA, AU) |url= http://nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz/wbos/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLECODE8020 |publisher= Statistics New Zealand}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Coastal M\u0101ori garden and gather food but life for M\u0101ori further inland is more difficult, relying on hunting and gathering.\n* 1820\u201340 [[Ngati Toa|Ng\u0101ti Toa]] and [[Te Atiawa]] [[iwi]] displace local iwi from their lands.\n* 1830 [[Te Rauparaha]] (Ngati Toa) lay siege to P\u016btiki [[P\u0101 (M\u0101ori)|P\u0101]] in retaliation for an attack on [[Kapiti Island]], sacking the p\u0101 and killing its inhabitants.\n* 1831 European traders arrive in the Whanganui area, led by Joe Rowe, supposedly a dealer in preserved heads ([[moko mokai]]). A dispute with local M\u0101ori leads to the death of three of his party and his own head is cut off and preserved.\n* 1840 [[Jerningham Wakefield]] ([[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s son) purchases {{convert|40000|acre|km2}} of land, under dubious circumstances, for the [[New Zealand Company]], including the town site for Petre (later to be Wanganui). The first European settlers start arriving in Petre.\n* 1842 The first organised European settlers in [[Horowhenua]] arrive at [[Paiaka]].\n* 1847 In July the \"Battle of St John's Wood\" occurs when 400 M\u0101ori clash with an equal force of British Regulars.\n* 1848 The Crown purchases Wanganui, {{convert|80000|acre|km2}}, {{convert|8000|acre|km2}} of which are supposed to be set aside as a reserve.\n* 1855 Paiaka settlers move closer to the coast at \"[[Foxton, New Zealand|Foxton]]\", which becomes a port handling flax, timber and agricultural produce.\n* 1856 The ''[[Wanganui Chronicle]]'' is first published.\n* 1860s Scandinavians settle in the [[Tararua (district), New Zealand|Tararua]] District, later founding [[Eketahuna]], [[Dannevirke]], and [[Norsewood]].\n* 1865 A battle ensues between the [[Pai Marire|Hau Hau]] adherents (who were largely upper Whanganui M\u0101ori), who want to expel the [[P\u0101keh\u0101]] at Wanganui, and the M\u0101ori of the lower river.\n* 1866 [[Palmerston North]] (Te Papai-oea) is founded. It is surrounded by forests, with the Manawatu River serving as its only link with the port of Foxton and the outside world.\n* 1870s The bush is gradually felled and the Manawatu opened up for European farms and settlement. Former [[Denmark|Danish]] Prime Minister, Bishop [[Ditlev Gothard Monrad]], organises a settlement of Danes near [[Awapuni, Manawatu-Wanganui|Awapuni]].\n* 1871 The first sawmill is established at Palmerston North.\n* 1872 Wanganui becomes a borough.\n* 1875 The ''[[Manawatu Times]]'' is published for the first time at Palmerston North.\n* 1876 A railway opens between Foxton and Palmerston North via Longburn, later named the [[Foxton Branch]]. [[Wellington Province]] abolished.\n* 1877 Palmerston North becomes a borough.\n* 1878 A railway line opens between Palmerston North and Wanganui. The first portion later became part of the [[North Island Main Trunk Railway]], between [[Aramoho]] and Wanganui the [[Wanganui and Castlecliff Branches|Wanganui Branch]], and the rest part of the [[Marton\u2013New Plymouth Line]].\n* 1884 The [[Sanson Tramway]], built and operated by the Manawatu County Council, opens to [[Sanson, New Zealand]] from the Foxton Branch at [[Himatangi]].\n* 1885 Mother [[Mary Joseph Aubert]] starts her community of the Daughters of Our Lady of Compassion at [[Jerusalem, New Zealand|Jerusalem]], founding a home for M\u0101ori orphans, the elderly and infirm. The private [[Wanganui and Castlecliff Branches|Castleciff Railway]] opens between Wanganui and Castlecliff.\n* 1886 The [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway]] opens between [[Wellington]] and Longburn railway (later the [[North Island Main Trunk]]), superseding the Foxton link and ensuring Palmerston North's growth.\n* 1889 [[Levin, New Zealand|Levin]] is founded because of the construction of Wellington & Manawatu Railway\n* 1908 The North Island Main Trunk reaches [[Taumarunui]] and thence [[Auckland]], opening up the inland districts for development.\n* 1906 Levin becomes a borough.\n* 1924 Wanganui becomes a city.\n* 1930 Palmerston North becomes a city.\n* 1934 A major earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale strikes near Pahiatua and causes widespread damage from Porangahau to Castlepoint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.geonet.org.nz/display/quake/M+7.6,+Horoeka,+5+March+1934|title=GeoNet News|website=info.geonet.org.nz}}</ref>\n* 1939 [[Ohakea]] [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|Air Force]] Station commences operations.\n* 1945 The Sanson Tramway closes.\n* 1953 New Zealand's worst rail disaster occurs at [[Tangiwai disaster|Tangiwai]] on the North Island Main Trunk, as the railway bridge collapses because of a [[lahar]] flow from the crater lake on [[Mount Ruapehu]]. A train with Christmas holiday-makers plunges into the flood, killing 151 people.\n* 1956 The private railway between Wanganui and Castlecliff is purchased by the government and incorporated into the [[Rail transport in New Zealand|national railway network]] as the Castlecliff Branch.\n* 1959 The Foxton Branch railway closes.\n* 1963 [[Massey University]] is formed by a merger of a branch of [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]] (at Palmerston North) with Massey Agricultural College.\n* 1970 Famous New Zealand poet [[James K.

A higher than average proportion of businesses were engaged in the [[agriculture]], [[forestry]] and [[fishing]] industries, 6.3% compared with 4.4% nationally. Businesses engaged in retail trade were dominant numerically. In 1997 there were 2,300 businesses, employing a total of 10,380 full-time\nequivalents (FTEs). The percentage of businesses engaged in manufacturing was slightly higher than the national average and manufacturing employed the greatest number of people (12,830 FTEs).\n\n===Energy===\nUnlike its neighbour [[Taranaki]], Manawat\u016b-Whanganui has not been a major producer of energy or minerals. Some new power schemes are operating, including the southern hemisphere's largest collection<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windenergy.org.nz|title=NZWEA Home Page|website=www.windenergy.org.nz}}</ref> of [[wind farm]]s, with 194 installed turbines and more planned.\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe region is known for its strong agricultural base, which prompted the establishment of an agricultural college there in the 1920s. The government wanted to promote scientific farming and established colleges in two of the most important farming areas, [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] and the Manawat\u016b. Research by members of the college into animal genetics in the 1930s led to the development of new breeds of sheep, the [[Drysdale (sheep)|Drysdale]] and the [[Perendale]], which became commercially significant after World War II.\n\nAgriculture dominates land use although there are areas of forestry and [[horticulture]]. Soils and climate favour pastoral farming. There were 6,344 farm holdings on 30 June 1996, which was almost a tenth of all farm holdings in New Zealand. Farming occupied 72.5% of land, which was much higher than the national average of 60.1%. Approximately 80% of this land was used for agricultural purposes (grazing, arable, fodder and fallow land). In the Manawat\u016b, Rangitikei and Tararua Districts this percentage rose to over 90% of total land.\n\nThe region is one of the most important areas of pastoral farming in New Zealand. It had 7,216,177 sheep (at 30 June 1996), the largest number of sheep in the North Island and the fourth-highest figure in the country behind Canterbury, [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] and [[Otago]]. [[Barley]], which is used for the manufacture of stock feed and for malting, is grown. The region produces the largest quantities of barley in the North Island, providing 10% of the national refined crop of 302,804 tonnes in 1995. The region also produces a significant proportion of vegetables in New Zealand. By planted land area, the region produces 25% of the country's [[lettuce]], 23% percent of its [[asparagus]], and 19% of its [[broccoli]], [[cabbage]] and [[cauliflower]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freshfacts.co.nz/files/freshfacts-2018.pdf|title=Fresh Facts: New Zealand Horticulture|date=2018|website=Plant & Food Research|issn=1177-2190}}</ref>\n\n===Forestry===\nThe region is one of the most significant forestry areas in the southern North Island. The predominant soil type, yellow-brown earths, when enhanced by the use of fertilisers, is very suitable for forestry. Forestry has a long history in the Manawat\u016b since Palmerston North developed as a saw-milling town, and the region's initial prosperity depended on heavy exploitation of native timbers. But land use practices inhibited the long term viability of this indigenous forestry industry. Severe burn-offs destroyed large areas of native forest and subsequent overgrazing affected the soils. Forestry largely disappeared until the early twentieth century. In an attempt to combat erosion problems in sandy soils the government planted forests in the Foxton/Levin area in the early twentieth century. Inland forests were planted later. Some private native forest has been set aside for sustainable logging but most forestry depends on exotic plantings.\n\n===Tourism===\nFor the eight quarters between September 1996 and June 1998 the region averaged 4.1% of total guest nights in New Zealand. This was close behind Wellington at 6.7% and greater than Hawke's Bay, which averaged 3.1%. Occupancy rates, at 20.1%, were the fourth-lowest in the country for the June 1998 quarter. Rates for the city of Palmerston North were significantly higher than the national average (39.5% compared with 25.8%) whereas districts such as Ruapehu are far more seasonal with fairly low occupancy rates except in the peak ski season.\n\n===Transport===\n[[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]], the main highway, and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] railway, which both link [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]], run through the region. The [[Palmerston North\u2013Gisborne Line]] and [[New Zealand State Highway 3|State Highway 3]] follow the [[Manawatu Gorge]], linking the region with Hawke's Bay. The [[Marton\u2013New Plymouth Line]] provides a railway link with Taranaki, and from this line the short [[Wanganui Branch]] runs to Whanganui. Road and rail transport give the region's exporters easy access to ports.\n\nThe region has approximately 16% of the North Island's road length. There are 8,732&nbsp;km of road, of which two-thirds are sealed. Approximately 12% of roads are classified as urban and three-quarters as rural, with almost half of the rural roads being unsealed. With 945.9&nbsp;km the region has the second-highest length of state highways in the North Island, after Waikato.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/publications/analytical%20reports/new%20zealand%20a%20regional%20profile%201998/regional-profile-manawatu-wanganui.aspx A regional profile: Manawatu/Wanganui], [[Statistics New Zealand]].\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Manawatu-Whanganui Region}}\n* [http://www.horizons.govt.nz/ Horizons Regional Council]\n* [http://www.manawatunz.co.nz/ Destination Manawatu]\n\n{{coord|-39.6|175.6|region:NZ-MWT_type:adm1st|display=title}}\n\n{{Regions of New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:Manawat\u016b-Whanganui| ]]\n", "name_user": "Arjanvanderboon", "label": "safe", "comment": "added paragraph on biodiversity", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manawat%C5%AB-Whanganui"}

Some photo manipulations are considered skillful artwork while others are frowned upon as unethical practices, especially when used to deceive the public.  Other examples include being used for political [[propaganda]], or to make a product or person look better, or simply for entertainment purposes or harmless pranks.\n\nDepending on the application and intent, some photo manipulations are considered an [[art form]] because it involves the creation of unique images and in some instances, signature expressions of art by photographic artists.  For example, [[Ansel Adams]] employed some of the more common manipulations using [[Burning and dodging|darkroom exposure techniques]], burning (darkening) and dodging (lightening) a photograph.<ref name=Dziamba>{{cite web | url = https://whitherthebook.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/ansel-adams-and-photography-before-photoshop/ | title = Ansel Adams, and Photography Before Photoshop | author = Jack Dziamba | date = February 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"PBS\">{{cite interview | title=Artbeat | date=November 29, 2012 | accessdate=January 30, 2016 | author=Mia Fineman | interviewer=Tom Legro | work=PBS Newshour | publisher=WPBT2 | location=South Florida | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/slide-show-what-did-we-do-before-photoshop/}}</ref>  Other examples of photo manipulation include retouching photographs using ink or paint, [[airbrushing]], [[double exposure (photography)|double exposure]], piecing photos or negatives together in the darkroom, scratching [[instant film]]s, or through the use of software-based manipulation tools applied to digital images.  There are a number of software applications available for digital image manipulation, ranging from professional applications to very basic imaging software for casual users.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ulysses_S._Grant_at_City_Point.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Ulysses S.

The practice began not long after the creation of the first photograph (1825) by [[Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]] who developed [[heliography]] and made the first photographic print from a photoengraved printing plate.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1885093.stm | publisher = BBC News | date = 21 March 2002 | title = World's oldest photo sold to library | quote = The image of an engraving depicting a man leading a horse was made in 1825 by Nicephore Niepce, who invented a technique known as heliogravure. | accessdate = 2011-11-17}}</ref><ref name=Farid>{{cite web | url = http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/cs4001/history.pdf/ | title = Photo Tampering Throughout History | first = Hany | last = Farid | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150908155915/http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~beki/cs4001/history.pdf | archivedate = September 8, 2015 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Traditional photographic prints can be altered using various methods and techniques that involve manipulation directly to the print, such as retouching with ink, paint, [[airbrush]]ing, or scratching [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroids]] during developing.<ref name=Scratch>{{cite web | url=http://www.pola-art.de/technique/ | title=How to manipulate SX-70? | work = Polaroid SX-70 Art | publisher = Skylab Portfolio | editor = Klaus Wolfer | accessdate = February 2, 2016}}</ref>  Negatives can be manipulated while still in the camera using double-exposure techniques, or in the [[darkroom]] by piecing photos or negatives together.

While the equipment and technology progressed over time, it was not until the late 20th century that photography evolved into the digital realm. At the onset, digital photography was considered by some to be a radical new approach and was initially rejected by photographers because of its substandard quality.<ref name=\"Peres\">{{cite book|last=Peres|first=Michael|title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography, Fourth Edition|year=2007|publisher=Focal Press; 4 edition|isbn=978-0-240-80740-9|page= Preface, 24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYyldcYfq3MC&pg=PR23#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 30, 2016}}</ref> The transition from film to digital has been an ongoing process although great strides were made in the early 21st century as a result of [[innovation]] that has greatly improved digital image quality while reducing the bulk and weight of cameras and equipment.<ref name=Adobe>{{cite web | url = https://www.adobe.com/digitalimag/pdfs/phscs2ip_filmtodig.pdf | publisher = Adobe Systems Incorporated | title = Making The Transition From Film To Digital |author-first=Michael |author-last=Reichmann |author-link=Michael Reichmann | date = 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Early===\nAn early example of tampering was in the early 1860s, when a photo was altered using the body from a portrait of [[John C.

For example, Grant's head is set at a strange angle to his body, his uniform is of a different time period, and his favorite horse [[Cincinnati (horse)|Cincinnati]] did not have a left hind sock like the horse in the photograph, although his other horse Egypt did have a sock but on a different foot. With further research, three different photographs were discovered that explained the composite using Grant's head from one photograph, the body of [[Alexander McDowell McCook|Major General Alexander McDowell McCook]] atop his horse from another photograph, and for the background, and 1864 photograph of [[Confederate Army of the Shenandoah|Confederate prisoners]] captured at the [[Battle of Fisher's Hill]].<ref name=LOC/> Queen Victoria herself once scratched out her own face on the negative of a family picture made in 1852, as she found herself 'horrid' looking.

The altered image made two [[Egyptian pyramids]] appear closer together than they actually were in the original photograph.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/04/magazine/photography-s-new-bag-of-tricks.html?pagewanted=4|publisher=The New York Times Company | date=November 4, 1984 | author=Fred Ritchin | title=Photography's New Bag Of Tricks | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}</ref> The incident triggered a debate about the appropriateness of falsifying an image,<ref name=BRONXDOC>{{cite web|url=http://www.alteredimagesbdc.org/national-geographic/ | title=National Geographic \u2014 Altered Images | publisher=Bronx Documentary Center | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}</ref> and raised questions regarding the magazine's credibility.  Shortly after the incident, Tom Kennedy, director of photography for ''National Geographic'' stated,  \"We no longer use that technology to manipulate elements in a photo simply to achieve a more compelling graphic effect. We regarded that afterwards as a mistake, and we wouldn\u2019t repeat that mistake today.\"<ref name=BRONXDOC/>\n\nThere are other incidents of questionable photo manipulation in journalism.  One such incident arose in early 2005 after [[Martha Stewart]] was released from prison. ''[[Newsweek]]'' used a photograph of Stewart's face on the body of a much slimmer woman for their cover, suggesting that Stewart had lost weight while in prison.<ref name= NYT2005>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/03/business/media/martha-stewart-gets-new-body-in-newsweek.html?_r=0 | title = Martha Stewart Gets New Body In Newsweek | work=New York Times | author =  Jonathan D.

In the United States, for example, the [[National Press Photographers Association]] (NPPA) established a Code of Ethics which promotes the accuracy of published images, advising that photographers \"do not manipulate images [...] that can mislead viewers or misrepresent subjects.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://nppa.org/code_of_ethics | title = NPPA Code of Ethics | date = January 28, 2017 | publisher=[[National Press Photographers Association]]}}</ref> Infringements of the Code are taken very seriously, especially regarding digital alteration of published photographs, as evidenced by a case in which [[Pulitzer prize]]-nominated photographer [[Allan Detrich]] resigned his post following the revelation that a number of his photographs had been manipulated.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003571795 | title = Blade Editor: Detrich Submitted 79 Altered Photos This Year | work=[[Photo District News]] | date = April 15, 2007 | first = Daryl | last = Lang}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, a Ukrainian photographer Stepan Rudik, winner of the 3rd prize story in Sports Features, has been disqualified due to violation of the rules of the [[World Press Photo of the Year|World Press Photo]] contest. \"After requesting [[Raw image format|RAW-files]] of the series from him, it became clear that an element had been removed from one of the original photographs.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Announcement of disqualification|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/news/2010-03-03/announcement-disqualification|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> As of 2015, up to 20%<ref>{{Cite web|title = World Press Photo Organizer: 20% of Finalists Disqualified|url = http://time.com/3706626/world-press-photo-processing-manipulation-disqualified/|website = TIME.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> of World Press Photo entries that made it to the penultimate round of the contest were disqualified after they were found to have been manipulated or post-processed with rules violations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What counts as manipulation?|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/activities/photo-contest/verification-process/what-counts-as-manipulation|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Use in fashion ===\nThe photo manipulation industry has often been accused of promoting or inciting a distorted and unrealistic image of self; most specifically in younger people. The world of [[glamour photography]] is one specific industry which has been heavily involved with the use of photo manipulation (what many consider to be a concerning element as many people look up to celebrities in search of embodying the 'ideal figure').<ref name=photo/>  Manipulation of a photo to alter a model's appearance can be used to change features such as skin complexion, hair color, body shape, and other features.  Many of the alterations to skin involve removing blemishes through the use of the healing tool in Photoshop.  Photo editors may also alter the color of hair to remove roots or add shine.  Additionally, the model's teeth and eyes may be made to look whiter than they are in reality. [[Cosmetics|Make up]] and [[body piercing|piercings]] can even be edited into pictures to look as though the model was wearing them when the photo was taken.  Through photo editing, the appearance of a model may be drastically changed to mask imperfections.<ref>Metzmacher, Dirk. \"Smashing Magazine.\" Smashing Magazine. N.p., n.d. Web. April 16, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn an article entitled, Confessions of a Retoucher: how the modeling industry is harming women, a professional retoucher who has worked for mega-fashion brands shares the industry's secrets.<ref name=\"Cage\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/confessions-of-a-retoucher-how-the-modelling-industry-is-harming-women-20171006-gyvqf2.html|title=Confessions of a retoucher: how the modelling industry is harming women|last=Cage|first=Carolyn|date=2017-10-06|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>  Along with fixing imperfections like skin wrinkles and smoothing features, the size of the model is manipulated by either adding or subtracting visible weight. Reverse retouching is just as common as making models skinnier, \u201cdistorting the bodies of very thin models to make them appear more robust in a process called reverse retouching. It is almost worse than making someone slimmer because the image claims you can be at an unhealthy weight but still look healthy. In reality, you can't, you have to Photoshop it\".<ref name=\"Cage\"/>  Reverse retouching includes eliminating shadows from protruding bones, adding flesh over body parts, color correcting, and removing hair generated for warmth from extreme weight loss. Professionals are saying that if an image is not labeled \"not retouched,\" then the public can assume that photograph has been modified.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-retouched-photos-impact-our-mental-health-2018-3|title=Here's how retouched photos impact our mental health|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref> As the fashion industry continues to use photos that have been manipulated to idealize body types, there is a need for education about how unreal and unhealthy these images are and the negative implications they are promoting.\n\nA photoshop expert, who edited and altered a lot of images for the fashion industry and wants to remain private, says it's normal to photoshop a model thinner and it doesn't matter how thick or thin the model is. They usually edit away up to 10 kilo's. But in the past 20 years, the practice has changed as more celebrities are on social media and the public is now used to how they look. You can't alter their bodies or faces too much as the public will notice that. The retoucher notes that the industry is made for making a lot of dollars in advertising and that the unrealistic ideals cycle will continue as they have to maintain this. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/photoshop-shock-insider-reveals-fashion-industry-image-editing-practices-20140924-10l97y.html|title=Photoshop shock: Insider reveals fashion industry image editing practices|last=Clun|first=Rachel|date=2014-09-24|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nSince 2012, Seventeen Magazine has let the public know that they stopped photoshopping their models. This happened after 14 year old Julia Bluhm started a petition were she demanded that the magazine use, with a minimum of one, unaltered photo in their spread. The petition got over 84,000 signatures. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://groundswell.org/4-companies-that-refuse-to-photoshop-and-why-that-matters-for-all-genders/|title=4 Companies That Refuse to Photoshop\u2014And Why That Matters For All Genders|last=Amanda Oliver|website=Groundswell|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== In social media ===\nNot only are photos being manipulated by professionals for the media, but also with the rise of social media everyone has easy access to edit photos they post online.  Countless apps have been created to allow smartphone user tools to modify personal images.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/girls-social-media-self-image-partner/index.html|title=How girls use social media to build up, break down self-image|last=Media|first=Caroline Knorr, Common Sense|work=CNN|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>  These apps allow people to edit virtually every aspect in the photo focusing on the face and body represented. With social media users and the younger generation being exposed to an extreme amount of imagery that has been manipulated the consequences have a negative impact as body ideals are unachievable.  Social media has the opportunity to be used as a platform for promoting healthy body image and unedited photos; the need for approval over social media has to be altered in the near future.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nApps like Facetune are used a lot by celebrities and influencers on social media. An example is Khloe Kardashian. It was the bestselling app for Apple in 2017 and it sold around 10 million times copies. Facetune 2 is an upgrade of the original version and has more features like live editing. With live editing it means you can edit your camera before you take a picture. Normally you would edit a picture after you have taken it, but now you can do it before and alter yourself to your liking. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Solon|first=Olivia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate|title=FaceTune is conquering Instagram \u2013 but does it take airbrushing too far?|date=2018-03-09|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== In advertising ===\nPhoto manipulation is not only used by fashion magazines, celebrities and influencers, it's also used in advertisement for Tv commercials and magazines. They use this to make their products or the person look better and more appealing than how they look in reality. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/digital-media-literacy/the-problem-with-photo-manipulation/1/|title=Digital Media Literacy: The Problem with Photo Manipulation|website=GCFGlobal.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> A few tricks that are used with photo manipulation for advertising are: fake grill marks with eye-liner, instead of milk use white glue, to make vegetables look glossy use deodorant, ice-cream melts quick so they use masked potato's. In food photographs we see for example a perfect looking burger, with bright colours. But in reality when you receive the burger, it's very sad looking. But as consumers we accept this, we find it normal that the burger we buy is not the same as in the picture. When a consumer buys a laptop, it's the same one as in the picture. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trulydeeply.com.au/2015/11/food-photography-and-manipulation-in-advertising-why-do-we-accept-knowingly-being-lied-to/|title=Food photography and manipulation in advertising: Why do we accept knowingly being lied to?|date=2015-11-19|website=Truly Deeply - Brand Agency Melbourne|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n===Celebrity opposition===\nPhoto manipulation has triggered negative responses from both viewers and celebrities. This has led to celebrities refusing to have their photos retouched in support of the [[American Medical Association]] that has decided that \"[we] must stop exposing impressionable children and teenagers to advertisements portraying models with body types only attainable with the help of photo editing software\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/fashion/ama-takes-stand-photoshop-medical-association-altering-contributes-unrealistic-expectations-article-1.126921#ixzz1QUW2THCf|title=Photoshop contributes to unrealistic expectations of appropriate body image: AMA|website=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-04-25}}</ref> These include [[Keira Knightley]], [[Brad Pitt]], [[Andy Roddick]], [[Jessica Simpson]], [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Zendaya]].\n\nBrad Pitt had a photographer, [[Chuck Close]], take photos of him that emphasized all of his flaws.

To show how much influence cyberbullying can have on somebodies body image, she edited herself in her videos she posted on her social media. The videos went viral. Cassey also looked for the 100 most-followed influencers, who are female, and noted 22 physical attributes. She classified these as 'Instagram beauty standard'. Examples of these beauty standards are a flat stomach and filled lips. After looking it up and classifying these standards, Cassey applied them to her own pictures and photoshopped them. To make sure her followers on Instagram get more aware about these Instagram beauty standards, she posted the before-and-after and that not everything on Instagram is what it seems to be. Not everybody reacted positive on Cassey's revelation. Some found that she pushed the talent of the influencers and celebrities aside while analyzing these pictures. They also claimed she focused too much on their appearance. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insider.com/influencer-instagram-photoshop-beauty-standards-2019-9|title=A fitness influencer Photoshopped herself to meet the beauty standards of Instagram's most-followed women to prove social media isn't real life|last=Schild|first=Darcy|website=Insider|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n===Corporate opposition===\nMultiple companies have begun taking the initiative to speak out against the use of photo manipulation when advertising their products. Two companies that have done so include [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]] and [[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]]. Dove created the Dove Self-Esteem Fund and also the [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty]] as a way to try to help build confidence in young women. They want to emphasize what is known as real beauty, or untouched photographs, in the media now.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Evolution Video \u2013 Dove Self Esteem Project|website=selfesteem.dove.us|date= 2 June 2013|accessdate=1 May 2015|url=http://selfesteem.dove.us/Articles/Video/Evolution_video_how_images_of_beauty_are_manipulated_by_the_media.aspx}}</ref> Also, Aerie has started their campaign #AerieREAL.

Dr. McAneny made a statement that altering models to such extremes creates unrealistic expectations in children and teenagers regarding body image. He also said that we should stop altering the models so they are not exposed to body types that can be attained only through the use of editing the photos. The American Medical Associations as a whole adopted a policy to work with advertisers to work on setting up guidelines for advertisements to try to limit how much photoshop is used. The goal of this policy is to limit the amount of unrealistic expectations for body image in advertisement.<ref>{{cite web|title=AMA Adopts New Policies at Annual Meeting|date=21 June 2011|website=ama-assn.org|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/a11-new-policies.page}}</ref>\n\n=== Government opposition ===\nGovernments are exerting pressure on advertisers, and are starting to ban photos that are too airbrushed and edited. In the United Kingdom the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] has banned an advertisement by [[Lanc\u00f4me]] featuring [[Julia Roberts]] for being misleading, stating that the flawless skin seen in the photo was too good to be true.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zhang|first=Michael|title=Julia Roberts Makeup Ads Banned in UK for Too Much Photoshop|url=http://www.petapixel.com/2011/07/27/julia-roberts-makeup-ads-banned-in-uk-for-too-much-photoshop/|publisher=PetaPixel|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>  The US is also moving in the direction of banning excessive photo manipulation where a [[CoverGirl]] model's ad was banned because it had exaggerated effects, leading to a misleading representation of the product.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|title=US watchdog bans photoshopping in cosmetics ads|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/109375-us-bans-photoshop-use-in-cosmetics-ads|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, France proceeded to pass a law that battles against the use of unrealistic body images and anorexia in the fashion industry. This includes modeling and photography. The models now have to show they are healthy and have a BMI of over 18 through a note from their doctor. Employers who don't attain to this law will be fined and can serve a jail sentence up to 6 months. When a creator of a photograph does not disclose that the picture is edited or retouched, no matter how small the edit, they also can get a fine or 30% of the costs of what they used to create their ad. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petapixel.com/2015/12/22/france-bans-too-thin-fashion-models-demands-that-photoshopping-be-labeled/|title=France Bans Too-Thin Fashion Models, Demands That Photoshopping Be Labeled|website=petapixel.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n===Support===\nSome editors of magazine companies do not view manipulating their [[cover model]]s as an issue. In an interview with the editor of the French magazine ''[[Marie Claire]]'', she stated that their readers are not idiots and that they can tell when a model has been retouched. Also, some who support photo manipulation in the media state that the altered photographs are not the issue, but that it is the expectations that viewers have that they fail to meet, such as wanting to have the same body as a celebrity on the cover of their favorite magazine.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Defense of Photoshop: Why Retouching Isn't As Evil As Everyone Thinks|work= The Cut|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2010/08/photoshop_retouching.html}}</ref>\n\n===Opinion polling===\nSurveys have been done to see how photo manipulation affects society and to see what society thinks of it. One survey was done by a fashion store in the United Kingdom, [[New Look (company)|New Look]], and it showed that 90% of the individuals surveyed would prefer seeing a wider variety of body shapes in media. This would involve them wanting to see cover models that are not all thin, but some with more curves than others. The survey also talked about how readers view the use of photo manipulation. One statistic stated that 15% of the readers believed that the cover images are accurate depictions of the model in reality. Also, they found that 33% of women who were surveyed are aiming for a body that is impossible for them to attain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women Need Further Educating Into Extent of Digital Manipulation of Mo|website=prweb.com|date= 26 November 2013|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/11/prweb11361783.htm}}</ref>\n\nDove also did a survey to see how photo manipulation affects the self-esteem of females. In doing this, they found that 80% of the women surveyed felt insecure when seeing photos of celebrities in the media. Of the women surveyed who had lower self-esteem, 71% of them do not believe that their appearance is pretty or stylish enough in comparison to cover models.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Self Esteem Act: Parents Push for Anti-Photoshop Law in U.S. to Protect Teens from Unrealistic Body Image Ideals|publisher=Daily Mail Online|work=Associated Newspapers|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2048375/Self-Esteem-Act-US-parents-push-anti-Photoshop-laws-advertising.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Social and cultural implications ===\n\nThe growing popularity of image manipulation has raised concern as to whether it allows for unrealistic images to be portrayed to the public. In her article \"[[On Photography]]\" (1977), [[Susan Sontag]] discusses the objectivity, or lack thereof, in photography, concluding that \"photographs, which fiddle with the scale of the world, themselves get reduced, blown up, cropped, retouched, doctored and tricked out\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Sontag | first = Susan | authorlink = Susan Sontag | year = 1977 | title = [[On Photography]] | page = 4}}</ref>  A practice widely used in the magazine industry, the use of photo manipulation on an already subjective photograph, creates a constructed reality for the individual and it can become difficult to differentiate fact from fiction. With the potential to alter body image, debate continues as to whether manipulated images, particularly those in magazines, contribute to self-esteem issues in both men and women.\n\nIn today's world, photo manipulation has a positive impact by developing the creativity of one's mind or maybe a negative one by removing the art and beauty of capturing something so magnificent and natural or the way it should be. According to ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'', \"Photoshopping and airbrushing, many believe, are now an inherent part of the beauty industry, as are makeup, lighting and styling\".  In a way, these image alterations are \"selling\" actual people to the masses to affect responses, reactions, and emotions toward these cultural icons.<ref>{{cite web|last=L.

In September 2019, around 15.000 deepfake videos were found online by a firm named Deeptrace. In those videos, 99% were faces used from female celebrities and put on the body's of porn stars. This new technique is used with just a couple of photos and will be used as revenge porn by anybody, not just by celebreties. A professor of law named Danielle Citron says: 'Deepfake technology is being weaponised against women.' Deepfake looks realistic even when it's made completely from fictional photos. It can also manipulate voices and let somebody say something they would never say. That makes it also very convincing. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Sample|first=Ian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/13/what-are-deepfakes-and-how-can-you-spot-them|title=What are deepfakes \u2013 and how can you spot them?|date=2020-01-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n==\"Photoshop\" as a verb==\n<!--[[Adobe Photoshop#Cultural impact]] links to this section via {{further}}.

Some photo manipulations are considered skillful artwork while others are frowned upon as unethical practices, especially when used to deceive the public.  Other examples include being used for political [[propaganda]], or to make a product or person look better, or simply for entertainment purposes or harmless pranks.\n\nDepending on the application and intent, some photo manipulations are considered an [[art form]] because it involves the creation of unique images and in some instances, signature expressions of art by photographic artists.  For example, [[Ansel Adams]] employed some of the more common manipulations using [[Burning and dodging|darkroom exposure techniques]], burning (darkening) and dodging (lightening) a photograph.<ref name=Dziamba>{{cite web | url = https://whitherthebook.wordpress.com/2013/02/27/ansel-adams-and-photography-before-photoshop/ | title = Ansel Adams, and Photography Before Photoshop | author = Jack Dziamba | date = February 27, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"PBS\">{{cite interview | title=Artbeat | date=November 29, 2012 | accessdate=January 30, 2016 | author=Mia Fineman | interviewer=Tom Legro | work=PBS Newshour | publisher=WPBT2 | location=South Florida | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/slide-show-what-did-we-do-before-photoshop/}}</ref>  Other examples of photo manipulation include retouching photographs using ink or paint, [[airbrushing]], [[double exposure (photography)|double exposure]], piecing photos or negatives together in the darkroom, scratching [[instant film]]s, or through the use of software-based manipulation tools applied to digital images.  There are a number of software applications available for digital image manipulation, ranging from professional applications to very basic imaging software for casual users.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ulysses_S._Grant_at_City_Point.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Ulysses S.

While the equipment and technology progressed over time, it was not until the late 20th century that photography evolved into the digital realm.

In the United States, for example, the [[National Press Photographers Association]] (NPPA) established a Code of Ethics which promotes the accuracy of published images, advising that photographers \"do not manipulate images [...] that can mislead viewers or misrepresent subjects.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://nppa.org/code_of_ethics | title = NPPA Code of Ethics | date = January 28, 2017 | publisher=[[National Press Photographers Association]]}}</ref> Infringements of the Code are taken very seriously, especially regarding digital alteration of published photographs, as evidenced by a case in which [[Pulitzer prize]]-nominated photographer [[Allan Detrich]] resigned his post following the revelation that a number of his photographs had been manipulated.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003571795 | title = Blade Editor: Detrich Submitted 79 Altered Photos This Year | work=[[Photo District News]] | date = April 15, 2007 | first = Daryl | last = Lang}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, a Ukrainian photographer Stepan Rudik, winner of the 3rd prize story in Sports Features, has been disqualified due to violation of the rules of the [[World Press Photo of the Year|World Press Photo]] contest. \"After requesting [[Raw image format|RAW-files]] of the series from him, it became clear that an element had been removed from one of the original photographs.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Announcement of disqualification|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/news/2010-03-03/announcement-disqualification|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> As of 2015, up to 20%<ref>{{Cite web|title = World Press Photo Organizer: 20% of Finalists Disqualified|url = http://time.com/3706626/world-press-photo-processing-manipulation-disqualified/|website = TIME.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> of World Press Photo entries that made it to the penultimate round of the contest were disqualified after they were found to have been manipulated or post-processed with rules violations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What counts as manipulation?|url = http://www.worldpressphoto.org/activities/photo-contest/verification-process/what-counts-as-manipulation|website = World Press Photo|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Use in fashion ===\nThe photo manipulation industry has often been accused of promoting or inciting a distorted and unrealistic image of self; most specifically in younger people. The world of [[glamour photography]] is one specific industry which has been heavily involved with the use of photo manipulation (what many consider to be a concerning element as many people look up to celebrities in search of embodying the 'ideal figure').<ref name=photo/>  Manipulation of a photo to alter a model's appearance can be used to change features such as skin complexion, hair color, body shape, and other features.  Many of the alterations to skin involve removing blemishes through the use of the healing tool in Photoshop.  Photo editors may also alter the color of hair to remove roots or add shine.  Additionally, the model's teeth and eyes may be made to look whiter than they are in reality. [[Cosmetics|Make up]] and [[body piercing|piercings]] can even be edited into pictures to look as though the model was wearing them when the photo was taken.  Through photo editing, the appearance of a model may be drastically changed to mask imperfections.<ref>Metzmacher, Dirk. \"Smashing Magazine.\" Smashing Magazine. N.p., n.d. Web. April 16, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn an article entitled, Confessions of a Retoucher: how the modeling industry is harming women, a professional retoucher who has worked for mega-fashion brands shares the industry's secrets.<ref name=\"Cage\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/confessions-of-a-retoucher-how-the-modelling-industry-is-harming-women-20171006-gyvqf2.html|title=Confessions of a retoucher: how the modelling industry is harming women|last=Cage|first=Carolyn|date=2017-10-06|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>  Along with fixing imperfections like skin wrinkles and smoothing features, the size of the model is manipulated by either adding or subtracting visible weight. Reverse retouching is just as common as making models skinnier, \u201cdistorting the bodies of very thin models to make them appear more robust in a process called reverse retouching. It is almost worse than making someone slimmer because the image claims you can be at an unhealthy weight but still look healthy. In reality, you can't, you have to Photoshop it\".<ref name=\"Cage\"/>  Reverse retouching includes eliminating shadows from protruding bones, adding flesh over body parts, color correcting, and removing hair generated for warmth from extreme weight loss. Professionals are saying that if an image is not labeled \"not retouched,\" then the public can assume that photograph has been modified.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/how-retouched-photos-impact-our-mental-health-2018-3|title=Here's how retouched photos impact our mental health|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref> As the fashion industry continues to use photos that have been manipulated to idealize body types, there is a need for education about how unreal and unhealthy these images are and the negative implications they are promoting.\n\nA photoshop expert, who edited and altered a lot of images for the fashion industry and wants to remain private, says it's normal to photoshop a model thinner and it doesn't matter how thick or thin the model is. They usually edit away up to 10 kilo's. But in the past 20 years, the practice has changed as more celebrities are on social media and the public is now used to how they look. You can't alter their bodies or faces too much as the public will notice that. The retoucher notes that the industry is made for making a lot of dollars in advertising and that the unrealistic ideals cycle will continue as they have to maintain this. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/beauty/photoshop-shock-insider-reveals-fashion-industry-image-editing-practices-20140924-10l97y.html|title=Photoshop shock: Insider reveals fashion industry image editing practices|last=Clun|first=Rachel|date=2014-09-24|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nSince 2012, Seventeen Magazine has let the public know that they stopped photoshopping their models. This happened after 14 year old Julia Bluhm started a petition were she demanded that the magazine use, with a minimum of one, unaltered photo in their spread. The petition got over 84,000 signatures. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://groundswell.org/4-companies-that-refuse-to-photoshop-and-why-that-matters-for-all-genders/|title=4 Companies That Refuse to Photoshop\u2014And Why That Matters For All Genders|last=Amanda Oliver|website=Groundswell|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== In social media ===\nNot only are photos being manipulated by professionals for the media, but also with the rise of social media everyone has easy access to edit photos they post online.  Countless apps have been created to allow smartphone user tools to modify personal images.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/12/health/girls-social-media-self-image-partner/index.html|title=How girls use social media to build up, break down self-image|last=Media|first=Caroline Knorr, Common Sense|work=CNN|access-date=2018-10-30}}</ref>  These apps allow people to edit virtually every aspect in the photo focusing on the face and body represented. With social media users and the younger generation being exposed to an extreme amount of imagery that has been manipulated the consequences have a negative impact as body ideals are unachievable.  Social media has the opportunity to be used as a platform for promoting healthy body image and unedited photos; the need for approval over social media has to be altered in the near future.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nApps like Facetune are used a lot by celebrities and influencers on social media. An example is Khloe Kardashian. It was the bestselling app for Apple in 2017 and it sold around 10 million times copies. Facetune 2 is an upgrade of the original version and has more features like live editing. With live editing it means you can edit your camera before you take a picture. Normally you would edit a picture after you have taken it, but now you can do it before and alter yourself to your liking. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Solon|first=Olivia|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/mar/09/facetune-photoshopping-app-instagram-body-image-debate|title=FaceTune is conquering Instagram \u2013 but does it take airbrushing too far?|date=2018-03-09|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-04|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== In advertising ===\nPhoto manipulation is not only used by fashion magazines, celebrities and influencers, it's also used in advertisement for Tv commercials and magazines. They use this to make their products or the person look better and more appealing than how they look in reality. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/digital-media-literacy/the-problem-with-photo-manipulation/1/|title=Digital Media Literacy: The Problem with Photo Manipulation|website=GCFGlobal.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> A few tricks that are used with photo manipulation for advertising are: fake grill marks with eye-liner, instead of milk use white glue, to make vegetables look glossy use deodorant, ice-cream melts quick so they use masked potato's. In food photographs we see for example a perfect looking burger, with bright colours. But in reality when you receive the burger, it's very sad looking. But as consumers we accept this, we find it normal that the burger we buy is not the same as in the picture. When a consumer buys a laptop, it's the same one as in the picture. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trulydeeply.com.au/2015/11/food-photography-and-manipulation-in-advertising-why-do-we-accept-knowingly-being-lied-to/|title=Food photography and manipulation in advertising: Why do we accept knowingly being lied to?|date=2015-11-19|website=Truly Deeply - Brand Agency Melbourne|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n===Celebrity opposition===\nPhoto manipulation has triggered negative responses from both viewers and celebrities.

To show how much influence cyberbullying can have on somebodies body image, she edited herself in her videos she posted on her social media. The videos went viral. Cassey also looked for the 100 most-followed influencers, who are female, and noted 22 physical attributes. She classified these as 'Instagram beauty standard'. Examples of these beauty standards are a flat stomach and filled lips. After looking it up and classifying these standards, Cassey applied them to her own pictures and photoshopped them. To make sure her followers on Instagram get more aware about these Instagram beauty standards, she posted the before-and-after and that not everything on Instagram is what it seems to be. Not everybody reacted positive on Cassey's revelation. Some found that she pushed the talent of the influencers and celebrities aside while analyzing these pictures. They also claimed she focused too much on their appearance. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insider.com/influencer-instagram-photoshop-beauty-standards-2019-9|title=A fitness influencer Photoshopped herself to meet the beauty standards of Instagram's most-followed women to prove social media isn't real life|last=Schild|first=Darcy|website=Insider|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n===Corporate opposition===\nMultiple companies have begun taking the initiative to speak out against the use of photo manipulation when advertising their products. Two companies that have done so include [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]] and [[Aerie (American Eagle Outfitters)|Aerie]]. Dove created the Dove Self-Esteem Fund and also the [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty]] as a way to try to help build confidence in young women. They want to emphasize what is known as real beauty, or untouched photographs, in the media now.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Evolution Video \u2013 Dove Self Esteem Project|website=selfesteem.dove.us|date= 2 June 2013|accessdate=1 May 2015|url=http://selfesteem.dove.us/Articles/Video/Evolution_video_how_images_of_beauty_are_manipulated_by_the_media.aspx}}</ref> Also, Aerie has started their campaign #AerieREAL.

Dr. McAneny made a statement that altering models to such extremes creates unrealistic expectations in children and teenagers regarding body image. He also said that we should stop altering the models so they are not exposed to body types that can be attained only through the use of editing the photos. The American Medical Associations as a whole adopted a policy to work with advertisers to work on setting up guidelines for advertisements to try to limit how much photoshop is used. The goal of this policy is to limit the amount of unrealistic expectations for body image in advertisement.<ref>{{cite web|title=AMA Adopts New Policies at Annual Meeting|date=21 June 2011|website=ama-assn.org|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/a11-new-policies.page}}</ref>\n\n=== Government opposition ===\nGovernments are exerting pressure on advertisers, and are starting to ban photos that are too airbrushed and edited. In the United Kingdom the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] has banned an advertisement by [[Lanc\u00f4me]] featuring [[Julia Roberts]] for being misleading, stating that the flawless skin seen in the photo was too good to be true.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zhang|first=Michael|title=Julia Roberts Makeup Ads Banned in UK for Too Much Photoshop|url=http://www.petapixel.com/2011/07/27/julia-roberts-makeup-ads-banned-in-uk-for-too-much-photoshop/|publisher=PetaPixel|accessdate=July 27, 2011}}</ref>  The US is also moving in the direction of banning excessive photo manipulation where a [[CoverGirl]] model's ad was banned because it had exaggerated effects, leading to a misleading representation of the product.<ref>{{cite web|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|title=US watchdog bans photoshopping in cosmetics ads|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/109375-us-bans-photoshop-use-in-cosmetics-ads|accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, France proceeded to pass a law that battles against the use of unrealistic body images and anorexia in the fashion industry. This includes modeling and photography. The models now have to show they are healthy and have a BMI of over 18 through a note from their doctor. Employers who don't attain to this law will be fined and can serve a jail sentence up to 6 months. When a creator of a photograph does not disclose that the picture is edited or retouched, no matter how small the edit, they also can get a fine or 30% of the costs of what they used to create their ad. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petapixel.com/2015/12/22/france-bans-too-thin-fashion-models-demands-that-photoshopping-be-labeled/|title=France Bans Too-Thin Fashion Models, Demands That Photoshopping Be Labeled|website=petapixel.com|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n===Support===\nSome editors of magazine companies do not view manipulating their [[cover model]]s as an issue. In an interview with the editor of the French magazine ''[[Marie Claire]]'', she stated that their readers are not idiots and that they can tell when a model has been retouched. Also, some who support photo manipulation in the media state that the altered photographs are not the issue, but that it is the expectations that viewers have that they fail to meet, such as wanting to have the same body as a celebrity on the cover of their favorite magazine.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Defense of Photoshop: Why Retouching Isn't As Evil As Everyone Thinks|work= The Cut|date=29 August 2010|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2010/08/photoshop_retouching.html}}</ref>\n\n===Opinion polling===\nSurveys have been done to see how photo manipulation affects society and to see what society thinks of it. One survey was done by a fashion store in the United Kingdom, [[New Look (company)|New Look]], and it showed that 90% of the individuals surveyed would prefer seeing a wider variety of body shapes in media. This would involve them wanting to see cover models that are not all thin, but some with more curves than others. The survey also talked about how readers view the use of photo manipulation. One statistic stated that 15% of the readers believed that the cover images are accurate depictions of the model in reality. Also, they found that 33% of women who were surveyed are aiming for a body that is impossible for them to attain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women Need Further Educating Into Extent of Digital Manipulation of Mo|website=prweb.com|date= 26 November 2013|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/11/prweb11361783.htm}}</ref>\n\nDove also did a survey to see how photo manipulation affects the self-esteem of females. In doing this, they found that 80% of the women surveyed felt insecure when seeing photos of celebrities in the media. Of the women surveyed who had lower self-esteem, 71% of them do not believe that their appearance is pretty or stylish enough in comparison to cover models.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Self Esteem Act: Parents Push for Anti-Photoshop Law in U.S. to Protect Teens from Unrealistic Body Image Ideals|publisher=Daily Mail Online|work=Associated Newspapers|date=12 October 2011|accessdate=19 April 2015|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2048375/Self-Esteem-Act-US-parents-push-anti-Photoshop-laws-advertising.html}}</ref>\n\n=== Social and cultural implications ===\n\nThe growing popularity of image manipulation has raised concern as to whether it allows for unrealistic images to be portrayed to the public. In her article \"[[On Photography]]\" (1977), [[Susan Sontag]] discusses the objectivity, or lack thereof, in photography, concluding that \"photographs, which fiddle with the scale of the world, themselves get reduced, blown up, cropped, retouched, doctored and tricked out\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Sontag | first = Susan | authorlink = Susan Sontag | year = 1977 | title = [[On Photography]] | page = 4}}</ref>  A practice widely used in the magazine industry, the use of photo manipulation on an already subjective photograph, creates a constructed reality for the individual and it can become difficult to differentiate fact from fiction. With the potential to alter body image, debate continues as to whether manipulated images, particularly those in magazines, contribute to self-esteem issues in both men and women.\n\nIn today's world, photo manipulation has a positive impact by developing the creativity of one's mind or maybe a negative one by removing the art and beauty of capturing something so magnificent and natural or the way it should be. According to ''[[HuffPost|The Huffington Post]]'', \"Photoshopping and airbrushing, many believe, are now an inherent part of the beauty industry, as are makeup, lighting and styling\".  In a way, these image alterations are \"selling\" actual people to the masses to affect responses, reactions, and emotions toward these cultural icons.<ref>{{cite web|last=L.

In September 2019, around 15.000 deepfake videos were found online by a firm named Deeptrace. In those videos, 99% were faces used from female celebrities and put on the body's of porn stars. This new technique is used with just a couple of photos and will be used as revenge porn by anybody, not just by celebreties. A professor of law named Danielle Citron says: 'Deepfake technology is being weaponised against women.' Deepfake looks realistic even when it's made completely from fictional photos. It can also manipulate voices and let somebody say something they would never say.

The identifiers incorporate literal values of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] in an interleaved notation (producing grid resolutions of 10, 1, 0.1 degrees, etc.), together with additional digits that support intermediate grid resolutions of 5, 0.5, 0.05 degrees, etc. The system was initially designed to represent data \"footprints\" or spatial extents in a more flexible manner than a standard [[minimum bounding rectangle]], and to support \"lightweight\", text-based spatial querying; it can also provide a set of identifiers for grid cells used for assembly, storage and analysis of spatially organised data. Dataset extents expressed in c-squares notation can be visualised using a web-based utility, the c-squares mapper, an online instance of which is currently provided by [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia.

Such queries are computationally expensive so it can be beneficial to pre-process (index) the data in some manner that reduces the inherent dimensionality from two to one dimension, for example as labelled cells of a grid; the grid labels can then be [[database index|indexed]] by standard, one dimensional methods for rapid search and retrieval,<ref>Rigaux, P., Scholl, M., and Voisard, A. 2002. Spatial Databases - with application to GIS. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 410pp.</ref> and/or searched by simple alphanumeric text searches. C-squares is an example of such a grid where the cell identifiers are designed to be human- as well as machine-readable, and to be concordant with recognizable and commonly intervals of latitude and longitude.\n\n===Dataset footprints===\n[[Geographic data and information|Spatial data]], that is, data associated with particular geographic locations on the earth, have spatial \"footprints\" that ideally are recorded in metadata systems or data catalogues, to support spatial searching of the resources in question.<ref name = \"Hill_2006\">Hill, Linda (2006). ''Georeferencing: The Geographic Associations of Information''. MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. and London, England, 260 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-262-08354-6}}</ref> A \"basic\" generalization of any data footprint is the minimum bounding rectangle or MBR, that is, the smallest set of boundaries of latitude and longitude that completely contain the data. Such stored rectangles are relatively simple to query as a mathematical operation (look for overlap with an input \"search\" rectangle) but, with real world data, may not be a good surrogate for the true data \"footprint\" if the latter contains disjoint or sparsely populated data items, items on a diagonal line, or items with significant \"holes\", such as a vessel track around a continent.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /> Representation as a set of smaller \"tiles\", such those denoted by c-square codes at an appropriate resolution, can more accurately reflect the shape of such non-rectangular and/or non-contiguous datasets.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /><ref name = \"Hill_2006\" />\n\n===Data binning===\n{{Main|Data binning}}\n\"Binning\" describes the process of converting continuously variable data (in the present case, spatial locations in degrees of latitude and longitude) into a set of discrete \"bins\" in order to apply the indexing and subsequent search/retrieval processes, other processing and reporting, etc. The optimal size of the spatial data \"bins\" can depend on the user's requirements (e.g. geographic coverage), desire for handling large vs. small datasets (which can affect the time required for processing or production of on-demand maps) and density of available data (with sparse input data, many \"bins\" may end up being empty). Large \"bins\" will have smaller data handling requirements and smooth out data deficiencies, but will result in a loss of resolution of fine scale data; small \"bins\" can result in large quantities of data to be handled (for example, a global coverage at 0.1 degree resolution requires over 6 million grid cells) which may be too much for easy handling. To date, 0.5 degree cells (50\u00d750 km nominal size) have been found to be a reasonable compromise between resolution and data storage requirements for global coverages (259,200 cells), e.g. as used for Aquamaps,<ref name = \"Ready_et_al_2010\" /> while for more local applications, either 0.5 or 0.1 degree cells may be useful.\n\n===Data reduction===\n{{Main|data reduction}}\nOne advantage of binning spatial data as described above is that it offers the potential for [[data reduction]] in some use cases: for example rather than storing (say) hundreds of raw data points within the same bin, the data can be represented as an average value and/or number of data points held, or just as presence/absence (for example as a range map). By this means, the quantity of information required to be stored in the spatial index and associated information can be substantially reduced in many cases, with a concomitant improvement in performance (speed of spatial queries and result mapping as desired).\n\n===Hierarchical representation===\n{{Main|Discrete global grid#Hierarchical grids}}\nAs a property of a discrete global grid, hierarchical notation ensures that the geocodes for finer resolutions of the mesh incorporate those of all their parents, permitting rapid search and/or data aggregation at any desired equal or higher level of the hierarchy. In the c-squares case, the code is extended by additional alphanumeric characters as the spatial resolution increases, with the corollary that resolution can be decreased if desired, merely by truncating the code by the relevant amount.\n\n[[File:Sphere wireframe.svg|thumb|An equal angle spherical (global) grid, represented in a \"real world\" (orthographic) perspective.]]\n===Equal angle grids===\nEqual angle grids (the class that includes c-squares) have the advantage that transformation of spatial data (for example as simple coordinates of latitude and longitude) in and out of the grid notation can be simple, since the latitude\u2013longitude grid is itself equal angle.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/85ec/ec57454e66e3326b4aaf834ab9c5fe4e073c.pdf |last1=Kimerling |first1=A.

By contrast, equal area grids attempt to preserve a constant area for all cells at the same hierarchical level (resolution), at the expense of losing concordance with familiar lines of latitude and/or longitude.\n\n===Regional (local/national) vs. global grids===\nLocal and/or national grids have been developed for use within a number of countries, for example the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|UK National Grid]] has been in use since 1946,<ref name = \"Nature_1946\">{{Cite journal |url=https://tos.org/oceanography/article/c-squares-a-new-spatial-indexing-system-and-its-applicability-to-the-descri |last=Anonymous |first=|year=1946 |title=The National Grid of the Ordnance Survey |journal=Nature |volume=158 |issue= |pages=510 |doi=10.1038/158510a0}}</ref> while a separate system is in use for [[Irish grid reference system|Ireland]]. Discontinuities occur where such grids meet or overlap, and some areas (for example the more offshore portions of surrounding seas and the [[Channel Islands]]) are not covered at all. Global grids offer a solution to this problem (providing standard treatment for all areas of the globe) and also offer a potential format for collation of cross-national data into a single repository for analysis and reporting, for example see Vanhee ''et al''., 2018.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" />\n\n==The c-squares global grid notation==\n[[File:WMO-squares-global.gif|thumb|Global coverage of 10x10 degree World Meteorological Organization (WMO) squares (= c-squares 10-degree grid)]]\n\n===Initial 10 degree squares===\n10-degree c-squares are specified as being identical to equivalent World Meteteorological Organization (WMO) square codes, refer illustration at right. These squares are aligned with 10-degree subdivisions of the global latitude\u2013longitude grid, which for c-squares use is specified as employing the [[World Geodetic System#WGS84|WGS84 datum]]. WMO (10 degree) squares are encoded with four digits, in the series 1xxx, 3xxx, 5xxx and 7xxx.<ref name=\"NODC_1998\" /> The leading digit indicates the \"global quadrant\" with 1 for north-east (latitude and longitude are both positive), 3 for south-east (latitude is negative and longitude positive), 5 for south-west (latitude and longitude are both negative) and 7 for north-west (latitude is positive and longitude negative). The next digit, 0 through 8, corresponds to the tens of latitude degrees either north or south; while the remaining 2 digits, 00 through 17, correspond to the tens of longitude degrees either east or west (by specification, 0 is treated as positive). Thus the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 0,0 (latitude,longitude) is encoded 1000, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 0 and 10 degrees north (actually, 0 and 9.999...) and 0 and 9.999... degrees east; the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 80 N, 170 E is encoded 1817, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 80 and 90 degrees north and 170 and 179.999... degrees east.\n\n===Subsequent recursive subdivision===\nC-squares extends the initial WMO 10\u00d710 square notation via a recursive series of \"cycles\", each 3 digits long (the final one may be 1 digit), separated by the colon character, the number of characters (and cycles) indicating the resolution encoded, as per these examples:\n*1000 ... 10\u00d710 degree square (up to 1000\u00d71000 km nominal)\n*1000:1 ... 5\u00d75 degree square (up to 500\u00d7500 km nominal)\n*1000:100 ... 1\u00d71 degree square (up to 100\u00d7100 km nominal)\n*1000:100:1 ... 0.5\u00d70.5 degree square (up to 50\u00d750km nominal)\n*1000:100:100 ... 0.1\u00d70.1 degree square (up to 10\u00d710 km nominal)\n*1000:100:100:1 ... 0.05\u00d70.05 degree square (up to 5\u00d75km nominal)\n(etc.)\n\nThe nominal sizes given reflect the fact that at the equator, 1 degree of both latitude and longitude correspond to around 110 km, with the actual value for longitude declining between there and the poles, where it becomes zero (latitude actual: 110.567 km at the equator, 111.699 km at the poles; longitude actual: 111.320 km at the equator, 78.847 km at latitude \u00b145 degrees, 0 km at the poles); at a sample northern hemisphere latitude e.g. that of [[London]] (51.5 degrees north), a 1\u00d71 degree square measures approximately 111\u00d769 km.<ref>U.S. National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center: [https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gccalc.shtml Latitude/Longitude Distance Calculator]</ref>\n\n[[File:C-squares geocode principle - SE intermediate quadrant example.gif|thumb|C-squares recursive subdivision principle - intermediate quadrant example (south-east global quadrant)]]\nTo produce the 1 or 3 digits in any cycle following the initial 4-digit, 10-degree square identifier, first an \"intermediate quadrant\", 1 through 4 is designated (refer diagram at right), where 1 indicates low absolute values of both latitude and longitude (regardless of sign), 2 indicates low longitude and high latitude, 3 indicates high latitude and low longitude, and 4 indicates high values for both; \"low\" and high\" being taken from the relevant portion of the data to be gridded (for example within the 10 degree cell extending from 10 to 20 degrees, 10 is treated as low and 19 as high). This leading digit in a cycle is then followed simply by the next applicable digit for first latitude and then longitude: thus an input value of latitude +11.0, longitude +12.0 degrees will be encoded as the 5 degree c-square code 1101:1 and the 1 degree code 1101:112. Inspection of this code will show that the input latitude value can be recovered directly from the digits 1<u>1</u>01:1<u>1</u>2 while the longitude is included as 11<u>01</u>:11<u>2</u>; the sign for these is both positive, as indicated by the first digit of the leading 4 (1 in this case, indicating the north east global quadrant).\n\nFrom 2002 onwards (still current at 2020), an online \"[http://www.marine.csiro.au/marq/csq_builder.init latlong to c-squares conversion page]\" is available at the website of CSIRO Marine Research (now CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere) which will convert input values of latitude and longitude to the equivalent c-square code at user selectable resolutions from 10 to 0.1 degree cell size. Alternatively it is a comparatively simple task to program from first principles (or construct as, for example, a [[Microsoft Excel]] worksheet) according to the c-squares specification;<ref name=\"c-squares_spec\">[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/spec1-1.htm C-squares Specification - Version 1.1 (December 2005)]</ref> an example is available [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/c-squares-encoder.xls here].\n\n==C-squares strings, and the c-squares mapper==\nA set of c-squares (contiguous or non contiguous) can be represented as a concatenated list of individual square codes, separated by the \"pipe\" (|) character, thus: 7500:110:3|7500:110:1|1500:110:3|1500:110:1 (etc.). This set of squares can then serve as an indication of a dataset extent, similar in function (but simpler to specify) to a MultiPolygon in the [[Well-known text representation of geometry]], the functional difference being that defined points forming the boundary of a polygon can be continuously variable, while those for the c-square boundaries are constrained to fixed intervals from the grid square resolution in use. If these strings are stored, for example as \"long text\" within a field of a conventional text storage system (e.g. spreadsheet, database, etc.) they can be used for the operation of spatial searches (see following section/s).\n\nC-squares strings can also be used directly as input to an instance of the \"c-squares mapper\", a web-based utility in operation since 2002 at CSIRO in Australia (under the domain obis.org.au) and also at other global locations. To visualize the position of any set of squares on a map, the current syntax to address an installation of the \"c-squares mapper\" is (e.g.):\n\n[http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2|3112:370:2|3112:360:4|3111:360:3|3110:469:3|3112:360:3|3111:469:2|3111:469:1|3110:469:1|3111:458:4|3111:458:3|3110:458:2|3111:457:2|3111:247:3|3110:248:3|3111:246:2|3110:247:2|3111:235:4|3111:134:1|3110:237:1|3112:235:2|3112:225:3|3111:122:4|3110:227:3|3112:124:4|3111:121:2|3112:124:1|3112:122:2|3112:123:1|3110:216:4|3112:112:3|3111:110:3|3110:217:1|3110:216:2|3110:205:3|3110:205:1|3110:206:2|3110:205:2|3010:496:4|3010:496:2 http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2| (etc.)].\n\n[[Image:Aquamap-mola-mola-20091106-med-res.png|right|240px|thumb|[[AquaMaps|AquaMap]] for ''Mola mola'', the ocean sunfish, generated via the c-squares mapper at 0.5 degree square resolution]]\nIt should be noted here that the above call to the c-squares mapper is a simple one, with only a single parameter (a single c-squares string) which produces a simple \"default map\"; the mapper is in fact quite highly customizable, capable of accepting up to seven c-squares strings concurrently, plotting them in user-specified colours, with a choice of empty of filled squares, user-selectable base map, etc. etc.; a full list of available input parameters is provided on the mapper \"technical information\" page.<ref>[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/mapper-tech.htm CMAR c-squares Mapper - Technical Information] page</ref> A more sophisticated map produced using a larger number of available parameters is the colour-coded example at right ([[AquaMaps|AquaMap]], i.e. modelled distribution, for the ocean sunfish).\n\n==Spatial searching==\nIn a system that uses c-squares codes as units of spatial indexing, a text-based search on any of these square identifiers will retrieve data associated with the relevant square. If a wildcard search is supported (for example in the case that the wildcard character is a percent sign), a search on \"7500%\" will retrieve all data items in that ten degree square, a search on \"7500:1%\" will retrieve all data items in that five degree square, etc.\n\nThe asterisk character \"*\" has a special (reserved) meaning in c-squares notation, being a \"compact\" notation indicating that all finer cells within a higher level cell are included, to the level of resolution indicated by the number of asterisks. In the example above, \"7500:*\" would indicate that all 4 five-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, \"7500:***\" would indicate that all 100 one-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, etc. This approach enables the filling of contiguous blocks of cells with an economy of characters in many cases (a form of [[data compression]]), that is useful for efficient storage and transfer of c-squares codes as required.\n\n==Spatial data exchange and assembly==\nExamples of the use of c-squares for multi-national data reporting and assembly include the use of 0.05 \u00d7 0.05 degree c-squares for VMS (vessel monitoring systems) data and fishing logbook data for [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]], the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea,<ref name = \"ICES_2019\" >International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (2019) ICES Technical Guidelines: 16.3.3.3 Spatial distribution of fishing effort and physical disturbance of benthic habitats by mobile bottom trawl fishing gear using VMS. doi: 10.17895/ices.advice.4683 1 Available at https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Guidelines%20and%20Policies/16.03.03.03_Guidelines_Vessel_Monitoring_Systems_Data.pdf</ref> and the reporting and collation of fishing activity by member states into 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 degree c-squares by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) of the European Commission.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" /><ref name = \"Holmes_et_al_2018\">Holmes, S.J., Gibin, M., Scott, F., Zanzi, A., ''et al.''

The identifiers incorporate literal values of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] in an interleaved notation (producing grid resolutions of 10, 1, 0.1 degrees, etc.), together with additional digits that support intermediate grid resolutions of 5, 0.5, 0.05 degrees, etc. The system was initially designed to represent data \"footprints\" or spatial extents in a more flexible manner than a standard [[minimum bounding rectangle]], and to support \"lightweight\", text-based spatial querying; it can also provide a set of identifiers for grid cells used for assembly, storage and analysis of spatially organised data. Dataset extents expressed in c-squares notation can be visualised using a web-based utility, the c-squares mapper, an online instance of which is currently provided by [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia. C-squares codes and associated published software are free to use and the software is released under version 2 of the GNU General Public License (GPL), a licence of the Free Software Foundation.\n\n==History==\nThe c-squares method was developed by Tony Rees at [[CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere]] in Australia (then \"CSIRO Marine Research\") in 2001-2, initially as a method for spatial indexing, rapid query, and compact storage and visualization of dataset spatial \"footprints\" in an agency-specific [[Geospatial metadata|metadata directory]] (data catalogue);.<ref name=\"about_c-squares\">CSIRO Marine Research, 2002: [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/about-csquares.htm About C-Squares.]</ref><ref name = \"Rees_2002\">Rees, Tony (2002): \"C-squares\u2013a new metadata element for improved spatial querying and representation of spatial dataset coverage in metadata records\".

Such queries are computationally expensive so it can be beneficial to pre-process (index) the data in some manner that reduces the inherent dimensionality from two to one dimension, for example as labelled cells of a grid; the grid labels can then be [[database index|indexed]] by standard, one dimensional methods for rapid search and retrieval,<ref>Rigaux, P., Scholl, M., and Voisard, A. 2002. Spatial Databases - with application to GIS. Morgan Kaufmann, San Francisco, 410pp.</ref> and/or searched by simple alphanumeric text searches. C-squares is an example of such a grid where the cell identifiers are designed to be human- as well as machine-readable, and to be concordant with recognizable and commonly intervals of latitude and longitude.\n\n===Dataset footprints===\n[[Geographic data and information|Spatial data]], that is, data associated with particular geographic locations on the earth, have spatial \"footprints\" that ideally are recorded in metadata systems or data catalogues, to support spatial searching of the resources in question.<ref name = \"Hill_2006\">Hill, Linda (2006). ''Georeferencing: The Geographic Associations of Information''. MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. and London, England, 260 pp. {{ISBN|978-0-262-08354-6}}</ref> A \"basic\" generalization of any data footprint is the minimum bounding rectangle or MBR, that is, the smallest set of boundaries of latitude and longitude that completely contain the data. Such stored rectangles are relatively simple to query as a mathematical operation (look for overlap with an input \"search\" rectangle) but, with real world data, may not be a good surrogate for the true data \"footprint\" if the latter contains disjoint or sparsely populated data items, items on a diagonal line, or items with significant \"holes\", such as a vessel track around a continent.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /> Representation as a set of smaller \"tiles\", such those denoted by c-square codes at an appropriate resolution, can more accurately reflect the shape of such non-rectangular and/or non-contiguous datasets.<ref name = \"Rees_2003\" /><ref name = \"Hill_2006\" />\n\n===Data binning===\n{{Main|Data binning}}\n\"Binning\" describes the process of converting continuously variable data (in the present case, spatial locations in degrees of latitude and longitude) into a set of discrete \"bins\" in order to apply the indexing and subsequent search/retrieval processes, other processing and reporting, etc. The optimal size of the spatial data \"bins\" can depend on the user's requirements (e.g. geographic coverage), desire for handling large vs. small datasets (which can affect the time required for processing or production of on-demand maps) and density of available data (with sparse input data, many \"bins\" may end up being empty). Large \"bins\" will have smaller data handling requirements and smooth out data deficiencies, but will result in a loss of resolution of fine scale data; small \"bins\" can result in large quantities of data to be handled (for example, a global coverage at 0.1 degree resolution requires over 6 million grid cells) which may be too much for easy handling. To date, 0.5 degree cells (50\u00d750 km nominal size) have been found to be a reasonable compromise between resolution and data storage requirements for global coverages (259,200 cells), e.g. as used for Aquamaps,<ref name = \"Ready_et_al_2010\" /> while for more local applications, either 0.5 or 0.1 degree cells may be useful.\n\n===Data reduction===\n{{Main|data reduction}}\nOne advantage of binning spatial data as described above is that it offers the potential for [[data reduction]] in some use cases: for example rather than storing (say) hundreds of raw data points within the same bin, the data can be represented as an average value and/or number of data points held, or just as presence/absence (for example as a range map). By this means, the quantity of information required to be stored in the spatial index and associated information can be substantially reduced in many cases, with a concomitant improvement in performance (speed of spatial queries and resulting mapping as desired).\n\n===Hierarchical representation===\n{{Main|Discrete global grid#Hierarchical grids}}\nAs a property of a discrete global grid, hierarchical notation ensures that the geocodes for finer resolutions of the mesh incorporate those of all their parents, permitting rapid search and/or data aggregation at any desired equal or higher level of the hierarchy. In the c-squares case, the code is extended by additional alphanumeric characters as the spatial resolution increases, with the corollary that resolution can be decreased if desired, merely by truncating the code by the relevant amount.\n\n[[File:Sphere wireframe.svg|thumb|An equal angle spherical (global) grid, represented in a \"real world\" (orthographic) perspective.]]\n===Equal angle grids===\nEqual angle grids (the class that includes c-squares) have the advantage that transformation of spatial data (for example as simple coordinates of latitude and longitude) in and out of the grid notation can be simple, since the latitude\u2013longitude grid is itself equal angle.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/85ec/ec57454e66e3326b4aaf834ab9c5fe4e073c.pdf |last1=Kimerling |first1=A. Jon |last2=Sahr |first2=Kevin |last3=White |first3=Denis |last4=Song |first4=Lian |year=1999 |title=Comparing geometrical properties of global grids |journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=271\u2013288 |doi=}}</ref> On the actual surface of the globe, the cells are approximately \"square\" only adjacent to the equator, and become progressively narrower and tapered (also with curved northern and southern boundaries) as they approach the poles, and cells adjoining the poles are unique in possessing three faces rather than four. By contrast, equal area grids attempt to preserve a constant area for all cells at the same hierarchical level (resolution), at the expense of losing concordance with familiar lines of latitude and/or longitude.\n\n===Regional (local/national) vs. global grids===\nLocal and/or national grids have been developed for use within a number of countries, for example the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|UK National Grid]] has been in use since 1946,<ref name = \"Nature_1946\">{{Cite journal |url=https://tos.org/oceanography/article/c-squares-a-new-spatial-indexing-system-and-its-applicability-to-the-descri |last=Anonymous |first=|year=1946 |title=The National Grid of the Ordnance Survey |journal=Nature |volume=158 |issue= |pages=510 |doi=10.1038/158510a0}}</ref> while a separate system is in use for [[Irish grid reference system|Ireland]]. Discontinuities occur where such grids meet or overlap, and some areas (for example the more offshore portions of surrounding seas and the [[Channel Islands]]) are not covered at all. Global grids offer a solution to this problem (providing standard treatment for all areas of the globe) and also offer a potential format for collation of cross-national data into a single repository for analysis and reporting, for example see Vanhee ''et al''., 2018.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" />\n\n==The c-squares global grid notation==\n[[File:WMO-squares-global.gif|thumb|Global coverage of 10x10 degree World Meteorological Organization (WMO) squares (= c-squares 10-degree grid)]]\n\n===Initial 10 degree squares===\n10-degree c-squares are specified as being identical to equivalent World Meteteorological Organization (WMO) square codes, refer illustration at right. These squares are aligned with 10-degree subdivisions of the global latitude\u2013longitude grid, which for c-squares use is specified as employing the [[World Geodetic System#WGS84|WGS84 datum]]. WMO (10 degree) squares are encoded with four digits, in the series 1xxx, 3xxx, 5xxx and 7xxx.<ref name=\"NODC_1998\" /> The leading digit indicates the \"global quadrant\" with 1 for north-east (latitude and longitude are both positive), 3 for south-east (latitude is negative and longitude positive), 5 for south-west (latitude and longitude are both negative) and 7 for north-west (latitude is positive and longitude negative). The next digit, 0 through 8, corresponds to the tens of latitude degrees either north or south; while the remaining 2 digits, 00 through 17, correspond to the tens of longitude degrees either east or west (by specification, 0 is treated as positive). Thus the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 0,0 (latitude,longitude) is encoded 1000, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 0 and 10 degrees north (actually, 0 and 9.999...) and 0 and 9.999... degrees east; the 10 degree cell with its lower left corner at 80 N, 170 E is encoded 1817, and acts as a bin to contain all spatial data between 80 and 90 degrees north and 170 and 179.999... degrees east.\n\n===Subsequent recursive subdivision===\nC-squares extends the initial WMO 10\u00d710 square notation via a recursive series of \"cycles\", each 3 digits long (the final one may be 1 digit), separated by the colon character, the number of characters (and cycles) indicating the resolution encoded, as per these examples:\n*1000 ... 10\u00d710 degree square (up to 1000\u00d71000 km nominal)\n*1000:1 ... 5\u00d75 degree square (up to 500\u00d7500 km nominal)\n*1000:100 ... 1\u00d71 degree square (up to 100\u00d7100 km nominal)\n*1000:100:1 ... 0.5\u00d70.5 degree square (up to 50\u00d750km nominal)\n*1000:100:100 ... 0.1\u00d70.1 degree square (up to 10\u00d710 km nominal)\n*1000:100:100:1 ... 0.05\u00d70.05 degree square (up to 5\u00d75km nominal)\n(etc.)\n\nThe nominal sizes given reflect the fact that at the equator, 1 degree of both latitude and longitude correspond to around 110 km, with the actual value for longitude declining between there and the poles, where it becomes zero (latitude actual: 110.567 km at the equator, 111.699 km at the poles; longitude actual: 111.320 km at the equator, 78.847 km at latitude \u00b145 degrees, 0 km at the poles); at a sample northern hemisphere latitude e.g. that of [[London]] (51.5 degrees north), a 1\u00d71 degree square measures approximately 111\u00d769 km.<ref>U.S. National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center: [https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/gccalc.shtml Latitude/Longitude Distance Calculator]</ref>\n\n[[File:C-squares geocode principle - SE intermediate quadrant example.gif|thumb|C-squares recursive subdivision principle - intermediate quadrant example (south-east global quadrant)]]\nTo produce the 1 or 3 digits in any cycle following the initial 4-digit, 10-degree square identifier, first an \"intermediate quadrant\", 1 through 4 is designated (refer diagram at right), where 1 indicates low absolute values of both latitude and longitude (regardless of sign), 2 indicates low longitude and high latitude, 3 indicates high latitude and low longitude, and 4 indicates high values for both; \"low\" and high\" being taken from the relevant portion of the data to be gridded (for example within the 10 degree cell extending from 10 to 20 degrees, 10 is treated as low and 19 as high). This leading digit in a cycle is then followed simply by the next applicable digit for first latitude and then longitude: thus an input value of latitude +11.0, longitude +12.0 degrees will be encoded as the 5 degree c-square code 1101:1 and the 1 degree code 1101:112. Inspection of this code will show that the input latitude value can be recovered directly from the digits 1<u>1</u>01:1<u>1</u>2 while the longitude is included as 11<u>01</u>:11<u>2</u>; the sign for these is both positive, as indicated by the first digit of the leading 4 (1 in this case, indicating the north east global quadrant).\n\nFrom 2002 onwards (still current at 2020), an online \"[http://www.marine.csiro.au/marq/csq_builder.init latlong to c-squares conversion page]\" is available at the website of CSIRO Marine Research (now CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere) which will convert input values of latitude and longitude to the equivalent c-square code at user selectable resolutions from 10 to 0.1 degree cell size. Alternatively it is a comparatively simple task to program from first principles (or construct as, for example, a [[Microsoft Excel]] worksheet) according to the c-squares specification;<ref name=\"c-squares_spec\">[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/spec1-1.htm C-squares Specification - Version 1.1 (December 2005)]</ref> an example is available [http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/c-squares-encoder.xls here].\n\n==C-squares strings, and the c-squares mapper==\nA set of c-squares (contiguous or non contiguous) can be represented as a concatenated list of individual square codes, separated by the \"pipe\" (|) character, thus: 7500:110:3|7500:110:1|1500:110:3|1500:110:1 (etc.). This set of squares can then serve as an indication of a dataset extent, similar in function (but simpler to specify) to a MultiPolygon in the [[Well-known text representation of geometry]], the functional difference being that defined points forming the boundary of a polygon can be continuously variable, while those for the c-square boundaries are constrained to fixed intervals from the grid square resolution in use. If these strings are stored, for example as \"long text\" within a field of a conventional text storage system (e.g. spreadsheet, database, etc.) they can be used for the operation of spatial searches (see following section/s).\n\nC-squares strings can also be used directly as input to an instance of the \"c-squares mapper\", a web-based utility in operation since 2002 at CSIRO in Australia (under the domain obis.org.au) and also at other global locations. To visualize the position of any set of squares on a map, the current syntax to address an installation of the \"c-squares mapper\" is (e.g.):\n\n[http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2|3112:370:2|3112:360:4|3111:360:3|3110:469:3|3112:360:3|3111:469:2|3111:469:1|3110:469:1|3111:458:4|3111:458:3|3110:458:2|3111:457:2|3111:247:3|3110:248:3|3111:246:2|3110:247:2|3111:235:4|3111:134:1|3110:237:1|3112:235:2|3112:225:3|3111:122:4|3110:227:3|3112:124:4|3111:121:2|3112:124:1|3112:122:2|3112:123:1|3110:216:4|3112:112:3|3111:110:3|3110:217:1|3110:216:2|3110:205:3|3110:205:1|3110:206:2|3110:205:2|3010:496:4|3010:496:2 http://www.obis.org.au/cgi-bin/cs_map.pl?csq=3211:123:2|3211:113:4|3211:114:1|3211:206:2|3211:206:1|3111:496:3|3111:495:4|3111:495:1|3111:394:2|3111:495:2|3111:384:3|3111:383:1|3111:382:2|3111:372:3|3111:371:4|3112:371:1|3111:370:2| (etc.)].\n\n[[Image:Aquamap-mola-mola-20091106-med-res.png|right|240px|thumb|[[AquaMaps|AquaMap]] for ''Mola mola'', the ocean sunfish, generated via the c-squares mapper at 0.5 degree square resolution]]\nIt should be noted here that the above call to the c-squares mapper is a simple one, with only a single parameter (a single c-squares string) which produces a simple \"default map\"; the mapper is in fact quite highly customizable, capable of accepting up to seven c-squares strings concurrently, plotting them in user-specified colours, with a choice of empty of filled squares, user-selectable base map, etc. etc.; a full list of available input parameters is provided on the mapper \"technical information\" page.<ref>[http://www.cmar.csiro.au/csquares/mapper-tech.htm CMAR c-squares Mapper - Technical Information] page</ref> A more sophisticated map produced using a larger number of available parameters is the colour-coded example at right ([[AquaMaps|AquaMap]], i.e. modelled distribution, for the ocean sunfish).\n\n==Spatial searching==\nIn a system that uses c-squares codes as units of spatial indexing, a text-based search on any of these square identifiers will retrieve data associated with the relevant square. If a wildcard search is supported (for example in the case that the wildcard character is a percent sign), a search on \"7500%\" will retrieve all data items in that ten degree square, a search on \"7500:1%\" will retrieve all data items in that five degree square, etc.\n\nThe asterisk character \"*\" has a special (reserved) meaning in c-squares notation, being a \"compact\" notation indicating that all finer cells within a higher level cell are included, to the level of resolution indicated by the number of asterisks. In the example above, \"7500:*\" would indicate that all 4 five-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, \"7500:***\" would indicate that all 100 one-degree cells within parent ten-degree cell \"7500\" are filled, etc. This approach enables the filling of contiguous blocks of cells with an economy of characters in many cases (a form of [[data compression]]), that is useful for efficient storage and transfer of c-squares codes as required.\n\n==Spatial data exchange and assembly==\nExamples of the use of c-squares for multi-national data reporting and assembly include the use of 0.05 \u00d7 0.05 degree c-squares for VMS (vessel monitoring systems) data and fishing logbook data for [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]], the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea,<ref name = \"ICES_2019\" >International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (2019) ICES Technical Guidelines: 16.3.3.3 Spatial distribution of fishing effort and physical disturbance of benthic habitats by mobile bottom trawl fishing gear using VMS. doi: 10.17895/ices.advice.4683 1 Available at https://www.ices.dk/sites/pub/Publication%20Reports/Guidelines%20and%20Policies/16.03.03.03_Guidelines_Vessel_Monitoring_Systems_Data.pdf</ref> and the reporting and collation of fishing activity by member states into 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 degree c-squares by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) of the European Commission.<ref name=\"Vanhee_et_al_2018\" /><ref name = \"Holmes_et_al_2018\">Holmes, S.J., Gibin, M., Scott, F., Zanzi, A., ''et al.''

[[AllMusic]]'s David Jeffries gave praise to the album's three singles and \"Give Me a Call\" but felt the rest of the track listing contained \"redundant cuts and overdone party numbers\" with Jones' overused gimmicky catchphrases. He called the record a \"significant step up\" from ''[[The American Dream (Mike Jones album)|The American Dream]]'' EP.<ref name=\"AM\"/> Nathan Slavik of DJBooth highlighted both \"Next to You\" and \"Cuddy Buddy\" as potential radio chart-toppers but found the album going into \"unlistenable territory\" with tracks ranging from a \"half-baked\" dance craze (\"Drop & Gimmie 50\"), butchering of a celebratory anthem (\"Happy Birthday\") and full-on misogyny (\"Scandalous Hoes II\"). Slavik concluded by giving his take on Jones' next project: \"Sadly expectations will be low after ''The Voice'', here's hoping he truly delivers something unexpected.\"<ref name=\"DJB\"/> Conversely, Steve 'Flash' Juon from ''RapReviews'' praised Jones for delivering a decently paced album that has catchy beats to invigorate the collaborative tracks while also showcasing both his lyrical and vocal improvements from the past four years, concluding with \"Regardless of the reasons it's clear that Mike Jones is a more seasoned and polished pro of the rap game, and ''The Voice'' is planning to have a long career in hip-hop music.
