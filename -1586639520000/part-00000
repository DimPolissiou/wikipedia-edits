The Malibu began as a trim-level of the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]], becoming its own model line in 1978. Originally a [[Rear wheel drive#Rear wheel drive layouts|rear-wheel-drive]] intermediate, [[General Motors|GM]] revived the Malibu nameplate as a [[front-wheel-drive]] car in 1997.\n\nNamed after coastal community of [[Malibu, California]], the Malibu was marketed primarily in North America, with the eighth generation introduced globally.\nWith the discontinuation of the Chevrolet Impala in March 2020, the Malibu and the Sonic currently are the only sedans offered in the Chevrolet division in the U.S.A.\n==First generation (1964\u20131967)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = File:Chevrolet Malibu SS 283 2.jpg\n| caption = 1965 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu SS convertible\n| name = First generation\n| model_years = 1964\u20131967\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] <br /> 2-door [[hardtop]] <br /> 2-door [[convertible]] <br /> [[Station wagon]]\n| related = [[Chevrolet Chevelle]]<br />[[Chevrolet El Camino]]<br />[[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]<br />[[Oldsmobile Cutlass]]<br />[[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]]<br />[[Pontiac Grand Prix]]<br />[[Pontiac LeMans]]\n}}\n{{Main|Chevrolet Chevelle#First generation (1964-1967)}}\n\nThe first Malibu was a top-line subseries of the mid-sized [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] from 1964 to 1972. Malibus were generally available in a full range of bodystyles including a four-door sedan, two-door Sport Coupe hardtop, convertible and two-seat station wagon. Interiors were more lavish than lesser Chevelle 300 and 300 Deluxe models thanks to patterned cloth and vinyl upholstery (all-vinyl in convertibles and station wagons), deep-twist carpeting, deluxe steering wheel and other items. The Malibu [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|SS]] was available only as a two-door Sport Coupe hardtop or convertible and added bucket seats, center console (with optional four-speed manual or Powerglide transmissions), engine gauges and special wheelcovers, and offered with any six-cylinder or V8 engine offered in other Chevelles - with the top option being a {{convert|300|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} in 1964.\n\nFor 1965, Malibus and other Chevelles received new grilles and revised tail sections and had the exhaust pipes replaced but carried over the same basic styling and bodystyles from 1964. The Malibu and Malibu SS models continued as before with the SS featuring a blacked-out grille and special wheelcovers. Top engine option was now a {{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8.\n[[File:1967 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 396 Sports Coupe (15452516841).jpg|thumb|A red 1967 Chevrolet Malibu]]\nThe Malibu SS was replaced in 1966 by a new Chevelle SS-396 series that included a big-block {{convert|396|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine (Canadian market did not receive the SS396 but marketed the former Malibu SS nameplate until January 1967 when it was phased out), heavy duty suspension and other performance equipment. Other SS-396 equipment was similar to Malibu Sport Coupes and convertibles including an all-vinyl bench seat. Bucket seats and console with floor shift were now optional on the SS and for 1966 with the SS now denoting a car with a big-block engine, the bucket seats became a new option on the regular Malibu Sport Coupe and convertible, upon which any six-cylinder or small-block V8 could be ordered. Also new for 1966 was the Chevelle Malibu four-door Sport Sedan hardtop. Styling revisions on all 1966 Chevelles including more rounded styling similar to the full-sized Chevrolets with sail panels and tunneled rear windows featured on two-door hardtop coupes.\n\nFor 1967, the same assortment of bodystyles were continued with styling changes similar to all other Chevelles including a new grille and revised tail section with taillights that wrapped around to the side. New this year was a Chevelle Malibu Concours station wagon with [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] exterior side panel trim. Front disc brakes were a new option along with a stereo [[8-track tape]] player. The same assortment of drivetrains carried over from 1966 with the top {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 dropped from {{convert|350|to|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Second generation (1968\u20131972)==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}\n{{Main|Chevrolet Chevelle#Second generation (1968-1972)}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name        = Second generation\n| image       = Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Coupe.jpg\n| caption     = 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Sport Coupe\n| aka         = [[Chevrolet Chevelle]]\n| model_years = 1968\u20131972\n| assembly    = \n| body_style  = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[convertible]]\n| layout      = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| platform    = [[GM A platform (RWD)|A platform]] (RWD)\n| related     = [[Buick Century]]<br />[[Buick Regal]]<br />[[Chevrolet El Camino]]<br />[[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]<br />[[Oldsmobile Cutlass]]<br />[[Oldsmobile Cutlass 442]]<br />[[Pontiac Grand Am]]<br />[[Pontiac Grand Prix]]<br />[[Pontiac LeMans]]\n}}\n\nMalibus and all other Chevelles were completely restyled for 1968 with semi-fastback rooflines on two-door hardtops and wheelbases split to {{convert|112|in|mm}}} on two-door models and 116 for four-door sedans and station wagons. Engine offerings included a new {{convert|307|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 rated at {{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} that replaced the {{convert|283|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 that had served as the base V8 since the Chevelle's introduction in 1964. Inside was a new instrument panel featuring round gauges in square pods similar to what would appear in Camaros the following year. New for 1968 was the Concours luxury option for Malibu sedans and coupes that included upgraded cloth or vinyl bench seats, carpeted lower door panels, woodgrain trim on dash and door panels, a center console and floor shifter (only with the hardtop and convertible, which was shared with the SS396) and Concours nameplates. There was again a top-line Concours Estate wagon with simulated woodgrain trim that had the same interior and exterior appointments as the Malibu sedans.\n[[File:Chevrolet Malibu 2-door mid 1970s model.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Chevelle Malibu 2-door sport coupe]]\nNew grilles and rear decks with revised taillights highlighted the 1969 Malibus and other Chevelles. Instrument panels were revised and front seat headrests were now standard equipment due to federal safety mandate. The ignition switch moved from the instrument panel to the steering column and also doubled as a steering wheel lock. The 307 continued as the base V8, but the 327 engines were replaced by new {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s of {{convert|255|and|300|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. GM's three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, previously only offered on SS-396 Chevelles (RPO M40), was now available on all models with all engines (THM400s were used with the 396 while the THM350 (RPO M38) first introduced with the Camaro and Nova) was phased in with the small blocks optioned, including the six-cylinder and small-block V8s which in previous years were only available with the two-speed Powerglide. A police package Chevelle 300 (pillared 4 door sedan) was available for the 1969 model year which came with the L35 code 396 - it was built in few numbers when the Chrysler Corporation held the market for its law enforcement orders. Some 1964 and 1965 Chevelle 300s came with the BO7 police package but was powered with the inline six.\n\nFor 1970, the Malibu was initially the only series of Chevelle offered, aside from the SS-396 and new SS-454, as the low-line 300 and 300 Deluxe models were discontinued for the American market (it continued in Canada until 1972), which also eliminated the two-door pillared coupes from the Chevelle lineup \u2013 which were never included in the Malibu series. New grilles, rear decks with taillights moved into the bumper and revised Sport Coupe roofline highlighted this year's changes. The standard six-cylinder engine was punched up from {{convert|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|155|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, while the same assortment of V8s carried over with the addition of a {{convert|330|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 on non-SS Chevelles. At mid-year, the Malibu was rejoined by lower-line Chevelle models that were simply called the base Chevelle in both four-door sedans and two-door hardtops.\n\nIn 1971, Malibus and all other Chevelles got a new grille surrounded by single headlamps replacing the duals of previous years, and four round taillights similar to Camaros and Corvettes were located in the bumper. All engines were detuned to use lower-octane unleaded gasoline this year per GM corporate policy as a first step toward the catalytic converter-equipped cars planned for 1975 and later models which would require no-lead fuel.\n\nOnly new grilles highlighted the 1972 Malibu and other Chevelles. All bodystyles were carried over from 1971, but 1972 would be the final year for hardtops and convertibles as the redesigned Chevelles originally planned for this year, but delayed until 1973, would feature Colonnade styling with side pillars and frameless door windows. The 1972 Chevelle was also ordered with the police package which used RPO 9C1 (which became the default SEO (service option) code for subsequent [[9C1 (Chevrolet Police package)|Chevrolet PPV package]]s).\n{{clear}}\n\n==Third generation (1973\u20131977)==\n{{Main|Chevrolet_Chevelle#Third_generation_(1973\u20131977)}}\n[[File:1977 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Classic Landau Coup\u00e9, front left.jpg|thumb|1977 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Classic Landau Coupe]]\n\nThe Chevelle was redesigned for the 1973 model year. Models included the base '''Deluxe''', mid-range '''Malibu''' & '''Malibu SS''' and the top-line '''Laguna'''.\n\nFor 1974, the Deluxe was dropped, and the Malibu became the entry-level Chevelle. The Laguna trim package was replaced with the Malibu Classic which used a stacked arrangement of four rectangular headlights and made its way to the dealers in the 1976 model year, offering the Chevrolet built inline six 250 CID as the base engine. The Laguna S-3 model was introduced to replace the [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|SS]], and continued through 1976.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Fourth generation (1978\u20131983)==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2010}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Fourth generation\n| image = File:Chevy80.jpg\n| caption = Malibu Classic Landau \n| production = 1978\u20131983\n| assembly = [[Arlington, Texas]], U.S.<br> [[Lakewood Heights, Atlanta|Lakewood Heights]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], U.S.<br>[[Oshawa, Ontario|Oshawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada<br />[[Ramos Arizpe]], [[Mexico]]<br />[[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]], [[Venezuela]]\n| successor = [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br />5-door [[station wagon]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| platform = [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]] (1978\u20131983)\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list | 3/4-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] }}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|108|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|192.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan & coupe)<br /> {{convert|193.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)\n| width = {{convert|71.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan & coupe)<br /> {{convert|71.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)\n| height = {{convert|53.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br /> {{convert|54.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)<br /> {{convert|193.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (coupe)\n| related = {{unbulleted list | [[Buick Century]] | [[Buick Regal]] | [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] | [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]] | [[Pontiac LeMans#Fifth generation (1978-1981)|Pontiac LeMans]] | [[Pontiac Bonneville#1982\u20131986|Pontiac Bonneville]] }}\n}}\n\nFor the 1978 model year, the Malibu name, which had been the bestselling badge in the lineup, replaced the [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]] name. This was Chevrolet's second [[downsize (automobile)|downsized]] nameplate, following the lead of the 1977 [[Chevrolet Caprice]]. The new, more efficient platform was over a foot shorter and had shed {{convert|500|to|1000|lb|}} compared to previous versions, yet offered increased trunk space, leg room, and head room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-malibu15.htm|title=How Stuff Works 1978 Chevrolet Malibu|publisher=How Stuff Works}}</ref> Only two trim levels were offered - Malibu and Malibu Classic. The Malibu Classic Landau series had a two-tone paint job on the upper and lower body sections, and a vinyl top. This generation introduced the [[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine|Chevrolet 90\u00b0 V6]] family of engines, with the 200 CID (3.3&nbsp;L) V6 as the base engine for the all new 1978 Chevrolet Malibu, along with the 229 CID (3.8&nbsp;L) V6 and the 305 CID (5.0&nbsp;L) Chevy built V8 as options.  The 200 and 229 engines were essentially a small block V-8, with one pair of cylinders lopped off.  The front and rear bellhousing face were the same as the small V8.  The 231 engine was a Buick product, and featured a front distributor.\n\nThree bodystyles were produced ([[station wagon]], [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]], and [[coupe]]), and the design was also used as the basis for the [[Chevrolet El Camino#Fifth generation|El Camino]] pickup truck with its own chassis. The sedan initially had a conservative six-window [[notchback]] roofline. This was in contrast to the unusual fastback rooflines adopted by Oldsmobile and Buick divisions which would later revert a more formal pillar style. To increase rear seat hip room (and encourage more orders for the high-profit air conditioner), the windows in the rear doors of four-door sedans were fixed, while the wagons had small moveable vents. With the rear window regulators no longer required, Chevrolet was able to recess the door arm rests into the door cavity, resulting in a few extra inches of rear seat room. Customers complained about the lack of rear seat ventilation. No doubt this design contributed to the number of factory air conditioning units sold with the cars, to the benefit of General Motors and Chevrolet dealers. For the 1981 model year, sedans adopted a four-window profile and \"formal\" pillared upright roofline. The two-door coupe was last produced in this year, as the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#Fourth generation|Monte Carlo]] assumed the market position held by the 2-door coupe. For 1982 the Malibu was facelifted with more squared-off front styling marked by quad headlights with long, thin turn signals beneath them. The look was very reminiscent of the also recently facelifted Chevrolet Caprice. For 1983, Malibus gained a block-style \"Malibu\" badge on the front fenders to replace the cursive-style script located on the rear quarter panels of previous model years.\n\nThe four-door Malibu was commonly used in fleet service, especially for law enforcement. After the [[Chevrolet Nova]] ceased production in 1979, the [[mid-size car|mid-sized]] '''9C1''' [[police car|police version]] (not to be confused with the full-size [[Chevrolet Impala]] '''9C1''' which was also available) was transferred to the Malibu, filling a void for the [[mid-size car|mid-sized]] [[police car|police patrol car]]s. A 9C1-equipped Malibu with an LT-1 Z-28 Camaro engine driven by [[E. Pierce Marshall]] placed 13th of 47 in the 1979 [[Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash]], better known as the Cannonball Run.<ref>[[Brock Yates|Yates, Brock]] (2002) \"Cannonball!: World's Greatest Outlaw Road Race\" MBI Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-7603-1090-4}}</ref>\n\nThere was no factory Malibu SS option available on this generation. The SS only came in the [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]].\nThe rare, and striking, 1980 Malibu M80 was a dealer package for only North and South Carolina. It was mostly aimed at NASCAR fans who regularly traveled to Darlington Raceway. To this day, the number actually produced is unknown; estimates place this around 1,901 cars. All M80s had to be white with dark blue bucket seats and center console interior. The base of the M80 was a two-door sport coupe equipped with the F41 Sport Suspension package and the normal V8 (140&nbsp;hp) drive train. The M80 option added two dark blue skunk stripes on top and a lower door stripe with the M80 identification. The package also added front and rear spoilers and 1981 steel rally wheels (sourced from the 1980 Monte Carlo).\n\nIn Mexico, General Motors produced this generation in the [[Ramos Arizpe Assembly|Ramos Arizpe plant]], which was sold during three years (1979 to 1981). Mexican versions came in three trim levels (Chevelle, Malibu and Malibu Classic) and two body styles (sedan and coupe) with the {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 as basic engine and the {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 as the optional; this engine was standard on Malibu Classic models during those three years. This was possible because the Mexican emissions regulations remained relatively free at the time.\n\n===Iraqi taxi===\nIn 1981, [[General Motors Canada|General Motors of Canada]] in [[Oshawa]] produced a special order of 25,500 four-door Malibu sedans for [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]i government. The deal was reportedly worth well over $100 million to GMCL. These special-order Malibus carried the unusual combination of GM's lowest-power carburated V6, the {{convert|110|hp|abbr=on}} {{convert|229|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine mated to three-speed manual transmission with a unique on-the-floor stick shifter. All of the cars were equipped with air conditioning, heavy duty cooling systems, AM/FM cassette decks, front bench seats, 200&nbsp;km/h speedometers, tough tweed and vinyl upholstery and {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} body-color stamped steel wheels with small \"dog dish\" hubcaps.\n\nHowever, only 13,000 units ever made it to Iraq, with the majority of the cars becoming taxis in [[Baghdad]] (once the cab-identifying orange paint was added to the front and rear fenders){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. With the remaining balance of about 12,500 additional Malibus either sitting on a dock in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] or awaiting port shipment in [[Oshawa]], where they were built, the Iraqis suddenly cancelled the order in 1982.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Reuters |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E3D71439F933A05750C0A964948260 |title=G.M.

This issue was eventually identified as being due to an apparent clutch release issue that eventually required on-site retrofitting by a crew of Canadian technicians sent to Iraq to support the infamous \"Recall in the Desert\". Later speculation was that the Iraqis were actually forced to back out for financial reasons, due to their escalating hostilities with [[Iran]] requiring the immediate diversion of funds to support the Iraqi war effort. Then GM of Canada President Donald Hackworth was initially quoted as stating GMCL intended to still try to sell the Malibus overseas in other Middle East markets; however in the end, the orphaned \"Iraqi Taxi\" Malibus were all sold to the Canadian public at the greatly reduced price of about [[Canadian dollar|C$]]6,800. Over the years, they have acquired a low-key 'celebrity' status, sometimes being colloquially referred to as \"Iraqibu\".<ref>http://www.curbsideclassic.com/blog/automotive-history-snapshot-1981-chevrolet-malibu-iraqi-taxi/</ref><ref>https://jalopnik.com/this-chevy-malibu-tells-a-far-out-story-from-a-far-away-856827455</ref>\n\n===NASCAR===\nThe Malibu was an extensively used body style in [[NASCAR]] competition from 1973 to 1983. The Laguna S-3 variant, in particular, was successful during the 1975 through 1977 racing seasons, with [[Cale Yarborough]] winning 20 races in those years as well as winning the NASCAR championship one year. Because it was considered a limited edition model, NASCAR declared it ineligible for competition following the 1977 season, even though (given NASCARs three-year eligibility rule) it should have been allowed to run through 1979. Beginning in 1981, the downsized Malibu body style was eligible to run, but given its boxy shape, only one driver [[Dave Marcis]] ran it in 1981 and 1982, with one victory in a rain-shortened [[Capital City 400|Richmond 400]] at [[Richmond International Raceway|Richmond]] in 1982, the independent driver's last win.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:'79 Chevrolet Malibu Sedan (Orange Julep).JPG |1979 Chevrolet Malibu sedan\nFile:Chevrolet Malibu Coupe (Orange Julep).jpg|Chevrolet Malibu coupe\nFile:Chevrolet Malibu Landau BW 2016-09-03 14-13-26.jpg|1978 Chevrolet Malibu coupe\nFile:1982 Chevrolet Malibu Station Wagon (11265825623).jpg|1982 Chevrolet Malibu wagon\nFile:Chevrolet_Malibu_classic.jpg|Chevrolet Malibu Classic made and sold in Mexico\n</gallery>\n\n===Engines===\nThe base {{convert|200|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V-6 engine for the 1978 Chevrolet Malibu developed just {{convert|95|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} with optional upgrade to a {{convert|105|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} V-6, or {{convert|145|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} V-8.

The Malibu began as a trim-level of the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]], becoming its own model line in 1978. Originally a [[Rear wheel drive#Rear wheel drive layouts|rear-wheel-drive]] intermediate, [[General Motors|GM]] revived the Malibu nameplate as a [[front-wheel-drive]] car in 1997.\n\nNamed after coastal community of [[Malibu, California]], the Malibu was marketed primarily in North America, with the eighth generation introduced globally.\nWith the discontinuation of the Chevrolet Impala in March 2020, the Malibu and the Sonic currently are the only sedans offered in the Chevrolet division in the U.S.A.\n==First generation (1964\u20131967)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = File:Chevrolet Malibu SS 283 2.jpg\n| caption = 1965 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu SS convertible\n| name = First generation\n| model_years = 1964\u20131967\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] <br /> 2-door [[hardtop]] <br /> 2-door [[convertible]] <br /> [[Station wagon]]\n| related = [[Chevrolet Chevelle]]<br />[[Chevrolet El Camino]]<br />[[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]<br />[[Oldsmobile Cutlass]]<br />[[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]]<br />[[Pontiac Grand Prix]]<br />[[Pontiac LeMans]]\n}}\n{{Main|Chevrolet Chevelle#First generation (1964-1967)}}\n\nThe first Malibu was a top-line subseries of the mid-sized [[Chevrolet Chevelle]] from 1964 to 1972. Malibus were generally available in a full range of bodystyles including a four-door sedan, two-door Sport Coupe hardtop, convertible and two-seat station wagon. Interiors were more lavish than lesser Chevelle 300 and 300 Deluxe models thanks to patterned cloth and vinyl upholstery (all-vinyl in convertibles and station wagons), deep-twist carpeting, deluxe steering wheel and other items. The Malibu [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|SS]] was available only as a two-door Sport Coupe hardtop or convertible and added bucket seats, center console (with optional four-speed manual or Powerglide transmissions), engine gauges and special wheelcovers, and offered with any six-cylinder or V8 engine offered in other Chevelles - with the top option being a {{convert|300|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} in 1964.\n\nFor 1965, Malibus and other Chevelles received new grilles and revised tail sections and had the exhaust pipes replaced but carried over the same basic styling and bodystyles from 1964. The Malibu and Malibu SS models continued as before with the SS featuring a blacked-out grille and special wheelcovers. Top engine option was now a {{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8.\n[[File:1967 Chevrolet Chevelle SS 396 Sports Coupe (15452516841).jpg|thumb|A red 1967 Chevrolet Malibu]]\nThe Malibu SS was replaced in 1966 by a new Chevelle SS-396 series that included a big-block {{convert|396|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine (Canadian market did not receive the SS396 but marketed the former Malibu SS nameplate until January 1967 when it was phased out), heavy duty suspension and other performance equipment. Other SS-396 equipment was similar to Malibu Sport Coupes and convertibles including an all-vinyl bench seat. Bucket seats and console with floor shift were now optional on the SS and for 1966 with the SS now denoting a car with a big-block engine, the bucket seats became a new option on the regular Malibu Sport Coupe and convertible, upon which any six-cylinder or small-block V8 could be ordered. Also new for 1966 was the Chevelle Malibu four-door Sport Sedan hardtop. Styling revisions on all 1966 Chevelles including more rounded styling similar to the full-sized Chevrolets with sail panels and tunneled rear windows featured on two-door hardtop coupes.\n\nFor 1967, the same assortment of bodystyles were continued with styling changes similar to all other Chevelles including a new grille and revised tail section with taillights that wrapped around to the side. New this year was a Chevelle Malibu Concours station wagon with [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|simulated woodgrain]] exterior side panel trim. Front disc brakes were a new option along with a stereo [[8-track tape]] player. The same assortment of drivetrains carried over from 1966 with the top {{convert|327|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 dropped from {{convert|350|to|325|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Second generation (1968\u20131972)==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}\n{{Main|Chevrolet Chevelle#Second generation (1968-1972)}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name        = Second generation\n| image       = Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Coupe.jpg\n| caption     = 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Sport Coupe\n| aka         = [[Chevrolet Chevelle]]\n| model_years = 1968\u20131972\n| assembly    = \n| body_style  = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[convertible]]\n| layout      = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| platform    = [[GM A platform (RWD)|A platform]] (RWD)\n| related     = [[Buick Century]]<br />[[Buick Regal]]<br />[[Chevrolet El Camino]]<br />[[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]<br />[[Oldsmobile Cutlass]]<br />[[Oldsmobile Cutlass 442]]<br />[[Pontiac Grand Am]]<br />[[Pontiac Grand Prix]]<br />[[Pontiac LeMans]]\n}}\n\nMalibus and all other Chevelles were completely restyled for 1968 with semi-fastback rooflines on two-door hardtops and wheelbases split to {{convert|112|in|mm}}} on two-door models and 116 for four-door sedans and station wagons. Engine offerings included a new {{convert|307|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 rated at {{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} that replaced the {{convert|283|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 that had served as the base V8 since the Chevelle's introduction in 1964. Inside was a new instrument panel featuring round gauges in square pods similar to what would appear in Camaros the following year. New for 1968 was the Concours luxury option for Malibu sedans and coupes that included upgraded cloth or vinyl bench seats, carpeted lower door panels, woodgrain trim on dash and door panels, a center console and floor shifter (only with the hardtop and convertible, which was shared with the SS396) and Concours nameplates. There was again a top-line Concours Estate wagon with simulated woodgrain trim that had the same interior and exterior appointments as the Malibu sedans.\n[[File:Chevrolet Malibu 2-door mid 1970s model.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Chevelle Malibu 2-door sport coupe]]\nNew grilles and rear decks with revised taillights highlighted the 1969 Malibus and other Chevelles. Instrument panels were revised and front seat headrests were now standard equipment due to federal safety mandate. The ignition switch moved from the instrument panel to the steering column and also doubled as a steering wheel lock. The 307 continued as the base V8, but the 327 engines were replaced by new {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s of {{convert|255|and|300|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. GM's three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission, previously only offered on SS-396 Chevelles (RPO M40), was now available on all models with all engines (THM400s were used with the 396 while the THM350 (RPO M38) first introduced with the Camaro and Nova) was phased in with the small blocks optioned, including the six-cylinder and small-block V8s which in previous years were only available with the two-speed Powerglide. A police package Chevelle 300 (pillared 4 door sedan) was available for the 1969 model year which came with the L35 code 396 - it was built in few numbers when the Chrysler Corporation held the market for its law enforcement orders. Some 1964 and 1965 Chevelle 300s came with the BO7 police package but was powered with the inline six.\n\nFor 1970, the Malibu was initially the only series of Chevelle offered, aside from the SS-396 and new SS-454, as the low-line 300 and 300 Deluxe models were discontinued for the American market (it continued in Canada until 1972), which also eliminated the two-door pillared coupes from the Chevelle lineup \u2013 which were never included in the Malibu series. New grilles, rear decks with taillights moved into the bumper and revised Sport Coupe roofline highlighted this year's changes. The standard six-cylinder engine was punched up from {{convert|230|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} to {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|155|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, while the same assortment of V8s carried over with the addition of a {{convert|330|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 on non-SS Chevelles. At mid-year, the Malibu was rejoined by lower-line Chevelle models that were simply called the base Chevelle in both four-door sedans and two-door hardtops.\n\nIn 1971, Malibus and all other Chevelles got a new grille surrounded by single headlamps replacing the duals of previous years, and four round taillights similar to Camaros and Corvettes were located in the bumper. All engines were detuned to use lower-octane unleaded gasoline this year per GM corporate policy as a first step toward the catalytic converter-equipped cars planned for 1975 and later models which would require no-lead fuel.\n\nOnly new grilles highlighted the 1972 Malibu and other Chevelles. All bodystyles were carried over from 1971, but 1972 would be the final year for hardtops and convertibles as the redesigned Chevelles originally planned for this year, but delayed until 1973, would feature Colonnade styling with side pillars and frameless door windows. The 1972 Chevelle was also ordered with the police package which used RPO 9C1 (which became the default SEO (service option) code for subsequent [[9C1 (Chevrolet Police package)|Chevrolet PPV package]]s).\n{{clear}}\n\n==Third generation (1973\u20131977)==\n{{Main|Chevrolet_Chevelle#Third_generation_(1973\u20131977)}}\n[[File:1977 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Classic Landau Coup\u00e9, front left.jpg|thumb|1977 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu Classic Landau Coupe]]\n\nThe Chevelle was redesigned for the 1973 model year. Models included the base '''Deluxe''', mid-range '''Malibu''' & '''Malibu SS''' and the top-line '''Laguna'''.\n\nFor 1974, the Deluxe was dropped, and the Malibu became the entry-level Chevelle. The Laguna trim package was replaced with the Malibu Classic which used a stacked arrangement of four rectangular headlights and made its way to the dealers in the 1976 model year, offering the Chevrolet built inline six 250 CID as the base engine. The Laguna S-3 model was introduced to replace the [[Super Sport (Chevrolet)|SS]], and continued through 1976.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Fourth generation (1978\u20131983)==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2010}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Fourth generation\n| image = File:Chevy80.jpg\n| caption = Malibu Classic Landau \n| production = 1978\u20131983\n| assembly = [[Arlington, Texas]], U.S.<br> [[Lakewood Heights, Atlanta|Lakewood Heights]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], U.S.<br>[[Oshawa, Ontario|Oshawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada<br />[[Ramos Arizpe]], [[Mexico]]<br />[[Valencia, Carabobo|Valencia]], [[Venezuela]]\n| successor = [[Chevrolet Celebrity]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]<br />5-door [[station wagon]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive]]\n| platform = [[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]] (1978\u20131983)\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list | 3/4-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] | 3-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] }}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|108|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|192.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan & coupe)<br /> {{convert|193.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)\n| width = {{convert|71.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan & coupe)<br /> {{convert|71.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)\n| height = {{convert|53.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br /> {{convert|54.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)<br /> {{convert|193.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (coupe)\n| related = {{unbulleted list | [[Buick Century]] | [[Buick Regal]] | [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]] | [[Oldsmobile Cutlass]] | [[Pontiac LeMans#Fifth generation (1978-1981)|Pontiac LeMans]] | [[Pontiac Bonneville#1982\u20131986|Pontiac Bonneville]] }}\n}}\n\nFor the 1978 model year, the Malibu name, which had been the bestselling badge in the lineup, replaced the [[Chevrolet Chevelle|Chevelle]] name. This was Chevrolet's second [[downsize (automobile)|downsized]] nameplate, following the lead of the 1977 [[Chevrolet Caprice]]. The new, more efficient platform was over a foot shorter and had shed {{convert|500|to|1000|lb|}} compared to previous versions, yet offered increased trunk space, leg room, and head room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/chevrolet-malibu15.htm|title=How Stuff Works 1978 Chevrolet Malibu|publisher=How Stuff Works}}</ref> Only two trim levels were offered - Malibu and Malibu Classic. The Malibu Classic Landau series had a two-tone paint job on the upper and lower body sections, and a vinyl top. This generation introduced the [[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine|Chevrolet 90\u00b0 V6]] family of engines, with the 200 CID (3.3&nbsp;L) V6 as the base engine for the all new 1978 Chevrolet Malibu, along with the 229 CID (3.8&nbsp;L) V6 and the 305 CID (5.0&nbsp;L) Chevy built V8 as options.  The 200 and 229 engines were essentially a small block V-8, with one pair of cylinders lopped off.  The front and rear bellhousing face were the same as the small V8.  The 231 engine was a Buick product, and featured a front distributor.\n\nThree bodystyles were produced ([[station wagon]], [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]], and [[coupe]]), and the design was also used as the basis for the [[Chevrolet El Camino#Fifth generation|El Camino]] pickup truck with its own chassis. The sedan initially had a conservative six-window [[notchback]] roofline. This was in contrast to the unusual fastback rooflines adopted by Oldsmobile and Buick divisions which would later revert a more formal pillar style. To increase rear seat hip room (and encourage more orders for the high-profit air conditioner), the windows in the rear doors of four-door sedans were fixed, while the wagons had small moveable vents. With the rear window regulators no longer required, Chevrolet was able to recess the door arm rests into the door cavity, resulting in a few extra inches of rear seat room. Customers complained about the lack of rear seat ventilation. No doubt this design contributed to the number of factory air conditioning units sold with the cars, to the benefit of General Motors and Chevrolet dealers. For the 1981 model year, sedans adopted a four-window profile and \"formal\" pillared upright roofline. The two-door coupe was last produced in this year, as the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#Fourth generation|Monte Carlo]] assumed the market position held by the 2-door coupe. For 1982 the Malibu was facelifted with more squared-off front styling marked by quad headlights with long, thin turn signals beneath them. The look was very reminiscent of the also recently facelifted Chevrolet Caprice. For 1983, Malibus gained a block-style \"Malibu\" badge on the front fenders to replace the cursive-style script located on the rear quarter panels of previous model years.\n\nThe four-door Malibu was commonly used in fleet service, especially for law enforcement. After the [[Chevrolet Nova]] ceased production in 1979, the [[mid-size car|mid-sized]] '''9C1''' [[police car|police version]] (not to be confused with the full-size [[Chevrolet Impala]] '''9C1''' which was also available) was transferred to the Malibu, filling a void for the [[mid-size car|mid-sized]] [[police car|police patrol car]]s. A 9C1-equipped Malibu with an LT-1 Z-28 Camaro engine driven by [[E. Pierce Marshall]] placed 13th of 47 in the 1979 [[Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash]], better known as the Cannonball Run.<ref>[[Brock Yates|Yates, Brock]] (2002) \"Cannonball!: World's Greatest Outlaw Road Race\" MBI Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-7603-1090-4}}</ref>\n\nThere was no factory Malibu SS option available on this generation. The SS only came in the [[Chevrolet El Camino|El Camino]].\nThe rare, and striking, 1980 Malibu M80 was a dealer package for only North and South Carolina. It was mostly aimed at NASCAR fans who regularly traveled to Darlington Raceway. To this day, the number actually produced is unknown; estimates place this around 1,901 cars. All M80s had to be white with dark blue bucket seats and center console interior. The base of the M80 was a two-door sport coupe equipped with the F41 Sport Suspension package and the normal V8 (140&nbsp;hp) drive train. The M80 option added two dark blue skunk stripes on top and a lower door stripe with the M80 identification. The package also added front and rear spoilers and 1981 steel rally wheels (sourced from the 1980 Monte Carlo).\n\nIn Mexico, General Motors produced this generation in the [[Ramos Arizpe Assembly|Ramos Arizpe plant]], which was sold during three years (1979 to 1981). Mexican versions came in three trim levels (Chevelle, Malibu and Malibu Classic) and two body styles (sedan and coupe) with the {{convert|250|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 as basic engine and the {{convert|350|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} V8 as the optional; this engine was standard on Malibu Classic models during those three years. This was possible because the Mexican emissions regulations remained relatively free at the time.\n\n===Iraqi taxi===\nIn 1981, [[General Motors Canada|General Motors of Canada]] in [[Oshawa]] produced a special order of 25,500 four-door Malibu sedans for [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]]i government. The deal was reportedly worth well over $100 million to GMCL. These special-order Malibus carried the unusual combination of GM's lowest-power carburated V6, the {{convert|110|hp|abbr=on}} {{convert|229|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} engine mated to three-speed manual transmission with a unique on-the-floor stick shifter. All of the cars were equipped with air conditioning, heavy duty cooling systems, AM/FM cassette decks, front bench seats, 200&nbsp;km/h speedometers, tough tweed and vinyl upholstery and {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} body-color stamped steel wheels with small \"dog dish\" hubcaps.\n\nHowever, only 13,000 units ever made it to Iraq, with the majority of the cars becoming taxis in [[Baghdad]] (once the cab-identifying orange paint was added to the front and rear fenders){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}. With the remaining balance of about 12,500 additional Malibus either sitting on a dock in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] or awaiting port shipment in [[Oshawa]], where they were built, the Iraqis suddenly cancelled the order in 1982.<ref>{{cite news|agency=Reuters |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E3D71439F933A05750C0A964948260 |title=G.M.

This issue was eventually identified as being due to an apparent clutch release issue that eventually required on-site retrofitting by a crew of Canadian technicians sent to Iraq to support the infamous \"Recall in the Desert\". Later speculation was that the Iraqis were actually forced to back out for financial reasons, due to their escalating hostilities with [[Iran]] requiring the immediate diversion of funds to support the Iraqi war effort. Then GM of Canada President Donald Hackworth was initially quoted as stating GMCL intended to still try to sell the Malibus overseas in other Middle East markets; however in the end, the orphaned \"Iraqi Taxi\" Malibus were all sold to the Canadian public at the greatly reduced price of about [[Canadian dollar|C$]]6,800. Over the years, they have acquired a low-key 'celebrity' status, sometimes being colloquially referred to as \"Iraqibu\".<ref>http://www.curbsideclassic.com/blog/automotive-history-snapshot-1981-chevrolet-malibu-iraqi-taxi/</ref><ref>https://jalopnik.com/this-chevy-malibu-tells-a-far-out-story-from-a-far-away-856827455</ref>\n\n===NASCAR===\nThe Malibu was an extensively used body style in [[NASCAR]] competition from 1973 to 1983. The Laguna S-3 variant, in particular, was successful during the 1975 through 1977 racing seasons, with [[Cale Yarborough]] winning 20 races in those years as well as winning the NASCAR championship one year. Because it was considered a limited edition model, NASCAR declared it ineligible for competition following the 1977 season, even though (given NASCARs three-year eligibility rule) it should have been allowed to run through 1979. Beginning in 1981, the downsized Malibu body style was eligible to run, but given its boxy shape, only one driver [[Dave Marcis]] ran it in 1981 and 1982, with one victory in a rain-shortened [[Capital City 400|Richmond 400]] at [[Richmond International Raceway|Richmond]] in 1982, the independent driver's last win.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:'79 Chevrolet Malibu Sedan (Orange Julep).JPG |1979 Chevrolet Malibu sedan\nFile:Chevrolet Malibu Coupe (Orange Julep).jpg|Chevrolet Malibu coupe\nFile:Chevrolet Malibu Landau BW 2016-09-03 14-13-26.jpg|1978 Chevrolet Malibu coupe\nFile:1982 Chevrolet Malibu Station Wagon (11265825623).jpg|1982 Chevrolet Malibu wagon\nFile:Chevrolet_Malibu_classic.jpg|Chevrolet Malibu Classic made and sold in Mexico\n</gallery>\n\n===Engines===\nThe base {{convert|200|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V-6 engine for the 1978 Chevrolet Malibu developed just {{convert|95|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} with optional upgrade to a {{convert|105|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} V-6, or {{convert|145|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} V-8.

GM phased out the L platform Corsica/Beretta where a new midsize was introduced in the wake of GM phasing out its B platform (at this time the Chevrolet Lumina was the largest car). All N-body Malibus were produced at the [[Oklahoma City Assembly]] plant (after 2002 it was retooled to build the [[GM GMT platform#GMT 360|GMT360]] [[SUV]]s) and the [[Wilmington Assembly]] plant (1997 to 1999), before moving production to [[Lansing, Michigan]]. The Wilmington plant was retooled to build the [[Saturn L-Series]] in 1999.

Minor changes were made to the center console to deliver a longer armrest said to be more comfortable and a pair of cup holders and mobile-phone bins instead of the previous covered storage area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Car and Driver|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-chevrolet-malibu-photos-and-info-news}}</ref> The Chinese model received a refreshed front end with revised [[headlamp]]s.{{CN|date=March 2020}}\n\nAmong the technology that Chevrolet debuted on the 2014 Malibu was a new six-speed transmission. Because the transmission was designed to reduce the energy required to pump transmission fluid, it contributed to fuel savings on the refreshed Malibu. In addition, for the first time in a non-hybrid GM vehicle, an engine stop/start system came standard with the 2.5&nbsp;L engine.<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewdepaula/2013/08/31/2014-chevrolet-malibu-gets-standard-stopstart-technology/ \"The 2014 Chevrolet Malibu Makes Stop/Start Technology Standard (And Why It Matters)\"] from ''Forbes'' (August 31, 2013)</ref> EPA fuel-economy estimates showed an improvement to 25/36 mpg city/highway, up from the 2013 model's 22/34 for the base 2.5&nbsp;L engine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fuel Economy.Gov|url= http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=32970&id=34311}}</ref> The 2014 Malibu was available for purchase in late 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=2014 Chevrolet Malibu Spy Photos|url= http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-chevrolet-malibu-spy-photos-news|accessdate=July 13, 2015}}</ref> \n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|ninth}} Ninth generation (2016\u2013present)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Ninth generation\n| image = 2017 Chevrolet Malibu LT front 3.27.18.jpg\n| aka = Chevrolet Malibu XL (China)\n| production = 2015\u2013present\n| model_years = 2016\u2013present\n| assembly = United States: [[General Motors Fairfax Assembly Plant|GM Fairfax Assembly]], [[Kansas City, Kansas]]<br />China: [[Shanghai]], [[China]] ([[SAIC-GM]])<br />South Korea: [[Bupyeong District|Bupyeong]], [[South Korea]] ([[GM Korea]])<br />Uzbekistan: [[Tashkent]] ([[GM Uzbekistan]])\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, front-wheel-drive]]\n| platform = [[GM Epsilon platform#E2XX|E2XX platform]]\n| related = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick Regal#Fifth generation (2010\u2013present)|Buick Regal]]|[[Holden Commodore (ZB)]]|[[Opel Insignia]]}}\n| designer = Jaymer Starbody (2012)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Migliore|first1=Greg|title=2016 Chevy Malibu gets premium looks, hybrid model|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2015/04/01/2016-chevy-malibu-hybrid-official/|website=Autoblog|date=April 1, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}</ref>\n| engine = {{unbulleted list|1.35 L ''[[L3T]]'' [[Straight-3 engine|I3]] [[turbocharger|turbo]] (gasoline)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Centeno |first1=Deivis |title=2019 Chevy Malibu Gets All-New 1.3L Turbo Three-Cylinder Engine In South Korea |url=https://gmauthority.com/blog/2018/11/2019-chevy-malibu-gets-all-new-1-3l-turbo-three-cylinder-engine-in-south-korea/ |website=GM Authority |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref>|1.5 L [[GM small gasoline engine#LFV|''LFV'']] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] [[turbocharger|turbo]] (gasoline)|2.0 L ''[[GM Ecotec engine#LTG|LTG]]'' I4 [[turbocharger|turbo]] (gasoline)|1.8 L ''[[GM Medium Gasoline Engine|LKN]]'' I4 [[GM Voltec powertrain|hybrid]] (gasoline)}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list|6-speed GM ''[[GM 6T40 transmission|6T45]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]]|8-speed Aisin ''[[AWF8F35|AWF8F45]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]] (2016 only) | 9-speed GM 9T50 (M3E) (2017-) | GM Voltec 5ET50 (MKE) (2016-2019) Multi-mode two motor, electronic continuously-variable automatic transaxle (Hybrid model)| GM CVT250 (MRG) CVT (2019-)}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|111.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|193.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|73.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|57.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|3086|-|3457|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url= http://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/vehicles/malibu/2016.tab1.html|title=2016 Chevrolet Malibu Specifications |work=Chevrolet Pressroom |accessdate=February 5, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\nOn April 1, 2015, Chevrolet unveiled a redesigned Malibu at the 2015 [[New York Auto Show]], which went on sale in late 2015 as a 2016 model.

The ''Political Wing'' also contacted the several right-wing Islamists and conservatives, promising an election, with PNA power-sharing the government with Zia.

He became the first engineering officer to have acknowledge Zia about the success of this energy project into a fully matured programme.

In 2004, Abdul Khan's dismissal from the nuclear weapons programme was considered a face saving exercise by the Pakistan Armed Forces and political establishment under the then Chief of Army Staff and President General [[Pervez Musharraf]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1025193,00.html The Man Who Sold the Bomb], Time.com Sunday, 6 February 2005</ref> Zia's nuclear proliferation policy had a deep impact on the world, especially anti-western states, most nominally North Korea and Iran. In the 2000s (decade), North Korea would soon follow the same suit after it was targeted by the international community for its on-going [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear programme]]. In the 2000s (decade), North Korea attempted to aid the [[Syria and weapons of mass destruction|Syrian]] and [[Iranian nuclear programme]]s in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Printwise Publications\"/> The North Korean connection to the Syrian nuclear programme was exposed in 2007 by Israel in its successful strategic operation, [[Operation Orchard|''Orchard'']], which resulted in them sabotaging the Syrian nuclear programme as well as the deaths of 10 senior North-Korean scientists who were aiding the nuclear program.\n\n====Expansion====\n\nEven though Zia had removed the Bhutto sentiment in the nuclear energy project, Zia did not completely disband Bhutto's policy on nuclear weapons.  After the retirement of Zahid Ali Akbar, Zia transferred control of the nuclear weapons programme to Bhutto's close aide Munir Ahmad Khan, Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. Soon, Zia promoted Khan as the technical director of the entire programme as well as appointing Khan as his Science Adviser.<ref name=\"Printwise Publications\"/> With the support of handpicked civilian Prime Minister [[Muhammad Khan Junejo|Muhammad Juneijo]], Zia sanctioned the launch of the 50 [[Megawatt]] (MW) heavy water plutonium production reactor, known as [[Khushab Nuclear Complex|''Khushab-I'']], at [[Khushab]] in 1985.<ref name=\"Printwise Publications\"/> Zia also took initiatives to launched the space projects as spin-off to nuclear project.<ref name=\"Printwise Publications\"/> Zia appointed nuclear engineer [[Salim Mehmud]] as the Administrator of the [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission|Space Research Commission]].<ref name=\"Salim Mehmud (Nuclear engineer, PhD)\">{{cite web |last=Mehmud|first=Salim PhD (Nuclear Engineering) |title=Pakistan and Earth Observational System (EOS) |publisher= }}{{Full citation needed|date=June 2015}}</ref> Zia also launched the work on the country's first satellite, ''[[Badr-1]]'', a military satellite.<ref name=\"Salim Mehmud (Nuclear engineer, PhD)\"/> In 1987, Zia launched the clandestine aerospace project, the [[Pakistani missile research and development program|Integrated Missile Research Programme]] under General [[Anwar Shamim]] in 1985, and later under Lieutenant-General [[Talat Masood]] in 1987.<ref>Lodi, Lieutenant General Safdar F.S. (May 1998). \"Pakistan's Missile Technology\". Head of Integrated Missile Research and Development Programme (IMRDP). Defence Journal of Pakistan.</ref>\n\n==== International standing enhancement and resumption of aid ====\nZia's international standing greatly rose after his declaration to fight the Soviet invaders. [[Pakistan\u2013United States relations]] took a much more positive turn. US President [[Jimmy Carter]] and his Secretary of State, [[Cyrus Vance]], cut off US aid to Pakistan on the grounds that Pakistan had not made sufficient progress on the nuclear issue. Then, on 25 December 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and Carter offered Pakistan $325&nbsp;million in aid over three years. Zia rejected this as \"peanuts.\"<ref>The Bear Trap, Brig. Muhammad Yousuf {{Full citation needed|date=June 2015}}</ref> Carter also signed the finding in 1980 that allowed less than $50&nbsp;million a year to go to the Mujahideen. After [[Ronald Reagan]] came to office, defeating Carter for the US Presidency in 1980, all this changed, due to President Reagan's new priorities and the unlikely and remarkably effective effort by Congressman [[Charlie Wilson (Texas politician)|Charles Wilson]] aided by [[Joanne Herring]], and CIA Afghan Desk Chief [[Gust Avrakotos]] to increase the funding for [[Operation Cyclone]]. Aid to the Afghan resistance, and to Pakistan, increased substantially, finally reaching $1&nbsp;billion. The United States, faced with a rival superpower looking as if it were to create another Communist bloc, now engaged Zia to fight a US-aided [[Proxy war|war by proxy]] in Afghanistan against the Soviets.\n\n==== Fighting the war by proxy ====\nZia now found himself in a position to demand billions of dollars in aid for the [[mujahideen]] from the Western states, famously dismissing a United States proposed $325&nbsp;million aid package as \"peanuts\". Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] and [[Special Service Group]] now became actively involved in the conflict, and in co-operation with the Central Intelligence Agency and the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]] supported the armed struggle against the Soviets.\n\nIn 1981, Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter as President of the United States. Reagan was completely against the Soviet Union and its [[Satellite state|communist satellites]], dubbing it \"the [[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]\". Reagan now increased financial aid heading for Pakistan. In 1981, the Reagan Administration sent the first of 40 [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 jet fighters]] to the Pakistanis. But the Soviets kept control of the Afghan skies until the mujahideen received [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger missiles]] in 1986. From that moment on, the mujahideen's strategic position steadily improved.\n\nThe Soviets declared a policy of national reconciliation. In January they announced that a Soviet withdrawal was no longer linked to the makeup of the Afghan government remaining behind. Pakistan, with the massive extra-governmental and covert backing from the largest operation ever mounted by the CIA and financial support of [[Saudi Arabia]], therefore, played a large part in the eventual withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in 1988.\n\n==== The war legacy ====\nThe rise of the illicit drug trade and its spread through Pakistan to the rest of the world increased tremendously during the Soviet-Afghan war. Afghanistan's drug industry began to take off after the Soviet invasion in 1979. Desperate for cash with which to buy weapons, various elements in the anti-Communist resistance turned to the drug trade. This was tolerated if not condoned by their American sponsors such as the CIA.<ref>Richard McGill Murphy (16 October 1997) [https://www.forbes.com/1997/10/16/feat.html The Afghanistan Drug Trade], Forbes.com</ref>\n\n==='Sharization' of Pakistan===\n{{main|Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization}}\nThe \"primary\" policy,<ref name=\"Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (July 2005)\"/> \nor \"centerpiece\" of Zia's government was \"Sharization\" or \"Islamization\".<ref name=jones-16>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Owen Bennett|title=Pakistan : eye of the storm|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pakistaneyeofsto00benn/page/16 16]\u20137|url=https://archive.org/details/pakistaneyeofsto00benn|url-access=registration|quote=...

Junejo also gave Benazir a seat next to him in parleys before that. Junejo did not strengthen the Islamization drive and rather weakened it. His era led to serious disturbances in Karachi and ultimately Karachi went into the secular control of MQM from the clutches of Sunnis Jamaat-e-Islami.\n\n[[Ojhri Camp]] blast had irreversibly weakened Zia.\n\nOn 29 May 1988, Zia dissolved the National Assembly and removed the Prime Minister under article 58(2)b of the amended Constitution. Apart from many other reasons, Prime Minister Junejo's decision to sign the [[Geneva Accord (1988)|Geneva Accord]] against the wishes of Zia, and his open declarations of removing any military personnel found responsible for an explosion at a munitions dump at [[Ojhri Camp]], on the outskirts of army headquarters in [[Rawalpindi]], earlier in the year, proved to be some of the major factors responsible for his removal.\n\nZia promised to hold [[1988 Pakistani general election|elections in 1988]] after the dismissal of Junejo government. He said that he would hold elections within the next 90 days. The late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's daughter [[Benazir Bhutto]] had returned from [[exile]] earlier in 1986, and had announced that she would be contesting the elections. With Bhutto's popularity somewhat growing, and a decrease in international aid following the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Zia was in an increasingly difficult political situation.\n\n== Death ==\n{{Main|Death and state funeral of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq}}\n\nZia died in a plane crash on 17 August 1988.

The ''Political Wing'' also contacted the several right-wing Islamists and conservatives, promising an election, with PNA power-sharing the government with Zia. Zia successfully divided and separated the secular forces from right-wing Islamists and conservatives, and later purged each member of the secular front.<ref name=\"Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (July 2005)\"/>\n\nA Disqualification Tribunal was formed, and several individuals who had been members of parliament were charged with [[malpractice]] and disqualified from participating in politics at any level for the next seven years.<ref name=\"Pakistan Muslim League\"/> A [[white paper]] document was issued, incriminating the deposed Bhutto government on several counts.<ref name=\"Pakistan Muslim League\"/>\n\nIt is reported by senior officers that when Zia met federal secretaries for the first time as leader of the country after martial law, he said that \"He does not possess the charisma of Bhutto, personality of [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] or the legitimacy of [[Liaquat Ali Khan]]\" thereby implying how can he be marketed.<ref name=\"Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (July 2005)\"/>\n\n== Reign as Chief Martial Law Administrator ==\nAfter deposing Prime Minister Bhutto on 5 July 1977, Zia-ul-Haq declared martial law, and appointed himself Chief Martial Law Administrator, which he remained until becoming president on 16 September 1978.\n\n=== The Doctrine of Necessity ===\n{{Main|Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization}}\n[[Nusrat Bhutto]], the wife of the deposed Prime Minister, filed a suit against Zia's [[Military dictatorship|military regime]], challenging the validity of the July 1977 military coup. The [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] ruled, in what would later be known as the ''Doctrine of Necessity'' (not to be confused with the 1954 [[Doctrine of necessity]]) that, given the dangerously unstable political situation of the time, Zia's overthrowing of the Bhutto government was legal on the grounds of [[Military necessity|necessity]]. The judgement tightened the general's hold on the government.

No actions towards privatising the industries were ordered by President Zia; only three steel mill industries were returned to its previous owners.\n\nBy the end of 1987, the [[Ministry of Finance (Pakistan)|Finance ministry]] had begun studying the process of engaging the gradual privatisation and economic liberalisation.\n\n=== Soviet-Afghan War and Strategic initiatives ===\n\n==== Soviet invasion and Soviet\u2013Afghan War ====\n{{Main|Soviet\u2013Afghan War}}\nOn 25 December 1979, the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|intervened in Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"Jang Publishers, 1991\">{{cite book |last=Yousaf, PA |first=Brigadier General (retired) Mohammad |title=Silent soldier: the man behind the Afghan jehad General Akhtar Abdur Rahman |year=1991 |publisher=Jang Publishers, 1991 |location=Karachi, Sindh |pages=106 pages |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cAoNAAAAIAAJ&q=Silent+soldier:+The+man+behind+the+Afghan+Jehad+by+Mohammad+Yousaf&dq=Silent+soldier:+The+man+behind+the+Afghan+Jehad+by+Mohammad+Yousaf}}</ref>  Following this invasion, Zia chaired a meeting and was asked by several cabinet members to refrain from interfering in the war, owing to the vastly superior military power of the USSR<ref name=\"Jang Publishers, 1991\"/> Zia, however, was ideologically opposed to the idea of communism taking over a neighbouring country, supported by the fear of Soviet advancement into Pakistan, particularly Balochistan, in search of warm waters, and made no secret about his intentions of monetarily and militarily aiding the Afghan resistance (the Mujahideen) with major assistance from the United States.<ref name=\"Jang Publishers, 1991\"/>\n\nDuring this meeting, the [[Director-General]] of the [[Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) then-Lieutenant-General [[Akhtar Abdur Rahman]] advocated for a covert operation in Afghanistan by arming Islamic extremists.<ref name=\"Jang Publishers, 1991\"/> During this meeting, General Rahman was heard saying: \"''Kabul must burn!

Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrei Gromyko]] and new Secretary General [[Yuri Andropov]] met with Zia there. Andropov expressed indignation over Pakistan's support of the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union and its satellite state, [[Socialist Afghanistan]]. Zia took his hand and assured him, \"General Secretary, believe me, Pakistan wants nothing but very good relations with the Soviet Union\".<ref  name=\"Hyman1989p35-36\" /> According to Gromyko, Zia's sincerity convinced them, but Zia's actions didn't live up to his words.<ref name=\"Hyman1989p35-36\">{{harvnb|Hyman|Ghayur|Kaushik|1989|pp=35\u201336}}</ref>\n\nZia reversed many of Bhutto's foreign policy initiatives by first establishing stronger links with the United States, Japan, and the Western world.<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite news |last=Editorial |title=Tricky diplomacy |url=http://www.economist.com/node/1957930 |work=The Economist |accessdate=4 January 2012 |date=31 July 2003}}</ref> Zia broken off relations with the [[Socialist state]] and [[State capitalism]] became his major economic policy.

This whole giant [[Kahuta Project|nuclear energy project]] was transferred into the administrative hands of Major-General Akbar who was soon made the Lieutenant-General and [[Engineer-in-Chief (Pakistan Army)|Engineer-in-Chief]] of the [[Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers]] to deal with the authorities whose co-operation was required. Akbar consolidated the entire project by placing the scientific research under military control, setting boundaries and goals. Akbar proved to be an extremely capable officer in the matters of science and technology when he aggressively led the development of nuclear weapons under Munir Ahmad Khan and Abdul Qadeer Khan in a matter of five years.<ref name=\"Printwise Publications\"/>\n\nBy the time, Zia assumed control, the research facilities became fully functional and 90% of the work on atom bomb project was completed.  Both the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC) and the [[Khan Research Laboratories]] (KRL) had built the extensive research infrastructure started by Bhutto.  Akbar's office was shifted to Army's [[General Headquarters (Pakistan Army)|General Headquarters (GHQ)]] and Akbar guided Zia on key matters of nuclear science and atomic bomb production. He became the first engineering officer to have acknowledge Zia about the success of this energy project into a fully matured programme. On the recommendation of Akbar, Zia approved the appointment of Munir Ahmad Khan as the scientific director of the atomic bomb project, as Zia was convinced by Akbar that civilian scientists under Munir Khan's directorship were at their best to counter international pressure.<ref name=\"Printwise Publications\"/>\n\nThis was proved when the PAEC conducted the cold-fission test of a fission device, codename ''[[Kirana-I]]'' on 11 March 1983 at the [[Kirana Hills|Weapon-Testing Laboratories-I]], under the leadership of weapon-testing laboratory's director Dr. [[Ishfaq Ahmad]].<ref name=\"Printwise Publications\"/> Lieutenant-General Zahid Akbar went to GHQ and notified Zia about the success of this test.

In 2004, Abdul Khan's dismissal from the nuclear weapons programme was considered a face saving exercise by the Pakistan Armed Forces and political establishment under the then Chief of Army Staff and President General [[Pervez Musharraf]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1025193,00.html The Man Who Sold the Bomb], Time.com Sunday, 6 February 2005</ref> Zia's nuclear proliferation policy had a deep impact on the world, especially anti-western states, most nominally North Korea and Iran. In the 2000s (decade), North Korea would soon follow the same suit after it was targeted by the international community for its on-going [[North Korea and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear programme]]. In the 2000s (decade), North Korea attempted to aid the [[Syria and weapons of mass destruction|Syrian]] and [[Iranian nuclear programme]]s in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Printwise Publications\"/> The North Korean connection to the Syrian nuclear programme was exposed in 2007 by Israel in its successful strategic operation, [[Operation Orchard|''Orchard'']], which resulted in them sabotaging the Syrian nuclear programme as well as the deaths of 10 senior North-Korean scientists who were aiding the nuclear program.\n\n====Expansion====\n\nEven though Zia had removed the Bhutto sentiment in the nuclear energy project, Zia did not completely disband Bhutto's policy on nuclear weapons.  After the retirement of Zahid Ali Akbar, Zia transferred control of the nuclear weapons programme to Bhutto's close aide Munir Ahmad Khan, Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. Soon, Zia promoted Khan as the technical director of the entire programme as well as appointing Khan as his Science Adviser.<ref name=\"Printwise Publications\"/> With the support of handpicked civilian Prime Minister [[Muhammad Khan Junejo|Muhammad Juneijo]], Zia sanctioned the launch of the 50 [[Megawatt]] (MW) heavy water plutonium production reactor, known as [[Khushab Nuclear Complex|''Khushab-I'']], at [[Khushab]] in 1985.<ref name=\"Printwise Publications\"/> Zia also took initiatives to launched the space projects as spin-off to nuclear project.<ref name=\"Printwise Publications\"/> Zia appointed nuclear engineer [[Salim Mehmud]] as the Administrator of the [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission|Space Research Commission]].<ref name=\"Salim Mehmud (Nuclear engineer, PhD)\">{{cite web |last=Mehmud|first=Salim PhD (Nuclear Engineering) |title=Pakistan and Earth Observational System (EOS) |publisher= }}{{Full citation needed|date=June 2015}}</ref> Zia also launched the work on the country's first satellite, ''[[Badr-1]]'', a military satellite.<ref name=\"Salim Mehmud (Nuclear engineer, PhD)\"/> In 1987, Zia launched the clandestine aerospace project, the [[Pakistani missile research and development program|Integrated Missile Research Programme]] under General [[Anwar Shamim]] in 1985, and later under Lieutenant-General [[Talat Masood]] in 1987.<ref>Lodi, Lieutenant General Safdar F.S.

Defence Journal of Pakistan.</ref>\n\n==== International standing enhancement and resumption of aid ====\nZia's international standing greatly rose after his declaration to fight the Soviet invaders. [[Pakistan\u2013United States relations]] took a much more positive turn. US President [[Jimmy Carter]] and his Secretary of State, [[Cyrus Vance]], cut off US aid to Pakistan on the grounds that Pakistan had not made sufficient progress on the nuclear issue. Then, on 25 December 1979, the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and Carter offered Pakistan $325&nbsp;million in aid over three years. Zia rejected this as \"peanuts.\"<ref>The Bear Trap, Brig. Muhammad Yousuf {{Full citation needed|date=June 2015}}</ref> Carter also signed the finding in 1980 that allowed less than $50&nbsp;million a year to go to the Mujahideen. After [[Ronald Reagan]] came to office, defeating Carter for the US Presidency in 1980, all this changed, due to President Reagan's new priorities and the unlikely and remarkably effective effort by Congressman [[Charlie Wilson (Texas politician)|Charles Wilson]] aided by [[Joanne Herring]], and CIA Afghan Desk Chief [[Gust Avrakotos]] to increase the funding for [[Operation Cyclone]]. Aid to the Afghan resistance, and to Pakistan, increased substantially, finally reaching $1&nbsp;billion. The United States, faced with a rival superpower looking as if it were to create another Communist bloc, now engaged Zia to fight a US-aided [[Proxy war|war by proxy]] in Afghanistan against the Soviets.\n\n==== Fighting the war by proxy ====\nZia now found himself in a position to demand billions of dollars in aid for the [[mujahideen]] from the Western states, famously dismissing a United States proposed $325&nbsp;million aid package as \"peanuts\". Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] and [[Special Service Group]] now became actively involved in the conflict, and in co-operation with the Central Intelligence Agency and the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]] supported the armed struggle against the Soviets.\n\nIn 1981, Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter as President of the United States. Reagan was completely against the Soviet Union and its [[Satellite state|communist satellites]], dubbing it \"the [[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]\". Reagan now increased financial aid heading for Pakistan. In 1981, the Reagan Administration sent the first of 40 [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 jet fighters]] to the Pakistanis. But the Soviets kept control of the Afghan skies until the mujahideen received [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger missiles]] in 1986. From that moment on, the mujahideen's strategic position steadily improved.\n\nThe Soviets declared a policy of national reconciliation. In January they announced that a Soviet withdrawal was no longer linked to the makeup of the Afghan government remaining behind. Pakistan, with the massive extra-governmental and covert backing from the largest operation ever mounted by the CIA and financial support of [[Saudi Arabia]], therefore, played a large part in the eventual withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in 1988.\n\n==== The war legacy ====\nThe rise of the illicit drug trade and its spread through Pakistan to the rest of the world increased tremendously during the Soviet-Afghan war. Afghanistan's drug industry began to take off after the Soviet invasion in 1979. Desperate for cash with which to buy weapons, various elements in the anti-Communist resistance turned to the drug trade. This was tolerated if not condoned by their American sponsors such as the CIA.<ref>Richard McGill Murphy (16 October 1997) [https://www.forbes.com/1997/10/16/feat.html The Afghanistan Drug Trade], Forbes.com</ref>\n\n==='Sharization' of Pakistan===\n{{main|Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization}}\nThe \"primary\" policy,<ref name=\"Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (July 2005)\"/> \nor \"centerpiece\" of Zia's government was \"Sharization\" or \"Islamization\".<ref name=jones-16>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Owen Bennett|title=Pakistan : eye of the storm|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pakistaneyeofsto00benn/page/16 16]\u20137|url=https://archive.org/details/pakistaneyeofsto00benn|url-access=registration|quote=...

Junejo also gave Benazir a seat next to him in parleys before that. Junejo did not strengthen the Islamization drive and rather weakened it. His era led to serious disturbances in Karachi and ultimately Karachi went into the secular control of MQM from the clutches of Sunnis Jamaat-e-Islami.\n\n[[Ojhri Camp]] blast had irreversibly weakened Zia.\n\nOn 29 May 1988, Zia dissolved the National Assembly and removed the Prime Minister under article 58(2)b of the amended Constitution. Apart from many other reasons, Prime Minister Junejo's decision to sign the [[Geneva Accord (1988)|Geneva Accord]] against the wishes of Zia, and his open declarations of removing any military personnel found responsible for an explosion at a munitions dump at [[Ojhri Camp]], on the outskirts of army headquarters in [[Rawalpindi]], earlier in the year, proved to be some of the major factors responsible for his removal.\n\nZia promised to hold [[1988 Pakistani general election|elections in 1988]] after the dismissal of Junejo government. He said that he would hold elections within the next 90 days. The late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's daughter [[Benazir Bhutto]] had returned from [[exile]] earlier in 1986, and had announced that she would be contesting the elections.

Her parents were both from ethnic minorities: her father Ja\u0161ar was [[Romani people in the Republic of Macedonia|Romani]] and her mother Sabrina [[Turks in the Republic of Macedonia|Turkish]]. Her father had already been married once, but as his wife could not have children, he remarried Usnija's mother. Sabrina already had two children from a previous marriage and she had four other children with Ja\u0161ar, including Usnija. Both her parents were Muslims. At the start of her career, Usnija Red\u017eepova put an emphasis on her Turkish heritage to minimise her Romani roots, although she never hid them as many Roma artists did at that time to avoid racism.<ref name=\"Globus2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.globusmagazin.com.mk/?ItemID=92F7A7E46E82A64B99DF50CAA152D5A0|title=\u0423\u0421\u041d\u0418\u0408\u0410 \u041d\u0410 \u0421\u041b\u0410\u041c\u041a\u0410 (2): \u0412\u041e \u0415\u041c\u0418\u0421\u0418\u0408\u0410\u0422\u0410 \"\u041c\u0418\u041a\u0420\u041e\u0424\u041e\u041d\u041e\u0422 \u0415 \u0412\u0410\u0428\" \u041d\u0415\u041c\u0410\u0428\u0415 \u041c\u0410\u041c\u0415\u040a\u0415|publisher=Globus|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nRed\u017eepova's family was very poor, living in a slum, but Usnija remembered her childhood as happy. Her mother was strict and cold-tempered, but her father was joyful and caring. He was from the D\u017eambaz community, known for its horse traders, but worked as a plumber. As a child, Usnija Red\u017eepova was very shy, a personality trait she kept her all life. She soon discovered however that she enjoyed being on stage during folk performances. Around 1963, she took part in a [[karaoke]] contest organised by Radio Skopje. She sang and danced ''Ajde da igramo tvist'' (\"Let's Dance [[Twist (dance)|Twist]]\"), a pop song by [[Radmila Karaklaji\u0107]]. Her performance was acclaimed and officials from the radio station tried to convince her father to let her become a professional singer. At that time, singing was not considered as a reputable career in the Romani community, especially for women. Her father wanted his daughter to finish her secondary studies and become a good wife. Even after she had become famous, he would still be critical of the way his daughter dressed and acted on stage.<ref name=\"Globus2\"/>\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== Debut ===\nUsnija Red\u017eepova started performing soon after completing her secondary studies. Although she made come true her father's old dream to study Arabic at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology]], she had to sing in caf\u00e9s to get enough money to live. Most of her friends in Belgrade were from Macedonia and she met Nasko D\u017eorlev, a Macedonian musician who had his own ensemble. She joined them and toured Yugoslavia for 5 years.<ref name=\"Ibarske\">{{Cite journal|title=Indiferentna prema karijeri|author=T. Radovanovi\u0107|date=19 August 2011|page=20|journal=Ibarske Novine|url=http://issuu.com/novine/docs/ibarske_novosti_2975}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, she released her first disks, two [[extended play|EPs]] produced by [[Jugoton]], one of the largest Yugoslav labels. As [[Esma Red\u017eepova]], another singer from Macedonia, had already signed with Jugoton, the label decided to rename the singer \"Usnija Ja\u0161arova\" to avoid any confusion. \"Ja\u0161arova\" was made up with the forename of Usnija's father, Ja\u0161ar.<ref name=\"Ibarske\"/> The first EP was recorded in duet with another folk singer, Ivanka Jovanovska, while the second only contained songs by Usnija. The main title, ''D\u017eulo, D\u017eulo'', quickly became a hit in Yugoslavia. The two disks were recorded in Serbian but the singer released a third EP in 1968 containing only Romani songs. Together with Vaska Ilieva and An\u0111elka Govedarovi\u0107, two other folk singers, Usnija was sent to Australia in 1969 to perform for the Yugoslav diaspora. She also sang for the army in [[Croatia]] in 1971.<ref name=\"Globus2\"/>\n\n=== ''Ko\u0161tana'' ===\nBy 1973, Usnija Red\u017eepova had experienced success and had started a promising career. However, she was still studying at the university and was feeling very tired. She had not realised that her success was exceptional and had an unassuming approach to it. That year, [[\u017darko Jovanovi\u0107]], a prominent Serbian-Romani artist, wanted her to play in his new adaptation of ''[[Ko\u0161tana]]'', a popular play in Serbia telling the story of a Gypsy girl. As she had almost withdrawn from the scene, he was not able to find her until another Macedonian-Romani singer, [[Muharem Serbezovski]], introduced Red\u017eepova to him.<ref name=\"Ibarske\"/>\n\nAlthough Red\u017eepova was worried about having to play and sing in an academic setting, she joined the [[National Theatre in Belgrade]] to perform ''Ko\u0161tana''.

Her parents were both from ethnic minorities: her father Ja\u0161ar was [[Romani people in the Republic of Macedonia|Romani]] and her mother Sabrina [[Turks in the Republic of Macedonia|Turkish]]. Her father had already been married once, but as his wife could not have children, he remarried Usnija's mother. Sabrina already had two children from a previous marriage and she had four other children with Ja\u0161ar, including Usnija. Both her parents were Muslims. At the start of her career, Usnija Red\u017eepova put an emphasis on her Turkish heritage to minimise her Romani roots, although she never hid them as many Roma artists did at that time to avoid racism.<ref name=\"Globus2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.globusmagazin.com.mk/?ItemID=92F7A7E46E82A64B99DF50CAA152D5A0|title=\u0423\u0421\u041d\u0418\u0408\u0410 \u041d\u0410 \u0421\u041b\u0410\u041c\u041a\u0410 (2): \u0412\u041e \u0415\u041c\u0418\u0421\u0418\u0408\u0410\u0422\u0410 \"\u041c\u0418\u041a\u0420\u041e\u0424\u041e\u041d\u041e\u0422 \u0415 \u0412\u0410\u0428\" \u041d\u0415\u041c\u0410\u0428\u0415 \u041c\u0410\u041c\u0415\u040a\u0415|publisher=Globus|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nRed\u017eepova's family was very poor, living in a slum, but Usnija remembered her childhood as happy. Her mother was strict and cold-tempered, but her father was joyful and caring. He was from the D\u017eambaz community, known for its horse traders, but worked as a plumber. As a child, Usnija Red\u017eepova was very shy, a personality trait she kept her all life. She soon discovered however that she enjoyed being on stage during folk performances. Around 1963, she took part in a [[karaoke]] contest organised by Radio Skopje. She sang and danced ''Ajde da igramo tvist'' (\"Let's Dance [[Twist (dance)|Twist]]\"), a pop song by [[Radmila Karaklaji\u0107]]. Her performance was acclaimed and officials from the radio station tried to convince her father to let her become a professional singer. At that time, singing was not considered as a reputable career in the Romani community, especially for women. Her father wanted his daughter to finish her secondary studies and become a good wife. Even after she had become famous, he would still be critical of the way his daughter dressed and acted on stage.<ref name=\"Globus2\"/>\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== Debut ===\nUsnija Red\u017eepova started performing soon after completing her secondary studies. Although she made come true her father's old dream to study Arabic at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology]], she had to sing in caf\u00e9s to get enough money to live. Most of her friends in Belgrade were from Macedonia and she met Nasko D\u017eorlev, a Macedonian musician who had his own ensemble. She joined them and toured Yugoslavia for 5 years.<ref name=\"Ibarske\">{{Cite journal|title=Indiferentna prema karijeri|author=T.

As [[Esma Red\u017eepova]], another singer from Macedonia, had already signed with Jugoton, the label decided to rename the singer \"Usnija Ja\u0161arova\" to avoid any confusion. \"Ja\u0161arova\" was made up with the forename of Usnija's father, Ja\u0161ar.<ref name=\"Ibarske\"/> The first EP was recorded in duet with another folk singer, Ivanka Jovanovska, while the second only contained songs by Usnija. The main title, ''D\u017eulo, D\u017eulo'', quickly became a hit in Yugoslavia. The two disks where recorded in Serbian but the singer released a third EP in 1968 containing only Romani songs. Together with Vaska Ilieva and An\u0111elka Govedarovi\u0107, two other folk singers, Usnija was sent to Australia in 1969 to perform for the Yugoslav diaspora. She also sang for the army in [[Croatia]] in 1971.<ref name=\"Globus2\"/>\n\n=== ''Ko\u0161tana'' ===\nBy 1973, Usnija Red\u017eepova had experienced success and had started a promising career. However, she was still studying at the university and was feeling very tired. She had not realised that her success was exceptional and had an unassuming approach to it. That year, [[\u017darko Jovanovi\u0107]], a prominent Serbian-Romani artist, wanted her to play in his new adaptation of ''[[Ko\u0161tana]]'', a popular play in Serbia telling the story of a Gypsy girl. As she had almost withdrawn from the scene, he was not able to find her until another Macedonian-Romani singer, [[Muharem Serbezovski]], introduced Red\u017eepova to him.<ref name=\"Ibarske\"/>\n\nAlthough Red\u017eepova was worried about having to play and sing in an academic setting, she joined the [[National Theatre in Belgrade]] to perform ''Ko\u0161tana''.
