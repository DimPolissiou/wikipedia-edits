It is estimated in his 45-year career he carried out 450&nbsp;executions. A [[Shoemaking|cobbler]] by trade, Calcraft was initially recruited to flog juvenile offenders held in [[Newgate Prison]]. While selling meat pies on streets around the prison, Calcraft met the City of London's hangman, [[John Foxton]].\n\nAfter Foxton's death in 1829 the government appointed Calcraft the official Executioner for the City of London and Middlesex. Following this, his executioner services were in great demand throughout England. Nevertheless, some considered Calcraft incompetent, in particular for his controversial use of the [[Hanging#Short drop|short-drop]] hanging method in which the condemned were slowly strangled to death.\n\nBecause with Calcraft's methods the condemned took several minutes to die, to hasten death Calcraft would sometimes dramatically pull on legs or climb on shoulders in an effort to break a victim's neck. It has been speculated that Calcraft used these methods partly to entertain the crowds, sometimes numbering 30,000 spectators or more.\n\nExecutions in England were public until 1868. That year the law changed, mandating executions would take place privately and inside the prison. In 1868 Calcraft carried out the last public and first private executions. Among his executions were [[Marie Manning (murderer)|Marie and Frederick Manning]], the first husband and wife to be hanged together since 1700.\n\n==Early life==\nCalcraft was born in [[Great Baddow|Baddow]], near [[Chelmsford]], in 1800. He was a [[Shoemaking|cobbler]] by trade, but had also worked as a nightwatchman at [[Watney Combe & Reid|Reid's brewery]] in [[Clerkenwell]], London. While attempting to earn a living by selling meat pies on the streets around [[Newgate Prison]] he made the acquaintance of [[John Foxton]], who was the [[City of London]]'s hangman for 40&nbsp;years. That meeting led to his employment at Newgate to [[Flagellation|flog]] juvenile offenders, for which he was paid 10&nbsp;shillings a week.<ref name=odnb/>\n\n==Career as an executioner, 1829\u20131874==\n[[File:West View of Newgate by George Shepherd (1784-1862) (cropped).jpg|thumb|jpg|Newgate Prison in the mid-19th century.

The purpose of the hood was to prevent the prisoner seeing the hangman pull the lever that released the trapdoor&nbsp;\u2013 and thus attempting to jump at the critical moment&nbsp;\u2013 and to hide from spectators any agony on the dying prisoner's face.<ref name=FieldingP14>{{Harvnb|Fielding|2008|p=14}}</ref> After the noose had been secured around each victim's neck and the hangman had retired to a safe distance, the trapdoor was released. The bodies were left hanging for some time to ensure that death had occurred, before being lowered to the ground. Calcraft employed the [[Hanging#Short drop|short-drop]] method of execution, in which the drop through the trapdoor might be around {{convert|3|ft}} or so.  That was often insufficient to break the prisoner's neck, and therefore death was not always instantaneous, typically occurring slowly by strangulation. Historians Anthony Stokes and Theodore Dalrymple have suggested that Calcraft's \"controversial\" use of the short-drop allowed him a couple of minutes to entertain the large crowds of 30,000 plus that sometimes attended his public executions. \"Renowned for his poor taste\", he would sometimes swing from his victim's legs or climb onto their shoulders in an attempt to break their necks. In one of the first executions Calcraft carried out at the new Reading Gaol his victim, Thomas Jennings, took more than three minutes to die.<ref name=StokesDalrymplePP53-54>{{Harvnb|Stokes|Dalrymple|2007|pp=53\u201354}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 March 1856, Calcraft executed William Bousfield, but a threat he had received that he would be shot on the scaffold unnerved him. After releasing the bolt securing the trapdoor on which the condemned man was standing, Calcraft ran off, leaving Bousfield hanging; a few moments later Bousfield raised one of his legs to support himself on the platform. Calcraft's assistant tried to push the victim off, but Bousfield repeatedly succeeded in supporting himself. The officiating chaplain forced the frightened Calcraft to return to the scaffold, where he \"threw himself around his [Bousfield's] legs and by the force of his weight finally succeeded in strangling him\".<ref name=BlockHostettlerP38/> Calcraft's bungling became the subject of a popular ballad.{{sfn|Gatrell|1996|p=100|ps=none}}\n\nCalcraft was also reportedly nervous of executing [[Fenian Brotherhood|Fenians]], because of threats he had received. On 22 November 1867 he officiated at the public execution of William Philip Allen, Michael Larkin, and Michael O'Brien, who became known as the [[Manchester Martyrs]]. The three Fenians had been found guilty of the murder of a police officer, and were hanged together. Most accounts claim that Allen died almost instantaneously from a broken neck, but Larkin and O'Brien were not so fortunate. A Catholic priest in attendance, Father Gadd, reported that:\n{{quote|The other two ropes, stretched taut and tense by their breathing twitching burdens, were in ominous and distracting movement. The hangman had bungled!&nbsp;... Calcraft then descended into the pit and there finished what he could not accomplish from above. ''He killed Larkin''.<ref name=RoseP98>{{Harvnb|Rose|1970|p=98}}</ref>}}\n\nFather Gadd refused to allow Calcraft to dispatch O'Brien in the same way, and so \"for three-quarters of an hour the good priest [Father Gadd] knelt, holding the dying man's hands within his own, reciting the prayers for the dying. Then the long drawn out agony ended.\"<ref name=RoseP98/>\n\nTowards the end of his career the feeling began to be expressed in the press that Calcraft's age was catching up with him. On 15 November 1869, aged 69, Calcraft executed Joseph Welsh, for murder, at [[Maidstone Gaol]]. Reporting on the execution ''The Times'' commented that \"the adjustment of the rope was slow and bungling, and such as to show that Calcraft's age has unfitted him for his occupation\".<ref>{{citation |title=Execution in Maidstone Gaol\u2013Joseph Welsh |date=16 November 1869 |newspaper=The Times |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/773/91/120707754w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS102148464&dyn=36!xrn_764_0_CS102148464&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib |accessdate=8 September 2010}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Stephen Eliot |title= \"Going through all these things twice\" : a brief history of botched executions\" |journal=[[Otago Law Review]] |issue=7 |year=2012 |publisher=Faculty of Law, University of Otago |url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/journals/OtaLawRw/2012/7.html}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:executioner-william-calcraft.jpg|thumb|right|Calcraft in later years]]\n\nBy 1869 Calcraft's mother, Sarah, was living as a pauper in a [[workhouse]] at [[Hatfield Peverel]] near [[Chelmsford]].<ref name=odnb/> Calcraft was ordered to pay 3&nbsp;shillings a week towards her upkeep,<ref name=NYT/> to which he objected, arguing that his brother and sister should be made to help, and that he had three children of his own to support, although there is no record of his marriage.<ref name=odnb/>\n\nAfter reluctantly being forced to retire from office because of old age in 1874, Calcraft received a pension of 25&nbsp;shillings a week from the City of London and was succeeded as hangman by [[William Marwood]].{{sfn|Block|Hostettler|1997|pp=38\u201339|ps=none}} Although as a younger man Calcraft had been considered to be \"genial\", with a love of breeding rabbits, in his later years he was described as \"surly and sinister-looking, with long hair and beard, in scruffy black attire and a fob chain\".<ref name=odnb/>\n\nCalcraft died at Poole Street in [[Hoxton]], on 13 December 1879.<ref name=odnb>{{citation |last=Boasel |first1=G.

In turning his head round Mapp displaced the rope, and the noose was brought round almost under his chin, the consequence being that the fall not being immediately fatal, he struggled for half a minute before he died.|source=Account of the execution on 9&nbsp;April 1869 of John Mapp at Shrewsbury Gaol for the murder of a young girl, Catherine Lewis<ref>{{citation |title=The Execution at Shrewsbury: John Mapp |date=10 April 1869 |newspaper=The Times |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/510/116/120809286w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS168076938&dyn=67!xrn_762_0_CS168076938&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib |accessdate=9 September 2010}} {{subscription required}}</ref>}}\nAlthough Calcraft's career as a hangman spanned 45&nbsp;years, he appears to have been \"particularly incompetent\", frequently having to \"rush below the scaffold to pull on his victim's legs to hasten death\".<ref name=odnb/> Those being hanged had their arms pinioned to their sides with leather straps before being walked to the gallows, where they were placed on a trapdoor and their heads and faces covered with a white cap, or hood. The purpose of the hood was to prevent the prisoner seeing the hangman pull the lever that released the trapdoor&nbsp;\u2013 and thus attempting to jump at the critical moment&nbsp;\u2013 and to hide from spectators any agony on the dying prisoner's face.<ref name=FieldingP14>{{Harvnb|Fielding|2008|p=14}}</ref> After the noose had been secured around each victim's neck and the hangman had retired to a safe distance, the trapdoor was released. The bodies were left hanging for some time to ensure that death had occurred, before being lowered to the ground. Calcraft employed the [[Hanging#Short drop|short-drop]] method of execution, in which the drop through the trapdoor might be around {{convert|3|ft}} or so.  That was often insufficient to break the prisoner's neck, and therefore death was not always instantaneous, typically occurring slowly by strangulation. Historians Anthony Stokes and Theodore Dalrymple have suggested that Calcraft's \"controversial\" use of the short-drop allowed him a couple of minutes to entertain the large crowds of 30,000 plus that sometimes attended his public executions. \"Renowned for his poor taste\", he would sometimes swing from his victim's legs or climb onto their shoulders in an attempt to break their necks. In one of the first executions Calcraft carried out at the new Reading Gaol his victim, Thomas Jennings, took more than three minutes to die.<ref name=StokesDalrymplePP53-54>{{Harvnb|Stokes|Dalrymple|2007|pp=53\u201354}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 March 1856, Calcraft executed William Bousfield, but a threat he had received that he would be shot on the scaffold unnerved him. After releasing the bolt securing the trapdoor on which the condemned man was standing, Calcraft ran off, leaving Bousfield hanging; a few moments later Bousfield raised one of his legs to support himself on the platform. Calcraft's assistant tried to push the victim off, but Bousfield repeatedly succeeded in supporting himself. The officiating chaplain forced the frightened Calcraft to return to the scaffold, where he \"threw himself around his [Bousfield's] legs and by the force of his weight finally succeeded in strangling him\".<ref name=BlockHostettlerP38/> Calcraft's bungling became the subject of a popular ballad.{{sfn|Gatrell|1996|p=100|ps=none}}\n\nCalcraft was also reportedly nervous of executing [[Fenian Brotherhood|Fenians]], because of threats he had received. On 22 November 1867 he officiated at the public execution of William Philip Allen, Michael Larkin, and Michael O'Brien, who became known as the [[Manchester Martyrs]]. The three Fenians had been found guilty of the murder of a police officer, and were hanged together. Most accounts claim that Allen died almost instantaneously from a broken neck, but Larkin and O'Brien were not so fortunate. A Catholic priest in attendance, Father Gadd, reported that:\n{{quote|The other two ropes, stretched taut and tense by their breathing twitching burdens, were in ominous and distracting movement. The hangman had bungled!&nbsp;... Calcraft then descended into the pit and there finished what he could not accomplish from above. ''He killed Larkin''.<ref name=RoseP98>{{Harvnb|Rose|1970|p=98}}</ref>}}\n\nFather Gadd refused to allow Calcraft to dispatch O'Brien in the same way, and so \"for three-quarters of an hour the good priest [Father Gadd] knelt, holding the dying man's hands within his own, reciting the prayers for the dying. Then the long drawn out agony ended.\"<ref name=RoseP98/>\n\nTowards the end of his career the feeling began to be expressed in the press that Calcraft's age was catching up with him. On 15 November 1869, aged 69, Calcraft executed Joseph Welsh, for murder, at [[Maidstone Gaol]]. Reporting on the execution ''The Times'' commented that \"the adjustment of the rope was slow and bungling, and such as to show that Calcraft's age has unfitted him for his occupation\".<ref>{{citation |title=Execution in Maidstone Gaol\u2013Joseph Welsh |date=16 November 1869 |newspaper=The Times |url=http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/773/91/120707754w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS102148464&dyn=36!xrn_764_0_CS102148464&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib |accessdate=8 September 2010}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Stephen Eliot |title= \"Going through all these things twice\" : a brief history of botched executions\" |journal=[[Otago Law Review]] |issue=7 |year=2012 |publisher=Faculty of Law, University of Otago |url=http://www.nzlii.org/nz/journals/OtaLawRw/2012/7.html}}</ref>\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:executioner-william-calcraft.jpg|thumb|right|Calcraft in later years]]\n\nBy 1869 Calcraft's mother, Sarah, was living as a pauper in a [[workhouse]] at [[Hatfield Peverel]] near [[Chelmsford]].<ref name=odnb/> Calcraft was ordered to pay 3&nbsp;shillings a week towards her upkeep,<ref name=NYT/> to which he objected, arguing that his brother and sister should be made to help, and that he had three children of his own to support, although there is no record of his marriage.<ref name=odnb/>\n\nAfter reluctantly being forced to retire from office because of old age in 1874, Calcraft received a pension of 25&nbsp;shillings a week from the City of London and was succeeded as hangman by [[William Marwood]].{{sfn|Block|Hostettler|1997|pp=38\u201339|ps=none}} Although as a younger man Calcraft had been considered to be \"genial\", with a love of breeding rabbits, in his later years he was described as \"surly and sinister-looking, with long hair and beard, in scruffy black attire and a fob chain\".<ref name=odnb/>\n\nCalcraft died at Poole Street in [[Hoxton]], on 13 December 1879.<ref name=odnb>{{citation |last=Boasel |first1=G.

While at [[Oxford|Oxford University]], Cousins was a leading member of the University's [[Oxford University Liberal Club|Liberal Club]]. During the 1960s, he authored a pamphlet rejecting the \"new\" Labour of the [[Harold Wilson]] era. From 1967-72 he worked in industrial relations and as a research worker in industry. From 1972-82 he was a research worker in Urban Affairs and City Labour Markets. From 1982\u20137, he was a lecturer at [[University of Sunderland|Sunderland Polytechnic]].\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nOn the party's rebel left, Cousins briefly served on the party's front bench in a foreign affairs portfolio before being stripped of his position along with fellow frontbencher [[Ann Clwyd]] in 1995. The two MPs had been on a fact-finding tour of [[Kurdistan]], at that time being ravaged by Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]], and failed to return in time for a crucial Commons vote. As a key ally of the then Shadow Foreign Secretary [[Robin Cook]], Cousins was still hopeful of a ministerial job when Labour won the election in 1997, but his hopes were dashed and instead he became an influential member of the backbench Treasury Select Committee.\n\nAlthough Cousins has been described as a member of Labour's so-called awkward squad, his politics and indeed his personality are in reality more complex. He voted against the war in [[Iraq]] in 2003 and opposed the introduction of tuition fees in 2004, but on other matters - such as [[Tony Blair]]'s reforms of the [[National Health Service]], he remained loyal.\n\nThe [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] made a determined effort to target Cousins' Newcastle Central constituency in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], having taken control of [[Newcastle City Council]] the previous year, and Cousins saw his majority reduce from 11,605 to under 4,000.

While at [[Oxford|Oxford University]], Cousins was a leading member of the University's [[Oxford University Liberal Club|Liberal Club]]. During the 1960s, he authored a pamphlet rejecting the \"new\" Labour of the [[Harold Wilson]] era. From 1967-72 he worked in industrial relations and as a research worker in industry. From 1972-82 he was a research worker in Urban Affairs and City Labour Markets. From 1982-7, he was a lecturer at [[University of Sunderland|Sunderland Polytechnic]].\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nOn the party's rebel left, Cousins briefly served on the party's front bench in a foreign affairs portfolio before being stripped of his position along with fellow frontbencher [[Ann Clwyd]] in 1995. The two MPs had been on a fact-finding tour of [[Kurdistan]], at that time being ravaged by Iraqi dictator [[Saddam Hussein]], and failed to return in time for a crucial Commons vote. As a key ally of the then Shadow Foreign Secretary [[Robin Cook]], Cousins was still hopeful of a ministerial job when Labour won the election in 1997, but his hopes were dashed and instead he became an influential member of the backbench Treasury Select Committee.\n\nAlthough Cousins has been described as a member of Labour's so-called awkward squad, his politics and indeed his personality are in reality more complex. He voted against the war in [[Iraq]] in 2003 and opposed the introduction of tuition fees in 2004, but on other matters - such as [[Tony Blair]]'s reforms of the [[National Health Service]], he remained loyal.\n\nThe [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] made a determined effort to target Cousins' Newcastle Central constituency in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]], having taken control of [[Newcastle City Council]] the previous year, and Cousins saw his majority reduce from 11,605 to under 4,000. While unsuccessful in defeating Cousins, this result represented one of the largest swings in the country, possibly attributed to Liberal Democrat candidate Greg Stone's student-oriented campaign which focused on issues such as the [[Iraq|2003 invasion of Iraq]] and [[Top-up fees]]. In June 2009, Cousins announced that he would not be fighting to maintain his seat in the House of Commons at the next general election citing the health of his wife as the reason.\n\n==Personal life==\nHe is married to Anne Elizabeth.
