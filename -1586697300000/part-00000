The crew was horrifically slaughtered and their corpses are reanimated into creatures known as \"Necromorphs\". The various types of Necromorphs appeared throughout the game, each with different abilities and requiring different tactics to defeat. The game is played from an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective.<ref name=ignpreview1 />\n\n''Dead Space'' does not use a traditional [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]]. Instead, all information is relayed to the player via [[Holography|holographic projections]] from Isaac's Resource Integration Gear (RIG) spacesuit and the weapons themselves. For example, a small holographic display is mounted on Isaac's weapons to indicate the ammunition count while aiming. Also, the health meter is integrated into his suit spine and the spines of the suits that are worn by the other game characters.<ref name=gamespypreview1>{{cite web|last=Graziani|first=Gabe|title=Previews: Dead Space|work=GameSpy.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment|date=October 9, 2007|url=http://uk.xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/dead-space/825786p1.html|accessdate=May 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214075024/http://uk.xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/dead-space/825786p1.html|archive-date=February 14, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The player can check the current objectives and the 3D map via the floating holograms that are projected in front of Isaac or access the inventory screen to manage items or choose guns. However, the game still progresses in real-time during these activities so the player remains in danger of being attacked while browsing through menus and the map.<ref name=gamespypreview1 />\n\nCombat involves a mechanism called \"strategic [[dismemberment]]\" which the player must cut the limbs or sections of the individual Necromorphs off to defeat them. For example, shooting most Necromorphs in the head will have little effect and will only disorient them. However, they can be stopped once the player removes its arms and legs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deadspaceinformationsite.weebly.com/necromorphs.html |title=Necromorphs Dismemberment |date=January 16, 2015 |access-date=January 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121213704/http://deadspaceinformationsite.weebly.com/necromorphs.html |archive-date=January 21, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Depending on how they are wounded, the Necromorphs can adopt new stances and tactics such as sprouting new limbs or giving birth to new enemies in the process.<ref name=ignhandson>{{cite web|last=Haynes|first=Jeff|title=Dead Space Hands-on|work=IGN.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment|date=May 17, 2008|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/874/874895p1.html|accessdate=May 20, 2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68DDP7ZXO?url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/874/874895p1.html|archive-date=June 6, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with Isaac's profession as an engineer, the weapons in ''Dead Space'' are mostly improvised from the mining tools<ref name=gamespypreview1 /> such as a Plasma Cutter (For horizontal and vertical slicing), [[rotary saw]], a [[hydrazine]] torch (Repurposed as a [[flamethrower]]), a high-energy demolition beam and a cannon that emits powerful [[shock wave]]s. A military-grade [[automatic rifle]] is available and Isaac can also attack the enemies by clubbing them with his weapon or stomping on them. All weapons featured a secondary-fire mode. For example, the Plasma Cutter can be rotated 90 degrees for more effective dismemberment of vertical limbs (Such as legs on a normal [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] humanoid).<ref>{{cite web|first=Jeff|last=Haynes|url=http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/908/908187p1.html|title=Weapons of Dead Space|publisher=IGN|date=September 5, 2008|accessdate=December 18, 2011}}</ref> The player must scavenge for ammunition and items which are found throughout the ship or dropped by the Necromorphs when they are killed. The automated Stores throughout the ship can be accessed to buy and sell items or store them for later use. The player can use the [[workbench]]es to upgrade Isaac's suit and weapons.\n\nOther than weapons, Isaac is equipped with other tools to help him survive, solve puzzles and combat the enemies more effectively. Isaac's Stasis ability can be used to slow the enemies and objects down temporarily and a Kinesis module allows Isaac to move and throw the items sufficiently. The heavy or sharp objects can become improvised projectile weapons.<ref name=gamespypreview1 /> ''Dead Space'' features [[Weightlessness|zero gravity]] environments, through which Isaac can navigate by using magnetic boots.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Lark|title=Dead Space Review|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-space-review/1900-6200447/|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=October 31, 2014|accessdate=July 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331135937/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-space-review/1900-6200447/|archive-date=March 31, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Isaac's suit will protect him from the direct effects of [[vacuum]] or toxic environments, but it has a limited air supply and he will eventually [[Asphyxia|suffocate]] so the player is forced to proceed quickly when in these situations.\n\n==Plot==\n===Setting===\nBy the 23rd century humanity began to struggle under energy and resource shortages, which led to world government EarthGov researching solutions. To resolve resource shortages, Concordance Extraction Corporation (CEC) was formed to use \"planet-cracker\" spaceships to destroy and mine planets for resources.\n\nTo resolve the energy shortage, a team led by Michael Altman was sent to investigate an alien artifact found in the [[Chicxulub crater]], dubbed \"The Marker.\" Made from an unknown, black alien material, the marker was found to emit a sourceless [[electromagnetic field]] (EMF), making it a potential source of infinite energy. After a series of mysterious events and Altman's leaking of events, EarthGov unsuccessfully attempted to cover-up its existence. Those who believed Altman's claims saw his murder as [[martyrdom]] and markers as a unifying [[religious symbol]], leading to the Church of Unitology's creation.\n\nWanting to safely harness marker energy, EarthGov [[reverse engineer]]ed Red Markers from [[bismuth]] on some of their space colonies, only to discover the EMF that markers emit cause the living to suffer [[psychoses]] and [[hallucinations]] while making the dead mutate and reanimate as \"necromorphs.\" Knowing Unitologists would seek out additional markers and cause necromorph spread, EarthGov immediately terminated all marker research and prohibited travel to their locations.\n\n===Synopsis===\nSet in the year 2508, the CEC dispatches the ''USG Kellion'' to investigate a distress signal from the ''USG Ishimura'', a planet cracker in the process of mining Aegis VII. CEC Engineer Isaac Clarke volunteers himself for the mission as his girlfriend, Nicole Brennan, is the Chief Medical Officer aboard the ship. After a guidance system malfunction crashes the ''Kellion'' into the ''Ishimura'' dock, the crew exits to find the ship seemingly abandoned, only to be attacked by grotesque monsters. Split up by the ambush, the only ''Kellion'' survivors are Clarke, Commander Zach Hammond, and Computer Specialist Kendra Daniels. Hammond notices that many of the ship's systems are failing, and both he and Daniels direct Clarke repairing the ship and summoning rescue.\n\nPiecing together events from recordings, Clarke learns that Aegis VII travel is a prohibited by EarthGov, and that the ''Ishimura'' was performing an illegal mining operation. When Unitologists on the crew discovered a Red Marker on the surface, additional followers filled the ''Ishimura'' crew in an attempt to return it to Earth. Soon after the marker's extraction to the ''Ishimura'', large numbers of both the ship and planet crew began to suffer [[homicide|homicidal]] [[psychoses]]. Conflicts began to form between moderates, radicals and non-Unitologists, culminating with a mutiny against the Unitologist captain that ended in his accidental death. A disease carried within the marker then began to activate, transforming and reanimating colonist corpses as grotesque monsters; in an attempt to retrieve a necromorph for study, the disease was inadvertently spread to the ''Ishimura''.\n\nWhile Hammond states that he is unaware what the marker is, Daniels confides to Clarke that she believes Hammond is lying. Though unable to ignore ship repair duties, Clarke soon makes contact with Nicole and is able to briefly rendezvous with her.  After repairing the critical systems, Clarke's team launches the second rescue beacon, attracting the military vessel ''USM Valor''. Rescuing an escape pod containing a jettisoned necromorph, the ''Valor'' is rapidly overrun and crashes into the ''Ishimura''. Boarding the ''Valor'', Hammond deduces from the equipment and logs that the ship was dispatched to kill any survivors and destroy the ''Ishimura''. Clarke and Hammond retrieve a singularity core from the ''Valor'' to repair an available shuttle, but Hammond is killed by an enhanced Necromorph in the process. \n\nDr. Kyne, one of the few survivors of the ''Ishimura'', reveals himself to Clarke. Kyne urges Clarke to return the marker to Aegis VII, believing it will restrain the \"[[Group mind (science fiction)|Hive Mind]]\", the creature controlling the Necromorphs. After assisting Clarke in loading the marker onto the shuttle, Daniels murders Kyne, revealing herself as an operative sent to retrieve the Red Marker. Daniels leaves on the shuttle without Clarke, but Nicole helps Clarke recall the shuttle remotely, prompting Daniels to flee to Aegis VII in an escape pod. Clarke takes the marker back to the colony and sets it in place, pacifying the Hive Mind and creating a \"dead space\" that makes all Necromorphs in the surrounding area dormant. This also causes an [[electromagnetic pulse]], disrupting the [[Artificial gravity (fiction)|gravity tethers]] holding the cracked planet together, and initiating Aegis VII's collapse.\n\nStuck in a decontamination chamber, Clarke watches as Daniels reappears and removes the Red Marker from the pedestal, attempting to take it to her shuttle. Taunting Clarke, Daniels shows him the full distress transmission from Nicole, which reveals that Brennan committed suicide by lethal injection at the end of the transmission; Clarke's interactions with Nicole were Red Marker [[hallucinations]], caused to influence him into returning it to the planet. Before the marker can be loaded onto the shuttle The Hive Mind reawakens, violently killing Daniels and forcing Clarke to neutralize it. Boarding a shuttle as the colony and the marker are destroyed, Clarke narrowly escapes as the planet implodes. Clarke removes his helmet and watches Nicole's first transmission again, turning it off before she commits suicide. Clarke then notices something in his periphery, revealed to be a bloody vision of Nicole, which screams before the scene cuts to black.\n\n==Development==\n[[Electronic Arts]] announced ''Dead Space'' in September 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=EA Announce Dead Space|url=http://www.xbox360achievements.org/news/news-153-EA-Announce-Dead-Space.html|publisher=EA|accessdate=July 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909112201/http://www.xbox360achievements.org/news/news-153-EA-Announce-Dead-Space.html|archive-date=September 9, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref> The game was developed at their studio in [[Redwood Shores, California]].

The crew was horrifically slaughtered and their corpses are reanimated into creatures known as \"Necromorphs\". The various types of Necromorphs appeared throughout the game, each with different abilities and requiring different tactics to defeat. The game is played from an over-the-shoulder third-person perspective.<ref name=ignpreview1 />\n\n''Dead Space'' does not use a traditional [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]]. Instead, all information is relayed to the player via [[Holography|holographic projections]] from Isaac's Resource Integration Gear (RIG) spacesuit and the weapons themselves. For example, a small holographic display is mounted on Isaac's weapons to indicate the ammunition count while aiming. Also, the health meter is integrated into his suit spine and the spines of the suits that are worn by the other game characters.<ref name=gamespypreview1>{{cite web|last=Graziani|first=Gabe|title=Previews: Dead Space|work=GameSpy.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment|date=October 9, 2007|url=http://uk.xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/dead-space/825786p1.html|accessdate=May 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214075024/http://uk.xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/dead-space/825786p1.html|archive-date=February 14, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The player can check the current objectives and the 3D map via the floating holograms that are projected in front of Isaac or access the inventory screen to manage items or choose guns. However, the game still progresses in real-time during these activities so the player remains in danger of being attacked while browsing through menus and the map.<ref name=gamespypreview1 />\n\nCombat involves a mechanism called \"strategic [[dismemberment]]\" which the player must cut the limbs or sections of the individual Necromorphs off to defeat them. For example, shooting most Necromorphs in the head will have little effect and will only disorient them. However, they can be stopped once the player removes it's arms and legs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://deadspaceinformationsite.weebly.com/necromorphs.html |title=Necromorphs Dismemberment |date=January 16, 2015 |access-date=January 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121213704/http://deadspaceinformationsite.weebly.com/necromorphs.html |archive-date=January 21, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Depending on how they are wounded, the Necromorphs can adopt new stances and tactics such as sprouting new limbs or giving birth to new enemies in the process.<ref name=ignhandson>{{cite web|last=Haynes|first=Jeff|title=Dead Space Hands-on|work=IGN.com|publisher=IGN Entertainment|date=May 17, 2008|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/874/874895p1.html|accessdate=May 20, 2008|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/68DDP7ZXO?url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/874/874895p1.html|archive-date=June 6, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with Isaac's profession as an engineer, the weapons in ''Dead Space'' are mostly improvised from the mining tools<ref name=gamespypreview1 /> such as a Plasma Cutter (For horizontal and vertical slicing), [[rotary saw]], a [[hydrazine]] torch (Repurposed as a [[flamethrower]]), a high-energy demolition beam and a cannon that emits powerful [[shock wave]]s. A military-grade [[automatic rifle]] is available and Isaac can also attack the enemies by clubbing them with his weapon or stomping on them. All weapons featured a secondary-fire mode. For example, the Plasma Cutter can be rotated 90 degrees for more effective dismemberment of vertical limbs (Such as legs on a normal [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] humanoid).<ref>{{cite web|first=Jeff|last=Haynes|url=http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/908/908187p1.html|title=Weapons of Dead Space|publisher=IGN|date=September 5, 2008|accessdate=December 18, 2011}}</ref> The player must scavenge for ammunition and items which are found throughout the ship or dropped by the Necromorphs when they are killed.

To resolve resource shortages, Concordance Extraction Corporation (CEC) was formed to use \"planet-cracker\" spaceships to destroy and mine planets for resources.\n\nTo resolve the energy shortage, a team led by Michael Altman was sent to investigate an alien artifact found in the [[Chicxulub crater]], dubbed \"The Marker.\" Made from an unknown, black alien material, the marker was found to emit a sourceless [[electromagnetic field]] (EMF), making it a potential source of infinite energy. After a series of mysterious events and Altman's leaking of events, EarthGov unsuccessfully attempted to cover-up its existence. Those who believed Altman's claims saw his murder as [[martyrdom]] and markers as a unifying [[religious symbol]], leading to the Church of Unitology's creation.\n\nWanting to safely harness marker energy, EarthGov [[reverse engineer]]ed Red Markers from [[bismuth]] on some of their space colonies, only to discover the EMF that markers emit cause the living to suffer [[psychoses]] and [[hallucinations]] while making the dead mutate and reanimate as \"necromorphs.\" Knowing Unitologists would seek out additional markers and cause necromorph spread, EarthGov immediately terminated all marker research and prohibited travel to their locations.\n\n===Synopsis===\nSet in the year 2508, the CEC dispatches the ''USG Kellion'' to investigate a distress signal from the ''USG Ishimura'', a planet cracker in the process of mining Aegis VII. CEC Engineer Isaac Clarke volunteers himself for the mission as his girlfriend, Nicole Brennan, is the Chief Medical Officer aboard the ship. After a guidance system malfunction crashes the ''Kellion'' into the ''Ishimura'' dock, the crew exits to find the ship seemingly abandoned, only to be attacked by grotesque monsters. Split up by the ambush, the only ''Kellion'' survivors are Clarke, Commander Zach Hammond, and Computer Specialist Kendra Daniels. Hammond notices that many of the ship's systems are failing, and both he and Daniels direct Clarke repairing the ship and summoning rescue.\n\nPiecing together events from recordings, Clarke learns that Aegis VII travel is a prohibited by EarthGov, and that the ''Ishimura'' was performing an illegal mining operation. When Unitologists on the crew discovered a Red Marker on the surface, additional followers filled the ''Ishimura'' crew in an attempt to return it to Earth. Soon after the marker's extraction to the ''Ishimura'', large numbers of both the ship and planet crew began to suffer [[homicide|homicidal]] [[psychoses]]. Conflicts began to form between moderates, radicals and non-Unitologists, culminating with a mutiny against the Unitologist captain that ended in his accidental death. A disease carried within the marker then began to activate, transforming and reanimating colonist corpses as grotesque monsters; in an attempt to retrieve a necromorph for study, the disease was inadvertently spread to the ''Ishimura''.\n\nWhile Hammond states that he is unaware what the marker is, Daniels confides to Clarke that she believes Hammond is lying. Though unable to ignore ship repair duties, Clarke soon makes contact with Nicole and is able to briefly rendezvous with her.  After repairing the critical systems, Clarke's team launches the second rescue beacon, attracting the military vessel ''USM Valor''. Rescuing an escape pod containing a jettisoned necromorph, the ''Valor'' is rapidly overrun and crashes into the ''Ishimura''. Boarding the ''Valor'', Hammond deduces from the equipment and logs that the ship was dispatched to kill any survivors and destroy the ''Ishimura''. Clarke and Hammond retrieve a singularity core from the ''Valor'' to repair an available shuttle, but Hammond is killed by an enhanced Necromorph in the process. \n\nDr. Kyne, one of the few survivors of the ''Ishimura'', reveals himself to Clarke. Kyne urges Clarke to return the marker to Aegis VII, believing it will restrain the \"[[Group mind (science fiction)|Hive Mind]]\", the creature controlling the Necromorphs. After assisting Clarke in loading the marker onto the shuttle, Daniels murders Kyne, revealing herself as an operative sent to retrieve the Red Marker. Daniels leaves on the shuttle without Clarke, but Nicole helps Clarke recall the shuttle remotely, prompting Daniels to flee to Aegis VII in an escape pod. Clarke takes the marker back to the colony and sets it in place, pacifying the Hive Mind and creating a \"dead space\" that makes all Necromorphs in the surrounding area dormant. This also causes an [[electromagnetic pulse]], disrupting the [[Artificial gravity (fiction)|gravity tethers]] holding the cracked planet together, and initiating Aegis VII's collapse.\n\nStuck in a decontamination chamber, Clarke watches as Daniels reappears and removes the Red Marker from the pedestal, attempting to take it to her shuttle. Taunting Clarke, Daniels shows him the full distress transmission from Nicole, which reveals that Brennan committed suicide by lethal injection at the end of the transmission; Clarke's interactions with Nicole were Red Marker [[hallucinations]], caused to influence him into returning it to the planet. Before the marker can be loaded onto the shuttle The Hive Mind reawakens, violently killing Daniels and forcing Clarke to neutralize it. Boarding a shuttle as the colony and the marker are destroyed, Clarke narrowly escapes as the planet implodes.

Harold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018 and was also the second-strongest tropical cyclone to ever affect [[Vanuatu]], behind [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vanuatu Reeling from Category 5 Harold, Now Steaming Toward Fiji |url=https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/vanuatu-reeling-from-category-5-harold-now-steaming-toward-fiji |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |publisher=Weather Underground |date=April 6, 2020}}</ref> The seventh named storm of the [[2019\u201320 Australian region cyclone season]], eighth named storm, and fourth severe tropical cyclone of the [[2019\u201320 South Pacific cyclone season]], Harold is [[list of the most intense tropical cyclones|the most intense tropical cyclone]] thus far [[Tropical cyclones in 2020|worldwide in 2020]].\n\nOn April&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2020, a tropical low formed centered between the [[Solomon Islands]] and the eastern coast of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Harold. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Harold 2020 track.png}}\nOn April 1, the Australian

The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone and named it Harold. The system moved into the [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Fiji Meteorological Service's]] area of responsibility on April&nbsp;2 and began to explosively intensify by April&nbsp;3, reaching Category 4 status by April&nbsp;4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale. It made landfall on [[Espiritu Santo]] on April&nbsp;6. Shortly afterwards, the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) upgraded it to a Category 5-equivalent cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale]]. It maintained this status for only six hours before being downgraded back to Category 4.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Harold 2020 track.png}}\nOn April 1, the Australian

Strict carnivory has always been considered the ancestral diet for theropods as a group, and a wider variety of diets was historically considered a characteristic exclusive to the avian theropods (birds).

Fossilized specimens of early theropods known to scientists in the 19th and early 20th centuries all possessed sharp teeth with serrated edges for cutting flesh, and some specimens even showed direct evidence of predatory behavior. For example, a ''[[Compsognathus longipes]]'' fossil was found with a [[lizard]] in its stomach, and a ''[[Velociraptor mongoliensis]]'' specimen was found locked in combat with a ''[[Protoceratops andrewsi]]'' (a type of [[ornithischian]] dinosaur).\n\nThe first confirmed non-carnivorous fossil theropods found were the [[therizinosaur]]s, originally known as segnosaurs. First thought to be [[Prosauropoda|prosauropods]], these enigmatic dinosaurs were later proven to be highly specialized, [[herbivore|herbivorous]] theropods. Therizinosaurs possessed large abdomens for processing plant food, and small heads with [[beak]]s and leaf-shaped teeth. Further study of [[maniraptora]]n theropods and their relationships showed that therizinosaurs were not the only early members of this group to abandon carnivory. Several other lineages of early maniraptors show adaptations for an [[omnivore|omnivorous]] diet, including seed-eating (some [[troodontidae|troodontids]]) and insect-eating (many [[Avialae|avialans]] and [[Alvarezsauridae|alvarezsaurs]]). [[Oviraptorosauria|Oviraptorosaurs]], [[Ornithomimosauria|ornithomimosaurs]] and advanced troodontids were likely omnivorous as well, and some early theropods (such as ''[[Masiakasaurus knopfleri]]'' and the [[Spinosauridae|spinosaurids]]) appear to have specialized in catching fish.<ref name=LC08>{{cite journal |last1=Longrich |first1=Nicholas R. |last2=Currie |first2=Philip J. |date=February 2009 |title=''Albertonykus borealis'', a new alvarezsaur (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Early Maastrichtian of Alberta, Canada: Implications for the systematics and ecology of the Alvarezsauridae |journal=Cretaceous Research |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages= 239\u2013252|doi=10.1016/j.cretres.2008.07.005}}</ref><ref name=\"holtzetal1998\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Holtz | first1 = T.R. | last2 = Jr | last3 = Brinkman | first3 = D.L. | last4 = Chandler | first4 = C.L. | year = 1998 | title = Dental morphometrics and a possibly omnivorous feeding habit for the theropod dinosaur ''Troodon'' | url = | journal = GAIA | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 159\u2013166}}</ref>\n\nDiet is largely deduced by the tooth [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hendrickx | first1 = C. | last2 = Mateus | first2 = O. | year = 2014 | title = Abelisauridae (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Late Jurassic of Portugal and dentition-based phylogeny as a contribution for the identification of isolated theropod teeth | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/db743a37ebdfd443113eac2a1d73ad682058af7b| journal = Zootaxa | volume = 3759 | issue = | pages = 1\u201374 | doi=10.11646/zootaxa.3759.1.1 | pmid=24869965}}</ref> tooth marks on bones of the prey, and gut contents.

During this period, theropods such as [[carnosaur]]s and [[tyrannosaurid]]s were thought to have walked with vertical femurs and spines in an upright, nearly erect posture, using their long, muscular tails as additional support in a kangaroo-like tripodal stance.<ref name=\"Hutchinson2006\"/> Beginning in the 1970s, biomechanical studies of extinct giant theropods cast doubt on this interpretation.

Theropod endocrania can also be reconstructed from preserved brain cases without damaging valuable specimens by using a computed tomography scan and [[3D reconstruction]] software. These finds are of evolutionary significance because they help document the emergence of the neurology of modern birds from that of earlier reptiles. An increase in the proportion of the brain occupied by the cerebrum seems to have occurred with the advent of the Coelurosauria and \"continued throughout the evolution of [[maniraptorans]] and early birds.\"<ref name=\"csaharicus-endo\">\"Abstract\", in Chure (2001).

This trait was, however, not universal: [[spinosaurids]] had well developed forelimbs, as did many [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]]. The relatively robust forelimbs of one genus, ''[[Xuanhanosaurus]]'', led [[Dong Zhiming]] to suggest that the animal might have been quadrupedal.<ref name=\"Dong1984\">{{cite journal |last1=Dong |first1=Z |title=A new theropod dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic of Sichuan Basin |journal=Vertebrata PalAsiatica |date=1984 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=213\u2013218}}</ref> However, this is no longer thought to be likely.<ref name=\"rauhut2003\"/>\n\nThe hands are also very different among the different groups. The most common form among non-avian theropods is an appendage consisting of three fingers; the digits I, II and III (or possibly II, III and IV),<ref>See [[Origin of birds#Digit homology|Origin of birds/Digit homology]].</ref> with sharp claws. Some basal theropods (e.g. ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'', ''[[Eoraptor]]'') had four digits, and also a reduced [[metacarpal]] V. [[Ceratosauria]]ns usually had four digits, while most [[Tetanurae|tetanurans]] had three.<ref>Some genera within [[Avetheropoda]], however, had four digits, see [[University of Maryland]] department of geology home page, [http://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/G104/10422ther.htm \"Theropoda I\" on ''Avetheropoda''], 14 July 2006.</ref>\n\nThe forelimbs' scope of use is also believed to have also been different among different families. The [[spinosaurids]] could have used their powerful forelimbs to hold fish. Some small [[maniraptora]]ns such as [[Scansoriopterygidae|scansoriopterygids]] are believed to have used their forelimbs to [[Arboreal locomotion|climb in trees]].<ref name=\"czerkas2002\" /> The wings of modern birds are used primarily for flight, though they are adapted for other purposes in certain groups.

In humans, pronation is achieved by motion of the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] relative to the [[ulna]] (the two bones of the forearm).

[[Coelurosauria|Coelurosaurs]] showed a shift in the use of the forearm, with greater flexibility at the shoulder allowing the arm to be raised towards the horizontal plane, and to even greater degrees in flying birds. However, in coelurosaurs, such as [[Ornithomimosauria|ornithomimosaurs]] and especially [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurs]], the hand itself had lost most flexibility, with highly inflexible fingers. Dromaeosaurs and other [[maniraptora]]ns also showed increased mobility at the wrist not seen in other theropods, thanks to the presence of a specialized half-moon shaped wrist bone (the semi-lunate carpal) that allowed the whole hand to fold backward towards the forearm in the manner of modern birds.<ref name=\"senter2005\"/>\n\n===Paleopathology===\n{{Main|Theropod paleopathology}}\nIn 2001, [[Ralph E. Molnar]] published a survey of [[pathologies]] in [[theropod]] dinosaur bone. He found pathological features in 21 [[genera]] from 10 families. Pathologies were found in theropods of all body size although they were less common in fossils of small theropods, although this may be an artifact of preservation. They are very widely represented throughout the different parts of theropod anatomy. The most common sites of preserved injury and disease in theropod dinosaurs are the [[ribs]] and [[tail vertebrae]]. Despite being abundant in ribs and vertebrae, injuries seem to be \"absent... or very rare\" on the bodies' primary weight supporting bones like the [[sacrum]], [[femur]], and [[tibia]]. The lack of preserved injuries in these bones suggests that they were selected by evolution for resistance to breakage. The least common sites of preserved injury are the [[cranium]] and forelimb, with injuries occurring in about equal frequency at each site. Most pathologies preserved in theropod fossils are the remains of injuries like fractures, pits, and punctures, often likely originating with bites. Some theropod paleopathologies seem to be evidence of [[infections]], which tended to be confined only to small regions of the animal's body. Evidence for congenital malformities have also been found in theropod remains. Such discoveries can provide information useful for understanding the evolutionary history of the processes of biological development. Unusual [[Synostosis|fusion]]s in cranial elements or [[asymmetries]] in the same are probably evidence that one is examining the fossils of an extremely old individual rather than a diseased one.<ref name=\"molnar-pathology\">Molnar, R.

The study described and analyzed four complete natural molds of theropod foot prints that are now stored at the Huaxia Dinosaur Tracks Research and Development Center (HDT). These dinosaur footprints were in fact claw marks, which suggest that this theropod was swimming near the surface of a river and just the tips of its toes and claws could touch the bottom.

[[Megalosauridae]] were primarily Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous predators, and their [[Spinosauridae|spinosaurid]] relatives' remains are mostly from Early and Middle Cretaceous rocks. Avetheropoda, as their name indicates, were more closely related to birds and are again divided into the [[Allosauroidea]] (the diverse [[Carcharodontosauria|carcharodontosaurs]]) and the [[Coelurosauria]] (a very large and diverse dinosaur group including the birds).\n\nThus, during the late Jurassic, there were no fewer than four distinct lineages of theropods\u2014ceratosaurs, megalosaurs, allosaurs, and coelurosaurs\u2014preying on the abundance of small and large herbivorous dinosaurs.

This basic division has survived into modern paleontology, with the exception of, again, the Prosauropoda, which Romer included as an [[Order (biology)|infraorder]] of theropods.

This dichotomy was upset by the discovery of ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' in 1969, neither of which could be classified easily as \"carnosaurs\" or \"coelurosaurs\". In light of these and other discoveries, by the late 1970s [[Rinchen Barsbold]] had created a new series of theropod infraorders: Coelurosauria, [[Deinonychosauria]], [[Oviraptorosauria]], Carnosauria, [[Ornithomimosauria]], and [[Deinocheirosauria]].<ref name=\"rauhut2003\"/>\n\nWith the advent of [[cladistics]] and [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] in the 1980s, and their development in the 1990s and 2000s, a clearer picture of theropod relationships began to emerge.

As more information about the link between dinosaurs and birds came to light, the more bird-like theropods were grouped in the clade [[Maniraptora]] (also named by Gauthier in 1986). These new developments also came with a recognition among most scientists that birds arose directly from maniraptoran theropods and, on the abandonment of ranks in cladistic classification, with the re-evaluation of birds as a subset of theropod dinosaurs that survived the Mesozoic extinctions and lived into the present.<ref name=\"rauhut2003\"/>\n\n===Major groups===\n[[File:Ceratosaurus mounted.jpg|thumb|''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', a ceratosaurid]]\n[[File:Irritator challengeri mount 01.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Irritator]]'', a spinosaurid]]\n[[File:Mapusaurus skulls.jpg|thumb|''[[Mapusaurus]]'', a carcharodontosaurid]]\n[[File:MicroraptorGui-PaleozoologicalMuseumOfChina-May23-08.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Microraptor]]'', a dromaeosaurid]]\n[[File:Passer domesticus male (15).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Passer domesticus]]'', an avian, and the world's most widespread extant wild theropod.<ref name=\"anderson2006\">Anderson, Ted R.

Strict carnivory has always been considered the ancestral diet for theropods as a group, and a wider variety of diets was historically considered a characteristic exclusive to the avian theropods (birds).

Fossilized specimens of early theropods known to scientists in the 19th and early 20th centuries all possessed sharp teeth with serrated edges for cutting flesh, and some specimens even showed direct evidence of predatory behavior. For example, a ''[[Compsognathus longipes]]'' fossil was found with a [[lizard]] in its stomach, and a ''[[Velociraptor mongoliensis]]'' specimen was found locked in combat with a ''[[Protoceratops andrewsi]]'' (a type of [[ornithischian]] dinosaur).\n\nThe first confirmed non-carnivorous fossil theropods found were the [[therizinosaur]]s, originally known as segnosaurs. First thought to be [[Prosauropoda|prosauropods]], these enigmatic dinosaurs were later proven to be highly specialized, [[herbivore|herbivorous]] theropods. Therizinosaurs possessed large abdomens for processing plant food, and small heads with [[beak]]s and leaf-shaped teeth. Further study of [[maniraptora]]n theropods and their relationships showed that therizinosaurs were not the only early members of this group to abandon carnivory. Several other lineages of early maniraptors show adaptations for an [[omnivore|omnivorous]] diet, including seed-eating (some [[troodontidae|troodontids]]) and insect-eating (many [[Avialae|avialans]] and [[Alvarezsauridae|alvarezsaurs]]). [[Oviraptorosauria|Oviraptorosaurs]], [[Ornithomimosauria|ornithomimosaurs]] and advanced troodontids were likely omnivorous as well, and some early theropods (such as ''[[Masiakasaurus knopfleri]]'' and the [[Spinosauridae|spinosaurids]]) appear to have specialized in catching fish.<ref name=LC08>{{cite journal |last1=Longrich |first1=Nicholas R. |last2=Currie |first2=Philip J. |date=February 2009 |title=''Albertonykus borealis'', a new alvarezsaur (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Early Maastrichtian of Alberta, Canada: Implications for the systematics and ecology of the Alvarezsauridae |journal=Cretaceous Research |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages= 239\u2013252|doi=10.1016/j.cretres.2008.07.005}}</ref><ref name=\"holtzetal1998\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Holtz | first1 = T.R. | last2 = Jr | last3 = Brinkman | first3 = D.L. | last4 = Chandler | first4 = C.L. | year = 1998 | title = Dental morphometrics and a possibly omnivorous feeding habit for the theropod dinosaur ''Troodon'' | url = | journal = GAIA | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 159\u2013166}}</ref>\n\nDiet is largely deduced by the tooth [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hendrickx | first1 = C. | last2 = Mateus | first2 = O. | year = 2014 | title = Abelisauridae (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Late Jurassic of Portugal and dentition-based phylogeny as a contribution for the identification of isolated theropod teeth | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/db743a37ebdfd443113eac2a1d73ad682058af7b| journal = Zootaxa | volume = 3759 | issue = | pages = 1\u201374 | doi=10.11646/zootaxa.3759.1.1 | pmid=24869965}}</ref> tooth marks on bones of the prey, and gut contents.

During this period, theropods such as [[carnosaur]]s and [[tyrannosaurid]]s were thought to have walked with vertical femurs and spines in an upright, nearly erect posture, using their long, muscular tails as additional support in a kangaroo-like tripodal stance.<ref name=\"Hutchinson2006\"/> Beginning in the 1970s, biomechanical studies of extinct giant theropods cast doubt on this interpretation. Studies of limb bone articulation and the relative absence of trackway evidence for tail dragging suggested that, when walking, the giant, long-tailed theropods would have adopted a more horizontal posture with the tail held parallel to the ground.<ref name=\"Hutchinson2006\"/><ref name=\"newman1970\">{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=BH|year=1970|title=Stance and gait in the flesh-eating ''Tyrannosaurus''|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume=2|pages=119\u2013123|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1970.tb01707.x|issue=2|url=https://zenodo.org/record/3674749}}</ref> However, the orientation of the legs in these species while walking remains controversial.

Theropod endocrania can also be reconstructed from preserved brain cases without damaging valuable specimens by using a computed tomography scan and [[3D reconstruction]] software. These finds are of evolutionary significance because they help document the emergence of the neurology of modern birds from that of earlier reptiles. An increase in the proportion of the brain occupied by the cerebrum seems to have occurred with the advent of the Coelurosauria and \"continued throughout the evolution of [[maniraptorans]] and early birds.\"<ref name=\"csaharicus-endo\">\"Abstract\", in Chure (2001).

This trait was, however, not universal: [[spinosaurids]] had well developed forelimbs, as did many [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]]. The relatively robust forelimbs of one genus, ''[[Xuanhanosaurus]]'', led [[Dong Zhiming]] to suggest that the animal might have been quadrupedal.<ref name=\"Dong1984\">{{cite journal |last1=Dong |first1=Z |title=A new theropod dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic of Sichuan Basin |journal=Vertebrata PalAsiatica |date=1984 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=213\u2013218}}</ref> However, this is no longer thought to be likely.<ref name=\"rauhut2003\"/>\n\nThe hands are also very different among the different groups. The most common form among non-avian theropods is an appendage consisting of three fingers; the digits I, II and III (or possibly II, III and IV),<ref>See [[Origin of birds#Digit homology|Origin of birds/Digit homology]].</ref> with sharp claws. Some basal theropods (e.g. ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'', ''[[Eoraptor]]'') had four digits, and also a reduced [[metacarpal]] V. [[Ceratosauria]]ns usually had four digits, while most [[Tetanurae|tetanurans]] had three.<ref>Some genera within [[Avetheropoda]], however, had four digits, see [[University of Maryland]] department of geology home page, [http://www.geol.umd.edu/~tholtz/G104/10422ther.htm \"Theropoda I\" on ''Avetheropoda''], 14 July 2006.</ref>\n\nThe forelimbs' scope of use is also believed to have also been different among different families. The [[spinosaurids]] could have used their powerful forelimbs to hold fish. Some small [[maniraptora]]ns such as [[Scansoriopterygidae|scansoriopterygids]] are believed to have used their forelimbs to [[Arboreal locomotion|climb in trees]].<ref name=\"czerkas2002\" /> The wings of modern birds are used primarily for flight, though they are adapted for other purposes in certain groups.

In humans, pronation is achieved by motion of the [[Radius (bone)|radius]] relative to the [[ulna]] (the two bones of the forearm). In saurischian dinosaurs, however, the end of the radius near the elbow was actually locked into a groove of the ulna, preventing any movement.

This was also true of more basal theropods, such as [[Herrerasauria|herrerasaurs]] and [[Dilophosauridae|dilophosaurs]]. [[Coelurosauria|Coelurosaurs]] showed a shift in the use of the forearm, with greater flexibility at the shoulder allowing the arm to be raised towards the horizontal plane, and to even greater degrees in flying birds. However, in coelurosaurs, such as [[Ornithomimosauria|ornithomimosaurs]] and especially [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurs]], the hand itself had lost most flexibility, with highly inflexible fingers. Dromaeosaurs and other [[maniraptora]]ns also showed increased mobility at the wrist not seen in other theropods, thanks to the presence of a specialized half-moon shaped wrist bone (the semi-lunate carpal) that allowed the whole hand to fold backward towards the forearm in the manner of modern birds.<ref name=\"senter2005\"/>\n\n===Paleopathology===\n{{Main|Theropod paleopathology}}\nIn 2001, [[Ralph E. Molnar]] published a survey of [[pathologies]] in [[theropod]] dinosaur bone. He found pathological features in 21 [[genera]] from 10 families. Pathologies were found in theropods of all body size although they were less common in fossils of small theropods, although this may be an artifact of preservation. They are very widely represented throughout the different parts of theropod anatomy. The most common sites of preserved injury and disease in theropod dinosaurs are the [[ribs]] and [[tail vertebrae]]. Despite being abundant in ribs and vertebrae, injuries seem to be \"absent... or very rare\" on the bodies' primary weight supporting bones like the [[sacrum]], [[femur]], and [[tibia]]. The lack of preserved injuries in these bones suggests that they were selected by evolution for resistance to breakage. The least common sites of preserved injury are the [[cranium]] and forelimb, with injuries occurring in about equal frequency at each site. Most pathologies preserved in theropod fossils are the remains of injuries like fractures, pits, and punctures, often likely originating with bites. Some theropod paleopathologies seem to be evidence of [[infections]], which tended to be confined only to small regions of the animal's body. Evidence for congenital malformities have also been found in theropod remains. Such discoveries can provide information useful for understanding the evolutionary history of the processes of biological development. Unusual [[Synostosis|fusion]]s in cranial elements or [[asymmetries]] in the same are probably evidence that one is examining the fossils of an extremely old individual rather than a diseased one.<ref name=\"molnar-pathology\">Molnar, R.

The study described and analyzed four complete natural molds of theropod foot prints that are now stored at the Huaxia Dinosaur Tracks Research and Development Center (HDT). These dinosaur footprints were in fact claw marks, which suggest that this theropod was swimming near the surface of a river and just the tips of its toes and claws could touch the bottom. The tracks indicate a coordinated, left-right, left-right progression, which supports the proposition that theropods were well-coordinated swimmers.<ref name=swimming/>\n\n==Evolutionary history==\n[[File:Herrerasaurusskeleton.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Full skeleton of an early carnivorous dinosaur, displayed in a glass case in a museum|Possible early forms ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'' (large) and ''[[Eoraptor]]'' (small)]]\nDuring the late [[Triassic]], a number of primitive proto-theropod and theropod dinosaurs existed and evolved alongside each other.\n\nThe earliest and most primitive of the theropod dinosaurs were the carnivorous ''[[Eodromaeus]]'' and the [[Herrerasauridae|herrerasaurids]] of [[Argentina]] (as well as, possibly, the omnivorous ''[[Eoraptor]]'').

[[Megalosauridae]] were primarily Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous predators, and their [[Spinosauridae|spinosaurid]] relatives' remains are mostly from Early and Middle Cretaceous rocks. Avetheropoda, as their name indicates, were more closely related to birds and are again divided into the [[Allosauroidea]] (the diverse [[Carcharodontosauria|carcharodontosaurs]]) and the [[Coelurosauria]] (a very large and diverse dinosaur group including the birds).\n\nThus, during the late Jurassic, there were no fewer than four distinct lineages of theropods\u2014ceratosaurs, megalosaurs, allosaurs, and coelurosaurs\u2014preying on the abundance of small and large herbivorous dinosaurs.

In light of these and other discoveries, by the late 1970s [[Rinchen Barsbold]] had created a new series of theropod infraorders: Coelurosauria, [[Deinonychosauria]], [[Oviraptorosauria]], Carnosauria, [[Ornithomimosauria]], and [[Deinocheirosauria]].<ref name=\"rauhut2003\"/>\n\nWith the advent of [[cladistics]] and [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] in the 1980s, and their development in the 1990s and 2000s, a clearer picture of theropod relationships began to emerge.

As more information about the link between dinosaurs and birds came to light, the more bird-like theropods were grouped in the clade [[Maniraptora]] (also named by Gauthier in 1986). These new developments also came with a recognition among most scientists that birds arose directly from maniraptoran theropods and, on the abandonment of ranks in cladistic classification, with the re-evaluation of birds as a subset of theropod dinosaurs that survived the Mesozoic extinctions and lived into the present.<ref name=\"rauhut2003\"/>\n\n===Major groups===\n[[File:Ceratosaurus mounted.jpg|thumb|''[[Ceratosaurus]]'', a ceratosaurid]]\n[[File:Irritator challengeri mount 01.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Irritator]]'', a spinosaurid]]\n[[File:Mapusaurus skulls.jpg|thumb|''[[Mapusaurus]]'', a carcharodontosaurid]]\n[[File:MicroraptorGui-PaleozoologicalMuseumOfChina-May23-08.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Microraptor]]'', a dromaeosaurid]]\n[[File:Passer domesticus male (15).jpg|thumb|right|''[[Passer domesticus]]'', an avian, and the world's most widespread extant wild theropod.<ref name=\"anderson2006\">Anderson, Ted R.

Baron, [[David B. Norman|David Norman]] and Paul M. Barrett (2017) published in the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] suggested that Theropoda is actually more closely related to [[Ornithischia]], to which it formed the [[sister group]] within the clade [[Ornithoscelida]]. This new hypothesis also recovered [[Herrerasauridae]] as the sister group to [[Sauropodomorpha]] in the redefined [[Saurischia]] and suggested that the hypercarnivore morphologies that are observed in specimens of theropods and herrerasaurids were acquired [[Convergent evolution|convergently]].<ref name=\"Ornithoscelida\">{{cite journal | last1 = Baron | first1 = M.G. | last2 = Norman | first2 = D.B. | last3 = Barrett | first3 = P.M. | year = 2017 | title = A new hypothesis of dinosaur relationships and early dinosaur evolution | url = http://eprints.esc.cam.ac.uk/3857/2/Supplementary%20Information%20_%20MGB%20_%20DBN%20_%20PMB.pdf| journal = Nature | volume = 543 | issue = 7646| pages = 501\u2013506 | doi = 10.1038/nature21700 | pmid = 28332513}}</ref><ref>https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/new-study-shakes-the-roots-of-the-dinosaur-family-tree</ref> However, this phylogeny remains controversial and additional work is being done to clarify these relationships. {{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Dinosaurs|Birds|Amphibians and Reptiles}}\n* [[Bird]]\n** [[Origin of birds]]\n* [[Marginocephalian]]\n* [[Ornithopod]]\n* [[Sauropod]]\n* [[Thyreophoran]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Theropoda}}\n\n{{Ornithodira|D.|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Theropoda|B.|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Birds}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q188438}}\n\n[[Category:Theropods| ]]\n[[Category:Carnian first appearances]]\n[[Category:Extant Late Triassic first appearances]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Othniel Charles Marsh]]\n", "name_user": "JHunterJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: 4 million \u2192 4\u00a0million (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theropoda"}
