The piles, however, still seem in place. A capital has rotated, perhaps dragged by the deck that passed over it, but the bulk of the pile, the one in the riverbed is intact. The piles are very deep, I doubt that the explanations for this collapse lie in the fact that you are in the river bed.

The ERR were especially active in Paris in looting art stolen from famous Jewish families such as the [[Rothschilds]] and that of [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]]. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] used the ERR to collect art for his own personal gratification.<ref>L\u00f6hr, Hanns Christian (2018): '' Kunst als Waffe \u2013 Der Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg, Ideologie und Kunstraub im \u201eDritten Reich\u201c'', Gebr.

[[Alfred Meyer]] served as his deputy and represented him at the [[Wannsee Conference]]. Another official of the Ministry, [[Georg Leibbrandt]], also attended the conference, at Rosenberg's request.\n\nRosenberg had presented Hitler with his plan for the organization of the conquered Eastern territories, suggesting the establishment of new administrative districts, to replace the previously [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-controlled territories with new [[Reichskommissar]]iats. These would be:\n\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]]'' ([[Baltic countries]] and [[Belarus]]),\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]]'' ([[Ukraine]] and nearest territories),\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Kaukasus|Kaukasus]]'' ([[Caucasus]] area),\n* ''[[Reichskommissariat Moskau|Moskau]]'' (Moscow metropolitan area and the rest of nearest Russian European areas)\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-067-10, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Alfred Rosenberg in 1939]]\n[[File:Alfred Rosenberg's office from 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Former Nazi Ministry for Occupied Eastern Territories, Berlin (2014)]]\n\nAlthough Rosenberg regarded all the Soviet peoples as subhumans for their communist beliefs,<ref>[[David Irving|Irving, David]] (1996) ''Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich'', London: Focal Point. p. 769.  {{ISBN|1872197132}}</ref> such suggestions were intended to encourage certain non-[[Russia]]n nationalism and to promote German interests for the benefit of future [[Aryan race|Aryan]] generations, in accord with geopolitical \"[[Lebensraum]] im Osten\" plans. They would provide a buffer against Soviet expansion in preparation for the total eradication of Communism and [[Bolshevism]] by decisive pre-emptive military action.\n\nFollowing these plans, when [[Wehrmacht]] forces invaded Soviet-controlled territory, they immediately implemented the first of the proposed Reichskommissariats of [[Ostland]] and [[Ukraine]], under the leadership of [[Hinrich Lohse]] and [[Erich Koch]], respectively. The organization of these administrative territories led to conflict between Rosenberg and the [[SS]] over the treatment of [[Slavs]] under German occupation. As Nazi Germany's chief racial theorist, Rosenberg considered Slavs, though lesser than Germans, to be Aryan. Rosenberg often complained to Hitler and Himmler about the treatment of non-Jewish occupied peoples.<ref name = \"kev\">Kevin P.

German propaganda efforts designed to win over Russian opinion were, at best, patchy and inconsistent. Alfred Rosenberg was one of the few in the Nazi hierarchy who advocated a policy designed to encourage [[anti-Communist]] opinion among the population of the occupied territories. His interest here was mainly in the non-Russian areas such as Ukraine and the Baltic States; however, supporters of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] were somewhat able to win him over.<ref>[http://www.feldgrau.com/rvol.html Russian Volunteers in the Wehrmacht]</ref>\n\nAmongst other things, Rosenberg issued a series of posters announcing the end of the Soviet collective farms (''[[kolkhoz]]''). He also issued an Agrarian Law in February 1942, annulling all Soviet legislation on farming and restoring family farms for those willing to collaborate with the occupiers. But decollectivisation conflicted with the wider demands of wartime food production, and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] demanded that the collective farms be retained, save for a change of name. Hitler himself denounced the redistribution of land as \"stupid\".<ref>Leonid Grenkevich, ''The Soviet Partisan Movement, 1941\u20131945: A Critical Historiographical Analysis'', Routledge, New York, 1999, pp. 169\u2013171.</ref>\n\nThere were numerous German armed forces (''[[Wehrmacht]]'') posters asking for assistance in the ''Bandenkrieg,'' the war against the [[Soviet partisans]], though, once again, German policy had the effect of adding to their problems. Posters for \"volunteer\" labour, with inscriptions like \"Come work with us to shorten the war\", hid the appalling realities faced by [[OST-Arbeiter|Russian workers in Germany]]. Many people joined the partisans rather than risk being sent to an unknown fate in the west.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nAnother of Rosenberg's initiatives, the \"Free Caucasus\" campaign, was rather more successful, attracting various nationalities into the so-called Eastern Legion (''[[Ostlegionen]]''), though in the end this made little difference in the outcome of the war on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\n==Trial and execution==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Alfred Jodl, Hans Frank, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg\n| width1    = 187\n| caption1  = Rosenberg (right) at the Nuremberg trials, with [[Hans Frank]] (centre) and [[Alfred Jodl]]\n| image2    = Defendants Nuremberg-War-Crimes-Tribunal 1945-11-27.jpg\n| width2    = 255\n| caption2  = 1946 Nuremberg courtroom: Rosenberg (front row, left)\n}}\n[[File:Dead alfredrosenberg.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rosenberg after his hanging]]\nRosenberg was captured by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops at the end of the war in [[Flensburg]]-[[M\u00fcrwik]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article99007254 |title=Allies Capture Nazi Pagan Philosopher. |newspaper=[[The Northern Star|Northern Star (Lismore, NSW : 1876\u20131954)]] |location=Lismore, NSW |date=22 May 1945 |accessdate=30 September 2013 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> He was tried at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and found guilty of all four counts: conspiracy to commit [[crimes against peace]]; planning, initiating and waging [[wars of aggression]]; [[war crimes]]; and [[crimes against humanity]].

He was perceived as lacking the charisma and political skills of the other Nazi leaders, and was somewhat isolated. In some of his speeches Hitler appeared to be close to Rosenberg's views, rejecting traditional Christianity as a religion based on Jewish culture, preferring an ethnically and culturally pure \"Race\" whose destiny was supposed to be assigned to the German people by \"Providence\". In others, he adhered to the Nazi Party line, which advocated a \"positive Christianity\".\n\nAfter Hitler's assumption of power he moved to reassure the Protestant and Catholic churches that the party was not intending to reinstitute [[Germanic paganism]]. He placed himself in the position of being the man to save Positive Christianity from utter destruction at the hands of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|atheistic antitheist Communist]]s of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9SBndd4Jc0QC|title=The 'Hitler Myth': Image and Reality in the Third Reich|author=Kershaw, Ian|year= 2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n|page= 109|isbn= 0-19-280206-2|oclc = 47063365\n|quote = Hitler's evident ability to simulate, even to potentially critical Church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity was crucial to the mediation of such an image to the church-going public by influential members of both major denominations.

Hitler remarked privately in later years that his choice of Rosenberg, whom he regarded as weak and lazy, was strategic; Hitler did not want the temporary leader of the Nazis to become too popular or hungry for power, because a person with either of those two qualities might not want to cede the party leadership after Hitler's release. However, at the time of the appointment Hitler had no reason to believe that he would soon be released, and Rosenberg had not appeared weak, so this may have been Hitler reading back into history his dissatisfaction with Rosenberg for the job he did.<ref>Cecil, pp.42\u20133</ref>\n\nIn 1929 Rosenberg founded the [[Militant League for German Culture]]. He later formed the \"[[Institute for Study of the Jewish Question|Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question]],\" dedicated to identifying and attacking Jewish influence in German culture and to recording the history of Judaism from a radical nationalist perspective. He became a [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] Deputy in 1930 and published his book on [[Master race|racial theory]] ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'' (''Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts'') which deals with key issues in the National Socialist ideology, such as the \"Jewish question.\" Rosenberg intended his book as a sequel to [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]]'s above-cited book. {{Anchor|Pseudointellectualism_and_pseudoreligion}} Despite selling more than a million copies by 1945, its influence within Nazism remains doubtful.

The organization of these administrative territories led to conflict between Rosenberg and the [[SS]] over the treatment of [[Slavs]] under German occupation.

German propaganda efforts designed to win over Russian opinion were, at best, patchy and inconsistent. Alfred Rosenberg was one of the few in the Nazi hierarchy who advocated a policy designed to encourage [[anti-Communist]] opinion among the population of the occupied territories. His interest here was mainly in the non-Russian areas such as Ukraine and the Baltic States; however, supporters of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] were somewhat able to win him over.<ref>[http://www.feldgrau.com/rvol.html Russian Volunteers in the Wehrmacht]</ref>\n\nAmongst other things, Rosenberg issued a series of posters announcing the end of the Soviet collective farms (''[[kolkhoz]]''). He also issued an Agrarian Law in February 1942, annulling all Soviet legislation on farming and restoring family farms for those willing to collaborate with the occupiers. But decollectivisation conflicted with the wider demands of wartime food production, and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] demanded that the collective farms be retained, save for a change of name.

He was perceived as lacking the charisma and political skills of the other Nazi leaders, and was somewhat isolated. In some of his speeches Hitler appeared to be close to Rosenberg's views, rejecting traditional Christianity as a religion based on Jewish culture, preferring an ethnically and culturally pure \"Race\" whose destiny was supposed to be assigned to the German people by \"Providence\". In others, he adhered to the Nazi Party line, which advocated a \"positive Christianity\".\n\nAfter Hitler's assumption of power he moved to reassure the Protestant and Catholic churches that the party was not intending to reinstitute [[Germanic paganism]]. He placed himself in the position of being the man to save Positive Christianity from utter destruction at the hands of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|atheistic antitheist Communist]]s of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9SBndd4Jc0QC|title=The 'Hitler Myth': Image and Reality in the Third Reich|author=Kershaw, Ian|year= 2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n|page= 109|isbn= 0-19-280206-2|oclc = 47063365\n|quote = Hitler's evident ability to simulate, even to potentially critical Church leaders, an image of a leader keen to uphold and protect Christianity was crucial to the mediation of such an image to the church-going public by influential members of both major denominations.
