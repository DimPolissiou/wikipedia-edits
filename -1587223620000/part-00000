Avaricum, situated in the lands of the [[Bituriges]], was the largest and best-fortified town within their territory, situated on very fertile lands. The terrain favored the ''oppidum'', as it was flanked by a river and marshland, with only a single narrow entrance.\nBy the time of the Roman conquest in 52 BC the city according to [[Julius Caesar]] had a population of 40,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=28C63w4vKD8C&pg=PA165 |title=Lords of Battle: The World of the Celtic Warrior - Stephen Allen - Google B\u0159ger |publisher=Books.google.dk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==Siege of Avaricum==\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|image=\n|caption=\n|conflict=Siege of Avaricum\n|partof=the [[Gallic Wars]]\n|date=52 BC\n|place=[[Gaul]]\n|result=[[Roman Republic|Roman]] victory\n|combatant1=[[Roman Republic]]\n|combatant2=[[Bituriges]]<br />[[Arverni]]\n|commander1=[[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]]\n|commander2=[[Vercingetorix]]\n|strength1=\n|strength2=\n|casualties1=\n|casualties2=\n}}\n{{Campaignbox Gallic Wars}}\n\n[[Julius Caesar]], after a series of victories at [[Vellaunodunum]], [[Genabum]], and [[Noviodunum Biturigum]], had arrived at Avaricum in the winter of 52 BC, intent on denying its grain and steel to the rebellious Gauls. [[Vercingetorix]], aware that he had already been bested three times, decided to change strategy. Calling together a council of the tribes in rebellion against Rome, he convinced them to adopt the [[Fabian strategy]] of not to offer combat with Caesar's forces but to deny them supplies by the [[scorched earth]] tactic. All the towns within range of Caesar's foraging parties were destroyed, the land stripped bare and all grain removed or burned. However, Avaricum was spared that fate since the Bituriges argued the town was impossible to take and begged for their largest city not to be destroyed. Vercingetorix agreed to make the town an exception.<ref name=gaul>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/siege_avaricum.html |title=Siege of Avaricum, 52 BC |publisher=Historyofwar.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26}}</ref>\n\nHowever, upon Caesar's appearance at the gates of Avaricum, Vercingetorix moved his army to a distance 15 miles outside town, perfectly situated so that Caesar could not leave without a battle nor could he forage at will. To add to his woes, Caesar's allies, the [[Aedui]] and the [[Boii]], were unable to supply him, the former because they had quietly joined Vercingetorix in his rebellion, the latter because they simply did not have any food to spare. The shortage of grain was so acute that the men ate only meat, which was rare for a Roman field army. Caesar personally made the rounds among his men and told them that if the scarcity of food was too much, he would lift the siege and withdraw. His soldiers protested and refused to end a siege in disgrace when they still had to avenge the innocent Romans murdered a year earlier by the Gauls in [[Genabum]].\n\n[[Image:Avaricum westpoint july 2006.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Model of the siege of Avaricum.]]\nContented, Caesar designed and began to engineer an impressive siege apparatus. Starting from high ground, he built a siege terrace of sorts. Two flanking walls were made, along with two towers to be advanced fully made. Another wall was built between the flanking walls to connect them and open the front for the battle.\n\nAs construction on Caesar's siege terrace continued, Vercingetorix moved his cavalry into a camp closer to Caesar's, intent on ambushing Caesar's foraging troops. Caesar discovered that and countered by marching in the dead of night and threatening Vercingetorix's main camp. Vercingetorix then drew back to his main camp, rushing to its aid. Caesar withdrew since his aim had been accomplished.\n\nAfter 25 grueling days of construction and contending with Gallic raids and attempts to set the whole siege terrace on fire, Caesar's apparatus was completed. Caesar ordered the towers advanced; much to his good fortune, a fierce storm struck, driving the Gallic sentries to seek cover, rather than stand watch. Taking advantage of the lack of discipline, Caesar stealthily moved his soldiers into the towers and the wall, and launched a brutal strike. The walls fell quickly, and the surviving Gauls retreated to the town centre, formed a wedge formation and were determined to fight to the end. However, the Roman legionaries failed to descend from the walls. Instead, they simply stood at their ease and watched the Gauls.

Avaricum, situated in the lands of the [[Bituriges]], was the largest and best-fortified town within their territory, situated on very fertile lands. The terrain favored the ''oppidum'', as it was flanked by a river and marshland, with only a single narrow entrance.\nBy the time of the Roman conquest in 52 BC the city according to [[Julius Caesar]] had a population of 40,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=28C63w4vKD8C&pg=PA165 |title=Lords of Battle: The World of the Celtic Warrior - Stephen Allen - Google B\u0159ger |publisher=Books.google.dk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26}}</ref>\n\n==Siege of Avaricum==\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|image=\n|caption=\n|conflict=Siege of Avaricum\n|partof=the [[Gallic Wars]]\n|date=52 BC\n|place=[[Gaul]]\n|result=[[Roman Republic|Roman]] victory\n|combatant1=[[Roman Republic]]\n|combatant2=[[Bituriges]]<br />[[Arverni]]\n|commander1=[[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]]\n|commander2=[[Vercingetorix]]\n|strength1=\n|strength2=\n|casualties1=\n|casualties2=\n}}\n{{Campaignbox Gallic Wars}}\n\n[[Julius Caesar]], after a series of victories at [[Vellaunodunum]], [[Genabum]], and [[Noviodunum Biturigum]], had arrived at Avaricum in the winter of 52 BC, intent on denying its grain and steel to the rebellious Gauls. [[Vercingetorix]], aware that he had already been bested three times, decided to change strategy. Calling together a council of the tribes in rebellion against Rome, he convinced them to adopt the [[Fabian strategy]] of not to offer combat with Caesar's forces but to deny them supplies by the [[scorched earth]] tactic. All the towns within range of Caesar's foraging parties were destroyed, the land stripped bare and all grain removed or burned. However, Avaricum was spared that fate since the Bituriges argued the town was impossible to take and begged for their largest city not to be destroyed. Vercingetorix agreed to make the town an exception.<ref name=gaul>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/siege_avaricum.html |title=Siege of Avaricum, 52 BC |publisher=Historyofwar.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-26}}</ref>\n\nHowever, upon Caesar's appearance at the gates of Avaricum, Vercingetorix moved his army to a distance 15 miles outside town, perfectly situated so that Caesar could not leave without a battle or could he forage at will. To add to his woes, Caesar's allies, the [[Aedui]] and the [[Boii]], were unable to supply him, the former because they had quietly joined Vercingetorix in his rebellion, the latter because they simply did not have any food to spare. The shortage of grain was so acute that the men ate only meat, which was rare for a Roman field army. Caesar personally made the rounds among his men and told them that if the scarcity of food was too much, he would lift the siege and withdraw. His soldiers protested and refused to end a siege in disgrace when they still had to avenge the innocent Romans murdered a year earlier by the Gauls in [[Genabum]].\n\n[[Image:Avaricum westpoint july 2006.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Model of the siege of Avaricum.]]\nContented, Caesar designed and began to engineer an impressive siege apparatus. Starting from high ground, he built a siege terrace of sorts. Two flanking walls were made, along with two towers to be advanced fully made. Another wall was built between the flanking walls to connect them and open the front for the battle.\n\nAs construction on Caesar's siege terrace continued, Vercingetorix moved his cavalry into a camp closer to Caesar's, intent on ambushing Caesar's foraging troops. Caesar discovered that and countered by marching in the dead of night and threatening Vercingetorix's main camp. Vercingetorix then drew back to his main camp, rushing to its aid. Caesar withdrew since his aim had been accomplished.\n\nAfter 25 grueling days of construction and contending with Gallic raids and attempts to set the whole siege terrace on fire, Caesar's apparatus was completed. Caesar ordered the towers advanced; much to his good fortune, a fierce storm struck, driving the Gallic sentries to seek cover, rather than stand watch. Taking advantage of the lack of discipline, Caesar stealthily moved his soldiers into the towers and the wall, and launched a brutal strike. The walls fell quickly, and the surviving Gauls retreated to the town centre, formed a wedge formation and were determined to fight to the end. However, the Roman legionaries failed to descend from the walls. Instead, they simply stood at their ease and watched the Gauls. Panic struck the Gallic defenders, all of whom fled for wherever they thought there was an avenue of escape.\n\nHowever, Caesar's [[Roman legion|legions]] were in no mood to spare any of the 40,000 Gauls within Avaricum, especially after 25 days of short rations and great frustration. Only 800 managed to escape the [[massacre]] that followed.
