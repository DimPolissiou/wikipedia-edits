In order to establish a post office, Griffin completed a [[US Postal Service]] application that required the signature of the local [[Justice of the Peace]]. While reviewing the application, Justice of the Peace Lambert P. Darland suggested the name \"Plainville\". Griffin operated the Plainville post office and a small store from his [[sod house]], the first structure in what would become the city of Plainville.<ref name=\"Dougherty, Harriet 1961, pp. 12-13\">Dougherty, Harriet. \"History of Plainville City and Township\", Plainville Times, September 21, 1961, pp. 12-13.</ref>\n\nIn 1888, Plainville filed for [[municipal incorporation|incorporation]] with 500 residents. Dan E. Miller was elected the first mayor. The first city council consisted of Dr. Volney M. Gray, Murray C. Knox, John Mullin, George Brooks and David E. Mickey.<ref>\"PLAINVILLE'S PROGRESS\", The Plainville Times, July 26, 1888, pp. 1, 4.</ref>\n\n[[Union Pacific Railroad]] established an east\u2013west route through Plainville in August 1888. The train tracks ran parallel to Mill Street, approximately one block to the north. The [[Train station|Train Depot]] was located on the northwest corner of N First Street and Meridian Street. A [[Railway roundhouse|Roundhouse]] was located at N First Street and Madison Street.<ref>\"A GALA DAY\", The Plainville Times, August 16, 1888, p. 1.</ref>\n\nPlainville Mill & Elevator Co., (est. 1893) was a major employer and purchaser of locally grown wheat. The original mill was destroyed by fire in 1899 and soon replaced by a larger mill. The flour produced by the mill was of such fine quality, the company won a gold medal at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|1904 World's Fair]]. The mill was again destroyed by fire in 1950. Plainville Mill & Elevator Co. was located on N First Street between Madison and Meridian Streets.<ref name=\"Dougherty, Harriet 1961, pp. 12-13\"/><ref>\"MODERN CONCRETE STRUCTURE WILL REPLACE MILL DESTROYED BY FIRE\", Plainville Times, June 15, 1950, p. 1.</ref>\n\nIn 1909, fire devastated the Plainville business district. The fire apparently started in a butcher shop on the south side of Mill Street in the early morning hours. Fire quickly spread to the north side of Mill Street. Seventeen structures were destroyed before the fire was contained. The burned out wooden buildings were replaced with stone and brick structures, many still standing on Mill Street today.<ref>\"DEVASTATED BY FIRE\", The Plainville Gazette, October 7, 1909, pp. 1, 8.</ref>\n\nOil was discovered in [[Rooks County]] in 1927. The oil boom brought significant growth to Plainville in the 1940s and 1950s.

In order to establish a post office, Griffin completed a [[US Postal Service]] application that required the signature of the local [[Justice of the Peace]]. While reviewing the application, Justice of the Peace Lambert P. Darland suggested the name \"Plainville\". Griffin operated the Plainville post office and a small store from his [[sod house]], the first structure in what would become the city of Plainville.<ref name=\"Dougherty, Harriet 1961, pp. 12-13\">Dougherty, Harriet. \"History of Plainville City and Township\", Plainville Times, September 21, 1961, pp. 12-13.</ref>\n\nIn 1888, Plainville filed for [[municipal incorporation|incorporation]] with 500 residents. Dan E. Miller was elected the first mayor. The first city council consisted of Dr. Volney M. Gray, Murray C. Knox, John Mullin, George Brooks and David E. Mickey.<ref>\"PLAINVILLE'S PROGRESS\", The Plainville Times, July 26, 1888, pp. 1, 4.</ref>\n\n[[Union Pacific Railroad]] established an east-west route through Plainville in August 1888. The train tracks ran parallel to Mill Street, approximately one block to the north. The [[Train station|Train Depot]] was located on the northwest corner of N First Street and Meridian Street. A [[Railway roundhouse|Roundhouse]] was located at N First Street and Madison Street.<ref>\"A GALA DAY\", The Plainville Times, August 16, 1888, p. 1.</ref>\n\nPlainville Mill & Elevator Co., (est. 1893) was a major employer and purchaser of locally grown wheat. The original mill was destroyed by fire in 1899 and soon replaced by a larger mill. The flour produced by the mill was of such fine quality, the company won a gold medal at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|1904 World\u2019s Fair]]. The mill was again destroyed by fire in 1950. Plainville Mill & Elevator Co. was located on N First Street between Madison and Meridian Streets.<ref name=\"Dougherty, Harriet 1961, pp. 12-13\"/><ref>\"MODERN CONCRETE STRUCTURE WILL REPLACE MILL DESTROYED BY FIRE\", Plainville Times, June 15, 1950, p. 1.</ref>\n\nIn 1909, fire devastated the Plainville business district. The fire apparently started in a butcher shop on the south side of Mill Street in the early morning hours. Fire quickly spread to the north side of Mill Street. Seventeen structures were destroyed before the fire was contained. The burned out wooden buildings were replaced with stone and brick structures, many still standing on Mill Street today.<ref>\"DEVASTATED BY FIRE\", The Plainville Gazette, October 7, 1909, pp. 1, 8.</ref>\n\nOil was discovered in [[Rooks County]] in 1927.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] under {{convert|100|ft|m|}} in length, it was designated as ''WPB-82324'' when commissioned and acquired the name ''Point Grey'' in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than {{convert|65|ft|m|}}.<ref name=\"USCG\">[http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Point_Class_WPB_Index.asp Coast Guard Historian website]</ref><ref name=Scheina72>Scheina, p 72</ref>\n\n==Construction and design details==\n''Point Grey'' was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.<ref name=Scheina71>Scheina, p 71</ref> She was powered by two {{convert|600|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT600 [[Cummins]] diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed {{convert|42|inch|m|abbr=on}} propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by {{convert|800|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was {{convert|1550|gal|liters|}} and fuel tank capacity was {{convert|1840|gal|liters|}} at 95% full.<ref name=\"USCG\" /><ref name=Scheina71>Scheina, p 71</ref> Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref>\n\nThe design specifications for ''Point Grey'' included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer [[Watch system|watch]] in the engine room.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref> Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref> The [[Propeller|screw]]s were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a [[ship floodability|watertight door]] on the [[starboard side]] aft of the [[deckhouse]]. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, [[scuttlebutt]], a small desk and [[Head (watercraft)|head]]. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]], [[mess]] and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.<ref name=\"USCG\" /><ref name=Scheina72>Scheina, p 72</ref><ref name=Scotti10>Scotti, p 10</ref><ref name=Scotti219>Scotti, p 219</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter delivery in 1961, ''Point Grey'' was assigned a homeport of [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat.<ref name=\"USCG\" />\n\nAt the request of the [[United States Navy]], in April 1965, she was alerted for service in [[South Vietnam]] and assigned to [[Coast Guard Squadron One]] in support of [[Operation Market Time]] along with 16 other Point class cutters.<ref name =Cutler84>Cutler, p 84</ref><ref name=Larzelere21>Larzelere, p 21</ref> While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at [[Coast Guard Island]] and [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area|Camp Parks, California]], ''Point Grey'' was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to [[Subic Bay]], [[Philippines]] in May 1965 where she was refitted for combat service.<ref name=\"USCG\" /> Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of four [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 machine guns]].

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1961 was not to name [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] under {{convert|100|ft|m|}} in length, it was designated as ''WPB-82324'' when commissioned and acquired the name ''Point Grey'' in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than {{convert|65|ft|m|}}.<ref name=\"USCG\">[http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Point_Class_WPB_Index.asp Coast Guard Historian website]</ref><ref name=Scheina72>Scheina, p 72</ref>\n\n==Construction and design details==\n''Point Grey'' was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.<ref name=Scheina71>Scheina, p 71</ref> She was powered by two {{convert|600|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT600 [[Cummins]] diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed {{convert|42|inch|m|abbr=on}} propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by {{convert|800|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was {{convert|1550|gal|liters|}} and fuel tank capacity was {{convert|1840|gal|liters|}} at 95% full.<ref name=\"USCG\" /><ref name=Scheina71>Scheina, p 71</ref> Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref>\n\nThe design specifications for ''Point Grey'' included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer [[Watch system|watch]] in the engine room.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref> Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref> The [[Propeller|screw]]s were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a [[ship floodability|watertight door]] on the [[starboard side]] aft of the [[deckhouse]]. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, [[scuttlebutt]], a small desk and [[Head (watercraft)|head]]. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]], [[mess]] and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.<ref name=\"USCG\" /><ref name=Scheina72>Scheina, p 72</ref><ref name=Scotti10>Scotti, p 10</ref><ref name=Scotti219>Scotti, p 219</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter delivery in 1961, ''Point Grey'' was assigned a homeport of [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat.<ref name=\"USCG\" />\n\nAt the request of the [[United States Navy]], in April 1965, she was alerted for service in [[South Vietnam]] and assigned to [[Coast Guard Squadron One]] in support of [[Operation Market Time]] along with 16 other Point class cutters.<ref name =Cutler84>Cutler, p 84</ref><ref name=Larzelere21>Larzelere, p 21</ref> While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at [[Coast Guard Island]] and [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area|Camp Parks, California]], ''Point Grey'' was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to [[Subic Bay]], [[Philippines]] in May 1965 where she was refitted for combat service.<ref name=\"USCG\" /> Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of four [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 machine guns]].

During September 1965, {{USS|Krishna|ARL-38|6}}, a repair ship outfitted for the repair of WPB's relieved the ''Floyd County''. Also during this time, the WPB's were directed to paint the hulls and superstructures formula 20 deck gray to cover the stateside white paint. This increased the effectiveness of night patrols.<ref name=Cutler85>Cutler, p 85</ref>\n\nOn 26 September 1965, ''Point Grey'' and ''Point Comfort'' embarked a raiding party of 36  [[Civilian Irregular Defense Group]] (CIDG) mercenaries, their Vietnamese officers and 2 [[U.S. Army]] [[Special Forces]] advisors that were tasked with a night raid of [[Hon Mot Island]]. ''Point Grey'', assisted by ''Point Marone'' provided covering fire and medical evacuation for the wounded.<ref name=Larzelere55>Larzelere, p 55</ref>\n\nOn 9 May 1966 while on patrol, ''Point Grey'' interdicted a 120-foot steel hull trawler that beached itself under covering fire from [[Viet Cong]] (VC) hiding in the tree line. With the assistance of {{USS|Brister|DER-327|6}} and {{USS|Vireo|MSC-205|6}} the VC were prevented from boarding the trawler to retrieve the arms and supplies it carried. ''Point Grey'' was hit with machine gun fire from the shore; part of the crew were injured and substantial damage was done to the bridge of the cutter.

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1960 was not to name [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] under {{convert|100|ft|m|}} in length, it was designated as ''WPB-82307'' when commissioned and acquired the name ''Point Glover'' in January 1964 when the Coast Guard started naming all cutters longer than {{convert|65|ft|m|}}.<ref name=\"USCG\">[http://www.uscg.mil/history/webcutters/Point_Class_WPB_Index.asp Coast Guard Historian website]</ref><ref name=Scheina72>Scheina, p 72</ref>\n\n==Construction and design details==\n''Point Glover'' was built to accommodate an 8-man crew.<ref name=Scheina71>Scheina, p 71</ref> She was powered by two {{convert|600|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT600 [[Cummins]] diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed {{convert|42|inch|m|abbr=on}} propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by {{convert|800|hp|0|abbr=on}} VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was {{convert|1550|gal|liters|}} and fuel tank capacity was {{convert|1840|gal|liters|}} at 95% full.<ref name=\"USCG\" /><ref name=Scheina71>Scheina, p 71</ref> Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref>\n\nThe design specifications for ''Point Glover'' included a steel hull for durability and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer [[Watch system|watch]] in the engine room.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref> Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service.<ref name=Scotti165>Scotti, p 165</ref> The [[Propeller|screw]]s were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a [[ship floodability|watertight door]] on the [[starboard side]] aft of the [[deckhouse]]. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, [[scuttlebutt]], a small desk and [[Head (watercraft)|head]]. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]], [[mess]] and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode.<ref name=Scotti166>Scotti, p 166</ref> Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam service.<ref name=\"USCG\" /><ref name=Scheina72>Scheina, p 72</ref><ref name=Scotti10>Scotti, p 10</ref><ref name=Scotti219>Scotti, p 219</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter delivery in 1960, ''Point Glover'' was assigned a homeport of [[Fort Hancock, New Jersey]], where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. On 6 May 1962, she towed a disabled pleasure craft near [[Sandy Hook, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"USCG\" />\n\nAt the request of the [[United States Navy]], in April 1965, she was alerted for service in [[South Vietnam]] and assigned to [[Coast Guard Squadron One]] in support of [[Operation Market Time]] along with 16 other Point class cutters.<ref name =Cutler84>Cutler, p 84</ref><ref name=Larzelere21>Larzelere, p 21</ref> While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at [[Coast Guard Island]] and [[Parks Reserve Forces Training Area|Camp Parks, California]], ''Point Glover'' was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to [[Subic Bay]], [[Philippines]] in May 1965 where she was refitted for combat service.<ref name=\"USCG\" /> Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, bunks, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of four [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 machine guns]]. The original bow-mounted machine gun was replaced with a combination over-under .50 caliber machine gun/81&nbsp;mm trigger-fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in Vietnam.<ref name=\"Wells\" /><ref name=\"USCG\" /><ref name=Larzelere21>Larzelere, p 21</ref><ref name=Cutler82>Cutler, p 82</ref>  For service in Vietnam, two officers were added to the crew complement to add seniority to the crew in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.<ref name=Larzelere15>Larzelere, p 15</ref>\n\n''Point Glover'' was assigned to Division 11 of Squadron One to be based at [[An Th\u1edbi, Ki\u00ean Giang|An Th\u1edbi]], a small fishing village on the southern tip of [[Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c]] island along with {{USCGC|Point Banks|WPB-82327|6}}, {{USCGC|Point Clear|WPB-82315|6}}, {{USCGC|Point Comfort|WPB-82317|6}}, {{USCGC|Point Garnet|WPB-82310|6}}, {{USCGC|Point Grey|WPB-82324|6}}, {{USCGC|Point Marone|WPB-82331|6}}, {{USCGC|Point Mast|WPB-82316|6}}, and {{USCGC|Point Young|WPB-82303|6}}. After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c on 17 July 1965 in the company of {{USS|Floyd County|LST-762|6}}, their temporary support ship. After almost two weeks at sea, they arrived at their new duty station on 1 August and began patrolling the waters in the [[Gulf of Thailand]] near the [[Ca Mau]] peninsula.<ref name=Kelley5-97>Kelley, p 5-97</ref><ref name=Larzelere48>Larzelere, p 48</ref> Duty consisted of boarding Vietnamese junks to search for contraband weapons and ammunition and check the identification papers of persons on board. During September 1965, {{USS|Krishna|ARL-38}}, a repair ship outfitted for the repair of WPB's relieved the ''Floyd County''. Also during this time, the WPB's were directed to paint the hulls and superstructures formula 20 deck gray to cover the stateside white paint. This increased the effectiveness of night patrols.<ref name=Cutler85>Cutler, p 85</ref>\n\nOn 19 September 1965, ''Point Glover'' sank one [[Viet Cong]] junk and assisted ''Point Marone'' in the capture of another near [[H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean]].<ref name=Kelley5-208>Kelley, p 5-208</ref> Both junks had arms, ammunition, and documents on board.<ref name=Cutler110>Cutler, p 110</ref><ref name=Larzelere45>Larzelere, p 45</ref>\n \nBy fall of 1969 the crew of the ''Point Glover'' was training a replacement [[Republic of Vietnam Navy]] (RVNN) crew for the eventual turnover of the cutter to RVNN control. On 14 February 1970, ''Point Glover'' was turned over to the RVNN as part of the [[Vietnamization]] of the war effort and recommissioned as RVNS ''\u0110\u00e0o V\u0103n \u0110\u1eb7ng'' (HQ-711).<ref name=Scotti210>Scotti, p 210</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:United States Coast Guard Point Glover March 1967.pdf|United States Coast Guard Point Glover March 1967\nFile:United States Coast Guard Point Glover November 1969.pdf|United States Coast Guard Point Glover November 1969\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n;Bibliography\n* {{cite book|last=Cutler|first=Thomas J.|authorlink=Thomas J.

This increased the effectiveness of night patrols.<ref name=Cutler85>Cutler, p 85</ref>\n\nOn 19 September 1965, ''Point Glover'' sank one [[Viet Cong]] junk and assisted ''Point Marone'' in the capture of another near [[H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean]].<ref name=Kelley5-208>Kelley, p 5-208</ref> Both junks had arms, ammunition, and documents on board.<ref name=Cutler110>Cutler, p 110</ref><ref name=Larzelere45>Larzelere, p 45</ref>\n \nBy fall of 1969 the crew of the ''Point Glover'' was training a replacement [[Republic of Vietnam Navy]] (RVNN) crew for the eventual turnover of the cutter to RVNN control. On 14 February 1970, ''Point Glover'' was turned over to the RVNN as part of the [[Vietnamization]] of the war effort and recommissioned as RVNS ''\u0110\u00e0o V\u0103n \u0110\u1eb7ng'' (HQ-711).<ref name=Scotti210>Scotti, p 210</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:United States Coast Guard Point Glover March 1967.pdf|United States Coast Guard Point Glover March 1967\nFile:United States Coast Guard Point Glover November 1969.pdf|United States Coast Guard Point Glover November 1969\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n;Bibliography\n* {{cite book|last=Cutler|first=Thomas J.|authorlink=Thomas J.
