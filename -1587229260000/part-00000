Folk costume has various details according to the place of origin and social status of the wearer. The modern dirndl is heavily stylized but clearly influenced by typical Bavarian costume.

These were first exhibited by company models at summer parties in the Alps. The breakthrough came in 1910, when the Wallach brothers organized and paid for the show of folk costumes for the centenary celebrations of the Oktoberfest.<ref> Heidi Hagen-Pekdemir: Bielefelder machten das Dirndl erst schick.

Folk costume has various details according to the place of origin and social status of the wearer. The modern dirndl is heavily stylized but clearly influenced by typical Bavarian costume.

These were first exhibited by company models at summer parties in the Alps. The breakthrough came in 1910, when the Wallach brothers organized and paid for the show of folk costumes for the centenary celebrations of the Oktoberfest.<ref> Heidi Hagen-Pekdemir: Bielefelder machten das Dirndl erst schick.

The origin of the name ''Niger'', which originally applied only to the middle reaches of the Niger River, is uncertain. The word is likely an alteration of the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] name ''egerew <u>n-iger</u>ewen''  used by inhabitants along the middle reaches of the river around [[Timbuktu]] prior to 19th-century European colonialism.<ref>The Arabic name ''nahr al-anhur'' is a direct translation of the Tuareg.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Niger |title=''Online Etymological Dictionary'' |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Nigeria|Timeline of Nigerian history}}\n[[File:Intricate bronze ceremonial pot, 9th century, Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Ceremonial Igbo pot from 9th-century [[Igbo-Ukwu]]]]\n\n=== Early (1,500 BC \u2013 1500) ===\n{{Further|History of Nigeria before 1500}}\n[[File:Nok sculpture Louvre 70-1998-11-1.jpg|thumb|[[Nok]] sculpture, [[terracotta]]]]\nThe [[Nok culture|Nok civilisation]] of [[Northern Nigeria]] flourished between 1,500 BC and AD 200.

In the 16th century, [[Portuguese explorers]] were the first Europeans to begin significant, direct trade with peoples of modern-day Nigeria, at the port they named [[Lagos]] and in [[Calabar]].

The Atlantic slave trade was engaged in by European companies until it was outlawed in 1807.  After that illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast by native slavers. Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]] sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akitoye]], and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]]. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland.

The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], and part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.  In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]]. Inhabitants of the southern region sustained more interaction, economic and cultural, with the British and other Europeans owing to the coastal economy.<ref>Toyin Falola and Matthew M.

With the fall of oil prices during the [[1980s oil glut]] Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigerian authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15&nbsp;billion annually for poverty reduction programmes.

The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English as it is in Cameroon.\n\nThe major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[languages of Africa]]: the majority are [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]], [[Fulfulde]], [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]], and [[Edo language|Edo]]. [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily in [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]], is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family, and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language.\n\nEven though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself.\n\nWith the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], often known simply as \"[[Pidgin]]\" or \"Broken\" (Broken English), is also a popular [[lingua franca]], though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the [[Niger Delta]] Regions, predominantly in [[Warri]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Agenebode]], [[Ewu]], and [[Benin City]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Multilingualism: A Nigerian Case Study |first=Efurosibina E. |last=Adegbija |publisher=Africa World Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-59221-173-9 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=auI_WuBrWncC&pg=PA55 |location=Last paragraph |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Nigeria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Nigeria (2013)<ref name=\"Cia 19\">CIA Factbook : Nigeria [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html] (Retrieved 1 May 2019)</ref>\n\n|label1 = [[Islam]]\n|value1 = 51.6\n|color1 = Green\n|label2 = [[Christianity]]\n|value2 = 47\n|color2 = DodgerBlue\n|label3 = [[Traditional African religions]]\n|value3 = 1.4\n|color3 = White\n}}\n\nNigeria is a religiously diverse society, with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] being the most widely professed religions.

The Atlantic slave trade was engaged in by European companies until it was outlawed in 1807.  After that illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast by native slavers. Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]] sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akitoye]], and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]]. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland.

The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], and part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.  In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]].

With the fall of oil prices during the [[1980s oil glut]] Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigerian authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15&nbsp;billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30&nbsp;billion) owed to the Paris Club.\n\nNigeria is trying to reach the first of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], which is to [[Ending poverty in all its forms everywhere|end poverty]] in all its forms by 2030.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n{{Further|Agriculture in Nigeria}}\n[[File:Farm Ploughing, Kwara State, Nigeria.jpg|thumb|Farm ploughing in [[Kwara State]]]]\n{{As of|2010}}, about 30% of Nigerians are employed in agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/pages/download/41 |title=Labour Force Statistics, 2010 |publisher=Nigerian Bureau of Statistics |date=2010 |accessdate=22 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424153316/http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/pages/download/41 |archivedate=24 April 2015}}</ref> Agriculture used to be the principal foreign exchange earner of Nigeria.<ref>{{cite book |title=Democracy and Development in Africa |first=Claude |last=Ake |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-8157-0220-7 |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bs5rTH7GClgC&pg=PA48 |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nMajor crops include [[beans]], [[sesame]], [[cashew nuts]], [[cassava]], [[cocoa beans]], [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]], [[gum arabic]],  kolanut, [[maize]] (corn), [[melon]], [[millet]], [[palm kernel]]s, [[palm oil]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[rice]], [[rubber]], [[sorghum]], [[soybeans]] and [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]].<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Nigeria-AGRICULTURE.html|title=Agriculture \u2013 Nigeria \u2013 export, growth, area, crops, farming, sector|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> [[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] is the leading non-oil foreign exchange earner.<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\"/> [[Rubber]] is the second-largest non-oil foreign exchange earner.<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\"/>\n\nPrior to the [[Nigerian civil war]], Nigeria was self-sufficient in food.<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\"/> Agriculture has failed to keep pace with Nigeria's rapid population growth, and Nigeria now relies upon food imports to sustain itself.<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\"/> The Nigerian government promoted the use of inorganic fertilizers in the 1970s.<ref name=\"pasquini\">{{cite journal|last=Pasquini|first=MW|last2=Alexander|first2=MJ|date=2005|title=Soil fertility management strategies on the Jos Plateau: the need for integrating 'empirical' and 'scientific' knowledge in agricultural development|journal=Geographical Journal|volume=171|issue=2|pages=112\u2013124|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00154.x}}</ref> In August 2019, Nigeria closed its border with Benin to stop rice smuggling into the country as part of efforts to boost the local production.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN1VJ0PH-OZATP|title=Nigeria closes part of border with Benin to check rice smuggling|date=29 August 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=29 August 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n\n=== Ecology ===\nNigeria is greatly endowed with numerous tree species of which the majority of them are native while few are exotic.

It was launched on 13 May 2007, aboard a Chinese [[Long March 3B]] [[carrier rocket]], from the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Centre]] in [[China]]. The spacecraft was operated by [[NigComSat]] and the Nigerian Space Agency, [[NASRDA]]. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after running out of power because of an anomaly in its solar array. It was based on the Chinese [[DFH-4]] [[satellite bus]], and carries a variety of [[transponder]]s: 4 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]]; 14 [[Ku-band]]; 8 [[Ka-band]]; and 2 [[L-band]]. It was designed to provide coverage to many parts of Africa, and the Ka-band transponders would also cover Italy.\n\nOn 10 November 2008 (0900 GMT), the satellite was reportedly switched off for analysis and to avoid a possible collision with other satellites.

The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country, owing to the influence of [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonisation]] that ended in 1960.\n\nMany French speakers from surrounding countries have influenced the English spoken in the border regions of Nigeria and some Nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in French to work in the surrounding countries. The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English as it is in Cameroon.\n\nThe major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[languages of Africa]]: the majority are [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]], [[Fulfulde]], [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]], and [[Edo language|Edo]]. [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily in [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]], is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family, and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language.\n\nEven though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself.\n\nWith the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups.

John Field, his father, a London medical practitioner, and founder of the [[London Annuity Society]], was a man of property, who married Anne, daughter of Thomas Cromwell, a grocer, and sister of [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Field got a good classical training; while at school he corresponded with his father in Latin. He studied for the ministry first at [[Homerton]], but left that institution for doctrinal reasons soon after the appointment of [[John Fell (tutor)|John Fell]]. In 1788 he entered [[Daventry Academy]] under [[Thomas Belsham]], and left when Belsham resigned (June 1789).\n\n==Religious career==\nField succeeded James Kettle in 1789 as minister of the presbyterian congregation at [[Warwick, Warwickshire]], where he was ordained on 12 July 1790. On this occasion Belsham gave the charge, and [[Joseph Priestley]] preached. Dr. [[Samuel Parr]], who then first met Priestley, attended the service and the ordination dinner. Thus began Field's close intimacy with Parr, a connection fostered by their common devotion to classical studies. Field at once (1791) started a Sunday school (the first in Warwick). This led him into a squabble with some local clergy. Field, who was always ready for a [[pamphlet]] war, issued the first of many productions of his incisive pen, in which the dignity of style, and the profusion of literary and classical illustration, contrast curiously with the pettiness of the disputes. His [[meeting-house]], rebuilt 1780, was fitted with a sloping floor, to improve its quality as an [[auditorium]]; Field excited some comment by surmounting the front of the building with a stone cross. About 1830 he undertook the charge of an old [[Presbyterian]] meeting-house at [[Kenilworth]], conducting afternoon service in addition to his Warwick duties. This meeting-house was rebuilt (1846) by his son [[Edwin Wilkins Field]]. Field remained in active duty for nearly sixty years. He resigned Warwick in 1843, and was succeeded in 1844 by Henry Ashton Meeson, M.D. At Kenilworth he was succeeded in 1850 by John Gordon.\n\n==Teaching career==\nField kept a boarding-school for many years at [[Royal Leamington Spa|Leam]], near Warwick. This led to his publishing some educational manuals, of which the most valuable was his ''Questions on the Gospel History'', recommended in the ''[[The Critical Review|Critical Review]]'' (June 1794) to theological students in the two universities. His history of Warwick and his life of Parr are important works.\n\n==Death and family==\nHe died at Leam on 16 August 1851; a marble slab to his memory was placed in High Street Chapel, Warwick. \n\nBy his wife, Mary (Wilkins), who died at Liverpool on 2 October 1848, aged 64, he had a numerous family.

Known for his legal expertise, he also served as a financial administrator. He served three kings of England before his death.\n\nBardulf began his royal service under King [[Henry II of England]], where he was a steward to the royal household. He also served as a royal justice and a [[High Sheriff|sheriff]] during Henry's reign, and continued as sheriff under Henry's son and successor, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. Because Bardulf was a [[vassal]] of Richard's younger brother [[John of England|John]], who rebelled against his older brother, Bardulf was denounced briefly as a traitor to Richard. He was quickly restored to royal service, however, and continued in service throughout the rest of Richard's reign and into the reign of John. Bardulf died sometime before 1203, and his heir was his brother, Robert Bardulf.\n\n==Early life==\n\nHistorians are divided on Hugh Bardulf's ancestry. [[Katharine Keats-Rohan]] says that he was the son of Hamelin Bardulf, a tenant of Hugh Bigod, who held land in Suffolk.<ref name=DD162/> Ralph V. Turner, revising [[John Horace Round]]'s entry in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' for the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says that Hugh was the son of a Hugh Bardulf who died around 1176. According to Turner and Round, the younger Hugh's mother was Isabel, who may have been a member of the Twist family from Lincolnshire.<ref name=DNB>Round \"Bardolf, Hugh (d. 1203)\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> The younger Hugh acquired land at [[Waddington, Lincolnshire|Waddington]], Lincolnshire as a tenant of [[Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester]], sometime in the middle 1140s.<ref name=DD162>Keats-Rohan ''Domesday Descendants'' p. 162</ref>\n\n==Royal service==\n\nIn 1181 Bardulf was at the court of King Henry II of England, where he was [[butler|steward]],<ref name=DNB/> or [[dapifer]], an office he held throughout Henry's reign and which he may have held throughout the next reign also.<ref name=Judiciary82>Turner ''English Judiciary'' pp. 82\u201384</ref> He held that office until Henry's death in 1189. From about 1185 until 1203, Bardulf was a royal justice almost annually, usually as a [[Eyre (legal term)|justice of eyre]] rather than sitting at Westminster. He performed the duties of sheriff for the following counties: [[High Sheriff of Cornwall|Cornwall]] from 1184\u20131187, [[High Sheriff of Wiltshire|Wiltshire]] from 1187 to 1189, [[High Sheriff of Somerset|Somerset]] during 1188 and 1189 along with [[High Sheriff of Dorset|Dorset]] during the same period, the counties of [[High Sheriff of Staffordshire|Staffordshire]], [[High Sheriff of Warwickshire|Warwickshire]] and [[High Sheriff of Leicestershire|Leicestershire]] during 1190 and 1191, [[High Sheriff of Yorkshire|Yorkshire]] from 1191 to 1194, [[High Sheriff of Westmorland|Westmorland]] from 1191 to 1199, [[High Sheriff of Northumberland|Northumberland]] from 1194 to 1198, [[High Sheriff of Cumberland|Cumberland]] during 1198 and 1199, Cornwall again from 1199 to 1200 along with [[High Sheriff of Devon|Devonshire]], and [[High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests|Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire]] from 1200 to 1203.<ref name=DNB/> In 1194 Bardulf was mentioned on the [[escheat roll]] as responsible for the farm of lands held by [[Osbert de Bayeux]], an archdeacon of York.<ref name=DNBOB>Burton \"Bayeux, Osbert de (fl. 1120\u20131184)\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>\n\n==Under Richard and John==\n\nIn 1189, Hugh was one of only five sitting sheriffs who retained their office when Richard took the throne; the others included [[Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex|Geoffrey fitzPeter]], [[William Brewer (justice)|William Briwerre]], and [[Ranulf de Glanvill]].<ref name=Interp99>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' p. 99</ref> However, in 1189, Bardulf did lose custody of [[Old Sarum|Salisbury Castle]], which he had held under Henry.<ref name=Interp104>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' p. 104</ref> Henry had given Bardulf the manor and barony of Brampton in Devonshire, but when Richard took the throne, the king took back Brampton, and gave Bardulf the manor of Hoo in Kent instead.<ref name=Judiciary111>Turner ''English Judiciary'' pp. 111\u2013112</ref>\n\nAlthough Bardulf set out with the new King, Richard I on the [[Third Crusade]], he turned back after a period in [[Messina]], and returned to England. There, he was part of the administration during the [[Justiciar]]ship of [[Hugh de Puiset]], the [[Bishop of Durham]], and [[William Longchamp]], the [[Bishop of Ely]].<ref name=DNB/> Longchamp gave him custody of [[Kenilworth Castle]].<ref name=Interp116>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' p. 116</ref> Bardulf then was involved in the attempts of [[Walter de Coutances]] to remove Longchamp from office, which led to Longchamp excommunicating Bardulf. In 1193, Bardulf helped with the defences of Doncaster against the forces of Prince [[John of England|John]], Richard's brother, who was rebelling against Richard while the king was on crusade. However, Bardulf refused to besiege [[Tickhill]] near Doncaster, because he was a vassal of John's, which led to him being denounced as a traitor.<ref name=DNB/> Although he was required to surrender his [[shrievalty]] of Yorkshire, he was immediately appointed to other sheriff offices.<ref name=DNB/> On 31 March 1194, Hugh was named an [[escheator]] for estates confiscated by Richard in the northern part of England in relation to John's rebellion.<ref name=Richard270>Gillingham ''Richard I'' pp. 270\u2013271</ref> While Richard was in captivity in Germany in 1193, Bardulf, along with [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshall]], Geoffrey fitzPeter and William Briwerre, was a recipient of letters from the captive king, urging the election of [[Hubert Walter]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=West79>West ''Justiciarship in England'' p. 79</ref>\n\nBardulf was also a financial administrator. He served as a [[Exchequer of Pleas|Baron of the Exchequer]] during the reigns of Henry, Richard and John.<ref name=DNB/> In 1196, he was the collector of taxation in seven shires, along with [[Philip of Poitou]], the bishop-elect of Durham.<ref name=Tax291>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 291</ref> Around 1197, Hugh was named as responsible for the \"bail and custody\" of the Jewish population in England, along with [[William of Sainte-M\u00e8re-Eglise]], the [[Bishop of London]], who was his fellow escheator in the north.<ref name=Judiciary82/> The office in charge of the bail and custody of the Jews was probably a forerunner of the office of Keeper of the Jews.<ref name=Judiciary86>Turner ''English Judiciary'' p. 86</ref>\n\nBardulf continued to serve Richard until the king's death, and then served John, who became king, until sometime before [[Michaelmas]] 1203, when records show that Bardulf was known to be deceased.<ref name=DNB/>\n\n==Legacy and personal life==\n\nBardulf was known for his legal expertise, which led to him being one of the few justices mentioned by name in ''[[Tractatus of Glanvill|Glanvill]]'', an early medieval English legal text, although whether by the original author or by a [[glossator]], is unclear.<ref name=Govern274>Richardson and Sayres ''Governance of Mediaeval England'' p. 274 and footnote 2</ref> His long career as a justice helped create a sense of continuity in judicial matters through the reigns of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin]] kings.<ref name=Bartlett192>Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 192</ref> He remained on such good terms with Hubert Walter, that when Walter was appointed chancellor at the beginning of John's reign, Bardulf made a comment to the new chancellor that included a pointed barb about the last Archbishop of Canterbury to also be chancellor, [[Thomas Becket]].

Known for his legal expertise, he also served as a financial administrator. He served three kings of England before his death.\n\nBardulf began his royal service under King [[Henry II of England]], where he was a steward to the royal household. He also served as a royal justice and a [[High Sheriff|sheriff]] during Henry's reign, and continued as sheriff under Henry's son and successor, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. Because Bardulf was a [[vassal]] of Richard's younger brother [[John of England|John]], who rebelled against his older brother, Bardulf was denounced briefly as a traitor to Richard. He was quickly restored to royal service, however, and continued in service throughout the rest of Richard's reign and into the reign of John. Bardulf died sometime before 1203, and his heir was his brother, Robert Bardulf.\n\n==Early life==\n\nHistorians are divided on Hugh Bardulf's ancestry. [[Katharine Keats-Rohan]] says that he was the son of Hamelin Bardulf, a tenant of Hugh Bigod, who held land in Suffolk.<ref name=DD162/> Ralph V. Turner, revising [[John Horace Round]]'s entry in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' for the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says that Hugh was the son of a Hugh Bardulf who died around 1176. According to Turner and Round, the younger Hugh's mother was Isabel, who may have been a member of the Twist family from Lincolnshire.<ref name=DNB>Round \"Bardolf, Hugh (d. 1203)\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> The younger Hugh acquired land at [[Waddington, Lincolnshire|Waddington]], Lincolnshire as a tenant of [[Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester]], sometime in the middle 1140s.<ref name=DD162>Keats-Rohan ''Domesday Descendants'' p. 162</ref>\n\n==Royal service==\n\nIn 1181 Bardulf was at the court of King Henry II of England, where he was [[butler|steward]],<ref name=DNB/> or [[dapifer]], an office he held throughout Henry's reign and which he may have held throughout the next reign also.<ref name=Judiciary82>Turner ''English Judiciary'' pp. 82\u201384</ref> He held that office until Henry's death in 1189. From about 1185 until 1203, Bardulf was a royal justice almost annually, usually as a [[Eyre (legal term)|justice of eyre]] rather than sitting at Westminster. He performed the duties of sheriff for the following counties: [[High Sheriff of Cornwall|Cornwall]] from 1184\u20131187, [[High Sheriff of Wiltshire|Wiltshire]] from 1187 to 1189, [[High Sheriff of Somerset|Somerset]] during 1188 and 1189 along with [[High Sheriff of Dorset|Dorset]] during the same period, the counties of [[High Sheriff of Staffordshire|Staffordshire]], [[High Sheriff of Warwickshire|Warwickshire]] and [[High Sheriff of Leicestershire|Leicestershire]] during 1190 and 1191, [[High Sheriff of Yorkshire|Yorkshire]] from 1191 to 1194, [[High Sheriff of Westmorland|Westmorland]] from 1191 to 1199, [[High Sheriff of Northumberland|Northumberland]] from 1194 to 1198, [[High Sheriff of Cumberland|Cumberland]] during 1198 and 1199, Cornwall again from 1199 to 1200 along with [[High Sheriff of Devon|Devonshire]], and [[High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests|Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire]] from 1200 to 1203.<ref name=DNB/> In 1194 Bardulf was mentioned on the [[escheat roll]] as responsible for the farm of lands held by [[Osbert de Bayeux]], an archdeacon of York.<ref name=DNBOB>Burton \"Bayeux, Osbert de (fl. 1120\u20131184)\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref>\n\n==Under Richard and John==\n\nIn 1189, Hugh was one of only five sitting sheriffs who retained their office when Richard took the throne; the others included [[Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex|Geoffrey fitzPeter]], [[William Brewer (justice)|William Briwerre]], and [[Ranulf de Glanvill]].<ref name=Interp99>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' p. 99</ref> However, in 1189, Bardulf did lose custody of [[Old Sarum|Salisbury Castle]], which he had held under Henry.<ref name=Interp104>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' p. 104</ref> Henry had given Bardulf the manor and barony of Brampton in Devonshire, but when Richard took the throne, the king took back Brampton, and gave Bardulf the manor of Hoo in Kent instead.<ref name=Judiciary111>Turner ''English Judiciary'' pp. 111\u2013112</ref>\n\nAlthough Bardulf set out with the new King, Richard I on the [[Third Crusade]], he turned back after a period in [[Messina]], and returned to England. There, he was part of the administration during the [[Justiciar]]ship of [[Hugh de Puiset]], the [[Bishop of Durham]], and [[William Longchamp]], the [[Bishop of Ely]].<ref name=DNB/> Longchamp gave him custody of [[Kenilworth Castle]].<ref name=Interp116>Turner and Heiser ''Reign of Richard Lionheart'' p. 116</ref> Bardulf then was involved in the attempts of [[Walter de Coutances]] to remove Longchamp from office, which led to Longchamp excommunicating Bardulf. In 1193, Bardulf helped with the defences of Doncaster against the forces of Prince [[John of England|John]], Richard's brother, who was rebelling against Richard while the king was on crusade. However, Bardulf refused to besiege [[Tickhill]] near Doncaster, because he was a vassal of John's, which led to him being denounced as a traitor.<ref name=DNB/> Although he was required to surrender his [[shrievalty]] of Yorkshire, he was immediately appointed to other sheriff offices.<ref name=DNB/> On 31 March 1194, Hugh was named an [[escheator]] for estates confiscated by Richard in the northern part of England in relation to John's rebellion.<ref name=Richard270>Gillingham ''Richard I'' pp. 270\u2013271</ref> While Richard was in captivity in Germany in 1193, Bardulf, along with [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshall]], Geoffrey fitzPeter and William Briwerre, was a recipient of letters from the captive king, urging the election of [[Hubert Walter]] as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=West79>West ''Justiciarship in England'' p. 79</ref>\n\nBardulf was also a financial administrator. He served as a [[Exchequer of Pleas|Baron of the Exchequer]] during the reigns of Henry, Richard and John.<ref name=DNB/> In 1196, he was the collector of taxation in seven shires, along with [[Philip of Poitou]], the bishop-elect of Durham.<ref name=Tax291>Mitchell ''Taxation'' p. 291</ref> Around 1197, Hugh was named as responsible for the \"bail and custody\" of the Jewish population in England, along with [[William of Sainte-M\u00e8re-Eglise]], the [[Bishop of London]], who was his fellow escheator in the north.<ref name=Judiciary82/> The office in charge of the bail and custody of the Jews was probably a forerunner of the office of Keeper of the Jews.<ref name=Judiciary86>Turner ''English Judiciary'' p. 86</ref>\n\nBardulf continued to serve Richard until the king's death, and then served John, who became king, until sometime before [[Michaelmas]] 1203, when records show that Bardulf was known to be deceased.<ref name=DNB/>\n\n==Legacy and personal life==\n\nBardulf was known for his legal expertise, which led to him being one of the few justices mentioned by name in ''[[Tractatus of Glanvill|Glanvill]]'', an early medieval English legal text, although whether by the original author or by a [[glossator]], is unclear.<ref name=Govern274>Richardson and Sayres ''Governance of Mediaeval England'' p. 274 and footnote 2</ref> His long career as a justice helped create a sense of continuity in judicial matters through the reigns of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin]] kings.<ref name=Bartlett192>Bartlett ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'' p. 192</ref> He remained on such good terms with Hubert Walter, that when Walter was appointed chancellor at the beginning of John's reign, Bardulf made a comment to the new chancellor that included a pointed barb about the last Archbishop of Canterbury to also be chancellor, [[Thomas Becket]]. Bardulf was on good enough terms that he was able to tease Walter that \"We have never heard nor seen an archbishop become a chancellor, but we have seen a chancellor become an archbishop.\"<ref name=QJudiciary121>Quoted in Turner ''English Judiciary'' p. 121</ref>\n\nThe justice married Mabel de Limesy, daughter of Gerard de Limesy, and coheir with her sisters of their brother John de Limesy, with the marriage taking place in 1200.
