Six other troopers had died of drowning and 51 in [[cholera]] epidemics. In November 1868, while stationed in Kansas, the 7th Cavalry under Custer had successfully routed [[Black Kettle]]'s Southern Cheyenne camp on the [[Washita River]] in the [[Battle of Washita River]], an attack which was at the time labeled a \"massacre of innocent Indians\" by the [[Indian Bureau]].<ref>[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/218456/pdf Washita Memories: Eyewitness Views of Custer's Attack on Black Kettle's Village (review)], ''[[Project Muse]]'', James T.

About 20% of the troopers had been enlisted in the prior seven months (139 of an enlisted roll of 718), were only marginally trained and had no combat or frontier experience. A sizable number of these recruits were immigrants from Ireland, Britain and Germany, just as many of the veteran troopers had been before their enlistments.

Surprised and according to some accounts astonished by the unusually large numbers of Native Americans, Crook held the field at the end of the battle but felt compelled by his losses to pull back, regroup, and wait for reinforcements. Unaware of Crook's battle, Gibbon and Terry proceeded, joining forces in early June near the mouth of [[Rosebud Creek]]. They reviewed Terry's plan calling for Custer's regiment to proceed south along the Rosebud while Terry and Gibbon's united forces would move in a westerly direction toward the [[Bighorn River|Bighorn]] and [[Little Bighorn River|Little Bighorn]] rivers. As this was the likely location of native encampments, all army elements had been instructed to converge there around June 26 or 27 in an attempt to engulf the Native Americans. On June 22, Terry ordered the 7th Cavalry, composed of 31 officers and 566 enlisted men under Custer, to begin a reconnaissance in force and pursuit along the Rosebud, with the prerogative to \"depart\" from orders if Custer saw \"sufficient reason\".

At sunrise on June 25, Custer's scouts reported they could see a massive pony herd and signs of the Native American village{{refn|group=\"note\"|[[Plains Indians]] were semi-nomadic peoples and had no permanent settlements off the [[Indian reservation|reservations]] (aka \"Agencies).  A \"village\" was a collection of [[tipis]], housing a group of Indians under the leadership of a chief, including those of tribes other than the chief's. A village would be created wherever a group stopped by simply erecting the tipis and could last from a single night to several weeks. Young warriors without a tipi would generally create [[lean-tos]] or sleep in the open. When the chief decided that it was time to move on the villagers simply struck their tipis, tied the tipi poles to their horses so as to form a [[travois]] for their goods and children, and followed the chief.

On the morning of June 25, Custer divided his 12 companies into three battalions in anticipation of the forthcoming engagement. Three companies were placed under the command of Major [[Marcus Reno]] (A, G, and M) and three were placed under the command of Captain [[Frederick Benteen]] (H, D, and K).

These assumptions were based on inaccurate information provided by the Indian Agents that no more than 800 \"hostiles\" were in the area. The Indian Agents based this estimate on the number of Lakota that Sitting Bull and other leaders had reportedly led off the reservation in protest of U.S. government policies. It was in fact a correct estimate until several weeks before the battle, when the \"reservation Indians\" joined Sitting Bull's ranks for the summer buffalo hunt. The agents did not take into account the many thousands of these \"reservation Indians\" who had unofficially left the reservation to join their \"uncooperative non-reservation cousins led by Sitting Bull\". Thus, Custer unknowingly faced thousands of Indians, including the 800 non-reservation \"hostiles\". All Army plans were based on the incorrect numbers. Although Custer was criticized after the battle for not having accepted reinforcements and for dividing his forces, it appears that he had accepted the same official government estimates of hostiles in the area which Terry and Gibbon had also accepted. Historian James Donovan notes, however, that when Custer later asked interpreter Fred Gerard for his opinion on the size of the opposition, he estimated the force at between 1,500 to 2,500 warriors.<ref>Donovan, loc 3576</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Custer was more concerned with preventing the escape of the Lakota and Cheyenne than with fighting them. From his own observation, as reported by his [[bugle]]r John Martin (Martini),<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Charles Windolph, Frazier Hunt, Robert Hunt, Neil Mangum, ''I Fought with Custer: The Story of Sergeant Windolph, Last Survivor of the Battle of the Little Big Horn: with Explanatory Material and Contemporary Sidelights on the Custer Fight'', University of Nebraska Press, 1987, p. 86.</ref> Custer assumed the warriors had been sleeping in on the morning of the battle, to which virtually every native account attested later, giving Custer a false estimate of what he was up against. When he and his scouts first looked down on the village from the Crow's Nest across the Little Bighorn River, they could only see the herd of ponies. Later, looking from a hill {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} away after parting with Reno's command, Custer could observe only women preparing for the day, and young boys taking thousands of horses out to graze south of the village. Custer's [[Crow scouts]] told him it was the largest native village they had ever seen. When the scouts began changing back into their native dress right before the battle, Custer released them from his command. While the village was enormous in size, Custer still thought there were far fewer warriors to defend the village.\n\nFinally, Custer may have assumed when he encountered the Native Americans, his subordinate Benteen, with the pack train, would provide support. Rifle volleys were a standard way of telling supporting units to come to another unit's aid. In a subsequent official 1879 Army investigation requested by Major Reno, the Reno Board of Inquiry (RCOI), Benteen and Reno's men testified that they heard distinct rifle volleys as late as 4:30&nbsp;pm during the battle.<ref name=\"court of inquiry\">{{cite journal |first=Marcus A. |last=Reno |title=The official record of a court of inquiry convened at Chicago, Illinois, January 13, 1879, by the President of the United States upon the request of Major Marcus A.

He had died a couple of days after the Rosebud battle, and it was the custom of the Indians to move camp when a warrior died and leave the body with its possessions.

[[William W. Cooke]], as Custer's Crow scouts reported Sioux tribe members were alerting the village. Ordered to charge, Reno began that phase of the battle. The orders, made without accurate knowledge of the village's size, location, or the warriors' propensity to stand and fight, had been to pursue the Native Americans and \"bring them to battle.\" Reno's force crossed the Little Bighorn at the mouth of what is today Reno Creek around 3:00&nbsp;pm on June 25. They immediately realized that the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne were present \"in force and not running away.\"\n\nReno advanced rapidly across the open field towards the northwest, his movements masked by the thick bramble of trees that ran along the southern banks of the Little Bighorn River. The same trees on his front right shielded his movements across the wide field over which his men rapidly rode, first with two approximately forty-man companies abreast and eventually with all three charging abreast. The trees also obscured Reno's view of the Native American village until his force had passed that bend on his right front and was suddenly within arrow-shot of the village. The tepees in that area were occupied by the Hunkpapa Sioux. Neither Custer nor Reno had much idea of the length, depth and size of the encampment they were attacking, as the village was hidden by the trees.{{citation needed |date=January 2013}} When Reno came into the open in front of the south end of the village, he sent his Arikara/Ree and Crow Indian scouts forward on his exposed left flank.<ref>{{cite web |author=Running Dog |url= http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/little_sioux_big_horn.html |title=Confirmed by one of his surviving Arikara scouts, Little Sioux |publisher=Astonisher.com |date= |accessdate= 2012-03-15 |url-status = live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120118221826/http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/little_sioux_big_horn.html |archivedate= January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Realizing the full extent of the village's width, Reno quickly suspected what he would later call \"a trap\" and stopped a few hundred yards short of the encampment.\n\nHe ordered his troopers to dismount and deploy in a [[skirmish line]], according to standard army doctrine. In this formation, every fourth trooper held the horses for the troopers in firing position, with five to ten yards separating each trooper, officers to their rear and troopers with horses behind the officers. This formation reduced Reno's firepower by 25 percent. As Reno's men fired into the village and killed, by some accounts, several wives and children of the Sioux leader, [[Gall (Native American leader)|Chief Gall]] (in Lakota, ''Phiz\u00ed''), the mounted warriors began streaming out to meet the attack. With Reno's men anchored on their right by the protection of the tree line and bend in the river, the Indians rode against the center and exposed left end of Reno's line. After about 20 minutes of long-distance firing, Reno had taken only one casualty, but the odds against him had risen (Reno estimated five to one), and Custer had not reinforced him. Trooper Billy Jackson reported that by then, the Indians had begun massing in the open area shielded by a small hill to the left of Reno's line and to the right of the Indian village.<ref>{{cite web |author= Running Dog |url= http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/little_sioux_big_horn.html |title=Little Sioux's Story of the Battle of the Little Bighorn |publisher= Astonisher.com |date= |accessdate= 2012-03-15 |url-status = live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120118221826/http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/little_sioux_big_horn.html |archivedate=January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> From this position the Indians mounted an attack of more than 500 warriors against the left and rear of Reno's line,<ref>Goodrich, Thomas.

The retreat was immediately disrupted by Cheyenne attacks at close quarters. Later, Reno reported that three officers and 29 troopers had been killed during the retreat and subsequent fording of the river. Another officer and 13\u201318 men were missing. Most of these missing men were left behind in the timber, although many eventually rejoined the detachment. Reno's hasty retreat may have been precipitated by the death of Reno's Arikara scout [[Bloody Knife]], who had been shot in the head as he sat on his horse next to Reno.\n\n==== Reno and Benteen on Reno Hill ====\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2013}}\n[[File:Bloody Knife, Custer's scout, on Yellowstone Expedition, 1873 - NARA - 524373.jpg|thumb|[[Bloody Knife]]]]\n\nAtop the bluffs, known today as Reno Hill, Reno's depleted and shaken troops were joined by Captain Benteen's column (Companies D, H and K), arriving from the south. This force had been returning from a lateral scouting mission when it had been summoned by Custer's messenger, Italian bugler John Martin (Giovanni Martini) with the handwritten message \"Benteen. Come on, Big Village, Be quick, Bring packs. P.S. Bring Packs.\"<ref name=\"court of inquiry\" /> Benteen's coincidental arrival on the bluffs was just in time to save Reno's men from possible annihilation. Their detachments were later reinforced by McDougall's Company B and the pack train. The 14 officers and 340 troopers on the bluffs organized an all-around defense and dug rifle pits using whatever implements they had among them, including knives. This practice had become standard during the last year of the American Civil War, with both Union and Confederate troops utilizing knives, eating utensils, mess plates and pans to dig effective battlefield fortifications.<ref>John Keegan, The American Civil War.</ref>\n\n[[File:Www-cgsc.army.mil MAP21 Defense of Reno-Benteen Hill.GIF|thumb|left|Reno\u2013Benteen defensive position]]\n\nDespite hearing heavy gunfire from the north, including distinct volleys at 4:20&nbsp;pm, Benteen concentrated on reinforcing Reno's badly wounded and hard-pressed detachment rather than continuing on toward Custer's position. Benteen's apparent reluctance to reach Custer prompted later criticism that he had failed to follow orders. Around 5:00&nbsp;pm, Capt. [[Thomas Weir (American soldier)|Thomas Weir]] and Company D moved out to make contact with Custer.<ref name=\"court of inquiry\" /> They advanced a mile, to what is today Weir Ridge or Weir Point, and could see in the distance native warriors on horseback shooting at objects on the ground. By this time, roughly 5:25&nbsp;pm, Custer's battle may have concluded. The conventional historical understanding is that what Weir witnessed was most likely warriors killing the wounded soldiers and shooting at dead bodies on the \"Last Stand Hill\" at the northern end of the Custer battlefield. Some contemporary historians have suggested instead that what Weir witnessed was a fight on what is now called Calhoun Hill, some minutes earlier. The destruction of Keogh's battalion may have begun with the collapse of L, I and C Company (half of it) following the combined assaults led by [[Crazy Horse]], [[White Bull (Native American)|White Bull]], Hump, [[Gall (Native American leader)|Chief Gall]] and others.<ref name=\"michno1997\">Michno, Gregory F., ''Lakota Noon, the Indian narrative of Custer's defeat'', Mountain Press, 1997, p 284-285. {{ISBN|0-87842-349-4}}.</ref>{{rp|240}} Other native accounts contradict this understanding, however, and the time element remains a subject of debate. The other entrenched companies eventually left Reno Hill and followed Weir by assigned battalions, first Benteen, then Reno, and finally the pack train. Growing attacks around Weir Ridge by natives coming from the apparently concluded Custer engagement forced all seven companies to return to the bluff before the pack train, with the ammunition, had moved even a quarter mile. The companies remained pinned down on the bluff for another day, but the natives were unable to breach the tightly held position.\n\nBenteen was hit in the heel of his boot by an Indian bullet. At one point, he personally led a counterattack to push back Indians who had continued to crawl through the grass closer to the soldier's positions.<ref>{{cite web |author=Michael Robert Patterson |url= http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wfbentee.htm |title= Frederick William Benteen, Brigadier General, United States Army |publisher= Arlingtoncemetery.net |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15 |url-status = live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120112231108/http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wfbentee.htm |archivedate= January 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Custer's fight ===\n[[File:Custer's last charge.jpg|thumb|Fanciful 1876 illustration of Lieutenant Colonel Custer on horseback and his U.S. Army troops making their last charge at the Battle of the Little Bighorn]]\n\nThe precise details of Custer's fight are largely conjectural since none of the men who went forward with Custer's battalion (the five companies under his immediate command) survived the battle. Later accounts from surviving Indians are useful, but sometimes conflicting and unclear.\n\nWhile the gunfire heard on the bluffs by Reno and Benteen's men during the afternoon of June 25 was probably from Custer's fight, the soldiers on Reno Hill were unaware of what had happened to Custer until General Terry's arrival on June 27. They were reportedly stunned by the news. When the army examined the Custer battle site, soldiers could not determine fully what had transpired. Custer's force of roughly 210 men had been engaged by the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} to the north of Reno and Benteen's defensive position. Evidence of organized resistance included an apparent skirmish line on Calhoun Hill and apparent [[breastworks]] made of dead horses on Custer Hill.<ref name=\"michno1997\" /> By the time troops came to recover the bodies, the Lakota and Cheyenne had already removed most of their dead from the field. The troops found most of Custer's dead men stripped of their clothing, ritually mutilated, and in a state of decomposition, making identification of many impossible.<ref name=\"Brininstool, 60\u201362\">Brininstool, 60\u201362.</ref> The soldiers identified the 7th Cavalry's dead as best as possible and hastily buried them where they fell.\n\nCuster's body was found with two gunshot wounds; one to his left chest and the other to the left temple of his head. Either wound would have been fatal, though he appeared to have bled from only the chest wound, meaning his head wound may have been delivered postmortem. Some Lakota oral histories assert that Custer committed suicide to avoid capture and subsequent torture, though this is usually discounted since the wounds were inconsistent with his known right-handedness.

The route taken by Custer to his \"Last Stand\" remains a subject of debate. One possibility is that after ordering Reno to charge, Custer continued down Reno Creek to within about a half-mile (800&nbsp;m) of the Little Bighorn, but then turned north and climbed up the bluffs, reaching the same spot to which Reno would soon retreat. From this point on the other side of the river, he could see Reno charging the village. Riding north along the bluffs, Custer could have descended into Medicine Tail Coulee. Some historians believe that part of Custer's force descended the coulee, going west to the river and attempting unsuccessfully to cross into the village. According to some accounts, a small contingent of Indian sharpshooters effectively opposed this crossing.\n\n[[File:Battle of the Little Big Horn.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant Colonel Custer and his U.S. Army troops are defeated in battle with Native American Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne on the Little Bighorn Battlefield, June 25, 1876 at Little Bighorn River, Montana]]\n\nWhite Cow Bull claimed to have shot a leader wearing a buckskin jacket off his horse in the river. While no other Indian account supports this claim, if White Bull did shoot a buckskin-clad leader off his horse, some historians have argued that Custer may have been seriously wounded by him. Some Indian accounts claim that besides wounding one of the leaders of this advance, a soldier carrying a company [[Guidon (United States)|guidon]] was also hit.<ref>[http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/white_cow_bull_little_big_horn.html \"White Cow Bull's Story of the Battle of the Little Bighorn #1\"] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080511210009/http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/white_cow_bull_little_big_horn.html |date=May 11, 2008 }}.</ref> Troopers had to dismount to help the wounded men back onto their horses.<ref name=\"michno1997\" />{{rp|117\u201319}} The fact that either of the non-mutilation wounds to Custer's body (a bullet wound below the heart and a shot to the left temple) would have been instantly fatal casts doubt on his being wounded and remounted.<ref>Wert, 1996, p. 355.</ref>\n\nReports of an attempted fording of the river at Medicine Tail Coulee might explain Custer's purpose for Reno's attack, that is, a coordinated \"hammer-and-anvil\" maneuver, with Reno's holding the Indians at bay at the southern end of the camp, while Custer drove them against Reno's line from the north. Other historians have noted that if Custer did attempt to cross the river near Medicine Tail Coulee, he may have believed it was the north end of the Indian camp, only to discover that it was only the middle. Some Indian accounts, however, place the Northern Cheyenne encampment and the north end of the overall village to the left (and south) of the opposite side of the crossing.<ref name=\"michno1997\" />{{rp|10\u201320}} The precise location of the north end of the village remains in dispute, however.\n\n[[File:Custer's route over Little Bighorn battlefield.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Custer's route over battlefield, as theorized by [[Edward S. Curtis|Curtis]]. (Credit: [[Northwestern University Library]] [http://digital.library.northwestern.edu/curtis/ ''Edward S. Curtis's The North American Indian,'' 2003]). ]]\n\n[[Edward S. Curtis|Edward Curtis]], the famed ethnologist and photographer of the Native American Indians, made a detailed personal study of the battle, interviewing many of those who had fought or taken part in it. First he went over the ground covered by the troops with the three Crow scouts [[White Man Runs Him]], [[Goes Ahead]], and [[Hairy Moccasin]], and then again with [[Two Moons]] and a party of Cheyenne warriors. He also visited the Lakota country and interviewed [[Red Hawk (chief)|Red Hawk]], \"whose recollection of the fight seemed to be particularly clear\".<ref name=\"curtis\" />{{rp|44}} Then, he went over the battlefield once more with the three Crow scouts, but also accompanied by General [[Charles Woodruff (general)|Charles Woodruff]] \"as I particularly desired that the testimony of these men might be considered by an experienced army officer\". Finally, Curtis visited the country of the [[Arikara people|Arikara]] and interviewed the scouts of that tribe who had been with Custer's command.<ref name=\"curtis\" />{{rp|44}} Based on all the information he gathered, Curtis concluded that Custer had indeed ridden down the Medicine Tail Coulee and then towards the river where he probably planned to ford it. However, \"the Indians had now discovered him and were gathered closely on the opposite side\".<ref name=\"curtis\" />{{rp|48}} They were soon joined by a large force of Sioux who (no longer engaging Reno) rushed down the valley. This was the beginning of their attack on Custer who was forced to turn and head for the hill where he would make his famous \"last stand\". Thus, wrote Curtis, \"Custer made no attack, the whole movement being a retreat\".<ref name=\"curtis\" />{{rp|49}}\n\n==== Other views of Custer's actions at Minneconjou Ford ====\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2013}}\nOther historians claim that Custer never approached the river, but rather continued north across the coulee and up the other side, where he gradually came under attack. According to this theory, by the time Custer realized he was badly outnumbered, it was too late to break back to the south where Reno and Benteen could have provided assistance. Two men from the 7th Cavalry, the young Crow scout ''Ashishishe'' (known in English as Curley) and the trooper [[Peter Thompson (soldier)|Peter Thompson]], claimed to have seen Custer engage the Indians. The accuracy of their recollections remains controversial; accounts by battle participants and assessments by historians almost universally discredit Thompson's claim.\n\n[[File:Custer's last stand painting.jpg|thumb|\"Custer's Last Stand.\" Lieutenant Colonel Custer standing center, wearing buckskin, with few of his soldiers of the 7th Cavalry still standing.]]\n\nArchaeological evidence and reassessment of Indian testimony has led to a new interpretation of the battle. In the 1920s, battlefield investigators discovered hundreds of .45\u201355 shell cases along the ridge line known today as Nye-Cartwright Ridge, between South Medicine Tail Coulee and the next drainage at North Medicine Tail (also known as Deep Coulee). Some historians believe Custer divided his detachment into two (and possibly three) battalions, retaining personal command of one while presumably delegating Captain George W. Yates to command the second.\n\nEvidence from the 1920s supports the theory that at least one of the companies made a feint attack southeast from Nye-Cartwright Ridge straight down the center of the \"V\" formed by the intersection at the crossing of Medicine Tail Coulee on the right and Calhoun Coulee on the left. The intent may have been to relieve pressure on Reno's detachment (according to the Crow scout Curley, possibly viewed by both Mitch Bouyer and Custer) by withdrawing the skirmish line into the timber on the edge of the Little Bighorn River. Had the U.S. troops come straight down Medicine Tail Coulee, their approach to the Minneconjou Crossing and the northern area of the village would have been masked by the high ridges running on the northwest side of the Little Bighorn River.\n\nThat they might have come southeast, from the center of Nye-Cartwright Ridge, seems to be supported by Northern Cheyenne accounts of seeing the approach of the distinctly white-colored horses of Company E, known as the Grey Horse Company. Its approach was seen by Indians at that end of the village. Behind them, a second company, further up on the heights, would have provided long-range cover fire. Warriors could have been drawn to the feint attack, forcing the battalion back towards the heights, up the north fork drainage, away from the troops providing cover fire above. The covering company would have moved towards a reunion, delivering heavy [[volley fire]] and leaving the trail of expended cartridges discovered 50 years later.\n\n=== Last stand ===\n[[File:Edgar Samuel Paxson - Custer's Last Stand.jpg|thumb|''Custer's Last Stand'' by [[Edgar Samuel Paxson]]]]\nIn the end, the hilltop to which Custer had moved was probably too small to accommodate all of the survivors and wounded. Fire from the southeast made it impossible for Custer's men to secure a defensive position all around Last Stand Hill where the soldiers put up their most dogged defense. According to Lakota accounts, far more of their casualties occurred in the attack on Last Stand Hill than anywhere else. The extent of the soldiers' resistance indicated they had few doubts about their prospects for survival. According to Cheyenne and Sioux testimony, the command structure rapidly broke down, although smaller \"last stands\" were apparently made by several groups. Custer's remaining companies (E, F, and half of C) were soon killed.\n\nBy almost all accounts, the Lakota annihilated Custer's force within an hour of engagement.<ref>Miller, David Humphreys, ''Custer's Fall'', Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 1985, pg 158</ref><ref>Graham, Benteen letter to Capt.

Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 1985 (reprint of 1957 edition), p. 158.</ref> Other native accounts said the fighting lasted only \"as long as it takes a hungry man to eat a meal.\" The Lakota asserted that Crazy Horse personally led one of the large groups of warriors who overwhelmed the cavalrymen in a surprise charge from the northeast, causing a breakdown in the command structure and panic among the troops. Many of these men threw down their weapons while Cheyenne and Sioux warriors rode them down, \"[[counting coup]]\" with lances, coup sticks, and [[quirt]]s. Some Native accounts recalled this segment of the fight as a \"buffalo run.\"<ref>Graham, pp. 45\u201356.</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Frederick William Benteen|Frederick Benteen]], battalion leader of Companies D, H and K, recalled his observations on the Custer battlefield on June 27, 1876\n\n{{quote|I went over the battlefield carefully with a view to determine how the battle was fought.

This left about 50-60 men, mostly from F Company and the staff, on Last Stand Hill. The remainder of the battle took on the nature of a running fight. Modern archaeology and historical Indian accounts indicate that Custer's force may have been divided into three groups, with the Indians attempting to prevent them from effectively reuniting. Indian accounts describe warriors (including women) running up from the village to wave blankets in order to scare off the soldiers' horses. One 7th Cavalry trooper claimed finding a number of stone ''mallets'' consisting of a round cobble weighing 8\u201310 pounds (about 4&nbsp;kg) with a rawhide handle, which he believed had been used by the Indian women to finish off the wounded.<ref name=Scott-TheyDied>{{cite book |title=They Died With Custer: Soldiers' Bones from the Battle of the Little Bighorn |first1=Douglas D. |last1=Scott |first2=P. |last2=Willey |first3=Melissa A. |last3=Connor |location=Norman |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=2013 |orig-year=1998 |url={{GBurl|id=KO-9A4b2t4IC}} |isbn=978-0-8061-3507-7 |ignore-isbn-error=yes}}</ref>{{rp|314}} Fighting dismounted, the soldiers' skirmish lines were overwhelmed. Army doctrine would have called for one man in four to be a horseholder behind the skirmish lines and, in extreme cases, one man in eight. Later, the troops would have bunched together in defensive positions and are alleged to have shot their remaining horses as cover. As individual troopers were wounded or killed, initial defensive positions would have been abandoned as untenable.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Gray, John C. \"Custer's Last Campaign\"</ref>\n\nUnder threat of attack, the first U.S. soldiers on the battlefield three days later hurriedly buried the troopers in shallow graves, more or less where they had fallen. A couple of years after the battle, markers were placed where men were believed to have fallen, so the placement of troops has been roughly construed. The troops evidently died in several groups, including on Custer Hill, around Captain [[Myles Keogh]], and strung out towards the Little Bighorn River.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n==== Last break-out attempt ====\n[[File:2008 0909Battlefield0026.JPG|thumb|[[Mitch Bouyer]] marker on Deep Ravine trail.

Instead, archaeologists suggest that in the end, Custer's troops were not surrounded but rather overwhelmed by a single charge. This scenario corresponds to several Indian accounts stating Crazy Horse's charge swarmed the resistance, with the surviving soldiers fleeing in panic.<ref name=\"michno1997\" /><ref group=\"note\">Testimony of Yellow Nose.</ref> Many of these troopers may have ended up in a deep ravine 300\u2013400 yards away from what is known today as Custer Hill.

According to Scott, it is likely that in the 108 years between the battle and Scott's excavation efforts in the ravine, geological processes caused many of the remains to become unrecoverable. For example, near the town of Garryowen, portions of the skeleton of a trooper killed in the Reno Retreat were recovered from an eroding bank of the Little Big Horn, while the rest of the remains had apparently been washed away by the river.<ref name=Scott-TheyDied/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width =350\n| image1    = 18760706 Indian War - The Helena Independent.png\n| alt1      = \n| width1    = \n| caption1  = This Helena, Montana newspaper article did not report the June 25 battle until July 6, referring to a July 3 story from a Bozeman, Montana newspaper\u2014itself eight days after the event.<ref name=HelenaIndependent_18760706>{{cite news |title=Indian War / Gen.

The Great Sioux War ended on May 7 with Miles' defeat of a remaining band of [[Miniconjou]] Sioux.<ref name=\"sonofthesouth.net\" />\n\nOwnership of the [[Black Hills]], which had been a focal point of the 1876 conflict, was determined by an ultimatum issued by the [[Manypenny Agreement|Manypenny Commission]], according to which the Sioux were required to cede the land to the United States if they wanted the government to continue supplying rations to the reservations. Threatened with forced starvation, the Natives ceded ''[[Paha Sapa]]'' to the United States,<ref>Welch, James A & Steckler, Paul (1994), ''Killing Custer \u2013 The Battle of the Little Bighorn and the Fate of the Plains Indians'', New York: Penguin Books: pp. 196\u201397.</ref> but the Sioux never accepted the legitimacy of the transaction. They lobbied Congress to create a forum to decide their claim and subsequently litigated for 40 years; the United States Supreme Court in the 1980 decision [[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians]] acknowledged<ref group=\"note\">According to ''United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians'', 448 U.S. 371 (1980), the US government had to pay just compensation and interest to the Sioux for taking the Black Hills. This case confirmed the court's view that the government can treat Indian reservations like private property and take them by [[eminent domain]] if just compensation is paid.</ref> that the United States had taken the Black Hills without just compensation. The Sioux [[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians#Legal Analysis|refused the money subsequently offered]] and continue to insist on their right to occupy the land.\n\n== Participants ==\n=== 7th Cavalry officers ===\n[[File:Soldier memorial little bighorn 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|140px|Memorial Marker as seen from the east]]\n[[File:Soldier memorial little bighorn 3.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|140px|Memorial Marker plaque]]\n[[File:Soldier memorial little bighorn 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|140px|Memorial Marker as seen from the west]]\n[[File:Where custer fell little big horn.jpg|thumb|right|Marker indicating where General Custer fell among soldiers \u2013 denoted with black-face, in center of photo]]\n* Commanding Officer: Lt.

Otis of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry]] was promoted to replace Custer effective June 25, 1876, but did not report until February 1877. Two 1876 West Point graduates designated for the 7th Cavalry were advanced to 1st lieutenant effective 10 days after their graduation. Four others appointed to other regiments, along with eight experienced 2nd lieutenants, were transferred and designated one to each company of the 7th. However, five declined the appointment, replaced by 2nd lieutenants of infantry and unappointed new officers in July and August 1876. Only three replacements were able to report while the 7th was still in the field.</ref> and recruiting efforts began to fill the depleted ranks. The regiment, reorganized into eight companies, remained in the field as part of the Terry Expedition, now based on the Yellowstone River at the mouth of the Bighorn and reinforced by Gibbon's column. On August 8, 1876, after Terry was further reinforced with the 5th Infantry, the expedition moved up Rosebud Creek in pursuit of the Lakota. It met with Crook's command, similarly reinforced, and the combined force, almost 4,000 strong, followed the Lakota trail northeast toward the [[Little Missouri River (North Dakota)|Little Missouri River]]. Persistent rain and lack of supplies forced the column to dissolve and return to its varying starting points. The 7th Cavalry returned to Fort Abraham Lincoln to reconstitute. The regimental commander, Colonel [[Samuel D. Sturgis]], returned from his detached duty in St. Louis, Missouri. Sturgis led the 7th Cavalry in the campaign against the [[Nez Perce War|Nez Perce]] in 1877.\n\n=== Expansion of the U.S. Army ===\nThe U.S. Congress authorized appropriations to expand the Army by 2,500 men to meet the emergency after the defeat of the 7th Cavalry. For a session, the Democratic Party-controlled House of Representatives abandoned its campaign to reduce the size of the Army. Word of Custer's fate reached the 44th United States Congress as a conference committee was attempting to reconcile opposing appropriations bills approved by the House and the Republican Senate. They approved a measure to increase the size of cavalry companies to 100 enlisted men on July 24. The committee temporarily lifted the ceiling on the size of the Army by 2,500 on August 15.<ref>Utley, Robert M.

The court found Reno's conduct to be without fault. After the battle, Thomas Rosser, James O'Kelly, and others continued to question the conduct of Reno due to his hastily ordered retreat.<ref>Donovan, James (2008).

Contemporary accounts also point to the fact that Reno's scout, Bloody Knife, was shot in the head, spraying him with blood, possibly increasing his own panic and distress.<ref name=\"Fox1993\" />\n\n=== Custer's errors ===\nGeneral Terry and others claimed that Custer made strategic errors from the start of the campaign. For instance, he refused to use a battery of Gatling guns, and turned down General Terry's offer of an additional battalion of the 2nd Cavalry. Custer believed that the Gatling guns would impede his march up the Rosebud and hamper his mobility. His rapid march en route to the Little Bighorn averaged nearly {{convert|30|mi|km}} a day, so his assessment appears to have been accurate. Custer planned \"to live and travel like Indians; in this manner the command will be able to go wherever the Indians can\", he wrote in his ''Herald'' dispatch.<ref name=\"Donovan 2008\">Donovan (2008).

Each of the heavy, hand-cranked weapons could fire up to 350 rounds a minute, an impressive rate, but they were known to jam frequently. During the [[Black Hills Expedition]] two years earlier, a Gatling gun had turned over, rolled down a mountain, and shattered to pieces.

At the same time, a House committee was busy debating a new appropriations bill that required a major reorganization of the army. \"Reduction of expenses\" was emphasized. One proposal would lop off entire regiments, including two cavalry regiments. Another would set the line officers (those in the field) from Major down back a few years in the promotion schedule. The total reduction in officers was proposed to be 406, almost 25 percent of the total. The military strongly wanted to avoid confirmation of incompetency or cowardice \u2013 rumors of which were circulating around the impending court of inquiry in Chicago. Donovan (2008).

Gallear's analysis minimizes the allegation that rapid depletion of ammunition in lever-action models influenced the decision in favor of the single-shot Springfield. The [[American Indian Wars|Indian War]], in this context, appears as a minor theatre of conflict, whose contingencies were unlikely to govern the selection of standard weaponry for an emerging industrialized nation.<ref>Gallear, 2001: \"The established wisdom is that the U.S. Army did not adopt lever-action multiple shot weapons during the Civil War because of the problems they would create regarding the supply of ammunition. However, I believe that by the time of the Indian Wars the Army viewed the lever-actions weapons as under-powered novelty weapons and that they were equipping their men to fight wars against European equipped enemies or to re-fight the Civil War. The Indian Wars were seen as a minor sideshow in which troops armed to fight on European battlefields would be more than a match for fighting any number of Indians.</ref>\n\nThe Springfield carbine is praised for its \"superior range and stopping power\" by historian James Donovan, and author Charles M. Robinson reports that the rifle could be \"loaded and fired much more rapidly than its muzzle loading predecessors, and had twice the range of repeating rifles such as the Winchester, Henry and Spencer.\"<ref>Donovan, 2008, p. 191: \"...a solid weapon with superior range and stopping power...\"</ref><ref>Robinson, 1995, p. xxviii</ref><ref>Gallear, 2001: \"The Army saw breech-loading rifles and carbines as the way forward. They could fire a much more powerful round at longer ranges than lever-actions.\"</ref>\n\nGallear points out that lever-action rifles, after a burst of rapid discharge, still required a reloading interlude that lowered their overall rate of fire; Springfield breechloaders \"in the long run, had a higher rate of fire, which was sustainable throughout a battle.\"<ref>Gallear, 2001</ref>\n\nThe breechloader design patent for the Springfield's Erskine S. Allin [[Single-shot#Trapdoor actions|trapdoor system]] was owned by the US government and the firearm could be easily adapted for production with existing machinery at the [[Springfield Armory]] in Massachusetts.<ref>Gallear, 2001: \"The Allin System had been developed at the Government Armories to reduce the cost, but the U.S. Treasury had already been forced to pay $124,000 to inventors whose patents it infringed. The adoption of the Allin breech gave the advantages of being already familiar throughout the Army, involved no more royalties, and existing machinery at the Springfield Armory could easily be adapted to its manufacture.</ref> At time when funding for the post-war Army had been slashed, the prospect for economical production influenced the Ordnance Board member selection of the Springfield option.<ref>Donovan, 2008, p. 191: \"Army appropriations were at an all-time low, and a key factor in the Springfield's favor was its low production cost.\"</ref>\n\n==== Malfunction of the Springfield carbine extractor mechanism ====\nThe question as to whether the reported malfunction of the Model 1873 Springfield carbine issued to the 7th Cavalry contributed to their defeat has been debated for years.<ref>Gallear, 2001: \"...some authorities have blamed the gun's reliability and tendency for rounds to jam in the breech for the defeat at the Little Bighorn..\"</ref>\n\nThat the weapon experienced jamming of the extractor is not contested, but its contribution to Custer's defeat is considered negligible. This conclusion is supported by evidence from archaeological studies performed at the battlefield, where the recovery of Springfield cartridge casing, bearing tell-tale scratch marks indicating manual extraction, were rare.\nThe flaw in the ejector mechanism was known to the Army Ordnance Board at the time of the selection of the Model 1873 rifle and carbine, and was not considered a significant shortcoming in the overall worthiness of the shoulder arm.<ref>Hatch, 1997, p. 124: \"This defect was noted by the board of officers (which included Major Reno) that selected the weapon in 1872, but was not considered particularly serious at the time.\"</ref> With the ejector failure in US Army tests as low as 1:300, the Springfield carbine was vastly more reliable than the muzzle-loading Springfields used in the Civil War.<ref>Gallear, 2001: \"A study of .45-55 cases found at the battle concludes that extractor failure amounted to less than 0.35% of some 1,751 cases tested...the carbine was in fact more reliable than anything that had preceded it in U.S. Army service. These weapons were vastly more reliable than the muzzle-loading weapons of the Civil War, which would frequently misfire and cause the soldier to uselessly load multiple rounds on top of each other in the heat of battle.</ref><ref>Hatch, 1997, p. 124: 'Scholars have for years debated the issue of whether or not the Model 1873 Springfield carbine carried by cavalrymen, malfunctioned during the battle and [whether this] was one reason for the defeat\" and \"No definitive conclusion can be drawn [as to] the possible malfunction...as being a significant cause of Custer's defeat. Writers of both pro- and anti-Custer material over the years...have incorporated the theory into their works...\"</ref>\n\nGallear addresses the post-battle testimony concerning the copper .45-55 cartridges supplied to the troops in which an officer is said to have cleared the chambers of spent cartridges for a number of Springfield carbines.<ref>Donovan, 2008, p. 440: footnote, \"the carbine extractor problem did exist, though it probably had little impact on the outcome of the battle. DeRudio testified that 'the men had to take their knives to extract cartridges after firing 6 to 10 rounds.'...but 'the men' seems to have been an exaggeration. Private Daniel Newall mentioned the problem...\"</ref> This testimony of widespread fusing of the casings offered to the Chief of Ordnance at the Reno Court of Inquiry in 1879 conflicts with the archaeological evidence collected at the battlefield. Field data showed that possible extractor failures occurred at a rate of approximately 1:30 firings at the Custer Battlefield and at a rate of 1:37 at the Reno-Benteen Battlefield.<ref>Hatch, 1997, p. 124: \"The controversy results from the known failure of the carbine to [eject] the spent .45-55 caliber cartridge [casings]. The cartridge cases were made of copper, which expands when hot. That \u2013 coupled with a faulty extractor mechanism and dirt \u2013 could cause the head of the cartridge to be torn away when the block was opened, and the cartridge cylinder would then be left inside the chamber...The casings would have to be removed manually with a pocketknife before [reloading and] firing again. This defect was noted by the board of officers (which included Major Reno) that selected the weapon in 1872, but was not considered particularly serious at the time.\"</ref><ref>Hatch, 1997, p. 124: \"How often did this defect [ejector failure] occur and cause the [Springfield carbines] to malfunction on June 25, 1876? According to Dr. Richard Fox in ''Archeology, History and Custer's Last Battle'' (1993), there were very few .45-55 caliber cartridge casings found during the digs on the battlefield that showed any evidence to pry or scratch marks [indicating manual extraction]. Only 3 of 88 [3.4%] found on the Custer [battalion] portion of the battlefield could possibly have been removed in an extraction jam. On the Reno-Benteen defense site [Reno Hill], 7 of 257 fit this category [2.7%]. If this was a representative number it would appear that malfunction from that source was minimal.\"</ref><ref>Hatch, 1997, p. 124: \"Both sides [troopers and Indians] apparently believed that some weapons malfunctioned. Indian testimony...reported that some soldiers threw down their long guns and fought with their short guns. Could this indicate a malfunctioning [carbine] that was discarded and therefore could not have left its marked [pry scratched] casings on the field? ... No definitive conclusion can be drawn about the possible malfunction...as being a significant cause of Custer's defeat. Writers of both pro- and anti-Custer material over the years...have incorporated the theory into their works...\"</ref>\n\nHistorian Thom Hatch observes that the Model 1873 Springfield, despite the known ejector flaw, remained the standard issue shoulder arm for US troops until the early 1890s.<ref>Hatch, 1997, p. 124: \"On a final note: the Springfield carbine remained the official cavalry firearm until the early 1890s\"</ref> when the copper-cased, inside-primed cartridges were replaced with brass.\n\n== Survivor claims ==\n[[File:Giovanni Martini (militare).jpg|thumb|John Martin wearing the US Army uniform, ca. 1904]]\n\nSoldiers under Custer's direct command were annihilated on the first day of the battle (except for three [[Crow scouts]] and several troopers (including [[Giovanni Martino|John Martin (Giovanni Martino)]]) that had left that column before the battle; one Crow scout, [[Curly (scout)|Curly]], was the only survivor to leave after the battle had begun), although for years rumors persisted of other survivors.<ref group=\"note\">Graham, 146.

[[Theodore Goldin]], a battle participant who later became a controversial historian on the event, wrote (in regards to Charles Hayward's claim to have been with Custer and taken prisoner):\n\n<blockquote> The Indians always insisted that they took no prisoners. If they did\u2014a thing I firmly believe\u2014they were tortured and killed the night of the 25th. As an evidence of this I recall the three charred and burned heads we picked up in the village near the scene of the big war dance, when we visited the village with Capt. Benteen and Lieut. Wallace on the morning of the 27th... I'm sorely afraid, Tony, that we will have to class Hayward's story, like that of so many others, as pure, unadulterated B. S. As a clerk at headquarters I had occasion to look over the morning reports of at least the six troops at Lincoln almost daily, and never saw his name there, or among the list of scouts employed from time to time ... I am hoping that some day all of these damned fakirs will die and it will be safe for actual participants in the battle to admit and insist that they were there, without being branded and looked upon as a lot of damned liars. Actually, there have been times when I have been tempted to deny that I ever heard of the 7th Cavalry, much less participated with it in that engagement ...

In 1946, it was re-designated as the ''Custer Battlefield [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]]'', reflecting its association with Custer. In 1967, Major Marcus Reno was re-interred in the cemetery with honors, including an eleven-gun salute. Beginning in the early 1970s, there was concern within the [[National Park Service]] over the name Custer Battlefield National Monument failing to adequately reflect the larger history of the battle between two cultures. Hearings on the name change were held in [[Billings, Montana|Billings]] on June 10, 1991, and during the following months Congress renamed the site the ''Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument''.\n\nUnited States memorialization of the battlefield began in 1879 with a temporary monument to the U.S. dead. In 1881, the current marble obelisk was erected in their honor. In 1890, marble blocks were added to mark the places where the U.S. cavalry soldiers fell.\n\nNearly 100 years later, ideas about the meaning of the battle have become more inclusive. The United States government acknowledged that Native American sacrifices also deserved recognition at the site. The 1991 bill changing the name of the national monument also authorized an Indian Memorial to be built near Last Stand Hill in honor of Lakota and Cheyenne warriors. The commissioned work by native artist [[Colleen Cutschall]] is shown in the photograph at right. On Memorial Day 1999, in consultation with tribal representatives, the U.S. added two red granite markers to the battlefield to note where Native American warriors fell. As of December 2006, a total of ten warrior markers have been added (three at the Reno\u2013Benteen Defense Site and seven on the Little Bighorn Battlefield).<ref>National Park Service website for the Little Bighorn Battlefield.</ref>\n\nThe Indian Memorial, themed \"Peace Through Unity\" l is an open circular structure that stands {{convert|75|yd|abbr=off}} from the 7th Cavalry obelisk.

Many men were veterans of the war, including most of the leading officers.

Six other troopers had died of drowning and 51 in [[cholera]] epidemics. In November 1868, while stationed in Kansas, the 7th Cavalry under Custer had successfully routed [[Black Kettle]]'s Southern Cheyenne camp on the [[Washita River]] in the [[Battle of Washita River]], an attack which was at the time labeled a \"massacre of innocent Indians\" by the [[Indian Bureau]].<ref>[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/218456/pdf Washita Memories: Eyewitness Views of Custer's Attack on Black Kettle's Village (review)], ''[[Project Muse]]'', James T.

About 20% of the troopers had been enlisted in the prior seven months (139 of an enlisted roll of 718), were only marginally trained and had no combat or frontier experience. A sizable number of these recruits were immigrants from Ireland, Britain and Germany, just as many of the veteran troopers had been before their enlistments.

Surprised and according to some accounts astonished by the unusually large numbers of Native Americans, Crook held the field at the end of the battle but felt compelled by his losses to pull back, regroup, and wait for reinforcements. Unaware of Crook's battle, Gibbon and Terry proceeded, joining forces in early June near the mouth of [[Rosebud Creek]]. They reviewed Terry's plan calling for Custer's regiment to proceed south along the Rosebud while Terry and Gibbon's united forces would move in a westerly direction toward the [[Bighorn River|Bighorn]] and [[Little Bighorn River|Little Bighorn]] rivers. As this was the likely location of native encampments, all army elements had been instructed to converge there around June 26 or 27 in an attempt to engulf the Native Americans. On June 22, Terry ordered the 7th Cavalry, composed of 31 officers and 566 enlisted men under Custer, to begin a reconnaissance in force and pursuit along the Rosebud, with the prerogative to \"depart\" from orders if Custer saw \"sufficient reason\".

At sunrise on June 25, Custer's scouts reported they could see a massive pony herd and signs of the Native American village{{refn|group=\"note\"|[[Plains Indians]] were semi-nomadic peoples and had no permanent settlements off the [[Indian reservation|reservations]] (aka \"Agencies).  A \"village\" was a collection of [[tipis]], housing a group of Indians under the leadership of a chief, including those of tribes other than the chief's. A village would be created wherever a group stopped by simply erecting the tipis and could last from a single night to several weeks. Young warriors without a tipi would generally create [[lean-tos]] or sleep in the open. When the chief decided that it was time to move on the villagers simply struck their tipis, tied the tipi poles to their horses so as to form a [[travois]] for their goods and children, and followed the chief.  The term \"village\", therefore, refers to the group while moving OR encamped.<ref>Philbrick, Nathaniel, ''The Last Stand: Custer, Sitting Bull, and the Battle of the Little Bighorn'', Viking, 2010, pgs 102, 106, eISBN 978-1-101-19011-1</ref>}} roughly {{convert|15|mi|km}} in the distance.

''Editorial Galaxia''. 2001, p. 272.</ref> Assuming his presence had been exposed, Custer decided to attack the village without further delay. On the morning of June 25, Custer divided his 12 companies into three battalions in anticipation of the forthcoming engagement. Three companies were placed under the command of Major [[Marcus Reno]] (A, G, and M) and three were placed under the command of Captain [[Frederick Benteen]] (H, D, and K). Five companies (C, E, F, I, and L) remained under Custer's immediate command.

These assumptions were based on inaccurate information provided by the Indian Agents that no more than 800 \"hostiles\" were in the area. The Indian Agents based this estimate on the number of Lakota that Sitting Bull and other leaders had reportedly led off the reservation in protest of U.S. government policies. It was in fact a correct estimate until several weeks before the battle, when the \"reservation Indians\" joined Sitting Bull's ranks for the summer buffalo hunt. The agents did not take into account the many thousands of these \"reservation Indians\" who had unofficially left the reservation to join their \"uncooperative non-reservation cousins led by Sitting Bull\". Thus, Custer unknowingly faced thousands of Indians, including the 800 non-reservation \"hostiles\". All Army plans were based on the incorrect numbers. Although Custer was criticized after the battle for not having accepted reinforcements and for dividing his forces, it appears that he had accepted the same official government estimates of hostiles in the area which Terry and Gibbon had also accepted. Historian James Donovan notes, however, that when Custer later asked interpreter Fred Gerard for his opinion on the size of the opposition, he estimated the force at between 1,500 to 2,500 warriors.<ref>Donovan, loc 3576</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Custer was more concerned with preventing the escape of the Lakota and Cheyenne than with fighting them. From his own observation, as reported by his [[bugle]]r John Martin (Martini),<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Charles Windolph, Frazier Hunt, Robert Hunt, Neil Mangum, ''I Fought with Custer: The Story of Sergeant Windolph, Last Survivor of the Battle of the Little Big Horn: with Explanatory Material and Contemporary Sidelights on the Custer Fight'', University of Nebraska Press, 1987, p. 86.</ref> Custer assumed the warriors had been sleeping in on the morning of the battle, to which virtually every native account attested later, giving Custer a false estimate of what he was up against. When he and his scouts first looked down on the village from the Crow's Nest across the Little Bighorn River, they could only see the herd of ponies. Later, looking from a hill {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} away after parting with Reno's command, Custer could observe only women preparing for the day, and young boys taking thousands of horses out to graze south of the village. Custer's [[Crow scouts]] told him it was the largest native village they had ever seen. When the scouts began changing back into their native dress right before the battle, Custer released them from his command. While the village was enormous in size, Custer still thought there were far fewer warriors to defend the village.\n\nFinally, Custer may have assumed when he encountered the Native Americans, his subordinate Benteen, with the pack train, would provide support. Rifle volleys were a standard way of telling supporting units to come to another unit's aid. In a subsequent official 1879 Army investigation requested by Major Reno, the Reno Board of Inquiry (RCOI), Benteen and Reno's men testified that they heard distinct rifle volleys as late as 4:30&nbsp;pm during the battle.<ref name=\"court of inquiry\">{{cite journal |first=Marcus A. |last=Reno |title=The official record of a court of inquiry convened at Chicago, Illinois, January 13, 1879, by the President of the United States upon the request of Major Marcus A.

The Indians had left a single [[teepee]] standing (some reports mention a second that had been partially dismantled), and in it was the body of a [[Sans Arc]] warrior, Old She-Bear, who had been wounded in the battle. He had died a couple of days after the Rosebud battle, and it was the custom of the Indians to move camp when a warrior died and leave the body with its possessions.

[[William W. Cooke]], as Custer's Crow scouts reported Sioux tribe members were alerting the village. Ordered to charge, Reno began that phase of the battle. The orders, made without accurate knowledge of the village's size, location, or the warriors' propensity to stand and fight, had been to pursue the Native Americans and \"bring them to battle.\" Reno's force crossed the Little Bighorn at the mouth of what is today Reno Creek around 3:00&nbsp;pm on June 25. They immediately realized that the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne were present \"in force and not running away.\"\n\nReno advanced rapidly across the open field towards the northwest, his movements masked by the thick bramble of trees that ran along the southern banks of the Little Bighorn River. The same trees on his front right shielded his movements across the wide field over which his men rapidly rode, first with two approximately forty-man companies abreast and eventually with all three charging abreast. The trees also obscured Reno's view of the Native American village until his force had passed that bend on his right front and was suddenly within arrow-shot of the village. The tepees in that area were occupied by the Hunkpapa Sioux. Neither Custer nor Reno had much idea of the length, depth and size of the encampment they were attacking, as the village was hidden by the trees.{{citation needed |date=January 2013}} When Reno came into the open in front of the south end of the village, he sent his Arikara/Ree and Crow Indian scouts forward on his exposed left flank.<ref>{{cite web |author=Running Dog |url= http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/little_sioux_big_horn.html |title=Confirmed by one of his surviving Arikara scouts, Little Sioux |publisher=Astonisher.com |date= |accessdate= 2012-03-15 |url-status = live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120118221826/http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/little_sioux_big_horn.html |archivedate= January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Realizing the full extent of the village's width, Reno quickly suspected what he would later call \"a trap\" and stopped a few hundred yards short of the encampment.\n\nHe ordered his troopers to dismount and deploy in a [[skirmish line]], according to standard army doctrine. In this formation, every fourth trooper held the horses for the troopers in firing position, with five to ten yards separating each trooper, officers to their rear and troopers with horses behind the officers. This formation reduced Reno's firepower by 25 percent. As Reno's men fired into the village and killed, by some accounts, several wives and children of the Sioux leader, [[Gall (Native American leader)|Chief Gall]] (in Lakota, ''Phiz\u00ed''), the mounted warriors began streaming out to meet the attack. With Reno's men anchored on their right by the protection of the tree line and bend in the river, the Indians rode against the center and exposed left end of Reno's line. After about 20 minutes of long-distance firing, Reno had taken only one casualty, but the odds against him had risen (Reno estimated five to one), and Custer had not reinforced him. Trooper Billy Jackson reported that by then, the Indians had begun massing in the open area shielded by a small hill to the left of Reno's line and to the right of the Indian village.<ref>{{cite web |author= Running Dog |url= http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/little_sioux_big_horn.html |title=Little Sioux's Story of the Battle of the Little Bighorn |publisher= Astonisher.com |date= |accessdate= 2012-03-15 |url-status = live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120118221826/http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/little_sioux_big_horn.html |archivedate=January 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> From this position the Indians mounted an attack of more than 500 warriors against the left and rear of Reno's line,<ref>Goodrich, Thomas.

The retreat was immediately disrupted by Cheyenne attacks at close quarters. Later, Reno reported that three officers and 29 troopers had been killed during the retreat and subsequent fording of the river. Another officer and 13\u201318 men were missing. Most of these missing men were left behind in the timber, although many eventually rejoined the detachment. Reno's hasty retreat may have been precipitated by the death of Reno's Arikara scout [[Bloody Knife]], who had been shot in the head as he sat on his horse next to Reno.\n\n==== Reno and Benteen on Reno Hill ====\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2013}}\n[[File:Bloody Knife, Custer's scout, on Yellowstone Expedition, 1873 - NARA - 524373.jpg|thumb|[[Bloody Knife]]]]\n\nAtop the bluffs, known today as Reno Hill, Reno's depleted and shaken troops were joined by Captain Benteen's column (Companies D, H and K), arriving from the south. This force had been returning from a lateral scouting mission when it had been summoned by Custer's messenger, Italian bugler John Martin (Giovanni Martini) with the handwritten message \"Benteen. Come on, Big Village, Be quick, Bring packs. P.S. Bring Packs.\"<ref name=\"court of inquiry\" /> Benteen's coincidental arrival on the bluffs was just in time to save Reno's men from possible annihilation. Their detachments were later reinforced by McDougall's Company B and the pack train. The 14 officers and 340 troopers on the bluffs organized an all-around defense and dug rifle pits using whatever implements they had among them, including knives. This practice had become standard during the last year of the American Civil War, with both Union and Confederate troops utilizing knives, eating utensils, mess plates and pans to dig effective battlefield fortifications.<ref>John Keegan, The American Civil War.</ref>\n\n[[File:Www-cgsc.army.mil MAP21 Defense of Reno-Benteen Hill.GIF|thumb|left|Reno\u2013Benteen defensive position]]\n\nDespite hearing heavy gunfire from the north, including distinct volleys at 4:20&nbsp;pm, Benteen concentrated on reinforcing Reno's badly wounded and hard-pressed detachment rather than continuing on toward Custer's position. Benteen's apparent reluctance to reach Custer prompted later criticism that he had failed to follow orders. Around 5:00&nbsp;pm, Capt. [[Thomas Weir (American soldier)|Thomas Weir]] and Company D moved out to make contact with Custer.<ref name=\"court of inquiry\" /> They advanced a mile, to what is today Weir Ridge or Weir Point, and could see in the distance native warriors on horseback shooting at objects on the ground. By this time, roughly 5:25&nbsp;pm, Custer's battle may have concluded. The conventional historical understanding is that what Weir witnessed was most likely warriors killing the wounded soldiers and shooting at dead bodies on the \"Last Stand Hill\" at the northern end of the Custer battlefield. Some contemporary historians have suggested instead that what Weir witnessed was a fight on what is now called Calhoun Hill, some minutes earlier. The destruction of Keogh's battalion may have begun with the collapse of L, I and C Company (half of it) following the combined assaults led by [[Crazy Horse]], [[White Bull (Native American)|White Bull]], Hump, [[Gall (Native American leader)|Chief Gall]] and others.<ref name=\"michno1997\">Michno, Gregory F., ''Lakota Noon, the Indian narrative of Custer's defeat'', Mountain Press, 1997, p 284-285. {{ISBN|0-87842-349-4}}.</ref>{{rp|240}} Other native accounts contradict this understanding, however, and the time element remains a subject of debate. The other entrenched companies eventually left Reno Hill and followed Weir by assigned battalions, first Benteen, then Reno, and finally the pack train. Growing attacks around Weir Ridge by natives coming from the apparently concluded Custer engagement forced all seven companies to return to the bluff before the pack train, with the ammunition, had moved even a quarter mile. The companies remained pinned down on the bluff for another day, but the natives were unable to breach the tightly held position.\n\nBenteen was hit in the heel of his boot by an Indian bullet. At one point, he personally led a counterattack to push back Indians who had continued to crawl through the grass closer to the soldier's positions.<ref>{{cite web |author=Michael Robert Patterson |url= http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wfbentee.htm |title= Frederick William Benteen, Brigadier General, United States Army |publisher= Arlingtoncemetery.net |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15 |url-status = live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120112231108/http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wfbentee.htm |archivedate= January 12, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Custer's fight ===\n[[File:Custer's last charge.jpg|thumb|Fanciful 1876 illustration of Lieutenant Colonel Custer on horseback and his U.S. Army troops making their last charge at the Battle of the Little Bighorn]]\n[[File:Crow Indian Reservation, 1868 (area 619 and 635).

Later accounts from surviving Indians are useful, but sometimes conflicting and unclear.\n\nWhile the gunfire heard on the bluffs by Reno and Benteen's men during the afternoon of June 25 was probably from Custer's fight, the soldiers on Reno Hill were unaware of what had happened to Custer until General Terry's arrival on June 27. They were reportedly stunned by the news. When the army examined the Custer battle site, soldiers could not determine fully what had transpired. Custer's force of roughly 210 men had been engaged by the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne about {{convert|3.5|mi|km}} to the north of Reno and Benteen's defensive position. Evidence of organized resistance included an apparent skirmish line on Calhoun Hill and apparent [[breastworks]] made of dead horses on Custer Hill.<ref name=\"michno1997\" /> By the time troops came to recover the bodies, the Lakota and Cheyenne had already removed most of their dead from the field. The troops found most of Custer's dead men stripped of their clothing, ritually mutilated, and in a state of decomposition, making identification of many impossible.<ref name=\"Brininstool, 60\u201362\">Brininstool, 60\u201362.</ref> The soldiers identified the 7th Cavalry's dead as best as possible and hastily buried them where they fell.\n\nCuster's body was found with two gunshot wounds; one to his left chest and the other to the left temple of his head. Either wound would have been fatal, though he appeared to have bled from only the chest wound, meaning his head wound may have been delivered postmortem. Some Lakota oral histories assert that Custer committed suicide to avoid capture and subsequent torture, though this is usually discounted since the wounds were inconsistent with his known right-handedness. (Other native accounts note several soldiers committing suicide near the end of the battle.)<ref>{{multiref|Wooden Leg, [[Thomas B.

The route taken by Custer to his \"Last Stand\" remains a subject of debate. One possibility is that after ordering Reno to charge, Custer continued down Reno Creek to within about a half-mile (800&nbsp;m) of the Little Bighorn, but then turned north and climbed up the bluffs, reaching the same spot to which Reno would soon retreat. From this point on the other side of the river, he could see Reno charging the village. Riding north along the bluffs, Custer could have descended into Medicine Tail Coulee. Some historians believe that part of Custer's force descended the coulee, going west to the river and attempting unsuccessfully to cross into the village. According to some accounts, a small contingent of Indian sharpshooters effectively opposed this crossing.\n\n[[File:Battle of the Little Big Horn.jpg|thumb|left|Lieutenant Colonel Custer and his U.S. Army troops are defeated in battle with Native American Lakota Sioux and Northern Cheyenne on the Little Bighorn Battlefield, June 25, 1876 at Little Bighorn River, Montana]]\n\nWhite Cow Bull claimed to have shot a leader wearing a buckskin jacket off his horse in the river. While no other Indian account supports this claim, if White Bull did shoot a buckskin-clad leader off his horse, some historians have argued that Custer may have been seriously wounded by him. Some Indian accounts claim that besides wounding one of the leaders of this advance, a soldier carrying a company [[Guidon (United States)|guidon]] was also hit.<ref>[http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/white_cow_bull_little_big_horn.html \"White Cow Bull's Story of the Battle of the Little Bighorn #1\"] {{webarchive |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080511210009/http://www.astonisher.com/archives/museum/white_cow_bull_little_big_horn.html |date=May 11, 2008 }}.</ref> Troopers had to dismount to help the wounded men back onto their horses.<ref name=\"michno1997\" />{{rp|117\u201319}} The fact that either of the non-mutilation wounds to Custer's body (a bullet wound below the heart and a shot to the left temple) would have been instantly fatal casts doubt on his being wounded and remounted.<ref>Wert, 1996, p. 355.</ref>\n\nReports of an attempted fording of the river at Medicine Tail Coulee might explain Custer's purpose for Reno's attack, that is, a coordinated \"hammer-and-anvil\" maneuver, with Reno's holding the Indians at bay at the southern end of the camp, while Custer drove them against Reno's line from the north. Other historians have noted that if Custer did attempt to cross the river near Medicine Tail Coulee, he may have believed it was the north end of the Indian camp, only to discover that it was only the middle. Some Indian accounts, however, place the Northern Cheyenne encampment and the north end of the overall village to the left (and south) of the opposite side of the crossing.<ref name=\"michno1997\" />{{rp|10\u201320}} The precise location of the north end of the village remains in dispute, however.\n\n[[File:Custer's route over Little Bighorn battlefield.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Custer's route over battlefield, as theorized by [[Edward S. Curtis|Curtis]]. (Credit: [[Northwestern University Library]] [http://digital.library.northwestern.edu/curtis/ ''Edward S. Curtis's The North American Indian,'' 2003]). ]]\n\n[[Edward S. Curtis|Edward Curtis]], the famed ethnologist and photographer of the Native American Indians, made a detailed personal study of the battle, interviewing many of those who had fought or taken part in it. First he went over the ground covered by the troops with the three Crow scouts [[White Man Runs Him]], [[Goes Ahead]], and [[Hairy Moccasin]], and then again with [[Two Moons]] and a party of Cheyenne warriors. He also visited the Lakota country and interviewed [[Red Hawk (chief)|Red Hawk]], \"whose recollection of the fight seemed to be particularly clear\".<ref name=\"curtis\" />{{rp|44}} Then, he went over the battlefield once more with the three Crow scouts, but also accompanied by General [[Charles Woodruff (general)|Charles Woodruff]] \"as I particularly desired that the testimony of these men might be considered by an experienced army officer\". Finally, Curtis visited the country of the [[Arikara people|Arikara]] and interviewed the scouts of that tribe who had been with Custer's command.<ref name=\"curtis\" />{{rp|44}} Based on all the information he gathered, Curtis concluded that Custer had indeed ridden down the Medicine Tail Coulee and then towards the river where he probably planned to ford it. However, \"the Indians had now discovered him and were gathered closely on the opposite side\".<ref name=\"curtis\" />{{rp|48}} They were soon joined by a large force of Sioux who (no longer engaging Reno) rushed down the valley. This was the beginning of their attack on Custer who was forced to turn and head for the hill where he would make his famous \"last stand\". Thus, wrote Curtis, \"Custer made no attack, the whole movement being a retreat\".<ref name=\"curtis\" />{{rp|49}}\n\n==== Other views of Custer's actions at Minneconjou Ford ====\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2013}}\nOther historians claim that Custer never approached the river, but rather continued north across the coulee and up the other side, where he gradually came under attack. According to this theory, by the time Custer realized he was badly outnumbered, it was too late to break back to the south where Reno and Benteen could have provided assistance. Two men from the 7th Cavalry, the young Crow scout ''Ashishishe'' (known in English as Curley) and the trooper [[Peter Thompson (soldier)|Peter Thompson]], claimed to have seen Custer engage the Indians. The accuracy of their recollections remains controversial; accounts by battle participants and assessments by historians almost universally discredit Thompson's claim.\n\n[[File:Custer's last stand painting.jpg|thumb|\"Custer's Last Stand.\" Lieutenant Colonel Custer standing center, wearing buckskin, with few of his soldiers of the 7th Cavalry still standing.]]\n\nArchaeological evidence and reassessment of Indian testimony has led to a new interpretation of the battle. In the 1920s, battlefield investigators discovered hundreds of .45\u201355 shell cases along the ridge line known today as Nye-Cartwright Ridge, between South Medicine Tail Coulee and the next drainage at North Medicine Tail (also known as Deep Coulee). Some historians believe Custer divided his detachment into two (and possibly three) battalions, retaining personal command of one while presumably delegating Captain George W. Yates to command the second.\n\nEvidence from the 1920s supports the theory that at least one of the companies made a feint attack southeast from Nye-Cartwright Ridge straight down the center of the \"V\" formed by the intersection at the crossing of Medicine Tail Coulee on the right and Calhoun Coulee on the left. The intent may have been to relieve pressure on Reno's detachment (according to the Crow scout Curley, possibly viewed by both Mitch Bouyer and Custer) by withdrawing the skirmish line into the timber on the edge of the Little Bighorn River. Had the U.S. troops come straight down Medicine Tail Coulee, their approach to the Minneconjou Crossing and the northern area of the village would have been masked by the high ridges running on the northwest side of the Little Bighorn River.\n\nThat they might have come southeast, from the center of Nye-Cartwright Ridge, seems to be supported by Northern Cheyenne accounts of seeing the approach of the distinctly white-colored horses of Company E, known as the Grey Horse Company. Its approach was seen by Indians at that end of the village. Behind them, a second company, further up on the heights, would have provided long-range cover fire. Warriors could have been drawn to the feint attack, forcing the battalion back towards the heights, up the north fork drainage, away from the troops providing cover fire above. The covering company would have moved towards a reunion, delivering heavy [[volley fire]] and leaving the trail of expended cartridges discovered 50 years later.\n\n=== Last stand ===\n[[File:Edgar Samuel Paxson - Custer's Last Stand.jpg|thumb|''Custer's Last Stand'' by [[Edgar Samuel Paxson]]]]\nIn the end, the hilltop to which Custer had moved was probably too small to accommodate all of the survivors and wounded. Fire from the southeast made it impossible for Custer's men to secure a defensive position all around Last Stand Hill where the soldiers put up their most dogged defense. According to Lakota accounts, far more of their casualties occurred in the attack on Last Stand Hill than anywhere else. The extent of the soldiers' resistance indicated they had few doubts about their prospects for survival. According to Cheyenne and Sioux testimony, the command structure rapidly broke down, although smaller \"last stands\" were apparently made by several groups. Custer's remaining companies (E, F, and half of C) were soon killed.\n\nBy almost all accounts, the Lakota annihilated Custer's force within an hour of engagement.<ref>Miller, David Humphreys, ''Custer's Fall'', Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 1985, pg 158</ref><ref>Graham, Benteen letter to Capt.

Many of these men threw down their weapons while Cheyenne and Sioux warriors rode them down, \"[[counting coup]]\" with lances, coup sticks, and [[quirt]]s. Some Native accounts recalled this segment of the fight as a \"buffalo run.\"<ref>Graham, pp. 45\u201356.</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Frederick William Benteen|Frederick Benteen]], battalion leader of Companies D, H and K, recalled his observations on the Custer battlefield on June 27, 1876\n\n{{quote|I went over the battlefield carefully with a view to determine how the battle was fought.

This left about 50-60 men, mostly from F Company and the staff, on Last Stand Hill. The remainder of the battle took on the nature of a running fight. Modern archaeology and historical Indian accounts indicate that Custer's force may have been divided into three groups, with the Indians attempting to prevent them from effectively reuniting. Indian accounts describe warriors (including women) running up from the village to wave blankets in order to scare off the soldiers' horses. One 7th Cavalry trooper claimed finding a number of stone ''mallets'' consisting of a round cobble weighing 8\u201310 pounds (about 4&nbsp;kg) with a rawhide handle, which he believed had been used by the Indian women to finish off the wounded.<ref name=Scott-TheyDied>{{cite book |title=They Died With Custer: Soldiers' Bones from the Battle of the Little Bighorn |first1=Douglas D. |last1=Scott |first2=P. |last2=Willey |first3=Melissa A. |last3=Connor |location=Norman |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |year=2013 |orig-year=1998 |url={{GBurl|id=KO-9A4b2t4IC}} |isbn=978-0-8061-3507-7 |ignore-isbn-error=yes}}</ref>{{rp|314}} Fighting dismounted, the soldiers' skirmish lines were overwhelmed. Army doctrine would have called for one man in four to be a horseholder behind the skirmish lines and, in extreme cases, one man in eight. Later, the troops would have bunched together in defensive positions and are alleged to have shot their remaining horses as cover. As individual troopers were wounded or killed, initial defensive positions would have been abandoned as untenable.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Gray, John C. \"Custer's Last Campaign\"</ref>\n\nUnder threat of attack, the first U.S. soldiers on the battlefield three days later hurriedly buried the troopers in shallow graves, more or less where they had fallen. A couple of years after the battle, markers were placed where men were believed to have fallen, so the placement of troops has been roughly construed. The troops evidently died in several groups, including on Custer Hill, around Captain [[Myles Keogh]], and strung out towards the Little Bighorn River.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n==== Last break-out attempt ====\n[[File:2008 0909Battlefield0026.JPG|thumb|[[Mitch Bouyer]] marker on Deep Ravine trail.

Instead, archaeologists suggest that in the end, Custer's troops were not surrounded but rather overwhelmed by a single charge. This scenario corresponds to several Indian accounts stating Crazy Horse's charge swarmed the resistance, with the surviving soldiers fleeing in panic.<ref name=\"michno1997\" /><ref group=\"note\">Testimony of Yellow Nose.</ref> Many of these troopers may have ended up in a deep ravine 300\u2013400 yards away from what is known today as Custer Hill.

For example, near the town of Garryowen, portions of the skeleton of a trooper killed in the Reno Retreat were recovered from an eroding bank of the Little Big Horn, while the rest of the remains had apparently been washed away by the river.<ref name=Scott-TheyDied/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width =350\n| image1    = 18760706 Indian War - The Helena Independent.png\n| alt1      = \n| width1    = \n| caption1  = This Helena, Montana newspaper article did not report the June 25 battle until July 6, referring to a July 3 story from a Bozeman, Montana newspaper\u2014itself eight days after the event.<ref name=HelenaIndependent_18760706>{{cite news |title=Indian War / Gen.

Of those sixty figures only thirty some are portrayed with a conventional Plains Indian method of indicating death.

Otis of the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry]] was promoted to replace Custer effective June 25, 1876, but did not report until February 1877. Two 1876 West Point graduates designated for the 7th Cavalry were advanced to 1st lieutenant effective 10 days after their graduation. Four others appointed to other regiments, along with eight experienced 2nd lieutenants, were transferred and designated one to each company of the 7th. However, five declined the appointment, replaced by 2nd lieutenants of infantry and unappointed new officers in July and August 1876. Only three replacements were able to report while the 7th was still in the field.</ref> and recruiting efforts began to fill the depleted ranks. The regiment, reorganized into eight companies, remained in the field as part of the Terry Expedition, now based on the Yellowstone River at the mouth of the Bighorn and reinforced by Gibbon's column. On August 8, 1876, after Terry was further reinforced with the 5th Infantry, the expedition moved up Rosebud Creek in pursuit of the Lakota. It met with Crook's command, similarly reinforced, and the combined force, almost 4,000 strong, followed the Lakota trail northeast toward the [[Little Missouri River (North Dakota)|Little Missouri River]]. Persistent rain and lack of supplies forced the column to dissolve and return to its varying starting points. The 7th Cavalry returned to Fort Abraham Lincoln to reconstitute. The regimental commander, Colonel [[Samuel D. Sturgis]], returned from his detached duty in St. Louis, Missouri. Sturgis led the 7th Cavalry in the campaign against the [[Nez Perce War|Nez Perce]] in 1877.\n\n=== Expansion of the U.S. Army ===\nThe U.S. Congress authorized appropriations to expand the Army by 2,500 men to meet the emergency after the defeat of the 7th Cavalry. For a session, the Democratic Party-controlled House of Representatives abandoned its campaign to reduce the size of the Army. Word of Custer's fate reached the 44th United States Congress as a conference committee was attempting to reconcile opposing appropriations bills approved by the House and the Republican Senate. They approved a measure to increase the size of cavalry companies to 100 enlisted men on July 24. The committee temporarily lifted the ceiling on the size of the Army by 2,500 on August 15.<ref>Utley, Robert M.

The court found Reno's conduct to be without fault. After the battle, Thomas Rosser, James O'Kelly, and others continued to question the conduct of Reno due to his hastily ordered retreat.<ref>Donovan, James (2008). ''A Terrible Glory: Custer and the Little Bighorn \u2013 the Last Great Battle of the American West'' (Kindle Location 5870). Little, Brown and Company. Kindle Edition.</ref> Defenders of Reno at the trial noted that, while the retreat was disorganized, Reno did not withdraw from his position until it became apparent that he was outnumbered and outflanked by the Indians. Contemporary accounts also point to the fact that Reno's scout, Bloody Knife, was shot in the head, spraying him with blood, possibly increasing his own panic and distress.<ref name=\"Fox1993\" />\n\n=== Custer's errors ===\nGeneral Terry and others claimed that Custer made strategic errors from the start of the campaign. For instance, he refused to use a battery of Gatling guns, and turned down General Terry's offer of an additional battalion of the 2nd Cavalry. Custer believed that the Gatling guns would impede his march up the Rosebud and hamper his mobility. His rapid march en route to the Little Bighorn averaged nearly {{convert|30|mi|km}} a day, so his assessment appears to have been accurate. Custer planned \"to live and travel like Indians; in this manner the command will be able to go wherever the Indians can\", he wrote in his ''Herald'' dispatch.<ref name=\"Donovan 2008\">Donovan (2008).

Each of the heavy, hand-cranked weapons could fire up to 350 rounds a minute, an impressive rate, but they were known to jam frequently. During the [[Black Hills Expedition]] two years earlier, a Gatling gun had turned over, rolled down a mountain, and shattered to pieces. Lieutenant William Low, commander of the artillery detachment, was said to have almost wept when he learned he had been excluded from the strike force.<ref name=\"Donovan 2008\" />\n\nCuster believed that the 7th Cavalry could handle any Indian force and that the addition of the four companies of the 2nd would not alter the outcome. When offered the 2nd Cavalry, he reportedly replied that the 7th \"could handle anything.\"<ref>Connell, Evan S. (1997). ''Son of the Morning Star''. New York: HarperPerennial, p. 257.</ref> There is evidence that Custer suspected that he would be outnumbered by the Indians, although he did not know by how much. By dividing his forces, Custer could have caused the defeat of the entire column, had it not been for Benteen's and Reno's linking up to make a desperate yet successful stand on the bluff above the southern end of the camp.<ref>Donovan (2008). ''A Terrible Glory''(Kindle Location 5758)</ref>\n\nThe historian James Donovan believed that Custer's dividing his force into four smaller detachments (including the pack train) can be attributed to his inadequate reconnaissance; he also ignored the warnings of his Crow scouts and Charley Reynolds.<ref>Donovan (2008).

At the same time, a House committee was busy debating a new appropriations bill that required a major reorganization of the army. \"Reduction of expenses\" was emphasized. One proposal would lop off entire regiments, including two cavalry regiments. Another would set the line officers (those in the field) from Major down back a few years in the promotion schedule. The total reduction in officers was proposed to be 406, almost 25 percent of the total.

Gallear's analysis minimizes the allegation that rapid depletion of ammunition in lever-action models influenced the decision in favor of the single-shot Springfield. The [[American Indian Wars|Indian War]], in this context, appears as a minor theatre of conflict, whose contingencies were unlikely to govern the selection of standard weaponry for an emerging industrialized nation.<ref>Gallear, 2001: \"The established wisdom is that the U.S. Army did not adopt lever-action multiple shot weapons during the Civil War because of the problems they would create regarding the supply of ammunition. However, I believe that by the time of the Indian Wars the Army viewed the lever-actions weapons as under-powered novelty weapons and that they were equipping their men to fight wars against European equipped enemies or to re-fight the Civil War. The Indian Wars were seen as a minor sideshow in which troops armed to fight on European battlefields would be more than a match for fighting any number of Indians.</ref>\n\nThe Springfield carbine is praised for its \"superior range and stopping power\" by historian James Donovan, and author Charles M. Robinson reports that the rifle could be \"loaded and fired much more rapidly than its muzzle loading predecessors, and had twice the range of repeating rifles such as the Winchester, Henry and Spencer.\"<ref>Donovan, 2008, p. 191: \"...a solid weapon with superior range and stopping power...\"</ref><ref>Robinson, 1995, p. xxviii</ref><ref>Gallear, 2001: \"The Army saw breech-loading rifles and carbines as the way forward. They could fire a much more powerful round at longer ranges than lever-actions.\"</ref>\n\nGallear points out that lever-action rifles, after a burst of rapid discharge, still required a reloading interlude that lowered their overall rate of fire; Springfield breechloaders \"in the long run, had a higher rate of fire, which was sustainable throughout a battle.\"<ref>Gallear, 2001</ref>\n\nThe breechloader design patent for the Springfield's Erskine S. Allin [[Single-shot#Trapdoor actions|trapdoor system]] was owned by the US government and the firearm could be easily adapted for production with existing machinery at the [[Springfield Armory]] in Massachusetts.<ref>Gallear, 2001: \"The Allin System had been developed at the Government Armories to reduce the cost, but the U.S. Treasury had already been forced to pay $124,000 to inventors whose patents it infringed. The adoption of the Allin breech gave the advantages of being already familiar throughout the Army, involved no more royalties, and existing machinery at the Springfield Armory could easily be adapted to its manufacture.</ref> At time when funding for the post-war Army had been slashed, the prospect for economical production influenced the Ordnance Board member selection of the Springfield option.<ref>Donovan, 2008, p. 191: \"Army appropriations were at an all-time low, and a key factor in the Springfield's favor was its low production cost.\"</ref>\n\n==== Malfunction of the Springfield carbine extractor mechanism ====\nThe question as to whether the reported malfunction of the Model 1873 Springfield carbine issued to the 7th Cavalry contributed to their defeat has been debated for years.<ref>Gallear, 2001: \"...some authorities have blamed the gun's reliability and tendency for rounds to jam in the breech for the defeat at the Little Bighorn..\"</ref>\n\nThat the weapon experienced jamming of the extractor is not contested, but its contribution to Custer's defeat is considered negligible. This conclusion is supported by evidence from archaeological studies performed at the battlefield, where the recovery of Springfield cartridge casing, bearing tell-tale scratch marks indicating manual extraction, were rare.\nThe flaw in the ejector mechanism was known to the Army Ordnance Board at the time of the selection of the Model 1873 rifle and carbine, and was not considered a significant shortcoming in the overall worthiness of the shoulder arm.<ref>Hatch, 1997, p. 124: \"This defect was noted by the board of officers (which included Major Reno) that selected the weapon in 1872, but was not considered particularly serious at the time.\"</ref> With the ejector failure in US Army tests as low as 1:300, the Springfield carbine was vastly more reliable than the muzzle-loading Springfields used in the Civil War.<ref>Gallear, 2001: \"A study of .45-55 cases found at the battle concludes that extractor failure amounted to less than 0.35% of some 1,751 cases tested...the carbine was in fact more reliable than anything that had preceded it in U.S. Army service. These weapons were vastly more reliable than the muzzle-loading weapons of the Civil War, which would frequently misfire and cause the soldier to uselessly load multiple rounds on top of each other in the heat of battle.</ref><ref>Hatch, 1997, p. 124: 'Scholars have for years debated the issue of whether or not the Model 1873 Springfield carbine carried by cavalrymen, malfunctioned during the battle and [whether this] was one reason for the defeat\" and \"No definitive conclusion can be drawn [as to] the possible malfunction...as being a significant cause of Custer's defeat. Writers of both pro- and anti-Custer material over the years...have incorporated the theory into their works...\"</ref>\n\nGallear addresses the post-battle testimony concerning the copper .45-55 cartridges supplied to the troops in which an officer is said to have cleared the chambers of spent cartridges for a number of Springfield carbines.<ref>Donovan, 2008, p. 440: footnote, \"the carbine extractor problem did exist, though it probably had little impact on the outcome of the battle. DeRudio testified that 'the men had to take their knives to extract cartridges after firing 6 to 10 rounds.'...but 'the men' seems to have been an exaggeration. Private Daniel Newall mentioned the problem...\"</ref> This testimony of widespread fusing of the casings offered to the Chief of Ordnance at the Reno Court of Inquiry in 1879 conflicts with the archaeological evidence collected at the battlefield. Field data showed that possible extractor failures occurred at a rate of approximately 1:30 firings at the Custer Battlefield and at a rate of 1:37 at the Reno-Benteen Battlefield.<ref>Hatch, 1997, p. 124: \"The controversy results from the known failure of the carbine to [eject] the spent .45-55 caliber cartridge [casings]. The cartridge cases were made of copper, which expands when hot. That \u2013 coupled with a faulty extractor mechanism and dirt \u2013 could cause the head of the cartridge to be torn away when the block was opened, and the cartridge cylinder would then be left inside the chamber...The casings would have to be removed manually with a pocketknife before [reloading and] firing again. This defect was noted by the board of officers (which included Major Reno) that selected the weapon in 1872, but was not considered particularly serious at the time.\"</ref><ref>Hatch, 1997, p. 124: \"How often did this defect [ejector failure] occur and cause the [Springfield carbines] to malfunction on June 25, 1876? According to Dr. Richard Fox in ''Archeology, History and Custer's Last Battle'' (1993), there were very few .45-55 caliber cartridge casings found during the digs on the battlefield that showed any evidence to pry or scratch marks [indicating manual extraction]. Only 3 of 88 [3.4%] found on the Custer [battalion] portion of the battlefield could possibly have been removed in an extraction jam. On the Reno-Benteen defense site [Reno Hill], 7 of 257 fit this category [2.7%]. If this was a representative number it would appear that malfunction from that source was minimal.\"</ref><ref>Hatch, 1997, p. 124: \"Both sides [troopers and Indians] apparently believed that some weapons malfunctioned. Indian testimony...reported that some soldiers threw down their long guns and fought with their short guns. Could this indicate a malfunctioning [carbine] that was discarded and therefore could not have left its marked [pry scratched] casings on the field? ... No definitive conclusion can be drawn about the possible malfunction...as being a significant cause of Custer's defeat. Writers of both pro- and anti-Custer material over the years...have incorporated the theory into their works...\"</ref>\n\nHistorian Thom Hatch observes that the Model 1873 Springfield, despite the known ejector flaw, remained the standard issue shoulder arm for US troops until the early 1890s.<ref>Hatch, 1997, p. 124: \"On a final note: the Springfield carbine remained the official cavalry firearm until the early 1890s\"</ref> when the copper-cased, inside-primed cartridges were replaced with brass.\n\n== Survivor claims ==\n[[File:Giovanni Martini (militare).jpg|thumb|John Martin wearing the US Army uniform, ca. 1904]]\n\nSoldiers under Custer's direct command were annihilated on the first day of the battle (except for three [[Crow scouts]] and several troopers (including [[Giovanni Martino|John Martin (Giovanni Martino)]]) that had left that column before the battle; one Crow scout, [[Curly (scout)|Curly]], was the only survivor to leave after the battle had begun), although for years rumors persisted of other survivors.<ref group=\"note\">Graham, 146.

[[Theodore Goldin]], a battle participant who later became a controversial historian on the event, wrote (in regards to Charles Hayward's claim to have been with Custer and taken prisoner):\n\n<blockquote> The Indians always insisted that they took no prisoners. If they did\u2014a thing I firmly believe\u2014they were tortured and killed the night of the 25th. As an evidence of this I recall the three charred and burned heads we picked up in the village near the scene of the big war dance, when we visited the village with Capt. Benteen and Lieut. Wallace on the morning of the 27th... I'm sorely afraid, Tony, that we will have to class Hayward's story, like that of so many others, as pure, unadulterated B. S. As a clerk at headquarters I had occasion to look over the morning reports of at least the six troops at Lincoln almost daily, and never saw his name there, or among the list of scouts employed from time to time ... I am hoping that some day all of these damned fakirs will die and it will be safe for actual participants in the battle to admit and insist that they were there, without being branded and looked upon as a lot of damned liars. Actually, there have been times when I have been tempted to deny that I ever heard of the 7th Cavalry, much less participated with it in that engagement ... My Medal of Honor and its inscription have served me as proof positive that I was at least in the vicinity at the time in question, otherwise I should be tempted to deny all knowledge of the event.<ref name=\"A Pretended Custer Survivor\">{{cite web| title=A Pretended Custer Survivor: Another Attempt to Pose As a Survivor Punctured by the Regiment's Clerk| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=mdGv78FIKkEC&dat=19260505&printsec=frontpage&hl=en| publisher=The Big Horn Searchlight| accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe only documented and verified survivor of Custer's command (having been actually involved in Custer's part of the battle) was Captain Keogh's horse, [[Comanche (horse)|Comanche]].

In 1946, it was re-designated as the ''Custer Battlefield [[U.S. National Monument|National Monument]]'', reflecting its association with Custer. In 1967, Major Marcus Reno was re-interred in the cemetery with honors, including an eleven-gun salute. Beginning in the early 1970s, there was concern within the [[National Park Service]] over the name Custer Battlefield National Monument failing to adequately reflect the larger history of the battle between two cultures. Hearings on the name change were held in [[Billings, Montana|Billings]] on June 10, 1991, and during the following months Congress renamed the site the ''Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument''.\n\nUnited States memorialization of the battlefield began in 1879 with a temporary monument to the U.S. dead. In 1881, the current marble obelisk was erected in their honor. In 1890, marble blocks were added to mark the places where the U.S. cavalry soldiers fell.\n\nNearly 100 years later, ideas about the meaning of the battle have become more inclusive. The United States government acknowledged that Native American sacrifices also deserved recognition at the site. The 1991 bill changing the name of the national monument also authorized an Indian Memorial to be built near Last Stand Hill in honor of Lakota and Cheyenne warriors. The commissioned work by native artist [[Colleen Cutschall]] is shown in the photograph at right. On Memorial Day 1999, in consultation with tribal representatives, the U.S. added two red granite markers to the battlefield to note where Native American warriors fell. As of December 2006, a total of ten warrior markers have been added (three at the Reno\u2013Benteen Defense Site and seven on the Little Bighorn Battlefield).<ref>National Park Service website for the Little Bighorn Battlefield.</ref>\n\nThe Indian Memorial, themed \"Peace Through Unity\" l is an open circular structure that stands {{convert|75|yd|abbr=off}} from the 7th Cavalry obelisk.
