It is one of the top singles championships for women among WWE's three main brands, along with the [[WWE Raw Women's Championship]] on [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship]] on [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]. The current champion is [[Rhea Ripley]], who is in her first reign.\n\nIntroduced on April 5, 2013, the title was established as the women's championship for NXT, which at the time was a [[Farm team|developmental territory]] for WWE. The inaugural champion was [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]]. Over the years, NXT grew to become WWE's third major brand, which became official in September 2019 when NXT was moved to the [[USA Network]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Paige as NXT Women's Champion WrestleMania Axxess 2014 3.jpg|thumb|upright|The inaugural NXT Women's Champion [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]], shown here with the original championship belt design]]\nIn June 2012, the [[WWE]] established [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] as their [[Farm team|developmental territory]], replacing [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] (FCW). The following year on April 5, the NXT Women's Championship was introduced during [[WrestleMania Axxess]]. On the May 30 tapings of ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'' ([[Broadcast delay|aired]] June 5), WWE's [[Chief Brand Officer]] [[Stephanie McMahon]] announced that there would be an eight-woman [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] [[Professional wrestling tournament|tournament]], featuring four women from NXT and four from WWE's main roster competing to be crowned the first NXT Women's Champion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=WWE NEWS: McMahon's Friday tweet - anti-smoking, Stephanie introduces NXT Women's Title (w/Pic), Cena check-in, Ross new blog, Dupree wins title|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_70982.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Namako|first=Jason|title=WWE NXT Results - 5/30/13 (#1 Contender Battle Royal)|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/41777-wwe-nxt-results-5-30-13-1-contender-battle-royal|work=Wrestleview|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Justin|title=James's WWE NXT results 5/29 & 6/5: Wyatts defend Tag Titles, NXT Women's Title introduced, #1 contender battle royal, Parade of released NXT wrestlers in matches|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_71102.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> During the June 20 tapings of ''NXT'' (aired July 24), [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]] defeated [[Emma (wrestler)|Emma]] in the tournament final to become the inaugural champion.<ref name=FirstChamp/>\n\nPaige successfully defended her title at [[NXT Arrival|Arrival]] against Emma, however, then-NXT [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Manager (GM) 4|General Manager]] [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] stripped Paige of the title on the April 24, 2014 episode of ''NXT'', as Paige had recently won the [[WWE Divas Championship]], and was in turn promoted to WWE's main roster. A new tournament began the following week. The finals occurred at [[NXT TakeOver|TakeOver]] where [[Charlotte Flair|Charlotte]] defeated [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]] to win the vacant NXT Women's Championship. On the September 16, 2015 episode of ''NXT'', now NXT General Manager [[William Regal]] announced that [[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] would defend her title against [[Sasha Banks]] in the [[main event]] at [[NXT TakeOver: Respect|TakeOver: Respect]] on October 7 in the first ever 30-minute [[Iron Man match|Iron Woman match]] in WWE history.<ref name=\"NXTSeptember16\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_87531.shtml|title=James's WWE NXT report 9/16 - Week 180: Bayley returns to Full Sail as Women's champ, big set-up for \"Takeover,\" Dusty Tag Classic continues, Adam Rose dumps on NXT, more; Overall Reax|author=James, Justin|website=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}</ref> At the event, Bayley defeated Banks to retain the championship, scoring the win with 3 falls to 2.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Melok|first1=Bobby|title=NXT Women's Champion Bayley vs. Sasha Banks (30-Minute WWE Iron Man Match)|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/nxt-takeover-2015-10-07/bayley-sasha-banks-nxt-womens-title-iron-man-match-27942052|publisher=WWE|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=97087&p=3|title=WWE NXT TakeOver Respect report: Sasha Banks and Bayley go 30 minutes, the first Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic winners crowned, Asuka makes her NXT in ring debut (poor Dana), and more|author=Trionfo, Richard|website=PWInsider|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough NXT had been established as WWE's developmental territory, over the years it grew to establish itself as WWE's third major brand.

At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

It is one of the top singles championships for women among WWE's three main brands, along with the [[WWE Raw Women's Championship]] on [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship]] on [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]. The current champion is [[Rhea Ripley]], who is in her first reign.\n\nIntroduced on April 5, 2013, the title was established as the women's championship for NXT, which at the time was a [[Farm team|developmental territory]] for WWE. The inaugural champion was [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]]. Over the years, NXT grew to become WWE's third major brand, which became official in September 2019 when NXT was moved to the [[USA Network]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Paige as NXT Women's Champion WrestleMania Axxess 2014 3.jpg|thumb|upright|The inaugural NXT Women's Champion [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]], shown here with the original championship belt design]]\nIn June 2012, the [[WWE]] established [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] as their [[Farm team|developmental territory]], replacing [[Florida Championship Wrestling]] (FCW). The following year on April 5, the NXT Women's Championship was introduced during [[WrestleMania Axxess]]. On the May 30 tapings of ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'' ([[Broadcast delay|aired]] June 5), WWE's [[Chief Brand Officer]] [[Stephanie McMahon]] announced that there would be an eight-woman [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] [[Professional wrestling tournament|tournament]], featuring four women from NXT and four from WWE's main roster competing to be crowned the first NXT Women's Champion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=WWE NEWS: McMahon's Friday tweet - anti-smoking, Stephanie introduces NXT Women's Title (w/Pic), Cena check-in, Ross new blog, Dupree wins title|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_70982.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Namako|first=Jason|title=WWE NXT Results - 5/30/13 (#1 Contender Battle Royal)|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/41777-wwe-nxt-results-5-30-13-1-contender-battle-royal|work=Wrestleview|accessdate=May 31, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Justin|title=James's WWE NXT results 5/29 & 6/5: Wyatts defend Tag Titles, NXT Women's Title introduced, #1 contender battle royal, Parade of released NXT wrestlers in matches|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_71102.shtml|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> During the June 20 tapings of ''NXT'' (aired July 24), [[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]] defeated [[Emma (wrestler)|Emma]] in the tournament final to become the inaugural champion.<ref name=FirstChamp/>\n\nPaige successfully defended her title at [[NXT Arrival|Arrival]] against Emma, however, then-NXT [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Manager (GM) 4|General Manager]] [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] stripped Paige of the title on the April 24, 2014 episode of ''NXT'', as Paige had recently won the [[WWE Divas Championship]], and was in turn promoted to WWE's main roster. A new tournament began the following week. The finals occurred at [[NXT TakeOver|TakeOver]] where [[Charlotte Flair|Charlotte]] defeated [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]] to win the vacant NXT Women's Championship. On the September 16, 2015 episode of ''NXT'', now NXT General Manager [[William Regal]] announced that [[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] would defend her title against [[Sasha Banks]] in the [[main event]] at [[NXT TakeOver: Respect|TakeOver: Respect]] on October 7 in the first ever 30-minute [[Iron Man match|Iron Woman match]] in WWE history.<ref name=\"NXTSeptember16\">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/wwenxtreport/article_87531.shtml|title=James's WWE NXT report 9/16 - Week 180: Bayley returns to Full Sail as Women's champ, big set-up for \"Takeover,\" Dusty Tag Classic continues, Adam Rose dumps on NXT, more; Overall Reax|author=James, Justin|website=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}</ref> At the event, Bayley defeated Banks to retain the championship, scoring the win with 3 falls to 2.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Melok|first1=Bobby|title=NXT Women's Champion Bayley vs. Sasha Banks (30-Minute WWE Iron Man Match)|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wwenxt/nxt-takeover-2015-10-07/bayley-sasha-banks-nxt-womens-title-iron-man-match-27942052|publisher=WWE|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=97087&p=3|title=WWE NXT TakeOver Respect report: Sasha Banks and Bayley go 30 minutes, the first Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic winners crowned, Asuka makes her NXT in ring debut (poor Dana), and more|author=Trionfo, Richard|website=PWInsider|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough NXT had been established as WWE's developmental territory, over the years it grew to establish itself as WWE's third major brand.

At the top of the plate was the WWE logo. The center of the plate was the NXT logo encrusted with pink diamonds; red coloring was behind the letter \"X\". Above the NXT logo read \"Women's\" while below the logo read \"Champion\". There were two side plates, which were skinny and matched the curve of the center plate. The inner side plates were encrusted with pink diamonds, while the outer side plates were blank silver plates. The plates were on a black leather strap. When first introduced, the WWE logo was the long-standing scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre-existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. \n\nOn April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the existing NXT title belts at the time would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at [[NXT TakeOver: Orlando|TakeOver: Orlando]] that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. The redesigned women's championship features a nearly identical design to the [[NXT Championship#Belt design|redesigned NXT Championship]], including being on a black leather strap, but with a couple of notable differences. The belt is smaller to fit the women. The letters \"N X T\" on the center plate are silver instead of gold, while the rest of the plate is gold. One other difference is that a banner reading \"Women's\" is underneath the WWE logo. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the new design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default plates feature the WWE logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wwe/videos/10154635435021443/|title=EXCLUSIVE: WWE NXT General William Regal arrives at WrestleMania Axxess with a HUGE announcement regarding NXT TakeOver: Orlando!|date=April 1, 2017|author=[[WWE]]|work=[[Facebook]]|accessdate=April 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Reigns ==\n<!-- Do NOT DELETE THE TEMPLATE ON THE REIGNING CHAMPIONS REIGN IT INDICATES THE CURRENT CHAMPIONS.

Although a few of these were cancelled, the type was and remains the most numerous class of capital ship ever built to a single design.<ref>see Winfield & Roberts, op.cit.</ref>\n\nThe class was designed by [[Jacques-No\u00ebl San\u00e9]] in 1782 as a development of the [[French ship Annibal (1779)|''Annibal'']] and her near-sister [[French ship Northumberland (1780)|''Northumberland'']], both of which had been designed by him and built at Brest during the 1777-1780 period. Some thirteen ships were ordered and built to this new design from 1782 to 1785, and then the same design was adopted as a standard for all subsequent 74-gun ships (the most common type of ship of the line throughout the period from ''ca.''1750 to 1830) built for the French Navy during the next three decades as part of the fleet expansion programme instituted by [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] in 1786.<ref>{{Cite book|title=British Warships in the Age of Sail, 1793-1817: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates|last=Winfield|first=Rif|publisher=Seaforth Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1844157174|location=|pages=|page=69}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=French Warships in the Age of Sail, 1786-1861: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates|last=Winfield|first=Rif|publisher=Seaforth Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-184832-2042|location=|pages=|page=87}}</ref>\n\nThe design was appreciated in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], which eagerly commissioned captured ships and even copied the design with the {{Sclass-|Pomp\u00e9e|ship of the line|5}} and {{Sclass-|America|ship of the line|4}}.\n\n==Variants from basic design==\nWhile all the French 74-gun ships from the mid-1780s until the close of the Napoleonic Wars were to the ''T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'' design, there were three variants of the basic design which San\u00e9 developed with the same hull form of ''T\u00e9m\u00e9raire''. In 1793 two ships were laid down at Brest to an enlarged design; in 1801 two ships were commenced at Lorient with a slightly shorter length than the standard design (with a third ship commenced at Brest but never completed); and in 1803 two ships were commenced at Toulon to a smaller version (many more ships to this 'small(er) model' were then built in the shipyards controlled by France in Italy and the Netherlands) - these are detailed separately below.\n\n== Ships in class ==\n{{list to table|date=January 2017}}\n=== ''T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'' group (18 ships) ===\n* {{Ship|French ship|T\u00e9m\u00e9raire|1782|2}}\n:Builder: [[Brest, France|Brest]] shipyard\n:Ordered: 15 February 1782\n:Laid down: May 1782\n:Launched: 17 December 1782\n:Completed: July 1783\n:Fate: Condemned, November 1801.

Although a few of these were cancelled, the type was and remains the most numerous class of capital ship ever built to a single design.<ref>see Winfield & Roberts, op.cit.</ref>\n\nThe class was designed by [[Jacques-No\u00ebl San\u00e9]] in 1782 as a development of the [[French ship Annibal (1779)|''Annibal'']] and her near-sister [[French ship Northumberland (1780)|''Northumberland'']], both of which had been designed by him and built at Brest during the 1777-1780 period. Some thirteen ships were ordered and built to this new design from 1782 to 1785, and then the same design was adopted as a standard for all subsequent 74-gun ships (the most common type of ship of the line throughout the period from ''ca.''1750 to 1830) built for the French Navy during the next three decades as part of the fleet expansion programme instituted by [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] in 1786.<ref>{{Cite book|title=British Warships in the Age of Sail, 1793-1817: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates|last=Winfield|first=Rif|publisher=Seaforth Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1844157174|location=|pages=|page=69}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=French Warships in the Age of Sail, 1786-1861: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates|last=Winfield|first=Rif|publisher=Seaforth Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-184832-2042|location=|pages=|page=87}}</ref>\n\nThe design was appreciated in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], which eagerly commissioned captured ships and even copied the design with the {{Sclass-|Pomp\u00e9e|ship of the line|5}} and {{Sclass-|America|ship of the line|4}}.\n\n==Variants from basic design==\nWhile all the French 74-gun ships from the mid-1780s until the close of the Napoleonic Wars were to the ''T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'' design, there were three variants of the basic design which San\u00e9 developed with the same hull form of ''T\u00e9m\u00e9raire''. In 1793 two ships were laid down at Brest to an enlarged design; in 1801 two ships were commenced at Lorient with a slightly shorter length than the standard design (with a third ship commenced at Brest but never completed); and in 1803 two ships were commenced at Toulon to a smaller version (many more ships to this 'small(er) model' were then built in the shipyards controlled by France in Italy and the Netherlands) - these are detailed separately below.\n\n== Ships in class ==\n{{list to table|date=January 2017}}\n=== ''T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'' group (18 ships) ===\n* {{Ship|French ship|T\u00e9m\u00e9raire|1782|2}}\n:Builder: [[Brest, France|Brest]] shipyard\n:Ordered: 15 February 1782\n:Laid down: May 1782\n:Launched: 17 December 1782\n:Completed: July 1783\n:Fate: Condemned, November 1801.

The establishment of the MPA in 2000 marked a fundamental change in the policing of London; establishing, for the first time, a local police authority for the metropolis, with the aim of ensuring that the Metropolitan Police Service was democratically accountable.\n\nThe MPA had a strategic role and was not responsible for the day-to-day delivery of policing \u2013 which continued to be the direct responsibility of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police (then London's Chief of Police). The MPA worked closely with the MPS and its partners, including London's 32 borough councils, crime and disorder reduction partnerships and other agencies in the criminal justice system. In addition to its general strategic functions, the MPA set and monitored the annual police budget.\n\nIt consisted of 23 members: 12 [[London Assembly]] members, appointed by the [[Mayor of London]] in accordance with the political balance on the Assembly, four [[magistrate]]s, and seven independents.  The MPA was set up in 2000 as a functional body of the [[Greater London Authority]], by the [[Greater London Authority Act 1999]].

The establishment of the MPA in 2000 marked a fundamental change in the policing of London; establishing, for the first time, a local police authority for the metropolis, with the aim of ensuring that the Metropolitan Police Service was democratically accountable.\n\nThe MPA had a strategic role and was not responsible for the day-to-day delivery of policing \u2013 which continued to be the direct responsibility of the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police (then London's Chief of Police). The MPA worked closely with the MPS and its partners, including London's 32 borough councils, crime and disorder reduction partnerships and other agencies in the criminal justice system. In addition to its general strategic functions, the MPA set and monitored the annual police budget.\n\nIt consisted of 23 members: 12 [[London Assembly]] members, appointed by the [[Mayor of London]] in accordance with the political balance on the Assembly, four [[magistrate]]s, and seven independents.  The MPA was set up in 2000 as a functional body of the [[Greater London Authority]], by the [[Greater London Authority Act 1999]].  Previously control of the Metropolitan Police had vested entirely in the [[Home Secretary]].\n\nThe MPAs ceased to exist on 16 January 2012, when its functions were transferred to the [[Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime]] (MOPAC).<ref>[http://policeauthority.org/metropolitan/index.html Archive of the Metropolitan Police Authority website as it existed on 15 January 2012; when the functions of the MPA were transferred to the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC).]</ref>\n\n==Former members==\n* [[Kit Malthouse]] (Chair, London Assembly, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]])\n* Reshard Auladin OBE (Vice chair, independent)\n* John Roberts (independent)\n* [[Tony Arbour]] (London Assembly, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]])\n* [[Jennette Arnold]] (London Assembly, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]])\n* [[Victoria Borwick]] (London Assembly, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]])\n* [[James Cleverly]] (London Assembly, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]])\n* [[Dee Doocey]] (London Assembly, [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]])\n* [[Jenny Jones (Green politician)|Jenny Jones]] (London Assembly, [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]])\n* [[Joanne McCartney]] (London Assembly, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]])\n* [[Stephen O'Connell]] (London Assembly, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]])\n* [[Caroline Pidgeon]] (London Assembly, [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]])\n* Faith Boardman (independent)\n* Christopher Boothman (independent)\n* Valerie Brasse (independent)\n* Cindy Butts (independent)\n* [[Toby Harris, Baron Harris of Haringey|The Lord Harris of Haringey]] (independent)\n* Kirsten Hearn (independent)\n* Neil Johnson (independent)\n* Clive Lawton (independent)\n* Graham Speed (independent)\n* [[Len Duvall]] (?\u20132008)<ref>[http://www.greenwich.co.uk/magazine/len-duvall-interview/ Len Duvall interview], greenwich.co.uk, retrieved 18 July 2011.</ref>\n* Deborah Regal (2008\u20132010)<ref>[http://www.mpa.gov.uk/about/people/members/03regal/ Deborah Regal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318220939/http://www.mpa.gov.uk/about/people/members/03regal/ |date=18 March 2012 }}, Metropolitan Police Authority, retrieved 18 July 2011.</ref>\n* Richard Tracey (2008\u20132010)<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_assembly_member/news-richard-tracey-richard-tracey-joins-metropolitan-police-au Richard Tracey joins Metropolitan Police Authority] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502080445/http://www.london.gov.uk/media/press_releases_assembly_member/news-richard-tracey-richard-tracey-joins-metropolitan-police-au |date=2 May 2012 }}, london.gov.uk, retrieved 18 July 2011.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://policeauthority.org/metropolitan/index.html Metropolitan Police Authority]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140513231115/https://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/policing-crime/about-mopac Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime]\n\n{{GLA functional bodies}}\n\n[[Category:2000 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:2012 disestablishments in England]]\n[[Category:Greater London Authority functional bodies]]\n[[Category:History of local government in London]]\n[[Category:Metropolitan Police]]\n[[Category:Police authorities in England]]\n", "name_user": "Lotje", "label": "safe", "comment": "Filled in 2 bare reference(s) with reFill 2", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Authority"}
