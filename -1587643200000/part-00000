The [[Berlin Stadtbahn]] line is an elevated heavy rail line linking the East and the West. Long distance, regional, suburban, and urban services ([[S-Bahn]]) are operated on it.\n\nThe [[Wiener Stadtbahn]] (Vienna) was in the beginning a system of heavy rail lines circling the city, free of level crossings, operated by steam trains. After World War I the ''Wiental'', ''Donaukanal'' and ''G\u00fcrtel'' lines were converted into an electric light rail system with tram-like two-axle cars (which on line 18G until 1945 switched into the tram network at Gumpendorfer Strasse station). In the 1970s to 1990s the infrastructure was updated, and the lines were partially relocated: they are now part of the [[Vienna U-Bahn]] services 'U4' and 'U6'. The ''Vorortelinie'' line remained heavy rail and is now part of the [[Vienna S-Bahn]].\n\n=== 1960s: modern ''Stadtbahn'' ===\nSince the 1960s the term ''Stadtbahn'' has become identified with a second, now dominant, meaning, which is a reference to underground urban rail network that is used by conventional trams but planned at the outset to be eventually converted into a metro system (which may or may not be implemented in the end).\n\nPost-World War II transport policies in West German cities aimed for a separation of public and private transport. The conflicts that arose between increasing car usage and the existing tramway systems led to the so-called 'second level' concept for future light rail schemes.  This concept focused on the grade separation, i.e., elevation and/or tunneling of tram lines.\n\n[[Munich U-Bahn|Munich]] and [[Nuremberg U-Bahn|Nuremberg]] decided to build pure, full-scale [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] (metro) systems. [[Berlin U-Bahn|Berlin]] and [[Hamburg U-Bahn|Hamburg]] planned expansions of their existing U-Bahn networks, while most West German cities decided to upgrade their tramway networks step by step, linking new 'second level' infrastructure to existing sections.  While some cities regarded this solution as an interim step that would lead to a fully separated [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] (metro) network independent of other forms of transport, others planned for a lesser degree of separation, one that would accommodate additional tram-like sections in the long run. For both the interim and the long-term based concepts, the following terms came into use: \"U-Stra\u00dfenbahn\" or \"Untergrund-Stra\u00dfenbahn\" (underground tramway, abbreviated as \"U-Strab\"), \"Schnellstra\u00dfenbahn\" (rapid tramway) and finally ''Stadtbahn''. (In French-speaking countries, these concepts were also known as \"[[premetro|pre-metro]]\", stressing their interim nature.)\n\nSome operators and cities decided to identify the term ''Stadtbahn'' with the eventual goal of installing an [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] so that both the original U-Bahn logo (e.g. [[Frankfurt U-Bahn]], [[Cologne Stadtbahn]], [[Hanover Stadtbahn]]) and the derived ''U-Stadtbahn'' logos (e.g. [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Stuttgart Stadtbahn]]; see example above) mark station entries and stops. The numbering scheme for ''Stadtbahn'' services was prefixed with a 'U', except in the [[Cologne Stadtbahn]], [[Bielefeld Stadtbahn]], and [[Hanover Stadtbahn]].\n\n=== 1980s: Renaissance of the tramway ===\nBy the 1980s conventional tramways had been seen by decision-makers as overloaded systems for almost two decades.  However, public attention focused on them at this time for two reasons.\n\nThe ''Stadtbahn'' cities' second level plans faced unexpected complications in the form of lengthy construction work, budgetary problems for tunnel projects, and protests against elevated sections. At the same time, the smaller cities which had not started Stadtbahn plans reassessed their options in relation to their existing tram systems.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nEast German cities had no 1960s-style Stadtbahn plans in place, and the fleets and the infrastructure were in need of massive investment and improvement.  After the reunification of Germany in 1990, the use of the ''Stadtbahn'' term became popular in the former East Germany as well, as in [[Erfurt]] and [[Dresden]].\n\n''Stadtbahn'' in this wider meaning is thus not a clearly defined concept, but a vague one linked to a set of attributes, much in the same way that \"Stra\u00dfenbahn\" (tram) is linked to very different, sometimes mutually incompatible attributes.{{clarify|reason=The main definition of 'Stadtbahn' and 'light rail' is operation in exclusive rights-of-way - that is not vague.|date=October 2013}} A system that is called ''Stadtbahn'' today may not have all of the Stadtbahn attributes:  barrier-free access, higher cruising speed than tramways, doors on both sides of the train, driver's cabs on both ends, higher operating voltage, wider cars with comfortable seats, and so on.\n\n=== 1990s: The tram goes railway ===\nIn 1992 [[Karlsruhe]] started an innovative new service, using both heavy and light rail infrastructure, to link the wider region to the city. The vehicles were designed to comply with technical specifications for the (federal) heavy railway and for light rail (communal tramways). Such vehicles are called Dual-System Light Rail Vehicles. The meaning of Stadtbahn was enlarged to encompass this new type of \"[[tram-train]]\" service. In other regions, stimulated by the Karlsruhe example and planning to copy it, other terms are in use: Stadt-Umland-Bahn (city-to-region railway, e.g. [[Erlangen]], also in discussion to connect the nearer surroundings of [[Munich]], as far as not supplied with S-Bahn services so far, with the existing public transport there), ''Regional-Stadtbahn'' (regional light rail, e.g. [[Braunschweig]]).\n\nStra\u00dfenbahn (tram) and Stadtbahn in the [[Karlsruhe]] region are differentiated more by the nature of their city-border crossings only, and not by the technical dimension (Dual-System Light Rail Vehicles). Only those services that extend into the suburbs are called Stadtbahn. They are represented by the 'S' logo that is used for 'S-Bahn' (Stadtschnellbahn) in the rest of Germany and therefore partially conflict with it, as it has acquired a second meaning in Karlsruhe.\n\n=== 2000s: The Tram logo ===\n[[File:Tram-Logo.svg|thumb|144px|left|The Tram logo]]\nAs part of the redevelopment of their main city [[railway station|station]]s, national railway company [[Deutsche Bahn]] adopted a new logo to indicate ''Stra\u00dfenbahn'' (tram) connections: a square containing the word 'Tram'. Although the design is the same nationwide, the colour varies from city to city to match local public transport operators' systems of colour-coding. The logo is part of the 'S logo scheme' initially developed by [[Berlin]] public transport operator [[Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe|BVG]], based on the established logos for urban metro ('U', for ''U-Bahn'') and suburban metro ('S', for ''S-Bahn'') and including bus ('Bus') and ferry ('F', for ''F\u00e4hre'') operations.\n\nAs the new logos became part of the information systems at more and more main railway stations, an increasing number of cities and public transport operators came to accept and adopt the scheme. As far as the ''Stadtbahn'' terminology problem is concerned, however, the scheme serves only to add further confusion to the matter, since there is no nationwide logo for ''Stadtbahn'' services. The result appears to be a contraction in the use of the term ''Stadtbahn'', especially in cities where it has been used in its wider 1980s 'light-rail system' meaning.\n\nIn cities where ''Stadtbahn'' has the 1960s '[[premetro|pre-metro]]' meaning, both the 'U' (for U-Bahn) and the 'Tram' logo are used on city maps (to indicate the location of stops) and on railway station signage (to indicate connections). The 'U' Logo is normally used both where stops or stations are underground and where they serve 'second-level' pre-metro type lines. In cities which prefix all their ''Stadtbahn'' line numbers with a 'U' (e.g. [[Stuttgart]]), the 'U' logo is used at stops on services that are essentially 'classic' tram lines, not 'second-level' at all.\n\n== Regionalstadtbahn ==\nThe concept of ''Regionalstadtbahnen'' (also known by ''RegioStadtbahn'' or other names) arose as a result of the harmonisation or integration of railway lines into Stadtbahn networks. In the area of Cologne\u2013Bonn a single operational system (of so-called above ground lines or ''Hochflurstrecken'') was created by the [[Cologne Stadtbahn]] and the [[Bonn Stadtbahn]], opened in 1974, from the conversion of two former railway lines (the [[Rheinuferbahn]] and [[Vorgebirgsbahn]] belonging to the old [[K\u00f6ln-Bonner Eisenbahnen]]). Further developments led to ''[[tram-train]]'' networks that rather resembled an [[S-Bahn]]. This idea was first realised in 1992 in Karlsruhe ([[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]]), where as part of the [[Karlsruhe model]] even so-called [[Mehrsystemfahrzeug|dual system]] [[railbuses]] were used, which in addition to the [[direct current]] of Stra\u00dfenbahn lines (750 V) could also draw power from the 15-kV-[[alternating current]] from normal [[Deutsche Bahn|DB]] catenary. In Karlsruhe this network reached as far as [[Heilbronn]], {{convert|84|km|mi}} away, where a Stadtbahn network was created going out from this line. Both in Karlsruhe and in Heilbronn the Stadtbahn filled both the roles of a classic tramway system as well as an S-Bahn. The Karlsruhe mixed-operation concept was also adopted by the [[Saarbahn]] in [[Saarbr\u00fccken]]. This model is today referred to in France as the [[tram-train]].\n\n[[File:Zwickau TrainTram.jpg|thumb|[[Zwickau]] diesel tram-train ([[Vogtlandbahn]])]]\n\nOther Stadtbahn networks in Germany without tunnels, but which incorporate railway lines, are found in:\n\n* [[Kassel]] ([[Kassel RegioTram]] with hybrid railcars for the transition between electrified and non-electrified routes)\n* [[Zwickau]] (Diesel railbuses of the [[Vogtlandbahn]] on [[Trams in Zwickau|tramways in the city centre]])\n* [[Chemnitz]] ([[Variotram]]s [[Trams in Chemnitz|trams]] fitted with railway equipment, which City-Bahn Chemnitz runs daily on the Chemnitz\u2013[[Stollberg/Erzgeb.]] line)\n* [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]] ([[Trams in Gotha]]/Th\u00fcringerwaldbahn), above ground tramway (24&nbsp;km long), in existence since 1924, to [[Waltershausen]], [[Friedrichroda]] and [[Bad Tabarz]]\n* [[Nordhausen]] in the [[South Harz]]. This [[Trams in Nordhausen|tramway]] network run by the ''[[Harz Narrow Gauge Railways]]'' is notable because it supplements the diesel-hybrid cars with steam engines.\n\n== Legal terms ==\nAlthough a precise legal definition of ''Stadtbahn'' was planned in the 1970s, there is currently no such definition. By law, the [[BOStrab]] regulates all ''Stadtbahn'' systems as [[tram]] systems, as long as they are light rail rather than heavy rail.\n\n== Difference between Stadtbahn and S-Bahn in Germany ==\nWhile the names ''Stadtbahn'' and ''S-Bahn'' have common origin (''\"rapid urban train\"''), their meaning today is different. [[S-Bahn]] is [[commuter rail]], usually integrated into the railway network and mostly operated by the German national railway company [[Deutsche Bahn]].\n\n''Stadtbahn'', on the other hand, generally use [[light rail]] vehicles (either [[high-floor]] or [[low-floor]]), and are usually integrated into the tram network, though the Stadtbahn portions do not operate with [[street running]] like trams do.\n\nThey also differ in legal status: S-Bahn systems are governed under the rail rules of the [[Eisenbahn-Bau- und Betriebsordnung]] (EBO, ''\"Ordinance on the Construction and Operation of Railways\"''), while Stadtbahn systems are tramways by law governed under the regulations of [[Verordnung \u00fcber den Bau und Betrieb der Stra\u00dfenbahnen]] (BOStrab, ''\"Ordinance on the Construction and Operation of Trams\"'').\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Tram]]\n* [[Light rail]]\n* [[Premetro]]\n* [[Light metro]]\n* [[Tram-train]]\n* [[Train categories in Europe]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Stadtbahn systems}}\n\n{{Urban public transport in Germany}}\n\n[[Category:Rapid transit in Germany]]\n[[Category:Tram transport in Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the type of light rail system|suburban metro rail systems|S-Bahn|the railway line through Berlin|Berlin Stadtbahn}}\n{{italic title}}\n[[File:Stadtbahn.svg|right|thumb|Stadtbahn logo as used in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]]]\n\nA '''''{{lang|de|Stadtbahn}}''''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8\u0283tat\u02ccba\u02d0n}}; [[German language|German]] for \"city railway\"; plural ''{{lang|de|Stadtbahnen}}'') is a type of [[rail transport]].

[[S-Bahn]] is [[commuter rail]], usually integrated into the railway network and mostly operated by the German national railway company [[Deutsche Bahn]].\n\n''Stadtbahn'', on the other hand, generally use [[light rail]] vehicles (either [[high-floor]] or [[low-floor]]), and are usually integrated into the tram network, though the Stadtbahn portions do not operate with [[street running]] like trams do.\n\nThey also differ in legal status: S-Bahn systems are governed under the rail rules of the [[Eisenbahn-Bau- und Betriebsordnung]] (EBO, ''\"Ordinance on the Construction and Operation of Railways\"''), while Stadtbahn systems are tramways by law governed under the regulations of [[Verordnung \u00fcber den Bau und Betrieb der Stra\u00dfenbahnen]] (BOStrab, ''\"Ordinance on the Construction and Operation of Trams\"'').\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Tram]]\n* [[Light rail]]\n* [[Premetro]]\n* [[Light metro]]\n* [[Tram-train]]\n* [[Train categories in Europe]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Stadtbahn systems}}\n\n{{Urban public transport in Germany}}\n\n[[Category:Rapid transit in Germany]]\n[[Category:Tram transport in Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Fritz3721", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadtbahn"}

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''.

He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Midrasha", "text_new": "A '''''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{hebrew|\u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05d4}}, pl. ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot/midrashas}}'') is an institute of [[Torah study]] for women, generally in [[Israel]], and roughly the equivalent of a [[yeshiva]] for men. \nAn alternative term, and translation, is '[[seminary]]' ({{hebrew|\u05e1\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05e8}}); <ref name=\"science.co.il\">[https://www.science.co.il/jewish-studies/Midrashot.php ''Midrashot''], science.co.il</ref> these are modeled on the [[Sarah_Schenirer#Teacher's_Seminary|institution established by Sarah Schenirer]] in 1923.\n\"''Midrasha''\" is often associated with Religious Zionist institutions, while \"Seminary\" refers to ''[[Haredi]]'' institutions.\nA ''midrasha'' that offers [[academic degree|degree studies]] is sometimes called a ''machon'' ({{hebrew|\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df}}, institute).\n\nThe word \"''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''\" is based on the term ''[[beit midrash]]'', \"house of study\".  It is [[cognate]] with the [[Arabic]] \"''{{transl|ar|[[madrasa|madrasah]]}}'',\" which also refers to a place of learning.\n\nThe term ''Midrasha'' is sometimes used  more widely, referring to [[Cultural Judaism|pluralistic]], as opposed to [[orthodox Judaism|orthodox]], educational  institutions.\nIt may also refer to [[field school]]s that organize seminars and nature field trips.<ref name=\"science.co.il\"/>\n\n==Structure==\n===Curriculum===\n''{{lang|he-Latn|Midrashot}}'' and seminaries vary in curriculum and [[Orthodox Judaism#Social and philosophic differences|philosophy]]. \n<ref name=\"Lilith\">[https://www.lilith.org/blog/2014/09/a-modest-year-in-israel-when-young-women-go-to-seminary/ A Modest Year in Israel: When Young Women go to \u201cSeminary\u201d]. [[Lilith (magazine)|''Lilith'']], 2014 </ref>\nAll cover [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Halacha|Jewish law]]  and [[Musar Literature|Musar (Ethics)]] / [[Hasidic philosophy|''Hasidus'']].<ref name=\"science.co.il\"/> \nDepending on the institution's stance, the weight and role assigned to Talmud particularly, and in fact to textual-skills generally, will differ re men's yeshivot, and between ''midrashot''.<ref name=\"Lilith\"/>\nSee [[Yeshiva #Curriculum]] for the general content of each topic. \n\n[[Religious Zionist]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}'' include the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]]'s [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]], sister school of [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]].\nTreatment of Tanakh and Jewish philosophy, often referred to here as [[Jewish thought|''Machshava'']],  will typically be text-focused, built around [[chavruta]]-based study as at yeshivot.<ref name=\"Lilith\"/>\nThis entails paired-study where assigned sources are prepared for ''[[shiur]]'', a lecture delivered as a discursive-review.\nAt some institutions, [[Talmud]] is studied directly, also as at men's {{lang|he-Latn|[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]}}, if less intensively\n(see [[Women in Judaism #Joseph Solovetchik]]).\nRegardless, Jewish law will generally be studied with ''practice'' in view: i.e., as opposed to [[Yeshiva#Jewish_law|at a men's Yeshiva]], where the derivation is from Talmudic sources through codification \n(At [[Matan_Women's_Institute_for_Torah_Studies|Matan]], [[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] and [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] the treatment is Talmud-based;\nsee also [[Drisha Institute]].<ref>[https://www.drisha.co.il/ drisha.co.il]: \"\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e0\u05e9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05de\u05d1\u05e7\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea \u05dc\u05d4\u05e2\u05de\u05d9\u05e7 \u05d5\u05dc\u05d2\u05d3\u05d5\u05dc \u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4\"</ref>)\n''Midrashot'' additionally focus on the writings of [[Rav Kook]], and ''[[Torat Eretz Yisrael]]'' in general.\n\nThe [[Haredi]] aligned seminaries - for example [[Beth Jacob Jerusalem]] - are modeled on the [[Beis Yaakov]] teacher-training seminary established by [[Sarah Schenirer]].\n(''Beis Yaakov'' almost invariably refers to high school, while \"Seminary\" is used for a post-high school institution.)\nSeminaries are typically more conservative in their approach than ''Midrashot'':\nselections from the Talmud may be studied, but only in the context of other classes, especially philosophy and Musar; \nthese institutions then also assign less weight to textual skills,<ref name=\"Lilith\"/> with content delivered primarily via lecture.\n(See [[Bais Yaakov #Curriculum]], [[Women in Judaism #Yisrael Meir Kagan]].)\n[[Bais_Yaakov#Hasidic_schools|Hasidic-aligned institutions]], for example [[Beth Rivkah]], are similarly positioned; their curricula differ in that they emphasize the works of their respective [[Rebbe]]. \nParallel to their academic content, most Seminaries also focus on [[Hashkafa#Gender_roles|the role of women in Torah]] - covering topics such as ''[[Tzniut]]'' (modesty), ''[[Shalom Bayit]]'' (\"domestic peace\") and ''[[Chinuch]]'' (education of one's children) - with these classes emphasizing ''values'', as opposed to sources. <ref name=\"Lilith\"/>\n(Several ''Midrashot'' similarly.<ref name =\"tal\"/>)\n\nMany diaspora-based Orthodox Jewish girls attend a ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}'', or \u201csem\u201d, in Israel for a year or more following high school;

However, music channels were unwilling to play it at the time and eventually reached an agreement to play it extensively from December onwards. Consequently, Jay Sean pushed back the single's release date as well as the album's release date. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.\n\nThe song, produced by [[Alan Sampson]],<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/sampsonmusic Official MySpace of the producer Alan Sampson]</ref> became Song of the Week on London's [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss 100]] on 10 December 2007 and was also playlisted on [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital 95.8FM]], [[Choice FM]], [[The Galaxy Network|Galaxy]], [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|BBC 1Xtra]], and being featured on [[BBC Radio 1|BBC Radio 1's]] B-list. It reached the number one spot on MTV's The Base Chart Show. Later, a [[Hindi]] version of the song was added to [[YouTube]].\n\nSean said of this song: \"It started off with me in the studio with a rap, jumping around like a joker. It's all about the games people play across the dancefloor on a night out \u2013 how you can catch someone's eye and accept a challenge that lasts the rest of the evening.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nThe intro and the epic melody background was based on the ''Hero''<ref>[[Hero (2002 film)]]</ref> soundtrack by [[Tan Dun]].<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCkbfapn-I4</ref> Some of the scenes in the video were shot in [[Manhattan]].\n\nThe song appears to have a second version with shorter play time and changed lyrics in its third verse.\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for the single was shot on 12 August 2007 in the central London nightclub Mo*Vida. On 28 September 2007, the video was exclusively available to watch on 3G mobile handsets and on 9 October 2007 was officially released to the internet by [[2Point9 Records]]. The new video featured Jay Sean with a new style after being out of the limelight for nearly three and a half years.\nOn 28 September 2007, the video was exclusively available to watch on 3G mobile handsets. A clip of the video was added to the 2Point9 YouTube Channel on 29 September 2007.\n\nBy 9 October 2007, the full video was added onto the 2Point9 YouTube Channel. The video premiered on The Box and other music channels in December. It starts off with Jay Sean arriving outside a club, the video is interspersed with a scene of Jay in a dark hallway. He flirts with a woman played by the British Victoria's Secret model, Anara Atanes and then a dance ensues, the video ends with the girl arriving by his side.\n\n==Formats and track listings==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! # !!
