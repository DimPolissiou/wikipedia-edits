It is also related to [[Surigaonon language|Surigaonon]] and Butuanon.\n\nDialect variations are caused by mixed dialect communications between the [[Mandaya]], [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]] and other immigrants now living in the area. A prefix is added in most adjectives. Example: The word ''gamay'' in Cebuano (English: \"small\") is ''gamayay'' in Baganga. But you can't use the \"''ay''\" prefix often, like for instance the word ''dako'' (English; \"big\") is spoken as \"''bagas-AY''\" or \"''bagasay''\" instead of saying \"''dako-ay''\". dutayay (English: \"very small\")\n\n==See also==\n* [[Baganga Protected Landscape]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111003154243/http://www.baganga.gov.ph/ Official Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120413163013/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081120024509/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/census2007/index.html Philippine Census Information]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120425060002/http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=14&frmIdProvince=77&frmIdLgu=1454 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Centre    = Baganga\n| North     = [[Cateel, Davao Oriental|Cateel]]\n| East      = ''[[Philippine Sea]]''\n| South     = [[Caraga, Davao Oriental|Caraga]]\n| West      = [[New Bataan, Compostela Valley]]\n| Northwest = [[Compostela, Compostela Valley]]\n}}\n{{Davao Oriental}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Davao Oriental]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n| name                   = {{PH wikidata|name}} \n| image_skyline          =  \n| image_caption          = \n| image_seal             =   \n| seal_size              = 100x80px\n| image_map              = {{PH wikidata|image_map}}\n| map_caption            = {{PH wikidata|map_caption}}\n| image_map1             = {{Infobox mapframe|id={{#invoke:Wikibase|id}}}}\n| pushpin_map            = Philippines\n| pushpin_label_position = left\n| pushpin_map_caption    = Location within the {{PH wikidata|country}}\n| coordinates            = {{PH wikidata|coordinates}}\n| settlement_type        = {{PH wikidata|settlement_type}}\n| subdivision_type       = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name       = {{flag|Philippines}}\n| subdivision_type1      = [[Regions of the Philippines|Region]]\n| subdivision_name1      = {{PH wikidata|region}}\n| subdivision_type2      = [[Provinces of the Philippines|Province]]\n| subdivision_name2      = {{PH wikidata|province}}\n| official_name          = {{PH wikidata|official_name}}\n| etymology              =  <!--origin of name-->\n| named_for              =  <!--named after (if person or place)-->\n| native_name            =\n| other_name             =\n| nickname               =\n| motto                  =\n| anthem                 =\n| subdivision_type3      = [[House of Representatives of the Philippines#District representation|District]]\n| subdivision_name3      = [[Legislative districts of Davao Oriental|1st District]]\n| established_title      = Founded\n| established_date       = <!--foundation date-->\n| parts_type             = [[Barangay]]s\n| parts_style            = para\n| p1                     = 18 (see [[#Barangays|Barangays]])\n| leader_title           = {{PH wikidata|leader_title}} <!--mayor-->\n| leader_name            = Arturo C.

The Southern Kamayo is quite different from the [[Kamayo language]] of [[Bislig]], Surigao Del Sur. Southern Kamayo is also spoken in Southern [[Lingig, Surigao del Sur]], in Cateel, Caraga and some parts of Davao Oriental. It is also related to [[Surigaonon language|Surigaonon]] and Butuanon.\n\nDialect variations are caused by mixed dialect communications between the [[Mandaya]], [[Cebuano people|Cebuano]] and other immigrants now living in the area. A prefix is added in most adjectives. Example: The word ''gamay'' in Cebuano (English: \"small\") is ''gamayay'' in Baganga. But you can't use the \"''ay''\" prefix often, like for instance the word ''dako'' (English; \"big\") is spoken as \"''bagas-AY''\" or \"''bagasay''\" instead of saying \"''dako-ay''\". dutayay (English: \"very small\")\n\n==See also==\n* [[Baganga Protected Landscape]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111003154243/http://www.baganga.gov.ph/ Official Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120413163013/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081120024509/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/census2007/index.html Philippine Census Information]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120425060002/http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=14&frmIdProvince=77&frmIdLgu=1454 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Centre    = Baganga\n| North     = [[Cateel, Davao Oriental|Cateel]]\n| East      = ''[[Philippine Sea]]''\n| South     = [[Caraga, Davao Oriental|Caraga]]\n| West      = [[New Bataan, Compostela Valley]]\n| Northwest = [[Compostela, Compostela Valley]]\n}}\n{{Davao Oriental}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Davao Oriental]]\n", "name_user": "P199", "label": "safe", "comment": "map formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baganga"}

Neasden also includes [[Brent Park]] and [[St Raphael's Estate]].\n\n==History==\nThe area was recorded as ''Neasdun'' in AD 939 and the name is derived from the [[Old English]] ''n\u0113os'' = 'nose' and ''d\u016bn'' = 'hill'. It means 'the nose-shaped hill' referring to a well-defined landmark of this area. In 1750, it was known as ''Needsden'' and the present spelling appeared at a later date.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.brent-heritage.co.uk/neasden.htm|title=Neasden, area in the London Borough of Brent|website=www.brent-heritage.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nNeasden was a countryside hamlet on the western end of the [[Dollis Hill]] ridge. The land was owned by [[St. Paul's Cathedral]]. In medieval times, the village consisted only of several small buildings around the green near the site of the present Neasden roundabout.\n\nIn the 15th\u201317th century the Roberts family were the major landowners in the area. Thomas Roberts erected Neasden House (on the site of the modern Clifford Court) in the reign of Henry VIII.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://212.85.23.227/Heritage.nsf/24878f4b00d4f0f68025663c006c7944/8c28e2ce1fbd853280256b2100378344/$FILE/Neasden.PDF|title=Wayback Machine|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\nIn 1651 Sir [[William Roberts (parliamentarian)|William Roberts]] bought confiscated church lands. After the Restoration the estates were returned to the ownership of the Church but were leased out to the Roberts family.

The decline in industry through the 1970s also contributed to the area's decline. But nonetheless Neasden has survived, largely due to a succession of vibrant immigrant communities keeping the local economy afloat.

Since early in its history (when the magazine was actually printed in Neasden) the magazine has used Neasden as an exemplar of the suburban environment in pieces parodying current events, personalities, and [[social mores]] (for example, the [[University of Neasden]]). Spoof sports reports in the magazine usually feature the perennially unsuccessful football team, [[Neasden F.C.]] with their manager, \"ashen-faced\" Ron Knee and their only two supporters, Sid and Doris Bonkers.\n\n;Metro-land\nNeasden was one of the locations in the TV documentary [[Metro-land (TV)]]. In it, Sir [[John Betjeman]] described Neasden as \"home of the gnome and the average citizen\" (the former a reference to the preponderance of gnome statuettes in suburban front-gardens, but possibly also a nod in the direction of the Eye's fictional proprietor, Lord Gnome). Background music was provided by [[Willie Rushton|William Rushton]]\u2019s recording of Neasden (1972) (\"Neasden/You won\u2019t be sorry that you breezed in\").\n\n;BBC Radiophonic Workshop\nIn a celebrated spoof of the [[Early Music]] phenomenon which grew enormously in the late 1960s, Neasden was selected by [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] composer [[David Cain (composer)|David Cain]] as the home of a fictional ensemble dedicated to [[historically-informed performance]]s on authentic musical instruments from an indeterminate number of centuries ago. It was thus that in 1968, listeners to [[BBC Radio 3]] were given a recital by the Schola Polyphonica Neasdeniensis whose members performed on the equally fictional Shagbut, Minikin and Flemish Clackett.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011105130132/http://www.hnewbury.uklinux.net/music.htm Music matters - Hugh Newbury]</ref>\n\n;Athletico Neasden\n[[Athletico Neasden]] was an amateur football team of mostly Jewish players, which played in the [[Maccabi (sports)|Maccabi]] (Southern) Football League in the 1970s and 1980s and was named after the place, though it did not actually play in the area.

There the [[Colossus computer|Colossus]] computers, among the world's first, were built in 1943-1944 and underneath it the [[Paddock (war rooms)|Paddock]] wartime cabinet rooms were constructed in 1939.\n\n[[Neasden Power Station]], which was built to provide power for the Metropolitan Railway, was closed and demolished in 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ltmcollection.org/photos/themes/theme_sub.html?IXtoptheme=Power+stations&IXrefine=Neasden|title=404 - Page not found - London Transport Museum|first=altcom|last=Support|website=www.ltmcollection.org}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, a new housing estate called [[St Raphael's Estate]] was built west of the North Circular Road and east of [[Wembley]].\n\nThe post-war history of Neasden is one of steady decline; local traffic congestion problems necessitated the building of an underpass on the North Circular Road that effectively cut Neasden in half and had a disastrous effect on the shopping centre by making pedestrian access to it difficult. The decline in industry through the 1970s also contributed to the area's decline. But nonetheless Neasden has survived, largely due to a succession of vibrant immigrant communities keeping the local economy afloat. [[Neasden Depot]] continues to be the main storage and maintenance depot for the [[London Underground]]'s [[Metropolitan line]] (and is also used by trains of the [[Jubilee line]]); it is London Underground's largest depot<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metronetrail.com/default.asp?sID=1086172287703|title=Metronet Rail - Having Outstanding Brand|website=Metronet Rail}}</ref> and as such it is a major local employer.\n\n===Recent history===\nThe Grange Tavern (previously called The Old Spotted Dog) on Neasden Lane was closed in the 1990s and demolished to make way for a block of flats, bringing to an end the inn that had stood there for around two centuries. Another old pub, The Pantiles which stood on the North Circular Road was converted to another McDonald's restaurant. The Swedish furniture retailer, [[IKEA]] opened its second UK outlet in Neasden in 1988.\n\nOn 14 July 1993 in an [[MI5]] anti-terrorist operation, a [[Provisional IRA]] man was arrested in his car on Crest Road carrying a 20 lb bomb. It came just over a year after the [[1992 Staples Corner bombing|Staples Corner bombing]] just over 500 yards away, which devastated the junction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0004000337014|title=IRA bombers foiled by MI5 \u00b7 British Universities Film & Video Council|website=bufvc.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Neasden became the home of the biggest Hindu temple outside India: the [[Neasden Temple]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | image1            = Neasden Lane, NW10.jpg\n | caption1          = Neasden Lane North, circa 1987\n | image2            = Neasden facing towards Blackbird Hill.jpg\n | caption2          = Around the same spot on Neasden Lane North, 2005\n}}\nThe area around Neasden Lane North was for a while terrorised by a local gang called \"Press Road Crew\" who carried knives, dealt drugs and performed vandalism. In 2003, seven members were caught and were banned from the streets they were active in, including [[Chalkhill Estate]] in [[Wembley Park]], in the then biggest (by area size) [[anti-social behaviour order]] in Britain.<ref>https://www.standard.co.uk/news/gang-named-and-shamed-7234930.html</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the Shopping Centre area was partially redeveloped by the council in an effort to reverse its fortunes. The Grange, which had housed a community museum about the people of Brent was closed by the council in 2005. The building is now a restaurant with its namesake, located inside the Neasden roundabout.<ref>http://grangeneasden.co.uk/</ref> The 2004 redevelopment proved to be unpopular with local businesses as it changed the layouts of parking, thus forcing customers and local trade to pass by due to the parking restrictions of the redevelopment.\n\nAn author for the ''[[New Statesman]]'' called Neasden a \"prime example of what happens when a big road [North Circular] both carves up and strangles an area.\"<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2018/08/dreams-don-t-come-neasden-die-they-could-never-have-lived-here-first-place</ref>\n\n==Neasden in popular culture==\n\n;\"The loneliest village in London\"\nNeasden was once nicknamed \u2018the loneliest village in London\u2019.<ref name=\"Hidden London\"/>\n\n;Private Eye\nNeasden has achieved considerable notoriety thanks to the British [[satire|satirical]] magazine, ''[[Private Eye]]''. Since early in its history (when the magazine was actually printed in Neasden) the magazine has used Neasden as an exemplar of the suburban environment in pieces parodying current events, personalities, and [[social mores]] (for example, the [[University of Neasden]]). Spoof sports reports in the magazine usually feature the perennially unsuccessful football team, [[Neasden F.C.]] with their manager, \"ashen-faced\" Ron Knee and their only two supporters, Sid and Doris Bonkers.\n\n;Metro-land\nNeasden was one of the locations in the TV documentary [[Metro-land (TV)]]. In it, Sir [[John Betjeman]] described Neasden as \"home of the gnome and the average citizen\" (the former a reference to the preponderance of gnome statuettes in suburban front-gardens, but possibly also a nod in the direction of the Eye\u2019s fictional proprietor, Lord Gnome). Background music was provided by [[Willie Rushton|William Rushton]]\u2019s recording of Neasden (1972) (\"Neasden/You won\u2019t be sorry that you breezed in\").\n\n;BBC Radiophonic Workshop\nIn a celebrated spoof of the [[Early Music]] phenomenon which grew enormously in the late 1960s, Neasden was selected by [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] composer [[David Cain (composer)|David Cain]] as the home of a fictional ensemble dedicated to [[historically-informed performance]]s on authentic musical instruments from an indeterminate number of centuries ago. It was thus that in 1968, listeners to [[BBC Radio 3]] were given a recital by the Schola Polyphonica Neasdeniensis whose members performed on the equally fictional Shagbut, Minikin and Flemish Clackett.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011105130132/http://www.hnewbury.uklinux.net/music.htm Music matters - Hugh Newbury]</ref>\n\n;Athletico Neasden\n[[Athletico Neasden]] was an amateur football team of mostly Jewish players, which played in the [[Maccabi (sports)|Maccabi]] (Southern) Football League in the 1970s and 1980s and was named after the place, though it did not actually play in the area. The team eventually merged with North West Warriors to form North West Neasden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tffc.co.uk/NewFiles/ripmsflclubs.html|title=Temple Fortune Football Club|website=www.tffc.co.uk}}</ref> (See also&nbsp;\u2014 Son of Neasden and Neasden Academicals).\n\n;Literature\nDavid Sutherland\u2019s children\u2019s novel 'A Black Hole in Neasden' reveals a gateway to another planet in a Neasden back garden.
