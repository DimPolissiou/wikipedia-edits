The [[baseball]] and [[American football|football]] teams, and the vaudeville presentations and concerts, were funded through revenue from paid attendance. [[Tim Mara]], the owner of the [[New York Giants]], sponsored the '''Sing Sing Black Sheep''', Sing Sing's football team. Mara provided equipment and uniforms and players to tutor them in fundamentals. He helped coach them the first season. Known as the Black Sheep, they were also sometimes called the Zebras. All games were \"home\" games, played at Lawes Stadium, named for Warden [[Lewis E. Lawes]]. In 1935, the starting quarterback and two other starters escaped the morning before a game.\n\n[[Alabama Pitts]] was their starting QB and star for the first four seasons, but then finished his sentence. Upon release, Alabama Pitts played for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in 1935. In 1932, \"graduate\" [[Jumbo Morano]] was signed by the Giants, and played for the [[Paterson Nighthawks]] of the [[Eastern Football League (United States)|Eastern Football League]]. In 1934, State Commissioner of Correction, [[Walter N. Thayer]] banned the advertising of activities at the prison, including football games. On November 19, 1936, a new rule banned ticket sales. No revenue would be allowed on admission to shows and sports events. This money was paying for charity for prisoners' families, especially the executed's kin, and for equipment and coaches' salaries. With this new edict, the season ended and prisoners were no longer allowed to play football outside Sing Sing.<ref>''Sing Sing Football Records'': [http://www.luckyshow.org/football/Sing%20Sing.htm \"Sing Sing\"].

It was John Luckey, the Prison Chaplain around 1843, who held the Principal Keeper of Sing Sing, Elam Lynds, accountable to New York Governor William H. Seward and to President of the Board of Inspectors, John Edmonds, to have Lynds removed. Chaplain Luckey proceeded to create a great religious library. His purpose was to teach correct moral principles.<ref>Adam Jay Hirsch, ''The Rise of the Penitentiary: Prisons and Punishment in Early America'', New Haven and London (1992).</ref> His religious library was challenged in 1844 when John Edmonds placed [[Eliza Farnham]] in charge of the women's ward at Sing Sing. 1844 was the year the New York Prison Association was inaugurated to monitor state prison administration.  The NY Prison Association was made up of reformists interested in the rehabilitation and humane treatment of prisoners. Eliza Farnham was able to obtain the job largely on the recommendation of these reformists.<ref>Floyd, Janet, \"Dislocations of the self: Eliza Farnham at Sing Sing Prison\", ''Journal of American Studies'' (2006), 40(02), p. 311 (311.doi:10,1017/S0021875806001393).</ref> Eliza Farnham overturned the strictly silent practice in prison and introduced social engagement to shift concern more toward the future instead of dwelling on the criminal past. She included novels by [[Charles Dickens]] in Chaplain Luckey's religious library, novels the chaplain did not approve.

In this collection, Dolce drew upon his Sicilian roots. The collection's advertising campaign was shot by photographer [[Ferdinando Scianna]] in Sicily, and featured Dutch model [[Marpessa Hennink]] in black and white pictures<ref name=italia>{{cite journal|last1=Locatelli|first1=Rossella|title=Marpessa - Vogue Italia Encyclo|journal=Vogue Italia|url=http://www.vogue.it/en/encyclo/people/m/marpessa|accessdate=7 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411185716/http://www.vogue.it/en/encyclo/people/m/marpessa|archive-date=11 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=clase>{{cite journal|last1=Mu\u00f1oz Martinez-Mora|first1=Ines|title=Marpessa Clase Superior|journal=Vogue Espa\u00f1a|date=May 2013|pages=206\u2013216|trans-title=Marpessa Top Class|language=Spanish}}</ref> inspired by the Italian cinema of the 1940s.

It is considered to be the most representative piece of this era for the brand. Rubenstein described the piece in 2012 by writing, \"The Sicilian dress is the essence of Dolce & Gabbana, the brand's sartorial touchstone. The dress takes its cue from a slip\u2014but it's a slip that's adorned [[Anna Magnani]], and it's a silhouette that has graced [[Anita Ekberg]], [[Sophia Loren]], [and so forth]. The straps fit tight to the body just as bra straps would; the neckline runs straight across but gets waylaid at least twice, once on each side to caress each breast and in the middle to meet an uplifting tuck that's giving a gentle push up. The slip doesn't just slide down, but comes in at the waist to hold the figure firmly but not too tightly and then widens to emphasise the hips, only to fall with a slight taper at the knees to guarantee that the hips will sway when the wearer walks.\"<ref name=HB>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KvzSrWl5QP0C&pg=PT202&dq=dolce+and+gabbana+collection#v=onepage&q=dolce%20and%20gabbana%20collection&f=false |title=100 Unforgettable Dresses |author=Hal Rubenstein |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2012|isbn=9780062198884 }}</ref>\n\n=== The 1980s and 1990s ===\nIn 1987, the two launched a separate knitwear line and in 1989, they started designing a lingerie line and a beachwear line. Two years later, they launched their leotard line. In 1989, Dolce & Gabbana opened their first store in Japan in partnership with Kashiyama Co. They started to export their products to the United States, where they founded their own showroom in 1990. In 1992, the same year that they presented their men\u2019s collection, they also launched their first perfume Dolce & Gabbana. They won an \u201cOscar des Parfums\u201d for best male perfume in 1996 from the French Parfum Academy, the first time ever that the title has been awarded to an Italian brand. Towards the end of the 1990s their sales were around $500 million and in 2003 alone, their revenue reached $633.2 million.\nIn 1990, they launched their first men's collection.<ref name=VSB /> That year, they also moved the design house into its first official offices and began to design gowns and other more expensive pieces in addition to their original clothing.<ref name=MGNYM /> Their 1990 Spring/Summer women's collection referenced the mythological painting of [[Raphael]], and the duo began to build a reputation for crystal-encrusted clothing. The 1991 Fall/Winter women's collection was also adorned by trinkets, including [[filigree]] medals and embellished [[corset]]s. The 1992 Fall/Winter women's collection was then inspired by the silver screen of the 1950s, though the collection still included crystal embellished body suits.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.swide.com/luxury-magazine/History/DG-Archive/dg-archive-embellishments/2011/11/27 |work=Swide Magazine |date=27 November 2011 |accessdate=19 May 2012 |title=Dolce & Gabbana and their Private Renaissance |author=Valentina Zannoni}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, their men's collection was awarded the Woolmark Award for the most innovative men's collection of the year.<ref name=BIOCH /> What is considered to be their first foray into international recognition came when [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] wore a corset made of gemstones and an accompanying jacket from Dolce & Gabbana at the 1991 [[New York City]] premiere of ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Truth or Dare]]: In Bed with Madonna''.

[[Sicily]] and [[Sicilian culture]] is the most important style and identity of Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nD & G trademarks include [[underwear-as-outerwear]] (such as corsets and bra fastenings), gangster boss [[pinstripe]] suits, and extravagantly printed coats. Meanwhile, their feminine collections are always backed by powerful ad campaigns, like the black-and-white ads featuring model Marpessa photographed by Ferdinando Scianna in 1987 (Dolce & Gabbana). \"They find their way out of any black dress, any buttoned-up blouse (Domenico),\" says Rossellini. \"The first piece of theirs I wore was a white shirt, very chaste, but cut to make my breasts look as if they were bursting out of it (Domenico).\"\n\nOnce dubbed the \"Gilbert and George of Italian fashion\",<ref name=AAA>{{cite news |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/spy/biographies/dolce-and-gabbana-biography |title=Dolce & Gabbana |author=Jo Craven |date=11 May 2011 |work=Vogue UK |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> Dolce & Gabbana gave their fashion interests a musical turn in 1996, by recording their own single, in which they intoned the words \"D&G is love\" over a techno beat (Dolce & Gabbana 2011).

It is considered to be the most representative piece of this era for the brand. Rubenstein described the piece in 2012 by writing, \"The Sicilian dress is the essence of Dolce & Gabbana, the brand's sartorial touchstone. The dress takes its cue from a slip\u2014but it's a slip that's adorned [[Anna Magnani]], and it's a silhouette that has graced [[Anita Ekberg]], [[Sophia Loren]], [and so forth]. The straps fit tight to the body just as bra straps would; the neckline runs straight across but gets waylaid at least twice, once on each side to caress each breast and in the middle to meet an uplifting tuck that's giving a gentle push up. The slip doesn't just slide down, but comes in at the waist to hold the figure firmly but not too tightly and then widens to emphasise the hips, only to fall with a slight taper at the knees to guarantee that the hips will sway when the wearer walks.\"<ref name=HB>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KvzSrWl5QP0C&pg=PT202&dq=dolce+and+gabbana+collection#v=onepage&q=dolce%20and%20gabbana%20collection&f=false |title=100 Unforgettable Dresses |author=Hal Rubenstein |publisher=Harper Collins |year=2012|isbn=9780062198884 }}</ref>\n\n=== The 1980s and 1990s ===\nIn 1987, the two launched a separate knitwear line and in 1989, they started designing a lingerie line and a beachwear line. Two years later, they launched their leotard line. In 1989, Dolce & Gabbana opened their first store in Japan in partnership with Kashiyama Co. They started to export their products to the United States, where they founded their own showroom in 1990. In 1992, the same year that they presented their men\u2019s collection, they also launched their first perfume Dolce & Gabbana. They won an \u201cOscar des Parfums\u201d for best male perfume in 1996 from the French Parfum Academy, the first time ever that the title has been awarded to an Italian brand. Towards the end of the 1990s their sales were around $500 million and in 2003 alone, their revenue reached $633.2 million.\nIn 1990, they launched their first men's collection.<ref name=VSB /> That year, they also moved the design house into its first official offices and began to design gowns and other more expensive pieces in addition to their original clothing.<ref name=MGNYM /> Their 1990 Spring/Summer women's collection referenced the mythological painting of [[Raphael]], and the duo began to build a reputation for crystal-encrusted clothing. The 1991 Fall/Winter women's collection was also adorned by trinkets, including [[filigree]] medals and embellished [[corset]]s. The 1992 Fall/Winter women's collection was then inspired by the silver screen of the 1950s, though the collection still included crystal embellished body suits.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.swide.com/luxury-magazine/History/DG-Archive/dg-archive-embellishments/2011/11/27 |work=Swide Magazine |date=27 November 2011 |accessdate=19 May 2012 |title=Dolce & Gabbana and their Private Renaissance |author=Valentina Zannoni}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, their men's collection was awarded the Woolmark Award for the most innovative men's collection of the year.<ref name=BIOCH /> What is considered to be their first foray into international recognition came when [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] wore a corset made of gemstones and an accompanying jacket from Dolce & Gabbana at the 1991 [[New York City]] premiere of ''[[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Truth or Dare]]: In Bed with Madonna''.

[[Sicily]] and [[Sicilian culture]] is the most important style and identity of Dolce & Gabbana.\n\nD & G trademarks include [[underwear-as-outerwear]] (such as corsets and bra fastenings), gangster boss [[pinstripe]] suits, and extravagantly printed coats. Meanwhile, their feminine collections are always backed by powerful ad campaigns, like the black-and-white ads featuring model Marpessa photographed by Ferdinando Scianna in 1987 (Dolce & Gabbana). \"They find their way out of any black dress, any buttoned-up blouse (Domenico),\" says Rossellini. \"The first piece of theirs I wore was a white shirt, very chaste, but cut to make my breasts look as if they were bursting out of it (Domenico).\"\n\nOnce dubbed the \"Gilbert and George of Italian fashion\",<ref name=AAA>{{cite news |url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/spy/biographies/dolce-and-gabbana-biography |title=Dolce & Gabbana |author=Jo Craven |date=11 May 2011 |work=Vogue UK |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> Dolce & Gabbana gave their fashion interests a musical turn in 1996, by recording their own single, in which they intoned the words \"D&G is love\" over a techno beat (Dolce & Gabbana 2011). Newer to the design game than other heavyweight Italian fashion houses such as [[Armani]] and [[Versace]], the pair acknowledge that luck has played its part in their phenomenal success. By 1997, their company reported a turnover of \u20ac400 million, prompting both designers to announce that they planned to retire by the age of 40 \u2013 a promise they did not keep (Domenico).\n\nAfter the designers spotted a Veneziano painting of Christ on the cross wearing a pair of their branded underwear briefs in the Venice Biennale, they commissioned the artist to do a portrait of them with the Madonna portrayed as the likeness of the chanteuse and performer [[Madonna Ciccone]] and the courtiers as two putti at her feet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/758548c8-5d54-11e1-889d-00144feabdc0.html|title=Lunch with the FT: Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana|work=Financial Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.10magazine.com/article/15176531624/dolce-gabbana-art-house|title=10 Magazine|work=10magazine.com}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2016, the company launched a high-end fashion range aimed at wealthy Muslim women featuring a collection of hijabs and abayas printed with daisies, lemons and roses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/07/dolce-gabbana-debuts-luxury-hijab-collection|title=Dolce & Gabbana launches luxury hijab collection|last=Gani|first=Aisha|date=7 January 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|accessdate=9 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Books ==\nIn addition to designing clothing, Dolce & Gabbana have co-authored nearly two dozen books featuring photographic narratives as well as collections of their own work.
