[[Hurricane Wilma]] first developed on October&nbsp;15 in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Four days later, it strengthened into the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record, as measured by [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]]. Wilma weakened as it moved slowly northwestward, eventually making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] late on October&nbsp;21 on the island of [[Cozumel]] as a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]]. Early the next day, the hurricane made another landfall on the Mexican mainland near [[Puerto Morelos]]. Wilma exited the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on October&nbsp;23, and a day later struck [[Florida]].\n\nThe large and powerful hurricane dropped torrential rainfall across the northeastern Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and on nearby offshore islands. Over a 24&nbsp;hour period, Wilma dropped {{convert|1633.98|mm|in|abbr=on}} worth of rainfall, which was the great 24&nbsp;hour accumulation ever recorded in the [[western hemisphere]]. Wilma lashed parts of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula with hurricane-force winds for 50&nbsp;hours. The hurricane produced Mexico's strongest wind gust ever recorded, when an [[anemometer]] recorded a reading of 212&nbsp;km/h (132&nbsp;mph) before the instrument failed. Wind gusts were estimated as high as {{convert|230|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The hurricane moved ashore with an estimated {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[storm surge]], along with {{convert|5|to|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} waves which reached the third story of some buildings. Wilma severely eroded the beaches of eastern Quintana Roo and also caused flooding in neighboring [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]] state.\n\nWilma contributed to eight deaths in Mexico \u2013 seven in Quintana Roo and one in Yucat\u00e1n. The direct impacts of Hurricane Wilma inflicted about $4.8&nbsp;billion ([[Mexican peso|MXN]], [[United States dollar|US$]]454&nbsp;million) worth of damage, mostly in Quintana Roo, where it was the state's costliest natural disaster. Much of the damage was to tourist areas of [[Canc\u00fan]] and other nearby resort areas. The hurricane's indirect costs were significantly higher due to its disruption of tourism revenue, estimated at $13.9&nbsp;billion (US$1.3&nbsp;billion). About 98% of the hotels and resorts in Quintana Roo were damaged, including 110&nbsp;hotels damaged or destroyed in Canc\u00fan. Nationwide, Wilma destroyed 4,571&nbsp;houses and caused damage to 28,980&nbsp;other homes. In Canc\u00fan alone, the hurricane left 300,000&nbsp;people homeless. \n\n==Background and preparations==\n[[File:Wilma in cozumel island-109920 m.jpg|right|thumb|The [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of Hurricane Wilma moving over [[Cozumel]]]]\n[[Hurricane Wilma]] developed on October&nbsp;15, 2005 in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Four days later, it strengthened into a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]], with the lowest recorded [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] of any Atlantic hurricane; the [[Hurricane Hunters]] recorded a minimum pressure of {{convert|882|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}. Wilma weakened as it drifted northwestward through the Caribbean over the next two days.<ref name=\"TCR\"/> Originally, the hurricane was projected to move through the [[Yucat\u00e1n Channel]] between Mexico and Cuba, but it maintained its northwest trajectory.<ref name=\"mexdam\"/> Wilma made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] late on October&nbsp;21 on the island of [[Cozumel]]; the NHC estimated the landfall intensity at {{Convert|927|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}, with [[maximum sustained winds]] of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h), making it a [[List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes|Category&nbsp;4]]. Early on October&nbsp;22, Wilma made a second landfall on the [[Quintana Roo]] mainland near [[Puerto Morelos]]. It then drifted across the northeastern Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, emerging into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on October&nbsp;23. The hurricane later moved to the northeast, striking [[Florida]] on October&nbsp;24. It accelerated northeastward across the Atlantic Ocean, becoming an [[extratropical cyclone]] on October&nbsp;26.<ref name=\"TCR\"/>\n\nOn October&nbsp;18, the Mexican government issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] for the east coastline of the [[Yucat\u00e1n peninsula]] from [[Punta Allen]] to [[Cabo Catoche]], including offshore islands. As the hurricane approached, these watches were upgraded to warnings and expanded from [[Chetumal]] near Belize to [[San Felipe Municipality, Yucat\u00e1n|San Felipe, Yucat\u00e1n]]; a tropical storm warning extended westward to [[Celest\u00fan]].

[[Hurricane Wilma]] first developed on October&nbsp;15 in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Four days later, it strengthened into the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record, as measured by [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]]. Wilma weakened as it moved slowly northwestward, eventually making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] late on October&nbsp;21 on the island of [[Cozumel]] as a Category&nbsp;4 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]]. Early the next day, the hurricane made another landfall on the Mexican mainland near [[Puerto Morelos]]. Wilma exited the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on October&nbsp23, and a day later struck [[Florida]].\n\nThe large and powerful hurricane dropped torrential rainfall across the northeastern Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and on nearby offshore islands. Over a 24&nbsp;hour period, Wilma dropped {{convert|1633.98|mm|in|abbr=on}} worth of rainfall, which was the great 24&nbsp;hour accumulation ever recorded in the [[western hemisphere]]. Wilma lashed parts of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula with hurricane-force winds for 50&nbsp;hours. The hurricane produced Mexico's strongest wind gust ever recorded, when an [[anemometer]] recorded a reading of 212&nbsp;km/h (132&nbsp;mph) before the instrument failed. Wind gusts were estimated as high as {{convert|230|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. The hurricane moved ashore with an estimated {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[storm surge]], along with {{convert|5|to|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} waves which reached the third story of some buildings. Wilma severely eroded the beaches of eastern Quintana Roo and also caused flooding in neighboring [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]] state.\n\nWilma contributed to eight deaths in Mexico \u2013 seven in Quintana Roo and one in Yucat\u00e1n. The direct impacts of Hurricane Wilma inflicted about $4.8&nbsp;billion ([[Mexican peso|MXN]], [[United States dollar|US$]]454&nbsp;million) worth of damage, mostly in Quintana Roo, where it was the state's costliest natural disaster. Much of the damage was to tourist areas of [[Canc\u00fan]] and other nearby resort areas. The hurricane's indirect costs were significantly higher due to its disruption of tourism revenue, estimated at $13.9&nbsp;billion (US$1.3&nbsp;billion). About 98% of the hotels and resorts in Quintana Roo were damaged, including 110&nbsp;hotels damaged or destroyed in Canc\u00fan. Nationwide, Wilma destroyed 4,571&nbsp;houses and caused damage to 28,980&nbsp;other homes. In Canc\u00fan alone, the hurricane left 300,000&nbsp;people homeless. \n\n==Background and preparations==\n[[File:Wilma in cozumel island-109920 m.jpg|right|thumb|The [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] of Hurricane Wilma moving over [[Cozumel]]]]\n[[Hurricane Wilma]] developed on October&nbsp;15, 2005 in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Four days later, it strengthened into a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Saffir-Simpson scale]], with the lowest recorded [[atmospheric pressure|barometric pressure]] of any Atlantic hurricane; the [[Hurricane Hunters]] recorded a minimum pressure of {{convert|882|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}. Wilma weakened as it drifted northwestward through the Caribbean over the next two days.<ref name=\"TCR\"/> Originally, the hurricane was projected to move through the [[Yucat\u00e1n Channel]] between Mexico and Cuba, but it maintained its northwest trajectory.<ref name=\"mexdam\"/> Wilma made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] late on October&nbsp;21 on the island of [[Cozumel]]; the NHC estimated the landfall intensity at {{Convert|927|mbar|inHg|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}, with [[maximum sustained winds]] of 150&nbsp;mph (240&nbsp;km/h), making it a [[List of Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes|Category&nbsp;4]]. Early on October&nbsp;22, Wilma made a second landfall on the [[Quintana Roo]] mainland near [[Puerto Morelos]]. It then drifted across the northeastern Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, emerging into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on October&nbsp;23. The hurricane later moved to the northeast, striking [[Florida]] on October&nbsp;24. It accelerated northeastward across the Atlantic Ocean, becoming an [[extratropical cyclone]] on October&nbsp;26.<ref name=\"TCR\"/>\n\nOn October&nbsp;18, the Mexican government issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] for the east coastline of the [[Yucat\u00e1n peninsula]] from [[Punta Allen]] to [[Cabo Catoche]], including offshore islands. As the hurricane approached, these watches were upgraded to warnings and expanded from [[Chetumal]] near Belize to [[San Felipe Municipality, Yucat\u00e1n|San Felipe, Yucat\u00e1n]]; a tropical storm warning extended westward to [[Celest\u00fan]].
