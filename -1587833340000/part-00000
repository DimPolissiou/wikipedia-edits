Sumner'' class''' was a group of 58 [[destroyer]]s built by the United States during [[World War II]]. Another twelve ships were completed as [[destroyer minelayer]]s. Often referred to as simply the ''Sumner'', this class was characterized by their twin [[5\"/38 caliber gun|5-inch/38 caliber]] gun mounts, dual rudders, additional [[anti-aircraft]] weapons, and many other advancements over the previous {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer|4}}. The ''Allen M. Sumner'' design was extended {{convert|14|ft|m}} amidships to become the {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer|4}}, which was produced in larger numbers.\n\nCompleted in 1943\u201345, four were lost in the war and two were damaged so badly they were scrapped, but the surviving ships served in the US Navy into the 1970s. After being retired from the US fleet, 29 of them were sold to other navies, where they served many more years. One still exists as a [[museum ship]] in South Carolina.\n\n==Description==\nThe first ship was laid down in May 1943, while the last was launched in April 1945. In that time the United States produced 58 ''Allen M. Sumner''-class destroyers.  The ''Allen M. Sumner'' class was an improvement of the previous {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer|4}}, which were built from 1941 until 1944. In addition to three twin [[5\"/38 caliber gun|5-inch/38 caliber]] gun mounts replacing the ''Fletcher''s' five single mounts, ''Sumner''s had twin rudders, giving them better maneuverability for [[Antisubmarine warfare|ASW]] work when compared to ''Fletcher''s. The 5-inch guns were guided by a [[Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System]] with a Mark 25 [[fire-control radar|fire control radar]] linked by a [[Mark I Fire Control Computer|Mark 1A Fire Control Computer]] stabilized by a Mark 6 8,500 rpm gyro. This [[ship gun fire-control system|fire control system]] provided effective long-range anti-aircraft (AA) or anti-surface fire.  The ''Allen M. Sumner''s also had much more short-range anti-aircraft armament than the ''Fletcher''s, with 12 [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40 mm gun]]s and 11 [[20 mm gun]]s compared with 10 40 mm and 7 20 mm for a typical late-war upgraded ''Fletcher''. The initial design retained the ''Fletcher''s' heavy [[torpedo]] armament of 10 {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} tubes in two quintuple mounts, firing the [[Mark 15 torpedo]]. As the threat from ''[[kamikaze]]'' aircraft mounted in 1945, and with few remaining [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese warships]] to use torpedoes on, most of the class had the aft quintuple 21-inch torpedo tube mount replaced by an additional 40 mm quadruple mount for 16 total 40 mm guns.<ref name=\"DestroyerOnline\">.\"[http://www.destroyersonline.com/usndd/sumnrasbuilt.htm The ''Sumner'' Class As Built] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222014830/http://www.destroyersonline.com/usndd/sumnrasbuilt.htm |date=22 February 2012 }}.

Sumner''s achieved a 20% increase in 5-inch gun armament and almost a 50% increase in light AA armament on a hull the same length as a ''Fletcher'', only {{convert|15|in|cm}} wider, and about 15 inches (38 cm) deeper in draft. The increase in standard displacement was only 150 tons, about 7.5%. Thus, the ''Allen M. Sumner'' class was a significant improvement in combat power at a small increase in cost.\n\nSee also {{sclass-|Robert H. Smith|destroyer|0}} [[destroyer minelayer]] (DM), twelve of which were built on hulls originally intended as ''Allen M. Sumner''s. {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer|2}}s were of the same design, modified with a {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=on}} midship extension to carry more fuel to extend the ships' range.\n\n==Construction==\nEighteen were built by [[Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company]] in [[Kearny, New Jersey]]. Fourteen were built by [[Bath Iron Works]] in [[Bath, Maine]]. Ten were built by [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation|Bethlehem Steel]]'s Mariners Harbor shipyard on [[Staten Island]]. Six were built by [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation|Bethlehem Steel]]'s [[Union Iron Works]] in San Francisco. Five were built by [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation|Bethlehem Steel]] in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro, California]]. Five were built by [[Todd Pacific Shipyards]] in [[Seattle]], Washington.<!--DANFS lists Robert K. Huntington (DD-781) as built by [[Seattle-Tacoma Ship Building Corporation]], but she was built at the Todd facility on Harbor island with the other four Todd ships, not the Tacoma yard which appears to have been owned by Todd at the time.--> {{USS|Barton|DD-722|6}} was the first ship of the class to be laid down and the first to be commissioned. {{USS|Henley|DD-762|6}} was the last commissioned.\n\n==Service==\nThe ''Allen M. Sumner''s served on [[radar picket]] stations in the [[Battle of Okinawa]], as well as other duties, and had several losses. ''Cooper'', ''Meredith'', ''Mannert L. Abele'', and ''Drexler'' were lost during the war, and ''Hugh W. Hadley'' was so badly damaged by a kamikaze attack that she was scrapped soon after the war ended. In addition, ''Frank E. Evans'' was split in half in a collision with the aircraft carrier HMAS ''Melbourne'', and never repaired. After the war most of the class (except some of the light minelayers) had their 40&nbsp;mm and 20&nbsp;mm guns replaced by up to six [[3\"/50 caliber gun|3-inch/50 caliber guns]] (76&nbsp;mm), and the pole mast was replaced by a tripod to carry a new, heavier radar. On most ships one depth charge rack was removed and two [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] mounts added. One of the two quintuple {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]] mountings had already been removed on most to make way for a quadruple 40&nbsp;mm gun mounting and additional radar for the radar picket mission. 33 ships were converted under the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization II ([[FRAM II]]) program 1960\u201365, but not as extensively as the ''Gearing''s. Typically, FRAM ''Allen M. Sumner''s retained all three 5-inch/38 twin mounts and received the [[QH-50 DASH|Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter]] (DASH), two triple [[Mark 32 torpedo tubes]] for the [[Mark 44 torpedo]], and two new single 21-inch torpedo tubes for the [[Mark 37 torpedo]], with all 3-inch and lighter guns, previous ASW armament, and 21-inch torpedo tubes being removed. [[Variable Depth Sonar#Anti-submarine warfare|Variable Depth Sonar]] (VDS) was also fitted; however, [[ASROC]] was not fitted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/05/helpers/fram.htm|title=Special Feature - FRAM|website=www.navsource.org}}</ref> Ships that did not receive FRAM were typically upgraded with [[Mark 32 Surface Vessel Torpedo Tubes|Mk 32]] triple torpedo tubes in exchange for the K-guns, but retained Hedgehog and one depth charge rack.<ref name=\"Friedman 2004\"/>\n\nIn Navy slang, the modified destroyers were called \"FRAM cans\", \"can\" being a contraction of \"tin can\", the slang term for a destroyer or destroyer escort.\n\nMany ''Allen M. Sumner''s provided significant [[gunfire support]] in the [[Vietnam War]]. They also served as escorts for Carrier Battle Groups (Carrier Strike Groups from 2004) and Amphibious Ready Groups (Expeditionary Strike Groups from 2006). From 1965, some of the class were transferred to the [[Naval Reserve Force]] (NRF), with a partial active crew to train Naval reservists.\n\n==Disposition==\n[[File:USS De Haven (DD-727).jpg|thumb|left|{{USS|De Haven|DD-727|6}} c.1970 fitted with FRAM II modifications.]]\nThe ships served in the US Navy into the 1970s. DASH was withdrawn from [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) service in 1969 due to poor reliability.<ref>Friedman, p. 283</ref> Lacking [[ASROC]], the ''Allen M. Sumner''s were left without a standoff ASW capability, and were decommissioned 1970\u201373, with most being transferred to foreign navies. The FRAM Sumners were effectively replaced as ASW ships by the {{sclass-|Knox|frigate|1}}s (destroyer escorts prior to 1975), which were commissioned 1969\u201374 and carried a piloted helicopter, typically the [[Kaman SH-2 Seasprite]], and ASROC. After the ''Allen M. Sumner''s were retired from the US fleet, seven were sunk by the US in fleet training exercises and 13 were scrapped, while 29 were sold to other navies (two for spare parts), where they served for many more years. 12 were sold to the [[Republic of China Navy]] and 2 were sold to the [[Republic of Korea Navy]]. 2 were sold to the [[Iran]] and 1 was sold to [[Turkey]]. 1 was sold to [[Greece]]. 2 were sold to [[Venezuela]], 2 to [[Colombia]], 2 sold to [[Chile]], 5 sold to [[Brazil]] and 4 to [[Argentina]].\n\nCurrently, only {{USS|Laffey|DD-724}} located at [[Patriots Point]], [[Charleston, South Carolina]] remains as a museum ship.\n\n=== Argentina ===\nThe [[Argentine Navy]] acquired four ''Sumners'' as a more capable adjunct to their previously acquired ''Fletcher'' class destroyers.  While one was merely to provide spare parts to keep the rest of the fleet serviceable, the other three would go on and serve through the [[Falklands War]], in which they would take a minor role.  Soon after the conflict, they were stricken and disposed of.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Pennant !! Ship name !! Former name !! Acquired !! Fate\n|-\n!

Sumner'' class''' was a group of 58 [[destroyer]]s built by the United States during [[World War II]]. Another twelve ships were completed as [[destroyer minelayer]]s. Often referred to as simply the ''Sumner', this class was characterized by their twin [[5\"/38 caliber gun|5-inch/38 caliber]] gun mounts, dual rudders, additional [[anti-aircraft]] weapons, and many other advancements over the previous {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer|4}}. The ''Allen M. Sumner'' design was extended {{convert|14|ft|m}} amidships to become the {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer|4}}, which was produced in larger numbers.\n\nCompleted in 1943\u201345, four were lost in the war and two were damaged so badly they were scrapped, but the surviving ships served in the US Navy into the 1970s. After being retired from the US fleet, 29 of them were sold to other navies, where they served many more years. One still exists as a [[museum ship]] in South Carolina.\n\n==Description==\nThe first ship was laid down in May 1943, while the last was launched in April 1945. In that time the United States produced 58 ''Allen M. Sumner''-class destroyers.  The ''Allen M. Sumner'' class was an improvement of the previous {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer|4}}, which were built from 1941 until 1944. In addition to three twin [[5\"/38 caliber gun|5-inch/38 caliber]] gun mounts replacing the ''Fletcher''s' five single mounts, ''Sumner''s had twin rudders, giving them better maneuverability for [[Antisubmarine warfare|ASW]] work when compared to ''Fletcher''s. The 5-inch guns were guided by a [[Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System]] with a Mark 25 [[fire-control radar|fire control radar]] linked by a [[Mark I Fire Control Computer|Mark 1A Fire Control Computer]] stabilized by a Mark 6 8,500 rpm gyro. This [[ship gun fire-control system|fire control system]] provided effective long-range anti-aircraft (AA) or anti-surface fire.  The ''Allen M. Sumner''s also had much more short-range anti-aircraft armament than the ''Fletcher''s, with 12 [[Bofors 40 mm gun|40 mm gun]]s and 11 [[20 mm gun]]s compared with 10 40 mm and 7 20 mm for a typical late-war upgraded ''Fletcher''. The initial design retained the ''Fletcher''s' heavy [[torpedo]] armament of 10 {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} tubes in two quintuple mounts, firing the [[Mark 15 torpedo]]. As the threat from ''[[kamikaze]]'' aircraft mounted in 1945, and with few remaining [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese warships]] to use torpedoes on, most of the class had the aft quintuple 21-inch torpedo tube mount replaced by an additional 40 mm quadruple mount for 16 total 40 mm guns.<ref name=\"DestroyerOnline\">.\"[http://www.destroyersonline.com/usndd/sumnrasbuilt.htm The ''Sumner'' Class As Built] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222014830/http://www.destroyersonline.com/usndd/sumnrasbuilt.htm |date=22 February 2012 }}.

Sumner''s achieved a 20% increase in 5-inch gun armament and almost a 50% increase in light AA armament on a hull the same length as a ''Fletcher'', only {{convert|15|in|cm}} wider, and about 15 inches (38 cm) deeper in draft. The increase in standard displacement was only 150 tons, about 7.5%. Thus, the ''Allen M. Sumner'' class was a significant improvement in combat power at a small increase in cost.\n\nSee also {{sclass-|Robert H. Smith|destroyer|0}} [[destroyer minelayer]] (DM), twelve of which were built on hulls originally intended as ''Allen M. Sumner''s. {{sclass-|Gearing|destroyer|2}}s were of the same design, modified with a {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=on}} midship extension to carry more fuel to extend the ships' range.\n\n==Construction==\nEighteen were built by [[Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company]] in [[Kearny, New Jersey]]. Fourteen were built by [[Bath Iron Works]] in [[Bath, Maine]]. Ten were built by [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation|Bethlehem Steel]]'s Mariners Harbor shipyard on [[Staten Island]]. Six were built by [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation|Bethlehem Steel]]'s [[Union Iron Works]] in San Francisco. Five were built by [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation|Bethlehem Steel]] in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro, California]]. Five were built by [[Todd Pacific Shipyards]] in [[Seattle]], Washington.<!--DANFS lists Robert K. Huntington (DD-781) as built by [[Seattle-Tacoma Ship Building Corporation]], but she was built at the Todd facility on Harbor island with the other four Todd ships, not the Tacoma yard which appears to have been owned by Todd at the time.--> {{USS|Barton|DD-722|6}} was the first ship of the class to be laid down and the first to be commissioned. {{USS|Henley|DD-762|6}} was the last commissioned.\n\n==Service==\nThe ''Allen M. Sumner''s served on [[radar picket]] stations in the [[Battle of Okinawa]], as well as other duties, and had several losses. ''Cooper'', ''Meredith'', ''Mannert L. Abele'', and ''Drexler'' were lost during the war, and ''Hugh W. Hadley'' was so badly damaged by a kamikaze attack that she was scrapped soon after the war ended. In addition, ''Frank E. Evans'' was split in half in a collision with the aircraft carrier HMAS ''Melbourne'', and never repaired. After the war most of the class (except some of the light minelayers) had their 40&nbsp;mm and 20&nbsp;mm guns replaced by up to six [[3\"/50 caliber gun|3-inch/50 caliber guns]] (76&nbsp;mm), and the pole mast was replaced by a tripod to carry a new, heavier radar. On most ships one depth charge rack was removed and two [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] mounts added. One of the two quintuple {{convert|21|in|mm|adj=on|0}} [[torpedo tube]] mountings had already been removed on most to make way for a quadruple 40&nbsp;mm gun mounting and additional radar for the radar picket mission. 33 ships were converted under the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization II ([[FRAM II]]) program 1960\u201365, but not as extensively as the ''Gearing''s. Typically, FRAM ''Allen M. Sumner''s retained all three 5-inch/38 twin mounts and received the [[QH-50 DASH|Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter]] (DASH), two triple [[Mark 32 torpedo tubes]] for the [[Mark 44 torpedo]], and two new single 21-inch torpedo tubes for the [[Mark 37 torpedo]], with all 3-inch and lighter guns, previous ASW armament, and 21-inch torpedo tubes being removed. [[Variable Depth Sonar#Anti-submarine warfare|Variable Depth Sonar]] (VDS) was also fitted; however, [[ASROC]] was not fitted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navsource.org/archives/05/helpers/fram.htm|title=Special Feature - FRAM|website=www.navsource.org}}</ref> Ships that did not receive FRAM were typically upgraded with [[Mark 32 Surface Vessel Torpedo Tubes|Mk 32]] triple torpedo tubes in exchange for the K-guns, but retained Hedgehog and one depth charge rack.<ref name=\"Friedman 2004\"/>\n\nIn Navy slang, the modified destroyers were called \"FRAM cans\", \"can\" being a contraction of \"tin can\", the slang term for a destroyer or destroyer escort.\n\nMany ''Allen M. Sumner''s provided significant [[gunfire support]] in the [[Vietnam War]]. They also served as escorts for Carrier Battle Groups (Carrier Strike Groups from 2004) and Amphibious Ready Groups (Expeditionary Strike Groups from 2006). From 1965, some of the class were transferred to the [[Naval Reserve Force]] (NRF), with a partial active crew to train Naval reservists.\n\n==Disposition==\n[[File:USS De Haven (DD-727).jpg|thumb|left|{{USS|De Haven|DD-727|6}} c.1970 fitted with FRAM II modifications.]]\nThe ships served in the US Navy into the 1970s. DASH was withdrawn from [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) service in 1969 due to poor reliability.<ref>Friedman, p. 283</ref> Lacking [[ASROC]], the ''Allen M. Sumner''s were left without a standoff ASW capability, and were decommissioned 1970\u201373, with most being transferred to foreign navies. The FRAM Sumners were effectively replaced as ASW ships by the {{sclass-|Knox|frigate|1}}s (destroyer escorts prior to 1975), which were commissioned 1969\u201374 and carried a piloted helicopter, typically the [[Kaman SH-2 Seasprite]], and ASROC. After the ''Allen M. Sumner''s were retired from the US fleet, seven were sunk by the US in fleet training exercises and 13 were scrapped, while 29 were sold to other navies (two for spare parts), where they served for many more years. 12 were sold to the [[Republic of China Navy]] and 2 were sold to the [[Republic of Korea Navy]]. 2 were sold to the [[Iran]] and 1 was sold to [[Turkey]]. 1 was sold to [[Greece]]. 2 were sold to [[Venezuela]], 2 to [[Colombia]], 2 sold to [[Chile]], 5 sold to [[Brazil]] and 4 to [[Argentina]].\n\nCurrently, only {{USS|Laffey|DD-724}} located at [[Patriots Point]], [[Charleston, South Carolina]] remains as a museum ship.\n\n=== Argentina ===\nThe [[Argentine Navy]] acquired four ''Sumners'' as a more capable adjunct to their previously acquired ''Fletcher'' class destroyers.  While one was merely to provide spare parts to keep the rest of the fleet serviceable, the other three would go on and serve through the [[Falklands War]], in which they would take a minor role.  Soon after the conflict, they were stricken and disposed of.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Pennant !! Ship name !! Former name !! Acquired !! Fate\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Babla & Kanchan", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n'''Laxmichand \"Babla\" Virji Shah''' and '''Kumari Kanchan Dinkerrao Mail Shah''' were an Indian husband-wife musical group best known for work in the [[chutney music]] and [[Desi]] Folk music genres. They performed together for forty years until Kanchan died in 2004. Babla Shah is the younger brother of famous music director duo [[Kalyanji Anandji]].<ref>https://scroll.in/reel/851569/for-disco-dandiya-pioneer-babla-it-has-always-been-about-the-beat</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBabla was born as Laxmichand Shah, son of Virji Shah, into a [[Kutchi people|Kutchi]] [[Hindu]] family of trading background. His family hailed from the village of [[Kundrodi]] in [[Kutch]], [[Gujarat]]. His father had moved to Mumbai and set up a shop in [[Girgaum]]. The music director duo of [[Kalyanji-Anandji|Kalyanji and Anandji]] are Babla's elder brothers. \n\nBabla sang some songs for films and also tried his hand at music direction like his older brothers. According to film music expert Rajesh Subramanian, the song \"Khaike Pan Banaraswala\" was composed by Babla. He felt the need to differentiate himself from his famous brothers and he took up folk music-with-western-elements as his niche genre of music. He made this selection because he had a taste and talent for this type of hybrid music, as also a liking for live performance. He started his band in 1962, and the venture met with success. A form of traditional folk dance from the state of [[Gujarat]] called ''Dandiya Raas'' or ''Raas Garba'' was musically redefined (with western elements and instruments) by Shah in the 1970s. In 2011, Shah was awarded the Radio Mirchi Music Award for Outstanding Contribution to Hindi Film Music. Unfortunately, Kanchan was not there to cherish the moment. She had passed away in 2004. Today, Shah is a drummer, percussionist, live performing artist, [[composer]] and record producer. \n\nKanchan was born into a family of [[Marathi people|Marathi]] background, the daughter of Dinakar Rao Mail (Mali?). She was a talented singer and her songs are there in the films [[Rafoo Chakkar]], [[Dharmatma]] and [[Qurbani (film)|Qurbani]], all of whose music was scored by [[Kalyanji-Anandji]]. Kanchan's songs in these films included ''Kya Khoob Lagti Ho -- Phir Se kaho'' and ''Laila Oh Laila,'' which remain popular even today. Yet she did not get adequate recognition, despite the support of Babla's older brothers, and the reason was again (as with Babla) the need to differentiate her voice and style from that of other established singers. Perhaps for this reason, her career as a playback singer for Hindi films was rather limited. She distinguished herself by moving to [[Bhojpuri language]], a regional dialect of [[Hindi]], and found greater success there. Her solo albums like ''Kaise Bani'' were popular with [[Bhojpuri]] audience. Her popularity even led to product endorsement deals for various consumer brands including [[Johnson & Johnson]]. She had meanwhile become close to Kalanji-Anandji and their family. She married Babla and joined her husband's troupe or band. \n\nThe husband-wife duo performed and toured around the globe together. Their international engagements then kept them away from Hindi (Bollywood) film music, which they gradually abandoned. The decade of the 1980s was their heyday for live performances. They were mostly popular in [[Caribbean]] countries, where they covered [[soca music|soca]] hits like ''[[Hot Hot Hot (Arrow song)|Hot Hot Hot]].'' They also revived older hits by their chutney music predecessor singer [[Sundar Popo]]. Due to their extensive touring support, their LP albums including ''Kuch Gadbad Hai'' sold well for an Indian group traveling abroad. The dance music for these sensual folk dances came to be termed [[Chutney (music)|chutney music]] and is now recognized as a genre in itself.\n\n==Songs==\nMany songs Kanchan sang were remakes of older songs by West Indian locals, or were [[Soca music|soca]] classics or by [[Sundar Popo]] from Trinidad.\n*\"Kaise Bani\" (originally by [[Sundar Popo]])\n*\"Chaadar Bechaow\" (originally by [[Sundar Popo]])\n*\"Benji Darling\" (originally by Neisha Benjamin)\n*\"Ai Ai O\" (\"Buss Up Shot\" by Baron)\n*\"Kuch Garbar\" Hai (\"Hot Hot Hot\" by Arrow)\n*\"Tiny Winy\" (\"Tiny Winey\" by Byron Lee & The Dragonaires)\n*\"Kuch Kuch Baby\" (\"Rock It\" by Merchant)\n*\"Hum Na Jaibe\" (originally by [[Sundar Popo]])\n*\"Na Manu\" (originally by Bidjanwatie Chaitoe, Diamond Collection)\n*\"Leggo Me Na Raja\" (originally by Halima Bissoon)\n\n==Family==\nThe couple has two children, daughter Nisha and son Vaibhav.

As one of the principal military survey units in Australia, the role of the Royal Australian Survey Corps was to provide the maps, aeronautical charts, hydrographical charts and [[Geodesy|geodetic]] and control survey data required for land combat operations. \n\nFunctional responsibilities associated with this role were: theatre wide geodetic survey for \u2013 artillery, naval gunfire and close air support \u2013 mapping and charting \u2013 navigation systems \u2013 command and control, communications, intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance systems; map production and printing for new maps and charts, plans, overprints, battle maps, air photo mosaics and photomaps, rapid map and chart revision; map holding and map distribution; production, maintenance and distribution of digital topographic information and products. RA Svy survey and mapping information was, and still is, a key information source for [[geospatial intelligence]].\n\nThe operational doctrine was that the combat force deployed into the area of operations with topographic products adequate for planning, force insertion and initial conduct of tactical operations, that new products and broad area updates of the topographic base would be provided by the support area and communication zone survey forces, and that the combat support survey force in the area of operations would update the topographic base, add tactical operational and intelligence information and provide the value-added products required by the combat force.<ref name=cc2000>Coulthard-Clark, CD, 2000, ''Australia's Military Mapmakers \u2013 The Royal Australian Survey Corps 1915\u201396'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-551343-6}}</ref>\n\nThe Historical Collection of the Survey Corps is maintained by the Australian Army Museum of Military Engineering at Holsworthy Barracks, south-west Sydney, New South Wales. Survey Corps Associations of ex-members, family and friends are located in Adelaide, Bendigo, Brisbane, Canberra, Perth and Sydney. Many wartime maps produced by the Survey Corps are in the [[Australian War Memorial]] collection, while all of the maps produced by the Corps are also in the national collection at the [[National Library of Australia]]. All of these are available to the public and some are on-line.\n\n==History==\n{{Australian Army Arms}}\n\n===Origins===\nAustralia's first surveyor, Lieutenant August Alt, was an Army officer of the [[8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot]], which arrived in Australia with the [[First Fleet]] in January 1788.<ref name=reilly1983>Reilly, SE, ''Soldiers and Surveyors'', 1983; The Australian Surveyor, March 1983, Vol 31, No 5, p 315</ref> Eighteen years before him, [[James Cook|Lieutenant James Cook]], Royal Navy, used his knowledge and skills of topographic survey by plane-table for his surveys and charting of the east coast. \n\nThe graphical method of topographic survey, first used before 1600, was the mainstay of the Australian Survey Corps for the first 20 years and used in the two world wars and occasionally much later. Cook had learned surveying in Canada from Royal Engineer Samuel Holland who then (1758) was the first Surveyor-General of British North America.<ref>Mundle, Rob ''Cook From Sailor to Legend'' Harper Collins Publishers, 2013</ref>\n\nFor 113 years of colonisation after the arrival of the First Fleet, much of the mapping of Australia, mainly for exploration, settlement and development, was supervised and conducted by naval and military officers. These officers included the well known explorers and surveyors: Captain [[Matthew Flinders]], Royal Navy; Lieutenant [[William Dawes (Royal Marines officer)]], (New South Wales); Lieutenant [[Philip Parker King]], Royal Navy (mainly Tasmania, Western Australia and Northern Territory), Lieutenant [[John Oxley]], Royal Navy, (New South Wales); Lieutenant Colonel Sir [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] (New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland); Captain [[Charles Sturt]] (New South Wales and South Australia); Lieutenant [[John Septimus Roe]], Royal Navy (Western Australia), and Colonel [[William Light]] (South Australia). \n\nAfter 100 years of settlement some topographic maps had been produced for both public and private use but only a few maps were of any real military utility. The colonial part-time Defence Forces prepared small-area training manoeuvre maps and some colonies had produced small systematic topographic surveys for defence of the main ports of trade and commerce in the 1880s and 1890s. That is not to say that the need for topographic mapping was not a government and public concern but there were only minor attempts to allocate appropriate public resources.<ref name=\"lines\">Lines, John D ''Australia on Paper \u2013 The Story of Australian Mapping'', Fortune Publications, 1992, {{ISBN|0 646 09769 5}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901, the Defence Act 1903 made provision for military survey but nothing was immediately done to address the matter. Most recently a royal commission into the way the British Army had conducted itself in South Africa (Boer War) found that the troops had to fight without adequate topographic information. Indeed, accurate maps of the Boer republics did not exist. The Times' history of the Boer War 1899\u20131902 included: 'The chief deduction to be made in the matter is that no efforts during a war will compensate for the lack of a proper topographical survey made in peace time. Maps are a necessity to a modern army, and the expense of making them is very small compared with the cost of a campaign.' <ref>Amery, ''The Times History of the War in South Africa 1899\u20131902'', vol 6, p350</ref>\n\nIn early 1907, Colonel [[William Bridges (general)|William Bridges]] then Chief of Intelligence and the senior Australian military officer recommended to Defence Minister Sir [[Thomas Ewing (Australian politician)|Thomas Ewing]], member for [[Richmond, New South Wales]], that a Chief of the General Staff should be appointed in place of Chief of Intelligence and that a General Staff be established.  The Minister, who was a licensed surveyor, was unimpressed by the advice preferring to continue for the time being with the arrangements of a Military Board.  He was concerned that there were no plans for mobilization, or local defence, noting that \"there were few reliable maps, even of the most important localities\".  \n\nThese were the important national defence issues that Ewing recommended to Bridges for his immediate attention.<ref name=\"mordike1992\">Mordike, J, ''An Army for a Nation'', 1992, Allen and Unwin, p 193</ref> The [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] and the Government considered a number of options to address the important and urgent need for a military survey, finally deciding in late 1907 to raise the [[Australian Army Intelligence Corps|Australian Intelligence Corps]] (AIC) manned by part-time [[Citizen Military Force]] (CMF) officers who were trained in surveying or draughting and whose duties included the preparation of strategic and tactical maps and plans. In Victoria the military survey was the responsibility of Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Monash]] who was then the senior AIC militia officer in the 3rd Military District.<ref name=\"cc2000\" /> \n\nBy 1909 the limitations of this arrangement were evident, and after advice from a senior British Army Royal Engineer Survey Officer, it was decided to embark on a systematic military survey conducted full-time by a Survey Section, [[Royal Australian Engineers]] (RAE) (Permanent Forces), allotted for duty under the supervision of the AIC. The Section was to be commanded by an Australian survey officer and staffed by Australian warrant officer draughtsmen and non-commissioned officers (NCO) topographers and four NCO topographers on an initial two-year loan from the British Army Royal Engineers.\n\nThe Royal Engineer topographers (Corporal Lynch, Lance-Corporals Barrett, Davies and Wilcox) arrived in Melbourne on 11 April 1910 and on 16 April 1910, draughtsman Warrant Officer John J Raisbeck was the first Australian appointed to the Survey Section and soon after he was joined by draughtsman Warrant Officer Class 1 George Constable. Raisbeck was a survey draughtsman from the Department of Mines, Bendigo, and a Second-Lieutenant in the CMF 9th Light Horse Regiment. \n\nHe relinquished his commission to enlist in the Permanent Military Forces. He was granted the Honorary rank Second-Lieutenant and was retired with the rank Lieutenant-Colonel 33 years later at age 63 years having served in France in World War I and in World War II. Fitzgerald said that JJ Raisbeck was the 'pioneer of military mapping in Australia'.<ref name=\"fitz1980\" />\n\nThe first officer appointed to the position Lieutenant Survey Section RAE (Permanent) was Lieutenant William Lawrence Whitham, a licensed surveyor from South Australia, having been highly recommended by the Surveyor-General South Australia. He assumed his appointment on 1 July 1910 at which time there were seven members of the Section. All men were professional surveyors and draftsman. CMF officers of the AIC in the Military District Headquarters supervised the work of the Section. In 1912 the Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia State Governments each agreed to loan a Lands Department Survey Officer to the Survey Section RAE for two years to supervise the work of the Section in each State. Each Survey Officer was a militia officer in the AIC. The Section was divided into two sub-sections and employed in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia producing scale one-mile-to-one-inch military maps ('one-mile' map) mainly of areas around cities and key infrastructure. \n\nBy mid-1913 the Section had completed topographic field sheets by plane-tabling for eight maps around Newcastle, Melbourne and Canberra. The initial method of using parish plans to position the topographic detail was soon found to be inadequate and a geodetic subsection was established in 1914 to provide surveys by geodetic triangulation as spatial frameworks for the field sheets produced by the topographers. The triangulation work started at Werribee south-west of Melbourne and proceeded west along the coast to Warrnambool. This work included the 1860 Geodetic Survey of Victoria where appropriate \u2013 much of which was produced by Royal Engineer officers. The AIC was disbanded in 1914 but the work of the Survey Section continued under the supervision and control of the Intelligence Section of the General Staff under the general direction of the Chief of the General Staff (CGS).<ref name=\"cc2000\" /><ref name=\"sargent1990\">Sargent, Clem, Lieutenant-Colonel RA Svy, 1990, ''The Royal Australian Survey Corps 1915\u20131990''</ref><ref name=\"bulletin\">Royal Australian Survey Corps Association Bulletin 1965 to 1989</ref><ref name=\"sms1985\">School of Military Survey,1985, ''The Chronology of RA Svy Corps'', Edition 2</ref>\n\n===First World War===\nThe outbreak of the First World War on 4 August 1914 did not, at first, seriously affect the work of the members of the Section as the highest priority and urgent work of the Permanent Forces was military survey for defence of the major cities and ports in Australia. Indeed, the Section gained an increase in personnel and equipment.<ref name=quinlan1943>Quinlan, Cecil Verdon, Major, Survey Section RAE 1913\u201315, ''Australian Map Makers'', The Australian Surveyor, Sept 1, 1943</ref> At that stage it was understood that the British Army would provide the maps required for the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) war fighting. However, by 17 August the Draughting sub-Section of the Survey Section RAE in Melbourne had prepared a map of the north-east frontier of France for reproduction of 1,000 copies by photo-lithography by the Victorian Lands Department for issue to the Australian Imperial Force.<ref>Chief of the General Staff War Diary 17 August 1914 \u2013 Letter to Secretary of the Department of Lands, Victoria</ref>\n\nOn 3 July 1915, Military Order 396 of 1915 promulgated that His Excellency the Governor-General has been pleased to approve of: 'A Corps to be called the Australian Survey Corps being raised as a unit of the Permanent Military Forces. All officers, warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men now serving in the Survey Section of the Royal Australian Engineers being transferred to the Australian Survey Corps with their present ranks and seniority.'<ref name=cc2000 /> The effective date of the foundation of the Corps was 1 July 1915 \u2013 on that day there were two officers and seventeen warrant officers and NCOs of the Corps (at that stage there were no sappers in the Corps). The Australian Survey Corps was placed fourth in the Order of Precedence of Corps after the Royal Australian Engineers.\n\nRaising the Australian Survey Corps had nothing to do with supporting the AIF then at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], but provided for the key tasks of military survey of the high defence priority areas of Australia without direction or control of Intelligence Staff or the Royal Australian Engineers. The first Officer Commanding Australian Survey Corps was Honorary Captain Cecil Verdon Quinlan who had been appointed Lieutenant Survey Section RAE in March 1913 after Lieutenant Whitham resigned. Quinlan later gave credit to the creation of the Australian Survey Corps to the then General Staff Director of Military Operations \u2013 Major [[Brudenell White]] (later General Sir, Chief of the General Staff).<ref name=quinlan1943 />\n\nSurvey Corps members started to enlist in the AIF in November 1915, with three Warrant Officer draughtsmen (Murray, Shiels and MacDonald) working with the Headquarters of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] by late 1916. Then in late 1917, General Headquarters in France/Belgium requested survey personnel for topographic surveys in that theatre and a volunteer Australian Survey Corps AIF draft of four officers and seven NCOs arrived in France early in 1918. Military Survey in Australia then came to a virtual standstill when the AIF members departed for the Middle East and the Western Front. 2nd Lieutenant Raisbeck, Sergeants Anderson and Clements and Corporal Watson served with the Australian Corps Topographic Section in France/Belgium and Lieutenants Vance and Lynch, 2nd Lieutenant Davies, Sergeants Clews and Rossiter and Corporals Blaikie and Roberts served with General Headquarters Royal Engineer Survey Companies employed amongst other things on evaluating the suitability of the French triangulation networks for the purposes of military survey and mapping.\n\nIn late 1916, Warrant Officer Class 1 Hector E McMurtrie was enlisted into the Corps as a draughtsman for duty with the survey staff (not Australian Survey Corps) working on land title surveys for the military administration by the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force in the New Guinea area. In 1919 he died from a service related illness, and is commemorated on the [[Australian War Memorial]] Roll of Honour.  He was the first Australian Survey Corps member to die in war.\n\nIn early 1918 fourteen Corps members were serving with the AIF and eight were in Australia working on the military survey. One Survey Corps member (Warrant Officer Class 1 Alan Stewart Murray) and one Topographic Section Topographer Corporal Stafford were awarded the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]] for mapping under enemy fire, Topographic Section Topographer Sergeant Finlason was recommended for a Military Medal but was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1914\u20131918 (France)|French Croix De Guerre]], Topographic Section Draughtsman Sergeant Wightman was awarded the [[Meritorious Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Meritorious Service Medal]]. the Officer Commanding the 1st ANZAC Topographic Section in 1917 and the Australian Corps Topographic Section in 1918 Lieutenant Buchanan was awarded the [[Croix de guerre (Belgium)|Belgian Croix De Guerre]] and Topographic Section Lithographer Sergeant Dunstan was awarded the French Croix De Guerre. Warrant Officer Murray's citation for his work in [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Sinai and Palestine]] read \"for conspicuous gallantry and dedication to duty. For a prolonged period this Warrant Officer was engaged on surveying the area between the lines repeatedly working under machine gun fire and sniping. In order not to attract attention he usually worked alone with his plane table and instruments. Owing to his energy and coolness he has mapped a piece of country accurately and his work has been most valuable.\"  In March 1919 Warrant Officer Class 1 Norman Lyndhurst Shiels was mentioned in the despatches of the General Officer Commanding Egyptian Expeditionary Force, possibly for his work with the Royal Air Force in mapping from aerial photography.<ref name=cc2000 /><ref name=bulletin /><ref>National Archives of Australia, World War I personnel service records</ref>\n\n===Between the World Wars===\nWhen the AIF members returned to Australia in 1919 they were discharged and most were re-appointed to the Survey Section RAE (Permanent) or the Australian Survey Corps (Permanent). Military reorganisation after World War I, and the general reduction in military capability, saw the numbers reduced to fourteen all ranks. In 1920 the Corps was suspended and reverted, in title, to the Survey Section, RAE (Permanent). Mapping continued, mainly the 'one-mile' maps, albeit at a reduced rate consistent with the allocated resources, with priority given to areas around Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. By 1929 the Section had produced fifty-four 'one-mile' maps including five revised maps. \n\nTechnical developments provided for improved efficiencies. These included use of single photographs and strips of air photographs to supplement ground surveys by plane-table for topographic detail. The first military map produced with a significant component of aerial photography flown by the Royal Australian Air Force was the Albury 'one-mile' map published in 1933. Compilation of this map highlighted inconsistencies in State triangulation systems and once again demonstrated the need for a national geodetic survey which had been identified by colonial survey officers in the 1890s.\n\nIn 1932, the Army decided that the Order in Council which created the Corps in 1915 had never been broken and so the title of the military survey unit was once again the Australian Survey Corps (Permanent Forces) with the personnel establishment of fourteen all ranks as it had been for twelve years. Recruiting recommenced and in 1935 the Corps establishment was raised to twenty-five all ranks. Increments allowed for a Survey (Topographic) Section to be based in each of three states, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, a Survey (Geodetic) Section and the Survey (Draughting) Section in Melbourne. Then in 1938, with war clouds once again on the horizon, a three-year Long Range Mapping Programme was approved, with additional funding bringing the total to ninety-seven all ranks. These extra resources would provide for a total of about thirty-five new '1 mile' maps each year. \n\nHowever, at the outbreak of the Second World War there were only fifty members in the Australian Survey Corps. Most of the men were professionally qualified, and the Corps was very knowledgeable of emerging technical developments which would improve efficiencies in map production. That there were no militia units of the Corps was due mainly to the fact that little progress in the mapping programme was achieved with part-time effort. The Corps was well equipped for the range of field survey and office mapping tasks with the exception of printing presses. Maps were printed by the Victorian State Government Printer. At this stage, just before the Second World War, the total coverage of military 'one-mile' maps was eighty-one maps or about {{convert|36000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} or only about 40% of the identified military mapping requirement at that stage.<ref name=\"raisbeck1937\">Raisbeck, JJ Captain, Australian Survey Corps, ''A Short History of the Military Survey of Australia, 1907\u20131936'', The Australian Surveyor, Sept 1, 1937</ref><ref name=\"vance1940\">Vance, TA Major, ''Mapping a Continent'', The Australian Surveyor, Sept 2, 1940</ref>\n\nSections (all Permanent Forces) from the end of the First World War to pre-Second World War were:\n* Survey Section, RAE\n* No 1 Survey (Draughting) Section (Melbourne)\n* No 1 Survey (Topographic) Section (Queensland, South Australia and Victoria)\n* No 2 Survey (Topographic) Section (Victoria)\n* No 3 Survey (Topographic) Section (New South Wales)\n* No 4 Survey (Geodetic) Section (triangulation Southern Queensland \u2013 New South Wales \u2013 Victoria \u2013 South Australia)\n\n===Second World War===\n[[File:AWM 022643 2 1st Australian Corps Field Survey Coy Syria 1941.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from the Australian 2/1st Corps Field Survey Company, near the Turkish\u2013Syrian border, December 1941, mapping the topography using a plane-table.]]\nIn July 1939 'Instructions for War \u2013 Survey' were issued.<ref name=fitz1980 /> This outlined the military survey organisation required to undertake an Emergency Mapping Programme to complete the outstanding Long Range Mapping Programme and the nucleus for expansion to war establishment. The Emergency Mapping Programme was initially for strategic mapping at scale four-miles-to-one-inch ('four-mile maps') covering a coastal strip 200 miles (300&nbsp;km) inland from Townsville to Port Augusta and 100 miles (200&nbsp;km) inland from Albany to Geraldton and key strategic areas in Tasmania and around Darwin and 'one-mile' maps of populated places. Map production was from existing State Lands Departments information and conducted jointly between State and Commonwealth agencies and Survey Corps units. The programme expanded to include more of Australia, New Guinea, New Britain and New Ireland and although many maps were of a preliminary standard only, providing general coverage critical at the time.\n\nInitially, the Australian Survey Corps continued its mapping for the defence of Australia, proceeded with basic survey triangulation and provided training cadre for new field and training units. In January 1940, Field Survey Units RAE (Militia) were established in 1st Military District \u2013 Queensland, 2nd Military District \u2013 New South Wales and 3rd Military District \u2013 Victoria to accelerate the mapping effort. Deputy Assistant Directors \u2013 Survey were appointed to Military District Headquarters to advise on survey needs and to liaise with State agencies. In April 1940 the 2/1 Corps Field Survey Company RAE was raised as part of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force for service overseas and a Survey staff was appointed to the formation (Corps) headquarters. \n\nIn September 1940 significant expansion of the Australian Survey Corps was approved by Cabinet to include a Survey Directorate on Army Headquarters (AHQ) and higher formation headquarters, an AHQ Survey Company, an AHQ Cartographic Company, regional command field survey companies, a Survey Section 7th Military District (Darwin) and a Corps Survey Mobile Reproduction Section. Four militia Field Survey Companies were established in the regional commands (1 Field Survey Coy \u2013 Queensland, 2 Field Survey Coy \u2013 New South Wales, 3 Field Survey Coy \u2013 Victoria, 4 Field Survey Coy \u2013 Western Australia) absorbing the Australian Survey Corps Sections and the Field Survey Units RAE (M) in the Commands.\n\nIn early 1941, 2/1 Corps Field Survey Company RAE, sailed with the [[2nd Australian Imperial Force]], to provide survey and mapping to the Australian Corps in the Middle East theatre including Greece, Egypt, Cyrenaica and the border zones of Palestine, Syria, Trans-Jordan and Turkey. In response to the Japanese advance in the Pacific the 2/1 Corps Field Survey Company returned to Australia in early 1942 and over the next four years fifteen Australian Survey Corps units with various roles (including two Army level Topographical Survey Companies) provided survey and mapping support to military operations in the South West Pacific Area theatre of the war including Northern Territory, Papua, New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville, Dutch New Guinea, Borneo and the States of Australia in particular northern Australia. Women of the Australian Women's Army Service served in Survey units and formation headquarter sections in Australia and in New Guinea.<ref name=fitz1980 /><ref name=cc2000 />\n\nAcknowledgement of the value of survey support organic to the combat forces increased as the war progressed, with Survey Sections of 5th Field Survey Company assigned to both 7th Australian Infantry Division and 9th Australian Infantry Division for the large scale amphibious landings at Labuan and Balikpapan in Borneo. Later, the General Staff of Headquarters 1 Australian Corps said \"...never in this war have Australian troops been so well provided with accurate maps, sketches and photo reproductions...\" <ref name=fitz1980 />\n\nThe Corps produced more than 1440 new maps of the theatres of war (Middle East 28, Australian mainland 708, New Guinea area 364, Borneo 147, Mindanao Philippines 200), printing more than 3 million copies of the maps. The highly valued efforts of the Corps did not go unnoticed by senior commanders. Lieutenant-General [[Edmund Herring]], General Officer Commanding New Guinea Force, and Lieutenant-General [[John Northcott]], Chief of the General Staff, wrote letters of appreciation of the work of the Corps to the Director of Survey, Advanced Land Headquarters. General [[Douglas MacArthur]], Commander-in-Chief, South West Pacific Area wrote a letter of high commendation of Corps work to General [[Thomas Blamey]], Commander, Allied land Forces, South West Pacific Area. At Morotai, the Mobile Lithographic Section was given the privilege of preparing the Instrument of Surrender signed by Commander, Second Japanese Army and countersigned by General Blamey, Commander-in-Chief, Australian Military Forces. \n\nThe unit then printed thousands of copies of the surrender document for souvenirs. At the end of the war more than half of the Corps strength of 1700 were on active service outside Australia.<ref name=\"fitz1980\" /> Colonel Fitzgerald noted that 'One of the most satisfying tasks followed immediately after the cessation of hostilities. It was the preparation of maps to assist in the recovery of our prisoners of war in SWPA. It was an urgent commitment readily undertaken.'<ref name=\"fitz1980\" />\n\nThe achievements of the Corps during the Second World War were its greatest contributions to the nation than at any other time during its existence. This was duly recognised in 1948 when King George VI granted the title 'Royal' to the Australian Survey Corps.<ref name=fitz1980 />\n\nSixteen members of the Australian Survey Corps, or soldiers serving with Corps units, died during the war and are commemorated on the [[Australian War Memorial]] Roll of Honour. Four members of the Corps were formally recognised with awards and nineteen members were mentioned-in-despatches.<ref>Australian Government Gazette, 6 March 1947</ref>\n\nAustralian Survey Corps units during the Second World War were:<ref name=fitz1980 />\n* 2nd/1st Australian Army Topographical Survey Company, formerly 2nd/1st Corps Field Survey Company RAE \u2013 Middle East, New Guinea, Hollandia and Morotai\n* No 6 Aust Army Topographical Survey Company, formerly No 2 Army Topographical Survey Company, absorbed Army/Land Headquarters Survey Company \u2013 Victoria, Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland, New Guinea, New Britain\n* Land Headquarters Cartographic Company, formerly Army Headquarters Cartographic Company \u2013 Melbourne and Bendigo Victoria\n* No 2 Aust Field Survey Company \u2013 absorbed the 2 MD Field Survey Unit RAE(M) and Australian Survey Corps (P) No 3 Survey Sect \u2013 New South Wales, Queensland, Dutch New Guinea, New Guinea, New Britain, Bougainville\n* No 3 Aust Field Survey Company \u2013 absorbed the 3 MD Field Survey Unit RAE(M) and Australian Survey Corps (P) No 1 Survey Sect \u2013 Victoria, New Guinea, Queensland\n* No 4 Aust Field Survey Company \u2013 Western Australia\n* No 5 Aust Field Survey Company, formerly 1 Aust Field Survey Company which absorbed the 1 MD Field Survey Unit RAE(M) \u2013 Queensland, Dutch New Guinea, Labuan and Balikpapan in Borneo\n* No 7 Field Survey Section, formerly 7th Military District Survey Section, Northern Territory Force Field Survey Section and 1 Aust Field Survey Section \u2013 Northern Territory\n* No 8 Aust Field Survey Section, formerly New Guinea Field Survey Section and No 2 Field Survey Section \u2013 New Guinea\n* No 1 Mobile Lithographic Section, formerly 2 Army Survey Mobile Reproduction Section \u2013 Melbourne, Brisbane and Morotai\n* No 11 Aust Field Survey Depot \u2013 Bendigo\n* No 12 Aust Field Survey Depot \u2013 Queensland and Morotai\n* No 13 Aust Field Survey Depot \u2013 Sydney, New Guinea\n* Field Survey Training Depot supporting 3 Aust Field Survey Company \u2013 Victoria\n\nIn addition there were Survey Directorates and Survey Staff on formation headquarters:<ref name=fitz1980 />\n* General Headquarters South-West Pacific Area\n* Advanced Land Headquarters \u2013 Melbourne, Brisbane, Hollandia and Morotai\n* Headquarters 1st Australian Army\n* Headquarters 1st Australian Corps \u2013 Morotai\n* Headquarters 2nd Australian Corps\n* Headquarters New Guinea Force\n* Headquarters Northern Territory Force\n* Headquarters of Queensland, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania Lines of Communication areas\n* Headquarters Kanga Force in New Guinea\n* Headquarters Merauke Force in Dutch New Guinea\n\nAt the end of the Second World War, which by the nature of the total war demanded the best collective capability that the nation could assemble, the Australian Survey Corps was the best organised, best manned and best equipped geodetic and topographic survey and mapping organisation in Australia. The Director of Survey expected that the organisation would play a major role in the future survey and mapping of Australia.<ref name=fitz1980 />\n\n===Post Second World War ===\n====Defence survey and mapping programmes (not including Defence international cooperation)====\nAfter the Second World War the Corps reverted to its peace time role of the military survey of Australia retaining a capability in the Permanent Force Interim Army in 1946, and the Australian Regular Army from 1947 with a desired Corps strength of 460 all ranks, although a strength of 400 was not reached until the early 1960s. By 1950 the all ranks numbers were down to 210 as civilian employment opportunities significantly improved. The Australian Survey Corps structure and size was both the force-in-being and the base for expansion in war. In the early post-war years the Corps continued mainly with the 'one-mile' map military survey programme and provided Defence assistance to nation building projects for water conservation and settlement in the [[Burdekin River]] basin in Queensland (194x\u20131949), investigative surveys for the [[Snowy River|Snowy River Diversion Scheme]] (1946\u20131949) in New South Wales and Victoria, surveys for water flows between the [[Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee]] and [[Murray River]]s near [[Urana, New South Wales]] (1946), production of maps for the 1947 Australian Census and survey and mapping projects for the [[Woomera Test Range|Woomera Rocket Range]] (1946\u20131953) in South Australia and Western Australia and the atomic test range at [[Maralinga]] in South Australia. Corps units were established in each of the regional military districts, except Tasmania and Northern Territory, and a survey school was established in Victoria.<ref name=cc2000 /><ref name=jensen2011>Jensen, Peter A, Lieutenant-Colonel RA Svy/RAE, ''Post-World War II Topographic Mapping by the Royal Australian Survey Corps'' paper presented at the Mapping Sciences Institute of Australia Conference 2011 \u2013 100 years of National Topographic Mapping, Feb 2011</ref>\n\nIn 1956 Australia adopted decimal/metric scales for mapping, largely for military interoperability with major allies and the global trend. After the 'one-mile' military maps were discontinued in 1959, and although Defence preferred 1:50,000 maps for tactical operations, it recognised the resources needed for such a programme over large regional areas of Australia and accepted the 1:100,000 map as a practical substitute with 1:50,000 maps over specific areas of interest and military training areas.  Then in 1983 Defence endorsed a program for more than 2600 scale 1:50,000 maps in Defence priority areas in north and north-west Australia, its territories and the main land communication routes. By 1996 the Corps had completed more than 1900 of these maps by \u2013 field surveys using mainly US TRANSIT and GPS satellite positioning systems and aircraft mounted laser terrain profiling, new coverage aerial photography, aerotriangulation, compilation and cartographic completion on computer assisted mapping systems and produced both digital and printed topographic products.\n\nProduction of the military specification Joint Operation Graphics scale 1:250,000 is mentioned in the section \"National Survey and Mapping Programmes\" below.\n\nIn addition, there was a miscellany of surveys, maps and information produced by the Corps for units of each of the Armed Services. These included: production of air navigation charts for the Royal Australian Air Force covering Australia and a large area of its region totalling about eight percent of the earth's surface; printing hydrographic charts for the Hydrographer Royal Australian Navy; joint and single service training area special surveys, maps and models including live fire requirements; vital asset protection maps; safeguarding maps for ammunition depots; digital terrain data and models for command and control, communications, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, simulation, weapons and geographic information systems; photomaps using air and satellite photography.<ref>''The Royal Australian Survey Corps \u2013 Products Catalogue 1993'', DEF/MISC/6307, 1993</ref>\n\nCorps units, officers and soldiers were deployed on operations and conflicts of various types including:<ref name=cc2000 />\n* 1946 \u2013 staff posted to [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]], Japan\n* 1955\u20131960 \u2013 [[Malayan Emergency|Malayan Campaign]], officers posted to Force Headquarters\n* 1965 \u2013 1st Topographical Survey Troop raised in Sydney NSW based at Randwick\n* 1966\u20131971 Detachment 1st Topographical Survey Troop deployed with the [[1st Australian Task Force]] in Vietnam, in 1967 re-designated A Section 1st Topographical Survey Troop\n* 1975 \u2013 [[Cyclone Tracy]] \u2013 rapid response production of [[orthophotomap]]s and a senior Corps officer seconded as Staff Officer to the Army General commanding the emergency operations\n* 1987 \u2013 [[Operation Morris Dance]] \u2013 rapid response mapping of Fiji\n* 1988 \u2013 Operation Sailcloth \u2013 rapid response mapping of Vanuatu\n* 1990\u20131991 \u2013 [[Operation Desert Shield|Operations Desert Shield]] and [[Operation Desert Storm|Desert Storm]], Corps officers posted in United States and United Kingdom mapping agencies and units on operations\n* 1992 \u2013 support to ADF elements of UN peacekeeping force in Western Sahara\n* 1993 \u2013 support to ADF elements of UN peacekeeping force in Somalia\n* 1993 \u2013 Corps soldiers posted to [[Australian contribution to UNTAC in Cambodia 1992\u20131993|UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]]\n* 1995 \u2013 Corps officers posted to [[UNPROFOR|UN Protection Force]] Headquarters in Bosnia-Herzegovina\n\n====Defence international cooperation====\nCommencing in 1954, the Corps was again involved in surveys and mapping the New Guinea area, initially in cooperation with the United States [[Army Map Service]] for two years, and again as solely an Australian force from the early 1960s.  The 1956 survey (Project Cutlass) of ship-to-shore triangulation included a 300 kilometre theodolite and chain traverse on New Ireland. From 1962 the Corps resumed geodetic surveys as part of the National Geodetic Survey, linking to the global US HIRAN survey and the high order Division of National Mapping traverse and triangulation through the PNG highlands. There was a continuous Survey Corps presence in Papua New Guinea (PNG) from 1971 to 1995, with 8th Field Survey Squadron raised in PNG and based at [[Popondetta]], [[Wewak]] and [[Port Moresby]] for geodetic surveys, topographic surveys, map compilation, field completion of compiled maps, to support the Papua New Guinea Defence Force and to provide advice to PNG National Mapping Bureau. During this period the Corps completed the national/defence mapping programme of scale 1:100,000 topographic maps covering the entire country, the derived 1:250,000 Joint Operations Graphic \u2013 Ground and Air charts, large scale military city orthophotomaps and participated with the Royal Australian Navy in beach surveys of most of the coastline. In the 1970s up to 60% of the Corps' capability was engaged on PNG surveys and mapping.<ref>Laing, A.W. Colonel (Retd) RA Svy, ''The End of an Era \u2013 A short history of the Royal Australian Survey Corps' involvement in mapping, charting and geodesy in Papua New Guinea in the period 1942\u20131995'' unpublished 1995</ref> This mapping programme was based on high altitude (40,000 feet) air photography, acquired by the Royal Australian Air Force using [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra bombers]] fitted with Wild RC10 mapping cameras (Operation Skai Piksa), supported by Survey Corps surveyors and photogrammetrists to plan the photography requirements and for quality control to ensure that the photography met the high technical standards for the subsequent mapping processes.\n\nUnder the Defence Cooperation Programme, the Corps completed many cooperative and collaborative projects with nations in Australia's area of strategic interest. These projects included ground surveys, definition of geodetic datums, air photography, assistance with definition of Exclusive Economic Zones, mapping, provision of equipment and technology transfer and training of officers and technicians. Projects commenced in 1970 in Indonesia and expanded over 25 years to include Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati, Nauru, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Western Samoa. Technical Advisers were posted to national survey and mapping organisations in Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.<ref name=cc2000 />\n\nAll field survey operations outside of Australia, and indeed in Australia, would not have been possible without essential support of most other Army Corps (Engineers; Signals; Aviation \u2013 Cessna, [[Pilatus PC-6 Porter|Porter]], [[GAF Nomad|Nomad]], [[Bell H-13 Sioux|Sioux]], [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|Kiowa]]; Chaplains, Medical, Dental, Transport, Ordnance, Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Pay, Catering, Service), the Royal Australian Navy ([[Australian Hydrographic Service|Hydrographic Service]], Landing Craft, Patrol Boats) and at times the Royal New Zealand Navy (Hydrographic Service), the Royal Australian Air Force (Canberra, [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Hercules]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|Caribou]], [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|Iroquois]]) and civil charter fixed wing and helicopters for aerial survey work and transport.\n\nTwo members of the Australian Defence Force died on military survey operations in the 1970s in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia and are commemorated on the [[Australian War Memorial]] Roll of Honour.\n\nAssociations with other Armies commenced during the First World War and for more than 50 years after the Second World War the Corps participated in mapping, charting and geodesy projects for standardisation and interoperability with major allies including Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. From the 1960s, the Corps participated in cooperative and collaborative geodetic satellite programs with the United States, firstly astro-triangulation of passive satellites Echo and Pageos being observed with Wild BC4 cameras at [[Thursday Island]] in Queensland, [[Narrabri]] in New South Wales, [[Perth]] in Western Australia and [[Cocos Island]], a TRANET fixed station at [[Smithfield, South Australia|Smithfield]] in South Australia in the global network observing US Navy Navigation Satellites (TRANSIT) from 1976 to 1993 and the first observations of [[Global Positioning System|US Global Positioning System]] (GPS) satellites in Australia, at Smithfield, during the development and early operational phases of the system from 1981 to 1994.<ref name=jensen2011 /> The Corps managed bi-lateral Defence and Army map exchange arrangements with major allies and regional nations. Personnel exchange programs included Canada, United Kingdom and United States.\n\n====Participation in national survey and mapping programmes====\nIn 1945 the National Mapping Council (NMC) of Australia, comprising Commonwealth and State authorities, was formed to coordinate survey and mapping activities after the Second World War. Despite the huge wartime mapping achievements of producing 224 'four-mile' strategic maps and 397 'one-mile' tactical maps, there was much to be done for a basic coverage of reliable topographic maps for national development and defence.<ref name=fitz1980 /> In 1947 a National Mapping Section in the Department of Interior was established and together with the Survey Corps commenced work on the 1954 Cabinet approved general purpose (national development and defence) national topographic map programme, initially the 'four-mile' map then soon after scale 1:250,000 maps (series R502).  Army agreed that when not required for solely military purposes, Survey Corps units would be available to work in the Defence priority areas in the Government approved national geodetic survey and topographic mapping programmes. This programme involved control surveys by astronomical fixes, theodolite and chain triangulation and traverse by theodolite and electro-magnetic distance measurement and all aspects of map compilation from aerial photography, final cartography and map printing.  The Corps' geodetic surveys were integrated with other Commonwealth and State Government surveys to create the NMC sponsored Australian Geodetic Datum 1966 (AGD66) and the associated Australian Map Grid 1966 (AMG66) of Australia and Papua New Guinea and the Australian Height Datum 1971 (AHD71). By 1968 the Corps had completed its commitment of about half of the 540 series R502 maps and it then embarked on the Defence priority part of the 1965 Cabinet endorsed national programme of general purpose scale 1:100,000 topographic maps. This programme required densification of the national geodetic and height survey networks with mapping quality control surveys of Cape York, Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Northern Territory and north-west Western Australia using mainly airborne electromagnetic distance measurement systems (Aerodist). The Corps completed its commitment of 862 of these maps in 1982.\n\nIn areas of higher defence interest the Survey Corps replaced the series R502 1:250,000 maps with the military specification 1:250,000 Joint Operation Graphic (JOG) Ground and the companion Air version using materials from the 1:100,000 and Defence 1:50,000 mapping programmes and from other suitable sources.\n\n====Units and command staff post-Second World War====\n* Army Headquarters Directorate of Survey \u2013 Army\n* Headquarters Field Force Command \u2013 Senior Staff Officer and Survey Section\n* [[Army Survey Regiment]] based at [[Bendigo, Victoria]], formerly AHQ Survey Regiment and Southern Command Field Survey Section, AHQ Cartographic Unit, LHQ Cartographic Company and AHQ Cartographic Company\n* [[1st Field Survey Squadron]] based at Gaythorne and [[Enoggera Barracks]] [[Brisbane]], Qld, formerly Northern Command Field Survey Section and Northern Command Field Survey Unit \u2013 Queensland, Territory Papua and New Guinea\n* [[1st Topographic Survey Squadron]], now part of the [[Royal Australian Engineers]], based at [[Enoggera Barracks]] in [[Brisbane]], formed from 1st Field Survey Squadron and 1st Division Survey Section\n* [[2nd Field Survey Squadron]] based at [[Sydney]], NSW, formerly Eastern Command Field Survey Section and Eastern Command Field Survey Unit \u2013 New South Wales, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, nations of South West Pacific\n* [[4th Field Survey Squadron]] including a Reserve component, based at Keswick Barracks, [[Adelaide]], South Australia, formerly Central Command Field Survey Section and Central Command Field Survey Unit \u2013 South Australia, Northern Territory, Papua and New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu\n* [[5th Field Survey Squadron]] including a Reserve component, based [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], formerly Western Command Field Survey Section and Western Command Field Survey Unit \u2013 Western Australia, Indonesia\n* New Guinea Field Survey Unit\n* [[8th Field Survey Squadron]] raised and disbanded in Papua New Guinea based at Popondetta, Wewak, Port Moresby\n* 1st Topographical Survey Company (CMF) based in Sydney, NSW\n* 2nd Topographical Survey Company (CMF) based in Melbourne, VIC (an element was absorbed by Army Survey Regiment when the company was disbanded)\n* 1st Topographical Survey Troop \u2013 raised and based in Sydney NSW\n* 1st Topographic Survey Troop \u2013 Detachment thereof later re designated A Sect in Vietnam, B Sect based in Sydney, NSW\n* 9th Topographic Survey Troop (CMF) based in Sydney, NSW\n* 7th Military Geographic Information Section based at Darwin, NT\n* ANZUK Survey Map Depot, Singapore \u2013 formerly 16 Field Survey Depot formerly AHQ Field Survey Depot Detachment\n* Army Map Depot, formerly AHQ Field Survey Depot and Army Field Survey Depot \u2013 Victoria\n* School of Military Survey \u2013 initially based at [[Balcombe, Victoria]] and subsequently at [[Bonegilla, Victoria]]. In 1996 the School was integrated into the School of Military Engineering as the [[Geomatic Engineering Wing]] now at [[Holsworthy Barracks]] in [[Sydney, New South Wales]]\n* Joint Intelligence Organisation Printing Section\n\n====Re-integration with the Royal Australian Engineers====\nThe Survey Corps was subject to many Government and Defence reviews since the 1950s, with seven from the early 1980s. Review outcomes led to many reorganisations. In the late 1980s and early 1990s efficiency reviews led to an Army direction that the non-core strategic mapping functions of the Corps were to be tested as part of the Defence Commercial Support Program. Army decisions as part of that review were that: the combat support survey force (1st Topographical Survey Squadron) would be increased significantly; the non-core work, mainly systematic mapping of Australia would be performed by a new Army agency with civilian personnel; and, that the core strategic mapping would be retained by Army until it could be transferred to Defence Intelligence. This last component was achieved in 2000 when the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation (now [[Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation]]) was formed. \n\nThese changes meant that the majority of Survey Corps staff positions would be removed, and so in September 1995 the Chief of the General Staff (CGS) decided that the remaining combat support force and training force functions of the Corps would be once again integrated with the combat force and training force of the Royal Australian Engineers.\n\nAt the integration parade of the two Corps on 1 July 1996, 81 years after the formation of the Australian Survey Corps, the CGS said that \"Since 1915 the Survey Corps has not just been a major contributor to the tactical success of the Australian Army in two World Wars and other conflicts, it has played an outstanding role in the building of this nation \u2013 the Commonwealth of Australia \u2013 and the building of other nations such as Papua New Guinea\".\n\nIn 2014 the 1st Topographical Survey Squadron RAE came under the command of the [[1st Intelligence Battalion (Australia)|1st Intelligence Battalion]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Geospatial Intelligence \u2013 extracted from \u2018Australian Sapper\u2019 2014|journal=Royal Australian Survey Corps Association Queensland Branch Bulletin|edition=Christmas Edition \u2013 No 61|url=http://www.rasurvey.org/bulletins/Bulletin%2061%20Dec%2015.pdf|date=December 2015|p=5}}</ref>  In 2018 the Army geospatial capability, less the field surveying capability, was transferred from RAE to Aust Int Corps, 1st Topographical Survey Squadron RAE was transferred to [[Australian Army Intelligence Corps|Australian Intelligence Corps]] and retitled 5 Company 1st Intelligence Battalion and Geomatic Engineering Wing was retitled Geospatial Intelligence Wing and transferred from School of Military Engineering to Defence Force School of Intelligence.\n\n==Corps Appointments and its people==\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II approved the appointment, on 1 July 1988, of Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales as Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Australian Survey Corps.<ref name=cc2000 />\n\nColonels Commandant (honorary appointment), Royal Australian Survey Corps:<ref name=cc2000 />\n* Brigadier D.

Lemon (January 1991 \u2013 June 1996)\n\nThe high reputation and esteem in which the Corps was held within the Australian Defence Force, the surveying and mapping profession and amongst Australia's military allies and friends was based on its achievements largely possible only by the quality of its people. This was greatly enhanced by the camaraderie and espirit-de-corps of the members of the Corps, knowing the high military value and high quality of the work that they produced. After World War II eight Corps officers were later appointed Surveyors-General or Directors of Survey/Mapping/Lands in the States or Commonwealth organisations. Many personnel went on to leadership positions in professional institutions. The first five members of the Institution of Surveyors, Australia, recognised for outstanding service to the profession and awarded a special gold medial, had all been officers of the Survey Corps.<ref name=cc2000 />\n\nFrom the 1960s, most Corps officers were tertiary educated with many at the post-graduate level in either mapping or computer disciplines and military command and staff training. This was the key to understanding the potential, application and implementation of emerging technologies and techniques across all aspects of Corps capability. Corps soldier training was both broad within a trade, across Corps trades and specific to specialised equipment with military training for various levels of leadership. Officers and soldiers posted outside Corps positions were highly regarded. Until the 1970s the Corps sponsored and trained soldiers in trades other than the mapping related trades essential to its operations. These included drivers, storemen and clerks. After some rationalisation the Corps retained career and training responsibility for all mapping related trades, and also photographers (non-public relations), illustrators and projectionists who were posted mainly to training institutions and headquarters.\n\nMore than 6,300 people served in the Survey Section (RAE), Australian Survey Corps units and Royal Australian Survey Corps units from 1910 to 1996, including more than 580 women from 1942 to 1996. A Survey Corps Nominal Roll 1915-1996 may be accessed from the front page of the website of the Royal Australian Survey Corps Association linked on External Links below.\n\nThe Corps participated in the national service scheme in the 1950s, training and maintaining two Citizen Military Force topographic survey companies in Sydney and Melbourne from 1951 to 1957, mainly for national servicemen to complete their obligations. National servicemen then served with the Survey Corps in Vietnam from 1966 to 1971.\n\nThe Army Audio Visual Unit was the only Corps unit not to have a mapping related role.\n\n==Equipment, Technology and Techniques==\nRA Svy had the enviable military, international and national reputation of leading innovation, development and implementation of many generations of state-of-the-art technology and techniques across all areas of surveying, mapping and printing, striving to improve efficiencies.

As one of the principal military survey units in Australia, the role of the Royal Australian Survey Corps was to provide the maps, aeronautical charts, hydrographical charts and [[Geodesy|geodetic]] and control survey data required for land combat operations. Functional responsibilities associated with this role were: theatre wide geodetic survey for \u2013 artillery, naval gunfire and close air support \u2013 mapping and charting \u2013 navigation systems \u2013 command and control, communications, intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance systems; map production and printing for new maps and charts, plans, overprints, battle maps, air photo mosaics and photomaps, rapid map and chart revision; map holding and map distribution; production, maintenance and distribution of digital topographic information and products. RA Svy survey and mapping information was, and still is, a key information source for [[geospatial intelligence]].\n\nThe operational doctrine was that the combat force deployed into the area of operations with topographic products adequate for planning, force insertion and initial conduct of tactical operations, that new products and broad area updates of the topographic base would be provided by the support area and communication zone survey forces, and that the combat support survey force in the area of operations would update the topographic base, add tactical operational and intelligence information and provide the value-added products required by the combat force.<ref name=cc2000>Coulthard-Clark, CD, 2000, ''Australia's Military Mapmakers \u2013 The Royal Australian Survey Corps 1915\u201396'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-551343-6}}</ref>\n\nThe Historical Collection of the Survey Corps is maintained by the Australian Army Museum of Military Engineering at Holsworthy Barracks, south-west Sydney, New South Wales. Survey Corps Associations of ex-members, family and friends are located in Adelaide, Bendigo, Brisbane, Canberra, Perth and Sydney. Many wartime maps produced by the Survey Corps are in the [[Australian War Memorial]] collection, while all of the maps produced by the Corps are also in the national collection at the [[National Library of Australia]]. All of these are available to the public and some are on-line.\n\n==History==\n{{Australian Army Arms}}\n\n===Origins===\nAustralia's first surveyor, Lieutenant August Alt, was an Army officer of the [[8th (The King's) Regiment of Foot]], which arrived in Australia with the [[First Fleet]] in January 1788.<ref name=reilly1983>Reilly, SE, ''Soldiers and Surveyors'', 1983; The Australian Surveyor, March 1983, Vol 31, No 5, p 315</ref> Eighteen years before him, [[James Cook|Lieutenant James Cook]], Royal Navy, used his knowledge and skills of topographic survey by plane-table for his surveys and charting of the east coast. This graphical method of topographic survey, first used before 1600, was the mainstay of the Australian Survey Corps for the first 20 years and used in the two world wars and occasionally much later. Cook had learned surveying in Canada from Royal Engineer Samuel Holland who then (1758) was the first Surveyor-General of British North America.<ref>Mundle, Rob ''Cook From Sailor to Legend'' Harper Collins Publishers, 2013</ref>\n\nFor 113 years of colonisation after the arrival of the First Fleet, much of the mapping of Australia, mainly for exploration, settlement and development, was supervised and conducted by naval and military officers. These officers included the well known explorers and surveyors: Captain [[Matthew Flinders]], Royal Navy; Lieutenant [[William Dawes (Royal Marines officer)]], (New South Wales); Lieutenant [[Philip Parker King]], Royal Navy (mainly Tasmania, Western Australia and Northern Territory), Lieutenant [[John Oxley]], Royal Navy, (New South Wales); Lieutenant Colonel Sir [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] (New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland); Captain [[Charles Sturt]] (New South Wales and South Australia); Lieutenant [[John Septimus Roe]], Royal Navy (Western Australia), and Colonel [[William Light]] (South Australia). After 100 years of settlement some topographic maps had been produced for both public and private use but only a few maps were of any real military utility. The colonial part-time Defence Forces prepared small-area training manoeuvre maps and some colonies had produced small systematic topographic surveys for defence of the main ports of trade and commerce in the 1880s and 1890s. That is not to say that the need for topographic mapping was not a government and public concern but there were only minor attempts to allocate appropriate public resources.<ref name=lines>Lines, John D ''Australia on Paper \u2013 The Story of Australian Mapping'', Fortune Publications, 1992, {{ISBN|0 646 09769 5}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901, the Defence Act 1903 made provision for military survey but nothing was immediately done to address the matter. Most recently a royal commission into the way the British Army had conducted itself in South Africa (Boer War) found that the troops had to fight without adequate topographic information. Indeed, accurate maps of the Boer republics did not exist. The Times' history of the Boer War 1899\u20131902 included: 'The chief deduction to be made in the matter is that no efforts during a war will compensate for the lack of a proper topographical survey made in peace time. Maps are a necessity to a modern army, and the expense of making them is very small compared with the cost of a campaign.' <ref>Amery, ''The Times History of the War in South Africa 1899\u20131902'', vol 6, p350</ref>\n\nIn early 1907, Colonel [[William Bridges (general)|William Bridges]] then Chief of Intelligence and the senior Australian military officer recommended to Defence Minister Sir [[Thomas Ewing (Australian politician)|Thomas Ewing]], member for [[Richmond, New South Wales]], that a Chief of the General Staff should be appointed in place of Chief of Intelligence and that a General Staff be established.  The Minister, who was a licensed surveyor, was unimpressed by the advice preferring to continue for the time being with the arrangements of a Military Board.  He was concerned that there were no plans for mobilization, or local defence, noting that \"there were few reliable maps, even of the most important localities\".  These were the important national defence issues that Ewing recommended to Bridges for his immediate attention.<ref name=mordike1992>Mordike, J, ''An Army for a Nation'', 1992, Allen and Unwin, p 193</ref> The [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]] and the Government considered a number of options to address the important and urgent need for a military survey, finally deciding in late 1907 to raise the [[Australian Army Intelligence Corps|Australian Intelligence Corps]] (AIC) manned by part-time [[Citizen Military Force]] (CMF) officers who were trained in surveying or draughting and whose duties included the preparation of strategic and tactical maps and plans. In Victoria the military survey was the responsibility of Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Monash]] who was then the senior AIC militia officer in the 3rd Military District.<ref name=cc2000 /> By 1909 the limitations of this arrangement were evident, and after advice from a senior British Army Royal Engineer Survey Officer, it was decided to embark on a systematic military survey conducted full-time by a Survey Section, [[Royal Australian Engineers]] (RAE) (Permanent Forces), allotted for duty under the supervision of the AIC. The Section was to be commanded by an Australian survey officer and staffed by Australian warrant officer draughtsmen and non-commissioned officers (NCO) topographers and four NCO topographers on an initial two-year loan from the British Army Royal Engineers.\n\nThe Royal Engineer topographers (Corporal Lynch, Lance-Corporals Barrett, Davies and Wilcox) arrived in Melbourne on 11 April 1910 and on 16 April 1910, draughtsman Warrant Officer John J Raisbeck was the first Australian appointed to the Survey Section and soon after he was joined by draughtsman Warrant Officer Class 1 George Constable. Raisbeck was a survey draughtsman from the Department of Mines, Bendigo, and a Second-Lieutenant in the CMF 9th Light Horse Regiment. He relinquished his commission to enlist in the Permanent Military Forces. He was granted the Honorary rank Second-Lieutenant and was retired with the rank Lieutenant-Colonel 33 years later at age 63 years having served in France in World War I and in World War II. Fitzgerald said that JJ Raisbeck was the 'pioneer of military mapping in Australia'.<ref name=fitz1980 />\n\nThe first officer appointed to the position Lieutenant Survey Section RAE (Permanent) was Lieutenant William Lawrence Whitham, a licensed surveyor from South Australia, having been highly recommended by the Surveyor-General South Australia. He assumed his appointment on 1 July 1910 at which time there were seven members of the Section. All men were professional surveyors and draftsman. CMF officers of the AIC in the Military District Headquarters supervised the work of the Section. In 1912 the Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia State Governments each agreed to loan a Lands Department Survey Officer to the Survey Section RAE for two years to supervise the work of the Section in each State. Each Survey Officer was a militia officer in the AIC. The Section was divided into two sub-sections and employed in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia producing scale one-mile-to-one-inch military maps ('one-mile' map) mainly of areas around cities and key infrastructure. By mid-1913 the Section had completed topographic field sheets by plane-tabling for eight maps around Newcastle, Melbourne and Canberra. The initial method of using parish plans to position the topographic detail was soon found to be inadequate and a geodetic subsection was established in 1914 to provide surveys by geodetic triangulation as spatial frameworks for the field sheets produced by the topographers. The triangulation work started at Werribee south-west of Melbourne and proceeded west along the coast to Warrnambool. This work included the 1860 Geodetic Survey of Victoria where appropriate \u2013 much of which was produced by Royal Engineer officers. The AIC was disbanded in 1914 but the work of the Survey Section continued under the supervision and control of the Intelligence Section of the General Staff under the general direction of the Chief of the General Staff (CGS).<ref name=cc2000 /><ref name=sargent1990>Sargent, Clem, Lieutenant-Colonel RA Svy, 1990, ''The Royal Australian Survey Corps 1915\u20131990''</ref><ref name=bulletin>Royal Australian Survey Corps Association Bulletin 1965 to 1989</ref><ref name=sms1985>School of Military Survey,1985, ''The Chronology of RA Svy Corps'', Edition 2</ref>\n\n===First World War===\nThe outbreak of the First World War on 4 August 1914 did not, at first, seriously affect the work of the members of the Section as the highest priority and urgent work of the Permanent Forces was military survey for defence of the major cities and ports in Australia. Indeed, the Section gained an increase in personnel and equipment.<ref name=quinlan1943>Quinlan, Cecil Verdon, Major, Survey Section RAE 1913\u201315, ''Australian Map Makers'', The Australian Surveyor, Sept 1, 1943</ref> At that stage it was understood that the British Army would provide the maps required for the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) war fighting. However, by 17 August the Draughting sub-Section of the Survey Section RAE in Melbourne had prepared a map of the north-east frontier of France for reproduction of 1,000 copies by photo-lithography by the Victorian Lands Department for issue to the Australian Imperial Force.<ref>Chief of the General Staff War Diary 17 August 1914 \u2013 Letter to Secretary of the Department of Lands, Victoria</ref>\n\nOn 3 July 1915, Military Order 396 of 1915 promulgated that His Excellency the Governor-General has been pleased to approve of: 'A Corps to be called the Australian Survey Corps being raised as a unit of the Permanent Military Forces. All officers, warrant officers, non-commissioned officers and men now serving in the Survey Section of the Royal Australian Engineers being transferred to the Australian Survey Corps with their present ranks and seniority.'<ref name=cc2000 /> The effective date of the foundation of the Corps was 1 July 1915 \u2013 on that day there were two officers and seventeen warrant officers and NCOs of the Corps (at that stage there were no sappers in the Corps). The Australian Survey Corps was placed fourth in the Order of Precedence of Corps after the Royal Australian Engineers.\n\nRaising the Australian Survey Corps had nothing to do with supporting the AIF then at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], but provided for the key tasks of military survey of the high defence priority areas of Australia without direction or control of Intelligence Staff or the Royal Australian Engineers. The first Officer Commanding Australian Survey Corps was Honorary Captain Cecil Verdon Quinlan who had been appointed Lieutenant Survey Section RAE in March 1913 after Lieutenant Whitham resigned. Quinlan later gave credit to the creation of the Australian Survey Corps to the then General Staff Director of Military Operations \u2013 Major [[Brudenell White]] (later General Sir, Chief of the General Staff).<ref name=quinlan1943 />\n\nSurvey Corps members started to enlist in the AIF in November 1915, with three Warrant Officer draughtsmen (Murray, Shiels and MacDonald) working with the Headquarters of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] by late 1916. Then in late 1917, General Headquarters in France/Belgium requested survey personnel for topographic surveys in that theatre and a volunteer Australian Survey Corps AIF draft of four officers and seven NCOs arrived in France early in 1918. Military Survey in Australia then came to a virtual standstill when the AIF members departed for the Middle East and the Western Front. 2nd Lieutenant Raisbeck, Sergeants Anderson and Clements and Corporal Watson served with the Australian Corps Topographic Section in France/Belgium and Lieutenants Vance and Lynch, 2nd Lieutenant Davies, Sergeants Clews and Rossiter and Corporals Blaikie and Roberts served with General Headquarters Royal Engineer Survey Companies employed amongst other things on evaluating the suitability of the French triangulation networks for the purposes of military survey and mapping.\n\nIn late 1916, Warrant Officer Class 1 Hector E McMurtrie was enlisted into the Corps as a draughtsman for duty with the survey staff (not Australian Survey Corps) working on land title surveys for the military administration by the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force in the New Guinea area. In 1919 he died from a service related illness, and is commemorated on the [[Australian War Memorial]] Roll of Honour.  He was the first Australian Survey Corps member to die in war.\n\nIn early 1918 fourteen Corps members were serving with the AIF and eight were in Australia working on the military survey. One Survey Corps member (Warrant Officer Class 1 Alan Stewart Murray) and one Topographic Section Topographer Corporal Stafford were awarded the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]] for mapping under enemy fire, Topographic Section Topographer Sergeant Finlason was recommended for a Military Medal but was awarded the [[Croix de guerre 1914\u20131918 (France)|French Croix De Guerre]], Topographic Section Draughtsman Sergeant Wightman was awarded the [[Meritorious Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Meritorious Service Medal]]. the Officer Commanding the 1st ANZAC Topographic Section in 1917 and the Australian Corps Topographic Section in 1918 Lieutenant Buchanan was awarded the [[Croix de guerre (Belgium)|Belgian Croix De Guerre]] and Topographic Section Lithographer Sergeant Dunstan was awarded the French Croix De Guerre. Warrant Officer Murray's citation for his work in [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Sinai and Palestine]] read \"for conspicuous gallantry and dedication to duty. For a prolonged period this Warrant Officer was engaged on surveying the area between the lines repeatedly working under machine gun fire and sniping. In order not to attract attention he usually worked alone with his plane table and instruments. Owing to his energy and coolness he has mapped a piece of country accurately and his work has been most valuable.\"  In March 1919 Warrant Officer Class 1 Norman Lyndhurst Shiels was mentioned in the despatches of the General Officer Commanding Egyptian Expeditionary Force, possibly for his work with the Royal Air Force in mapping from aerial photography.<ref name=cc2000 /><ref name=bulletin /><ref>National Archives of Australia, World War I personnel service records</ref>\n\n===Between the World Wars===\nWhen the AIF members returned to Australia in 1919 they were discharged and most were re-appointed to the Survey Section RAE (Permanent) or the Australian Survey Corps (Permanent). Military reorganisation after World War I, and the general reduction in military capability, saw the numbers reduced to fourteen all ranks. In 1920 the Corps was suspended and reverted, in title, to the Survey Section, RAE (Permanent). Mapping continued, mainly the 'one-mile' maps, albeit at a reduced rate consistent with the allocated resources, with priority given to areas around Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. By 1929 the Section had produced fifty-four 'one-mile' maps including five revised maps. Technical developments provided for improved efficiencies. These included use of single photographs and strips of air photographs to supplement ground surveys by plane-table for topographic detail. The first military map produced with a significant component of aerial photography flown by the Royal Australian Air Force was the Albury 'one-mile' map published in 1933. Compilation of this map highlighted inconsistencies in State triangulation systems and once again demonstrated the need for a national geodetic survey which had been identified by colonial survey officers in the 1890s.\n\nIn 1932, the Army decided that the Order in Council which created the Corps in 1915 had never been broken and so the title of the military survey unit was once again the Australian Survey Corps (Permanent Forces) with the personnel establishment of fourteen all ranks as it had been for twelve years. Recruiting recommenced and in 1935 the Corps establishment was raised to twenty-five all ranks. Increments allowed for a Survey (Topographic) Section to be based in each of three states, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, a Survey (Geodetic) Section and the Survey (Draughting) Section in Melbourne. Then in 1938, with war clouds once again on the horizon, a three-year Long Range Mapping Programme was approved, with additional funding bringing the total to ninety-seven all ranks. These extra resources would provide for a total of about thirty-five new '1 mile' maps each year. However, at the outbreak of the Second World War there were only fifty members in the Australian Survey Corps. Most of the men were professionally qualified, and the Corps was very knowledgeable of emerging technical developments which would improve efficiencies in map production. That there were no militia units of the Corps was due mainly to the fact that little progress in the mapping programme was achieved with part-time effort. The Corps was well equipped for the range of field survey and office mapping tasks with the exception of printing presses. Maps were printed by the Victorian State Government Printer. At this stage, just before the Second World War, the total coverage of military 'one-mile' maps was eighty-one maps or about {{convert|36000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} or only about 40% of the identified military mapping requirement at that stage.<ref name=raisbeck1937>Raisbeck, JJ Captain, Australian Survey Corps, ''A Short History of the Military Survey of Australia, 1907\u20131936'', The Australian Surveyor, Sept 1, 1937</ref><ref name=vance1940>Vance, TA Major, ''Mapping a Continent'', The Australian Surveyor, Sept 2, 1940</ref>\n\nSections (all Permanent Forces) from the end of the First World War to pre-Second World War were:\n* Survey Section, RAE\n* No 1 Survey (Draughting) Section (Melbourne)\n* No 1 Survey (Topographic) Section (Queensland, South Australia and Victoria)\n* No 2 Survey (Topographic) Section (Victoria)\n* No 3 Survey (Topographic) Section (New South Wales)\n* No 4 Survey (Geodetic) Section (triangulation Southern Queensland \u2013 New South Wales \u2013 Victoria \u2013 South Australia)\n\n===Second World War===\n[[File:AWM 022643 2 1st Australian Corps Field Survey Coy Syria 1941.jpg|thumb|Soldiers from the Australian 2/1st Corps Field Survey Company, near the Turkish\u2013Syrian border, December 1941, mapping the topography using a plane-table.]]\nIn July 1939 'Instructions for War \u2013 Survey' were issued.<ref name=fitz1980 /> This outlined the military survey organisation required to undertake an Emergency Mapping Programme to complete the outstanding Long Range Mapping Programme and the nucleus for expansion to war establishment. The Emergency Mapping Programme was initially for strategic mapping at scale four-miles-to-one-inch ('four-mile maps') covering a coastal strip 200 miles (300&nbsp;km) inland from Townsville to Port Augusta and 100 miles (200&nbsp;km) inland from Albany to Geraldton and key strategic areas in Tasmania and around Darwin and 'one-mile' maps of populated places. Map production was from existing State Lands Departments information and conducted jointly between State and Commonwealth agencies and Survey Corps units. The programme expanded to include more of Australia, New Guinea, New Britain and New Ireland and although many maps were of a preliminary standard only, providing general coverage critical at the time.\n\nInitially, the Australian Survey Corps continued its mapping for the defence of Australia, proceeded with basic survey triangulation and provided training cadre for new field and training units. In January 1940, Field Survey Units RAE (Militia) were established in 1st Military District \u2013 Queensland, 2nd Military District \u2013 New South Wales and 3rd Military District \u2013 Victoria to accelerate the mapping effort. Deputy Assistant Directors \u2013 Survey were appointed to Military District Headquarters to advise on survey needs and to liaise with State agencies. In April 1940 the 2/1 Corps Field Survey Company RAE was raised as part of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force for service overseas and a Survey staff was appointed to the formation (Corps) headquarters. In September 1940 significant expansion of the Australian Survey Corps was approved by Cabinet to include a Survey Directorate on Army Headquarters (AHQ) and higher formation headquarters, an AHQ Survey Company, an AHQ Cartographic Company, regional command field survey companies, a Survey Section 7th Military District (Darwin) and a Corps Survey Mobile Reproduction Section. Four militia Field Survey Companies were established in the regional commands (1 Field Survey Coy \u2013 Queensland, 2 Field Survey Coy \u2013 New South Wales, 3 Field Survey Coy \u2013 Victoria, 4 Field Survey Coy \u2013 Western Australia) absorbing the Australian Survey Corps Sections and the Field Survey Units RAE (M) in the Commands.\n\nIn early 1941, 2/1 Corps Field Survey Company RAE, sailed with the [[2nd Australian Imperial Force]], to provide survey and mapping to the Australian Corps in the Middle East theatre including Greece, Egypt, Cyrenaica and the border zones of Palestine, Syria, Trans-Jordan and Turkey. In response to the Japanese advance in the Pacific the 2/1 Corps Field Survey Company returned to Australia in early 1942 and over the next four years fifteen Australian Survey Corps units with various roles (including two Army level Topographical Survey Companies) provided survey and mapping support to military operations in the South West Pacific Area theatre of the war including Northern Territory, Papua, New Guinea, New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville, Dutch New Guinea, Borneo and the States of Australia in particular northern Australia. Women of the Australian Women's Army Service served in Survey units and formation headquarter sections in Australia and in New Guinea.<ref name=fitz1980 /><ref name=cc2000 />\n\nAcknowledgement of the value of survey support organic to the combat forces increased as the war progressed, with Survey Sections of 5th Field Survey Company assigned to both 7th Australian Infantry Division and 9th Australian Infantry Division for the large scale amphibious landings at Labuan and Balikpapan in Borneo. Later, the General Staff of Headquarters 1 Australian Corps said \"...never in this war have Australian troops been so well provided with accurate maps, sketches and photo reproductions...\" <ref name=fitz1980 />\n\nThe Corps produced more than 1440 new maps of the theatres of war (Middle East 28, Australian mainland 708, New Guinea area 364, Borneo 147, Mindanao Philippines 200), printing more than 3 million copies of the maps. The highly valued efforts of the Corps did not go unnoticed by senior commanders. Lieutenant-General [[Edmund Herring]], General Officer Commanding New Guinea Force, and Lieutenant-General [[John Northcott]], Chief of the General Staff, wrote letters of appreciation of the work of the Corps to the Director of Survey, Advanced Land Headquarters. General [[Douglas MacArthur]], Commander-in-Chief, South West Pacific Area wrote a letter of high commendation of Corps work to General [[Thomas Blamey]], Commander, Allied land Forces, South West Pacific Area. At Morotai, the Mobile Lithographic Section was given the privilege of preparing the Instrument of Surrender signed by Commander, Second Japanese Army and countersigned by General Blamey, Commander-in-Chief, Australian Military Forces. The unit then printed thousands of copies of the surrender document for souvenirs. At the end of the war more than half of the Corps strength of 1700 were on active service outside Australia.<ref name=fitz1980 /> Colonel Fitzgerald noted that 'One of the most satisfying tasks followed immediately after the cessation of hostilities. It was the preparation of maps to assist in the recovery of our prisoners of war in SWPA. It was an urgent commitment readily undertaken.'<ref name=fitz1980 />\n\nThe achievements of the Corps during the Second World War were its greatest contributions to the nation than at any other time during its existence. This was duly recognised in 1948 when King George VI granted the title 'Royal' to the Australian Survey Corps.<ref name=fitz1980 />\n\nSixteen members of the Australian Survey Corps, or soldiers serving with Corps units, died during the war and are commemorated on the [[Australian War Memorial]] Roll of Honour.

The Director of Survey expected that the organisation would play a major role in the future survey and mapping of Australia.<ref name=fitz1980 />\n\n===Post Second World War ===\n====Defence survey and mapping programmes (not including Defence international cooperation)====\nAfter the Second World War the Corps reverted to its peace time role of the military survey of Australia retaining a capability in the Permanent Force Interim Army in 1946, and the Australian Regular Army from 1947 with a desired Corps strength of 460 all ranks, although a strength of 400 was not reached until the early 1960s. By 1950 the all ranks numbers were down to 210 as civilian employment opportunities significantly improved. The Australian Survey Corps structure and size was both the force-in-being and the base for expansion in war. In the early post-war years the Corps continued mainly with the 'one-mile' map military survey programme and provided Defence assistance to nation building projects for water conservation and settlement in the [[Burdekin River]] basin in Queensland (194x\u20131949), investigative surveys for the [[Snowy River|Snowy River Diversion Scheme]] (1946\u20131949) in New South Wales and Victoria, surveys for water flows between the [[Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee]] and [[Murray River]]s near [[Urana, New South Wales]] (1946), production of maps for the 1947 Australian Census and survey and mapping projects for the [[Woomera Test Range|Woomera Rocket Range]] (1946\u20131953) in South Australia and Western Australia and the atomic test range at [[Maralinga]] in South Australia. Corps units were established in each of the regional military districts, except Tasmania and Northern Territory, and a survey school was established in Victoria.<ref name=cc2000 /><ref name=jensen2011>Jensen, Peter A, Lieutenant-Colonel RA Svy/RAE, ''Post-World War II Topographic Mapping by the Royal Australian Survey Corps'' paper presented at the Mapping Sciences Institute of Australia Conference 2011 \u2013 100 years of National Topographic Mapping, Feb 2011</ref>\n\nIn 1956 Australia adopted decimal/metric scales for mapping, largely for military interoperability with major allies and the global trend. After the 'one-mile' military maps were discontinued in 1959, and although Defence preferred 1:50,000 maps for tactical operations, it recognised the resources needed for such a programme over large regional areas of Australia and accepted the 1:100,000 map as a practical substitute with 1:50,000 maps over specific areas of interest and military training areas.  Then in 1983 Defence endorsed a program for more than 2600 scale 1:50,000 maps in Defence priority areas in north and north-west Australia, its territories and the main land communication routes. By 1996 the Corps had completed more than 1900 of these maps by \u2013 field surveys using mainly US TRANSIT and GPS satellite positioning systems and aircraft mounted laser terrain profiling, new coverage aerial photography, aerotriangulation, compilation and cartographic completion on computer assisted mapping systems and produced both digital and printed topographic products.\n\nProduction of the military specification Joint Operation Graphics scale 1:250,000 is mentioned in the section \"National Survey and Mapping Programmes\" below.\n\nIn addition, there was a miscellany of surveys, maps and information produced by the Corps for units of each of the Armed Services. These included: production of air navigation charts for the Royal Australian Air Force covering Australia and a large area of its region totalling about eight percent of the earth's surface; printing hydrographic charts for the Hydrographer Royal Australian Navy; joint and single service training area special surveys, maps and models including live fire requirements; vital asset protection maps; safeguarding maps for ammunition depots; digital terrain data and models for command and control, communications, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, simulation, weapons and geographic information systems; photomaps using air and satellite photography.<ref>''The Royal Australian Survey Corps \u2013 Products Catalogue 1993'', DEF/MISC/6307, 1993</ref>\n\nCorps units, officers and soldiers were deployed on operations and conflicts of various types including:<ref name=cc2000 />\n* 1946 \u2013 staff posted to [[British Commonwealth Occupation Force]], Japan\n* 1955\u20131960 \u2013 [[Malayan Emergency|Malayan Campaign]], officers posted to Force Headquarters\n* 1965 \u2013 1st Topographical Survey Troop raised in Sydney NSW based at Randwick\n* 1966\u20131971 Detachment 1st Topographical Survey Troop deployed with the [[1st Australian Task Force]] in Vietnam, in 1967 re-designated A Section 1st Topographical Survey Troop\n* 1975 \u2013 [[Cyclone Tracy]] \u2013 rapid response production of [[orthophotomap]]s and a senior Corps officer seconded as Staff Officer to the Army General commanding the emergency operations\n* 1987 \u2013 [[Operation Morris Dance]] \u2013 rapid response mapping of Fiji\n* 1988 \u2013 Operation Sailcloth \u2013 rapid response mapping of Vanuatu\n* 1990\u20131991 \u2013 [[Operation Desert Shield|Operations Desert Shield]] and [[Operation Desert Storm|Desert Storm]], Corps officers posted in United States and United Kingdom mapping agencies and units on operations\n* 1992 \u2013 support to ADF elements of UN peacekeeping force in Western Sahara\n* 1993 \u2013 support to ADF elements of UN peacekeeping force in Somalia\n* 1993 \u2013 Corps soldiers posted to [[Australian contribution to UNTAC in Cambodia 1992\u20131993|UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]]\n* 1995 \u2013 Corps officers posted to [[UNPROFOR|UN Protection Force]] Headquarters in Bosnia-Herzegovina\n\n====Defence international cooperation====\nCommencing in 1954, the Corps was again involved in surveys and mapping the New Guinea area, initially in cooperation with the United States [[Army Map Service]] for two years, and again as solely an Australian force from the early 1960s.  The 1956 survey (Project Cutlass) of ship-to-shore triangulation included a 300 kilometre theodolite and chain traverse on New Ireland. From 1962 the Corps resumed geodetic surveys as part of the National Geodetic Survey, linking to the global US HIRAN survey and the high order Division of National Mapping traverse and triangulation through the PNG highlands. There was a continuous Survey Corps presence in Papua New Guinea (PNG) from 1971 to 1995, with 8th Field Survey Squadron raised in PNG and based at [[Popondetta]], [[Wewak]] and [[Port Moresby]] for geodetic surveys, topographic surveys, map compilation, field completion of compiled maps, to support the Papua New Guinea Defence Force and to provide advice to PNG National Mapping Bureau. During this period the Corps completed the national/defence mapping programme of scale 1:100,000 topographic maps covering the entire country, the derived 1:250,000 Joint Operations Graphic \u2013 Ground and Air charts, large scale military city orthophotomaps and participated with the Royal Australian Navy in beach surveys of most of the coastline. In the 1970s up to 60% of the Corps' capability was engaged on PNG surveys and mapping.<ref>Laing, A.W. Colonel (Retd) RA Svy, ''The End of an Era \u2013 A short history of the Royal Australian Survey Corps' involvement in mapping, charting and geodesy in Papua New Guinea in the period 1942\u20131995'' unpublished 1995</ref> This mapping programme was based on high altitude (40,000 feet) air photography, acquired by the Royal Australian Air Force using [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra bombers]] fitted with Wild RC10 mapping cameras (Operation Skai Piksa), supported by Survey Corps surveyors and photogrammetrists to plan the photography requirements and for quality control to ensure that the photography met the high technical standards for the subsequent mapping processes.\n\nUnder the Defence Cooperation Programme, the Corps completed many cooperative and collaborative projects with nations in Australia's area of strategic interest. These projects included ground surveys, definition of geodetic datums, air photography, assistance with definition of Exclusive Economic Zones, mapping, provision of equipment and technology transfer and training of officers and technicians. Projects commenced in 1970 in Indonesia and expanded over 25 years to include Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tonga, Kiribati, Nauru, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Western Samoa. Technical Advisers were posted to national survey and mapping organisations in Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.<ref name=cc2000 />\n\nAll field survey operations outside of Australia, and indeed in Australia, would not have been possible without essential support of most other Army Corps (Engineers; Signals; Aviation \u2013 Cessna, [[Pilatus PC-6 Porter|Porter]], [[GAF Nomad|Nomad]], [[Bell H-13 Sioux|Sioux]], [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|Kiowa]]; Chaplains, Medical, Dental, Transport, Ordnance, Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, Pay, Catering, Service), the Royal Australian Navy ([[Australian Hydrographic Service|Hydrographic Service]], Landing Craft, Patrol Boats) and at times the Royal New Zealand Navy (Hydrographic Service), the Royal Australian Air Force (Canberra, [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Hercules]], [[de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou|Caribou]], [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|Iroquois]]) and civil charter fixed wing and helicopters for aerial survey work and transport.\n\nTwo members of the Australian Defence Force died on military survey operations in the 1970s in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia and are commemorated on the [[Australian War Memorial]] Roll of Honour.\n\nAssociations with other Armies commenced during the First World War and for more than 50 years after the Second World War the Corps participated in mapping, charting and geodesy projects for standardisation and interoperability with major allies including Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and United States. From the 1960s, the Corps participated in cooperative and collaborative geodetic satellite programs with the United States, firstly astro-triangulation of passive satellites Echo and Pageos being observed with Wild BC4 cameras at [[Thursday Island]] in Queensland, [[Narrabri]] in New South Wales, [[Perth]] in Western Australia and [[Cocos Island]], a TRANET fixed station at [[Smithfield, South Australia|Smithfield]] in South Australia in the global network observing US Navy Navigation Satellites (TRANSIT) from 1976 to 1993 and the first observations of [[Global Positioning System|US Global Positioning System]] (GPS) satellites in Australia, at Smithfield, during the development and early operational phases of the system from 1981 to 1994.<ref name=jensen2011 /> The Corps managed bi-lateral Defence and Army map exchange arrangements with major allies and regional nations. Personnel exchange programs included Canada, United Kingdom and United States.\n\n====Participation in national survey and mapping programmes====\nIn 1945 the National Mapping Council (NMC) of Australia, comprising Commonwealth and State authorities, was formed to coordinate survey and mapping activities after the Second World War. Despite the huge wartime mapping achievements of producing 224 'four-mile' strategic maps and 397 'one-mile' tactical maps, there was much to be done for a basic coverage of reliable topographic maps for national development and defence.<ref name=fitz1980 /> In 1947 a National Mapping Section in the Department of Interior was established and together with the Survey Corps commenced work on the 1954 Cabinet approved general purpose (national development and defence) national topographic map programme, initially the 'four-mile' map then soon after scale 1:250,000 maps (series R502).  Army agreed that when not required for solely military purposes, Survey Corps units would be available to work in the Defence priority areas in the Government approved national geodetic survey and topographic mapping programmes. This programme involved control surveys by astronomical fixes, theodolite and chain triangulation and traverse by theodolite and electro-magnetic distance measurement and all aspects of map compilation from aerial photography, final cartography and map printing.  The Corps' geodetic surveys were integrated with other Commonwealth and State Government surveys to create the NMC sponsored Australian Geodetic Datum 1966 (AGD66) and the associated Australian Map Grid 1966 (AMG66) of Australia and Papua New Guinea and the Australian Height Datum 1971 (AHD71). By 1968 the Corps had completed its commitment of about half of the 540 series R502 maps and it then embarked on the Defence priority part of the 1965 Cabinet endorsed national programme of general purpose scale 1:100,000 topographic maps. This programme required densification of the national geodetic and height survey networks with mapping quality control surveys of Cape York, Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Northern Territory and north-west Western Australia using mainly airborne electromagnetic distance measurement systems (Aerodist). The Corps completed its commitment of 862 of these maps in 1982.\n\nIn areas of higher defence interest the Survey Corps replaced the series R502 1:250,000 maps with the military specification 1:250,000 Joint Operation Graphic (JOG) Ground and the companion Air version using materials from the 1:100,000 and Defence 1:50,000 mapping programmes and from other suitable sources.\n\n====Units and command staff post-Second World War====\n* Army Headquarters Directorate of Survey \u2013 Army\n* Headquarters Field Force Command \u2013 Senior Staff Officer and Survey Section\n* [[Army Survey Regiment]] based at [[Bendigo, Victoria]], formerly AHQ Survey Regiment and Southern Command Field Survey Section, AHQ Cartographic Unit, LHQ Cartographic Company and AHQ Cartographic Company\n* [[1st Field Survey Squadron]] based at Gaythorne and [[Enoggera Barracks]] [[Brisbane]], Qld, formerly Northern Command Field Survey Section and Northern Command Field Survey Unit \u2013 Queensland, Territory Papua and New Guinea\n* [[1st Topographic Survey Squadron]], now part of the [[Royal Australian Engineers]], based at [[Enoggera Barracks]] in [[Brisbane]], formed from 1st Field Survey Squadron and 1st Division Survey Section\n* [[2nd Field Survey Squadron]] based at [[Sydney]], NSW, formerly Eastern Command Field Survey Section and Eastern Command Field Survey Unit \u2013 New South Wales, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, nations of South West Pacific\n* [[4th Field Survey Squadron]] including a Reserve component, based at Keswick Barracks, [[Adelaide]], South Australia, formerly Central Command Field Survey Section and Central Command Field Survey Unit \u2013 South Australia, Northern Territory, Papua and New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu\n* [[5th Field Survey Squadron]] including a Reserve component, based [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], formerly Western Command Field Survey Section and Western Command Field Survey Unit \u2013 Western Australia, Indonesia\n* New Guinea Field Survey Unit\n* [[8th Field Survey Squadron]] raised and disbanded in Papua New Guinea based at Popondetta, Wewak, Port Moresby\n* 1st Topographical Survey Company (CMF) based in Sydney, NSW\n* 2nd Topographical Survey Company (CMF) based in Melbourne, VIC (an element was absorbed by Army Survey Regiment when the company was disbanded)\n* 1st Topographical Survey Troop \u2013 raised and based in Sydney NSW\n* 1st Topographic Survey Troop \u2013 Detachment thereof later re designated A Sect in Vietnam, B Sect based in Sydney, NSW\n* 9th Topographic Survey Troop (CMF) based in Sydney, NSW\n* 7th Military Geographic Information Section based at Darwin, NT\n* ANZUK Survey Map Depot, Singapore \u2013 formerly 16 Field Survey Depot formerly AHQ Field Survey Depot Detachment\n* Army Map Depot, formerly AHQ Field Survey Depot and Army Field Survey Depot \u2013 Victoria\n* School of Military Survey \u2013 initially based at [[Balcombe, Victoria]] and subsequently at [[Bonegilla, Victoria]].

Review outcomes led to many reorganisations. In the late 1980s and early 1990s efficiency reviews led to an Army direction that the non-core strategic mapping functions of the Corps were to be tested as part of the Defence Commercial Support Program. Army decisions as part of that review were that: the combat support survey force (1st Topographical Survey Squadron) would be increased significantly; the non-core work, mainly systematic mapping of Australia would be performed by a new Army agency with civilian personnel; and, that the core strategic mapping would be retained by Army until it could be transferred to Defence Intelligence. This last component was achieved in 2000 when the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation (now [[Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation]]) was formed. These changes meant that the majority of Survey Corps staff positions would be removed, and so in September 1995 the Chief of the General Staff (CGS) decided that the remaining combat support force and training force functions of the Corps would be once again integrated with the combat force and training force of the Royal Australian Engineers.\n\nAt the integration parade of the two Corps on 1 July 1996, 81 years after the formation of the Australian Survey Corps, the CGS said that \"Since 1915 the Survey Corps has not just been a major contributor to the tactical success of the Australian Army in two World Wars and other conflicts, it has played an outstanding role in the building of this nation \u2013 the Commonwealth of Australia \u2013 and the building of other nations such as Papua New Guinea\".\n\nIn 2014 the 1st Topographical Survey Squadron RAE came under the command of the [[1st Intelligence Battalion (Australia)|1st Intelligence Battalion]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Geospatial Intelligence \u2013 extracted from \u2018Australian Sapper\u2019 2014|journal=Royal Australian Survey Corps Association Queensland Branch Bulletin|edition=Christmas Edition \u2013 No 61|url=http://www.rasurvey.org/bulletins/Bulletin%2061%20Dec%2015.pdf|date=December 2015|p=5}}</ref>  In 2018 the Army geospatial capability, less the field surveying capability, was transferred from RAE to Aust Int Corps, 1st Topographical Survey Squadron RAE was transferred to [[Australian Army Intelligence Corps|Australian Intelligence Corps]] and retitled 5 Company 1st Intelligence Battalion and Geomatic Engineering Wing was retitled Geospatial Intelligence Wing and transferred from School of Military Engineering to Defence Force School of Intelligence.\n\n==Corps Appointments and its people==\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth II approved the appointment, on 1 July 1988, of Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales as Colonel-in-Chief of the Royal Australian Survey Corps.<ref name=cc2000 />\n\nColonels Commandant (honorary appointment), Royal Australian Survey Corps:<ref name=cc2000 />\n* Brigadier D.

Lemon (January 1991 \u2013 June 1996)\n\nThe high reputation and esteem in which the Corps was held within the Australian Defence Force, the surveying and mapping profession and amongst Australia's military allies and friends was based on its achievements largely possible only by the quality of its people. This was greatly enhanced by the camaraderie and espirit-de-corps of the members of the Corps, knowing the high military value and high quality of the work that they produced. After World War II eight Corps officers were later appointed Surveyors-General or Directors of Survey/Mapping/Lands in the States or Commonwealth organisations. Many personnel went on to leadership positions in professional institutions. The first five members of the Institution of Surveyors, Australia, recognised for outstanding service to the profession and awarded a special gold medial, had all been officers of the Survey Corps.<ref name=cc2000 />\n\nFrom the 1960s, most Corps officers were tertiary educated with many at the post-graduate level in either mapping or computer disciplines and military command and staff training. This was the key to understanding the potential, application and implementation of emerging technologies and techniques across all aspects of Corps capability. Corps soldier training was both broad within a trade, across Corps trades and specific to specialised equipment with military training for various levels of leadership. Officers and soldiers posted outside Corps positions were highly regarded. Until the 1970s the Corps sponsored and trained soldiers in trades other than the mapping related trades essential to its operations. These included drivers, storemen and clerks. After some rationalisation the Corps retained career and training responsibility for all mapping related trades, and also photographers (non-public relations), illustrators and projectionists who were posted mainly to training institutions and headquarters.\n\nMore than 6,300 people served in the Survey Section (RAE), Australian Survey Corps units and Royal Australian Survey Corps units from 1910 to 1996, including more than 580 women from 1942 to 1996. A Survey Corps Nominal Roll 1915-1996 may be accessed from the front page of the website of the Royal Australian Survey Corps Association linked on External Links below.\n\nThe Corps participated in the national service scheme in the 1950s, training and maintaining two Citizen Military Force topographic survey companies in Sydney and Melbourne from 1951 to 1957, mainly for national servicemen to complete their obligations. National servicemen then served with the Survey Corps in Vietnam from 1966 to 1971.\n\nThe Army Audio Visual Unit was the only Corps unit not to have a mapping related role.\n\n==Equipment, Technology and Techniques==\nRA Svy had the enviable military, international and national reputation of leading innovation, development and implementation of many generations of state-of-the-art technology and techniques across all areas of surveying, mapping and printing, striving to improve efficiencies. Significant examples of these include:<ref name=sargent1990 /><ref name=sms1985 /><ref name=jensen2011 /><ref>Royal Australian Survey Corps Annual Report 1989/90, unpublished</ref><ref>Royal Australian Survey Corps Annual Report 1991/92, unpublished</ref>\n\n* 1910\u20131915: established the standard for the Australian Military Map Series, based on United Kingdom [[Ordnance Survey|Ordnance Survey maps]]; mainly 'one-mile-to-one-inch' maps (known as the 'one-mile' map) produced from field survey sheets 'one-mile-to-two-inches' using [[Plane table|plane-tabling]] and parish plans for position, scale and orientation, final map compilation by ink fair drawing at 'one-mile-to-two-inches' using a polyconic projection and lithographic draughting for colour separation (seven colours) and photographic reduction to 'one-mile-to-one-inch' for printing by the Victorian Government Printer.  The Military Survey sheet numbering system was that of the International Map Congress of 1912.  Standard map sheet extent was 30 min longitude x 15 min latitude. Standard height contour interval was 50 feet.<ref>Topographical Survey of Australia, Report on a Conference Between Surveyors-General of the States and a Representative of the Department of Defence \u2013 held at Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, 19\u201321 November 1929, unpublished</ref>\n* 1914: commenced geodetic triangulation (angles by theodolite, azimuth by astronomy and scale by baselines measured with metal tapes) replacing parish plans as the basis for topographic mapping\n* 1923\u20131927: used [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No 1 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force]] air photography to complement topographic survey by plane-tabling\n* 1930\u20131933: the first map produced from a significant use of air photography for topographic compilation using graphical methods of perspective rectification \u2013 Albury, New South Wales, '1 mile' map.  Work on this map highlighted the disparity between the Victoria and New South Wales state survey triangulation networks.  The grid on this sheet was most likely the first instance of cartographic scribing in Australia, done by Warrant Officer Harry Raisbeck engraving the emulsion of a glass plate negative using one tip of a broken ruling pen for the thicker 10,000 yard grid lines and a steel needle to scribe the 1,000 yard grid. This was 23 years before the first map was fully scribed.<ref name=lines />\n* 1933: adopted Sydney Observatory as the geodetic datum for the eastern states, the Clarke 1858 [[reference ellipsoid]] and a British modified map grid based on the [[Transverse Mercator projection|Transverse Mercator map projection]] with Australian zones. The first map with the British modified grid, for artillery purposes, was Albury '1 mile' although it was on the polyconic projection. This grid system was used for Australian topographic mapping until 1966.\n* 1934: commencement of a geodetic survey triangulation program to connect Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia into one coherent network. All theodolites were Cooke, Troughton and Sims Tavistock 5 1/2 inch reading direct to half-second for first order work and 3 1/2 inch reading direct to one second for second order work.  Baselines of four to six miles in length were placed every 200 to 250 miles and measured with [[invar]] tapes standardised by steel bands and the method of temperature coefficient of electrical resistance of measuring tapes.  This method was first used near [[Millicent, South Australia]] after development by Professor Grant of [[University of Adelaide]], research which was acknowledged as world class science and development.<ref name=vance1940 />\n* 1936: the first map produced on the Transverse Mercator projection and the British modified grid \u2013 Helidon, Queensland 'one-mile'\n* 1936: the first map compiled entirely from overlapping strip of air photography and graphical methods of rectification \u2013 Sale, Victoria 'one-mile'.\n* Second World War: many innovative adaptions of equipment and processes for surveying, aerial photography for topographic compilation, cartography, photo-lithography, various printing methods and battlefield terrain modelling in base and field mobile situations to provide rapid response military survey/mapping support under adverse conditions of extreme heat, cold, high humidity, dust and rain in desert and jungle environments and at times under enemy attack\n* 1952: topographic mapping by multi-projector (Multiplex anaglyph) stereoplotting from overlapping air photography, replacing graphical methods of rectification for map compilation\n* 1953: large format Klimsch Commodore cartographic camera (remained in continuous use until December 1978)\n* 1956: changed to decimal (also known as metric) scale mapping, largely as part of standardisation with allies in the [[South East Asia Treaty Organisation]] and adoption of an improved Australian spheroid of reference for mapping, first map Mildura 1:50,000.

He acknowledged the essential nature of mapping for military operations, the work that the Survey Corps did for conflicts around the world and also for the nation building of Australia. He said \"But it is the active service, the sacrifices and the contributions made by the men and women of the Royal Australian Survey Corps that we commemorate here today. On this 100th anniversary, we pay tribute to those whose skill and passion for surveying became integral to the work of the Australian military. And of course we offer our deepest respects to the 20 men who have given their lives serving with the Survey Corps or as members of the ADF on military survey operations.

The club was founded on 17 June 1925 and took its name from the nearby ruins of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. The club currently compete in the [[Albanian First Division]] and they play their home games at the [[Loni Papu\u00e7iu Stadium]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nDuring the early 1920s, sports activities began being organised in the city of [[Fier]], much like other cities in Albania at the time. Students from the region returning from their studies in larger Albanian cities and abroad had learned about football, which they then played back in Fier, which soon became so popular that almost every neighbourhood in the city had children and adults alike playing football. The first official football game to be held in Fier was organised by the Bashkimi Culturual Society on 17 July 1924, which was played between a selection of players from Fier and neighbouring city [[Vlor\u00eb]]. The following summer in 1925, a group of local students led by [[Namik Resuli]] founded the Shoqeria Sportive Apollonia, which translates in English to the Apollonia Sports Society, taking the name from the nearby ruins of the ancient Illyrian city of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. The club was a multidisciplinary one, ad featured one of the first official football clubs in Fier. In 1927 the club's name was changed to SK Myzeqeja and the following year in 1928 the club became a fully professional one, and along with this re-organised its structure by adding the club's regulations and the board of directors, who would plan every activity and match held by the club.\n\n===1930\u20131945===\nIn 1930, the [[Albanian Football Association]] was established and the first officially recognised competitions were held in the country. The club had entered to compete in a national competition for the first time, and were placed in the inaugural second tier championship along with [[Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr|Shqiponja Gjirokast\u00ebr]], [[KS Lushnja|SK Lushnja]], [[Bes\u00eblidhja Lezh\u00eb|Bardhyli Lezh\u00eb]] and [[Muzaka Berat]]. Before the championship had begun, the club had renamed itself to SK Fier, thus dropping the Apollonia from the name. Muzaka Berat won the first second tier championship and they achieved promotion to the old [[Albanian Superliga|First Division]], with SK Fier, Shqiponja Gjirokast\u00ebr, Bardhyli Lezh\u00eb and SK Lushnja missing out on promotion. There was no Second Division held the following year in 1931, but the competition returned in 1932 and was played in three groups between April and May. SK Fier competed in Group B along with [[KF Erzeni|Erzeni Shijak]], [[Besa Kavaj\u00eb|SK Kavaj\u00eb]], [[KS Lushnja|Kongresi i Lushnj\u00ebs]] and [[Muzaka Berat]], where SK Kavaj\u00eb finished top of the group and progressed to the final stage against [[Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb|SK Vlor\u00eb]], who they beat to win the competition. For the following two seasons SK Fier competed in Group B of the Second Division to no avail as they failed to the reach the final stage of the competition. There were no footballing activities held in 1935, but with their return in 1936, SK Fier did not compete in the Second Division initially. However, due to the financial problems of the original finalist [[SK P\u00ebrmeti|Leka i Madh P\u00ebrmet]] the club was invited by the Albanian Football Association to compete in a rematch tournament, where SK Fier finished in third and last place with 3 points, behind [[KS Lushnja|Kongresi i Lushnj\u00ebs]] who also had 3 points and the winners and the promoted side [[Tomori Berat]] with 5 points. Between 1937 and 1939 there was no Second Division held, and shortly after [[World War II]] broke out which meant that many clubs including SK Fier ceased sporting activities until 1945.\n\n===1945\u20131949===\nFollowing the return of football activities, the club changed its name back to Apollonia Fier and began functioning in 1945 and entered to compete in the top flight for the first time, participating in the [[1945 Albanian Superliga|1945 Albanian Championship]], where they were placed in Group B. The club finished sixth out of seven teams in the group, with 2 wins, 1 draw and 6 losses, earning them a total of 7 points and a goal difference of \u221219 as they conceded 28 goals and only scored 9 in total.<ref name=\"giovanniarmillotta\">{{cite web|url=http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/alba45.html |title=Unofficial Site of Albanian Football since 1913: Season 1945 |publisher=giovanniarmillotta.it|accessdate=12 December 2015}}</ref> They were eventually relegated and as there was no Second Division held at the time the club was reduced to playing friendly games, before successfully joining the [[1948 Albanian Superliga|1948 Albanian Championship]], again in Group B. Their second top flight season proved to be far more successful as they finished in third place out of eight sides, with 7 wins, 5 draws and 2 losses and a total of 19 points, just one point behind group winners [[Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb]].<ref name=\"giovanniarmillotta2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/alba48.html |title=Unofficial Site of Albanian Football since 1913: Season 1948 |publisher=giovanniarmillotta.it|accessdate=12 December 2015}}</ref> However, due to changes in the format of footballing competitions by the Albanian Football Association, in order to employ a western format, the club was unable to play in the 1948\u201349 Albanian Championship as they were placed in the new eight-team Second Division, where they were ranked second behind [[Partizani Tirana B]] before the competition was annulled under Soviet pressure who ordered the reinstatement of the Soviet format.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===1990\u2013present===\nAfter the fall of communism just like in every club in [[Albania]], many players left to continue their career abroad. In 1992, the football branch was separated from the main club and continued as '''KF Apolonia Fier''' under chairman [[Ko\u00e7o Kok\u00ebdhima]]. The club started its revival in 1997 after making some impressive appearances to end in the fifth place. The next season the club would finish in a disappointing seventh place but they managed to reach for the first and only time in their history the final of the [[Albanian Cup]]. The club would face in the final their arch-rivals [[KS Lushnja]]. Apolonia managed to win the game with 1\u20130 and bring home the only cup. After some good years in the [[Albanian Superliga]], the club got relegated in 2002\u201303. Apolonia stayed in the Second Division until their promotion in 2005\u201306 when they finished as runners-up. Romanian [[Silviu Dumitrescu]], who has a lot of experience, was the new coach for the 2006\u201307 season. On 10 October 2006, Dumitrescu resigned and was replaced by [[Dhimit\u00ebr Papu\u00e7iu]]. Even though he started with some good results the club couldn't manage to leave the last place of the table. Papu\u00e7iu was replaced by [[Andrea Marko (footballer)|Andrea Marko]] at the start of 2007. But their Superliga season would be difficult and they would finish bottom of the table. In the next season after a hard-fought championship they managed to get promoted back to the Superliga. This season under manager [[Esad Karishik]] they have managed to establish themselves in the middle of the table. This year KS Apolonia has found a talented player whose name is Aldo Capo.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==Stadium==\n{{main|Loni Papu\u00e7iu Stadium}}\n===New stadium===\nThe president of the [[Albanian Football Association]], [[Armand Duka]] announced on a visit to [[Fier]] on 23 November 2010 that plans are under way to build a new stadium that will be shared by both Apolonia Fier and [[Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb]]. The stadium will seat between 15,000 and 20,000 people, making it the second biggest stadium in Albania behind the new under construction [[Qemal Stafa Stadium]]. The stadium will be located between the two neighbouring cities near the 'Vlor\u00eb Fier Bridge' and is due to be completed by 2013. The shareholders that have taken responsibility in building the new stadium are the Vlor\u00eb Council, Fier Council, Apolonia Fier, [[Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb]] and the [[Albanian Football Association]], who have all promised to invest 20% of the costs each.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportishqiptar.com.al/fieri-dhe-vlora-me-stadium-te-ri-te-perbashket/ |title=Fieri dhe Vlora, me stadium t\u00eb ri t\u00eb p\u00ebrbashk\u00ebt |author=Bujar Rama |language=Albanian |publisher=Sporti Shqiptar |accessdate=24 November 2010 |date=24 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Loni Papu\u00e7iu Stadium===\nThe club's existing stadium [[Loni Papu\u00e7iu Stadium]] reconstructed in 2013, and was completed 7 months later in February 2014 in time for a home fixture against [[Ada Velipoj\u00eb]] on 15 February 2014.

The club was founded on 17 June 1925 and took its name from the nearby ruins of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. The club currently compete in the [[Albanian First Division]] and they play their home games at the [[Loni Papu\u00e7iu Stadium]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nDuring the early 1920s sports activities began being organised in the city of [[Fier]], much like other cities in Albania at the time. Students from the region returning from their studies in larger Albanian cities and abroad had learned about football, which they then played back in Fier, which soon became so popular that almost every neighbourhood in the city had children and adults alike playing football. The first official football game to be held in Fier was organised by the Bashkimi Culturual Society on 17 July 1924, which was played between a selection of players from Fier and neighbouring city [[Vlor\u00eb]]. The following summer in 1925, a group of local students led by [[Namik Resuli]] founded the Shoqeria Sportive Apollonia, which translates in English to the Apollonia Sports Society, taking the name from the nearby ruins of the ancient Illyrian city of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. The club was a multidisciplinary one, ad featured one of the first official football clubs in Fier. In 1927 the club's name was changed to SK Myzeqeja and the following year in 1928 the club became a fully professional one, and along with this re-organised its structure by adding the club's regulations and the board of directors, who would plan every activity and match held by the club.\n\n===1930\u20131945===\nIn 1930 the [[Albanian Football Association]] was established and the first officially recognised competitions were held in the country. The club had entered to compete in a national competition for the first time, and were placed in the inaugural second tier championship along with [[Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr|Shqiponja Gjirokast\u00ebr]], [[KS Lushnja|SK Lushnja]], [[Bes\u00eblidhja Lezh\u00eb|Bardhyli Lezh\u00eb]] and [[Muzaka Berat]]. Before the championship had begun, the club had renamed itself to SK Fier, thus dropping the Apollonia from the name. Muzaka Berat won the first second tier championship and they achieved promotion to the old [[Albanian Superliga|First Division]], with SK Fier, Shqiponja Gjirokast\u00ebr, Bardhyli Lezh\u00eb and SK Lushnja missing out on promotion. There was no Second Division held the following year in 1931, but the competition returned in 1932 and was played in three groups between April and May. SK Fier competed in Group B along with [[KF Erzeni|Erzeni Shijak]], [[Besa Kavaj\u00eb|SK Kavaj\u00eb]], [[KS Lushnja|Kongresi i Lushnj\u00ebs]] and [[Muzaka Berat]], where SK Kavaj\u00eb finished top of the group and progressed to the final stage against [[Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb|SK Vlor\u00eb]], who they beat to win the competition. For the following two seasons SK Fier competed in Group B of the Second Division to no avail as they failed to the reach the final stage of the competition. There were no footballing activities held in 1935, but with their return in 1936, SK Fier did not compete in the Second Division initially. However, due to the financial problems of the original finalist [[SK P\u00ebrmeti|Leka i Madh P\u00ebrmet]] the club was invited by the Albanian Football Association to compete in a rematch tournament, where SK Fier finished in third and last place with 3 points, behind [[KS Lushnja|Kongresi i Lushnj\u00ebs]] who also had 3 points and the winners and the promoted side [[Tomori Berat]] with 5 points. Between 1937 and 1939 there was no Second Division held, and shortly after [[World War II]] broke out which meant that many clubs including SK Fier ceased sporting activities until 1945.\n\n===1945\u20131949===\nFollowing the return of football activities, the club changed its name back to Apollonia Fier and began functioning in 1945 and entered to compete in the top flight for the first time, participating in the [[1945 Albanian Superliga|1945 Albanian Championship]], where they were placed in Group B. The club finished sixth out of seven teams in the group, with 2 wins, 1 draw and 6 losses, earning them a total of 7 points and a goal difference of \u221219 as they conceded 28 goals and only scored 9 in total.<ref name=\"giovanniarmillotta\">{{cite web|url=http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/alba45.html |title=Unofficial Site of Albanian Football since 1913: Season 1945 |publisher=giovanniarmillotta.it|accessdate=12 December 2015}}</ref> They were eventually relegated and as there was no Second Division held at the time the club was reduced to playing friendly games, before successfully joining the [[1948 Albanian Superliga|1948 Albanian Championship]], again in Group B. Their second top flight season proved to be far more successful as they finished in third place out of eight sides, with 7 wins, 5 draws and 2 losses and a total of 19 points, just one point behind group winners [[Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb]].<ref name=\"giovanniarmillotta2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.giovanniarmillotta.it/albania/calcio/alba48.html |title=Unofficial Site of Albanian Football since 1913: Season 1948 |publisher=giovanniarmillotta.it|accessdate=12 December 2015}}</ref> However, due to changes in the format of footballing competitions by the Albanian Football Association, in order to employ a western format, the club was unable to play in the 1948\u201349 Albanian Championship as they were placed in the new eight-team Second Division, where they were ranked second behind [[Partizani Tirana B]] before the competition was annulled under Soviet pressure who ordered the reinstatement of the Soviet format.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===1990\u2013present===\nAfter the fall of communism just like in every club in [[Albania]] many players left to continue their career abroad. In 1992 the football branch was separated from the main club and continued as '''KF Apolonia Fier''' under chairman [[Ko\u00e7o Kok\u00ebdhima]]. The club started its revival in 1997 after making some impressive appearances to end in the fifth place. The next season the club would finish in a disappointing seventh place but they managed to reach for the first and only time in their history the final of the [[Albanian Cup]]. The club would face in the final their arch-rivals [[KS Lushnja]]. Apolonia managed to win the game with 1\u20130 and bring home the only cup. After some good years in the [[Albanian Superliga]], the club got relegated in 2002\u201303. Apolonia stayed in the Second Division until their promotion in 2005\u201306 when they finished as runners-up. Romanian [[Silviu Dumitrescu]], who has a lot of experience, was the new coach for the 2006\u201307 season. On 10 October 2006, Dumitrescu resigned and was replaced by [[Dhimit\u00ebr Papu\u00e7iu]]. Even though he started with some good results the club couldn't manage to leave the last place of the table. Papu\u00e7iu was replaced by [[Andrea Marko (footballer)|Andrea Marko]] at the start of 2007. But their Superliga season would be difficult and they would finish bottom of the table. In the next season after a hard-fought championship they managed to get promoted back to the Superliga. This season under manager [[Esad Karishik]] they have managed to establish themselves in the middle of the table. This year KS Apolonia has found a talented player whose name is Aldo Capo.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==Stadium==\n{{main|Loni Papu\u00e7iu Stadium}}\n===New stadium===\nThe president of the [[Albanian Football Association]], [[Armand Duka]] announced on a visit to [[Fier]] on 23 November 2010 that plans are under way to build a new stadium that will be shared by both Apolonia Fier and [[Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb]]. The stadium will seat between 15,000 and 20,000 people, making it the second biggest stadium in Albania behind the new under construction [[Qemal Stafa Stadium]]. The stadium will be located between the two neighbouring cities near the 'Vlor\u00eb Fier Bridge' and is due to be completed by 2013. The shareholders that have taken responsibility in building the new stadium are the Vlor\u00eb Council, Fier Council, Apolonia Fier, [[Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb]] and the [[Albanian Football Association]], who have all promised to invest 20% of the costs each.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportishqiptar.com.al/fieri-dhe-vlora-me-stadium-te-ri-te-perbashket/ |title=Fieri dhe Vlora, me stadium t\u00eb ri t\u00eb p\u00ebrbashk\u00ebt |author=Bujar Rama |language=Albanian |publisher=Sporti Shqiptar |accessdate=24 November 2010 |date=24 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Loni Papu\u00e7iu Stadium===\nThe club's existing stadium [[Loni Papu\u00e7iu Stadium]] reconstructed in 2013, and was completed 7 months later in February 2014 in time for a home fixture against [[Ada Velipoj\u00eb]] on 15 February 2014.

The rivalry between the two clubs became more tense when in 1998 the two clus faced each other in the final of the [[Albanian Cup]]. Other rivals include [[KS Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb|Flamurtari]], [[KF \u00c7lirimi]] second team of Fieri and [[KS Bylis Ballsh]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==Colours and badge==\nThe club's name comes from the nearby ancient city of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]]. In the badge are shown the antic ruins of the city in a red background. The club's traditional colours are white and green and this is the reason why they are usually referred to as \"Bardhegjelberit\" (English:\"White and Green\").\n\n==Achievements==\n;'''[[Albanian First Division]]'''\n*'''Winners (4)''': 1966\u201367, 1971\u201372, 1978\u201379, 1984\u201385\n\n;'''[[Albanian Cup]]'''\n*'''Winners (1)''': 1997\u201398\n\n;'''[[Albanian Supercup]]'''\n*Runners-up (1): 1998\n\n;'''Gazeta Bashkimi Cup'''\n*'''Winners (2)''': 1985, 1988\n\n==KS Apolonia in Europe==\n''As of December 2008''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Descended from Irish immigrants, the family lived in [[Westport, New Zealand|Westport]], on the coast of the [[South Island]].{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=11}} He attended St Canices School in Westport until 1930, when the family moved to [[Wanganui]] and established a home at 43 Plymouth Street. Deere attended Marist Brothers' School and then [[Wanganui Technical College]], becoming an accomplished athlete in [[rugby union|rugby]], [[cricket]] and [[boxing]]. He was so proficient at the latter sport that he represented Wanganui at the New Zealand Boxing Championship. He was also successful academically.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=12\u201313}} \n\nWhen Charles Kingsford-Smith visited Wanganui in the Southern Cross, he offered paid flights in his aircraft; Deere was one who took up the offer and from then on, he became interested in learning how to fly. After finishing his schooling, Deere worked on a sheep farm before taking up employment as a law clerk. In 1936, through his family doctor, he discovered that the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was open to applications from men from the Dominions, reinvigorating his desire to fly. With his father not approving of his intention to join the RAF, he persuaded his mother to sign the necessary application form. He passed the selection board, presided over by Wing Commander [[Ralph Cochrane]], in April 1937 and sailed for England on the ''Rangitane'' in September.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=14}}{{sfn|Claasen|2012|p=23}}\n\n==Military career==\nArriving in London in October 1937, Deere began his flight training at the end of that month at the [[No. 13 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School RAF|No. 13 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School]] at [[White Waltham Airfield|White Waltham]]. Prior to starting he underwent a medical check, which he failed on account of high blood pressure. He had undertake further tests which he passed, the previously high blood pressure readings being put down to over excitement at the prospect of flying.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=16}}\n\nDeere soloed on a Tiger Moth in November and early the following year he was granted a short service commission as an [[Pilot Officer|acting pilot officer]] on probation.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=16}}<ref>{{London Gazette |date=25 January 1938 |issue=34476 |page=517}}</ref> He then commenced initial officer training at [[RAF Uxbridge]] for two weeks before, on 21 January 1938, proceeding to [[No. 6 Flying Training School RAF|No. 6 Flying Training School]] at [[Netheravon Airfield|Netheravon]] in [[Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=17}} His prowess at boxing saw Deere selected for the RAF boxing team to tour South Africa, but flight training took priority. The aircraft he was to have travelled in crashed at [[Bulawayo]] with the loss of several of the RAF personnel on board.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=17}}\n\nIn May 1938, Deere was awarded his wings. He progressed to flying the [[Hawker Fury]], a [[biplane]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] before being posted to [[No. 54 Squadron RAF|No. 54 Squadron]] three months later.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=18}} His new squadron, which was based at [[RAF Hornchurch|Hornchurch]] in Essex, flew [[Gloster Gladiator]]s. However, as the entire squadron was on leave at the time of his arrival, for two weeks he was temporarily attached to No. 74 Squadron, which also flew out of Hornchurch. He was assigned to the section commanded by [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Sailor Malan]], who arranged for him to have some flying time on a [[Gloster Gauntlet]]. When Deere began service with No. 54 Squadron he initially performed administrative duties and it was some time before he was given the opportunity to fly his own Gladiator. Much of the squadron's training in peacetime involved formation flying and fighter tactics{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=19\u201320}} but Deere also played rugby for [[Rosslyn Park F.C.|Rosslyn Park]], a South London club. Opponents included [[London Welsh RFC|London Welsh]] and [[Old Blues RFC]].{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=21}} His rank as a pilot officer was made substantive on 28 October 1938.<ref>{{London Gazette |date=1 November 1938 |issue=34566 |pages=6819\u20136820  |nolink=yes}}</ref>\n\nNo. 54 Squadron began converting to [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s in early 1939, Deere flying his for the first time on 6 March.{{Sfn|Smith|2003|p=22}} Although he enjoyed flying Gladiators, he found the Spitfire to be \"marvellous\". At one point, as he familiarised himself with the aeroplane, he blacked as he was climbing at 27,000 feet. When he recovered he found he was diving the Spitfire towards the sea. Pulling out of the dive, he returned to Hornchurch and sought medical attention. It was found that he had burst one of his eardrums by neglecting to increase his flow of oxygen as he increased his altitude. He was unable to fly until he recovered.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=23}}{{sfn|Wynn|1981|p=107}}\n\n==Second World War==\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War, No. 54 Squadron began flying convoy patrols and missions aimed at intercepting German reconnaissance aircraft.{{sfn|Wynn|1981|p=107}} They occasionally flew night patrols, which were not popular with pilots as the Spitfire was ill equipped for this role. On one such patrol Deere, directed by a controller, very nearly flew into a set of [[Barrage balloon|barrage balloons]] over [[Harwich]] and then ran into a perimeter fence when landing at a foggy Hornchurch.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=25\u201326}} The squadron regularly swapped between operating from Hornchurch and [[RAF Rochford|Rochford]] for the next several months up until May 1940.{{sfn|Wynn|1981|p=107}}\n\n===Battle of France===\nThe [[Battle of France]] had commenced on 10 May 1940 and saw the gradual retreat of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to the French coast at [[Dunkirk]] and [[Calais]]. With the British squadrons already operating in France struggling to cope, from 16 May, No. 54 Squadron began to provide extra air cover over the Allied positions there. Deere was involved with the first, uneventful, patrol, and over the coming days flew several more such patrols to Dunkirk.{{sfn|Wynn|1981|p=107}}{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=27}}\n\nOn 23 May Deere and another pilot were detailed to escort Flight Lieutenant James Leathart, flying a [[Miles Magister]], across the [[English Channel]] to rescue No. 74 Squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader White, who had made a forced landing at an airfield at Calais. During this mission, and in sight of Leathart, Deere claimed his first combat victories, shooting down two of several [[Messerschmitt Me 109]]s that had approached while the Magister was still on the airfield. He damaged a third Me 109 but ran out of ammunition and had to return to England. The mission was a success for Leathart was able to collect White and return to Hornchurch.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=28\u201329}}{{sfn|Thompson|1953|p=61}} The action gave Deere an insight into the qualities of the Me 109; he considered that \"in the hands of a good pilot was a tough nut to crack. Initially, it was faster in the dive, but slower in the climb; the Spitfire could out-turn but it was at a disadvantage in manoeuvres that entailed negative G forces. Overall, there was little to choose between the two fighters.\"{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=30}}\n\nThe following day, while the squadron was flying near [[Saint-Omer]] in the Calais region, a formation of [[Heinkel He 111]]s bombers accompanied by [[Messerschmitt Me 110]]s and Me 109s was spotted. An attempt to attack the bombers was disrupted by the Me 109s. During the resulting melee, Deere shot down a Me 109.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=30\u201331}} On 26 May, with the squadron at 17,000 feet over Gravelines covering a convoy of ammunition ships, he shot down two Me 110s. These had disrupted his attempt to intercept some German bombers that were attacking a British destroyer off Calais. His aircraft was badly damaged during this action, with part of one wing shot away.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=32}}{{sfn|Thompson|1953|p=62}}\n\n[[Operation Dynamo]], the British effort to evacuate the BEF from Dunkirk, commenced in the evening of 26 May. The RAF efforts now shifted to tightly covering Dunkirk and the English Channel, protecting the ships of the evacuation fleet as much as possible.{{sfn|Thompson|1953|p=62}} Accordingly, No. 54 Squadron would fly several times a day to Dunkirk during the evacuation. On an afternoon patrol on 27 May, Deere destroyed a [[Junkers Ju 88]] attacking a hospital ship, and shared in the destruction of another.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=33}} The next day, Deere led the squadron, now down to eight serviceable  aircraft, on its final dawn patrol before it was withdrawn for a rest. Coming across a [[Dornier Do 17]], he led a section of his flight in pursuit while the rest the squadron continued with its patrol. In making an attack on the Dornier, his own Spitfire was damaged by machine-gun fire from its rear gunner. This forced him to make an emergency landing on a Belgian beach, during which he was knocked unconscious. After coming to, he made his way on foot to Oost-Duinkerke where his head injuries were dressed. He hitched a ride on a British Army lorry to Dunkirk, and boarded a boat to [[Dover]] from where he took a train back to London, and then travelled to Hornchurch, from where he had taken off some 19 hours earlier. During his boat ride to Dover, he was subject to scathing comments from soldiers about the effectiveness of the RAF's fighter cover.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfn|Wynn|1981|pp=108\u2013109}} \n\n[[File:Royal Air Force Fighter Command, 1939-1945. CH430.jpg|thumb|right|Deere being presented with his DFC by King George VI, 27 June 1940]]\nFor its rest, No. 54 Squadron had moved to the RAF's base at [[RAF Catterick|Catterick]] in [[Yorkshire]]. Afer ten days of non-stop flying over Dunkirk, it had been depleted in both pilots and aircraft and needed to rest and re-equip. It returned to Hornchurch on 4 June 1940, with new Spitfires and replacement pilots, and began flying reconnaissance missions to northern France and Belgium. On one such mission in the [[Abbeville]] area, Deere and Leathart between them badly damaged a Junkers Ju 88, counting it as a probable. Later in the month Deere's award of the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) was announced and this was presented to him by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] at a ceremony at Hornchurch on 27 June.{{sfn|Wynn|1981|p=109}}{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=36\u201338}} His citation for the DFC read:\n{{Quote|During May 1940, this officer has, in company with his squadron, taken part in numerous offensive patrols over Northern France, and has been engaged in seven combats often against superior numbers of the enemy. In the course of these engagements he has personally shot down five enemy aircraft and assisted in the destruction of others. On one occasion, in company with a second aircraft, he escorted a trainer aircraft to Calais Marck aerodrome, for the purpose of rescuing a squadron commander who had been shot down there. The trainer aircraft was attacked by twelve Messerschmitt 109's whilst taking off at Calais, but Pilot Officer Deere, with the other pilot, immediately attacked, with the result that three enemy aircraft were shot down, and a further three severely damaged. Throughout these engagements this officer has displayed courage and determination in his attacks on the enemy.|''[[London Gazette]]'', No. 34873, 14 June 1940.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34873|date=14 June 1940|page=3622}}</ref>}}\n\nBy July, No. 54 Squadron was back to flying convoy and coastal patrols.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}} In the afternoon of 9 July while leading a patrol between Deal and Dover, a [[Heinkel He 59]] seaplane was sighted along with an escort of several Me 109s. Ordering one section to pursue the seaplane, Deere took another section to deal with the escort. He shot down one Me 109 but then collided with a second, flown by [[Oberfeldwebel]] Johann Illner of ''[[Jagdgeschwader 51]]''. As a result of the glancing blow with the Me 109, the propeller blades of Deere's Spitfire were bent backwards, his cockpit hood partially stove in, the engine disabled, and much of the fin and rudder lost. Already heading inland prior to the collision, he managed to glided to a forced landing in a paddock near [[Manston, Kent|Manston]]. The hood, damaged in the collision, provided difficult to open but he was able to escape before his burning aircraft was destroyed by flames. He spent the night at the nearby RAF airbase before returning to Hornchurch the next day. In the meantime, Illner was able to return to France in his own badly damaged aircraft.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=40\u201341}}{{sfn|Claasen|2012|pp=51\u201352}}  \n\n===Battle of Britain===\nThe first phase of the [[Battle of Britain]] commenced on 10 July 1940, when German attacks on targets along the coast of England and on shipping were stepped up in the [[Kanalkampf]] (Channel war). These were designed to draw out and destroy [[RAF Fighter Command]], necessary for the proposed [[Operation Sea Lion|invasion of Britain]].{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}}{{sfn|Claasen|2012|p=50}}{{sfn|Thompson|1953|pp=76\u201377}} As part of [[No. 11 Group RAF|No. 11 Group]], tasked with the defence of southeast England, Deere's squadron was to be heavily involved in the Battle of Britain.{{sfn|Thompson|1953|p=87}}{{sfn|Claasen|2012|p=140}}\n\nPoor weather conditions meant that No. 54 Squadron saw little action until 24 July, when the Luftwaffe mounted several large bombing raids against convoys in the Thames estuary. With one raid in the morning having been disrupted by Deere and his flight, during a second raid at midday that included at least 20 bombers and 30 fighters, he destroyed a Me 109.{{sfn|Thompson|1953|p=78}}{{sfn|Claasen|2012|pp=63\u201364}} This was his first victory of the Battle of Britain{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=42}} and by the end of the action, the squadron had accounted for 16 Me 109s for the loss of two pilots.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=43\u201344}} A few days later, Deere was promoted to the rank of [[flying officer]]<ref>{{London Gazette|date=3 September 1940|issue=34937|pages=5343\u20135344|nolink=yes}}</ref> and the squadron, having flown more sorties than any other during July, was sent back to Cattrick for a rest.{{sfn|Claasen|2012|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nNo. 54 Squadron returned to Hornchurch on 8 August 1940 and flew an uneventful patrol later that day.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=44}} On 12 August, Deere, while leading the squadron, pursued and shot down a Me 109 that broke up his section's attack on a group of bombers off the coast near North Foreland. While returning to Hornchurch, he encountered a group of Me 110s, one of which he shot down.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=45}} On 15 August, during an attempt by the squadron to intercept a bombing raid but encountered 40 Me 109s. Deere destroyed one and damaged another. On another interception mission that evening, the squadron engaged a group of Me 109s escorting Dornier Do 17 bombers flying towards London. He pursued one Me 109 and shot it down over the English Channel. A second was also destroyed, Deere having pursued it inland of the French coast. Heading back to England, he encountered five Me 109s which attempted to block his flight path. He was able to make the English coast but his Spitfire had taken damage from the Me 109s before they broke away. He was forced to bail out at low altitude; as he exited the cockpit, he struck the tailplane which injured his wrist. Initially taken to [[RAF Kenley]], at which time he discovered his watch had been damaged by a German bullet, he was admitted to [[Queen Victoria Hospital|Victoria Hospital]] for treatment.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=46\u201348}} He discharged himself the following day and was back on operations on 17 August.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=49}} Deere was shot down again on 28 August, this time by a Spitfire in an incidence of [[friendly fire]], but parachuted to safety. He had earlier destroyed a Me 109, but not being able to see it crash and thus only claimed it as a probable.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=55}} His abandoned Spitfire went on to crash at Boreham and in 1973, its engine and other remnants were recovered. On 30 August, a quieter day for the squadron with only two patrols, he engaged a Dornier Do 17 which he again, not being able to physically confirm its destruction, claimed as a probable.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=56}}\n\nThe following day the Luftwaffe raided Hornchurch, which had been caught unawares. The squadron was scrambled, with Deere leading a section of three Spitfires as they taxied down the runway. The German bombers in the meantime released their munitions onto the runway. All three aeroplanes of Deere's section were destroyed with his Spitfire was blown on its back, trapping him. With injuries to his scalp, he was extracted by another pilot of his section. He ignored instructions to return to duty on 2 September,{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=59}} flying a patrol a day earlier.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=57\u201358}} He only had two more days of operations for the squadron and moved back to Catterick for yet another period of rest and recovery{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=59}} and would play no further role in the Battle of Britain.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=62}} Since the beginning of 1940, its pilot had accounted for the destruction of at least 92 enemy aircraft.{{sfn|Claasen|2012|p=140}}\n\nShortly after the squadron's return to Yorkshire, Deere's award of a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his DFC was announced. The published citation read:\n{{Quote|Since the outbreak of war this officer has personally destroyed eleven, and probably one other, enemy aircraft, and assisted in the destruction of two more. In addition to the skill and gallantry he has shown in leading his flight, and in many instances his squadron, Flight Lieutenant Deere has displayed conspicuous bravery and determination in pressing home his attacks against superior numbers of enemy aircraft, often pursuing them across the Channel in order to shoot them down. As a leader he shows outstanding dash and determination.|''London Gazette'', No. 34940, 6 September 1940.<ref>{{London Gazette |date=6 September 1940 |issue=34940 |page=5407 |nolink=yes}}</ref>}}\n\n===Squadron Leader, America===\nNo. 54 Squadron remained in Yorkshire for the remainder of 1940, classified as a training unit.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=61\u201362}} Deere was one of a few pilots to remain as an instructor with most of the experienced aircrew being posted to other squadrons.{{Sfn|Wynn|1981|p=112}} Consequently, he was involved in practice flights with new pilots, bringing them up to speed with combat tactics. On one such flight in December 1940, he collided with a trainee's aircraft, which saw his Spitfire losing most of its tail and going into a spin. Bailing out with some difficulty due to the centrifugal forces of the spinning aircraft, he became trapped against the remnants of the tail fin. He was finally able to break free as the Spitfire approached the ground, but his parachute, which had been damaged, failed to fully open. Deere landed in a pool of farm sewerage which broke much of his fall. As a result of this incident he was rested from active flying.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=62\u201363}}\n\nIn January 1941 Deere was promoted to acting squadron leader and tasked as an operations room controller at Catterick. Due to weather conditions, flying was limited and No. 54 Squadron shifted back to Hornchurch in February. The squadron's role was now to conduct offensive sweeps, codenamed Rhubarbs, over France.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=66\u201367}} Deere soon tired of his controller duties and sought a return to flying operations. In May 1941, he was posted to [[No. 602 Squadron RAF|No. 602 Squadron]], which operated Spitfires from [[RAF Ayr|Ayr]], as one of its [[flight commander]]s. This move saw him return to the rank of flight lieutenant.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=68\u201369}} \n\nWhen Deere arrived at No. 602 Squadron, he was already well known for his reputation both as a fighter ace and narrow escapes.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=69}} On an early practice flight over the [[North Sea]] with the squadron, his Spitfire developed engine trouble. He only just made the Scottish coast and crash landed in a potato field, flipping his aircraft onto its back, temporarily trapping him. He was able to wriggle free and make his way back to Ayr.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=70\u201371}} At the end of July he took over as Officer Commanding No. 602 Squadron, and on 1 August it moved back to [[RAF Kenley]]. On the same day he shot down another Bf 109.\n\nHe was promoted to the [[war substantive]] rank of [[flight lieutenant]] on 28 July 1941,<ref>{{London Gazette |date=15 August 1941 |issue=35247 |page=4726 |nolink=yes}}</ref> and to the permanent rank on 28 October 1941.<ref>{{London Gazette |date=12 May 1944 |supp=y |issue=36514 |page=2230 |nolink=yes}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1942 he was sent on a lecturing and public relations trip to America teaching American pilots fighter tactics learnt in the Battle of Britain.\n\n===Biggin Hill wing leader===\n[[File:Dowding and The Few.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Deere with fellow Battle of Britain pilots at a reunion in London in September 1942.

In August he went on a course at RAF Staff College and was subsequently posted to Headquarters [[No. 13 Group RAF|No. 13 Group]] on staff duties.\n\nHe engineered a return to operations, somewhat unofficially, as a supernumerary with [[No. 611 Squadron RAF|No. 611 Squadron]] at [[RAF Biggin Hill]]. He shot down an [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]] soon after, but wrote of his great respect for the type and its pilots.\n\nHe was given command of the Kenley fighter wing, but this was changed at the last minute to keep him as [[wing leader]] at Biggin Hill. While there, Deere was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the citation reading: \n<blockquote>This officer has displayed exceptional qualities of skill which have played a large part in the successes of formations he has led.

Descended from Irish immigrants, the family lived in [[Westport, New Zealand|Westport]], on the coast of the [[South Island]].{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=11}} He attended St Canices School in Westport until 1930, when the family moved to [[Wanganui]] and established a home at 43 Plymouth Street. Deere attended Marist Brothers' School and then [[Wanganui Technical College]], becoming an accomplished athlete in [[rugby union|rugby]], [[cricket]] and [[boxing]]. He was so proficient at the latter sport that he represented Wanganui at the New Zealand Boxing Championship. He was also successful academically.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=12\u201313}} \n\nWhen Charles Kingsford-Smith visited Wanganui in the Southern Cross, he offered paid flights in his aircraft; Deere was one who took up the offer and from then on, he became interested in learning how to fly. After finishing his schooling, Deere worked on a sheep farm before taking up employment as a law clerk. In 1936, through his family doctor, he discovered that the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was open to applications from men from the Dominions, reinvigorating his desire to fly. With his father not approving of his intention to join the RAF, he persuaded his mother to sign the necessary application form. He passed the selection board, presided over by Wing Commander [[Ralph Cochrane]], in April 1937 and sailed for England on the ''Rangitane'' in September.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=14}}{{sfn|Claasen|2012|p=23}}\n\n==Military career==\nArriving in London in October 1937, Deere began his flight training at the end of that month at the [[No. 13 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School RAF|No. 13 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School]] at [[White Waltham Airfield|White Waltham]]. Prior to starting he underwent a medical check, which he failed on account of high blood pressure. He had undertake further tests which he passed, the previously high blood pressure readings being put down to over excitement at the prospect of flying.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=16}}\n\nDeere soloed on a Tiger Moth in November and early the following year he was granted a short service commission as an [[Pilot Officer|acting pilot officer]] on probation.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=16}}<ref>{{London Gazette |date=25 January 1938 |issue=34476 |page=517}}</ref> He then commenced initial officer training at [[RAF Uxbridge]] for two weeks before, on 21 January 1938, proceeding to [[No. 6 Flying Training School RAF|No. 6 Flying Training School]] at [[Netheravon Airfield|Netheravon]] in [[Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=17}} His prowess at boxing saw Deere selected for the RAF boxing team to tour South Africa, but flight training took priority. The aircraft he was to have travelled in crashed at [[Bulawayo]] with the loss of several of the RAF personnel on board.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=17}}\n\nIn May 1938, Deere was awarded his wings. He progressed to flying the [[Hawker Fury]], a [[biplane]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] before being posted to [[No. 54 Squadron RAF|No. 54 Squadron]] three months later.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=18}} His new squadron, which was based at [[RAF Hornchurch|Hornchurch]] in Essex, flew [[Gloster Gladiator]]s. However, as the entire squadron was on leave at the time of his arrival, for two weeks he was temporarily attached to No. 74 Squadron, which also flew out of Hornchurch. He was assigned to the section commanded by [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[Sailor Malan]], who arranged for him to have some flying time on a [[Gloster Gauntlet]]. When Deere began service with No. 54 Squadron he initially performed administrative duties and it was some time before he was given the opportunity to fly his own Gladiator. Much of the squadron's training in peacetime involved formation flying and fighter tactics{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=19\u201320}} but Deere also played rugby for [[Rosslyn Park F.C.|Rosslyn Park]], a South London club. Opponents included [[London Welsh RFC|London Welsh]] and [[Old Blues RFC]].{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=21}} His rank as a pilot officer was made substantive on 28 October 1938.<ref>{{London Gazette |date=1 November 1938 |issue=34566 |pages=6819\u20136820  |nolink=yes}}</ref>\n\nNo. 54 Squadron began converting to [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s in early 1939, Deere flying his for the first time on 6 March.{{Sfn|Smith|2003|p=22}} Although he enjoyed flying Gladiators, he found the Spitfire to be \"marvellous\". At one point, as he familiarised himself with the aeroplane, he blacked as he was climbing at 27,000 feet. When he recovered he found he was diving the Spitfire towards the sea. Pulling out of the dive, he returned to Hornchurch and sought medical attention. It was found that he had burst one of his eardrums by neglecting to increase his flow of oxygen as he increased his altitude. He was unable to fly until he recovered.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=23}}{{sfn|Wynn|1981|p=107}}\n\n==Second World War==\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War, No. 54 Squadron began flying convoy patrols and missions aimed at intercepting German reconnaissance aircraft.{{sfn|Wynn|1981|p=107}} They occasionally flew night patrols, which were not popular with pilots as the Spitfire was ill equipped for this role. On one such patrol Deere, directed by a controller, very nearly flew into a set of [[Barrage balloon|barrage balloons]] over [[Harwich]] and then ran into a perimeter fence when landing at a foggy Hornchurch.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=25\u201326}} The squadron regularly swapped between operating from Hornchurch and [[RAF Rochford|Rochford]] for the next several months up until May 1940.{{sfn|Wynn|1981|p=107}}\n\n===Battle of France===\nThe [[Battle of France]] had commenced on 10 May 1940 and saw the gradual retreat of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to the French coast at [[Dunkirk]] and [[Calais]]. With the British squadrons already operating in France struggling to cope, from 16 May, No. 54 Squadron began to provide extra air cover over the Allied positions there. Deere was involved with the first, uneventful, patrol, and over the coming days flew several more such patrols to Dunkirk.{{sfn|Wynn|1981|p=107}}{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=27}}\n\nOn 23 May Deere and another pilot were detailed to escort Flight Lieutenant James Leathart, flying a [[Miles Magister]], across the [[English Channel]] to rescue No. 74 Squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader White, who had made a forced landing at an airfield at Calais. During this mission, and in sight of Leathart, Deere claimed his first combat victories, shooting down two of several [[Messerschmitt Me 109]]s that had approached while the Magister was still on the airfield. He damaged a third Me 109 but ran out of ammunition and had to return to England. The mission was a success for Leathart was able to collect White and return to Hornchurch.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=28\u201329}}{{sfn|Thompson|1953|p=61}} The action gave Deere an insight into the qualities of the Me 109; he considered that \"in the hands of a good pilot was a tough nut to crack. Initially, it was faster in the dive, but slower in the climb; the Spitfire could out-turn but it was at a disadvantage in manoeuvres that entailed negative G forces. Overall, there was little to choose between the two fighters.\"{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=30}}\n\nThe following day, while the squadron was flying near [[Saint-Omer]] in the Calais region, a formation of [[Heinkel He 111]]s bombers accompanied by [[Messerschmitt Me 110]]s and Me 109s was spotted. An attempt to attack the bombers was disrupted by the Me 109s. During the resulting melee, Deere shot down a Me 109.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=30\u201331}} On 26 May, with the squadron at 17,000 feet over Gravelines covering a convoy of ammunition ships, he shot down two Me 110s. These had disrupted his attempt to intercept some German bombers that were attacking a British destroyer off Calais. His aircraft was badly damaged during this action, with part of one wing shot away.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=32}}{{sfn|Thompson|1953|p=62}}\n\n[[Operation Dynamo]], the British effort to evacuate the BEF from Dunkirk, commenced in the evening of 26 May. The RAF efforts now shifted to tightly covering Dunkirk and the English Channel, protecting the ships of the evacuation fleet as much as possible.{{sfn|Thompson|1953|p=62}} Accordingly, No. 54 Squadron would fly several times a day to Dunkirk during the evacuation. On an afternoon patrol on 27 May, Deere destroyed a [[Junkers Ju 88]] attacking a hospital ship, and shared in the destruction of another.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=33}} The next day, Deere led the squadron, now down to eight serviceable  aircraft, on its final dawn patrol before it was withdrawn for a rest. Coming across a [[Dornier Do 17]], he led a section of his flight in pursuit while the rest the squadron continued with its patrol. In making an attack on the Dornier, his own Spitfire was damaged by machine-gun fire from its rear gunner. This forced him to make an emergency landing on a Belgian beach, during which he was knocked unconscious. After coming to, he made his way on foot to Oost-Duinkerke where his head injuries were dressed. He hitched a ride on a British Army lorry to Dunkirk, and boarded a boat to [[Dover]] from where he took a train back to London, and then travelled to Hornchurch, from where he had taken off some 19 hours earlier. During his boat ride to Dover, he was subject to scathing comments from soldiers about the effectiveness of the RAF's fighter cover.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfn|Wynn|1981|pp=108\u2013109}} \n\n[[File:Royal Air Force Fighter Command, 1939-1945. CH430.jpg|thumb|right|Deere being presented with his DFC by King George VI, 27 June 1940]]\nFor its rest, No. 54 Squadron had moved to the RAF's base at [[RAF Catterick|Catterick]] in [[Yorkshire]]. Afer ten days of non-stop flying over Dunkirk, it had been depleted in both pilots and aircraft and needed to rest and re-equip. It returned to Hornchurch on 4 June 1940, with new Spitfires and replacement pilots, and began flying reconnaissance missions to northern France and Belgium. On one such mission in the [[Abbeville]] area, Deere and Leathart between them badly damaged a Junkers Ju 88, counting it as a probable. Later in the month Deere's award of the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] (DFC) was announced and this was presented to him by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] at a ceremony at Hornchurch on 27 June.{{sfn|Wynn|1981|p=109}}{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=36\u201338}} His citation for the DFC read:\n{{Quote|During May 1940, this officer has, in company with his squadron, taken part in numerous offensive patrols over Northern France, and has been engaged in seven combats often against superior numbers of the enemy. In the course of these engagements he has personally shot down five enemy aircraft and assisted in the destruction of others. On one occasion, in company with a second aircraft, he escorted a trainer aircraft to Calais Marck aerodrome, for the purpose of rescuing a squadron commander who had been shot down there. The trainer aircraft was attacked by twelve Messerschmitt 109's whilst taking off at Calais, but Pilot Officer Deere, with the other pilot, immediately attacked, with the result that three enemy aircraft were shot down, and a further three severely damaged. Throughout these engagements this officer has displayed courage and determination in his attacks on the enemy.|''[[London Gazette]]'', No. 34873, 14 June 1940.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34873|date=14 June 1940|page=3622}}</ref>}}\n\nBy July, No. 54 Squadron was back to flying convoy and coastal patrols.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}} In the afternoon of 9 July while leading a patrol between Deal and Dover, a [[Heinkel He 59]] seaplane was sighted along with an escort of several Me 109s. Ordering one section to pursue the seaplane, Deere took another section to deal with the escort. He shot down one Me 109 but then collided with a second, flown by [[Oberfeldwebel]] Johann Illner of ''[[Jagdgeschwader 51]]''. As a result of the glancing blow with the Me 109, the propeller blades of Deere's Spitfire were bent backwards, his cockpit hood partially stove in, the engine disabled, and much of the fin and rudder lost. Already heading inland prior to the collision, he managed to glided to a forced landing in a paddock near [[Manston, Kent|Manston]]. The hood, damaged in the collision, provided difficult to open but he was able to escape before his burning aircraft was destroyed by flames. He spent the night at the nearby RAF airbase before returning to Hornchurch the next day. In the meantime, Illner was able to return to France in his own badly damaged aircraft.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=40\u201341}}{{sfn|Claasen|2012|pp=51\u201352}}  \n\n===Battle of Britain===\nThe first phase of the [[Battle of Britain]] commenced on 10 July 1940, when German attacks on targets along the coast of England and on shipping were stepped up in the [[Kanalkampf]] (Channel war). These were designed to draw out and destroy [[RAF Fighter Command]], necessary for the proposed [[Operation Sea Lion|invasion of Britain]].{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}}{{sfn|Claasen|2012|p=50}}{{sfn|Thompson|1953|pp=76\u201377}} As part of [[No. 11 Group RAF|No. 11 Group]], tasked with the defence of southeast England, Deere's squadron was to be heavily involved in the Battle of Britain.{{sfn|Thompson|1953|p=87}}{{sfn|Claasen|2012|p=140}}\n\nPoor weather conditions meant that No. 54 Squadron saw little action until 24 July, when the Luftwaffe mounted several large bombing raids against convoys in the Thames estuary. With one raid in the morning having been disrupted by Deere and his flight, during a second raid at midday that included at least 20 bombers and 30 fighters, he destroyed a Me 109.{{sfn|Thompson|1953|p=78}}{{sfn|Claasen|2012|pp=63\u201364}} This was his first victory of the Battle of Britain{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=42}} and by the end of the action, the squadron had accounted for 16 Me 109s for the loss of two pilots.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=43\u201344}} A few days later, Deere was promoted to the rank of [[flying officer]]<ref>{{London Gazette|date=3 September 1940|issue=34937|pages=5343\u20135344|nolink=yes}}</ref> and the squadron, having flown more sorties than any other during July, was sent back to Cattrick for a rest.{{sfn|Claasen|2012|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nNo. 54 Squadron returned to Hornchurch on 8 August 1940 and flew an uneventful patrol later that day.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=44}} On 12 August, Deere, while leading the squadron, pursued and shot down a Me 109 that broke up his section's attack on a group of bombers off the coast near North Foreland. While returning to Hornchurch, he encountered a group of Me 110s, one of which he shot down.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=45}} On 15 August, during an attempt by the squadron to intercept a bombing raid but encountered 40 Me 109s. Deere destroyed one and damaged another. On another interception mission that evening, the squadron engaged a group of Me 109s escorting Dornier Do 17 bombers flying towards London. He pursued one Me 109 and shot it down over the English Channel. A second was also destroyed, Deere having pursued it inland of the French coast. Heading back to England, he encountered five Me 109s which attempted to block his flight path. He was able to make the English coast but his Spitfire had taken damage from the Me 109s before they broke away. He was forced to bail out at low altitude; as he exited the cockpit, he struck the tailplane which injured his wrist. Initially taken to [[RAF Kenley]], at which time he discovered his watch had been damaged by a German bullet, he was admitted to [[Queen Victoria Hospital|Victoria Hospital]] for treatment.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=46\u201348}} He discharged himself the following day and was back on operations on 17 August.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=49}} Deere was shot down again on 28 August, this time by a Spitfire in an incidence of [[friendly fire]], but parachuted to safety. He had earlier destroyed a Me 109, but not being able to see it crash and thus only claimed it as a probable.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=55}} His abandoned Spitfire went on to crash at Boreham and in 1973, its engine and other remnants were recovered. On 30 August, a quieter day for the squadron with only two patrols, he engaged a Dornier Do 17 which he again, not being able to physically confirm its destruction, claimed as a probable.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=56}}\n\nThe following day the Luftwaffe raided Hornchurch, which had been caught unawares. The squadron was scrambled, with Deere leading a section of three Spitfires as they taxied down the runway. The German bombers in the meantime released their munitions onto the runway. All three aeroplanes of Deere's section were destroyed with his Spitfire was blown on its back, trapping him. With injuries to his scalp, he was extracted by another pilot of his section. He ignored instructions to return to duty on 2 September,{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=59}} flying a patrol a day earlier.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=57\u201358}} He only had two more days of operations for the squadron and moved back to Catterick for yet another period of rest and recovery{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=59}} and would play no further role in the Battle of Britain.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=62}} Since the beginning of 1940, its pilot had accounted for the destruction of at least 92 enemy aircraft.{{sfn|Claasen|2012|p=140}}\n\nShortly after the squadron's return to Yorkshire, Deere's award of a [[Medal bar|bar]] to his DFC was announced. The published citation read:\n{{Quote|Since the outbreak of war this officer has personally destroyed eleven, and probably one other, enemy aircraft, and assisted in the destruction of two more. In addition to the skill and gallantry he has shown in leading his flight, and in many instances his squadron, Flight Lieutenant Deere has displayed conspicuous bravery and determination in pressing home his attacks against superior numbers of enemy aircraft, often pursuing them across the Channel in order to shoot them down. As a leader he shows outstanding dash and determination.|''London Gazette'', No. 34940, 6 September 1940.<ref>{{London Gazette |date=6 September 1940 |issue=34940 |page=5407 |nolink=yes}}</ref>}}\n\n===Squadron Leader, America===\nNo. 54 Squadron remained in Yorkshire for the remainder of 1940, classified as a training unit.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=61\u201362}} Deere was one of a few pilots to remain as an instructor with most of the experienced aircrew being posted to other squadrons.{{Sfn|Wynn|1981|p=112}} Consequently, he was involved in practice flights with new pilots, bringing them up to speed with combat tactics. On one such flight in December 1940, he collided with a trainee's aircraft, which saw his Spitfire losing most of its tail and going into a spin. Bailing out with some difficulty due to the centrifugal forces of the spinning aircraft, he became trapped against the remnants of the tail fin. He was finally able to break free as the Spitfire approached the ground, but his parachute, which had been damaged, failed to fully open. Deere landed in a pool of farm sewerage which broke much of his fall. As a result of this incident he was rested from active flying.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=62\u201363}}\n\nIn January 1941 Deere was promoted to acting squadron leader and tasked as an operations room controller at Catterick. Due to weather conditions, flying was limited and No. 54 Squadron shifted back to Hornchurch in February. The squadron's role was now to conduct offensive sweeps, codenamed Rhubarbs, over France.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=66\u201367}} Deere soon tired of his controller duties and sought a return to flying operations. In May 1941, he was posted to [[No. 602 Squadron RAF|No. 602 Squadron]], which operated Spitfires from [[RAF Ayr|Ayr]], as one of its [[flight commander]]s. This move saw him return to the rank of flight lieutenant.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=68\u201369}} \n\nWhen Deere arrived at No. 602 Squadron, he was already well known for his reputation both as a fighter ace and narrow escapes.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=69}} On an early practice flight over the [[North Sea]] with the squadron, his Spitfire developed engine trouble. He only just made the Scottish coast and and crash landed in a potato field, flipping his aircraft onto its back, temporarily trapping him. He was able to wriggle free and make his way back to Ayr.{{sfn|Smith|2003|pp=70\u201371}} At the end of July he took over as Officer Commanding No. 602 Squadron, and on 1 August it moved back to [[RAF Kenley]]. On the same day he shot down another Bf 109.\n\nHe was promoted to the [[war substantive]] rank of [[flight lieutenant]] on 28 July 1941,<ref>{{London Gazette |date=15 August 1941 |issue=35247 |page=4726 |nolink=yes}}</ref> and to the permanent rank on 28 October 1941.<ref>{{London Gazette |date=12 May 1944 |supp=y |issue=36514 |page=2230 |nolink=yes}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1942 he was sent on a lecturing and public relations trip to America teaching American pilots fighter tactics learnt in the Battle of Britain.\n\n===Biggin Hill wing leader===\n[[File:Dowding and The Few.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Deere with fellow Battle of Britain pilots at a reunion in London in September 1942.

In August he went on a course at RAF Staff College and was subsequently posted to Headquarters [[No. 13 Group RAF|No. 13 Group]] on staff duties.\n\nHe engineered a return to operations, somewhat unofficially, as a supernumerary with [[No. 611 Squadron RAF|No. 611 Squadron]] at [[RAF Biggin Hill]]. He shot down an [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]] soon after, but wrote of his great respect for the type and its pilots.\n\nHe was given command of the Kenley fighter wing, but this was changed at the last minute to keep him as [[wing leader]] at Biggin Hill. While there, Deere was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, the citation reading: \n<blockquote>This officer has displayed exceptional qualities of skill which have played a large part in the successes of formations he has led. His fearlessness, tenacity and unswerving devotion to duty have inspired all with whom he has flown.

When the fighter wing moved further into Europe, he was posted to HQ 84 Group Control Centre as Wing Commander Plans until July 1945 when he became Station Commander at Biggin Hill.

As part of this involvement, he publicly recounted the story of how he flew as an escort to the aircraft delivering a replacement leg for Bader, who had been shot down and was a prisoner of war.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=145}} In 1990, he was again involved with a \"This is your Life\" show, this time a New Zealand version, for his compatriot [[Johnny Checketts]] who had flown with him during his Biggin Hill days.
