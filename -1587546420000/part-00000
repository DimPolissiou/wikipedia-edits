McMahon]], at the age of 12. At that point, McMahon became interested in following his father's professional wrestling footsteps and often accompanied him on trips to [[Madison Square Garden]]. McMahon wanted to be a wrestler, but his father did not let him, explaining that promoters did not appear on the show and should stay apart from their wrestlers.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nIn 1968, McMahon graduated from [[East Carolina University]]<ref name=\"Roderick\"/> with a business degree and after a nondescript career as a traveling salesman, he was eager to assume a managerial role in his father's [[WWE#World Wide Wrestling Federation|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] promotion. In 1969, McMahon made his debut as an in-ring announcer for the WWWF's ''[[List of former WWE programming#All-Star Wrestling (1974\u20131986)|All-Star Wrestling]]''.<ref name=\"McMahonFamily\">{{cite book|last=Kaelberer|first=Angie Peterson|title=The McMahons: Vince McMahon and Family|publisher=Capstone Press|year=2003|page=[https://archive.org/details/mcmahonsvincemcm0000kael/page/15 15]|isbn=0-7368-2143-0|url=https://archive.org/details/mcmahonsvincemcm0000kael/page/15}}</ref> In 1971, he was assigned to a small territory in Maine, where he promoted his first card. He later became the play-by-play commentator for television matches after he replaced Ray Morgan in 1971, a role he regularly maintained until November 1997.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, McMahon became the prominent force in his father's company and, over the next decade, assisted his father in tripling TV syndication.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rPCGDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA152&lpg=PA152&dq=inoki%20vs%20ali%20vince%20mcmahon%20jr&source=bl&ots=FTaXQPN3L8&sig=FApa6eTlPxfy2djRuwfTTnKTz6I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi947_2kcfOAhXHBcAKHbK4DLMQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=inoki%20vs%20ali%20vince%20mcmahon%20jr&f=false|title=Ali vs. Inoki: The Forgotten Fight That Inspired Mixed Martial Arts and Launched Sports Entertainment|first=Josh|last=Gross|date=June 9, 2016|publisher=BenBella Books, Inc.|via=Google Books}}</ref> He pushed for the renaming of the company to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).

The various promoters shared an understanding that they would not invade each other's territories, as this practice had gone on undeterred for decades;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infinitecore.ca/superstar/index.php?threadid=68183|title=KM : Reading Topic :  WWF NATIONAL EXPANSION|publisher=}}</ref> McMahon had a different vision of what the industry could become. In 1983, the WWF split from the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] a second time, after initially splitting from them in 1963 before rejoining them in 1971. The NWA was the governing body for all the regional territories across the country and as far away as Japan.\n\nHe began expanding the company nationally by promoting in areas outside of the company's Northeast U.S. stomping grounds and by signing talent from other companies, such as the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA). In 1984, he recruited [[Hulk Hogan]] to be the WWF's charismatic new megastar, and the two quickly drew the ire of industry peers as the promotion began traveling and broadcasting into rival territories. Nevertheless, McMahon (who still also fronted as the WWF's squeaky clean babyface announcer) created ''[[1980s professional wrestling boom|The Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]'' by incorporating pop music stars into wrestling storylines. As a result, the WWF was able to expand its fanbase into a national mainstream audience as the promotion was featured heavily on MTV programming. On March 31, 1985, he ran [[WrestleMania I|the first WrestleMania]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], available on [[closed circuit television]] in various markets throughout the U.S.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, McMahon shaped the WWF into a unique sports entertainment brand that reached out to family audiences while attracting fans who had never before paid attention to pro wrestling. By directing his storylines towards highly publicized supercards, McMahon capitalized on a fledgling revenue stream by promoting these events live on [[pay-per-view]] television. In 1987, the WWF reportedly drew 93,173 fans to the [[Silverdome|Pontiac Silverdome]] (which was called the \"biggest crowd in sports-entertainment history\") for [[WrestleMania III]], which featured the main event of Hulk Hogan versus [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]].<ref name=\"corporatebio\">{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/company/bios/vk_mcmahon.jsp |title=Vince McMahon's biography |accessdate=January 14, 2008 |publisher=WWE Corporate |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215125621/http://corporate.wwe.com/company/bios/vk_mcmahon.jsp |archivedate=December 15, 2007 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==== Attitude Era ====\n{{main|Attitude Era}}\nAfter struggling against [[Ted Turner]]'s [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), McMahon cemented the WWF as the preeminent wrestling promotion in the late 1990s when he initiated a new brand strategy that eventually returned the WWF to prominence. Sensing a public shift towards a more hardened and cynical fan base, McMahon redirected storylines towards a more adult-oriented model. The concept became known as \"WWF Attitude\", and McMahon commenced the new era when he manipulated the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]] away from [[Bret Hart]] at [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] in what is now known as the \"[[Montreal Screwjob]].\"<ref name=\"Survivor Series - Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1997/mainevent/|title=Survivor Series 1997 main event (Montreal Screwjob)|accessdate=January 14, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> McMahon, who for years had downplayed his ownership of the company and was mostly known as a commentator, became involved in WWF storylines as the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|evil]] Mr. McMahon, who began a legendary feud with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], who challenged the boss's authority. As a result, the WWF suddenly found itself back in national pop-culture, drawing millions of viewers for its weekly ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' broadcasts, which ranked among the highest-rated shows on cable television.<ref name=\"corporatebio\"/>\n\nIn October 1999, McMahon led the WWF in an [[initial public offering]] of company stock. McMahon acquired the fading WCW from [[Turner Broadcasting System]] on March 23, 2001, bringing an end to the [[Monday Night Wars]].<ref>{{cite web|title= WWF buys rival WCW |url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/03/23/deals/wwf/|accessdate=March 12, 2016|website=CNN Money|date=March 23, 2001}}</ref> On April 1, 2001, [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] filed for bankruptcy, leaving WWF as the last major wrestling promotion at that time.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ringside: A History of Professional Wrestling in America|last=Beekman|first=Scott|page=[https://archive.org/details/ringsidehistoryo00beek/page/139 139]|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn=978-0275984014|url=https://archive.org/details/ringsidehistoryo00beek/page/139}}</ref>\n\n=== Other business dealings ===\n[[File:Ron Killings & Vince McMahon laughing.jpg|thumb|McMahon sharing a joke with [[Ron Killings]] at the 2008 ''[[WWE Tribute to the Troops|Tribute to the Troops]]'' event]]\nIn 1979, Vince and Linda purchased the [[Cape Cod Coliseum]] and the [[Cape Cod Buccaneers]] of the [[Atlantic Coast Hockey League (1981\u201387)|Atlantic Coast Hockey League]]. In addition to pro wrestling and hockey, they began selling out rock concerts, including [[Van Halen]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]], in non-summer months, traditionally considered unprofitable due to lack of tourists. This venture led the McMahons to join the International Association of Arena Managers, learning the details of the arena business and networking with other managers through IAAM conferences, which Linda later called a great benefit to WWE's success.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sullivan |first=Kevin |date=2013 |title=WWE 50 |page=33}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, McMahon founded the [[World Bodybuilding Federation]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Dilbert|first=Ryan|title=Vince McMahon's Failed Attempt to Take over Bodybuilding|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2542941-vince-mcmahons-failed-attempt-to-take-over-bodybuilding|work=Salon.com|date=January 25, 2018|accessdate=November 7, 2015}}</ref> The organization folded in 1992.\n\nIn 2000, McMahon again ventured outside the world of professional wrestling by launching the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]], a professional [[American football]] league.

While he did publicly identify himself as the owner of the WWF outside of WWF programming, on TV his ownership of the WWF was considered an [[open secret]] through the mid-1990s. Jack Tunney was portrayed as the president of WWF instead of him.\n\nMcMahon made his commentary debut in 1971 when he replaced Ray Morgan after Morgan had a pay dispute with McMahon's father, [[Vincent J. McMahon]], shortly before a scheduled TV taping. The elder McMahon let Morgan walk instead of giving in to his demands and needed a replacement on the spot, offering it to his son. For the younger McMahon, it was also somewhat of a compromise, as it allowed him to appear on television. McMahon wanted to be a wrestler but his father did not let him, explaining that promoters did not appear on the show and should stay apart from their wrestlers.<ref name=\"DVD\">''McMahon'' DVD</ref>\n\nMcMahon eventually became the regular play-by-play commentator and maintained that role until November 1997, portraying himself as easily excited and over-the-top. In addition to matches, McMahon also hosted other WWF shows, and introduced WWF programming to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on [[Black Saturday (wrestling)|Black Saturday]], upon the WWF's acquisition of [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] and its lucrative [[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday night timeslot]] (McMahon sold the timeslot to [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] after the move backfired on him and he eventually acquired JCP's successor company, [[World Championship Wrestling]], from [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]] in 2001). At the [[Slammy Award|1987 Slammy Awards]], McMahon performed in a musical number and sang the song \"Stand Back\".<ref name=slam>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/MatMatters/2008/12/07/7661906.html|title=Bringing back Slammy Awards \u2013 a good, bad idea|author=Bishop, Matt and Matt Mackinder|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=December 9, 2008|date=December 7, 2008}}</ref> The [[Camp (style)|campy]] \"Stand Back\" video has since resurfaced several times over the years as a [[running gag]] between McMahon and any [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] wrestler he is feuding with at that particular time, and was included on the 2006 ''McMahon'' DVD.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nAs with most play-by-play commentators, McMahon was a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] \"voice of the fans\", in contrast to the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[color commentator]], usually [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Bobby Heenan]] or [[Jerry Lawler]]. While most of McMahon's on-screen physicality took place during his \"Mr. McMahon\" character later in his career, he was involved in physical altercations on WWF television only a few times as a commentator or host; in 1977, when he and [[Arnold Skaaland]] were struck from behind by [[Lou Albano|Captain Lou Albano]] (as part of a kayfabe \"Manager Of the Year\" storyline, when Albano was disgruntled over losing to Skaaland); in 1985, when [[Andre the Giant]] grabbed him by the collar during an interview on ''[[Tuesday Night Titans]]'' (Andre had become irritated at McMahon's questions regarding his feud with [[Big John Studd]] and their match at [[WrestleMania I|the first WrestleMania]]); on the September 28, 1991 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'', when [[Roddy Piper]] mistakenly hit him with a folding chair aimed at [[Ric Flair]] (requiring McMahon to be taken out of the arena on a [[stretcher]]), and again on the November 8, 1993 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', when [[Randy Savage]] hurled him to the floor in an attempt to attack [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]] after McMahon attempted to restrain him. McMahon can also be seen screaming at medics and WWF personnel during the May 26, 1990 episode of ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling'' (after Hulk Hogan was attacked by [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] during a segment of ''The Brother Love Show''), when Hogan was not moved out of the arena quickly enough.\n\n==== Start of the Mr. McMahon character (1996\u20131997) ====\n{{see also|Montreal Screwjob}}\nThroughout late 1996 and into 1997, McMahon slowly began to be referred to as the owner on WWF television while remaining as the company's lead play-by-play commentator. On the September 23, 1996 ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', [[Jim Ross]] delivered a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)#Worked shoots|worked shoot]] promo during which he ran down McMahon, outing him as [[chairman]] and not just a commentator for the first time in WWF storylines. This was followed up on the October 23 ''Raw'' with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] referring to then-WWF President [[Gorilla Monsoon]] as \"just a puppet\" and that it was McMahon \"pulling all the strings\". The March 17, 1997 ''WWF Raw Is War'' is cited by some as the beginning of the Mr. McMahon character, as after [[Bret Hart]] lost to [[Sid Vicious (wrestler)|Sycho Sid]] in a steel cage match for the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]], Hart engaged in an [[Profanity|expletive]]-laden rant against McMahon and WWF management. This rant followed Hart shoving McMahon to the ground when he attempted to conduct a post-match interview. McMahon, himself, returned to the commentary position and nearly cursed out Hart before being calmed down by Ross and Lawler.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nMcMahon largely remained a commentator after the Bret Hart incident on ''Raw''. On September 22, 1997, on the first-ever ''Raw'' to be broadcast from [[Madison Square Garden]], Bret's brother [[Owen Hart]] was giving a speech to the fans in attendance. During his speech, Stone Cold Steve Austin entered the ring with five [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officers following and assaulted Hart. When it appeared Austin would fight the officers, McMahon ran into the ring to lecture him that he could not physically compete; at the time, Austin was recovering from a broken neck after Owen Hart [[Botch (professional wrestling)|botched]] a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] in his match against Austin at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]]. After telling McMahon that he respects the fact that he and the WWF cared, Austin attacked McMahon with a Stone Cold Stunner, leaving McMahon in shock. Austin was then arrested on charges of trespassing, assault, and assaulting a police officer. This marked the beginning of the Austin-McMahon rivalry.\n\nAt [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] in 1997, [[Bret Hart]] defended his WWF Championship against long-time rival [[Shawn Michaels]] in the main event. During the match, Michaels applied Hart's signature [[Professional wrestling holds|submission maneuver]] [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|The Sharpshooter]] on Hart. Though Hart did not submit, McMahon ordered the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] to ring the bell, thus [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Screwjob|screwing]] Hart out of the title and making Michaels the champion and making McMahon turn [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] for the first time on WWF television. This incident was subsequently dubbed the \"Montreal Screwjob\".<ref name=\"Survivor Series - Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart\" /> Following the incident, McMahon left the commentary table for good ([[Jim Ross]] replaced McMahon as lead commentator) and the Mr. McMahon character began.\n\n==== Feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin (1997\u20131999) ====\n{{main|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporate Ministry|l1=The Corporation}}In December 1997 on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', the night after [[D-Generation X: In Your House]], McMahon talked about the behavior and attitude of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], such as Austin having assaulted WWF Commissioner Sgt. Slaughter and commentators such as Jim Ross and McMahon himself. Mr. McMahon demanded that Austin defend his Intercontinental championship against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] in a rematch. As in the previous match, Austin used his pickup truck as a weapon against The Rock and the [[Nation of Domination]] gang. Austin decided to forfeit the title to The Rock, but instead, Austin gave The Rock a ''Stone Cold Stunner'' and knocked McMahon off the ring ropes.\n\nOn the January 19, 1998 episode of Raw Is War, McMahon called [[Mike Tyson]] to the ring for a major announcement. Before McMahon could make the announcement (that Tyson would serve as a ringside enforcer at [[Wrestlemania XIV]] for the WWE World title match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels) Austin interrupted and confronted Tyson culminating with Austin displaying his middle finger right in Tyson's face. Tyson shoved Austin at which point WWE security and Tyson's entourage intervened and separated both men. McMahon was incensed by Austin's actions screaming \"YOU RUINED IT\" and had to be held back from attacking Austin himself.\n\nOn the March 2 edition of Raw Is War, Mike Tyson joined [[D-Generation X]], led by WWE World Champion Shawn Michaels. A week later, Austin called out McMahon incensed by Tyson's alignment with Michaels. Austin verbally abused McMahon and attempted to provoke an agitated McMahon into hitting him (Austin) but McMahon left. On the following episode of Raw Is War, McMahon claimed he hadn't hit Austin on the previous episode of Raw as he didn't want to ruin the Wrestlemania XIV main event. Asked to explain what this meant, McMahon stated Austin would be unable to compete with a broken jaw. After initial attempts to dodge the question of whether he wanted Austin to become WWF Champion, McMahon finally answered with \"it's not just a \"no\", it's an OH HELL NO\" mimicking Austin's \"hell yeah\" catchphrase. McMahon didn't get involved during the Wrestlemania XIV main event during which Mike Tyson turned on Shawn Michaels and assisted Austin in becoming WWE Champion.\n\nOn the March 30 ''Raw Is War'', the night after Austin won the WWF title at WrestleMania XIV, McMahon presented him with a new title belt and warned Austin that he did not approve of his rebellious nature. Austin responded by delivering the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' to McMahon for the second time. On the April 13 episode of Raw Is War, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no-contest when [[Mick Foley|Dude Love]] interfered. This marked the first time since June 10, 1996, that [[Monday Night Wars|''Raw'' beat WCW's ''Nitro'' in the ratings]]. This led to a title match between Love and Austin at [[Unforgiven: In Your House|Unforgiven]], for which McMahon sat ringside and attempted to assist Love in winning the match. Love ultimately did win by disqualification when Austin hit McMahon with a chair. Austin retained the title which couldn't change hands by disqualification under regular match rules. In a title rematch at [[Over the Edge: In Your House]], Austin again retained, despite McMahon being the referee and his \"Corporate Stooges\", [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. While McMahon was incapacitated by an accidental Love chair shot, Austin delivered the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' to Love and used McMahon's hand to count his pinfall victory.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, McMahon said he was \"damn sick and tired\" of seeing Stone Cold Steve Austin as the WWF Champion and developed a \"master plan\" to remove the championship from Austin. By employing the services of [[The Brothers of Destruction|The Undertaker and Kane]], McMahon set up a triple threat match for the WWF championship at [[Breakdown: In Your House]], in which Undertaker and Kane could only win by pinning Austin. At Breakdown, Austin lost the title after being pinned simultaneously by both Undertaker and Kane. However, no new champion was crowned. The following night on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', McMahon attempted to announce a new WWF Champion. He held a presentation ceremony and introduced The Undertaker and Kane. After saying that both deserved to be the WWF Champion, Austin drove a [[Ice resurfacer|Zamboni]] into the arena and attacked McMahon before police officers stopped him, and arrested him. Because The Undertaker and Kane both failed to defend McMahon from Austin, McMahon did not name a new champion, but instead made a match at [[WWE Judgment Day#1998|Judgment Day]] between The Undertaker and Kane with Austin as the [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special referee]]. This prompted The Undertaker and Kane to attack Mr. McMahon, injuring his ankle because he gave them the [[Finger (gesture)|finger]] behind their backs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/980928.html|title=WWF RAW is WAR 28.9.98|first=Christopher|last=Zimmerman|publisher=Slash Wrestling|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref>\n\nAt Judgement Day, there was still no champion crowned as Austin declared himself the winner after counting a double pinfall three count for both men. McMahon ordered the WWF Championship to be defended in a [[Professional wrestling tournament|14-man tournament]] named [[Survivor Series (1998)#Tournaments bracket|Deadly Games]] at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]] in 1998.

Stephanie played an \"innocent sweet girl\" who was kidnapped by The Ministry twice. The first time she was kidnapped, she was found by [[Ken Shamrock]] on behalf of McMahon in a basement of the stadium. The second time she was kidnapped, The Undertaker attempted to marry her whilst she was forcefully tied to the Ministry's crucifix, but she was saved by Steve Austin. This angle saw a brief friendship develop between McMahon and Austin, cooling their long-running feud. McMahon became a member of the short-lived stable [[The Union (professional wrestling)|The Union]], during May 1999. McMahon's son Shane merged the Corporation with Undertaker's Ministry of Darkness to form the [[Corporate Ministry]]. On the June 7 episode of ''Raw Is War'', McMahon was revealed as the \"Higher Power\" behind the Corporate Ministry.

He had decided to vacate the title during the following Monday's ''Raw Is War'' because he was not allowed on WWF TV because of the stipulations of the Fully Loaded 1999 contract he signed. However, Stone Cold Steve Austin reinstated him in return for a WWF title shot. Over the next few months, McMahon and Triple H feuded, with the linchpin of the feud being Triple H's storyline marriage to Stephanie McMahon. The feud culminated at [[Armageddon (1999)|Armageddon]] in 1999; McMahon faced Triple H in a [[Hardcore wrestling|No Holds Barred match]] which McMahon lost. Afterward, Stephanie turned on him, revealing her true colors. McMahon, along with his son Shane, then disappeared from WWF television, unable to accept the union between Triple H and Stephanie.

The man whose wrestler lost would have his head shaved bald. After the contract signing on ''Raw'', Trump pushed McMahon over the table in the ring onto his head after McMahon provoked Trump with several finger pokes to the shoulders. Later at a press conference, McMahon, during a photo opportunity, offered to shake hands with Trump but retracted his hand as Trump put out his. McMahon went on to fiddle with Trump's tie and flick Trump's nose. This angered Trump as he then slapped McMahon across the face.

He also talked about many subjects, including an investigation by the [[United States Congress]] and owing money to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. McMahon also declared a battle royal to determine a new ''Raw'' General Manager, which was won by [[William Regal]].

Fans could register online, and each week randomly selected fans would receive a part of the $1,000,000. McMahon's Million Dollar Mania lasted just three weeks and was suspended after the 3-hour Draft episode of ''Raw'' on June 23. After giving away $500,000, explosions tore apart the ''Raw'' stage, which fell and collapsed on top of McMahon. On June 30, Shane addressed the WWE audience before ''Raw'', informing the fans that his family had chosen to keep his father's condition private. He also urged the WWE roster to stand together during what he described as a \"turbulent time\". The McMahons made several requests to the wrestlers for solidarity, before finally appointing [[Mike Adamle]] as the new general manager of ''Raw'' to restore order to the brand.\n\n==== Feud with The Legacy and Bret Hart (2009\u20132010) ====\nOn the January 5, 2009 ''Raw'', [[Chris Jericho]] told Stephanie McMahon that McMahon would be returning to ''Raw'' soon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/01052009/|title=Big Night In The Big Easy|accessdate=January 5, 2009|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref> The following week, Jericho was ([[kayfabe]]) fired from WWE by Stephanie. On the January 19 ''Raw'', McMahon returned, as a face, and supported his daughter's decision on Jericho, but Stephanie rehired him. [[Randy Orton]] then came out and assaulted McMahon after harassing Stephanie. McMahon returned on the March 30 ''Raw'' with his son, Shane, and son-in-law Triple H to confront Orton. The night after [[WrestleMania XXV]], McMahon appeared on ''Raw'' to announce Orton would not receive another championship opportunity at [[Backlash (2009)|Backlash]], but compete in a six-man tag team match with his [[The Legacy (professional wrestling)|Legacy]] stablemates against Triple H, Shane McMahon and himself. ''Raw'' General Manager [[Vickie Guerrero]] made the match for the WWE Championship. Orton then challenged McMahon to a match that night, in which Legacy assaulted him, and Orton also hitting him with the RKO. After being assisted by Triple H, Shane and a returning Batista, McMahon announced Batista would replace him in the match at Backlash. On the June 15 ''Raw'', McMahon announced that he had sold the ''Raw'' brand to businessman Donald Trump. The next week, during the ''Trump is Raw'' show, McMahon bought the brand back from Trump. On the June 29 ''Raw'', McMahon announced that every week, a celebrity guest host would control ''Raw'' for the night. He soon appeared on ''SmackDown'', putting [[Theodore Long]] on probation for his actions. On August 24 ''Raw'', McMahon had a birthday bash which was interrupted by The Legacy, and competed in a six-man tag team match with his long-time rival team [[D-Generation X|DX]], in which they won after the interference of [[John Cena]]. He continued to appear on ''SmackDown'', making occasional matches and reminding Long that he is still on probation. On the November 16 ''Raw'', McMahon was called out by guest host [[Roddy Piper]], who wanted a match with McMahon that night in [[Madison Square Garden]].

The two appeared to finally bury the hatchet, but after shaking hands, Vince kicked Hart in the groin and left the arena to a loud chorus of boos and the crowd chanting \"You screwed Bret! You screwed Bret!\".<ref name=\"us.wwe.com\"/> A match was then booked between the two at [[WrestleMania XXVI]], which saw Hart defeat McMahon in a No Holds Barred Lumberjack match. On the May 31 ''Raw'', McMahon returned to congratulate Hart on becoming the new Raw General Manager. On the June 22 ''Raw'', McMahon fired Hart for not dealing with ''[[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT]]'' season one rookies, known as [[Nexus (professional wrestling)|The Nexus]]. That same night, he announced the new General Manager would be anonymous and make decisions via emails, which would be read by [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]. The General Manager's first decision was McMahon to be the guest referee for a WWE Championship match that night between John Cena and [[Sheamus]]. The match was interrupted by The Nexus who then attacked McMahon. McMahon appeared in a segment on the November 1 ''Raw'', in a coma from the attack by The Nexus. He woke up and his doctor ([[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]) explained what had happened since he had been out. The scene transitioned to Stephanie McMahon waking up, revealing [[Dream sequence|it was all a dream]].\n\n==== Sporadic appearances (2011\u2013present) ====\nIn early 2011, McMahon once again stepped away from WWE storylines to focus on both his corporate and backstage duties.\n\nOn the June 27 episode of ''Raw'', [[CM Punk]] made a scathing on-air speech criticizing WWE and McMahon about the way WWE was run. McMahon suspended Punk but reinstated him at the behest of Punk's [[Money in the Bank (2011)|Money in the Bank]] opponent, WWE Champion John Cena. At the pay-per-view, McMahon and Vice President of Talent Relations [[John Laurinaitis]] interfered on Cena's behalf but Punk was ultimately successful and walked out of the company with the championship. On the following ''Raw'', Triple H returned and, on behalf of WWE's board of directors, fired McMahon from his position of running ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'', though leaving him chairman of the board. Triple H then announced he had been designated Chief Operating Officer of WWE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-07-18/mcmahon-relieved-of-duties|title=McMahon Released |accessdate=July 16, 2011|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref> McMahon returned on the October 10 ''Raw'', firing Triple H from running ''Raw'', stating the board of directors had called Triple H a financial catastrophe, and that the [[List of WWE personnel|WWE employees]] had voted [[Motion of no confidence|no confidence]] in him the previous week.

Cena defeated Big Show in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]], and McMahon fired Laurinaitis. McMahon announced [[AJ Lee|AJ]] as ''Raw''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s new general manager at ''[[WWE Raw 1000|Raw 1000]]'' and made Booker T SmackDown's new general manager on August 3 episode of ''SmackDown''. After CM Punk interrupted him on the October 8 episode of ''Raw'', he challenged Punk to a match, threatening to fire him if he declined. The match did not officially start, but McMahon held his own in a brawl with Punk until Punk attempted the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Go to Sleep|GTS]]. Ryback and Cena interfered and McMahon ultimately booked Punk in a match with Ryback at [[Hell in a Cell (2012)|Hell in a Cell]].\n\nDuring the buildup for the [[Royal Rumble (2013)|2013 Royal Rumble]], McMahon told CM Punk that if [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]] interfered in his match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], Punk would forfeit his title. During the match, the lights went out and Rock was attacked by what appeared to be The Shield, leading to Rock's loss. Vince came out and restarted the match at Rock's request and Rock was victorious. The next night on ''Raw'', while conducting a performance review on [[Paul Heyman]], he was assaulted by the returning [[Brock Lesnar]], who attacked him with the [[Facebuster#Fireman's carry facebuster|F-5]]. According to WWE.com, McMahon broke his pelvis and required surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2013-01-28/mr-mcmahon-injury-update-after-brock-lesnar-attack-26088187|title=Mr. McMahon suffers broken pelvis due to Brock Lesnar attack|publisher=WWE.com|date=January 29, 2013|accessdate=January 29, 2013}}</ref> Vince sought revenge on Heyman and faced him in a street fight on the February 25 episode of ''Raw'', but Lesnar again interfered, only for Triple H to interfere as well, setting up a rematch between Lesnar and Triple H at [[WrestleMania 29]].

After Shane ran ''Raw'' for the rest of April, at [[Payback (2016)|Payback]], McMahon announced Shane and Stephanie had joint control.\n\nOn the April 3, 2017 episode of ''Raw'', McMahon returned to announce [[Kurt Angle]] as the new Raw General Manager and the upcoming [[2017 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-wrestling-results/wwe-raw-results/77098-wwe-raw-results-april-3-wrestlemania/|title=WWE RAW Results - 4/3/17 (Night after WrestleMania 33) - WWE News and Results, RAW and Smackdown Results, TNA News, ROH News|first=Mike|last=Tedesco|date=April 3, 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn September 5, it was announced that McMahon would make an appearance on the September 12 episode of ''SmackDown Live''. At the end of that night as a [[Babyface (professional wrestling)|face]], McMahon confronted [[Kevin Owens]], who was unhappy about Vince's son Shane attacking him the week before, which resulted in Shane being suspended. McMahon was furious about the heinous words regarding his family, and how Owens was not respectful, and how he planned to prosecute everybody who wronged him. McMahon warned him that his lawsuit would result in him being fired, but McMahon has the cash to deal with that empty threat. This prompted Owens to say Shane put his hands on him, but McMahon said he suspended Shane for not finishing off Owens. Shane was then reinstated to face Owens at the ''Hell in a Cell'' pay-per-view. Owens then attacked McMahon, leaving him lying in the ring. Even with several referees present, Owens continued to attack McMahon, and splashed down on him from atop one of the ring posts, resulting in McMahon being ([[kayfabe]]) injured. [[Stephanie McMahon]] also returned to help her father, as he was attended to by WWE officials.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2017/0912/632078/wwe-smackdown-live-results/|title=WWE SmackDown Results - Vince McMahon Attacked, Three Title Matches, New Champions Crowned, More - WrestlingInc.com|work=WrestlingInc.com|access-date=2018-06-08|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn January 22, 2018, McMahon returned on ''[[Raw 25 Years]]'' to address the WWE Universe, only to later turn on them by calling them \"cheap\" turning heel once again. He was later confronted, and [[Stunner (professional wrestling)|stunnered]], by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. On March 12, McMahon made an appearance in a backstage segment with [[Roman Reigns]], announcing that Reigns would be suspended for his recent actions. On SmackDown 1000 McMahon returned as face once again after dancing on TruthTV.\n\nMcMahon returned once again to WWE television on the December 17, 2018, episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'', accompanied by his son [[Shane McMahon|Shane]], daughter [[Stephanie McMahon]], and his son-in-law [[Triple H]], promising to shake things up as they admitted they weren't performing as well as they should have. McMahon announced that the four of them combined would now [[kayfabe|''run'']] both ''Monday Night Raw'', and ''SmackDown Live'' together collectively.\n\n=== United States Wrestling Association (1993) ===\nWhile the Mr. McMahon character marked the first time that McMahon had been portrayed as a villain in WWF, in 1993, McMahon was engaged in a feud with [[Jerry Lawler]] as part of a cross-promotion between the WWF and the [[United States Wrestling Association]] (USWA). As part of the angle, McMahon sent various WWF wrestlers to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to dethrone Lawler as the \"king of professional wrestling\". This angle marked the first time that McMahon physically interjected himself into a match, as he occasionally tripped and punched at Lawler while seated ringside. During the angle, McMahon was not acknowledged as the owner of the WWF, and the feud was not acknowledged on WWF television, as the two continued to provide commentary together (along with [[Randy Savage]]) for the television show ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]''. The feud also helped build toward Lawler's match with [[Bret Hart]] at [[SummerSlam (1993)|SummerSlam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1993/|title=SummerSlam 1993 official results|accessdate=January 14, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> The peak of the angle came with [[Tatanka (wrestler)|Tatanka]] defeating Lawler to win the [[USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship|USWA Championship]] with McMahon gloating at Lawler while wearing the championship belt.<ref name=\"tatankabio\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Chavis|url=http://www.nativetatanka.com/bio2.html|title=Tatanka's Biography (Page 2)|accessdate=January 14, 2008|publisher=Native Tatanka |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071226140653/http://www.nativetatanka.com/bio2.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 26, 2007}}</ref> This storyline came to an abrupt end when Lawler was accused of raping a young girl in Memphis, and he was dropped from the WWF.

According to [[Jim Cornette]], the power walk was inspired by one of McMahon's favorite wrestlers as a child, [[Dr. Jerry Graham]].

Generally speaking, the character has been portrayed as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], though on occasion the character has been a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] as well.\n\nHis finishers consisted of the ''Pedigree'' ([[Facebuster#Double underhook facebuster|Double underhook facebuster]]), which was adopted from [[Triple H]], ''People's Elbow / Corporate Elbow'' ([[Feint]] [[leg drop]] transitioned into a high impact [[Professional wrestling attacks#Elbow drop|elbow drop]] to the opponent's chest, with theatrics) (taken from [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]), the [[Leg drop#Running leg drop|running jumping guillotine leg drop]] (parodied from [[Hulk Hogan]]) and the ''McStunner/Mr. McMahon Stunner'' ([[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Three-quarter facelock jawbreaker]]) inherited from [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]].{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n== Other media ==\nIn 2001, McMahon was interviewed by ''[[Playboy]]'' and performed an interview with his son Shane for the second issue of the magazine that year.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Playboy Interview: Vince McMahon |magazine=Playboy |pages=55\u201368 |date=February 2001}}</ref> In March 2006, at age 60, McMahon was featured on the cover of ''[[Muscle & Fitness]]'' magazine.

The DVD includes Vince's business life, such as acquiring WCW and ECW and the demise of the XFL. McMahon's top nine matches of his professional wrestling career are included in ''McMahon''.

The various promoters shared an understanding that they would not invade each other's territories, as this practice had gone on undeterred for decades;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infinitecore.ca/superstar/index.php?threadid=68183|title=KM : Reading Topic :  WWF NATIONAL EXPANSION|publisher=}}</ref> McMahon had a different vision of what the industry could become. In 1983, the WWF split from the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] a second time, after initially splitting from them in 1963 before rejoining them in 1971. The NWA was the governing body for all the regional territories across the country and as far away as Japan.\n\nHe began expanding the company nationally by promoting in areas outside of the company's Northeast U.S. stomping grounds and by signing talent from other companies, such as the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA). In 1984, he recruited [[Hulk Hogan]] to be the WWF's charismatic new megastar, and the two quickly drew the ire of industry peers as the promotion began traveling and broadcasting into rival territories. Nevertheless, McMahon (who still also fronted as the WWF's squeaky clean babyface announcer) created ''[[1980s professional wrestling boom|The Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]'' by incorporating pop music stars into wrestling storylines. As a result, the WWF was able to expand its fanbase into a national mainstream audience as the promotion was featured heavily on MTV programming. On March 31, 1985, he ran [[WrestleMania I|the first WrestleMania]] at [[Madison Square Garden]], available on [[closed circuit television]] in various markets throughout the U.S.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, McMahon shaped the WWF into a unique sports entertainment brand that reached out to family audiences while attracting fans who had never before paid attention to pro wrestling. By directing his storylines towards highly publicized supercards, McMahon capitalized on a fledgling revenue stream by promoting these events live on [[pay-per-view]] television. In 1987, the WWF reportedly drew 93,173 fans to the [[Silverdome|Pontiac Silverdome]] (which was called the \"biggest crowd in sports-entertainment history\") for [[WrestleMania III]], which featured the main event of Hulk Hogan versus [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]].<ref name=\"corporatebio\">{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/company/bios/vk_mcmahon.jsp |title=Vince McMahon's biography |accessdate=January 14, 2008 |publisher=WWE Corporate |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215125621/http://corporate.wwe.com/company/bios/vk_mcmahon.jsp |archivedate=December 15, 2007 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==== Attitude Era ====\n{{main|Attitude Era}}\nAfter struggling against [[Ted Turner]]'s [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), McMahon cemented the WWF as the preeminent wrestling promotion in the late 1990s when he initiated a new brand strategy that eventually returned the WWF to prominence. Sensing a public shift towards a more hardened and cynical fan base, McMahon redirected storylines towards a more adult-oriented model. The concept became known as \"WWF Attitude\", and McMahon commenced the new era when he manipulated the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]] away from [[Bret Hart]] at [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] in what is now known as the \"[[Montreal Screwjob]].\"<ref name=\"Survivor Series - Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1997/mainevent/|title=Survivor Series 1997 main event (Montreal Screwjob)|accessdate=January 14, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> McMahon, who for years had downplayed his ownership of the company and was mostly known as a commentator, became involved in WWF storylines as the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|evil]] Mr. McMahon, who began a legendary feud with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], who challenged the boss's authority. As a result, the WWF suddenly found itself back in national pop-culture, drawing millions of viewers for its weekly ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' broadcasts, which ranked among the highest-rated shows on cable television.<ref name=\"corporatebio\"/>\n\nIn October 1999, McMahon led the WWF in an [[initial public offering]] of company stock. McMahon acquired the fading WCW from [[Turner Broadcasting System]] on March 23, 2001, bringing an end to the [[Monday Night Wars]].<ref>{{cite web|title= WWF buys rival WCW |url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/03/23/deals/wwf/|accessdate=March 12, 2016|website=CNN Money|date=March 23, 2001}}</ref> On April 1, 2001, [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] filed for bankruptcy, leaving WWF as the last major wrestling promotion at that time.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ringside: A History of Professional Wrestling in America|last=Beekman|first=Scott|page=[https://archive.org/details/ringsidehistoryo00beek/page/139 139]|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn=978-0275984014|url=https://archive.org/details/ringsidehistoryo00beek/page/139}}</ref>\n\n=== Other business dealings ===\n[[File:Ron Killings & Vince McMahon laughing.jpg|thumb|McMahon sharing a joke with [[Ron Killings]] at the 2008 ''[[WWE Tribute to the Troops|Tribute to the Troops]]'' event]]\nIn 1979, Vince and Linda purchased the [[Cape Cod Coliseum]] and the [[Cape Cod Buccaneers]] of the [[Atlantic Coast Hockey League (1981\u201387)|Atlantic Coast Hockey League]]. In addition to pro wrestling and hockey, they began selling out rock concerts, including [[Van Halen]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]], in non-summer months, traditionally considered unprofitable due to lack of tourists. This venture led the McMahons to join the International Association of Arena Managers, learning the details of the arena business and networking with other managers through IAAM conferences, which Linda later called a great benefit to WWE's success.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sullivan |first=Kevin |date=2013 |title=WWE 50 |page=33}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, McMahon founded the [[World Bodybuilding Federation]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Dilbert|first=Ryan|title=Vince McMahon's Failed Attempt to Take over Bodybuilding|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2542941-vince-mcmahons-failed-attempt-to-take-over-bodybuilding|work=Salon.com|date=January 25, 2018|accessdate=November 7, 2015}}</ref> The organization folded in 1992.\n\nIn 2000, McMahon again ventured outside the world of professional wrestling by launching the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]], a professional [[American football]] league.

While he did publicly identify himself as the owner of the WWF outside of WWF programming, on TV his ownership of the WWF was considered an [[open secret]] through the mid-1990s. Jack Tunney was portrayed as the president of WWF instead of him.\n\nMcMahon made his commentary debut in 1971 when he replaced Ray Morgan after Morgan had a pay dispute with McMahon's father, [[Vincent J. McMahon]], shortly before a scheduled TV taping. The elder McMahon let Morgan walk instead of giving in to his demands and needed a replacement on the spot, offering it to his son. For the younger McMahon, it was also somewhat of a compromise, as it allowed him to appear on television.

In addition to matches, McMahon also hosted other WWF shows, and introduced WWF programming to [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on [[Black Saturday (wrestling)|Black Saturday]], upon the WWF's acquisition of [[Georgia Championship Wrestling]] and its lucrative [[WCW Saturday Night|Saturday night timeslot]] (McMahon sold the timeslot to [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] after the move backfired on him and he eventually acquired JCP's successor company, [[World Championship Wrestling]], from [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]] in 2001). At the [[Slammy Award|1987 Slammy Awards]], McMahon performed in a musical number and sang the song \"Stand Back\".<ref name=slam>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/MatMatters/2008/12/07/7661906.html|title=Bringing back Slammy Awards \u2013 a good, bad idea|author=Bishop, Matt and Matt Mackinder|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=December 9, 2008|date=December 7, 2008}}</ref> The [[Camp (style)|campy]] \"Stand Back\" video has since resurfaced several times over the years as a [[running gag]] between McMahon and any [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] wrestler he is feuding with at that particular time, and was included on the 2006 ''McMahon'' DVD.<ref name=\"DVD\"/>\n\nAs with most play-by-play commentators, McMahon was a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] \"voice of the fans\", in contrast to the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[color commentator]], usually [[Jesse Ventura]], [[Bobby Heenan]] or [[Jerry Lawler]]. While most of McMahon's on-screen physicality took place during his \"Mr. McMahon\" character later in his career, he was involved in physical altercations on WWF television only a few times as a commentator or host; in 1977, when he and [[Arnold Skaaland]] were struck from behind by [[Lou Albano|Captain Lou Albano]] (as part of a kayfabe \"Manager Of the Year\" storyline, when Albano was disgruntled over losing to Skaaland); in 1985, when [[Andre the Giant]] grabbed him by the collar during an interview on ''[[Tuesday Night Titans]]'' (Andre had become irritated at McMahon's questions regarding his feud with [[Big John Studd]] and their match at [[WrestleMania I|the first WrestleMania]]); on the September 28, 1991 episode of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]]'', when [[Roddy Piper]] mistakenly hit him with a folding chair aimed at [[Ric Flair]] (requiring McMahon to be taken out of the arena on a [[stretcher]]), and again on the November 8, 1993 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', when [[Randy Savage]] hurled him to the floor in an attempt to attack [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]] after McMahon attempted to restrain him. McMahon can also be seen screaming at medics and WWF personnel during the May 26, 1990 episode of ''WWF Superstars of Wrestling'' (after Hulk Hogan was attacked by [[John Tenta|Earthquake]] during a segment of ''The Brother Love Show''), when Hogan was not moved out of the arena quickly enough.\n\n==== Start of the Mr. McMahon character (1996\u20131997) ====\n{{see also|Montreal Screwjob}}\nThroughout late 1996 and into 1997, McMahon slowly began to be referred to as the owner on WWF television while remaining as the company's lead play-by-play commentator. On the September 23, 1996 ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', [[Jim Ross]] delivered a [[Shoot (professional wrestling)#Worked shoots|worked shoot]] promo during which he ran down McMahon, outing him as [[chairman]] and not just a commentator for the first time in WWF storylines. This was followed up on the October 23 ''Raw'' with [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] referring to then-WWF President [[Gorilla Monsoon]] as \"just a puppet\" and that it was McMahon \"pulling all the strings\". The March 17, 1997 ''WWF Raw Is War'' is cited by some as the beginning of the Mr. McMahon character, as after [[Bret Hart]] lost to [[Sid Vicious (wrestler)|Sycho Sid]] in a steel cage match for the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]], Hart engaged in an [[Profanity|expletive]]-laden rant against McMahon and WWF management. This rant followed Hart shoving McMahon to the ground when he attempted to conduct a post-match interview. McMahon, himself, returned to the commentary position and nearly cursed out Hart before being calmed down by Ross and Lawler.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\nMcMahon largely remained a commentator after the Bret Hart incident on ''Raw''. On September 22, 1997, on the first-ever ''Raw'' to be broadcast from [[Madison Square Garden]], Bret's brother [[Owen Hart]] was giving a speech to the fans in attendance. During his speech, Stone Cold Steve Austin entered the ring with five [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officers following and assaulted Hart. When it appeared Austin would fight the officers, McMahon ran into the ring to lecture him that he could not physically compete; at the time, Austin was recovering from a broken neck after Owen Hart [[Botch (professional wrestling)|botched]] a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] in his match against Austin at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]]. After telling McMahon that he respects the fact that he and the WWF cared, Austin attacked McMahon with a Stone Cold Stunner, leaving McMahon in shock. Austin was then arrested on charges of trespassing, assault, and assaulting a police officer. This marked the beginning of the Austin-McMahon rivalry.\n\nAt [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] in 1997, [[Bret Hart]] defended his WWF Championship against long-time rival [[Shawn Michaels]] in the main event. During the match, Michaels applied Hart's signature [[Professional wrestling holds|submission maneuver]] [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|The Sharpshooter]] on Hart. Though Hart did not submit, McMahon ordered the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] to ring the bell, thus [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Screwjob|screwing]] Hart out of the title and making Michaels the champion and making McMahon turn [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] for the first time on WWF television. This incident was subsequently dubbed the \"Montreal Screwjob\".<ref name=\"Survivor Series - Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart\" /> Following the incident, McMahon left the commentary table for good ([[Jim Ross]] replaced McMahon as lead commentator) and the Mr. McMahon character began.\n\n==== Feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin (1997\u20131999) ====\n{{main|The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporate Ministry|l1=The Corporation}}In December 1997 on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', the night after [[D-Generation X: In Your House]], McMahon talked about the behavior and attitude of [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], such as Austin having assaulted WWF Commissioner Sgt. Slaughter and commentators such as Jim Ross and McMahon himself. Mr. McMahon demanded that Austin defend his Intercontinental championship against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] in a rematch. As in the previous match, Austin used his pickup truck as a weapon against The Rock and the [[Nation of Domination]] gang. Austin decided to forfeit the title to The Rock, but instead, Austin gave The Rock a ''Stone Cold Stunner'' and knocked McMahon off the ring ropes.\n\nOn the January 19, 1998 episode of Raw Is War, McMahon called [[Mike Tyson]] to the ring for a major announcement. Before McMahon could make the announcement (that Tyson would serve as a ringside enforcer at [[Wrestlemania XIV]] for the WWE World title match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Shawn Michaels) Austin interrupted and confronted Tyson culminating with Austin displaying his middle finger right in Tyson's face. Tyson shoved Austin at which point WWE security and Tyson's entourage intervened and separated both men. McMahon was incensed by Austin's actions screaming \"YOU RUINED IT\" and had to be held back from attacking Austin himself.\n\nOn the March 2 edition of Raw Is War, Mike Tyson joined [[D-Generation X]], led by WWE World Champion Shawn Michaels. A week later, Austin called out McMahon incensed by Tyson's alignment with Michaels. Austin verbally abused McMahon and attempted to provoke an agitated McMahon into hitting him (Austin) but McMahon left. On the following episode of Raw Is War, McMahon claimed he hadn't hit Austin on the previous episode of Raw as he didn't want to ruin the Wrestlemania XIV main event. Asked to explain what this meant, McMahon stated Austin would be unable to compete with a broken jaw. After initial attempts to dodge the question of whether he wanted Austin to become WWF Champion, McMahon finally answered with \"it's not just a \"no\", it's an OH HELL NO\" mimicking Austin's \"hell yeah\" catchphrase. McMahon didn't get involved during the Wrestlemania XIV main event during which Mike Tyson turned on Shawn Michaels and assisted Austin in becoming WWE Champion.\n\nOn the March 30 ''Raw Is War'', the night after Austin won the WWF title at WrestleMania XIV, McMahon presented him with a new title belt and warned Austin that he did not approve of his rebellious nature. Austin responded by delivering the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' to McMahon for the second time. On the April 13 episode of Raw Is War, it appeared Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a no-contest when [[Mick Foley|Dude Love]] interfered. This marked the first time since June 10, 1996, that [[Monday Night Wars|''Raw'' beat WCW's ''Nitro'' in the ratings]]. This led to a title match between Love and Austin at [[Unforgiven: In Your House|Unforgiven]], for which McMahon sat ringside and attempted to assist Love in winning the match. Love ultimately did win by disqualification when Austin hit McMahon with a chair. Austin retained the title which couldn't change hands by disqualification under regular match rules. In a title rematch at [[Over the Edge: In Your House]], Austin again retained, despite McMahon being the referee and his \"Corporate Stooges\", [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], as timekeeper and ring announcer, respectively. While McMahon was incapacitated by an accidental Love chair shot, Austin delivered the ''Stone Cold Stunner'' to Love and used McMahon's hand to count his pinfall victory.\n\nIn the fall of 1998, McMahon said he was \"damn sick and tired\" of seeing Stone Cold Steve Austin as the WWF Champion and developed a \"master plan\" to remove the championship from Austin. By employing the services of [[The Brothers of Destruction|The Undertaker and Kane]], McMahon set up a triple threat match for the WWF championship at [[Breakdown: In Your House]], in which Undertaker and Kane could only win by pinning Austin. At Breakdown, Austin lost the title after being pinned simultaneously by both Undertaker and Kane. However, no new champion was crowned. The following night on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', McMahon attempted to announce a new WWF Champion. He held a presentation ceremony and introduced The Undertaker and Kane. After saying that both deserved to be the WWF Champion, Austin drove a [[Ice resurfacer|Zamboni]] into the arena and attacked McMahon before police officers stopped him, and arrested him. Because The Undertaker and Kane both failed to defend McMahon from Austin, McMahon did not name a new champion, but instead made a match at [[WWE Judgment Day#1998|Judgment Day]] between The Undertaker and Kane with Austin as the [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special referee]]. This prompted The Undertaker and Kane to attack Mr. McMahon, injuring his ankle because he gave them the [[Finger (gesture)|finger]] behind their backs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/980928.html|title=WWF RAW is WAR 28.9.98|first=Christopher|last=Zimmerman|publisher=Slash Wrestling|accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref>\n\nAt Judgement Day, there was still no champion crowned as Austin declared himself the winner after counting a double pinfall three count for both men. McMahon ordered the WWF Championship to be defended in a [[Professional wrestling tournament|14-man tournament]] named [[Survivor Series (1998)#Tournaments bracket|Deadly Games]] at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]] in 1998. McMahon made sure that [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] reached the finals because Mankind had visited McMahon in the hospital after McMahon was sent to the hospital by the [[The Brothers of Destruction|Undertaker and Kane]].<ref name=\"Survivor Series - The Rock vs Mankind\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1998/1998/|title=Survivor Series 1998 main event|accessdate=January 15, 2008|publisher=WWE}}</ref> He also awarded Mankind the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Championship]] due to his status as a [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore wrestling legend]].

Stephanie played an \"innocent sweet girl\" who was kidnapped by The Ministry twice. The first time she was kidnapped, she was found by [[Ken Shamrock]] on behalf of McMahon in a basement of the stadium. The second time she was kidnapped, The Undertaker attempted to marry her whilst she was forcefully tied to the Ministry's crucifix, but she was saved by Steve Austin. This angle saw a brief friendship develop between McMahon and Austin, cooling their long-running feud. McMahon became a member of the short-lived stable [[The Union (professional wrestling)|The Union]], during May 1999. McMahon's son Shane merged the Corporation with Undertaker's Ministry of Darkness to form the [[Corporate Ministry]]. On the June 7 episode of ''Raw Is War'', McMahon was revealed as the \"Higher Power\" behind the Corporate Ministry.

He had decided to vacate the title during the following Monday's ''Raw Is War'' because he was not allowed on WWF TV because of the stipulations of the Fully Loaded 1999 contract he signed. However, Stone Cold Steve Austin reinstated him in return for a WWF title shot. Over the next few months, McMahon and Triple H feuded, with the linchpin of the feud being Triple H's storyline marriage to Stephanie McMahon.

McMahon's Million Dollar Mania lasted just three weeks and was suspended after the 3-hour Draft episode of ''Raw'' on June 23. After giving away $500,000, explosions tore apart the ''Raw'' stage, which fell and collapsed on top of McMahon. On June 30, Shane addressed the WWE audience before ''Raw'', informing the fans that his family had chosen to keep his father's condition private. He also urged the WWE roster to stand together during what he described as a \"turbulent time\".

On the January 19 ''Raw'', McMahon returned, as a face, and supported his daughter's decision on Jericho, but Stephanie rehired him. [[Randy Orton]] then came out and assaulted McMahon after harassing Stephanie. McMahon returned on the March 30 ''Raw'' with his son, Shane, and son-in-law Triple H to confront Orton. The night after [[WrestleMania XXV]], McMahon appeared on ''Raw'' to announce Orton would not receive another championship opportunity at [[Backlash (2009)|Backlash]], but compete in a six-man tag team match with his [[The Legacy (professional wrestling)|Legacy]] stablemates against Triple H, Shane McMahon and himself. ''Raw'' General Manager [[Vickie Guerrero]] made the match for the WWE Championship. Orton then challenged McMahon to a match that night, in which Legacy assaulted him, and Orton also hitting him with the RKO. After being assisted by Triple H, Shane and a returning Batista, McMahon announced Batista would replace him in the match at Backlash. On the June 15 ''Raw'', McMahon announced that he had sold the ''Raw'' brand to businessman Donald Trump. The next week, during the ''Trump is Raw'' show, McMahon bought the brand back from Trump. On the June 29 ''Raw'', McMahon announced that every week, a celebrity guest host would control ''Raw'' for the night. He soon appeared on ''SmackDown'', putting [[Theodore Long]] on probation for his actions. On August 24 ''Raw'', McMahon had a birthday bash which was interrupted by The Legacy, and competed in a six-man tag team match with his long-time rival team [[D-Generation X|DX]], in which they won after the interference of [[John Cena]]. He continued to appear on ''SmackDown'', making occasional matches and reminding Long that he is still on probation. On the November 16 ''Raw'', McMahon was called out by guest host [[Roddy Piper]], who wanted a match with McMahon that night in [[Madison Square Garden]].

The two appeared to finally bury the hatchet, but after shaking hands, Vince kicked Hart in the groin and left the arena to a loud chorus of boos and the crowd chanting \"You screwed Bret! You screwed Bret!\".<ref name=\"us.wwe.com\"/> A match was then booked between the two at [[WrestleMania XXVI]], which saw Hart defeat McMahon in a No Holds Barred Lumberjack match. On the May 31 ''Raw'', McMahon returned to congratulate Hart on becoming the new Raw General Manager. On the June 22 ''Raw'', McMahon fired Hart for not dealing with ''[[WWE NXT (TV series)|NXT]]'' season one rookies, known as [[Nexus (professional wrestling)|The Nexus]]. That same night, he announced the new General Manager would be anonymous and make decisions via emails, which would be read by [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]. The General Manager's first decision was McMahon to be the guest referee for a WWE Championship match that night between John Cena and [[Sheamus]]. The match was interrupted by The Nexus who then attacked McMahon. McMahon appeared in a segment on the November 1 ''Raw'', in a coma from the attack by The Nexus. He woke up and his doctor ([[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]) explained what had happened since he had been out. The scene transitioned to Stephanie McMahon waking up, revealing [[Dream sequence|it was all a dream]].\n\n==== Sporadic appearances (2011\u2013present) ====\nIn early 2011, McMahon once again stepped away from WWE storylines to focus on both his corporate and backstage duties.\n\nOn the June 27 episode of ''Raw'', [[CM Punk]] made a scathing on-air speech criticizing WWE and McMahon about the way WWE was run. McMahon suspended Punk but reinstated him at the behest of Punk's [[Money in the Bank (2011)|Money in the Bank]] opponent, WWE Champion John Cena. At the pay-per-view, McMahon and Vice President of Talent Relations [[John Laurinaitis]] interfered on Cena's behalf but Punk was ultimately successful and walked out of the company with the championship. On the following ''Raw'', Triple H returned and, on behalf of WWE's board of directors, fired McMahon from his position of running ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'', though leaving him chairman of the board. Triple H then announced he had been designated Chief Operating Officer of WWE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-07-18/mcmahon-relieved-of-duties|title=McMahon Released |accessdate=July 16, 2011|publisher=WWE.com}}</ref> McMahon returned on the October 10 ''Raw'', firing Triple H from running ''Raw'', stating the board of directors had called Triple H a financial catastrophe, and that the [[List of WWE personnel|WWE employees]] had voted [[Motion of no confidence|no confidence]] in him the previous week.

After a conflict with Cena and Big Show that saw McMahon accidentally knocked out by Big Show, McMahon declared that if Big Show lost his match at [[No Way Out (2012)|No Way Out]], Laurinaitis would be fired. Cena defeated Big Show in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]], and McMahon fired Laurinaitis. McMahon announced [[AJ Lee|AJ]] as ''Raw''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s new general manager at ''[[WWE Raw 1000|Raw 1000]]'' and made Booker T SmackDown's new general manager on August 3 episode of ''SmackDown''. After CM Punk interrupted him on the October 8 episode of ''Raw'', he challenged Punk to a match, threatening to fire him if he declined. The match did not officially start, but McMahon held his own in a brawl with Punk until Punk attempted the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Go to Sleep|GTS]]. Ryback and Cena interfered and McMahon ultimately booked Punk in a match with Ryback at [[Hell in a Cell (2012)|Hell in a Cell]].\n\nDuring the buildup for the [[Royal Rumble (2013)|2013 Royal Rumble]], McMahon told CM Punk that if [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|The Shield]] interfered in his match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], Punk would forfeit his title. During the match, the lights went out and Rock was attacked by what appeared to be The Shield, leading to Rock's loss.

This prompted Owens to say Shane put his hands on him, but McMahon said he suspended Shane for not finishing off Owens. Shane was then reinstated to face Owens at the ''Hell in a Cell'' pay-per-view.

This angle marked the first time that McMahon physically interjected himself into a match, as he occasionally tripped and punched at Lawler while seated ringside. During the angle, McMahon was not acknowledged as the owner of the WWF, and the feud was not acknowledged on WWF television, as the two continued to provide commentary together (along with [[Randy Savage]]) for the television show ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]''.
