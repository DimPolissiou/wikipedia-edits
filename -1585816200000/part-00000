P. Herbert''' or simply '''A. P. H.''', was an English humorist,<!-- THIS REALLY IS THE O.E.D. SPELLING--> novelist, playwright and [[law reform]] activist who served as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University]] from the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] to the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], when [[university constituencies]] were abolished.\n\nBorn in Ashtead, Surrey, Herbert attended [[Winchester College]] and [[New College, Oxford]], graduating with a first in [[Jurisprudence]] in 1914. He joined the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] as an ordinary seaman after the outbreak of [[World War I]], later serving as an officer with the [[63rd (Royal Naval) Division|Royal Naval Division]]. He fought in the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli campaign]] and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], becoming his battalion's [[adjutant]] in 1917, following which he was injured and did not return to the frontline before the end of the war. Following the war, he published ''[[The Secret Battle]]'' and joined the permanent staff of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1924. He also wrote the [[libretto]]s for several musicals.\n\nHerbert was elected as the Independent MP for Oxford University in the 1935 general election. Before the outbreak of World War II, Herbert campaigned for private member's rights, piloted the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937]] through Parliament, opposed the Entertainments Duty and campaigned against the [[Oxford Group]]. He enlisted in the River Emergency Service in 1938 and served in [[World War II]] as a Petty Officer in the Royal Naval Auxiliary Patrol. He captained his river boat, the ''Water Gipsy'', assigned to the [[River Thames]]. In 1943, he was part of a parliamentary commission sent to investigate the future of the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nHerbert was born at Ashtead Lodge, [[Ashtead]], Surrey, on 24 September 1890.

H. Asquith]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] at the time. He took an active part in the College's debating society and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] society. As a student at Winchester, Herbert sent verses to the offices of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', and received notes of encouragement and suggestions from the editor, [[Owen Seaman]]. Herbert was also Captain of Houses, one of the College's three football divisions.<ref>Pound, pp. 22\u201326.</ref>\n\nFrom Winchester, Herbert went to [[New College, Oxford]] as an [[Exhibitioner]]. He made his first public speech at the Kensington branch of the [[Tariff Reform League]], speaking ''[[Ex tempore|extempore]]'' on [[home rule]]. His first contribution to ''Punch'' was printed on 24 August 1910, being a set of verses with the title \"Stones of Venus\". Herbert went up to Oxford in October, and made his first speech at the [[Oxford Union]] in November. Apart from ''Punch'', his work began appearing in ''[[The Observer]]'', the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (UK)|Vanity Fair]]''.<ref>Pound, pp. 25\u201333.</ref>\n\nHerbert received a \"not very good Second\" in [[Honour Moderations]], and, apparently disenchanted with [[Classics]], changed his degree to Law. He went into lodgings with [[Walter Monckton]] and others and was also good friends with notables [[Duff Cooper]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Philip Guedalla]]. Herbert finished at Oxford in 1914, with \"a very good First\" in [[Jurisprudence]]. He then decided to join his friend Jack Parr as a volunteer at [[Oxford House (settlement)|Oxford House]] in [[Bethnal Green]] for a year. He spent the time \"doing what I could\": washing dishes, sweeping floors, running errands and collecting money.<ref>Pound, pp. 33\u201336.</ref>\n\n==First World War service, 1914\u201318==\nOn 5 September 1914, Herbert enlisted at Lambeth Pier as an [[ordinary seaman]] in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]], which later became one of the constituent bodies of the [[Royal Naval Division]]. In early October, the news reached Herbert that his brother, Owen Herbert, had been posted \"missing, believed killed\" in the retreat from [[Battle of Mons|Mons]]. Herbert reached the rank of acting [[leading seaman]] before being commissioned as a [[sub-lieutenant]] in early 1915, when he was posted to Hawke Battalion of the Royal Naval Division (later to come under army command as part of the [[63rd (Royal Naval) Division]]).<ref>Pound, pp. 40\u201343.</ref>\n\n\"C\" and \"D\" companies of Hawke Battalion departed for [[Gallipoli]] in early 1915, briefly stopping in [[Malta]] before arriving at the [[Moudros]] on 17 May. The battalion finally arrived at Gallipoli on 27 May. Herbert was put in command of No. 11 Platoon, \"C\" Company, which was composed mostly of [[Tyneside]]rs and also two men from a remote [[Durham, England|Durham]] mining town. A week after arrival, the battalion suffered heavy casualties at the [[Third Battle of Krithia]]. In July 1915, Herbert went down with an illness and had to spend time recovering in a military hospital. When he was passed \"fit for light duty\", he was seconded to the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] at [[Whitehall]]. It was at this time that he decided to begin renting 12 [[Hammersmith Terrace]].<ref>Pound, pp. 43\u201339.</ref><ref name=\"bathe\">{{cite news|title=British war poetry: The Bathe|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-five/10542340/war-poetry-ap-herbert.html|accessdate=14 April 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=31 December 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Royal Naval Division trench.jpg|left|thumb|350x350px|Soldiers of the Royal Naval Division training to leave a trench during [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], 1915]]\nIn summer 1916, when passed fit for duty, Herbert returned to Hawke Battalion at their base camp in [[Abbeville]], where he was made assistant adjutant. The battalion moved to the front line at [[Souchez]] in July 1916, and in mid-November the battalion took part in an attack on [[Beaucourt]] during the [[Battle of the Ancre]] that saw almost the entire battalion wiped out. Herbert was one of only two officers that came out unscathed from the attack. When the battalion returned to the front line at [[Pozi\u00e8res]] in February 1917, Herbert was made the battalion's adjutant, but he was later injured from shrapnel during an attack on [[Gavrelle]], west of [[Arras]].<ref name=\"bathe\" /><ref>Pound, pp. 50\u201353.</ref>\n\nOn medical leave back in England following the injury, Herbert began writing his first book, ''[[The Secret Battle]]'', which was finished \"in a few weeks\". He was also elected a member of the Savage Club, and was raised by ''Punch'' to the \"exclusive group of its contributors who were allowed to attach their initials to their work.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 54-55</ref> On 2 October 1918, Herbert sailed out of [[Liverpool]] in a convoy bound for [[Alexandria]]. His role was as assistant to the [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]]. After arriving at Port Said, he was given a free pass to Cairo and was allowed to make a number of unaccompanied incursions inland. He was able to visit a number of places on the North African coast, and from Tunis, he took a train to Constantine, and then to Algiers. On 11 November, he went by train from Oran to Tlemcen. Exactly at 11 am, he heard that the Armistice had been signed. He wrote that \"I must have been the only Englishman for at least 80 miles.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 57\u201359.</ref>\n\nHe was granted shore leave at [[Gibraltar]] and took the opportunity to travel to [[Seville]] and then to [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He arrived in [[Madrid]] on 22 November and dined with the embassy's naval attache, Captain John Harvey, as well as [[Filson Young]] and others before making the return journey to Gibraltar.<ref>Pound, pp. 60\u201361.</ref>\n\n==Interwar career, 1918\u201335==\n''[[The Secret Battle]]'' was recommended to [[Methuen Publishing]] by [[E. V. Lucas]] and was announced in their spring list in 1919. The book was \"read all night\" by [[Lloyd George]], the Prime Minister, who also brought it to the attention of [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], then [[Secretary of State for War]]. [[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]] considered it \"the best story of front line war\", and Herbert himself believed that court martial arrangements were subsequently \"altered in some way\" as a result of the book. However, the book was not a great commercial success, which his biographer Reginald Pound puts down to the fact that \"Readers, it seems, were tired of war as a dramatic theme.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 64\u201364.</ref>\n\nHerbert was [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]] by [[Inner Temple]] in 1919 and entered the chambers of [[Leslie Scott (British politician)|Leslie Scott]]. He was joined by two of his Oxford friends, [[Walter Monckton, 1st Viscount Monckton of Brenchley|Walter Monckton]] and [[Henry Strauss, 1st Baron Conesford|Henry Strauss]], who were called on the same day. Although he spent some time at Inner Temple, he never practised law and did not enter a legal career. He later declared himself \"forever sorry\" that he was \"not of the proud and faithful brotherhood who serve the laws of England.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nUnable to sustain himself on ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''{{'}}s \"eccentric rates of payment\", Herbert wrote his second book, ''The House by the River'', in two months, and it was published in 1920. He handed his literary business to A. P. Watt, who sold the American rights to ''The House by the River'' and also published a collection of his prose submissions to ''Punch'' under the title ''Light Articles Only''.<ref>Pound, pp. 66\u201367.</ref>\n\nIn January 1924, [[Owen Seaman]], the editor of ''Punch'', invited Herbert to join their staff. Herbert accepted and his accession to the staff meant he would receive a salary of \u00a350 a week. In 1925, Herbert attended the Third Imperial Press Conference on behalf of ''Punch'', where he made his first speech in front of a large audience in [[Melbourne]], where it was described as \"delectably witty\" by [[Harry Brittain|Sir Harry Brittain]].<ref>Pound, pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nIn 1926, Herbert was invited by [[Nigel Playfair]] to write \"an entertainment\" for the [[Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith)|Lyric Theatre]], Hammersmith. The result was ''Riverside Nights'', performed at the Lyric in April 1926. His next play, ''The White Witch'', was performed at [[Haymarket Theatre]] in September 1926.\n\n[[File:Alan Herbert Blue Plaque Hammersmith Terrace 01.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 12 [[Hammersmith Terrace]]]]\n\n==Early parliamentary career, 1935\u201339==\nHerbert first encountered Parliament in 1934, when he brought the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons to court for selling liquor without a licence. [[Gordon Hewart, 1st Viscount Hewart|Hewart, LCJ,]] ruled that the court would not hear the complaint because the matter fell within [[parliamentary privilege]]. Since the decision was never challenged in a higher court, this has led to the unique situation where there has been uncertainty as to \"the extent to which statute law applies to either House of Parliament.\"<ref name=privilege>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Privilege \u2013 Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201314/jtselect/jtprivi/30/3010.htm|website=Parliament|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref> When, the next year, Herbert published ''[[Uncommon Law]]'', Hewart contributed a generous introduction.\n\nHerbert first entertained the thought of standing for Parliament a few weeks before the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], when he ran into [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]], who had just been rejected as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate for [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University]]. Herbert decided to stand as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] candidate, aided by [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Frank Pakenham]] who served as his [[election agent]]. Herbert wrote an \"unconventional\", 5,000-word-long [[election address]], which included: \"Agriculture: I know nothing about agriculture.\"<ref name=seatrobe>{{cite web|last1=Seatrobe |first1=J.

He protested to the Prime Minister, [[Stanley Baldwin|Baldwin]], on a motion that would give precedence to government bills over [[private member's bill]]s. He went into the \"No\" lobby alongside the members of the [[Independent Labour Party]] and fellow university member [[Eleanor Rathbone]], but the motion was passed by 232 to 5.<ref>Pound, pp. 135\u201336.</ref> Churchill praised Herbert for his \"composure and aplomb\", and also famously said: \"Call that a maiden speech? It was a brazen hussy of a speech. Never did such a painted lady of a speech parade itself before a modest Parliament.\"<ref>Herbert, p. 38.</ref> During his speech, Herbert promised to introduce his [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937|Matrimonial Causes Bill]] into law by the end of the parliament.<ref name=seatrobe />\n\nIn 1936, Herbert failed to get drawn in the private members' ballot but managed to get the Conservative [[Rupert De la B\u00e8re]] to sponsor the bill. On 20 November, Herbert made a speech in its favour and it passed its second reading by 78 votes to 12. It was given a third reading in the House of Lords on 19 July 1937 and was passed by 79 votes to 28. It was passed, somewhat strengthened by the House of Lords, in 1938 as the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937]]. This allowed divorce without requiring proof of [[adultery]], although fake adulteries and the bizarre rules about collusion persisted until the [[Divorce Reform Act 1969]] came into force in 1971.\n\nDuring the pre-war period, Herbert drafted a number of bills that were printed on the Order Paper, including a Betting and Bookmakers Bill, a Public Refreshment Bill and a Spring (Arrangements) Bill, which was written in verse.<ref>Herbert, pp. 41\u201342.</ref> Herbert made numerous attacks on the Entertainments Duty, which had been introduced as a \"temporary, war-time tax\" in 1916.<ref>Herbert, p. 91.</ref> In his campaign against the duty, Herbert worked closely with [[William Mabane, 1st Baron Mabane|William Mabane]], and they made some headway when in 1939 the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] reduced the duty.<ref>Herbert, p. 95.</ref> Herbert also spoke out against the proposed Population (Statistics) Bill in 1937, making a speech that was received with \"loud laughter\" in the Commons chamber, making it, according to ''Punch'', \"an astonishing occasion\". Herbert and others brought in several amendments to the bill before it reached the statute book in 1938.<ref>Pound, pp. 151\u201353.</ref>\n\nHerbert was also a fervent opponent of the [[Oxford Group]] and its leader, [[Frank Buchman]]. In particular, he opposed the use of \"Oxford\" in their name and their supposed association with the [[University of Oxford]]. He was supported by the University in his endeavours, particularly by the [[Oxford Union]], which unanimously passed a resolution in support of Herbert. [[H. A. L. Fisher]], the warden of [[New College, Oxford]], and [[Douglas Veale]], the [[Registrar of the University of Oxford]], also expressed their support to Herbert.<ref>Pound, pp. 155\u201356.</ref>\n\n==Second World War service, 1939\u201345==\nOn 3 November 1938, Herbert enrolled himself and his boat, the ''Water Gipsy'', in the River Emergency Service, which was under the control of the [[Port of London Authority]].<ref>Herbert, p. 113.</ref> Over the summer of 1939, he had taken part in exercises involving simulated air raid and casualty retrieval. In early September 1939, the River Emergency Service reported to their war stations, and Herbert's own crew consisted of Darcy Braddell, vice-president of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], [[Victor Pasmore]], [[Magnus Pyke]] and [[John Pudney]]. At the sounding of the first air raid siren in London in 1939, the ''Water Gipsy'' was anchored off Speaker's Steps by Westminster Bridge. A number of MPs left the Commons following the sirens and cheered the ''Water Gipsy'' as the only naval vessel in sight, before saluting it.<ref>Pound, pp. 158\u201359.</ref>\n\nDuring the Second World War, Herbert was the only [[non-commissioned officer]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and wore his uniform on any and every occasion during the war years. He turned down efforts to persuade him to apply for a commission, despite once appearing before a selection board against his will. He also turned down the offer of a role in Churchill's [[Churchill war ministry|war cabinet]] when asked, saying \"No, thank you, sir. I'm quite happy where I am.\"<ref>Pound, p. 178.</ref>\n\nHe was sent to [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1943 with [[Derrick Gunston]] and [[Charles Ammon, 1st Baron Ammon|Charles Ammon]] as part of a parliamentary commission to investigate the future of the dominion. Of the alternatives, he supported independence rather than a confederation.\n\n==Later parliamentary career, 1945\u201350==\nFollowing his re-election in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] on 5 July, Herbert noted of the new Parliament that \"the surge of Socialism into the House of Commons was something to see.\" The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], under [[Clement Attlee]], had won 393 seats, and the Conservatives had won only 197. Herbert said of the newly elected Labour MPs that \"Arrogance, I am sorry to say, remained. There was such a concerto of nastiness and hate and imbecile yelling, that I thanked God, many times, that I was an Independent and could be silent without disloyalty.\" Herbert campaigned to ensure that the newly elected MPs realised the significance of private members' time. He prepared a number of private member's bills, including on betting reform, legal aid for the poor, a fairer voting system, and the abolition of [[decree nisi]], among other things. However, he was unsuccessful in his first attempt to guarantee private members' time \u2013 later in the Parliament, it would be restored.<ref>Pound, pp. 197\u201398.</ref>\n\nIn autumn 1945, [[George Orwell]] had the essay ''[[Notes on Nationalism]]'' published in the magazine ''[[Polemic (magazine)|Polemic]]''. In it, he named Herbert as one of the followers of \"neo-Toryism\", who, according to Orwell, are marked by a \"desire not to recognise that British power and influence have declined\".<ref name=\"orwell\">{{cite web|url=http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat|title=Notes on Nationalism|website=Orwell.ru|last1=Orwell|first1=George|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> Herbert's biographer, Reginald Pound, notes that \"APH would have rejected the Tory affiliation, though his inclinations were with the Right.\"<ref>Pound, p. 208.</ref>\n\nFrom July 1945 through to 1946, Herbert worked on the [[libretto]] for [[Charles B. Cochran]]'s new musical, ''Big Ben''. It opened at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] on 17 July 1946 and was watched on its opening night by Churchill, [[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]], Attlee and Herbert, but Cochran was too ill to attend. During its first three months, it took an average of \u00a34,000 a week at the box office, but the running costs were also high so there was no fortune for Cochran or Herbert.<ref>Pound, pp. 199\u2013201.</ref> The show ended its run at the end of 1946, after 172 performances.<ref>Pound, p. 207.</ref> Cochran commissioned Herbert to write another musical, ''[[Bless the Bride]]'', which opened at the Adelphi on 26 April 1947. It ran for two and a quarter years, and was the source of \"an accretion of cash\" for Herbert as well as being Cochran's most successful musical.<ref>Pound, p. 211.</ref>\n\nHerbert sat on the Supreme Court Committee on Practice and Procedures, chaired by [[Raymond Evershed, 1st Baron Evershed|Raymond Evershed]], which was investigating the cost of litigation. He also chaired the Literary Sub-Committee of the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London, which judged the literary compositions of 29 nations in their own languages. He also accepted an invitation to serve on the Council of the [[Festival of Britain]], to be held in 1951. At this time, he was already a member of the [[Thames Conservancy|Thames Conservancy Board]], a trustee of the [[National Maritime Museum]], president of the [[Inland Waterways Association]] and a vice president of the [[Living Streets (UK)|Pedestrians' Association for Road Safety]]. He also authored a critical study of [[Royal Commission|royal commissions]] for the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], which was dismissed for its \"light touch\". Herbert commented that \"Had it included graphs and tables and been written in a heavy style it would have been accepted as a major contribution to the practice of sound administration.\"<ref>Pound, p. 212\u201314</ref>\n\nHerbert was re-elected in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] and continued as an MP until the [[University constituency|University seats]] were abolished in 1950 as a result of the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]].<ref>Herbert, p. 31.</ref> Herbert's last speech, on 23 November 1949, was in favour of the [[Festival of Britain]], a cause he strongly supported.<ref name=\"seatrobe\" /> He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1945 in [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[1945 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37227 |supp=y |pages=4183\u20134184  |date=14 August 1945 }}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' noted \"his individual niche in the parliamentary temple as the doughty vindicator of the private member's rights, including not least the right to legislate.\"<ref>{{citation |title=none|newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=14 August 1945 |page=5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Herbert published a memoir of his service in the House of Commons, ''Independent Member'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Co., Inc., 1951).\n\nHerbert was the subject of a ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' TV programme in 1961 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]].\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Hammersmith Terrace 07.JPG|thumb|12 Hammersmith Terrace]]\nIn the summer of 1914, Herbert first met his future wife, Gwendolyn Harriet Quilter, the daughter of [[Harry Quilter]].<ref>Pound, p. 37.</ref> They became engaged in December 1914 and were married in the first week of 1915 by [[Frederic Iremonger]], the vicar of St James the Great in [[Bethnal Green]]. Herbert wore his formal dress uniform of an Acting Leading Seaman during the wedding. They spent their honeymoon in a room in [[Fulham Road]].<ref>Pound, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Gwendolyn lived to the age of 97, dying in 1986. Lady Herbert was elected as the first President of Hammersmith Chess Club <ref>[http://hammerchess.co.uk Chess Club site]</ref> in 1966 and was a well-known face on the chess circuit at that time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hammerchess.co.uk/2016/03/18/a-brief-history-of-hammersmith-chess-club/ |title=A Brief History of Hammersmith Chess Club \u2013 Hammersmith Chess Club}}</ref> They had four children Crystal, Lavender, [[Jocelyn Herbert|Jocelyn]] and John.\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] Member of Parliament for [[Chesterfield]], [[Toby Perkins]], is his great-grandson.\n\n===The Thames===\nHerbert loved the [[River Thames]]. He lived beside it at [[Hammersmith]], West London. He was a Conservator (a member of the [[Thames Conservancy Board]]) and a Freeman of the [[Lightermen|Company of Watermen and Lightermen]]. In 1966 he wrote ''The Thames'' ([[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]) in which he explored the \"machinery\" of the river in all its aspects.\n\n==Death==\nIn the last days of 1970, Herbert was taken to [[Middlesex Hospital]] in [[Fitzrovia]], following a seizure that affected his left side and arm. Within six weeks, he was home again, and over many months his physical powers waned. In August 1971, he wrote his last letter to ''The Times'', an appeal for parliamentary good manners in refraining from \"witty derision of the literary exertions of Mr [[Harold Wilson]]\" and of the \"marine activities\" of [[Edward Heath]]. By then, he was describing himself as \"a recumbent nuisance.\" He died on 11 November 1971, and obituaries were published in both ''The Times'' and ''Punch''. ''The Times'' supplemented their obituary notice with a leading article. They described him as having done \"more than any man of his day to add to the gaiety of the nation.\"<ref name=death />\n\nA memorial service was held on 6 December in the church of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], which was \"crowded to overflowing\". On 7 December, the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' of the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] appeared with four pages of tributes to Herbert, by congressmen from Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Robert H. Land, chief of the Reference Department of the [[Library of Congress]], later said that \"[there is no] record or recollection of a similar tribute to another English writer in the proceedings of Congress.\"<ref name=death>Pound, pp. 299\u2013301.</ref>\n\n==References by other authors==\nIn his 1957 article \"Over Seventy\", lamenting the decline of the humorist, [[P.

Herbert on every street corner, an [[Alex Atkinson]] in every [[Public house|local]].\"\n\nThe title of [[Alexandra Fuller]]'s 2001 memoir ''[[Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood]]'' is taken from a Herbert quote, \"Don't let's go to the dogs tonight, for Mother will be there.\"<ref>[Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight] Cited from epigraph.</ref>\n\nIn Stella Gibbons' [[Cold Comfort Farm]], there is an exchange between Seth and Flora :  \n\n\" \u2018I goes over to Beershorn,\u2019 replied Seth, rather sulkily.

One series of his it took was ''[[Uncommon Law|Misleading Cases in the Common Law]]'' \u2013 the work for which he is best remembered. These were satirical pieces in the form of \"[[law reports]]\" or \"[[Legal judgment|judgement]]s\" on various aspects of the English legal and judicial system. Many featured the exploits of Albert Haddock, a tireless and veteran litigant. One of the best-known and most colourful is ''[[Board of Inland Revenue v Haddock]],'' also known as \"The Negotiable Cow\". Even the title is a humorous allusion to the entirely serious \"Smith's Leading Cases\". Herbert often referred to himself as \"A. P. Haddock\" in skits in ''Punch'' magazine, whether or not these had a courtroom setting.\n\nThanks to their realism, they were on several occasions mistakenly reported by newspapers both in Britain and elsewhere as factual. One of the \"cases\", supposedly establishing a novel crime of \"doing what you like\", was sharply criticised by an American [[law review]] article, whose author failed to note its entire absurdity.<ref>''Uncommon Law'', ''Rex v Haddock'': Is it a free country?, 5, pp. 24\u201329. Haddock is arrested for jumping into the [[River Thames]] from [[Hammersmith Bridge]]. When questioned to motive, Haddock replies, \"For fun\". The judge sums up: \"The appellant made the general answer that this was a free country and a man can do what he likes if he does nobody any harm.... It cannot be too clearly understood that this is ''not'' a free country, and it will be an evil day for the legal profession when it is... and least of all may they do unusual actions 'for fun'. People must not do things for fun. There is no reference to fun in any Act of Parliament.\"</ref> As such they are examples of the literary technique known as [[false document]]. And while in these fictitious law reports, the fictitious judges and lawyers regularly cited various real and venerable authorities, such as [[Henry de Bracton]], they were prone also to citing texts of Herbert's own imagination such as \"Wedderburn on Water Courses\" and \"A. Capone's Handbook for Bootleggers\".\n\nMore importantly, these cases were Herbert's vehicles for his law-reform work. Beneath their satire, they often carried cogent and sharp legal or political points that tied into his personal crusades against obsolescent legislation. Although fictional, they are, consequently, sometimes quoted in judicial decisions,<ref>See for example [http://www.securitymanagement.com/library/Messing_BankAmerica0703.pdf Messing v Bank of America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319153809/http://www.securitymanagement.com/library/Messing_BankAmerica0703.pdf |date=19 March 2006 }}(2002) at paragraph 1, and [http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/1999/214.html Victor Chandler International Ltd v The Commissioners of Custom and Excise and Teletext Limited] 1999 EWHC Ch 214, para 11, where [[Gavin Lightman (judge)|Mr Justice Lightman]] stated that a document, in the context of the [[Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981]], \"must be inanimate: neither a person nor A.

Stray cases also appear in his collections of miscellaneous humorous essays, such as ''[[General Cargo]]''. Virtually all the cases were assembled into two omnibus volumes, ''[[Uncommon Law]]'' in 1935 and ''[[More Uncommon Law]]'' in 1982. A shorter selection, ''[[Wigs at Work]]'', appeared in 1966.\n\nThe [[BBC]] successfully adapted them for television as three series of ''[[A P Herbert's Misleading Cases]]'' (1967, 1968 and 1971), with [[Roy Dotrice]] as Haddock and [[Alastair Sim]] as the judge, Mr Justice Swallow.\n\n==Novels and other writings==\nHerbert wrote eight novels, including ''[[The Water Gipsies (novel)|The Water Gipsies]]'' (1930), and 15 plays, including the light operas ''[[Tantivy Towers]]'' (1931) and ''Big Ben'' (1946), and the comedy ''[[Bless the Bride]]'' (1947), which ran for two-and-a-quarter years in London.\n\nIn addition to his fiction, Herbert wrote ''[[What a Word!]]'' in 1935, continuing his campaign in ''Punch'' for better use of English, including a section on \"Plain English\", more than a decade ahead of Sir [[Ernest Gowers]]'s more celebrated work. Characteristically, Herbert uses humour to make his serious points about good writing. He was the author of the lyrics of the patriotic song \"[[Song of Liberty]]\", set in 1940 to the music of Edward [[Elgar]]'s ''[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches|Pomp and Circumstance March No. 4]]''. In 1944, a set of posters by [[Eric Kennington]], a personal friend, called ''Seeing It Through'', were accompanied by poems by Herbert. They describe the work of certain professionals in London in the war. After the war he wrote a booklet called \"The War Story of [[Southend Pier]]\" detailing an account of when the pier was taken over by the Royal Navy in World War II.\n\nIn 1967, Herbert published ''[[Sundials Old and New; or, Fun with the Sun]]''; a book describing in detail his long fascination with, and experiments in, sundial technology. In the book, he describes all manner of sundials, and recounts many of his experiments in designing and building a number of different models, including a few that could be used to tell your position on the earth as well as the local time.\n\nIn 1970 Herbert published ''[[A.P.H., His Life and Times]]'', dedicated to \"My dear wife, for our 56th anniversary\".\n\n==Selected filmography==\n*''[[Tell England (film)|Tell England]]'' (1931)\n*''[[Waltz Time (1933 film)|Waltz Time]]'' (1933)\n\n==Publications==\n===General===\n*''[[The Secret Battle]]'', 1919, Methuen (A novel about a soldier executed for cowardice.)\n*''[[The House by the River]]'', 1921, Methuen (A novel about a war poet who commits a murder.)

P. Herbert''' or simply '''A. P. H.''', was an English humorist,<!-- THIS REALLY IS THE O.E.D. SPELLING--> novelist, playwright and [[law reform]] activist who served as an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University]] from the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] to the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], when [[university constituencies]] were abolished.\n\nBorn in Ashtead, Surrey, Herbert attended [[Winchester College]] and [[New College, Oxford]], graduating with a first in [[Jurisprudence]] in 1914. He joined the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] as an ordinary seaman after the outbreak of [[World War I]], later serving as an officer with the [[63rd (Royal Naval) Division|Royal Naval Division]]. He fought in the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli campaign]] and on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], becoming his battalion's [[adjutant]] in 1917, following which he was injured and did not return to the frontline before the end of the war. Following the war, he published ''[[The Secret Battle]]'' and joined the permanent staff of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1924. He also wrote the [[libretto]]s for several musicals.\n\nHerbert was elected as the Independent MP for Oxford University in the 1935 general election. Before the outbreak of World War II, Herbert campaigned for private member's rights, piloted the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937]] through Parliament, opposed the Entertainments Duty and campaigned against the [[Oxford Group]]. He enlisted in the River Emergency Service in 1938 and served in [[World War II]] as a Petty Officer in the Royal Naval Auxiliary Patrol. He captained his river boat, the ''Water Gipsy'', assigned to the [[River Thames]]. In 1943, he was part of a parliamentary commission sent to investigate the future of the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nHerbert was born at Ashtead Lodge, [[Ashtead]], Surrey, on 24 September 1890.

H. Asquith]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] at the time. He took an active part in the College's debating society and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] society. As a student at Winchester, Herbert sent verses to the offices of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'', and received notes of encouragement and suggestions from the editor, [[Owen Seaman]]. Herbert was also Captain of Houses, one of the College's three football divisions.<ref>Pound, pp. 22\u201326.</ref>\n\nFrom Winchester, Herbert went to [[New College, Oxford]] as an [[Exhibitioner]]. He made his first public speech at the Kensington branch of the [[Tariff Reform League]], speaking ''[[Ex tempore|extempore]]'' on [[home rule]]. His first contribution to ''Punch'' was printed on 24 August 1910, being a set of verses with the title \"Stones of Venus\". Herbert went up to Oxford in October, and made his first speech at the [[Oxford Union]] in November. Apart from ''Punch'', his work began appearing in ''[[The Observer]]'', the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' and ''[[Vanity Fair (UK)|Vanity Fair]]''.<ref>Pound, pp. 25\u201333.</ref>\n\nHerbert received a \"not very good Second\" in [[Honour Moderations]], and, apparently disenchanted with [[Classics]], changed his degree to Law. He went into lodgings with [[Walter Monckton]] and others and was also good friends with notables [[Duff Cooper]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Philip Guedalla]]. Herbert finished at Oxford in 1914, with \"a very good First\" in [[Jurisprudence]]. He then decided to join his friend Jack Parr as a volunteer at [[Oxford House (settlement)|Oxford House]] in [[Bethnal Green]] for a year. He spent the time \"doing what I could\": washing dishes, sweeping floors, running errands and collecting money.<ref>Pound, pp. 33\u201336.</ref>\n\n==First World War service, 1914\u201318==\nOn 5 September 1914, Herbert enlisted at Lambeth Pier as an [[ordinary seaman]] in the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]], which later became one of the constituent bodies of the [[Royal Naval Division]]. In early October, the news reached Herbert that his brother, Owen Herbert, had been posted \"missing, believed killed\" in the retreat from [[Battle of Mons|Mons]]. Herbert reached the rank of acting [[leading seaman]] before being commissioned as a [[sub-lieutenant]] in early 1915, when he was posted to Hawke Battalion of the Royal Naval Division (later to come under army command as part of the [[63rd (Royal Naval) Division]]).<ref>Pound, pp. 40\u201343.</ref>\n\n\"C\" and \"D\" companies of Hawke Battalion departed for [[Gallipoli]] in early 1915, briefly stopping in [[Malta]] before arriving at the [[Moudros]] on 17 May. The battalion finally arrived at Gallipoli on 27 May. Herbert was put in command of No. 11 Platoon, \"C\" Company, which was composed mostly of [[Tyneside]]rs and also two men from a remote [[Durham, England|Durham]] mining town. A week after arrival, the battalion suffered heavy casualties at the [[Third Battle of Krithia]]. In July 1915, Herbert went down with an illness and had to spend time recovering in a military hospital. When he was passed \"fit for light duty\", he was seconded to the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] at [[Whitehall]]. It was at this time that he decided to begin renting 12 [[Hammersmith Terrace]].<ref>Pound, pp. 43\u201339.</ref><ref name=\"bathe\">{{cite news|title=British war poetry: The Bathe|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/inside-first-world-war/part-five/10542340/war-poetry-ap-herbert.html|accessdate=14 April 2016|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=31 December 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Royal Naval Division trench.jpg|left|thumb|350x350px|Soldiers of the Royal Naval Division training to leave a trench during [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], 1915]]\nIn summer 1916, when passed fit for duty, Herbert returned to Hawke Battalion at their base camp in [[Abbeville]], where he was made assistant adjutant. The battalion moved to the front line at [[Souchez]] in July 1916, and in mid-November the battalion took part in an attack on [[Beaucourt]] during the [[Battle of the Ancre]] that saw almost the entire battalion wiped out. Herbert was one of only two officers that came out unscathed from the attack. When the battalion returned to the front line at [[Pozi\u00e8res]] in February 1917, Herbert was made the battalion's adjutant, but he was later injured from shrapnel during an attack on [[Gavrelle]], west of [[Arras]].<ref name=\"bathe\" /><ref>Pound, pp. 50\u201353.</ref>\n\nOn medical leave back in England following the injury, Herbert began writing his first book, ''[[The Secret Battle]]'', which was finished \"in a few weeks\". He was also elected a member of the Savage Club, and was raised by ''Punch'' to the \"exclusive group of its contributors who were allowed to attach their initials to their work.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 54-55</ref> On 2 October 1918, Herbert sailed out of [[Liverpool]] in a convoy bound for [[Alexandria]]. His role was as assistant to the [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]]. After arriving at Port Said, he was given a free pass to Cairo and was allowed to make a number of unaccompanied incursions inland. He was able to visit a number of places on the North African coast, and from Tunis, he took a train to Constantine, and then to Algiers. On 11 November, he went by train from Oran to Tlemcen. Exactly at 11 am, he heard that the Armistice had been signed. He wrote that \"I must have been the only Englishman for at least 80 miles.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 57\u201359.</ref>\n\nHe was granted shore leave at [[Gibraltar]] and took the opportunity to travel to [[Seville]] and then to [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He arrived in [[Madrid]] on 22 November and dined with the embassy's naval attache, Captain John Harvey, as well as [[Filson Young]] and others before making the return journey to Gibraltar.<ref>Pound, pp. 60\u201361.</ref>\n\n==Interwar career, 1918\u201335==\n''[[The Secret Battle]]'' was recommended to [[Methuen Publishing]] by [[E. V. Lucas]] and was announced in their spring list in 1919. The book was \"read all night\" by [[Lloyd George]], the Prime Minister, who also brought it to the attention of [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]], then [[Secretary of State for War]]. [[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]] considered it \"the best story of front line war\", and Herbert himself believed that court martial arrangements were subsequently \"altered in some way\" as a result of the book. However, the book was not a great commercial success, which his biographer Reginald Pound puts down to the fact that \"Readers, it seems, were tired of war as a dramatic theme.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 64\u201364.</ref>\n\nHerbert was [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]] by [[Inner Temple]] in 1919 and entered the chambers of [[Leslie Scott (British politician)|Leslie Scott]]. He was joined by two of his Oxford friends, [[Walter Monckton, 1st Viscount Monckton of Brenchley|Walter Monckton]] and [[Henry Strauss, 1st Baron Conesford|Henry Strauss]], who were called on the same day. Although he spent some time at Inner Temple, he never practised law and did not enter a legal career. He later declared himself \"forever sorry\" that he was \"not of the proud and faithful brotherhood who serve the laws of England.\"<ref>Pound, pp. 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nUnable to sustain himself on ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''{{'}}s \"eccentric rates of payment\", Herbert wrote his second book, ''The House by the River'', in two months, and it was published in 1920. He handed his literary business to A. P. Watt, who sold the American rights to ''The House by the River'' and also published a collection of his prose submissions to ''Punch'' under the title ''Light Articles Only''.<ref>Pound, pp. 66\u201367.</ref>\n\nIn January 1924, [[Owen Seaman]], the editor of ''Punch'', invited Herbert to join their staff. Herbert accepted and his accession to the staff meant he would receive a salary of \u00a350 a week. In 1925, Herbert attended the Third Imperial Press Conference on behalf of ''Punch'', where he made his first speech in front of a large audience in [[Melbourne]], where it was described as \"delectably witty\" by [[Harry Brittain|Sir Harry Brittain]].<ref>Pound, pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nIn 1926, Herbert was invited by [[Nigel Playfair]] to write \"an entertainment\" for the [[Lyric Theatre (Hammersmith)|Lyric Theatre]], Hammersmith. The result was ''Riverside Nights'', performed at the Lyric in April 1926. His next play, ''The White Witch'', was performed at [[Haymarket Theatre]] in September 1926.\n\n[[File:Alan Herbert Blue Plaque Hammersmith Terrace 01.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 12 [[Hammersmith Terrace]]]]\n\n==Early parliamentary career, 1935\u201339==\nHerbert first encountered Parliament in 1934, when he brought the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons to court for selling liquor without a licence. [[Gordon Hewart, 1st Viscount Hewart|Hewart, LCJ,]] ruled that the court would not hear the complaint because the matter fell within [[parliamentary privilege]]. Since the decision was never challenged in a higher court, this has led to the unique situation where there has been uncertainty as to \"the extent to which statute law applies to either House of Parliament.\"<ref name=privilege>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary Privilege \u2013 Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201314/jtselect/jtprivi/30/3010.htm|website=Parliament|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref> When, the next year, Herbert published ''[[Uncommon Law]]'', Hewart contributed a generous introduction.\n\nHerbert first entertained the thought of standing for Parliament a few weeks before the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], when he ran into [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]], who had just been rejected as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] candidate for [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University]]. Herbert decided to stand as an [[Independent politician|Independent]] candidate, aided by [[Frank Pakenham, 7th Earl of Longford|Frank Pakenham]] who served as his [[election agent]]. Herbert wrote an \"unconventional\", 5,000-word-long [[election address]], which included: \"Agriculture: I know nothing about agriculture.\"<ref name=seatrobe>{{cite web|last1=Seatrobe |first1=J.

He protested to the Prime Minister, [[Stanley Baldwin|Baldwin]], on a motion that would give precedence to government bills over [[private member's bill]]s. He went into the \"No\" lobby alongside the members of the [[Independent Labour Party]] and fellow university member [[Eleanor Rathbone]], but the motion was passed by 232 to 5.<ref>Pound, pp. 135\u201336.</ref> Churchill praised Herbert for his \"composure and aplomb\", and also famously said: \"Call that a maiden speech? It was a brazen hussy of a speech. Never did such a painted lady of a speech parade itself before a modest Parliament.\"<ref>Herbert, p. 38.</ref> During his speech, Herbert promised to introduce his [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937|Matrimonial Causes Bill]] into law by the end of the parliament.<ref name=seatrobe />\n\nIn 1936, Herbert failed to get drawn in the private members' ballot but managed to get the Conservative [[Rupert De la B\u00e8re]] to sponsor the bill. On 20 November, Herbert made a speech in its favour and it passed its second reading by 78 votes to 12. It was given a third reading in the House of Lords on 19 July 1937 and was passed by 79 votes to 28. It was passed, somewhat strengthened by the House of Lords, in 1938 as the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1937]]. This allowed divorce without requiring proof of [[adultery]], although fake adulteries and the bizarre rules about collusion persisted until the [[Divorce Reform Act 1969]] came into force in 1971.\n\nDuring the pre-war period, Herbert drafted a number of bills that were printed on the Order Paper, including a Betting and Bookmakers Bill, a Public Refreshment Bill and a Spring (Arrangements) Bill, which was written in verse.<ref>Herbert, pp. 41\u201342.</ref> Herbert made numerous attacks on the Entertainments Duty, which had been introduced as a \"temporary, war-time tax\" in 1916.<ref>Herbert, p. 91.</ref> In his campaign against the duty, Herbert worked closely with [[William Mabane, 1st Baron Mabane|William Mabane]], and they made some headway when in 1939 the Chancellor of the Exchequer [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|Sir John Simon]] reduced the duty.<ref>Herbert, p. 95.</ref> Herbert also spoke out against the proposed Population (Statistics) Bill in 1937, making a speech that was received with \"loud laughter\" in the Commons chamber, making it, according to ''Punch'', \"an astonishing occasion\". Herbert and others brought in several amendments to the bill before it reached the statute book in 1938.<ref>Pound, pp. 151\u201353.</ref>\n\nHerbert was also a fervent opponent of the [[Oxford Group]] and its leader, [[Frank Buchman]]. In particular, he opposed the use of \"Oxford\" in their name and their supposed association with the [[University of Oxford]]. He was supported by the University in his endeavours, particularly by the [[Oxford Union]], which unanimously passed a resolution in support of Herbert. [[H. A. L. Fisher]], the warden of [[New College, Oxford]], and [[Douglas Veale]], the [[Registrar of the University of Oxford]], also expressed their support to Herbert.<ref>Pound, pp. 155\u201356.</ref>\n\n==Second World War service, 1939\u201345==\nOn 3 November 1938, Herbert enrolled himself and his boat, the ''Water Gipsy'', in the River Emergency Service, which was under the control of the [[Port of London Authority]].<ref>Herbert, p. 113.</ref> Over the summer of 1939, he had taken part in exercises involving simulated air raid and casualty retrieval. In early September 1939, the River Emergency Service reported to their war stations, and Herbert's own crew consisted of Darcy Braddell, vice-president of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]], [[Victor Pasmore]], [[Magnus Pyke]] and [[John Pudney]]. At the sounding of the first air raid siren in London in 1939, the ''Water Gipsy'' was anchored off Speaker's Steps by Westminster Bridge. A number of MPs left the Commons following the sirens and cheered the ''Water Gipsy'' as the only naval vessel in sight, before saluting it.<ref>Pound, pp. 158\u201359.</ref>\n\nDuring the Second World War, Herbert was the only [[non-commissioned officer]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and wore his uniform on any and every occasion during the war years. He turned down efforts to persuade him to apply for a commission, despite once appearing before a selection board against his will. He also turned down the offer of a role in Churchill's [[Churchill war ministry|war cabinet]] when asked, saying \"No, thank you, sir. I'm quite happy where I am.\"<ref>Pound, p. 178.</ref>\n\nHe was sent to [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] in 1943 with [[Derrick Gunston]] and [[Charles Ammon, 1st Baron Ammon|Charles Ammon]] as part of a parliamentary commission to investigate the future of the dominion. Of the alternatives, he supported independence rather than a confederation.\n\n==Later parliamentary career, 1945\u201350==\nFollowing his re-election in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] on 5 July, Herbert noted of the new Parliament that \"the surge of Socialism into the House of Commons was something to see.\" The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], under [[Clement Attlee]], had won 393 seats, and the Conservatives had won only 197. Herbert said of the newly elected Labour MPs that \"Arrogance, I am sorry to say, remained. There was such a concerto of nastiness and hate and imbecile yelling, that I thanked God, many times, that I was an Independent and could be silent without disloyalty.\" Herbert campaigned to ensure that the newly elected MPs realised the significance of private members' time. He prepared a number of private member's bills, including on betting reform, legal aid for the poor, a fairer voting system, and the abolition of [[decree nisi]], among other things. However, he was unsuccessful in his first attempt to guarantee private members' time \u2013 later in the Parliament, it would be restored.<ref>Pound, pp. 197\u201398.</ref>\n\nIn autumn 1945, [[George Orwell]] had the essay ''[[Notes on Nationalism]]'' published in the magazine ''[[Polemic (magazine)|Polemic]]''. In it, he named Herbert as one of the followers of \"neo-Toryism\", who, according to Orwell, are marked by a \"desire not to recognise that British power and influence have declined\".<ref name=\"orwell\">{{cite web|url=http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat|title=Notes on Nationalism|website=Orwell.ru|last1=Orwell|first1=George|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> Herbert's biographer, Reginald Pound, notes that \"APH would have rejected the Tory affiliation, though his inclinations were with the Right.\"<ref>Pound, p. 208.</ref>\n\nFrom July 1945 through to 1946, Herbert worked on the [[libretto]] for [[Charles B. Cochran]]'s new musical, ''Big Ben''. It opened at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] on 17 July 1946 and was watched on its opening night by Churchill, [[Bernard Montgomery|Montgomery]], Attlee and Herbert, but Cochran was too ill to attend. During its first three months, it took an average of \u00a34,000 a week at the box office, but the running costs were also high so there was no fortune for Cochran or Herbert.<ref>Pound, pp. 199\u2013201.</ref> The show ended its run at the end of 1946, after 172 performances.<ref>Pound, p. 207.</ref> Cochran commissioned Herbert to write another musical, ''[[Bless the Bride]]'', which opened at the Adelphi on 26 April 1947. It ran for two and a quarter years, and was the source of \"an accretion of cash\" for Herbert as well as being Cochran's most successful musical.<ref>Pound, p. 211.</ref>\n\nHerbert sat on the Supreme Court Committee on Practice and Procedures, chaired by [[Raymond Evershed, 1st Baron Evershed|Raymond Evershed]], which was investigating the cost of litigation. He also chaired the Literary Sub-Committee of the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in London, which judged the literary compositions of 29 nations in their own languages. He also accepted an invitation to serve on the Council of the [[Festival of Britain]], to be held in 1951. At this time, he was already a member of the [[Thames Conservancy|Thames Conservancy Board]], a trustee of the [[National Maritime Museum]], president of the [[Inland Waterways Association]] and a vice president of the [[Living Streets (UK)|Pedestrians' Association for Road Safety]]. He also authored a critical study of [[Royal Commission|royal commissions]] for the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], which was dismissed for its \"light touch\". Herbert commented that \"Had it included graphs and tables and been written in a heavy style it would have been accepted as a major contribution to the practice of sound administration.\"<ref>Pound, p. 212\u201314</ref>\n\nHerbert was re-elected in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] and continued as an MP until the [[University constituency|University seats]] were abolished in 1950 as a result of the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]].<ref>Herbert, p. 31.</ref> Herbert's last speech, on 23 November 1949, was in favour of the [[Festival of Britain]], a cause he strongly supported.<ref name=\"seatrobe\" /> He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1945 in [[Winston Churchill]]'s [[1945 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37227 |supp=y |pages=4183\u20134184  |date=14 August 1945 }}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' noted \"his individual niche in the parliamentary temple as the doughty vindicator of the private member's rights, including not least the right to legislate.\"<ref>{{citation |title=none|newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=14 August 1945 |page=5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Herbert published a memoir of his service in the House of Commons, ''Independent Member'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Co., Inc., 1951).\n\nHerbert was the subject of a ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' TV programme in 1961 when he was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]].\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Hammersmith Terrace 07.JPG|thumb|12 Hammersmith Terrace]]\nIn the summer of 1914, Herbert first met his future wife, Gwendolyn Harriet Quilter, the daughter of [[Harry Quilter]].<ref>Pound, p. 37.</ref> They became engaged in December 1914 and were married in the first week of 1915 by [[Frederic Iremonger]], the vicar of St James the Great in [[Bethnal Green]]. Herbert wore his formal dress uniform of an Acting Leading Seaman during the wedding. They spent their honeymoon in a room in [[Fulham Road]].<ref>Pound, pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Gwendolyn lived to the age of 97, dying in 1986. Lady Herbert was elected as the first President of Hammersmith Chess Club <ref>[http://hammerchess.co.uk Chess Club site]</ref> in 1966 and was a well-known face on the chess circuit at that time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://hammerchess.co.uk/2016/03/18/a-brief-history-of-hammersmith-chess-club/ |title=A Brief History of Hammersmith Chess Club \u2013 Hammersmith Chess Club}}</ref> They had four children Crystal, Lavender, [[Jocelyn Herbert|Jocelyn]] and John.\n\nThe [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] Member of Parliament for [[Chesterfield]], [[Toby Perkins]], is his great-grandson.\n\n===The Thames===\nHerbert loved the [[River Thames]]. He lived beside it at [[Hammersmith]], West London. He was a Conservator (a member of the [[Thames Conservancy Board]]) and a Freeman of the [[Lightermen|Company of Watermen and Lightermen]]. In 1966 he wrote ''The Thames'' ([[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]) in which he explored the \"machinery\" of the river in all its aspects.\n\n==Death==\nIn the last days of 1970, Herbert was taken to [[Middlesex Hospital]] in [[Fitzrovia]], following a seizure that affected his left side and arm. Within six weeks, he was home again, and over many months his physical powers waned. In August 1971, he wrote his last letter to ''The Times'', an appeal for parliamentary good manners in refraining from \"witty derision of the literary exertions of Mr [[Harold Wilson]]\" and of the \"marine activities\" of [[Edward Heath]]. By then, he was describing himself as \"a recumbent nuisance.\" He died on 11 November 1971, and obituaries were published in both ''The Times'' and ''Punch''. ''The Times'' supplemented their obituary notice with a leading article. They described him as having done \"more than any man of his day to add to the gaiety of the nation.\"<ref name=death />\n\nA memorial service was held on 6 December in the church of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], which was \"crowded to overflowing\". On 7 December, the ''[[Congressional Record]]'' of the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] appeared with four pages of tributes to Herbert, by congressmen from Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Robert H. Land, chief of the Reference Department of the [[Library of Congress]], later said that \"[there is no] record or recollection of a similar tribute to another English writer in the proceedings of Congress.\"<ref name=death>Pound, pp. 299\u2013301.</ref>\n\n==References by other authors==\nIn his 1957 article \"Over Seventy\", lamenting the decline of the humorist, [[P. G. Wodehouse]] wrote: \"I want to see an A. P. Herbert on every street corner, an [[Alex Atkinson]] in every [[Public house|local]].\"\n\nThe title of [[Alexandra Fuller]]'s 2001 memoir ''[[Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood]]'' is taken from a Herbert quote, \"Don't let's go to the dogs tonight, for Mother will be there.\"<ref>[Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight] Cited from epigraph.</ref>\n\n==\"Misleading cases\"==\n[[File:UnCommonLaw1979Cover.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Uncommon Law]],'' collecting ''Misleading Cases in the Common Law'']]\n{{details|Uncommon Law}}\nStarting in 1910, he contributed regularly to ''[[Punch Magazine|Punch]]''. One series of his it took was ''[[Uncommon Law|Misleading Cases in the Common Law]]'' \u2013 the work for which he is best remembered. These were satirical pieces in the form of \"[[law reports]]\" or \"[[Legal judgment|judgement]]s\" on various aspects of the English legal and judicial system. Many featured the exploits of Albert Haddock, a tireless and veteran litigant. One of the best-known and most colourful is ''[[Board of Inland Revenue v Haddock]],'' also known as \"The Negotiable Cow\". Even the title is a humorous allusion to the entirely serious \"Smith's Leading Cases\". Herbert often referred to himself as \"A. P. Haddock\" in skits in ''Punch'' magazine, whether or not these had a courtroom setting.\n\nThanks to their realism, they were on several occasions mistakenly reported by newspapers both in Britain and elsewhere as factual. One of the \"cases\", supposedly establishing a novel crime of \"doing what you like\", was sharply criticised by an American [[law review]] article, whose author failed to note its entire absurdity.<ref>''Uncommon Law'', ''Rex v Haddock'': Is it a free country?, 5, pp. 24\u201329. Haddock is arrested for jumping into the [[River Thames]] from [[Hammersmith Bridge]]. When questioned to motive, Haddock replies, \"For fun\". The judge sums up: \"The appellant made the general answer that this was a free country and a man can do what he likes if he does nobody any harm.... It cannot be too clearly understood that this is ''not'' a free country, and it will be an evil day for the legal profession when it is... and least of all may they do unusual actions 'for fun'. People must not do things for fun. There is no reference to fun in any Act of Parliament.\"</ref> As such they are examples of the literary technique known as [[false document]]. And while in these fictitious law reports, the fictitious judges and lawyers regularly cited various real and venerable authorities, such as [[Henry de Bracton]], they were prone also to citing texts of Herbert's own imagination such as \"Wedderburn on Water Courses\" and \"A. Capone's Handbook for Bootleggers\".\n\nMore importantly, these cases were Herbert's vehicles for his law-reform work. Beneath their satire, they often carried cogent and sharp legal or political points that tied into his personal crusades against obsolescent legislation. Although fictional, they are, consequently, sometimes quoted in judicial decisions,<ref>See for example [http://www.securitymanagement.com/library/Messing_BankAmerica0703.pdf Messing v Bank of America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319153809/http://www.securitymanagement.com/library/Messing_BankAmerica0703.pdf |date=19 March 2006 }}(2002) at paragraph 1, and [http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/1999/214.html Victor Chandler International Ltd v The Commissioners of Custom and Excise and Teletext Limited] 1999 EWHC Ch 214, para 11, where [[Gavin Lightman (judge)|Mr Justice Lightman]] stated that a document, in the context of the [[Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981]], \"must be inanimate: neither a person nor A. P. Herbert's 'negotiable cow' can constitute a document.\"</ref> and are also the subject of academic research.<ref>{{citation|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010413060458/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/jmlc/sweeney31.htm#1|title=Rumpelheimer v.

The English use [[Right- and left-hand traffic|left-hand traffic]] but the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]] dictate right-hand traffic.</ref>\n\nOver his lifetime Herbert published five collections, entitled ''[[Misleading Cases in the Common Law]]'', ''[[More Misleading Cases]]'', ''[[Still More Misleading Cases]]'', ''[[Codd's Last Case]]'' and ''[[Bardot M.P.?]]''. Stray cases also appear in his collections of miscellaneous humorous essays, such as ''[[General Cargo]]''. Virtually all the cases were assembled into two omnibus volumes, ''[[Uncommon Law]]'' in 1935 and ''[[More Uncommon Law]]'' in 1982. A shorter selection, ''[[Wigs at Work]]'', appeared in 1966.\n\nThe [[BBC]] successfully adapted them for television as three series of ''[[A P Herbert's Misleading Cases]]'' (1967, 1968 and 1971), with [[Roy Dotrice]] as Haddock and [[Alastair Sim]] as the judge, Mr Justice Swallow.\n\n==Novels and other writings==\nHerbert wrote eight novels, including ''[[The Water Gipsies (novel)|The Water Gipsies]]'' (1930), and 15 plays, including the light operas ''[[Tantivy Towers]]'' (1931) and ''Big Ben'' (1946), and the comedy ''[[Bless the Bride]]'' (1947), which ran for two-and-a-quarter years in London.\n\nIn addition to his fiction, Herbert wrote ''[[What a Word!]]'' in 1935, continuing his campaign in ''Punch'' for better use of English, including a section on \"Plain English\", more than a decade ahead of Sir [[Ernest Gowers]]'s more celebrated work. Characteristically, Herbert uses humour to make his serious points about good writing. He was the author of the lyrics of the patriotic song \"[[Song of Liberty]]\", set in 1940 to the music of Edward [[Elgar]]'s ''[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches|Pomp and Circumstance March No. 4]]''. In 1944, a set of posters by [[Eric Kennington]], a personal friend, called ''Seeing It Through'', were accompanied by poems by Herbert. They describe the work of certain professionals in London in the war. After the war he wrote a booklet called \"The War Story of [[Southend Pier]]\" detailing an account of when the pier was taken over by the Royal Navy in World War II.\n\nIn 1967, Herbert published ''[[Sundials Old and New; or, Fun with the Sun]]''; a book describing in detail his long fascination with, and experiments in, sundial technology. In the book, he describes all manner of sundials, and recounts many of his experiments in designing and building a number of different models, including a few that could be used to tell your position on the earth as well as the local time.\n\nIn 1970 Herbert published ''[[A.P.H., His Life and Times]]'', dedicated to \"My dear wife, for our 56th anniversary\".\n\n==Selected filmography==\n*''[[Tell England (film)|Tell England]]'' (1931)\n*''[[Waltz Time (1933 film)|Waltz Time]]'' (1933)\n\n==Publications==\n===General===\n*''[[The Secret Battle]]'', 1919, Methuen (A novel about a soldier executed for cowardice.)\n*''[[The House by the River]]'', 1921, Methuen (A novel about a war poet who commits a murder.)

It covers 220&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and comprises three zones: a strictly protected core area, an administrative area and a buffer zone.\n\nIn 2004, the park was being considered for expansion in order to create a corridor from the border with [[Laos]] to the sea.\n\nThe park can be accessed by foot, moped or with a park guide's car.\n\n==History==\nIn 1932, the summit of B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 was selected by the French engineer Girard to become a hill station for the colonial administration of Hue. In the following years, a village including 139 villas and hotels was created. To accommodate holidaymakers and to avoid commuting on the steep, {{convert|19|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} road to the next major town, there was a post office, a market, and a hospital. By 1937 the number of holiday homes had reached 139 and it became known as the \"[[Da Lat|Dalat]] of central Vietnam\". Most of the visitors were high-ranking French [[VIP]]s. Not surprisingly the Viet Minh tried hard to spoil the holiday \u2013 the area saw some heavy fighting in the early 1950s. After independence from the French, B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 was soon forgotten and the villas abandoned; today they are in total ruin and only a few stone walls remain. At an elevation of 1250 meters above sea level, the national park is a popular summer retreat for the Vietnamese, who come to feel the relief of the cooler temperatures of B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3.\n\nThe area around Bach Ma was first protected as a series of forest reserves in 1937 and was declared a protected area by the government of [[South Vietnam]] in 1962. In 1986 the area was established as a [[national park]]. The forests of the park, like [[C\u00e1t Ti\u00ean National Park]], suffered from the use of defoliants like [[Agent Orange]] during the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n==Biodiversity of B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3==\nB\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 National Park is situated in the [[Annamite Mountains]] and is one of the wettest places in Vietnam.

It covers 220&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and comprises three zones: a strictly protected core area, an administrative area and a buffer zone.\n\nIn 2004, the park was being considered for expansion in order to create a corridor from the border with [[Laos]] to the sea.\n\nThe park can be accessed by foot, moped or with a park guide's car.\n\n==History==\nIn 1932, the summit of B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 was selected by the French engineer Girard to become a hill station for the colonial administration of Hue. In the following years, a village including 139 villas and hotels was created. To accommodate holidaymakers and to avoid commuting on the steep, {{convert|19|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} road to the next major town, there was a post office, a market, and a hospital. By 1937 the number of holiday homes had reached 139 and it became known as the \"[[Da Lat|Dalat]] of central Vietnam\". Most of the visitors were high-ranking French [[VIP]]s. Not surprisingly the Viet Minh tried hard to spoil the holiday \u2013 the area saw some heavy fighting in the early 1950s. After independence from the French, B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 was soon forgotten and the villas abandoned; today they are in total ruin and only a few stone walls remain. At an elevation of 1250 meters above sea level, the national park is a popular summer retreat for the Vietnamese, who come to feel the relief of the cooler temperatures of B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3.\n\nThe area around Bach Ma was first protected as a series of forest reserves in 1937 and was declared a protected area by the government of [[South Vietnam]] in 1962. In 1986 the area was established as a [[national park]]. The forests of the park, like [[C\u00e1t Ti\u00ean National Park]], suffered from the use of defoliants like [[Agent Orange]] during the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n==Biodiversity of B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3==\nB\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 National Park is situated in the [[Annamite Mountains]] and is one of the wettest places in Vietnam. Its mountains are composed mainly of [[granite]], and the topography of the park is generally very steep.\n\nB\u1ea1ch M\u00e3's position, at the [[biogeography|biogeographical]] border between northern and southern Vietnam, combined with its variety of habitats, ranging from the coast to high mountains, means the park is rich in [[biodiversity]].
