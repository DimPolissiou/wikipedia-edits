of the [[Mascarene Islands]] which include Mauritius and [[R\u00e9union]]. It is of volcanic origin and is surrounded by [[coral reef]], and just off its coast lie some tiny uninhabited islands. The island used to be the tenth [[District of Mauritius]]; it gained autonomous status on 10 December 2002, and it is governed by the Rodrigues Regional Assembly. The capital of the island is [[Port Mathurin]].\n\nIts inhabitants are Mauritian citizens. {{As of|2014}}, the island's population was about 41,669, according to [[Statistics Mauritius]].<ref name=\"stats2012\"/> Most of the inhabitants are of mixed African and European descent. Its economy is based mainly on fishing, farming, handicraft and a developing tourism sector.<ref name=\"info\"/>\n\nThe island (together with [[Agal\u00e9ga]] and [[Saint Brandon]]) forms part of the larger territory of the Republic of Mauritius with the [[President of Mauritius|President]] as head of state and the [[Chief Commissioner of Rodrigues|Chief Commissioner]] as head of government.\n\n==Etymology and history==\n{{See also|History of Mauritius}}\n[[File:DIOGO RODRIGUES Painting in GOA Records.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rodrigues was named after [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorer]] [[Diogo Rodrigues]], who first came upon the uninhabited island in 1528, under direction of Portuguese Viceroy [[Pedro Mascarenhas]] (namesake of the [[Mascarene Islands]]).]]\nThe uninhabited island was named after the Portuguese explorer [[Diogo Rodrigues]] in February 1528. Many maps also describe it as Diego Roiz.  From the 10th century, [[Arabs]] have been known to visit the [[Mascarene Islands]]. A 12th-century map by the Arab geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Ash-Sharif al-Idrisi]]{{Verify source|date=November 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} supposedly contains them, and the [[Cantino planisphere]] of {{circa|1500}} and some other contemporary maps clearly show the three islands of the Mascarenes as ''Dina Arobi'' (or ''Harobi''), ''Dina Margabin'' and ''Dina Moraze''. These are apparently corrupted [[transliteration]]s or transcriptions of the [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|\u062f\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0647\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0628}} ''Diva Harab'' (\"Desert Island\"), {{lang|ar|\u062f\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0646}} ''Diva Maghrebin'' (\"Western Island\") and {{lang|ar|\u062f\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0642}} ''Diva Mashriq'' (\"Eastern Island\"). While the second clearly refers to [[R\u00e9union]], sources disagree about which of the other is [[Mauritius]] and which one Rodrigues, which are both to the east of R\u00e9union and arranged in a somewhat stylised way on these maps. However, even in its original state, Rodrigues had some [[karst]], while Mauritius even after suffering 500 years of [[deforestation]] can by no means be called \"desert\" even in a colloquial sense.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Arabs|url=http://www.mauritiusencyclopedia.com/History/Arabs.htm|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Mauritiana|accessdate=6 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501213112/http://www.mauritiusencyclopedia.com/History/Arabs.htm|archivedate=1 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe island was located again in February 1507. Part of the fleet of [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] and [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]], [[Diogo Fernandes Pereira]]'s ''Cirne''{{Verify source|date=November 2009}}<!-- correct transciption? \"Cern\u00e9\"? --> spotted R\u00e9union on 9 February after a [[cyclone]] diverted their<!-- deliberately ambiguous&nbsp;\u2014 not clear whether only \"Cirne\" was diverted --> course. The other two islands were subsequently rediscovered. The initial name was ''Diogo Fernandes''; ''Domingo Froiz'' was given as a name some years later, and by 1528 it had been again renamed after the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[navigator]] [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Diogo Rodrigues]] and has remained so since. The [[orthography]] has been less stable at first, with the name being [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] ''Diogo Rodr\u00edguez'' (Spanish maps), ''Diego Roiz'', ''Diego Ruys'' (Dutch maps) (or even ''Diego Ruy's Island''), ''Dygarroys'' or ''Bygarroys''. Some early French sources called it ''\u00cele Marianne''.\n\nDue to the island lying far off the beaten track of seafarers at that time, it received few visits. From 1601, the Dutch began visiting the island somewhat more regularly for fresh supplies of food. In 1691, the [[Huguenot]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]] and seven companions landed on the island, intending to set up a farming colony of [[Protestant]] refugees. Farming was not successful, but there was an abundance of tortoises, turtles, birds, fish and other seafood.\n\nDuring the 18th century several attempts were made by the French to develop the island. African [[slavery|slaves]] (ancestors of the present population) were brought to Rodrigues to develop stock-breeding and farming. In 1735 a permanent French settlement was established, subordinated to [[R\u00e9union|\u00cele Bourbon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mauritius.htm#Rodrigues|title=Mauritius|website=www.worldstatesmen.org|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1809, after a brief battle with the French, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] troops took possession of Rodrigues.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Joslin, Litherland and Simpkin.|title=British Battles and Medals.|page=30. Published Spink, London. 1988}}{{ISBN| 0907605257}}</ref>\n\nAfter British occupation, slavery was eventually [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolished]] in 1834.  By 1843, population had declined to a low of 250.\n\nIn 1883, the eruption of the [[Indonesia]]n volcano [[Krakatoa]] was heard at Rodrigues Island and it remains the furthest point at almost {{convert|4800|km|abbr=on}}, at which the explosion was heard.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-krakatoa-made-the-biggest-bang-476616.html |title=How Krakatoa made the biggest bang&nbsp;\u2014 Science&nbsp;\u2014 News |newspaper=The Independent |date=3 May 2006 |accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref> The sound was described as \"the roar of heavy guns\".  Naval ships were ordered to investigate as it was feared the sound was due to a ship in distress firing its guns.  Having been heard from about {{convert|5000|km|abbr=on}} away on the other side of the Indian Ocean, the noise remains the loudest sound in recorded history.\n\nIn 1968, Rodrigues was joined with [[Mauritius]] when it attained independence; in 2002 when it became an autonomous region of Mauritius, the island was made the seat of the Roman Catholic [[Vicariate Apostolic of Rodrigues]].\n\nIn 1997, the {{convert|40|ft|m|sp=us|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} Russian yacht ''Admiral Nevelskoi'' was found in the lagoon of [[Rodrigues Island]]. Formerly captained solo by professor Leonid Lysenko for the Russian [[Maritime State University]] as a research ship, the vessel's mast and rudder broke on a voyage in 1995, drifting for 21 days until Lysenko was rescued by the crew of the Ukrainian vessel ''Arkaja'', at which time the ''Admiral Nevelskoi'' was abandoned. Lysenko was certain that the ship would eventually sink; however, the vessel continued to drift at sea without crew for over 2 years before finally washing up on Rodrigues, at which time it was removed from the water and brought ashore. In 2010, Russian Hon. Eric Typhis Degtyarenko located the yacht and contacted the Maritime State University, at which time the ship was converted to a [[maritime museum]] in recognition as Russia's only link to the Indian Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=2150554|title=Admiral Nevelskoi - ShipSpotting.com - Ship Photos and Ship Tracker|website=www.shipspotting.com|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Rodrigues CalcareniticShore.jpg|thumb|Calcarenitic shore of Rodrigues island, at Pointe Coton]]\nRodrigues is a [[volcanic island]] rising from a ridge along the edge of the [[Mascarene Plateau]].

Rodrigues enjoys a mild tropical maritime climate with persistent trade winds blowing throughout the year. Mean summer temperature is {{convert|25.9|C|F}} and mean winter temperature is around {{convert|22.3|C|F}}. The temperature difference between summer and winter is 3.6&nbsp;\u00b0C. January to March are the hottest months and August is the coolest month. The wettest month is February; September and October are the driest months. The climate is hotter and drier than in Mauritius. Cyclones may arise from November to April, and Rodrigues is more often hit than Mauritius.<ref name=MMS>{{cite web|url=http://metservice.intnet.mu/climate-services/climate-of-rodrigues-and-islands.php|publisher=Mauritius Meteorological Services|title=Climate of Rodrigues & other outer islands|accessdate=26 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|collapsed = yes\n|location = Rodrigues\n|Jan record high C = 33.9\n|Feb record high C = 34.0\n|Mar record high C = 33.9\n|Apr record high C = 33.0\n|May record high C = 30.9\n|Jun record high C = 30.9\n|Jul record high C = 30.4\n|Aug record high C = 31.2\n|Sep record high C = 30.7\n|Oct record high C = 30.9\n|Nov record high C = 30.9\n|Dec record high C = 33.1\n|year record high C = 34.0\n|Jan high C = 29.2\n|Feb high C = 29.3\n|Mar high C = 29.4\n|Apr high C = 28.7\n|May high C = 27.5\n|Jun high C = 26.0\n|Jul high C = 25.0\n|Aug high C = 24.8\n|Sep high C = 25.4\n|Oct high C = 26.3\n|Nov high C = 27.4\n|Dec high C = 28.7\n|year high C = 27.3\n|Jan low C = 23.6\n|Feb low C = 23.8\n|Mar low C = 23.7\n|Apr low C = 23.0\n|May low C = 21.6\n|Jun low C = 20.1\n|Jul low C = 19.1\n|Aug low C = 18.8\n|Sep low C = 19.3\n|Oct low C = 20.1\n|Nov low C = 21.3\n|Dec low C = 22.8\n|year low C = 21.4\n|Jan record low C = 18.4\n|Feb record low C = 19.8\n|Mar record low C = 19.0\n|Apr record low C = 18.4\n|May record low C = 18.1\n|Jun record low C = 16.5\n|Jul record low C = 14.5\n|Aug record low C = 15.2\n|Sep record low C = 15.8\n|Oct record low C = 16.5\n|Nov record low C = 17.2\n|Dec record low C = 19.2\n|year record low C = 14.5\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 150.0\n|Feb precipitation mm = 184.7\t\n|Mar precipitation mm = 131.2\t\n|Apr precipitation mm = 117.0\n|May precipitation mm = 78.3\n|Jun precipitation mm = 77.6\n|Jul precipitation mm = 80.8\n|Aug precipitation mm = 59.4\n|Sep precipitation mm = 43.8\n|Oct precipitation mm = 40.7\n|Nov precipitation mm = 70.0\n|Dec precipitation mm = 71.0\n|year precipitation mm = 1104.5\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 12\n|Feb precipitation days = 13\n|Mar precipitation days = 13\n|Apr precipitation days = 13\n|May precipitation days = 12\n|Jun precipitation days = 13\n|Jul precipitation days = 15\n|Aug precipitation days = 13\n|Sep precipitation days = 9\n|Oct precipitation days = 8\n|Nov precipitation days = 7\n|Dec precipitation days = 8\n|year precipitation days = \n|Jan humidity = 79\n|Feb humidity = 81\n|Mar humidity = 80\n|Apr humidity = 79\n|May humidity = 75\n|Jun humidity = 74\n|Jul humidity = 75\n|Aug humidity = 74\n|Sep humidity = 74\n|Oct humidity = 74\n|Nov humidity = 76\n|Dec humidity = 77\n|year humidity = 76\n|Jan sun = 275.9\n|Feb sun = 240.1\n|Mar sun = 257.3\n|Apr sun = 243.0\n|May sun = 244.9\n|Jun sun = 219.0\n|Jul sun = 232.5\n|Aug sun = 244.9\n|Sep sun = 237.0\n|Oct sun = 275.9\n|Nov sun = 273.0\n|Dec sun = 285.2\n|year sun = 3028.7\n|Jand sun = 8.9\n|Febd sun = 8.5\n|Mard sun = 8.3\n|Aprd sun = 8.1\n|Mayd sun = 7.9\n|Jund sun = 7.3\n|Juld sun = 7.5\n|Augd sun = 7.9\n|Sepd sun = 7.9\n|Octd sun = 8.9\n|Novd sun = 9.1\n|Decd sun = 9.2\n|yeard sun = 8.9\n|source 1 = Mauritius Meteorological Services<ref name=MMS />\n|date=January 2015\n}}\n\n===Biodiversity===\n[[File:1 Friendly giant tortoise at Francois Leguat park.jpg|thumb|right|An introduced [[Aldabra giant tortoise]] (''[[Aldabrachelys gigantea]]'') at [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat Giant Tortoise and Cave Reserve|Francois Leguat Reserve]]]]\nRodrigues was characterised by endemic plant and animal species in abundance, but since the seventeenth century much of its biodiversity has been eradicated.

However, on 20 November 2001, the [[National Assembly of Mauritius|Mauritius National Assembly]] unanimously adopted two laws giving Rodrigues its autonomy, creating a decentralised government system. This new legislation has allowed the implementation of a regional assembly in Rodrigues constituting 18 members and an executive council headed by a Chief Commissioner. The council meets every week to make decisions, draw up laws and manage the budget. The [[Chief Commissioner]] has the main task of informing the Mauritian Prime Minister of the management of the island's concerns. The [[2017 Rodriguan local election|last election of the Rodriguan Regional Assembly]] was held on 12 February 2017. The [[Organisation du Peuple de Rodrigues]] (OPR) party was the winner and obtained ten seats, while the [[Mouvement Rodriguais]] (MR) obtained seven. The current chief commissioner is [[Louis Serge Clair]] and the [[Chief Executive of Rodrigues]] is [[Davis Hee Hong Wye]].\n\n===Electoral regions===\nThe island includes six electoral regions: La Ferme (Region 1), Marechal (Region 2), Saint Gabriel (Region 3), Baie aux Huitres (Region 4), Port Mathurin (Region 5) and Grande Montagne (Region 6). Rodrigues Regional Assembly election are held every five years.\n\n===Zones===\nRodrigues is divided into 14 municipalities or zones.

The government provides free education to students up to the tertiary level.\nEducation is taught mainly in [[English language|English]].\n\n==Transportation==\nRodrigues is served by the [[Sir Ga\u00ebtan Duval Airport]] in Point Corail.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Rodrigues Cattle August 2015.jpg|alt=Cattle grazing in a hillside field overlooking Rivi\u00e8re Cocos.|thumb|Small-scale cattle rearing contributes to the economy of Rodrigues.]]\nThe economy of Rodrigues is mostly dependent on Mauritius. The main sources of income and economic activity are tourism, fishing, agriculture (especially of onions, garlic and chilli), and animal rearing. The [[handicraft]] industry has proven to be beneficial to the economy of the island. However, the income derived from the export of sea products, cattle, and food crops is smaller than the costs of imported products, creating a deficit.\nIt has a special relationship with English-speaking countries, such as England in the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/mauritius/economy|title=Mauritius : Economy - The Commonwealth|website=thecommonwealth.org|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Music and folklore===\nThe traditional music of the island is known as Sega Tambour. The music has an accentuated beat, usually accompanied by an [[accordion]], [[clapping]] and the use of improvised percussion instruments like [[bamboo]]. The [[Dance music#Folk dance music|folk dance music]] is similar to [[polka]]s, [[quadrille]]s, [[waltz]]es and [[Scottish music|Scottish]] [[Reel (dance)|reel]]s.\n\n===Cuisine===\nRodrigues cuisine consists of dishes from local products: fruit, vegetables, seafood (fish, octopus, crab, shrimp, lobster) and meat. National dishes include sausages with kreolin\u0117s, rougaille sauce, octopus with curry, Azim salad and Rodrigues cake.\n\n===Sports===\nThe most common sport in Rodrigues is [[association football]]. There are local competitions almost throughout the year and in specific competitions, the winning team travels to Mauritius for sport exchange. [[Volleyball]] is also popular. There is also a public [[swimming pool]] at Marechal, a village located in the center of the island, and a [[stadium]] at Camp Du Rois in the region of [[Port Mathurin]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--\n ================================== ({{NoMoreLinks}}) ==================================\n DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

of the [[Mascarene Islands]] which include Mauritius and [[R\u00e9union]]. It is of volcanic origin and is surrounded by [[coral reef]], and just off its coast lie some tiny uninhabited islands. The island used to be the tenth [[District of Mauritius]]; it gained autonomous status on 10 December 2002, and it is governed by the Rodrigues Regional Assembly. The capital of the island is [[Port Mathurin]].\n\nIts inhabitants are Mauritian citizens. {{As of|2014}}, the island's population was about 41,669, according to [[Statistics Mauritius]].<ref name=\"stats2012\"/> Most of the inhabitants are of mixed African and European descent. Its economy is based mainly on fishing, farming, handicraft and a developing tourism sector.<ref name=\"info\"/>\n\nThe island (together with [[Agal\u00e9ga]] and [[Saint Brandon]]) forms part of the larger territory of the Republic of Mauritius with the [[President of Mauritius|President]] as head of state and the [[Chief Commissioner of Rodrigues|Chief Commissioner]] as head of government.\n\n==Etymology and history==\n{{See also|History of Mauritius}}\n[[File:DIOGO RODRIGUES Painting in GOA Records.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rodrigues was named after [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorer]] [[Diogo Rodrigues]], who first came upon the uninhabited island in 1528, under direction of Portuguese Viceroy [[Pedro Mascarenhas]] (namesake of the [[Mascarene Islands]]).]]\nThe uninhabited island was named after the Portuguese explorer [[Diogo Rodrigues]] in February 1528. Many maps also describe it as Diego Roiz.  From the 10th century, [[Arabs]] have been known to visit the [[Mascarene Islands]]. A 12th-century map by the Arab geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Ash-Sharif al-Idrisi]]{{Verify source|date=November 2009}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} supposedly contains them, and the [[Cantino planisphere]] of {{circa|1500}} and some other contemporary maps clearly show the three islands of the Mascarenes as ''Dina Arobi'' (or ''Harobi''), ''Dina Margabin'' and ''Dina Moraze''. These are apparently corrupted [[transliteration]]s or transcriptions of the [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] {{lang|ar|\u062f\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0647\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0628}} ''Diva Harab'' (\"Desert Island\"), {{lang|ar|\u062f\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0646}} ''Diva Maghrebin'' (\"Western Island\") and lang|ar|\u062f\u064a\u0641\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0642}} ''Diva Mashriq'' (\"Eastern Island\"). While the second clearly refers to [[R\u00e9union]], sources disagree about which of the other is [[Mauritius]] and which one Rodrigues, which are both to the east of R\u00e9union and arranged in a somewhat stylised way on these maps. However, even in its original state, Rodrigues had some [[karst]], while Mauritius even after suffering 500 years of [[deforestation]] can by no means be called \"desert\" even in a colloquial sense.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Arabs|url=http://www.mauritiusencyclopedia.com/History/Arabs.htm|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Mauritiana|accessdate=6 March 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501213112/http://www.mauritiusencyclopedia.com/History/Arabs.htm|archivedate=1 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe island was located again in February 1507. Part of the fleet of [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] and [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]], [[Diogo Fernandes Pereira]]'s ''Cirne''{{Verify source|date=November 2009}}<!-- correct transciption? \"Cern\u00e9\"? --> spotted R\u00e9union on 9 February after a [[cyclone]] diverted their<!-- deliberately ambiguous&nbsp;\u2014 not clear whether only \"Cirne\" was diverted --> course. The other two islands were subsequently rediscovered. The initial name was ''Diogo Fernandes''; ''Domingo Froiz'' was given as a name some years later, and by 1528 it had been again renamed after the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[navigator]] [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Diogo Rodrigues]] and has remained so since. The [[orthography]] has been less stable at first, with the name being [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] ''Diogo Rodr\u00edguez'' (Spanish maps), ''Diego Roiz'', ''Diego Ruys'' (Dutch maps) (or even ''Diego Ruy's Island''), ''Dygarroys'' or ''Bygarroys''. Some early French sources called it ''\u00cele Marianne''.\n\nDue to the island lying far off the beaten track of seafarers at that time, it received few visits. From 1601, the Dutch began visiting the island somewhat more regularly for fresh supplies of food. In 1691, the [[Huguenot]] [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]] and seven companions landed on the island, intending to set up a farming colony of [[Protestant]] refugees. Farming was not successful, but there was an abundance of tortoises, turtles, birds, fish and other seafood.\n\nDuring the 18th century several attempts were made by the French to develop the island. African [[slavery|slaves]] (ancestors of the present population) were brought to Rodrigues to develop stock-breeding and farming. In 1735 a permanent French settlement was established, subordinated to [[R\u00e9union|\u00cele Bourbon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mauritius.htm#Rodrigues|title=Mauritius|website=www.worldstatesmen.org|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1809, after a brief battle with the French, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] troops took possession of Rodrigues.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Joslin, Litherland and Simpkin.|title=British Battles and Medals.|page=30.

Having been heard from about {{convert|5000|km|abbr=on}} away on the other side of the Indian Ocean, the noise remains the loudest sound in recorded history.\n\nIn 1968, Rodrigues was joined with [[Mauritius]] when it attained independence; in 2002 when it became an autonomous region of Mauritius, the island was made the seat of the Roman Catholic [[Vicariate Apostolic of Rodrigues]].\n\nIn 1997, the {{convert|40|ft|m|sp=us|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} Russian yacht ''Admiral Nevelskoi'' was found in the lagoon of [[Rodrigues Island]]. Formerly captained solo by professor Leonid Lysenko for the Russian [[Maritime State University]] as a research ship, the vessel's mast and rudder broke on a voyage in 1995, drifting for 21 days until Lysenko was rescued by the crew of the Ukrainian vessel ''Arkaja'', at which time the ''Admiral Nevelskoi'' was abandoned. Lysenko was certain that the ship would eventually sink; however, the vessel continued to drift at sea without crew for over 2 years before finally washing up on Rodrigues, at which time it was removed from the water and brought ashore. In 2010, Russian Hon. Eric Typhis Degtyarenko located the yacht and contacted the Maritime State University, at which time the ship was converted to a [[maritime museum]] in recognition as Russia's only link to the Indian Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=2150554|title=Admiral Nevelskoi - ShipSpotting.com - Ship Photos and Ship Tracker|website=www.shipspotting.com|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Rodrigues CalcareniticShore.jpg|thumb|Calcarenitic shore of Rodrigues island, at Pointe Coton]]\nRodrigues is a [[volcanic island]] rising from a ridge along the edge of the [[Mascarene Plateau]].

People born in Rodrigues island are called Rodriguans.\n\n==Education==\nThe education system in Rodrigues is similar to that throughout the rest of [[Education in Mauritius|Mauritius]]. The government provides free education to students up to the tertiary level.\nEducation is taught mainly in [[English language|English]].\n\n==Transportation==\nRodrigues is served by the [[Sir Ga\u00ebtan Duval Airport]] in Point Corail.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Rodrigues Cattle August 2015.jpg|alt=Cattle grazing in a hillside field overlooking Rivi\u00e8re Cocos.|thumb|Small-scale cattle rearing contributes to the economy of Rodrigues.]]\nThe economy of Rodrigues is mostly dependent on Mauritius. The main sources of income and economic activity are tourism, fishing, agriculture (especially of onions, garlic and chilli), and animal rearing. The [[handicraft]] industry has proven to be beneficial to the economy of the island. However, the income derived from the export of sea products, cattle, and food crops is smaller than the costs of imported products, creating a deficit.\nIt has a special relationship with English-speaking countries, such as England in the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/mauritius/economy|title=Mauritius : Economy - The Commonwealth|website=thecommonwealth.org|accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Music and folklore===\nThe traditional music of the island is known as Sega Tambour. The music has an accentuated beat, usually accompanied by an [[accordion]], [[clapping]] and the use of improvised percussion instruments like [[bamboo]]. The [[Dance music#Folk dance music|folk dance music]] is similar to [[polka]]s, [[quadrille]]s, [[waltz]]es and [[Scottish music|Scottish]] [[Reel (dance)|reel]]s.\n\n===Cuisine===\nRodrigues cuisine consists of dishes from local products: fruit, vegetables, seafood (fish, octopus, crab, shrimp, lobster) and meat. National dishes include sausages with kreolin\u0117s, rougaille sauce, octopus with curry, Azim salad and Rodrigues cake.\n\n===Sports===\nThe most common sport in Rodrigues is [[association football]]. There are local competitions almost throughout the year and in specific competitions, the winning team travels to Mauritius for sport exchange. [[Volleyball]] is also popular. There is also a public [[swimming pool]] at Marechal, a village located in the center of the island, and a [[stadium]] at Camp Du Rois in the region of [[Port Mathurin]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--\n ================================== ({{NoMoreLinks}}) ==================================\n DO NOT ADD MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.
