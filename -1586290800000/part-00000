An [[epeiric sea|epeiric]] (or \"shelf\") sea on the [[Europe]]an [[continental shelf]], it connects to the ocean through the [[English Channel]] in the south and the [[Norwegian Sea]] in the north. It is more than {{convert|970|km|mi}} long and {{convert|580|km|mi}} wide, with an area of {{convert|570000|km2|sqmi}}.\n\nThe North Sea has long been the site of important European shipping lanes as well as a major [[fishery]]. The coast is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in bordering countries, and more recently the sea has developed into a rich source of energy resources, including [[fossil fuel]]s, [[wind energy|wind]], and early efforts in [[wave power]].\n\nHistorically, the North Sea has featured prominently in geopolitical and military affairs, particularly in Northern Europe. It was also important globally through the power northern Europeans projected worldwide during much of the Middle Ages and into the modern era. The North Sea was the centre of the [[Viking Age|Vikings' rise]]. Subsequently, the [[Hanseatic League]], the [[Dutch Golden Age|Netherlands]], and the [[British Empire|British]] each sought to dominate the North Sea and thus access to the world's markets and resources. As Germany's only outlet to the ocean, the North Sea continued to be strategically important through both World Wars.\n\nThe coast of the North Sea presents a diversity of geological and geographical features. In the north, deep [[fjord]]s and sheer cliffs mark the [[Norway|Norwegian]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] coastlines, whereas in the south, the coast consists primarily of sandy beaches and wide [[mudflat]]s. Due to the dense population, heavy industrialization, and intense use of the sea and area surrounding it, there have been various environmental issues affecting the sea's ecosystems.

An [[epeiric sea|epeiric]] (or \"shelf\") sea on the [[Europe]]an [[continental shelf]], it connects to the ocean through the [[English Channel]] in the south and the [[Norwegian Sea]] in the north. It is more than {{convert|970|km|mi}} long and {{convert|580|km|mi}} wide, with an area of {{convert|570000|km2|sqmi}}.\n\nThe North Sea has long been the site of important European shipping lanes as well as a major [[fishery]]. The coast is a popular destination for recreation and tourism in bordering countries, and more recently the sea has developed into a rich source of energy resources, including [[fossil fuel]]s, [[wind energy|wind]], and early efforts in [[wave power]].\n\nHistorically, the North Sea has featured prominently in geopolitical and military affairs, particularly in Northern Europe. It was also important globally through the power northern Europeans projected worldwide during much of the Middle Ages and into the modern era. The North Sea was the centre of the [[Viking Age|Vikings' rise]]. Subsequently, the [[Hanseatic League]], the [[Dutch Golden Age|Netherlands]], and the [[British Empire|British]] each sought to dominate the North Sea and thus access to the world's markets and resources. As Germany's only outlet to the ocean, the North Sea continued to be strategically important through both World Wars.\n\nThe coast of the North Sea presents a diversity of geological and geographical features. In the north, deep [[fjord]]s and sheer cliffs mark the [[Norway|Norwegian]] and [[Scotland|Scottish]] coastlines, whereas in the south, the coast consists primarily of sandy beaches and wide [[mudflat]]s. Due to the dense population, heavy industrialization, and intense use of the sea and area surrounding it, there have been various environmental issues affecting the sea's ecosystems. Adverse environmental issues \u2013 commonly including [[overfishing]], industrial and agricultural [[surface runoff|runoff]], [[dredging]], and dumping, among others \u2013 have led to a number of efforts to prevent degradation of the sea while still making use of its economic potential.\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Geography of the North Sea}}\n{{See also|List of rivers discharging into the North Sea}}\n{{Annotated image | float=right| caption=Sk{{=}}[[Skagerrak]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ka=[[Kattegat]]<br />Eng Ch=[[English Channel]] | image=Nseamap.gif | width=240 | height=313\n|image-width=250\n|annotations=\n{{Annotation|106|142|'''North<br />Sea'''}}\n{{Annotation|81|10|'''[[Norwegian Sea|Norwegian<br />Sea]]'''}}\n{{Annotation|163|152|'''[[Skagerrak|Sk]]'''}}\n{{Annotation|188|166|'''[[Kattegat|Ka]]'''}}\n{{Annotation|24|280|'''[[English Channel|Eng Ch]]'''}}\n}}\nThe North Sea is bounded by the [[Orkney Islands]] and east coast of [[Great Britain]] to the west<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia\n|last = L.M.A.\n|editor = University of Chicago\n|encyclopedia =Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Macrop\u00e6dia\n|title = Europe\n|edition = Fifteenth\n|year = 1985\n|publisher = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.\n|volume =18\n|location = U.S.A.\n|isbn =978-0-85229-423-9\n|pages = 832\u2013835\n}}\n</ref> and the northern and [[central Europe]]an mainland to the east and south, including [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and [[France]].<ref name=\"American\">{{cite book\n|last=Ripley\n|first=George |author2=Charles Anderson Dana\n|title=The American Cyclopaedia: A Popular Dictionary of General Knowledge\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GEpMAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA499\n|year=1883\n|publisher= D.

[[Application software|Applications]] or components, coming in the form of [[#Bundles|bundle]]s for [[software deployment|deployment]], can be remotely installed, started, stopped, updated, and uninstalled without requiring a [[Reboot (computer)|reboot]]; management of [[Java package]]s/[[class (computer science)|class]]es is specified in great detail. Application life cycle management is implemented via APIs that allow for remote [[downloading]] of management policies. The service registry allows bundles to detect the addition of new services, or the removal of services, and adapt accordingly.\n\nThe OSGi specifications have evolved beyond the original focus of service gateways, and are now used in applications ranging from [[mobile phone]]s to the open-source [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse IDE]]. Other application areas include [[automobile]]s, [[industrial automation]], [[building automation]], [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]s, [[grid computing]], [[entertainment]], [[fleet management]] and [[application server]]s.\n\n== Specification process ==\nThe OSGi specification is developed by the members in an open process and made available to the public free of charge under the OSGi Specification License.<ref>[http://www.osgi.org/Main/OSGiSpecificationLicense OSGi Specification License]</ref> The OSGi Alliance has a [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] program that is open to members only. As of November 2010, there are seven certified OSGi framework [[implementation]]s.<ref>https://www.osgi.org/osgi-compliance/osgi-certification/osgi-certified-products/</ref> A separate page lists both certified and non-certified [[OSGi Specification Implementations]], which include OSGi frameworks and other OSGi specifications.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Osgi framework.svg|thumb|250px|OSGi Service Gateway Architecture]]\nOSGi is a Java framework for developing and deploying modular software programs and libraries. Each bundle is a tightly coupled, dynamically loadable collection of classes, jars, and configuration files that explicitly declare their external dependencies (if any).\n\nThe framework is conceptually divided into the following areas:\n;Bundles:Bundles are normal [[JAR (file format)|JAR]] components with extra manifest headers.\n;Services:The services layer connects bundles in a dynamic way by offering a publish-find-bind model for plain old Java interfaces ([[POJI]]s) or [[plain old Java object]]s (POJOs).\n;Services Registry:The [[application programming interface]] for management services.\n;Life-Cycle:The [[application programming interface]] for life cycle management (install, start, stop, update, and uninstall) for bundles.\n;Modules:The layer that defines encapsulation and declaration of dependencies (how a bundle can import and export code).\n;Security:The layer that handles the security aspects by limiting bundle functionality to pre-defined capabilities.\n;Execution Environment:Defines what methods and classes are available in a specific platform. There is no fixed list of execution environments, since it is subject to change as the [[Java Community Process]] creates new versions and editions of Java. However, the following set is currently supported by most OSGi implementations:\n:*[[Connected Device Configuration|CDC-1.0/Foundation-1.0]]\n:*[[Connected Device Configuration|CDC-1.1/Foundation-1.1]]\n:*OSGi/Minimum-1.0\n:*OSGi/Minimum-1.1\n:*JRE-1.1\n:*From J2SE-1.2 up to J2SE-1.6\n\n==Bundles==\n[[Image:osgi-system-layering.svg|thumb|Right|250px|Classification: OSGi]]\n\nA bundle is a group of Java classes and additional resources equipped with a detailed manifest <code>[[MANIFEST.MF]]</code> file on all its contents, as well as additional services needed to give the included group of Java classes more sophisticated behaviors, to the extent of deeming the entire aggregate a component.\n\nBelow is an example of a typical <code>[[MANIFEST.MF]]</code> file with OSGi Headers:\n<source lang=\"properties\" line>\n Bundle-Name: Hello World\n Bundle-SymbolicName: org.wikipedia.helloworld\n Bundle-Description: A Hello World bundle\n Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2\n Bundle-Version: 1.0.0\n Bundle-Activator: org.wikipedia.Activator\n Export-Package: org.wikipedia.helloworld;version=\"1.0.0\"\n Import-Package: org.osgi.framework;version=\"1.3.0\"\n</source>\nThe meaning of the contents in the example is as follows:<ref>[http://blog.springsource.com/2008/02/18/creating-osgi-bundles/ Creating OSGi bundles] by Costin Leau</ref>\n\n# '''Bundle-Name:''' Defines a human-readable name for this bundle, Simply assigns a short name to the bundle.\n# '''Bundle-SymbolicName:''' The only required header, this entry specifies a unique identifier for a bundle, based on the [[Reverse domain name notation|reverse domain name convention]] (used also by the [[java packages]]).\n# '''Bundle-Description:''' A description of the bundle's functionality.\n# '''Bundle-ManifestVersion:''' Indicates the OSGi specification to use for reading this bundle.\n# '''Bundle-Version:''' Designates a version number to the bundle.\n# '''Bundle-Activator:''' Indicates the class name to be invoked once a bundle is activated.\n# '''Export-Package:''' Expresses which Java packages contained in a bundle will be made available to the outside world.\n# '''Import-Package:''' Indicates which Java packages will be required from the outside world to fulfill the dependencies needed in a bundle.\n\n== Life-cycle ==\n[[Image:OSGi Bundle Life-Cycle.svg|thumb|Right|250px|OSGi Bundle Life-Cycle]]\nA Life Cycle layer adds bundles that can be dynamically installed, started, stopped, updated and uninstalled. Bundles rely on the module layer for class loading but add an API to manage the modules in run time. The life cycle layer introduces dynamics that are normally not part of an application. Extensive dependency mechanisms are used to assure the correct operation of the environment. Life cycle operations are fully protected with the security architecture.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Bundle State\n! Description\n|-\n| '''INSTALLED'''\n| The bundle has been successfully installed.\n|-\n| '''RESOLVED'''\n| All Java classes that the bundle needs are available. This state indicates that the bundle is either ready to be started or has stopped.\n|-\n| '''STARTING'''\n| The bundle is being started, the <code>[http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v41/org/osgi/framework/BundleActivator.html#start(org.osgi.framework.BundleContext) BundleActivator.start]</code> method has been called but the start method has not yet returned. When the bundle has an activation policy, the bundle will remain in the STARTING state until the bundle is activated according to its activation policy.\n|-\n| '''ACTIVE'''\n| The bundle has been successfully activated and is running; its Bundle Activator start method has been called and returned.\n|-\n| '''STOPPING'''\n| The bundle is being stopped. The <code>[http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v41/org/osgi/framework/BundleActivator.html#stop(org.osgi.framework.BundleContext) BundleActivator.stop]</code> method has been called but the stop method has not yet returned.\n|-\n| '''UNINSTALLED'''\n| The bundle has been uninstalled. It cannot move into another state.\n|}\nBelow is an example of a typical Java class implementing the <code>[http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/framework/BundleActivator.html BundleActivator]</code> interface:\n<source lang=\"java\">\npackage org.wikipedia;\n\nimport org.osgi.framework.BundleActivator;\nimport org.osgi.framework.BundleContext;\n\npublic class Activator implements BundleActivator {\n\tprivate BundleContext context;\n\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception {\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Starting: Hello World\");\n\t\tthis.context = context;\n\t}\n\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void stop(BundleContext context) throws Exception {\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Stopping: Goodbye Cruel World\");\n\t\tthis.context = null;\n\t}\n}\n</source>\n\n==Services==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Standard services===\nThe OSGi Alliance has specified many services. Services are specified by a [[Java interface]]. Bundles can implement this interface and register the service with the Service Registry. Clients of the service can find it in the registry, or react to it when it appears or disappears.\n\nThe table below shows a description of OSGi System Services:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width = \"100%\"\n! System Services\n! Description\n|-dsafassafasfas\n| '''Logging'''\n| The [[Java logging framework|logging]] of information, warnings, debug information or errors is handled through the Log Service. It receives log entries and then dispatches these entries to other bundles that subscribed to this information.\n|-\n| '''Configuration Admin'''\n| This service allows an operator to set and get the configuration information of deployed bundles\n|-\n| '''Device Access'''\n| Facilitates the coordination of automatic detection and attachment of existing devices. This is used for Plug and Play scenarios.\n|-\n| '''User Admin'''\n| This service uses a database with user information (private and public) for authentication and authorization purposes.\n|-\n| '''IO Connector'''\n| The IO Connector Service implements the [[Connected Device Configuration|CDC]]/[[CLDC]] <code>[http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr118/javax/microedition/io/package-summary.html javax.microedition.io]</code> package as a service. This service allows bundles to provide new and alternative protocol schemes.\n|-\n| '''Preferences'''\n| Offers an alternative, more OSGi-friendly mechanism to using Java's default {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|Properties}} for storing preferences.\n|-\n| '''Component Runtime'''\n| The dynamic nature of services\u2014they can come and go at any time\u2014makes writing software harder. The Component Runtime specification can simplify handling these dynamic aspects by providing an XML based declaration of the dependencies.\n|-\n| '''Deployment Admin'''\n| Standardizes access to some of the responsibilities of the management agent.\n|-\n| '''Event Admin'''\n| Provides an inter-bundle communication mechanism based on a publish-and-subscribe model.\n|-\n| '''Application Admin'''\n| Simplifies the management of an environment with many different types of applications that are simultaneously available.\n|}\nThe table below shows a description of OSGi Protocol Services:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width = \"100%\"\n!

Description\n|-\n| '''HTTP Service'''\n| Allows information to be sent and received from OSGi using [[HTTP]].\n|-\n| '''UPnP Device Service'''\n| Specifies how OSGi bundles can be developed to interoperate with [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) devices.\n|-\n| '''DMT Admin'''\n| Defines an API for managing a device using concepts from the [[Open Mobile Alliance]] (OMA) device management specifications.\n|}\nThe table below shows a description of OSGi Miscellaneous Services:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width = \"100%\"\n! Miscellaneous Services\n! Description\n|-\n| '''Wire Admin'''\n| Allows the connection between a Producer service and a Consumer service.\n|-\n| '''XML Parser'''\n| The XML Parser service allows a bundle to locate a parser with desired properties and compatibility with [[JAXP]].\n|-\n| '''Measurement and State'''\n| The Measurement and State service allows and simplifies the correct handling of measurements in an OSGi service platform.\n|}\n\n== Organization ==\nThe OSGi Alliance was founded by [[Ericsson]], [[International Business Machines|IBM]], [[Motorola]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and others in March 1999. Before incorporating as a nonprofit corporation, it was called the Connected Alliance.\n\nAmong its members are ({{As of|2015|alt=as of February 2015}}) more than 35 companies from quite different business areas, for example [[Adobe Systems]], [[Deutsche Telekom]], [[Hitachi]], [[International Business Machines|IBM]], [[Liferay]], Makewave, [[NEC]], [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Orange S.A.]], [[ProSyst]], [[Salesforce.com]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Software AG]] and [[TIBCO Software]].<ref>[http://www.osgi.org/About/Members OSGi Alliance | About / Members]</ref>\n\nThe Alliance has a board of directors that provides the organization's overall governance.  OSGi officers have various roles and responsibilities in supporting the alliance. Technical work is conducted within Expert Groups (EGs) chartered by the board of directors, and non-technical work is conducted in various working groups and committees. The technical work conducted within Expert Groups include developing specifications, reference implementations, and compliance tests. These Expert Groups have produced five major releases of the OSGi specifications ({{as of|2012}}).\n\nDedicated Expert Groups exist for the enterprise, mobile, vehicle and the core platform areas.\n\nThe Enterprise Expert Group (EEG) is the newest EG and is addressing Enterprise / Server-side applications.\nIn November 2007 the Residential Expert Group (REG) started to work on specifications to remotely manage residential/home-gateways.\nIn October 2003, [[Nokia]], [[Motorola]], [[International Business Machines|IBM]], [[ProSyst]] and other OSGi members formed a Mobile Expert Group (MEG) that will specify a [[MIDP]]-based service platform for the next generation of smart mobile phones, addressing some of the needs that [[Connected Limited Device Configuration|CLDC]] cannot manage - other than [[Connected Device Configuration|CDC]]. MEG became part of OSGi as with R4.\n\n== Specification versions ==\n* OSGi Release 1 (R1): May 2000\n* OSGi Release 2 (R2): October 2001\n* OSGi Release 3 (R3): March 2003\n* OSGi Release 4 (R4): October 2005 / September 2006\n** Core Specification (R4 Core): October 2005\n** Mobile Specification (R4 Mobile / JSR-232): September 2006\n* OSGi Release 4.1 (R4.1): May 2007 (AKA JSR-291)\n* OSGi Release 4.2 (R4.2): September 2009\n** Enterprise Specification (R4.2): March 2010\n* OSGi Release 4.3 (R4.3): April 2011\n** Core: April 2011\n** Compendium and Residential: May 2012\n* OSGi Release 5 (R5): June 2012\n** Core and Enterprise: June 2012\n* OSGi Release 6 (R6): June 2015\n** Core: June 2015\n* OSGi Release 7 (R7): April 2018\n** Core and Compendium: April 2018\n* OSGi Release 8 (R8): ''Draft'' March 2020<ref>\nhttps://blog.osgi.org/2020/03/osgi-core-r8-specification-available.html</ref>\n\n== Related standards ==\n*[[Multimedia Home Platform|MHP]] / [[OpenCable Application Platform|OCAP]]\n*[[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP)\n*[[DPWS]]\n*[[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]]\n*[[LonWorks]]\n*[[CORBA]]\n*[[CEBus]]\n*[[European Home Systems Protocol|EHS]] ([[KNX (standard)|KNX]]) / CECED [[CHAIN (industry standard)|CHAIN]]\n*[[Java Management Extensions]]\n\n== Projects using OSGi ==\n* [[Adobe Experience Manager]] -

organization founded in March 1999 that originally specified and continues to maintain the '''OSGi standard'''.\n\nThe '''OSGi specification''' describes a modular system and a [[Service (systems architecture)|service]] platform for the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming language that implements a complete and dynamic [[component model]], something that does not exist in standalone Java/[[Virtual machine|VM]] environments. [[Application software|Applications]] or components, coming in the form of [[#Bundles|bundle]]s for [[software deployment|deployment]], can be remotely installed, started, stopped, updated, and uninstalled without requiring a [[Reboot (computer)|reboot]]; management of [[Java package]]s/[[class (computer science)|class]]es is specified in great detail. Application life cycle management is implemented via APIs that allow for remote [[downloading]] of management policies. The service registry allows bundles to detect the addition of new services, or the removal of services, and adapt accordingly.\n\nThe OSGi specifications have evolved beyond the original focus of service gateways, and are now used in applications ranging from [[mobile phone]]s to the open-source [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse IDE]]. Other application areas include [[automobile]]s, [[industrial automation]], [[building automation]], [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDA]]s, [[grid computing]], [[entertainment]], [[fleet management]] and [[application server]]s.\n\n== Specification process ==\nThe OSGi specification is developed by the members in an open process and made available to the public free of charge under the OSGi Specification License.<ref>[http://www.osgi.org/Main/OSGiSpecificationLicense OSGi Specification License]</ref> The OSGi Alliance has a [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] program that is open to members only. As of November 2010, there are seven certified OSGi framework [[implementation]]s.<ref>https://www.osgi.org/osgi-compliance/osgi-certification/osgi-certified-products/</ref> A separate page lists both certified and non-certified [[OSGi Specification Implementations]], which include OSGi frameworks and other OSGi specifications.\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:Osgi framework.svg|thumb|250px|OSGi Service Gateway Architecture]]\nOSGi is a Java framework for developing and deploying modular software programs and libraries. Each bundle is a tightly coupled, dynamically loadable collection of classes, jars, and configuration files that explicitly declare their external dependencies (if any).\n\nThe framework is conceptually divided into the following areas:\n;Bundles:Bundles are normal [[JAR (file format)|JAR]] components with extra manifest headers.\n;Services:The services layer connects bundles in a dynamic way by offering a publish-find-bind model for plain old Java interfaces ([[POJI]]s) or [[plain old Java object]]s (POJOs).\n;Services Registry:The [[application programming interface]] for management services.\n;Life-Cycle:The [[application programming interface]] for life cycle management (install, start, stop, update, and uninstall) for bundles.\n;Modules:The layer that defines encapsulation and declaration of dependencies (how a bundle can import and export code).\n;Security:The layer that handles the security aspects by limiting bundle functionality to pre-defined capabilities.\n;Execution Environment:Defines what methods and classes are available in a specific platform. There is no fixed list of execution environments, since it is subject to change as the [[Java Community Process]] creates new versions and editions of Java. However, the following set is currently supported by most OSGi implementations:\n:*[[Connected Device Configuration|CDC-1.0/Foundation-1.0]]\n:*[[Connected Device Configuration|CDC-1.1/Foundation-1.1]]\n:*OSGi/Minimum-1.0\n:*OSGi/Minimum-1.1\n:*JRE-1.1\n:*From J2SE-1.2 up to J2SE-1.6\n\n==Bundles==\n[[Image:osgi-system-layering.svg|thumb|Right|250px|Classification: OSGi]]\n\nA bundle is a group of Java classes and additional resources equipped with a detailed manifest <code>[[MANIFEST.MF]]</code> file on all its contents, as well as additional services needed to give the included group of Java classes more sophisticated behaviors, to the extent of deeming the entire aggregate a component.\n\nBelow is an example of a typical <code>[[MANIFEST.MF]]</code> file with OSGi Headers:\n<source lang=\"properties\" line>\n Bundle-Name: Hello World\n Bundle-SymbolicName: org.wikipedia.helloworld\n Bundle-Description: A Hello World bundle\n Bundle-ManifestVersion: 2\n Bundle-Version: 1.0.0\n Bundle-Activator: org.wikipedia.Activator\n Export-Package: org.wikipedia.helloworld;version=\"1.0.0\"\n Import-Package: org.osgi.framework;version=\"1.3.0\"\n</source>\nThe meaning of the contents in the example is as follows:<ref>[http://blog.springsource.com/2008/02/18/creating-osgi-bundles/ Creating OSGi bundles] by Costin Leau</ref>\n\n# '''Bundle-Name:''' Defines a human-readable name for this bundle, Simply assigns a short name to the bundle.\n# '''Bundle-SymbolicName:''' The only required header, this entry specifies a unique identifier for a bundle, based on the [[Reverse domain name notation|reverse domain name convention]] (used also by the [[java packages]]).\n# '''Bundle-Description:''' A description of the bundle's functionality.\n# '''Bundle-ManifestVersion:''' Indicates the OSGi specification to use for reading this bundle.\n# '''Bundle-Version:''' Designates a version number to the bundle.\n# '''Bundle-Activator:''' Indicates the class name to be invoked once a bundle is activated.\n# '''Export-Package:''' Expresses which Java packages contained in a bundle will be made available to the outside world.\n# '''Import-Package:''' Indicates which Java packages will be required from the outside world to fulfill the dependencies needed in a bundle.\n\n== Life-cycle ==\n[[Image:OSGi Bundle Life-Cycle.svg|thumb|Right|250px|OSGi Bundle Life-Cycle]]\nA Life Cycle layer adds bundles that can be dynamically installed, started, stopped, updated and uninstalled. Bundles rely on the module layer for class loading but add an API to manage the modules in run time. The life cycle layer introduces dynamics that are normally not part of an application. Extensive dependency mechanisms are used to assure the correct operation of the environment. Life cycle operations are fully protected with the security architecture.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Bundle State\n! Description\n|-\n| '''INSTALLED'''\n| The bundle has been successfully installed.\n|-\n| '''RESOLVED'''\n| All Java classes that the bundle needs are available. This state indicates that the bundle is either ready to be started or has stopped.\n|-\n| '''STARTING'''\n| The bundle is being started, the <code>[http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v41/org/osgi/framework/BundleActivator.html#start(org.osgi.framework.BundleContext) BundleActivator.start]</code> method has been called but the start method has not yet returned. When the bundle has an activation policy, the bundle will remain in the STARTING state until the bundle is activated according to its activation policy.\n|-\n| '''ACTIVE'''\n| The bundle has been successfully activated and is running; its Bundle Activator start method has been called and returned.\n|-\n| '''STOPPING'''\n| The bundle is being stopped. The <code>[http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v41/org/osgi/framework/BundleActivator.html#stop(org.osgi.framework.BundleContext) BundleActivator.stop]</code> method has been called but the stop method has not yet returned.\n|-\n| '''UNINSTALLED'''\n| The bundle has been uninstalled. It cannot move into another state.\n|}\nBelow is an example of a typical Java class implementing the <code>[http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/framework/BundleActivator.html BundleActivator]</code> interface:\n<source lang=\"java\">\npackage org.wikipedia;\n\nimport org.osgi.framework.BundleActivator;\nimport org.osgi.framework.BundleContext;\n\npublic class Activator implements BundleActivator {\n\tprivate BundleContext context;\n\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void start(BundleContext context) throws Exception {\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Starting: Hello World\");\n\t\tthis.context = context;\n\t}\n\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void stop(BundleContext context) throws Exception {\n\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Stopping: Goodbye Cruel World\");\n\t\tthis.context = null;\n\t}\n}\n</source>\n\n==Services==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Standard services===\nThe OSGi Alliance has specified many services. Services are specified by a [[Java interface]]. Bundles can implement this interface and register the service with the Service Registry. Clients of the service can find it in the registry, or react to it when it appears or disappears.\n\nThe table below shows a description of OSGi System Services:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width = \"100%\"\n! System Services\n! Description\n|-dsafassafasfas\n| '''Logging'''\n| The [[Java logging framework|logging]] of information, warnings, debug information or errors is handled through the Log Service. It receives log entries and then dispatches these entries to other bundles that subscribed to this information.\n|-\n| '''Configuration Admin'''\n| This service allows an operator to set and get the configuration information of deployed bundles\n|-\n| '''Device Access'''\n| Facilitates the coordination of automatic detection and attachment of existing devices. This is used for Plug and Play scenarios.\n|-\n| '''User Admin'''\n| This service uses a database with user information (private and public) for authentication and authorization purposes.\n|-\n| '''IO Connector'''\n| The IO Connector Service implements the [[Connected Device Configuration|CDC]]/[[CLDC]] <code>[http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr118/javax/microedition/io/package-summary.html javax.microedition.io]</code> package as a service. This service allows bundles to provide new and alternative protocol schemes.\n|-\n| '''Preferences'''\n| Offers an alternative, more OSGi-friendly mechanism to using Java\u2019s default {{Javadoc:SE|java/util|Properties}} for storing preferences.\n|-\n| '''Component Runtime'''\n| The dynamic nature of services\u2014they can come and go at any time\u2014makes writing software harder. The Component Runtime specification can simplify handling these dynamic aspects by providing an XML based declaration of the dependencies.\n|-\n| '''Deployment Admin'''\n| Standardizes access to some of the responsibilities of the management agent.\n|-\n| '''Event Admin'''\n| Provides an inter-bundle communication mechanism based on a publish-and-subscribe model.\n|-\n| '''Application Admin'''\n| Simplifies the management of an environment with many different types of applications that are simultaneously available.\n|}\nThe table below shows a description of OSGi Protocol Services:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width = \"100%\"\n! Protocol Services\n! Description\n|-\n| '''HTTP Service'''\n| Allows information to be sent and received from OSGi using [[HTTP]].\n|-\n| '''UPnP Device Service'''\n| Specifies how OSGi bundles can be developed to interoperate with [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) devices.\n|-\n| '''DMT Admin'''\n| Defines an API for managing a device using concepts from the [[Open Mobile Alliance]] (OMA) device management specifications.\n|}\nThe table below shows a description of OSGi Miscellaneous Services:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width = \"100%\"\n! Miscellaneous Services\n! Description\n|-\n| '''Wire Admin'''\n| Allows the connection between a Producer service and a Consumer service.\n|-\n| '''XML Parser'''\n| The XML Parser service allows a bundle to locate a parser with desired properties and compatibility with [[JAXP]].\n|-\n| '''Measurement and State'''\n| The Measurement and State service allows and simplifies the correct handling of measurements in an OSGi service platform.\n|}\n\n== Organization ==\nThe OSGi Alliance was founded by [[Ericsson]], [[International Business Machines|IBM]], [[Motorola]], [[Sun Microsystems]] and others in March 1999. Before incorporating as a nonprofit corporation, it was called the Connected Alliance.\n\nAmong its members are ({{As of|2015|alt=as of February 2015}}) more than 35 companies from quite different business areas, for example [[Adobe Systems]], [[Deutsche Telekom]], [[Hitachi]], [[International Business Machines|IBM]], [[Liferay]], Makewave, [[NEC]], [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Orange S.A.]], [[ProSyst]], [[Salesforce.com]], [[Siemens AG|Siemens]], [[Software AG]] and [[TIBCO Software]].<ref>[http://www.osgi.org/About/Members OSGi Alliance | About / Members]</ref>\n\nThe Alliance has a board of directors that provides the organization's overall governance.  OSGi officers have various roles and responsibilities in supporting the alliance. Technical work is conducted within Expert Groups (EGs) chartered by the board of directors, and non-technical work is conducted in various working groups and committees. The technical work conducted within Expert Groups include developing specifications, reference implementations, and compliance tests. These Expert Groups have produced five major releases of the OSGi specifications ({{as of|2012}}).\n\nDedicated Expert Groups exist for the enterprise, mobile, vehicle and the core platform areas.\n\nThe Enterprise Expert Group (EEG) is the newest EG and is addressing Enterprise / Server-side applications.\nIn November 2007 the Residential Expert Group (REG) started to work on specifications to remotely manage residential/home-gateways.\nIn October 2003, [[Nokia]], [[Motorola]], [[International Business Machines|IBM]], [[ProSyst]] and other OSGi members formed a Mobile Expert Group (MEG) that will specify a [[MIDP]]-based service platform for the next generation of smart mobile phones, addressing some of the needs that [[Connected Limited Device Configuration|CLDC]] cannot manage - other than [[Connected Device Configuration|CDC]]. MEG became part of OSGi as with R4.\n\n== Specification versions ==\n* OSGi Release 1 (R1): May 2000\n* OSGi Release 2 (R2): October 2001\n* OSGi Release 3 (R3): March 2003\n* OSGi Release 4 (R4): October 2005 / September 2006\n** Core Specification (R4 Core): October 2005\n** Mobile Specification (R4 Mobile / JSR-232): September 2006\n* OSGi Release 4.1 (R4.1): May 2007 (AKA JSR-291)\n* OSGi Release 4.2 (R4.2): September 2009\n** Enterprise Specification (R4.2): March 2010\n* OSGi Release 4.3 (R4.3): April 2011\n** Core: April 2011\n** Compendium and Residential: May 2012\n* OSGi Release 5 (R5): June 2012\n** Core and Enterprise: June 2012\n* OSGi Release 6 (R6): June 2015\n** Core: June 2015\n* OSGi Release 7 (R7): April 2018\n** Core and Compendium: April 2018\n* OSGi Release 8 (R8): ''Draft'' March 2020<ref>\nhttps://blog.osgi.org/2020/03/osgi-core-r8-specification-available.html</ref>\n\n== Related standards ==\n*[[Multimedia Home Platform|MHP]] / [[OpenCable Application Platform|OCAP]]\n*[[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP)\n*[[DPWS]]\n*[[ITU-T]] [[G.hn]]\n*[[LonWorks]]\n*[[CORBA]]\n*[[CEBus]]\n*[[European Home Systems Protocol|EHS]] ([[KNX (standard)|KNX]]) / CECED [[CHAIN (industry standard)|CHAIN]]\n*[[Java Management Extensions]]\n\n== Projects using OSGi ==\n* [[Adobe Experience Manager]] -

The Yellow Emperor is traditionally credited to have united with the neighbouring [[Shennong]] tribes after defeating their leader, the [[Yan Emperor]], at the [[Battle of Banquan]]. The newly merged [[Yanhuang]] tribes then combined forces to defeat their common enemy from the east, [[Chiyou]] of the Jiuli ({{lang|zh|\u4e5d\u9ece}}) tribes, at the [[Battle of Zhuolu]], and established their cultural dominance in the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] region.  To this day, modern Han Chinese refer themselves as \"[[Yan Huang Zisun|Descendants of Yan and Huang]]\".\n\nAlthough study of this period of history is complicated by the absence of contemporary records, the discovery of [[archaeological site]]s has enabled a succession of [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|neolithic cultures]] to be identified along the Yellow River. Along the central reaches of the Yellow River were the [[Jiahu]] culture (c. 7000 to 6600 BCE), the [[Yangshao culture]] (c. 5000 to 3000 BCE) and the [[Longshan culture]] (c. 3000 to 2000 BCE). Along the lower reaches of the river were the Qingliangang culture (c. 5400 to 4000 BCE), the [[Dawenkou culture]] (c. 4300 to 2500 BCE), and the [[Yueshi culture]] (c. 1900 to 1500 BCE).\n\n=== Early history ===\n{{Main|Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors}}\nEarly ancient Chinese history is largely legendary, consisting of mythical tales intertwined with sporadic annals written centuries to millennia later. Sima Qian's ''Records of the Grand Historian''  recorded a period following the Battle of Zhuolu, during the reign of successive generations of confederate overlords ({{zh|t=\u5171\u4e3b}}) known as the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]] (c. 2852\u20132070 BCE), who, allegedly, were elected to power among the tribes.  This is a period for which scant reliable archaeological evidence exists \u2013 these sovereigns are largely regarded as [[cultural hero]]es.\n\n==== Xia dynasty ====\n{{Main|Xia dynasty}}\nThe first dynasty to be described in Chinese historical records is the Xia dynasty (c. 2070\u20131600 BCE), established by [[Yu the Great]] after [[Emperor Shun]] abdicated leadership to reward Yu's work in taming the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]].  Yu's son, [[Qi of Xia|Qi]], managed to not only install himself as the next ruler, but also dictated his sons as heirs by default, making the Xia dynasty the first in recorded history where [[order of succession|genealogical succession]] was the norm.  The civilizational prosperity of the Xia dynasty at this time is thought to have given rise to the name \"Huaxia\" ({{zh|s=\u534e\u590f|t=\u83ef\u590f|p=Hu\u00e1 Xi\u00e0}}, \"the magnificent Xia\"), a term that was used ubiquitously throughout history to define the Chinese nation.<ref>{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to the Chinese Economy: The Driving Forces Behind Modern Day China  |last= Guo  |first=  Rongxing   |publisher= Wiley |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0-470-82604-1 |page=10}}</ref>\n\nConclusive archaeological evidence predating the 16th century BCE is, however, rarely available.  Recent efforts of the [[Xia\u2013Shang\u2013Zhou Chronology Project]] drew the connection between the [[Erlitou culture]] and the Xia dynasty, but scholars could not reach a consensus regarding the reliability of such history.\n\n==== Shang dynasty ====\n{{Main|Shang dynasty}}\nThe Xia dynasty was overthrown after the [[Battle of Mingtiao]], around 1750 BCE, by [[Cheng Tang]], who established the Shang dynasty (c. 1750\u20131046 BCE).  The earliest archaeological examples of Chinese writing date back to this period \u2013 from characters inscribed on [[oracle bone]]s used for divination \u2013 but the well-developed characters hint at a much earlier origin of writing in China.\n\nDuring the Shang dynasty, people of the [[Wu (region)|Wu area]] in the [[Yangtze River Delta]], were considered a different tribe, and described as being scantily dressed, tattooed and speaking a distinct language. Later, [[Taibo of Wu|Taibo]], elder uncle of [[King Wen of Zhou|Ji Chang]] \u2013 on realising that his younger brother, Jili, was wiser and deserved to inherit the throne \u2013 fled to Wu<ref name=\"chinaknowledge.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/rulers-wu.html|title=The Feudal State of Wu \u5433 (www.chinaknowledge.de)|first=Ulrich|last=Theobald|website=Chinaknowledge.de|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref> and settled there.

The [[Zhou dynasty]] shared the language and culture of the Shang people, and extended their reach to encompass much of the area north of the [[Yangtze River]].<ref>{{cite web|title= China The Zhou Period|url= http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_chinathezhouperiod.htm|website=Ancienthistory.about.com|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"China The Zhou Period\">{{cite web|title= China The Zhou Period|url= http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cn0015)|website=Lcweb2.loc.gov|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>  Through conquest and colonization, much of this area came under the influence of sinicization, and this culture extended south.<ref name=\"China The Zhou Period\"/>  However, the power of the Zhou kings fragmented not long afterwards, and many autonomous vassal states emerged.  This dynasty is traditionally divided into two eras \u2013 the Western Zhou (1046\u2013771 BCE) and the [[Eastern Zhou]] (770\u2013256 BCE) \u2013 with the latter further divided into the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] (770\u2013476 BCE) and the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] (476\u2013221 BCE) periods.  It was a period of significant cultural and philosophical diversification (known as the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]) and [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] are among the most important surviving philosophies from this era.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n=== Imperial history ===\n\n==== Qin dynasty ====\n{{Main|Qin dynasty}}\nThe chaotic Warring States period of the Eastern Zhou dynasty came to an end with the unification of China by the western state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] after its [[Qin's wars of unification|conquest of all other rival states]]{{when|date=February 2015}} under King [[Ying Zheng]].  King Zheng then gave himself a new title \"[[First Emperor of Qin]]\" ({{zh|c=\u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d|p=Q\u00edn Sh\u01d0 Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec}}), setting the precedent for the next two millennia.  To consolidate administrative control over the newly conquered parts of the country, the First Emperor decreed a nationwide standardization of currency, writing scripts, and measurement units, to unify the country economically and culturally.  He also ordered large-scale infrastructure projects such as the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], the [[Lingqu Canal]] and the Qin road system to militarily fortify the frontiers.  In effect, he established a centralized bureaucratic state to replace the old feudal confederation system of preceding dynasties, making Qin the first [[Qin dynasty|imperial dynasty]] in Chinese history.\n\nThis dynasty, sometimes phonetically spelt as the \"Ch'in dynasty\", has been proposed in the 17th century by [[Martin Martini]] and supported by later scholars such as [[Paul Pelliot]] and [[Berthold Laufer]] to be the etymological origin of the modern English word \"China\".\n\n==== Han dynasty ====\n{{Main|Han dynasty}}\n[[File:China.Terracotta statues007.jpg|thumb|upright|A female servant and male advisor dressed in [[Han Chinese clothing|silk robes]], ceramic figurines from the Western Han era]]\n\nThe reign of the first imperial dynasty was to be short-lived. Due to the First Emperor's autocratic rule and his massive labor projects, which fomented rebellion among the populace, the Qin dynasty fell into chaos soon after his death. Under the corrupt rule of his son and successor [[Huhai]], the Qin dynasty collapsed a mere three years later. The Han dynasty (206 BC\u2013220 CE) then emerged from the ensuing [[Chu-Han contention|civil wars]] and succeeded in establishing a much longer-lasting dynasty.  It continued many of the institutions created by the Qin dynasty, but adopted a more moderate rule. Under the Han dynasty, arts and culture flourished, while the Han Empire [[History of the Han dynasty|expanded militarily in all directions]]. Many Chinese scholars such as [[Ho Ping-ti]] believe that the concept ([[ethnogenesis]]) of Han ethnicity, though an ancient one, was formally entrenched in the Han dynasty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claytonbrown.org|title=Clayton D. Brown Research on Chinese History: Ethnology, Archaeology, and Han Identity|website=Claytonbrown.org|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref> The Han dynasty is considered one of the [[golden age]]s of Chinese history, and to this day, the modern Han Chinese people have since taken their ethnic name from this dynasty and the Chinese script is referred to as \"[[Chinese characters|Han characters]]\".{{sfnp|Schaefer|2008|p=279}}\n\n==== Three Kingdoms to Tang ====\n{{Main|Three Kingdoms|Sixteen Kingdoms|Southern and Northern Dynasties|Sui dynasty|Tang dynasty}}\n[[File:China, 742.svg|320px|thumb|Map of Tang China in 742, showing the [[Administrative divisions of the Tang dynasty|major provinces]] of the empire|alt=]]The fall of the Han dynasty was followed by an age of fragmentation and several centuries of disunity amid warfare among rival kingdoms. During this time, areas of northern China were overrun by [[Five Barbarians|various non-Han nomadic peoples]], which came to establish kingdoms of their own, the most successful of which was [[Northern Wei]] (established by the [[Xianbei]]). Starting from this period, the native population of China proper began to be referred to as Hanren, or the \"People of Han\", to distinguish them from the nomads from the steppe. Warfare and invasion led to one of the first great migrations of Han populations in history, as they fled south to the [[Yangtze|Yangzi]] and beyond, shifting the Chinese demographic center and speeding up sinicization of the far south. At the same time most of the nomads in northern China came to be sinicized as they ruled over large Chinese populations and adopted elements of their culture and administration. Of note, the Xianbei rulers of Northern Wei ordered a policy of systematic sinicization, [[Change of Xianbei names to Han names|adopting Han surnames]], institutions, and culture.\n\nThe Sui (581\u2013618) and Tang (618\u2013907) dynasties saw the continuation of the complete sinicization of the south coast of what is now China proper, including what are now the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]]. The later part of the Tang era, as well as the Five Dynasties period that followed, saw continual warfare in north and central China; the relative stability of the south coast made it an attractive destination for refugees.\n\n==== Song to Qing ====\n{{Main|Song dynasty|Yuan dynasty|Ming dynasty|Qing dynasty}}\n[[File:Boxer queue.JPG|thumb|Han Chinese man wears a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] in compliance with Manchu custom during the Qing dynasty]]\nThe next few centuries saw successive invasions of Han and non-Han peoples from the north. In 1279, the [[Mongols]] conquered all of China, becoming the first non-Han ethnic group to do so, and established the [[Yuan dynasty]]. The Mongols divided society into four classes, with themselves occupying the top class and Han Chinese into the bottom two classes. [[Emigration]], seen as disloyal to ancestors and ancestral land, was banned by the Song and Yuan dynasties.<ref>{{Cite book|first = P\u00e1l|last = Ny\u00edri|first2 =  Igor\u02b9|last2 = Rostislavovich Savel\u02b9ev|title = Globalizing Chinese migration: trends in Europe and Asia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=77F23y4RrnUC&pg=PA208&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false|publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year = 2002|page = 208|isbn = 978-0-7546-1793-8}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1644, the Ming capital, [[Beijing]], was captured by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasant rebels and the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide. The [[Manchu people|Manchus]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] then allied with former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and seized control of Beijing. Remnant Ming forces led by [[Koxinga]] fled to [[Taiwan]] and established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], which eventually capitulated to Qing forces in 1683. Taiwan, previously inhabited mostly by non-Han aborigines, was sinicized during this period via large-scale migration accompanied by assimilation, despite efforts by the Manchus to prevent this, as they found it difficult to maintain control over the island. In 1681, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] ordered construction of the [[Willow Palisade]] to prevent Han Chinese migration to the three northeastern provinces, which nevertheless had harbored a significant Chinese population for centuries, especially in the southern [[Liaodong]] area. The Manchus designated Jilin and Heilongjiang as the Manchu homeland, to which the Manchus could hypothetically escape and regroup if the Qing dynasty fell.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Mark C. |last1=Elliott |date=August 2000 |title=The Limits of Tartary: Manchuria in Imperial and National Geographies |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=603\u201346 |jstor=2658945 |doi=10.2307/2658945|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e8f4099cf98dc5bebc32205a4b8ed91689dfc70b }}</ref> Because of increasing Russian territorial encroachment and annexation of neighboring territory, the Qing later reversed its policy and allowed the consolidation of a demographic Han majority in northeast China.\n\n== Culture and society==\n{{Main|Chinese culture}}\n\nChina is one of the world's oldest and most complex [[civilization]]s, whose culture dates back thousands of years. Overseas Han Chinese maintain cultural affinities to Chinese territories outside of their host locale through [[ancestor worship]] and [[Chinese clan|clan]] associations, which often identify famous figures from Chinese history or myth as ancestors of current members.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> Such patriarchs include the Yellow Emperor and the [[Yan Emperor]], who according to legend lived thousands of years ago and gave Han people the sobriquet \"''[[Descendants of Yan and Huang Emperor]]''\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u708e\u9ec3\u5b50\u5b6b}}; {{lang|zh-hans|\u708e\u9ec4\u5b50\u5b59}}), a phrase which has reverberative connotations in a divisive political climate, as in that of between [[Cross-Strait relations|Mainland China and Taiwan]].

Since the start of the program in 2001, aspects of Chinese culture have been listed by [[UNESCO]] as [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]. Throughout the [[history of China]], Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]]. Credited with shaping much of Chinese thought, [[Confucianism]] was the official [[philosophy]] throughout most of [[Imperial Chinese|Imperial China]]'s history, institutionalizing values like [[filial piety]], which implied the performance of certain [[Li (Confucian)|shared rituals]]. Thus, villagers lavished on [[Chinese funeral rituals|funeral]] and [[Chinese wedding|wedding]] ceremonies that imitated the Confucian standards of the Emperors.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> Mastery of Confucian texts provided the primary criterion for [[Imperial examination|entry into the imperial bureaucracy]], but even those degree-holders who did not enter the bureaucracy or who left it held increased social influence in their home areas, contributing to the homogenizing of Han Chinese culture.

Indigenous Confucianism and Taoism share aspects of being a philosophy or a religion, and neither demand exclusive adherence, resulting in a culture of tolerance and [[syncretism]], where multiple religions or belief systems are often practiced in concert with local customs and traditions. Han Chinese culture has for long been influenced by [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, while in recent centuries Christianity has also gained a foothold among the population.{{Citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nChinese folk religion is a set of worship traditions of the ethnic deities of the Han people. It involves the worship of various figures in [[Chinese mythology]], folk heroes such as [[Guan Yu]] and [[Qu Yuan]], mythological creatures such as the [[Chinese dragon]], or family, clan and national ancestors. These practices vary from region to region, and do not characterize an organized religion, though many [[traditional Chinese holidays]] such as the [[Duanwu Festival|Duanwu (or Dragon Boat) Festival]], [[Qingming Festival|Qingming]], and the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] come from the most popular of these traditions.\n\nTaoism, another indigenous religion, is also widely practiced in both its folk forms and as an organized religion, and has influenced Chinese art, poetry, philosophy, [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicine]], [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], alchemy and chemistry, cuisine, [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]], and [[Chinese architecture|architecture]]. Taoism was the state religion of the early Han Dynasty, and also often enjoyed state patronage under subsequent emperors and dynasties.\n\nConfucianism, although sometimes described as a religion, is a governing philosophy and moral code with some religious elements like ancestor worship. It is deeply ingrained in Chinese culture and was the official state philosophy in China during the Han Dynasty and unto the fall of imperial China in the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty, [[Confucian]] ideals were the dominant ideology.  Near the end of the dynasty, Buddhism entered China, later gaining popularity. Historically, Buddhism alternated between periods of state tolerance (and even patronage) and [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|persecution]]. In its original form, Buddhism was at odds with the native Chinese religions, especially with the elite, as certain Buddhist values often conflicted with Chinese sensibilities. However, through centuries of assimilation, adaptation, and syncretism, [[Chinese Buddhism]] gained an accepted place in the culture. Mahayana would come to be influenced by Confucianism and Taoism, and exerted influence in turn \u2013 such as in the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]].\n\nThough [[Christianity in China|Christian influence in China]] existed as early as the 7th century, Christianity did not begin to gain a significant foothold in China until the establishment of contact with Europeans during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties. Chinese practices at odds with Christian beliefs resulted in the [[Chinese Rites controversy]], and a subsequent reduction in Christian influence.

The Yellow Emperor is traditionally credited to have united with the neighbouring [[Shennong]] tribes after defeating their leader, the [[Yan Emperor]], at the [[Battle of Banquan]]. The newly merged [[Yanhuang]] tribes then combined forces to defeat their common enemy from the east, [[Chiyou]] of the Jiuli ({{lang|zh|\u4e5d\u9ece}}) tribes, at the [[Battle of Zhuolu]], and established their cultural dominance in the [[Central Plain (China)|Central Plain]] region.  To this day, modern Han Chinese refer themselves as \"[[Yan Huang Zisun|Descendants of Yan and Huang]]\".\n\nAlthough study of this period of history is complicated by the absence of contemporary records, the discovery of [[archaeological site]]s has enabled a succession of [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|neolithic cultures]] to be identified along the Yellow River. Along the central reaches of the Yellow River were the [[Jiahu]] culture (c. 7000 to 6600 BCE), the [[Yangshao culture]] (c. 5000 to 3000 BCE) and the [[Longshan culture]] (c. 3000 to 2000 BCE). Along the lower reaches of the river were the Qingliangang culture (c. 5400 to 4000 BCE), the [[Dawenkou culture]] (c. 4300 to 2500 BCE), and the [[Yueshi culture]] (c. 1900 to 1500 BCE).\n\n=== Early history ===\n{{Main|Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors}}\nEarly ancient Chinese history is largely legendary, consisting of mythical tales intertwined with sporadic annals written centuries to millennia later. Sima Qian's ''Records of the Grand Historian''  recorded a period following the Battle of Zhuolu, during the reign of successive generations of confederate overlords ({{zh|t=\u5171\u4e3b}}) known as the [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]] (c. 2852\u20132070 BCE), who, allegedly, were elected to power among the tribes.  This is a period for which scant reliable archaeological evidence exists \u2013 these sovereigns are largely regarded as [[cultural hero]]es.\n\n==== Xia dynasty ====\n{{Main|Xia dynasty}}\nThe first dynasty to be described in Chinese historical records is the Xia dynasty (c. 2070\u20131600 BCE), established by [[Yu the Great]] after [[Emperor Shun]] abdicated leadership to reward Yu's work in taming the [[Great Flood (China)|Great Flood]].  Yu's son, [[Qi of Xia|Qi]], managed to not only install himself as the next ruler, but also dictated his sons as heirs by default, making the Xia dynasty the first in recorded history where [[order of succession|genealogical succession]] was the norm.  The civilizational prosperity of the Xia dynasty at this time is thought to have given rise to the name \"Huaxia\" ({{zh|s=\u534e\u590f|t=\u83ef\u590f|p=Hu\u00e1 Xi\u00e0}}, \"the magnificent Xia\"), a term that was used ubiquitously throughout history to define the Chinese nation.<ref>{{Cite book |title=An Introduction to the Chinese Economy: The Driving Forces Behind Modern Day China  |last= Guo  |first=  Rongxing   |publisher= Wiley |year= 2010 |isbn= 978-0-470-82604-1 |page=10}}</ref>\n\nConclusive archaeological evidence predating the 16th century BCE is, however, rarely available.  Recent efforts of the [[Xia\u2013Shang\u2013Zhou Chronology Project]] drew the connection between the [[Erlitou culture]] and the Xia dynasty, but scholars could not reach a consensus regarding the reliability of such history.\n\n==== Shang dynasty ====\n{{Main|Shang dynasty}}\nThe Xia dynasty was overthrown after the [[Battle of Mingtiao]], around 1750 BCE, by [[Cheng Tang]], who established the Shang dynasty (c. 1750\u20131046 BCE).  The earliest archaeological examples of Chinese writing date back to this period \u2013 from characters inscribed on [[oracle bone]]s used for divination \u2013 but the well-developed characters hint at a much earlier origin of writing in China.\n\nDuring the Shang dynasty, people of the [[Wu (region)|Wu area]] in the [[Yangtze River Delta]], were considered a different tribe, and described as being scantily dressed, tattooed and speaking a distinct language. Later, [[Taibo of Wu|Taibo]], elder uncle of [[King Wen of Zhou|Ji Chang]] \u2013 on realising that his younger brother, Jili, was wiser and deserved to inherit the throne \u2013 fled to Wu<ref name=\"chinaknowledge.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/rulers-wu.html|title=The Feudal State of Wu \u5433 (www.chinaknowledge.de)|first=Ulrich|last=Theobald|website=Chinaknowledge.de|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref> and settled there.

The [[Zhou dynasty]] shared the language and culture of the Shang people, and extended their reach to encompass much of the area north of the [[Yangtze River]].<ref>{{cite web|title= China The Zhou Period|url= http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_chinathezhouperiod.htm|website=Ancienthistory.about.com|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"China The Zhou Period\">{{cite web|title= China The Zhou Period|url= http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cn0015)|website=Lcweb2.loc.gov|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>  Through conquest and colonization, much of this area came under the influence of sinicization, and this culture extended south.<ref name=\"China The Zhou Period\"/>  However, the power of the Zhou kings fragmented not long afterwards, and many autonomous vassal states emerged.  This dynasty is traditionally divided into two eras \u2013 the Western Zhou (1046\u2013771 BCE) and the [[Eastern Zhou]] (770\u2013256 BCE) \u2013 with the latter further divided into the [[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]] (770\u2013476 BCE) and the [[Warring States period|Warring States]] (476\u2013221 BCE) periods.  It was a period of significant cultural and philosophical diversification (known as the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]]) and [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] are among the most important surviving philosophies from this era.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n=== Imperial history ===\n\n==== Qin dynasty ====\n{{Main|Qin dynasty}}\nThe chaotic Warring States period of the Eastern Zhou dynasty came to an end with the unification of China by the western state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] after its [[Qin's wars of unification|conquest of all other rival states]]{{when|date=February 2015}} under King [[Ying Zheng]].  King Zheng then gave himself a new title \"[[First Emperor of Qin]]\" ({{zh|c=\u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d|p=Q\u00edn Sh\u01d0 Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec}}), setting the precedent for the next two millennia.  To consolidate administrative control over the newly conquered parts of the country, the First Emperor decreed a nationwide standardization of currency, writing scripts, and measurement units, to unify the country economically and culturally.  He also ordered large-scale infrastructure projects such as the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], the [[Lingqu Canal]] and the Qin road system to militarily fortify the frontiers.  In effect, he established a centralized bureaucratic state to replace the old feudal confederation system of preceding dynasties, making Qin the first [[Qin dynasty|imperial dynasty]] in Chinese history.\n\nThis dynasty, sometimes phonetically spelt as the \"Ch'in dynasty\", has been proposed in the 17th century by [[Martin Martini]] and supported by later scholars such as [[Paul Pelliot]] and [[Berthold Laufer]] to be the etymological origin of the modern English word \"China\".\n\n==== Han dynasty ====\n{{Main|Han dynasty}}\n[[File:China.Terracotta statues007.jpg|thumb|upright|A female servant and male advisor dressed in [[Han Chinese clothing|silk robes]], ceramic figurines from the Western Han era]]\n\nThe reign of the first imperial dynasty was to be short-lived. Due to the First Emperor's autocratic rule and his massive labor projects, which fomented rebellion among the populace, the Qin dynasty fell into chaos soon after his death. Under the corrupt rule of his son and successor [[Huhai]], the Qin dynasty collapsed a mere three years later. The Han dynasty (206 BC\u2013220 CE) then emerged from the ensuing [[Chu-Han contention|civil wars]] and succeeded in establishing a much longer-lasting dynasty.  It continued many of the institutions created by the Qin dynasty, but adopted a more moderate rule. Under the Han dynasty, arts and culture flourished, while the Han Empire [[History of the Han dynasty|expanded militarily in all directions]]. Many Chinese scholars such as [[Ho Ping-ti]] believe that the concept ([[ethnogenesis]]) of Han ethnicity, though an ancient one, was formally entrenched in the Han dynasty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claytonbrown.org|title=Clayton D. Brown Research on Chinese History: Ethnology, Archaeology, and Han Identity|website=Claytonbrown.org|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref> The Han dynasty is considered one of the [[golden age]]s of Chinese history, and to this day, the modern Han Chinese people have since taken their ethnic name from this dynasty and the Chinese script is referred to as \"[[Chinese characters|Han characters]]\".{{sfnp|Schaefer|2008|p=279}}\n\n==== Three Kingdoms to Tang ====\n{{Main|Three Kingdoms|Sixteen Kingdoms|Southern and Northern Dynasties|Sui dynasty|Tang dynasty}}\n[[File:China, 742.svg|320px|thumb|Map of Tang China in 742, showing the [[Administrative divisions of the Tang dynasty|major provinces]] of the empire|alt=]]The fall of the Han dynasty was followed by an age of fragmentation and several centuries of disunity amid warfare among rival kingdoms. During this time, areas of northern China were overrun by [[Five Barbarians|various non-Han nomadic peoples]], which came to establish kingdoms of their own, the most successful of which was [[Northern Wei]] (established by the [[Xianbei]]). Starting from this period, the native population of China proper began to be referred to as Hanren, or the \"People of Han\", to distinguish them from the nomads from the steppe. Warfare and invasion led to one of the first great migrations of Han populations in history, as they fled south to the [[Yangtze|Yangzi]] and beyond, shifting the Chinese demographic center and speeding up sinicization of the far south. At the same time most of the nomads in northern China came to be sinicized as they ruled over large Chinese populations and adopted elements of their culture and administration. Of note, the Xianbei rulers of Northern Wei ordered a policy of systematic sinicization, [[Change of Xianbei names to Han names|adopting Han surnames]], institutions, and culture.\n\nThe Sui (581\u2013618) and Tang (618\u2013907) dynasties saw the continuation of the complete sinicization of the south coast of what is now China proper, including what are now the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]]. The later part of the Tang era, as well as the Five Dynasties period that followed, saw continual warfare in north and central China; the relative stability of the south coast made it an attractive destination for refugees.\n\n==== Song to Qing ====\n{{Main|Song dynasty|Yuan dynasty|Ming dynasty|Qing dynasty}}\n[[File:Boxer queue.JPG|thumb|Han Chinese man wears a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] in compliance with Manchu custom during the Qing dynasty]]\nThe next few centuries saw successive invasions of Han and non-Han peoples from the north. In 1279, the [[Mongols]] conquered all of China, becoming the first non-Han ethnic group to do so, and established the [[Yuan dynasty]]. The Mongols divided society into four classes, with themselves occupying the top class and Han Chinese into the bottom two classes. [[Emigration]], seen as disloyal to ancestors and ancestral land, was banned by the Song and Yuan dynasties.<ref>{{Cite book|first = P\u00e1l|last = Ny\u00edri|first2 =  Igor\u02b9|last2 = Rostislavovich Savel\u02b9ev|title = Globalizing Chinese migration: trends in Europe and Asia|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=77F23y4RrnUC&pg=PA208&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false|publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year = 2002|page = 208|isbn = 978-0-7546-1793-8}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1644, the Ming capital, [[Beijing]], was captured by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasant rebels and the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide. The [[Manchu people|Manchus]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] then allied with former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and seized control of Beijing. Remnant Ming forces led by [[Koxinga]] fled to [[Taiwan]] and established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], which eventually capitulated to Qing forces in 1683. Taiwan, previously inhabited mostly by non-Han aborigines, was sinicized during this period via large-scale migration accompanied by assimilation, despite efforts by the Manchus to prevent this, as they found it difficult to maintain control over the island. In 1681, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] ordered construction of the [[Willow Palisade]] to prevent Han Chinese migration to the three northeastern provinces, which nevertheless had harbored a significant Chinese population for centuries, especially in the southern [[Liaodong]] area. The Manchus designated Jilin and Heilongjiang as the Manchu homeland, to which the Manchus could hypothetically escape and regroup if the Qing dynasty fell.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Mark C. |last1=Elliott |date=August 2000 |title=The Limits of Tartary: Manchuria in Imperial and National Geographies |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=603\u201346 |jstor=2658945 |doi=10.2307/2658945|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e8f4099cf98dc5bebc32205a4b8ed91689dfc70b }}</ref> Because of increasing Russian territorial encroachment and annexation of neighboring territory, the Qing later reversed its policy and allowed the consolidation of a demographic Han majority in northeast China.\n\n== Culture and society==\n{{Main|Chinese culture}}\n\nChina is one of the world's oldest and most complex [[civilization]]s, whose culture dates back thousands of years. Overseas Han Chinese maintain cultural affinities to Chinese territories outside of their host locale through [[ancestor worship]] and [[Chinese clan|clan]] associations, which often identify famous figures from Chinese history or myth as ancestors of current members.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> Such patriarchs include the Yellow Emperor and the [[Yan Emperor]], who according to legend lived thousands of years ago and gave Han people the sobriquet \"''[[Descendants of Yan and Huang Emperor]]''\" ({{lang|zh-hant|\u708e\u9ec3\u5b50\u5b6b}}; {{lang|zh-hans|\u708e\u9ec4\u5b50\u5b59}}), a phrase which has reverberative connotations in a divisive political climate, as in that of between [[Cross-Strait relations|Mainland China and Taiwan]].

Since the start of the program in 2001, aspects of Chinese culture have been listed by [[UNESCO]] as [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]. Throughout the [[history of China]], Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]]. Credited with shaping much of Chinese thought, [[Confucianism]] was the official [[philosophy]] throughout most of [[Imperial Chinese|Imperial China]]'s history, institutionalizing values like [[filial piety]], which implied the performance of certain [[Li (Confucian)|shared rituals]]. Thus, villagers lavished on [[Chinese funeral rituals|funeral]] and [[Chinese wedding|wedding]] ceremonies that imitated the Confucian standards of the Emperors.<ref name=\"Cohen\"/> Mastery of Confucian texts provided the primary criterion for [[Imperial examination|entry into the imperial bureaucracy]], but even those degree-holders who did not enter the bureaucracy or who left it held increased social influence in their home areas, contributing to the homogenizing of Han Chinese culture.

Indigenous Confucianism and Taoism share aspects of being a philosophy or a religion, and neither demand exclusive adherence, resulting in a culture of tolerance and [[syncretism]], where multiple religions or belief systems are often practiced in concert with local customs and traditions. Han Chinese culture has for long been influenced by [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, while in recent centuries Christianity has also gained a foothold among the population.{{Citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nChinese folk religion is a set of worship traditions of the ethnic deities of the Han people. It involves the worship of various figures in [[Chinese mythology]], folk heroes such as [[Guan Yu]] and [[Qu Yuan]], mythological creatures such as the [[Chinese dragon]], or family, clan and national ancestors. These practices vary from region to region, and do not characterize an organized religion, though many [[traditional Chinese holidays]] such as the [[Duanwu Festival|Duanwu (or Dragon Boat) Festival]], [[Qingming Festival|Qingming]], and the [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] come from the most popular of these traditions.\n\nTaoism, another indigenous religion, is also widely practiced in both its folk forms and as an organized religion, and has influenced Chinese art, poetry, philosophy, [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicine]], [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], alchemy and chemistry, cuisine, [[Chinese martial arts|martial arts]], and [[Chinese architecture|architecture]]. Taoism was the state religion of the early Han Dynasty, and also often enjoyed state patronage under subsequent emperors and dynasties.\n\nConfucianism, although sometimes described as a religion, is a governing philosophy and moral code with some religious elements like ancestor worship. It is deeply ingrained in Chinese culture and was the official state philosophy in China during the Han Dynasty and unto the fall of imperial China in the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date = November 2018}}\n\nDuring the Han Dynasty, [[Confucian]] ideals were the dominant ideology.  Near the end of the dynasty, Buddhism entered China, later gaining popularity. Historically, Buddhism alternated between periods of state tolerance (and even patronage) and [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|persecution]]. In its original form, Buddhism was at odds with the native Chinese religions, especially with the elite, as certain Buddhist values often conflicted with Chinese sensibilities. However, through centuries of assimilation, adaptation, and syncretism, [[Chinese Buddhism]] gained an accepted place in the culture. Mahayana would come to be influenced by Confucianism and Taoism, and exerted influence in turn \u2013 such as in the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]].\n\nThough [[Christianity in China|Christian influence in China]] existed as early as the 7th century, Christianity did not begin to gain a significant foothold in China until the establishment of contact with Europeans during the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] dynasties. Chinese practices at odds with Christian beliefs resulted in the [[Chinese Rites controversy]], and a subsequent reduction in Christian influence.

These lift jets would have been used during vertical takeoffs and landings, but would have been inactive during horizontal flight. The Mirage IIIV had come about as a response to the issuing of a [[NATO]] specification, NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 ([[NBMR-3]]), which sought a [[supersonic]]-capable VTOL strike fighter.\n\nThe Mirage IIIV was a competitor with [[Hawker Siddeley]]'s [[Hawker Siddeley P.1154|P.1154]] VTOL fighter, a cousin of the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]]. Both aircraft competed to be selected to meet the NBMR-3 requirement. While the Mirage IIIV is commonly viewed as being more politically palatable due to an emphasis having been placed upon multinational development and manufacturing plans, the design of P.1154 (which only used a single engine) was seen as more straightforward and practical. Ultimately the P.1154 was selected to meet the NBMR-3 requirement to the detriment of the Mirage IIIV. One of the two prototypes constructed was destroyed in an accident; shortly following its loss, the whole project was abandoned; the surviving aircraft has since been placed on public display.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Background===\nIn August&nbsp;1961, NATO released an updated revision of its VTOL strike fighter requirement, NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 ([[NBMR-3]]).<ref name=Jefford_12>Jefford 2006 et al., p.&nbsp;12.</ref> Specifications called for a supersonic V/STOL strike fighter with a [[combat radius]] of {{Convert|250|nmi|km|disp=flip}}. Cruise speed was to be Mach&nbsp;0.92, with a dash speed of Mach&nbsp;1.5.<ref name = \"wood 215\"/> The aircraft, with a {{Convert|2000|lb|kg|adj=on|disp=flip}} payload, had to be able to clear a {{Convert|50|ft|m|adj=on|disp=flip}} obstacle following a {{Convert|500|ft|m|adj=on|disp=flip}} takeoff roll.{{sfn|Jenkins|1998|p=19}}<ref name=buttler_118/> Victory in this competition was viewed being of a high importance at the time as it was seem as being potentially \"the first real NATO combat aircraft\".<ref name = \"wood 215\"/>\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960, both French aircraft manufacturer [[Dassault Aviation]] and British aerospace company [[Hawker Siddeley|Hawker Siddeley Aviation]] (HSA) were deeply interested in vertical takeoff/landing (VTOL)-capable combat aircraft. HSA had already been keen to develop a new generation of combat aircraft that would be capable of [[supersonic]] speeds.<ref name = \"wood 211 213\">Wood 1975, pp. 211-213.</ref> HSA's chief aircraft designer [[Sydney Camm|Sir Sydney Camm]] decided that the company should investigate the prospects of developing and manufacturing a viable combat-capable [[VTOL|vertical take-off and landing]] (VTOL) fighter aircraft.<ref name = \"wood 213\">Wood 1975, p. 213.</ref> Along with the subsonic [[Hawker P.1121]] fighter (which would become the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] later on, a supersonic design, designated as the ''P.1150'' was produced; however, the release of NBMR-3, and subsequent revisions to it, led to the P.1150 proposal being considered to be undersized and thus unsatisfactory, which led to a desire for a redesign.<ref name = \"wood 215\"/>{{#tag:ref|According to aviation author Derek Wood, the decision not to persist with the original P.1150 design was a \"serious setback...it would have provided a first class basic type\".<ref name = \"wood 215\"/>|group=N}} The new, larger aircraft design soon emerged, which was initially designated as ''P.1150/3'' prior to being redesignated as the ''P.1154''.<ref name=buttler_118>Buttler 2000, p.&nbsp;118.</ref>\n\nIn January 1962, HSA submitted the P.1154 design to NATO via the [[Ministry of Aviation]].<ref name = \"wood 215\">Wood 1975, p. 215.</ref> NBMR.3 attracted a total of eleven contenders, including Dassault's Mirage IIIV proposal, which would become viewed as the principal competitor to the  P.1154. Substantial support for the Mirage IIIV came from Britain, work on the programme having involved the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC), while the Dassault-led design also held the favour of several members of the British Air Staff.<ref name=buttler_119/><ref name = \"wood 215\"/> While the P.1154 was judged to be technically superior, the Mirage IIIV had acquired a greater level of political palatability due to the co-operative development and production aspects proposed for the programme, under which work was to be distributed across a number of member nations. Protracting political maneuvering by firms and national governments alike was deployed in attempts to secure their respective project's selection.<ref name = \"wood 216\">Wood 1975, p. 216.</ref>\n\nIn May 1962, the P.1154 emerged as the winner in the competition for the NBMR.3 over the Mirage IIIV.<ref name=buttler_119>Buttler 2000, p.&nbsp;119.</ref> While the Mirage IIIV had not been selected to meet NBMR-3, however this did not lead to orders for the rival P.1154 being placed.<ref name = \"wood 216\"/> The French government subsequently withdrew from participation once the Dassault design had not emerged victorious.<ref name=buttler_119/><ref name=Jefford_12-13>Jefford 2006 et al., pp.&nbsp;12\u201313.</ref> According to aviation author Jeffort, the Mirage IIIV had been rejected mainly because of its excessive complexity, using nine engines compared to the P.1154's single-engine approach.<ref name=Jefford_19>Jefford 2006 et al., p.&nbsp;19.</ref> However, NATO lacked any central budget, instead relying on individual member nations to actually procure military equipment, while the NBMR-3 selection went unheeded by all of the NATO member nations. Thus, in 1965, the whole NATO project was unceremoniously terminated.<ref name = \"wood 216\"/>\n\n===Dassault Balzac V===\n{{Main|Dassault Balzac V}}\n\nSince the [[Rolls-Royce RB162]] lift engines which had been specified for the Mirage IIIV were not expected to be available before 1963, Dassault decided to modify the first Mirage III prototype into an interim VTOL testbed; in this configuration, it became the [[Dassault Balzac V|Balzac V]]. This was fitted with eight [[Rolls-Royce RB.108]] lift engines along with a single [[Afterburner|unreheated]] [[Bristol Siddeley Orpheus|Bristol Orpheus]] BOr 3 as the main engine.<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%200766.html \"R-R for Dassault.\"] ''Flight International'', 17 May 1962. p. 764.</ref> According to aerospace publication [[Flight International]], a key goal for the Balzac prototype was to prove the autopilot system, which was identical to the unit which was proposed use with the Mirage IIIV, as well as the lift and transition system.<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%201348.html \"Balzac VTOL Forerunner of the Mirage IIIV.\"] ''Flight International'', 2 August 1962. pp. 174-175.</ref> The Balzac began tethered hovering on 12 October 1962 and achieved the first free hover only six days later. The first accelerating transition from vertical take-off to horizontal flight took place on its 17th sortie on 18 March 1963. The aircraft had two fatal accidents, one in January 1964 and one in September 1965.

These lift jets would have been used during vertical takeoffs and landings, but would have been inactive during horizontal flight. The Mirage IIIV had come about as a response to the issuing of a [[NATO]] specification, NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 ([[NBMR-3]]), which sought a [[supersonic]]-capable VTOL strike fighter.\n\nThe Mirage IIIV was a competitor with [[Hawker Siddeley]]'s [[Hawker Siddeley P.1154|P.1154]] VTOL fighter, a cousin of the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]]. Both aircraft competed to be selected to meet the NBMR-3 requirement. While the Mirage IIIV is commonly viewed as being more politically palatable due to an emphasis having been placed upon multinational development and manufacturing plans, the design of P.1154 (which only used a single engine) was seen as more straightforward and practical. Ultimately the P.1154 was selected to meet the NBMR-3 requirement to the detriment of the Mirage IIIV. One of the two prototypes constructed was destroyed in an accident; shortly following its loss, the whole project was abandoned; the surviving aircraft has since been placed on public display.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Background===\nIn August&nbsp;1961, NATO released an updated revision of its VTOL strike fighter requirement, NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 ([[NBMR-3]]).<ref name=Jefford_12>Jefford 2006 et al., p.&nbsp;12.</ref> Specifications called for a supersonic V/STOL strike fighter with a [[combat radius]] of {{Convert|250|nmi|km|disp=flip}}. Cruise speed was to be Mach&nbsp;0.92, with a dash speed of Mach&nbsp;1.5.<ref name = \"wood 215\"/> The aircraft, with a {{Convert|2000|lb|kg|adj=on|disp=flip}} payload, had to be able to clear a {{Convert|50|ft|m|adj=on|disp=flip}} obstacle following a {{Convert|500|ft|m|adj=on|disp=flip}} takeoff roll.{{sfn|Jenkins|1998|p=19}}<ref name=buttler_118/> Victory in this competition was viewed being of a high importance at the time as it was seem as being potentially \"the first real NATO combat aircraft\".<ref name = \"wood 215\"/>\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960, both French aircraft manufacturer [[Dassault Aviation]] and British aerospace company [[Hawker Siddeley|Hawker Siddeley Aviation]] (HSA) were deeply interested in vertical takeoff/landing (VTOL)-capable combat aircraft. HSA had already been keen to develop a new generation of combat aircraft that would be capable of [[supersonic]] speeds.<ref name = \"wood 211 213\">Wood 1975, pp. 211-213.</ref> HSA's chief aircraft designer [[Sydney Camm|Sir Sydney Camm]] decided that the company should investigate the prospects of developing and manufacturing a viable combat-capable [[VTOL|vertical take-off and landing]] (VTOL) fighter aircraft.<ref name = \"wood 213\">Wood 1975, p. 213.</ref> Along with the subsonic [[Hawker P.1121]] fighter (which would become the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] later on, a supersonic design, designated as the ''P.1150'' was produced; however, the release of NBMR-3, and subsequent revisions to it, led to the P.1150 proposal being considered to be undersized and thus unsatisfactory, which led to a desire for a redesign.<ref name = \"wood 215\"/>{{#tag:ref|According to aviation author Derek Wood, the decision not to persist with the original P.1150 design was a \"serious setback...it would have provided a first class basic type\".<ref name = \"wood 215\"/>|group=N}} The new, larger aircraft design soon emerged, which was initially designated as ''P.1150/3'' prior to being redesignated as the ''P.1154''.<ref name=buttler_118>Buttler 2000, p.&nbsp;118.</ref>\n\nIn January 1962, HSA submitted the P.1154 design to NATO via the [[Ministry of Aviation]].<ref name = \"wood 215\">Wood 1975, p. 215.</ref> NBMR.3 attracted a total of eleven contenders, including Dassault's Mirage IIIV proposal, which would become viewed as the principal competitor to the  P.1154. Substantial support for the Mirage IIIV came from Britain, work on the programme having involved the [[British Aircraft Corporation]] (BAC), while the Dassault-led design also held the favour of several members of the British Air Staff.<ref name=buttler_119/><ref name = \"wood 215\"/> While the P.1154 was judged to be technically superior, the Mirage IIIV had acquired a greater level of political palatability due to the co-operative development and production aspects proposed for the programme, under which work was to be distributed across a number of member nations. Protracting political maneuvering by firms and national governments alike was deployed in attempts to secure their respective project's selection.<ref name = \"wood 216\">Wood 1975, p. 216.</ref>\n\nIn May 1962, the P.1154 emerged as the winner in the competition for the NBMR.3 over the Mirage IIIV.<ref name=buttler_119>Buttler 2000, p.&nbsp;119.</ref> While the Mirage IIIV had not been selected to meet NBMR-3, however this did not lead to orders for the rival P.1154 being placed.<ref name = \"wood 216\"/> The French government subsequently withdrew from participation once the Dassault design had not emerged victorious.<ref name=buttler_119/><ref name=Jefford_12-13>Jefford 2006 et al., pp.&nbsp;12\u201313.</ref> According to aviation author Jeffort, the Mirage IIIV had been rejected mainly because of its excessive complexity, using nine engines compared to the P.1154's single-engine approach.<ref name=Jefford_19>Jefford 2006 et al., p.&nbsp;19.</ref> However, NATO lacked any central budget, instead relying on individual member nations to actually procure military equipment, while the NBMR-3 selection went unheeded by all of the NATO member nations. Thus, in 1965, the whole NATO project was unceremoniously terminated.<ref name = \"wood 216\"/>\n\n===Dassault Balzac V===\n{{Main|Dassault Balzac V}}\n\nSince the [[Rolls-Royce RB162]] lift engines which had been specified for the Mirage IIIV were not expected to be available before 1963, Dassault decided to modify the first Mirage III prototype into an interim VTOL testbed; in this configuration, it became the [[Dassault Balzac V|Balzac V]]. This was fitted with eight [[Rolls-Royce RB.108]] lift engines along with a single [[Afterburner|unreheated]] [[Bristol Siddeley Orpheus|Bristol Orpheus]] BOr 3 as the main engine.<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%200766.html \"R-R for Dassault.\"] ''Flight International'', 17 May 1962. p. 764.</ref> According to aerospace publication [[Flight International]], a key goal for the Balzac prototype was to prove the autopilot system, which was identical to the unit which was proposed use with the Mirage IIIV, as well as the lift and transition system.<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%201348.html \"Balzac VTOL Forerunner of the Mirage IIIV.\"] ''Flight International'', 2 August 1962. pp. 174-175.</ref> The Balzac began tethered hovering on 12 October 1962 and achieved the first free hover only six days later. The first accelerating transition from vertical take-off to horizontal flight took place on its 17th sortie on 18 March 1963. The aircraft had two fatal accidents, one in January 1964 and one in September 1965.

He grew up in a traditional Jewish home with three siblings - two brothers and a sister - and his two parents.  Zber's mother, Hina, was a homemaker who focused on raising her children.  They owned a small local grocery store, which was the source of their income.  Wolf, Zber's father, was known to be a man of integrity and he was elected ''parnas'' (religious and civic leader) for the community of P\u0142ock.\n\nZber's childhood was spent at the village Jewish elementary school and at ''Heder'' (school). During his time at ''Heder'', Zber learned religious studies and he became more attuned to his Jewish identity. His creative talents surfaced as a young boy while he was in elementary school, where he enjoyed drawing in pencil and crayon.  In school, Zber's first sculptural exhibit was a Greek head that he sculpted from a picture. Zber's teacher was the first to discover his artistic brilliance and the school principal, who was an artist herself, encouraged him to hone his natural talent and make an effort to continue in the artistic field.  At school painting competitions, Zber was rewarded with the first prize, and his displays received much praise.\n\nAt the age of 16, Zber moved to Warsaw with the intention of actively pursuing his artistic career. This was made possible by the financial support Zber received from the Jewish intellectuals in his hometown who believed in his artistic endeavors. There, as a way of earning income, Zber worked during the day at a picture postcard factory, and took private drawing lessons during his free time at night. This period of his life lasted for five years as preparation for attending the Warsaw Academy of Arts, where he was finally admitted in 1930. Zber studied drawing, painting and the techniques of printed graphic art. During this period of study, Zber discovered his love for wood engraving, and he entered the graphic arts studio under Wladyslaw Skoczylas. Skoczylas was a Polish artist born in Warsaw, who won the bronze medal for his series of artwork in the [[Olympic Games]] art competitions.\n\n==Career==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zber with his peers.jpg|thumb|Striking eyes, brilliant artist - leaning on the chair, Zber, at the Warsaw Academy of Arts<ref name=\"Zber at the Warsaw Academy of Arts\"/>]] -->\nZber's professional career beyond his studies began in 1936, at the age of 27, where his art was first exhibited at the \u2018Black and White\u2019 exhibition displayed in the \u2018Zachenta\u2019 Polish Artists\u2019 Gallery in [[Warsaw]]. Twenty-two of the exhibits in this exhibition were Zber's pieces. The public's response to his work was tremendous and the Polish government awarded him an eight-month scholarship to study in Paris. In the same year, Zber created his own portfolio of artwork and presented himself to the well-known Jewish art critic, Chil Aronson. The critic was impressed with Zber's work and gave him much praise as a xylography prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. Despite the difficult conditions in Paris, Zber continued living there, working for French journals. A year after his debut in Warsaw, Zber displayed his engravings of Jewish figures from his hometown, P\u0142ock, at the Paris World's Fair in 1937. From that year on, his work was regularly displayed around Paris, in salons and large annual art exhibitions. He was praised by high-ranking Parisian critics, and graphic arts experts wrote admiringly of him as a masterly young artist with a genius for wood engraving.\n\nThe extent to which Zber embraced [[Paris]] as his new home is evident through the artwork that emerged from this period of his life. He was deeply inspired by the scenes and environments he was exposed to. In 1938, after coming into contact with the enlightened Jewry of the Baltic countries, thirty-five of his pieces were exhibited in an exhibition entitled \u2018Jewish Graphic Art\u2019. The exhibition was received by the principal towns of all the Baltic countries as well as Eastern Europe. The last exhibition of his career was the display of his prints by the publishing firm of the Rue des Beaux Arts, followed by having his work published in a limited edition album, submitted to the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]].\n\n==Holocaust==\n[[File:Zber painting.jpg|thumb|Street scene at Beaune-la-Rolande - 1941<ref>{{cite web|title=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|website=File:Zber painting.jpg}}</ref>]]\n\nZber's successful but short career was to put to a halt in 1940 when [[Nazi Germany]] overtook Paris. Zber fled Paris in late May 1940 with a group of about ten Polish friends including his fellow artists and art school friends [[Ilya Schor]] and [[Resia Schor]] but then decided to return to be with Stenia Bonder. Of that group, only the Schors survived the [[Shoah]]. Zber married Stenia Bonder, who fought in the anti-Nazi underground movement in France. On May 14, 1941, Zber was arrested and sent, with 5,000 other Jews, to the French internment concentration camp of Beaune-La-Rolande.

He continued his piano studies in Cambridge while studying art history at [[Harvard University]]. He became interested in the harpsichord at Harvard and gave his first harpsichord recital there in 1930. After graduating in 1931, he traveled to Europe on a John Knowles Paine Fellowship. He studied with [[Nadia Boulanger]] and harpsichord revival pioneer [[Wanda Landowska]] in Paris, with [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] in [[Haslemere]], [[Heinz Tiessen]] in [[Berlin]], and [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in [[Leipzig]]. In January 1933 he made his European debut in Berlin performing [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Goldberg Variations]]''. In the summers of 1933 and 1934 he taught at the [[Mozarteum]] in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]]. A Guggenheim Fellowship awarded in 1936 enabled him to study seventeenth- and eighteenth-century manuscripts and sources in Europe. In 1938 he inaugurated a festival of Baroque music at the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg, Virginia and continued as adviser and principal performer for a number of years. \n\nIn 1938, G.

He continued his piano studies in Cambridge while studying art history at [[Harvard University]]. He became interested in the harpsichord at Harvard and gave his first harpsichord recital there in 1930. After graduating in 1931, he traveled to Europe on a John Knowles Paine Fellowship. He studied with [[Nadia Boulanger]] and harpsichord revival pioneer [[Wanda Landowska]] in Paris, with [[Arnold Dolmetsch]] in [[Haslemere]], [[Heinz Tiessen]] in [[Berlin]], and [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in [[Leipzig]]. In January 1933 he made his European debut in Berlin performing Bach's ''Goldberg Variations''. In the summers of 1933 and 1934 he taught at the [[Mozarteum]] in [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]]. A Guggenheim Fellowship awarded in 1936 enabled him to study seventeenth- and eighteenth-century manuscripts and sources in Europe. In 1938 he inaugurated a festival of Baroque music at the Governor's Palace in Williamsburg, Virginia and continued as adviser and principal performer for a number of years. \n\nIn 1938, G. Schirmer, NY. published his edition of Bach's ''[[Goldberg Variations]]''  which includes extensive discussion of ornamentation, fingering, [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], tempo, dynamics, and general interpretation.\n\nFrom 1940-1976 he was a professor at [[Yale University]].  He published his biography of [[Domenico Scarlatti]] and a critical edition of 60 sonatas by Scarlatti in 1953.

Directed by [[Chris Sanders]], in his live-action directorial debut, the film was written by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Dan Stevens]], [[Omar Sy]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Bradley Whitford]], and [[Colin Woodell]]. Set during the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]], the film follows a dog named Buck as he is stolen from his home in California and sent to the Yukon, where he befriends an old man and begins a life-altering adventure.\n\n''The Call of the Wild'' was released in the United States on February 21, 2020, by [[20th Century Studios]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the \"entertaining action and earnest tone\" but criticized the \"uncanny\" CGI of the animals.<ref name=WrapProj/> The film was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], having grossed $107 million against a production budget of $125\u2013150 million, and is projected to lose the studio $50\u2013100 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the late 19th century Gold Rush, Buck, a large, gentle [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]/[[Scotch Collie]], lives contentedly with his master, Judge Miller in [[Santa Clara, California]]. One night, Buck is abducted and shipped to the [[Yukon]] aboard a freighter. During the voyage, a crew member ill-treats him. After arriving, Buck returns a dropped harmonica to a man named John Thornton, moments before being sold to Perrault and his assistant, Francoise. They use a dog sled to deliver mail across the Yukon. Perrault hopes to make the long trek to the mail depot before the deadline. Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a Husky named Spitz.\n\nThroughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Francoise and the other sled dogs, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions: a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it, then attacks Buck to assert his dominance. Buck pins him down, displacing Spitz as pack leader, who disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive to deposit the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feeling about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal, a corrupt wealthy man, buys the pack, working them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding.\n\nThe exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a bar, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs abandoned him. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold.\n\nIn the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and mortally shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal, pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton, dying, wants Buck to live for himself. He embraces him and reassures him with his final words: \"It's okay, boy. You're home.\"\n\nThe next morning, Buck returns to the wilderness. There, he mates and has offspring with the white wolf and becomes the pack leader, fully embracing the call of the wild.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as John Thornton\n* [[Omar Sy]] as Perrault\n* [[Dan Stevens]] as Hal\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as Mercedes\n* [[Bradley Whitford]] as Judge Miller\n* [[Colin Woodell]] as Charles\n* [[Cara Gee]] as Fran\u00e7oise\n* [[Scott MacDonald (actor)| Scott MacDonald]] as Dawson \n\nActor and stunt coordinator [[Terry Notary]] stood-in for the CGI creation of Buck, whose model was scanned after an adopted dog.\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[20th Century Fox]] was developing the film adaptation of the [[Jack London]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Call of the Wild]]'', set in [[the Yukon]] around 1890s about the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], which would be directed by [[Chris Sanders]] from the script by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and would be produced by [[Erwin Stoff]].<ref name=\"Oct2017D\">{{cite news |last1=D'Alessandro |first1=Anthony |title='Gambit' Starring Channing Tatum Will Open Valentine's Day 2019 |url=https://deadline.com/2017/10/channing-tatum-gambit-to-open-valentines-day-2019-release-1202187558/ |accessdate=July 17, 2018 |work=Deadline |date=October 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Casting ===\nIn July 2018, [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Dan Stevens]] were cast in the film, with Ford set to star as John Thornton, who goes on the hunt for gold.

Directed by [[Chris Sanders]], in his live-action directorial debut, the film was written by [[Michael Green (writer)|Michael Green]], and stars [[Harrison Ford]], [[Dan Stevens]], [[Omar Sy]], [[Karen Gillan]], [[Bradley Whitford]], and [[Colin Woodell]]. Set during the 1890s [[Klondike Gold Rush]], the film follows a dog named Buck as he is stolen from his home in California and sent to the Yukon, where he befriends an old man and begins a life-altering adventure.\n\n''The Call of the Wild'' was released in the United States on February 21, 2020, by [[20th Century Studios]]. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the \"entertaining action and earnest tone\" but criticized the \"uncanny\" CGI of the animals.<ref name=WrapProj/> The film was a [[box-office bomb|box office bomb]], having grossed $107 million against a production budget of $125\u2013150 million, and is projected to lose the studio $50\u2013100 million.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring the late 19th century Gold Rush, Buck, a large, gentle [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]]/[[Scotch Collie]], lives contentedly with his master, Judge Miller in [[Santa Clara, California]]. One night, Buck is abducted and shipped to the [[Yukon]] aboard a freighter. During the voyage, a crew member ill-treats him. After arriving, Buck returns a dropped harmonica to a man named John Thornton, moments before being sold to Perrault and his assistant, Francoise. They use a dog sled to deliver mail across the Yukon. Perrault hopes to make the long trek to the mail depot before the deadline. Buck is introduced to the other dogs, including the vicious pack leader, a Husky named Spitz.\n\nThroughout their travels, Buck gains the loyalty and trust of Francoise and the other sled dogs, antagonizing Spitz. Buck begins experiencing ancestral spiritual visions: a black wolf that acts as his guide throughout their travels. One night, Buck catches then releases a rabbit. Spitz kills it, then attacks Buck to assert his dominance. Buck pins him down, displacing Spitz as pack leader, who disappears into the wild. Perrault grudgingly makes Buck the lead when no other dog assumes the position. Buck's speed and strength allow the sled to arrive to deposit the mail on time. There, Thornton hands over a letter he has written to his former wife expressing his feeling about their dead son. When Perrault returns, he learns the mail route is being replaced by the telegraph, forcing him to sell the dogs. Hal, a corrupt wealthy man, buys the pack, working them to exhaustion carrying a heavy load in weather unsuitable for sledding.\n\nThe exhausted dogs stop to rest before Hal can force them to cross an unstable frozen lake. When Buck refuses to move, Hal threatens to shoot him. Thornton appears and rescues Buck while Hal forces the other sled dogs to cross the lake. Under Thornton's care, Buck recovers. Later, at a bar, Thornton is attacked by Hal, who reveals the dogs abandoned him. Witnessing the scene, Buck attacks Hal. Buck and Thornton then travel beyond the Yukon map where they can freely live in the wild. They come across an abandoned cabin in an open valley and settle in. Meanwhile, Hal relentlessly hunts them, believing Thornton is hiding gold.\n\nIn the open wilderness, Thornton and Buck bond over their daily activities, primarily fishing and gold panning. Throughout their time together, Buck is drawn to a female white wolf. Going back and forth between Thornton and the white wolf, Buck is conflicted by his domesticated life with Thornton and his place with the wolf pack that the female belongs to. Thornton believes it is time to return home and tells Buck he is leaving in the morning, and to come and say good-bye. Buck heads into the forest and sleeps beside the white wolf, clearly conflicted. Hal subsequently finds and mortally shoots Thornton. Buck returns and kills Hal, pushing him into the cabin, which has caught on fire. Thornton, dying, wants Buck to live for himself.

FCK was founded in 1992 through the merger of [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub]] and [[Boldklubben 1903]].\n\nF.C. Copenhagen has won 13 [[List of Danish football champions|Danish Football Championships]] and 8 [[Danish Cup]]s. F.C. Copenhagen has reached the group stage of the [[UEFA Champions League]] and the group stage of the [[UEFA Europa League]] more times than any other Danish club and are the only Danish club who has reached the knockout stage of the Champions League.

Copenhagen 2017.jpg|333px|thumb|left]]\n\n===Early success===\nFootball Club Copenhagen is, in many ways, both an old and a new club. Even though the club was established in 1992, it is rooted in more than 100 years of club tradition. The club's first team represents two separate clubs: [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub]] (continental Europe's oldest football club) founded in 1876 and [[Boldklubben 1903]] founded in 1903. The two Copenhagen clubs merged their first teams to found Copenhagen on 1 July 1992. Copenhagen used Boldklubben's club license to play in the [[Danish Superliga]] championship, while [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub]] became the official reserve team of the club. With the rebuilding of the [[Parken Stadium]], Denmark's national team stadium, the new club had a modern stadium to play at from the beginning. The initial ambition of the club was continually to qualify for one of the European competitions each season. To reach this goal, the club needed a solid economy, a relatively big fan base and an \"attractive and positive style of football.\"<ref name=\"fck\">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/english/history/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514000826/http://www.fck.dk/english/history/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-05-14 |title=History |year=2006 |work=F.C.

He was rapidly attended to by club doctor Frank Odgaard who found that his heart had stopped beating and started to administer cardiac massage. Upon the ambulance's arrival, Solbakken was pronounced clinically dead at the scene, but on the way to the hospital in the ambulance he was revived nearly seven minutes later. He survived the episode and had a pacemaker fitted. Shortly after, on medical advice, he announced his playing retirement, but would later return to the club and become its most successful manager.\n\nCopenhagen faced Italian team [[S.S.

A 3\u20132 away win against [[FC Midtjylland]] saw them closing in on the second place. In the last round of the league, FCK beat [[Odense Boldklub]] 3\u20132 at home whilst Midtjylland lost their game 3\u20131, ensuring Copenhagen's seizure of second place and its subsequent spot in the qualifying round of the [[2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round|2014\u201315 Champions League]].\n\nAfter a busy summer transfer window with numerous new players arriving at the club, Copenhagen was drawn against Ukrainian outfit [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] in the third qualifying round of the 2014\u201315 Champions League.

Copenhagen's next two games were against Torino and Club Brugge respectively; it lost 1\u20130 against Torino and played to a 1\u20131 draw against Brugge after conceding a late goal in injury time in both matches. Copenhagen then failed to secure an important win against Brugge at home, a match they lost 0\u20134, setting up a must-win situation for FCK against HJK to progress to the round of 32. Copenhagen, however, failed\u2014[[Macoumba Kandji]] managed to secure a 2-1 victory for HJK, their second win in the group, with another late goal. The result eliminated Copenhagen.

By placing second in 2014\u201315, Copenhagen began in the second qualifying round of the [[2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League]], where they were drawn against Welsh club [[Newtown A.F.C.|Newtown]], defeating them 5\u20131 on aggregate to qualify them for the next round against Czech outfit [[FK Baumit Jablonec|Baumit Jablonec]]. The opening game of the [[2015\u201316 Danish Superliga]] ended in a 2\u20131 away win for FCK against [[Esbjerg fB]] through goals from [[Marvin Pouri\u00e9]] and [[Nicolai J\u00f8rgensen]]. Despite a 0\u20131 away win over Baumit Jablonec, Copenhagen lost its home game 2\u20133, resulting in a 3\u20133 aggregate loss on the [[away goals rule]]. This marked the first time in ten years that Copenhagen failed to qualify for either the Champions League or Europa League. On the 5th of May, the [[2015-16 Danish Cup|Danish Cup]] was won, after a 2\u20131 win Over AGF, with goals from [[Nicolai J\u00f8rgensen]] and [[William Kvist]].

The Sektion 12 area on the whole lower \"B-stand\" grew more and more popular which meant that the fans had a new dialogue with the club.

Copenhagen 2017.jpg|333px|thumb|left]]\n\n===Early success===\nFootball Club Copenhagen is, in many ways, both an old and a new club. Even though the club was established in 1992, it is rooted in more than 100 years of club tradition. The club's first team represents two separate clubs: [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub]] (continental Europe's oldest football club) founded in 1876 and [[Boldklubben 1903]] founded in 1903. The two Copenhagen clubs merged their first teams to found Copenhagen on 1 July 1992. Copenhagen used Boldklubben's club license to play in the [[Danish Superliga]] championship, while [[Kj\u00f8benhavns Boldklub]] became the official reserve team of the club. With the rebuilding of the [[Parken Stadium]], Denmark's national team stadium, the new club had a modern stadium to play at from the beginning. The initial ambition of the club was continually to qualify for one of the European competitions each season. To reach this goal, the club needed a solid economy, a relatively big fan base and an \"attractive and positive style of football.\"<ref name=\"fck\">{{cite web |url=http://fck.dk/english/history/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514000826/http://www.fck.dk/english/history/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-05-14 |title=History |year=2006 |work=F.C.

He was rapidly attended to by club doctor Frank Odgaard who found that his heart had stopped beating and started to administer cardiac massage. Upon the ambulance's arrival, Solbakken was pronounced clinically dead at the scene, but on the way to the hospital in the ambulance he was revived nearly seven minutes later. He survived the episode and had a pacemaker fitted. Shortly after, on medical advice, he announced his playing retirement, but would later return to the club and become its most successful manager.\n\nCopenhagen faced Italian team [[S.S.

A 3\u20132 away win against [[FC Midtjylland]] saw them closing in on the second place. In the last round of the league, FCK beat [[Odense Boldklub]] 3\u20132 at home whilst Midtjylland lost their game 3\u20131, ensuring Copenhagen's seizure of second place and its subsequent spot in the qualifying round of the [[2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League qualifying phase and play-off round|2014\u201315 Champions League]].\n\nAfter a busy summer transfer window with numerous new players arriving at the club, Copenhagen was drawn against Ukrainian outfit [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] in the third qualifying round of the 2014\u201315 Champions League.

Copenhagen's next two games were against Torino and Club Brugge respectively; it lost 1\u20130 against Torino and played to a 1\u20131 draw against Brugge after conceding a late goal in injury time in both matches. Copenhagen then failed to secure an important win against Brugge at home, a match they lost 0\u20134, setting up a must-win situation for FCK against HJK to progress to the round of 32. Copenhagen, however, failed\u2014[[Macoumba Kandji]] managed to secure a 2-1 victory for HJK, their second win in the group, with another late goal. The result eliminated Copenhagen.

Despite a 0\u20131 away win over Baumit Jablonec, Copenhagen lost its home game 2\u20133, resulting in a 3\u20133 aggregate loss on the [[away goals rule]]. This marked the first time in ten years that Copenhagen failed to qualify for either the Champions League or Europa League. On the 5th of May, the [[2015-16 Danish Cup|Danish Cup]] was won, after a 2\u20131 win Over AGF, with goals from [[Nicolai J\u00f8rgensen]] and [[William Kvist]].

The Sektion 12 area on the whole lower \"B-stand\" grew more and more popular which meant that the fans had a new dialogue with the club.
