The third element of the triple is often used to create an effect of surprise with the audience,<ref name=\"critiquecircle.com\"/> and is frequently the [[punch line]] of the joke itself. For instance, jokes might feature three stereotyped individuals\u2014such as [[an Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman]]; or a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead\u2014where the surprise or punch line of the joke comes from the third character.\n\nThe comedic rule of three is often paired with quick timing, ensuring that viewers have less time to catch on to the pattern before the punch line hits. As a whole, the comedic rule of threes relies on setting up a pattern of two items and then subverting viewer expectations by breaking that pattern with the third item. One particularly notable example comes from ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' - \"Can I get you anything? Cup of coffee? Doughnut? Toupee?\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTriple|title=The Triple|website=TV Tropes|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\nJust like most comedic writing, the rule of threes in comedy relies on building tension to a comedic release. In the case of the rule of threes, tension is built with the first two items in the pattern and then released with the final item, which should be the funniest of the three. Most triples are short in length, often only two or three sentences, but the rule can also be implemented effectively at longer length as long as base formula is still followed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/there-are-no-rules/comedy-writing-secrets-triples|title=Comedy Writing Secrets: Triple the Funny|last=Henshey|first=Chelsea|date=2016-02-11|website=WritersDigest.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\n==Fairy tales==\nIn [[storytelling]], authors often create triplets or structures in three parts. In its simplest form, this is merely ''beginning, middle, and end'', from [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]. [[Syd Field]] wrote a popular handbook of [[screenwriting]], in which he touted the advantages of [[three-act structure]] over the more traditional [[Act (drama)|five-act structure]] used by [[William Shakespeare]] and many other famous playwrights.\n\n[[File:Franz J\u00fcttner Schneewittchen 4.jpg|thumb|[[Snow White]] receives three visits from her wicked stepmother.]]\n\n[[Vladimir Propp]], in his ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', concluded that any of the elements in a folktale could be negated twice so that it would repeat thrice.<ref>Propp, Vladimir. ''Morphology of the Folk Tale''. Austin: University of Texas Press, 1968, p. 74, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}</ref> This is common not only in the Russian tales he studied but throughout [[Folklore|folk tales]] and [[fairy tale]]s: most commonly, perhaps, in that the [[youngest son]] is usually the third, although fairy tales often display the rule of three in the most blatant form. A small sample of the latter includes:\n* [[Rumpelstiltskin]] spins thrice for the heroine and lets her guess his name thrice over a period of three days.\n* In ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'', the heroine receives three gifts while searching for her lost husband; when she finds where he is held prisoner, she must use them to thrice bribe her way to the hero (the first two times she was unable to tell her story because he lay in a drugged sleep).\n* In ''[[Brother and Sister]]'', Brother is transformed into a deer when he drinks from the third stream that their wicked stepmother enchanted, and when Sister is killed by the same stepmother, she visits her child's room thrice, being caught and restored the third time.\n* In ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', a woman says she will bear the king three marvelous children; when they reappear, their envious aunts attempt to kill them by sending them on three quests, after the three marvelous things of the title.\n* In ''[[The Silent Princess]]'', a prince breaks a peasant woman's pitcher thrice, and is cursed; when he finds the title princess, he must persuade her to speak thrice.\n* In ''[[The Love for Three Oranges (fairy tale)|The Love for Three Oranges]]'', the hero picks three magical oranges, and only with the third is he able to keep the woman who springs out of it.\n\n==Literature==\n* In [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', [[Jacob Marley|Marley]]'s Ghost tells [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] he will receive visits from three spirits: [[The Ghost of Christmas Past]], [[The Ghost of Christmas Present]], and finally [[The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]], to which Scrooge says, \"Spirit, I fear you most of all.\"\n* In the musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', [[Tevye]] must give his three eldest daughters away, one after another. Each match progressively challenges his faith, as represented by a monologue in which he argues with himself using the phrase \"on the other hand\" to play the [[devil's advocate]] and convince himself to side with his daughters. This is subverted with the youngest daughter who wishes to marry a [[Gentile]], for which Tevye concludes that \"No, there is no other hand.\"\n* In [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', [[Mark Antony]] starts his speech by using the rule of three: [[Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears]], to which the commoners start to listen.\n\n==Rhetoric and public speaking==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe use of a series of three elements is also a well-known feature of public oratory. Max Atkinson, in his book on oratory entitled ''Our Masters' Voices'',<ref>Atkinson, J. Maxwell. ''Our Masters' Voices: The Language and Body Language of Politics''. London: Methuen, 1984. {{ISBN|0-416-37690-8}}</ref> gives interesting examples of how public speakers use three-part phrases to generate what he calls 'claptraps', evoking audience applause.\n\n[[Martin Luther King Jr.]], the civil rights activist and preacher, was known for his uses of tripling and the rule of three throughout his many influential speeches. For example, the speech \"Non-Violence and Racial Justice\" contained a binary opposition made up of the rule of three: \"insult, injustice and exploitation\", followed a few lines later by \"justice, good will, and brotherhood\".<ref>{{Cite web|title =Nonviolence and Racial Justice |url = http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol4/6-Feb-1957_NonviolenceAndRacialJustice.pdf|website = www.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref>  Conversely, segregationist Alabama governor [[George Wallace]] inveighed: \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\" during his [[George Wallace's 1963 Inaugural Address|1963 inaugural address]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Inaugural Address (1963) The \"Segregation Now, Segregation Forever\" Speech |author=Governor George Wallace of Alabama |url = http://web.utk.edu/~mfitzge1/docs/374/wallace_seg63.pdf|website = web.utk.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref>\n\nThe appeal of the three-fold pattern is also illustrated by the transformation of [[Winston Churchill]]'s reference to \"[[blood, toil, tears and sweat]]\" (echoing [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) in popular recollection to \"blood, sweat and tears\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat|url = http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/92-blood-toil-tears-and-sweat|website = www.winstonchurchill.org|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Presentation Skills 3.

This has been reduced to the commonly heard triad \"nasty, brutish and short\".\n\nThe [[Welsh Triads]] and [[Triads of Ireland|Irish Triads]] suggest the use of threes was also a mnemonic device\u2014easy-to-learn verses that were pointers to other information also committed to memory by Druids.\n\n==Law==\nA common feature of legal documents which give property or grant rights as drafted by legal professionals perpetuates old English practice in which the rule of three echoes the intended Act by the varying restatement of the act in triplicate.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}} For example, in a Will or Trust instrument the phrase \"I give, devise and bequeath ...\"\n\nUsually (in court) a common example is quoted: \"tell us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.<ref>{{Cite web|title = N.D.R.Ct. 6.10 Courtroom Oaths|url = http://www.ndcourts.gov/court/rules/ndroc/rule6.10.htm|website = www.ndcourts.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref>{{Relevance inline|date=March 2017}}\n\n==See also ==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n{{Portal |Children's literature}}\n* [[Hendiatris]] (or ''tripartite motto'')\n* [[Rule of thirds]]; a similar concept applied to visual art\n* [[Tricolon]]\n* [[Three classic laws of thought#Aristotle|The Three Classic Laws of thought]]\n* [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel#Triads|Triads]]\n* [[Triple deity]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n[[Category:Recurrent elements in fairy tales]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2009}}\n{{Original research|date=December 2014}}\n}}\n{{About|one meaning of \"rule of three\", in writing|other meanings|Rule of three (disambiguation){{!}}Rule of three}}\n[[File:The3bears-30.jpg|right|thumb|The story of [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]] uses the rule of three extensively, with the protagonist examining three sets of three items in a house, finding only the third of each set to be satisfactory]]\n\nThe '''rule of three''' is a [[writing]] principle that suggests that a [[wiktionary:trio|trio]] of events or characters is more humorous, satisfying, or effective than other numbers.<ref>{{Cite web|title = How to Use the \"Rule of Three\" to Create Engaging Content - Copyblogger|url = http://www.copyblogger.com/rule-of-three/|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref> The audience of this form of text is also thereby more likely to remember the information conveyed because having three entities combines both brevity and rhythm with having the smallest amount of information to create a pattern.<ref>{{Cite web|title = What is the mysterious \u2018Rule of Three\u2019? {{!}} Copywriters of Distinction|url = http://rule-of-three.co.uk/what-is-the-rule-of-three-copywriting/|website = rule-of-three.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref><ref name=\"Jonathan crossfield\">{{Cite web|title = Writing: The power of three|url = http://www.jonathancrossfield.com/blog/2009/06/writing-the-power-of-three.html|website = www.jonathancrossfield.com|accessdate = 2015-06-05}}</ref> It makes the author or speaker appear knowledgeable while being both simple and catchy.\n\nSlogans, film titles and a variety of other things have been structured in threes, a tradition that grew out of oral storytelling.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.toastmasters.org/~/media/258B5612D2D547DBA5C95D1890972E70.ashx|title = Toastmasters, November 2013|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Toastmaster|last = |first = |page = 17}}</ref> Examples include the [[Three Little Pigs]], [[Three Billy Goats Gruff]], and the [[Three Musketeers]].

Austin: University of Texas Press, 1968, p. 74, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}</ref> This is common not only in the Russian tales he studied but throughout [[Folklore|folk tales]] and [[fairy tale]]s: most commonly, perhaps, in that the [[youngest son]] is usually the third, although fairy tales often display the rule of three in the most blatant form. A small sample of the latter includes:\n* [[Rumpelstiltskin]] spins thrice for the heroine and lets her guess his name thrice over a period of three days.\n* In ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'', the heroine receives three gifts while searching for her lost husband; when she finds where he is held prisoner, she must use them to thrice bribe her way to the hero (the first two times she was unable to tell her story because he lay in a drugged sleep).\n* In ''[[Brother and Sister]]'', Brother is transformed into a deer when he drinks from the third stream that their wicked stepmother enchanted, and when Sister is killed by the same stepmother, she visits her child's room thrice, being caught and restored the third time.\n* In ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', a woman says she will bear the king three marvelous children; when they reappear, their envious aunts attempt to kill them by sending them on three quests, after the three marvelous things of the title.\n* In ''[[The Silent Princess]]'', a prince breaks a peasant woman's pitcher thrice, and is cursed; when he finds the title princess, he must persuade her to speak thrice.\n* In ''[[The Love for Three Oranges (fairy tale)|The Love for Three Oranges]]'', the hero picks three magical oranges, and only with the third is he able to keep the woman who springs out of it.\n\n==Literature==\n* In [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', [[Jacob Marley|Marley]]'s Ghost tells [[Ebenezer Scrooge]] he will receive visits from three spirits: [[The Ghost of Christmas Past]], [[The Ghost of Christmas Present]], and finally [[The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come]], to which Scrooge says, \"Spirit, I fear you most of all.\"\n* In the musical ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'', [[Tevye]] must give his three eldest daughters away, one after another. Each match progressively challenges his faith, as represented by a monologue in which he argues with himself using the phrase \"on the other hand\" to play the [[devil's advocate]] and convince himself to side with his daughters. This is subverted with the youngest daughter who wishes to marry a [[Gentile]], for which Tevye concludes that \"No, there is no other hand.\"\n* In [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'', [[Mark Antony]] starts his speech by using the rule of three: [[Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears]], to which the commoners start to listen.\n\n==Rhetoric and public speaking==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\n\nThe use of a series of three elements is also a well-known feature of public oratory. Max Atkinson, in his book on oratory entitled ''Our Masters' Voices'',<ref>Atkinson, J. Maxwell. ''Our Masters' Voices: The Language and Body Language of Politics''. London: Methuen, 1984. {{ISBN|0-416-37690-8}}</ref> gives interesting examples of how public speakers use three-part phrases to generate what he calls 'claptraps', evoking audience applause.\n\n[[Martin Luther King Jr.]], the civil rights activist and preacher, was known for his uses of tripling and the rule of three throughout his many influential speeches. For example, the speech \"Non-Violence and Racial Justice\" contained a binary opposition made up of the rule of three: \"insult, injustice and exploitation\", followed a few lines later by \"justice, good will, and brotherhood\".<ref>{{Cite web|title =Nonviolence and Racial Justice |url = http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/primarydocuments/Vol4/6-Feb-1957_NonviolenceAndRacialJustice.pdf|website = www.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref>  Conversely, segregationist Alabama governor [[George Wallace]] inveighed: \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\" during his [[George Wallace's 1963 Inaugural Address|1963 inaugural address]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Inaugural Address (1963) The \"Segregation Now, Segregation Forever\" Speech |author=Governor George Wallace of Alabama |url = http://web.utk.edu/~mfitzge1/docs/374/wallace_seg63.pdf|website = web.utk.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref>\n\nThe appeal of the three-fold pattern is also illustrated by the transformation of [[Winston Churchill]]'s reference to \"[[blood, toil, tears and sweat]]\" (echoing [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) in popular recollection to \"blood, sweat and tears\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat|url = http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/92-blood-toil-tears-and-sweat|website = www.winstonchurchill.org|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Presentation Skills 3.

This has been reduced to the commonly heard triad \"nasty, brutish and short\".\n\nThe [[Welsh Triads]] and [[Triads of Ireland|Irish Triads]] suggest the use of threes was also a mnemonic device\u2014easy-to-learn verses that were pointers to other information also committed to memory by Druids.\n\n==Law==\nA common feature of legal documents which give property or grant rights as drafted by legal professionals perpetuates old English practice in which the rule of three echoes the intended Act by the varying restatement of the act in triplicate.{{Citation needed|date = June 2015}} For example, in a Will or Trust instrument the phrase \"I give, devise and bequeath ...\"\n\nUsually (in court) a common example is quoted: \"tell us the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.<ref>{{Cite web|title = N.D.R.Ct. 6.10 Courtroom Oaths|url = http://www.ndcourts.gov/court/rules/ndroc/rule6.10.htm|website = www.ndcourts.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}</ref>{{Relevance inline|date=March 2017}}\n\n==See also ==<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n{{Portal |Children's literature}}\n* [[Hendiatris]] (or ''tripartite motto'')\n* [[Rule of thirds]]; a similar concept applied to visual art\n* [[Tricolon]]\n* [[Three classic laws of thought#Aristotle|The Three Classic Laws of thought]]\n* [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel#Triads|Triads]]\n* [[Triple deity]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n[[Category:Recurrent elements in fairy tales]]\n", "name_user": "186.138.15.62", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)"}

He is also known by his nickname, '''Gazza'''. He earned 57 [[cap (sport)|caps]] during his England career. The [[National Football Museum]] stated that he is \"widely recognised as the most naturally talented English footballer of his generation\".<ref name=\"nfm\" />\n\nBorn and raised in [[Gateshead]], Gascoigne signed schoolboy terms with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], before turning professional with the [[Football League First Division|top tier]] (pre-[[Premier League]] creation) club in 1985. Three years later he was sold on to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a \u00a32.2 million fee. He won the [[FA Cup]] with Spurs in [[1991 FA Cup Final|1991]], before being sold to Italian club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for \u00a35.5 million the following year. In July 1995, he was transferred to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] for \u00a34.3 million, and helped the club to two league titles and two trophies. He returned to England in a \u00a33.4 million move to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in March 1998. He made his debut in the Premier League in the 1998\u201399 season, having already featured in the [[1998 Football League Cup Final]]. He switched to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in July 2000, and later had spells with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Gansu Tianma F.C.|Gansu Tianma]] (China), and [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]].\n\nGascoigne was part of the England team that reached fourth place in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], where he famously [[crying|cried]] after receiving a yellow card in the [[West Germany v England (1990 FIFA World Cup)|semi-final with West Germany]] which meant he would have been suspended for the final had England won the game. He also helped the team to the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996]], which included scoring a goal against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2013 as \"one of the most iconic goals in the game's recent history\".<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/13/vault-paul-gascoigne-wondergoal-scotland-euro-96 | title= From the Vault: Paul Gascoigne's wondergoal against Scotland at Euro 96| first=Paul| last=Campbell| work=[[The Guardian]] | date=13 August 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> He has been involved in a number of high-profile [[goal celebration]]s at both club and international level, including the \"dentist's chair\" celebration from Euro '96, and mimicking playing a flute with Rangers in 1998.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football's best and worst goal celebrations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/6250946/Football-goal-celebrations-best-and-worst.html |accessdate=10 October 2018 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nIn the later parts of his career and especially following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by severe mental and emotional problems, particularly [[alcoholism]]. He has been jailed or [[involuntary commitment|sectioned]] on numerous occasions and his personal struggles receive regular coverage in the British press. He has frequently attempted to live without alcohol, though rehabilitation programmes have provided only temporary relief. His personal issues ended his coaching career, and he has not worked in football since being dismissed as the manager of [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]] in 2005.\n\n==Early life==\nGascoigne was born in [[Gateshead]], County Durham, on 27 May 1967.<ref>{{Hugman|7083|accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"newcastle\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HeroesDetail/0,,10278~550714,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424061003/http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HeroesDetail/0,,10278~550714,00.html |archivedate=24 April 2008 |title=Heroes: Paul Gascoigne |publisher=Newcastle United F.C}}</ref> His father, John (1946\u20132018), was a [[Brick hod|hod carrier]], and his mother, Carol, worked in a factory.<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=12}}</ref> He was named Paul John Gascoigne in tribute to [[Paul McCartney]] and [[John Lennon]] of [[the Beatles]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=13}}</ref>\n\nHe attended [[Breckenbeds Junior High School]], then the [[Heathfield Senior High School]], both in the [[Low Fell]] area of Gateshead.<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=23}}</ref> He was noticed by football scouts while playing for Gateshead Boys, though failed to impress in a trial at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=30}}</ref> Further trials at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] also proved unsuccessful, before the team he supported, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], signed him as a schoolboy in 1980.<ref name=\"Gascoigne 2004 31\">{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=31}}</ref> Gascoigne frequently got into trouble with his friend Jimmy \"Five Bellies\" Gardner.

He is also known by his nickname, '''Gazza'''. He earned 57 [[cap (sport)|caps]] during his England career. The [[National Football Museum]] stated that he is \"widely recognised as the most naturally talented English footballer of his generation\".<ref name=\"nfm\" />\n\nBorn and raised in [[Gateshead]], Gascoigne signed schoolboy terms with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], before turning professional with the [[Football League First Division|top tier]] (pre-[[Premier League]] creation) club in 1985. Three years later he was sold on to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a \u00a32.2 million fee. He won the [[FA Cup]] with Spurs in [[1991 FA Cup Final|1991]], before being sold to Italian club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for \u00a35.5 million the following year. In July 1995, he was transferred to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] for \u00a34.3 million, and helped the club to two league titles and two trophies. He returned to England in a \u00a33.4 million move to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in March 1998. He made his debut in the Premier League in the 1998\u201399 season, having already featured in the [[1998 Football League Cup Final]]. He switched to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in July 2000, and later had spells with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Gansu Tianma F.C.|Gansu Tianma]] (China), and [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]].\n\nGascoigne was part of the England team that reached fourth place in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], where he famously [[crying|cried]] after receiving a yellow card in the [[West Germany v England (1990 FIFA World Cup)|semi-final with West Germany]] which meant he would have been suspended for the final had England won the game. He also helped the team to the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996]], which included scoring a goal against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2013 as \"one of the most iconic goals in the game's recent history\".<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/13/vault-paul-gascoigne-wondergoal-scotland-euro-96 | title= From the Vault: Paul Gascoigne's wondergoal against Scotland at Euro 96| first=Paul| last=Campbell| work=[[The Guardian]] | date=13 August 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> He has been involved in a number of high-profile [[goal celebration]]s at both club and international level, including the \"dentist's chair\" celebration from Euro '96, and mimicking playing a flute with Rangers in 1998.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football's best and worst goal celebrations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/6250946/Football-goal-celebrations-best-and-worst.html |accessdate=10 October 2018 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nIn the later parts of his career and especially following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by severe mental and emotional problems, particularly [[alcoholism]].

In this way, toxins are [[biomagnification|concentrated upward]] within ocean [[food chain]]s. Many particles combine chemically in a manner which depletes oxygen, causing [[estuary|estuaries]] to become [[hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]]. [[Pesticide]]s and [[toxic metal]]s are similarly incorporated into marine food webs, harming the biological health of marine life. Many [[compound feed|animal feeds]] have a high [[fish meal]] or [[fish hydrolysate]] content. In this way, marine toxins are transferred back to farmed land animals, and then to humans.\n\n[[Phytoplankton]] concentrations have increased over the last century in coastal waters, and more recently have declined in the open ocean. Increases in nutrient runoff from land may explain the increases in coastal phytoplankton, while warming surface temperatures in the open ocean may have strengthened stratification in the water column, reducing the flow of nutrients from the deep that open ocean phytoplankton find useful.<ref>Boyce, D.G. and [[Boris Worm|Worm, B.]] (2015) \"Patterns and ecological implications of historical marine phytoplankton change\".

In this way, toxins are [[biomagnification|concentrated upward]] within ocean [[food chain]]s. Many particles combine chemically in a manner which depletes oxygen, causing [[estuary|estuaries]] to become [[hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]]. [[Pesticide]]s and [[toxic metal]]s are similarly incorporated into marine food webs, harming the biological health of marine life. Many [[compound feed|animal feeds]] have a high [[fish meal]] or [[fish hydrolysate]] content. In this way, marine toxins are transferred back to farmed land animals, and then to humans.\n\n[[Phytoplankton]] concentrations have increased over the last century in coastal waters, and more recently have declined in the open ocean. Increases in nutrient runoff from land may explain the increases in coastal phytoplankton, while warming surface temperatures in the open ocean may have strengthened stratification in the water column, reducing the flow of nutrients from the deep that open ocean phytoplankton find useful.<ref>Boyce, D.G. and [[Boris Worm|Worm, B.]] (2015) \"Patterns and ecological implications of historical marine phytoplankton change\".
