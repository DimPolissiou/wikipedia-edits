Following the death of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] king [[Ram Khamhaeng]], and internal disputes within the [[kingdom of Lanna]], both ''Vieng Chan Vieng Kham'' ([[Vientiane]]) and ''Xieng Dong Xieng Thong'' ([[Luang Prabang]]) were independent city-states until the founding of the [[kingdom of Lan Xang]] in 1354.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/plape/citiesaut11/readings/Fletcher-water%20management%20in%20angkor%20Antiquity%202008.pdf   |title= A Short History of South East Asia Chapter 3.

The ''Nithan Khun Borom'' or \"Story of [[Khun Borom]]\" recalls the origin myths of the [[Lao people|Lao]], and follows the exploits of his seven sons to found the [[Tai peoples|Tai]] kingdoms of Southeast Asia.  The myths also recorded the laws of Khun Borom, which set the basis of common law and identity among the Lao.  Among the [[Khamu]] the exploits of their folk hero Thao Hung are recounted in the ''Thao Hung Thao Cheuang'' epic, which dramatizes the struggles of the indigenous peoples with the influx of Tai during the migration period.  In later centuries the Lao themselves would preserve the legend in written form, becoming one of the great literary treasures of Laos and one of the few depictions of life in Southeast Asia prior to Therevada Buddhism and Tai cultural influence.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n==Lan Xang (1353\u20131707)==\n{{main|Lan Xang}}\n[[File:Southeast Asian history - Around 1540.png|thumb|right|Lan Xang's zone of influence and neighbours, c. 1540]]\n[[Lan Xang]] (1353\u20131707) was one of the largest kingdoms in [[Southeast Asia]]. Also known as the \"Land of a million elephants under the white parasol\" the kingdom's name alludes to the power of the kingship and formidable war machine of the early kingdom. The founding of Lan Xang was recorded in 1353, after a series of conquests by [[Fa Ngum]].  From 1353\u20131560 the capital of Lan Xang was [[Luang Prabang]] (known alternately as ''Muang Sua'' and ''Xieng Dong Xieng Thong''). Under successive kings the kingdom expanded its sphere of influence over an area that now incorporates all of modern [[Laos]], the [[Sip Song Chau Tai|Sipsong Chu Tai]] of [[Vietnam]], [[Sipsong Panna]] of Southern [[China]], [[Khorat Plateau]] region of [[Thailand]], and the [[Stung Treng]] region of Northern [[Cambodia]].\n\nLan Xang existed as a sovereign kingdom for over 350 years. The first serious foreign invasion came from the [[Dai Viet]] in 1479, which was defeated, though leaving the capital of [[Luang Prabang]] largely destroyed. The first half of the sixteenth century allowed for the power, prestige and cultural influence of the kingdom to be restored under a series of strong kings (see Souvanna Balang, [[Visunarat|Vixun]], [[Photisarath]]). In the 1540s a series of succession disputes in the neighboring [[Kingdom of Lanna]], created a regional rivalry between [[Burma]], [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] and Lan Xang. In 1540 Lan Xang defeated an incursion from [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]]. By 1545 the [[Kingdom of Lanna]] was attacked by the [[Burma|Burmese]] and then [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]]. Lan Xang entered into an alliance with [[Lanna Kingdom|Lanna]], and aided in the defense of the kingdom. In 1547 the kingdoms of Lan Xang and [[Lanna Kingdom|Lanna]] were briefly unified under [[Photisarath]] of Lan Xang and his son [[Setthathirath]] in [[Lanna Kingdom|Lanna]]. [[Setthathirath]] would go on to become the king of Lan Xang on the death of his father, and become one of the greatest kings of Lan Xang.\n\nThe [[Burma|Burmese]] [[Toungoo Dynasty]] began a series of expansions during the late 1550s which culminated under King [[Bayinnaung]]. [[Setthathirath]] moved the capital of Lan Xang from [[Luang Prabang]] to [[Vientiane]] in 1560, to better defend against the threat of [[Burma]] and to more ably administer the central and southern provinces. [[Bayinnaung]] subjugated the [[Kingdom of Lanna]] and went on to destroy the kingdom and city of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] in 1564.  King [[Setthathirath]] fought two successful guerilla campaigns against the [[Burma|Burmese]] invasions, leaving Lan Xang the only independent [[Tai peoples|Tai]] kingdom until his death in 1572, while on campaign against the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]]. The [[Burma|Burmese]] succeeded with the third invasion of Lan Xang around 1573, and Lan Xang became a vassal state until 1591 when the son of [[Setthathirath]], Nokeo Koumane, was able to successfully reassert independence.\n\nLan Xang recovered and reached the apex of its political and economic power during the seventeenth century under King [[Sourigna Vongsa]], who became the longest reigning of Lan Xang's monarchs (1637\u20131694).  In the 1640s the first European explorers to leave a detailed account of the kingdom arrived looking to establish trade and secure Christian converts, both were ultimately largely unsuccessful. Upon the death of [[Sourigna Vongsa]] a succession dispute erupted and the kingdom of Lan Xang was ultimately divided into constituent kingdoms in 1707.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n==Regional Kingdoms (1707\u20131779)==\n{{main|Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Kingdom of Vientiane|Kingdom of Champasak}}\n[[File:Laos - Division territ\u00f2riala v\u00e8rs 1750 (vuege).png|thumb|right|Southeast Asia around 1707 until 1828 showing the kingdoms of Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Champasak and the principality of Phuan (Xieng Khuang)]]\nBeginning in 1707 the [[Lao people|Lao]] kingdom of [[Lan Xang]] was partitioned into regional kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] and later [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] (1713).  The [[Kingdom of Vientiane]] was the strongest of the three, with [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]] extending influence across the [[Khorat Plateau]] (now part of modern [[Thailand]]) and conflicting with the [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang]] for control of the [[Xieng Khouang Province|Xieng Khouang Plateau]] (on the border of modern [[Vietnam]]).\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang]] was the first of the regional kingdoms to emerge in 1707, when King Xai Ong Hue of [[Lan Xang]] was challenged by Kingkitsarat, the grandson of [[Sourigna Vongsa]].  Xai Ong Hue and his family had sought asylum in [[Vietnam]] when they were exiled during the reign of [[Sourigna Vongsa]].  Xai Ong Hue gained the support of the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] Emperor [[L\u00ea Hy T\u00f4ng|Le Duy Hiep]] in exchange for recognition of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] suzerainty over [[Lan Xang]]. At the head of a [[Vietnam]]ese army Xai Ong Hue attacked [[Vientiane]] and executed King Nantharat another claimant to the throne.  In response [[Sourigna Vongsa]]\u2019s grandson Kingkitsarat rebelled and moved with his own army from the [[Sipsong Panna]] toward [[Luang Prabang]].  Kingkitsarat then moved south to challenge Xai Ong Hue in [[Vientiane]].  Xai Ong Hue then turned toward the [[Kingdom of Ayutthaya]] for support, and an army was dispatched which rather than supporting Xai Ong Hue arbitrated the division between [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] and [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]].\n\nIn 1713, the southern [[Lao people|Lao]] nobility continued the rebellion against Xai Ong Hue under [[Nokasad]], a nephew of [[Sourigna Vongsa]], and the [[Kingdom of Champasak]] emerged.  The [[Kingdom of Champasak]] comprised the area south of the [[Xe Bang Fai River|Xe Bang River]] as far as [[Stung Treng Province|Stung Treng]] together with the areas of the lower [[Mun River|Mun]] and [[Chi River|Chi]] rivers on the [[Khorat Plateau]].  Although less populous than either [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] or [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] occupied an important position for regional power and international trade via the [[Mekong River]].\n\nThroughout the 1760s and 1770s the kingdoms of [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] and [[Burma]] competed against each other in a bitter armed rivalry, and sought out alliances with the [[Lao people|Lao]] kingdoms to strengthen their relative positions by adding to their own forces and denying them to their enemy. As a result, the use of competing alliances would further militarize the conflict between the northerly [[Lao people|Lao]] kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] and [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]].  Between the two major [[Lao people|Lao]] kingdoms if an alliance with one was sought by either [[Burma]] or [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]], the other would tend to support the remaining side.  The network of alliances shifted with the political and military landscape throughout the latter half of the eighteenth century.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n==Siam and Suzerainty (1779\u20131893)==\n{{main|Thonburi Kingdom|Rattanakosin Kingdom}}\nBy 1779 General [[Taksin]] had driven the [[Toungoo Dynasty|Burmese]] from [[Siam]], had overrun the [[Lao people|Lao]] Kingdoms of [[Champasak Kingdom|Champasak]] and [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], and forced [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] to accept vassalage ([[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] had aided [[Siam]] during the siege of [[Vientiane]]).  Traditional power relationships in [[Southeast Asia]] followed the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala]] model, warfare was waged to secure population centers for [[corvee labor]], control regional trade, and confirm religious and secular authority by controlling potent [[Buddhist]] symbols ([[White elephant (animal)|white elephants]], important [[stupa]]s, temples, and [[Buddha]] images).  To legitimize the [[Thonburi Dynasty]], General [[Taksin]] seized the [[Emerald Buddha]] and [[Phra Bang]] images from [[Vientiane]]. [[Taksin]] also demanded that the ruling elites of the [[Lao people|Lao]] kingdoms and their royal families pledge [[vassalage]] to [[Siam]] in order to retain their regional autonomy in accordance with the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala]] model. In the traditional [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala]] model, vassal kings retained their power to raise tax, discipline their own vassals, inflict capital punishment, and appoint their own officials.  Only matters of war, and succession required approval from the [[suzerain]].  Vassals were also expected to provide annual tribute of gold and silver (traditionally modeled into trees), provide tax and tax in-kind, raise support armies in time of war, and provide [[corvee labor]] for state projects.\n[[File:Emerald Buddha.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Emerald Buddha]]]]\nHowever, by 1782 [[Taksin]] had been deposed and [[Rama I]] was king of [[Siam]], and began a series of reforms which fundamentally altered the traditional [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala]].  Many of the reforms took place to more closely administer and assimilate the [[Khorat Plateau]](or [[Isan]]) which was traditionally and culturally part of the Lao kingdoms\u2019 tributary networks.  In 1778, only [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] was a tributary of Siam, yet by the end of the reign of Rama I [[Sisaket (town)|Sisaket]], [[Ubon]], [[Roi Et]], [[Yasothon]], [[Khonkhaen|Khon Khaen]], and [[Kalasin]] paid tribute directly to [[Bangkok]].  According to [[Thai people|Thai]] records, by 1826 (less than fifty years) the number of towns and cities in [[Isan]] had grown from 13 to 35.  Forced population transfers from Lao areas were further reinforced by [[corvee labor]] projects and increased taxes.  Siam required labor to help rebuild from repeated Burmese invasions, and growing sea trade.  Increasing the productivity and population living on the [[Khorat Plateau]] provided the labor and material access to strengthen Siam.\n\nSiribunnyasan the last independent king of [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]] had died by 1780, and his sons Nanthasen, Inthavong, and [[Anouvong]] had been taken to [[Bangkok]] as prisoners during the sack of [[Vientiane]] in 1779.  The sons would become successive kings of [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]] (under Siamese suzerainty), beginning with Nanthasen in 1781.  Nanthasen was allowed to return to [[Vientiane]] with the [[Phra Bang]], the [[Palladium (protective image)|palladium]] of [[Lan Xang]], the [[Emerald Buddha]] remained in [[Bangkok]] and became an important symbol to the [[Lao people|Lao]] of their captivity.  One of Nanthasen's first acts was to seize Chao Somphu a [[Phuane|Phuan]] prince from [[Xieng Khouang province|Xieng Khouang]] who had entered into a tributary relationship with [[Vietnam]], and released him only when it was agreed that [[Xieng Khouang province|Xieng Khouang]] would also acknowledge Vientiane as suzerain.  In 1791, Anuruttha was confirmed by [[Rama I]] as king of [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]].  By 1792 Nanthasen had convinced [[Rama I]] that Anuruttha was secretly dealing with the [[Burma|Burmese]], and Siam allowed Nanthasen to lead an army and besiege and capture [[Luang Prabang]].  Anuruttha was sent to [[Bangkok]] as a prisoner, and only through diplomatic exchanges facilitated by [[China]], was Anuruttha released in 1795.  Soon after Anuruttha's release it was alleged that Nanthasen had been plotting with the governor of [[Nakhon Phanom]] to rebel against Siam. [[Rama I]] ordered the immediate arrest of Nanthasen, and soon after he died in captivity.  Inthavong (1795\u20131804) became the next king of [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], and dispatched armies to aide Siam against Burmese invasions in 1797 and 1802, and to capture the [[Sipsongchuthai|Sipsong Chau Tai]] (with his brother Anouvong as general).<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n===Anouvong\u2019s Rebellion and Lao Nationalism===\n{{main|Chao Anu Rebellion}}\n[[File:Chao Anouvong.jpg|thumbnail|right|180px|King [[Anouvong]], [[Kingdom of Vientiane]]]]\n[[Anouvong]] is a symbolic and controversial figure even today, his short lived rebellion against Siam from [[Anouvong's rebellion|1826\u20131829]] ultimately proved futile and led to the total annihilation of [[Vientiane]] as a kingdom and a city, yet among the Lao he remains a potent symbol of unyielding defiance and national identity. [[Thai people|Thai]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] histories record that [[Anouvong]] rebelled as the result of personal insult suffered at the funeral of [[Rama II of Thailand|Rama II]] in [[Bangkok]].  Yet, the [[Anouvong's rebellion|Anouvong Rebellion]] lasted three years and engulfed the whole of the [[Khorat Plateau]] for more complex reasons.\n\nThe history of forced population transfers, [[corvee labor]] projects, loss of national symbols and prestige (most notably the [[Emerald Buddha]]) formed the backdrop to specific actions taken by [[Rama III]] to directly annex the [[Isan]] region.  In 1812 [[Siam]] and [[Vietnam]] were at odds over the succession of the [[Cambodia]]n king, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] gained the upper hand with their chosen successor and [[Siam]] compensated itself by annexing territory on the [[Dangrek Mountains]] and along the [[Mekong River]] in [[Stung Treng Province|Stung Treng]].  As a result, Lao international trade along the [[Mekong River|Mekong]] was effectively blockaded, and heavy duties were imposed on Lao merchants who were viewed suspiciously by [[Siam]] for their trade with both the [[Cambodian people|Cambodians]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]].\n\nIn 1819 a rebellion in [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] provided [[Anouvong]] with opportunity, and he dispatched an army under his son Nyo who managed to suppress the conflict.  In exchange [[Anouvong]] successfully made the case that his son be crowned as king in [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]], which was confirmed by [[Bangkok]]. [[Anouvong]] had successfully expanded his influence throughout [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], [[Isan]], [[Xieng Khouang province|Xieng Khouang]] and now [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]]. [[Anouvong]] dispatched a number of diplomatic missions to [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]], which were viewed suspiciously in light of his growing regional influence.\n\nBy 1825 [[Rama II of Thailand|Rama II]] had died, and [[Rama III]] was consolidating his position against prince [[Mongkut]] ([[Rama IV]]).  In the ensuing power struggle before the accession of [[Rama III]] one of [[Anouvong]]\u2019s grandsons was killed.  When [[Anouvong]] arrived for the funerary services, he made several requests of the king [[Rama III]] which were dismissed including the return of his sister who had been captured in 1779, and Lao families which had been relocated to [[Saraburi]] near [[Bangkok]].  Before returning to [[Vientiane]], [[Anouvong]]\u2019s son Ngau, the crown prince, was forced to perform manual labor during which he was beaten.\n\nEarly in his reign, [[Rama III]] ordered a census of all peoples on the [[Khorat Plateau]], the census involved the forced tattooing of each villager\u2019s census number and name of their village.  The aim of the policy was to more tightly administer Lao territories from [[Bangkok]] and was facilitated by the nobility [[Siam]] had installed in the newly created cities throughout the region.  Popular resentment against the forced tattooing and increased taxes became ''[[casus belli]]'' for rebellion.\n\nToward the end of 1826 [[Anouvong]] was making military preparations for armed rebellion. [[Anouvong]]\u2019s strategy involved three objectives, first was to repatriate all ethnic [[Lao people|Lao]] living in [[Siam]] to the right bank of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]] and execute any Siamese engaged in the tattooing of [[Lao people|Lao]], the second objective was to consolidate [[Lao people|Lao]] power by forging an alliance with [[Chiang Mai]] and [[Luang Prabang]], the third and final goal was to gain international support from either the [[Vietnam]]ese, [[China|Chinese]], [[Burma|Burmese]] or [[British Empire|British]].  In January hostilities commenced, and the Lao armies were sent from [[Vientiane]] to capture [[Nakhon Ratchasima]], [[Kalasin]], and Lomsak.  From [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] forces rushed to take [[Ubon]] and Suvannaphum, while pursuing a [[scorched-earth]] policy ensuring the [[Lao people|Lao]] time to retreat.\n\n[[Anouvong]]\u2019s forces pushed south eventually to [[Saraburi]] to free the [[Lao people|Lao]] there, but the flood of refugees pushing north slowed the armies\u2019 retreat. [[Anouvong]] also severely underestimated the [[Siam]]ese arms stockpile, which under the terms of [[Burney Treaty]] had provided [[Siam]] with weaponry from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in [[Europe]].  A [[Lao people|Lao]] defense was staged at [[Nong Bua Lamphu]] the traditional Lao stronghold in the [[Isan]], but the [[Siam]]ese emerged victorious and leveled the city.  The [[Siam]]ese pushed north to take [[Vientiane]] and [[Anouvong]] fled southeast to the border with [[Vietnam]]. By 1828 [[Anouvong]] had been captured, tortured and sent to [[Bangkok]] with his family to die in a cage. [[Rama III]] ordered [[Bodindecha|Chao Bodin]] to return and level the city of [[Vientiane]], and forcibly move the entire population of the former Lao capital to the [[Isan]] region.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n===Aftermath and Vietnamese Intervention===\nFollowing the [[Anouvong's rebellion|Anouvong Rebellion]] Siam and Vietnam were increasingly at odds over control of the [[Indochinese Peninsula]]. In 1831 [[Minh Mang|Emperor Minh Mang]] sent [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] troops to seize [[Xieng Khouang province|Xieng Khouang]] and annexed the area as the province of Tran Ninh. Also in 1831 and again in 1833 King Mantha Tourath sent a tributary mission to the [[Vietnam]]ese, which were quietly ignored so as not to antagonize the [[Siam]]ese further.  In 1893 these tributary missions from [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] were used by the [[French colonial empire|French]] as part of a legal argument for all the territories on the east bank of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]]. In late 1831 [[Siam]] and [[Vietnam]] had a series of wars ([[Siamese-Vietnamese War (1831-1834)|Siamese-Vietnamese War 1831\u20131834]], and [[Siamese-Vietnamese War (1841-1845)|Siamese-Vietnamese War 1841\u20131845]]) over control of [[Xieng Khouang province|Xieng Khouang]] and [[Cambodia]].\n\nIn the aftermath of [[Vientiane]]'s destruction the Siamese divided the [[Lao people|Lao]] lands into three administrative regions.  In the north, the king of [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] and a small Siamese garrison controlled [[Luang Prabang]], the [[Sipsong Panna]], and [[Sipsongchuthai|Sipsong Chao Tai]].  The central region was administered from [[Nong Khai]] and extended to the borders of Tran Ninh ([[Xieng Khouang province|Xieng Khouang]]) and south to [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]].  The southern regions were controlled from [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] and extended to areas bordering [[Cochin China]] and [[Cambodia]]. From the 1830s through the 1860s small rebellions took place across [[Lao people|Lao]] lands and the [[Khorat Plateau]], but they lacked both the scale and coordination of the [[Anouvong's rebellion|Anouvong Rebellion]]. Importantly, at the end of each rebellion Siamese troops would return to their administrative centers, and no Lao region was allowed to have a buildup of force which could have been used in rebellion.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n===Population Transfers and Slavery===\n[[File:Ruins in Vientiane, depicted by Louis Delaporte (c.1867).jpg|thumbnail|right|Ruins in Vientiane, depicted by Louis Delaporte during the Mekong Expedition led by Francis Garnier (c. 1867).]]\nPopulation transfers of ethnic [[Lao people|Lao]] to [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] began in 1779 with [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] suzerainty. Artisans and members of the court were forcibly moved to [[Saraburi]] near [[Bangkok]], and several thousand farmers and peasant who were transported throughout [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] to [[Phetchaburi]], [[Ratchaburi]], and Nakhon Chaisi in the southwest and to [[Prachinburi]] and [[Chanthaburi]] in the southeast. However, massive deportations estimated between 100,000\u2013300,000 people began following the defeat of King [[Anouvong]] in 1828, and would continue until the 1870s. From 1828\u20131830 over 66,000 people were forcibly relocated from [[Vientiane]]. In 1834 the first of several relocations of the [[Phuan people|Phuan]] areas of [[Xieng Khouang Province|Xieng Khouang]] began, transferring more than 6,000 people. Most of those relocated were settled in the [[Isan]] region and were considered that ''cha loei'' or \u201cwar slaves\u201d who were to serve as [[serfs]] in underpopulated areas for the [[Thai people|Thai]] elite. The result changed the demographics and cultural traditions of [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]] and continues today with a five-fold disparity between the ethnic [[Lao people|Lao]] living on the West Bank of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]] and those left in the East in what is today [[Laos]].\n\nAlthough slavery existed in [[Lao people|Lao]] areas before the rebellion in 1828, the defeat and subsequent removal of most ethnic [[Lao people|Lao]] left a depopulated and vulnerable position for the remaining people of the East Bank of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]]. [[Lao Theung]] hill tribes which had little involvement in the 1828 rebellion bore the brunt of organized slave raids into [[Laos]] and became known collectively and pejoratively in [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]] as ''kha'' or \u201cslaves.\u201d [[Lao Theung]] were hunted or sold into slavery frequent organized raiding parties from [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]], [[Laos]] and [[China]]. Larger tribes of [[Lao Theung]], such as the [[Brao people|Brao]], would conduct slave raids against weaker tribes.  The raids continued throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century, a [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] military campaign in Laos in 1876 was described by a British observer as having been \"transformed into slave-hunting raids on a large scale.\"\n\nThe population transfers and slave raids ameliorated toward the end of the nineteenth century when European observers and anti-slavery groups made their presence increasingly difficult for the [[Bangkok]] elite. In 1880 both slave raiding and trading became illegal, although debt slavery would persist until 1905 by decree of King [[Chulalongkorn]].  The [[French Indochina|French]] would use the existence of slavery in [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] as one of the major professed motivations for establishing a [[French Protectorate of Laos|Protectorate of Laos]] during the 1880s and 1890s.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n[[File:Soldier Black-Flag.jpg|thumb|180px|right|A soldier of the Black Flag Army, 1885]]\n\n===The Haw Wars===\n{{main|Haw Wars}}\nIn the 1840s sporadic rebellions, slave raids, and movement of refugees throughout the areas that would become modern [[Laos]] left whole regions politically and militarily weak.  In [[China]] the [[Qing Dynasty]] was pushing south to incorporate hill peoples into the central administration, at first floods of refugees and later bands of rebels from the [[Taiping Rebellion]] pushed into [[Lao people|Lao]] lands.  The rebel groups became known by their banners and included the Yellow (or Striped) Flags, Red Flags and the Black Flags. The bandit groups rampaged throughout the countryside, with little response from [[Siam]].\n\nDuring the early and mid-nineteenth century the first [[Lao Sung]] including the [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Mien people|Mien]], [[Yao people|Yao]] and other [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] groups began settling in the higher elevations of [[Phongsali Province, Laos|Phongsali]] province and northeast [[Laos]].  The influx of immigration was facilitated by the same political weakness which had given shelter to the [[Black Flag Army|Haw]] bandits and left large depopulated areas throughout [[Laos]].\n\nBy the 1860s the first [[French people|French]] explorers were pushing north charting the path of the [[Mekong River]], with hope of a navigable waterway to southern [[China]]. Among the early [[French Indochina|French]] explorers was an expedition led by [[Francis Garnier]], who was killed during an expedition by [[Black Flag Army|Haw]] rebels in [[Tonkin]].  The [[French Indochina|French]] would increasingly conduct military campaigns against the Haw in both [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]] ([[Tonkin]]) until the 1880s.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n==Colonialism and the French Protectorate of Laos (1893\u20131953)==\n{{main|French Protectorate of Laos|First Indochina War|History of Laos since 1945}}\n[[File:AJMPavie.jpg|thumbnail|180px|left|[[Auguste Pavie]], First Governor-General of the [[French Protectorate of Laos]]]]\n\n=== Origins of French colonialism in Laos ===\n[[French people|French]] colonial interests in [[Laos]] began with the exploratory missions of [[Doudart De Lagree|Doudart de Lagree]] and [[Francis Garnier]] during the 1860s. France hoped to utilize the [[Mekong River]] as a route to southern [[China]].  Although the Mekong is unnavigable due to a number of rapids, the hope was that the river might be tamed with the help of French engineering and a combination of railways. In 1886 [[Great Britain|Britain]] secured the right to appoint a representative in [[Chiang Mai]], in northern [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]].  To counter [[British people|British]] control in [[Burma]] and growing influence in Siam, that same year [[France]] sought to establish representation in [[Luang Prabang]], and dispatched [[Auguste Pavie]] to secure [[French people|French]] interests.\n\nPavie and French auxiliaries arrived in [[Luang Prabang]] in 1887 in time to witness an attack on [[Luang Prabang]] by [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Tai peoples|Tai]] bandits who hoped to liberate the brothers of their leader [[\u0110\u00e8o V\u0103n Tr\u1ecb]], who were being held prisoner by the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]]. Pavie prevented the capture of the ailing King [[Oun Kham]] by ferrying him away from the burning city to safety.  The incident won the gratitude of the king, provided an opportunity for [[France]] to gain control of the [[Sipsongchuthai|Sipsong Chu Thai]] as part of [[Tonkin]] in [[French Indochina]], and demonstrated the weakness of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] in Laos.  In 1892 Pavie became [[Resident Minister]] in [[Bangkok]], where he encouraged a French policy which first sought to deny or ignore [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] [[sovereignty]] over [[Lao people|Lao]] territories on the east bank of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]], and secondly to suppress the slavery of upland [[Lao Theung]] and population transfers of [[Lao Loum]] by the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] as a prelude to establishing a [[protectorate]] in Laos. [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] reacted by denying [[French people|French]] trading interests, which by 1893 had increasingly involved military posturing and [[gunboat diplomacy]]. France and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] would position troops to deny each other's interests, resulting in a [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] siege of [[Khong Island]] in the south and a series of attacks on French garrisons in the north. The result was the [[Paknam Incident]] of 13 July 1893, the [[Franco-Siamese War]] (1893) and the ultimate recognition of French territorial claims in Laos.\n\n[[File:Art of Paknam incident.jpg|thumb|French warships bombarding the Siamese fort at Paknam.]]\n[[File:Map of Siam (territorial cessions).svg|thumb|Territories abandoned by Siam in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Franco-Siamese War resulted in the cession of Laos (dark blue) to France in 1893.]]\nThe French were aware that the east-bank territories of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]] were \"a depopulated, devastated country\" - the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] forced population transfers following the [[Lao rebellion (1826\u20131828)|Anouvong Rebellion]] had left only a fifth of the original population on the east bank, the majority of [[Lao Loum]] and [[Phuan people|Phuan]] peoples had been resettled to the areas around the [[Khorat Plateau]].  Territorial gains in 1893 were only a springboard to secure French control of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]], to deny [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] as much territorial control as possible by acquiring the Mekong's west-bank territories including the [[Khorat Plateau]], and by negotiating stable borders with [[British Burma]] along the former territories which paid tribute to the [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang]]. France settled a treaty with [[China]] in 1895, gaining control of [[Luang Namtha]] and [[Phongsali]]. British control of the [[Shan States]] and French control of the upper Mekong increased tensions between the colonial rivals.  A joint commission completed its work in 1896 and the city of [[Muang Sing]] was gained by [[France]]; in exchange France recognized [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] sovereignty over the areas of the [[Chaophraya River]] basin.  However, the issue of [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] control over the [[Khorat Plateau]], which was ethnically and historically [[Lao people|Lao]], was left open for the French, as was [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] control over the [[Malay Peninsula]] which favored British interests. Political events in [[Europe]] would shape [[French Indochina|French Indochinese]] policy however, and between 1896 and 1904 a new political party took power in Paris which viewed Britain much more as an ally than as a colonial rival.  In 1904 Britain and France signed the [[Entente Cordiale]], which developed ultimately into part of [[Allies of World War I|the alliance]] against [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] that fought the [[First World War]] in 1914\u20131918.  The Entente Cordiale agreement established respective spheres of influence in [[Southeast Asia]], although [[French colonial empire|French]] territorial demands would continue until 1907 in [[Cambodia]].\n\n=== 1893-1939 ===\nThe [[French Protectorate of Laos]] established two (and at times three) administrative regions governed from [[Vietnam]] in 1893.  It was not until 1899 that [[Laos]] became centrally administered by a single [[Resident (title)|Resident Superieur]] based in [[Savannakhet]], and later in [[Vientiane]].  The [[French people|French]] chose to establish [[Vientiane]] as the colonial capital for two reasons, firstly it was more centrally located between the central provinces and [[Luang Prabang]], and secondly the [[French people|French]] were aware of the symbolic importance of rebuilding the former capital of the [[Kingdom of Lan Xang|Lan Xang Kingdom]] which the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] had destroyed.\n\nAs part of [[French Indochina]] both [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] were seen as a source of raw materials and labor for the more important holdings in [[Vietnam]]. [[French colonial empire|French colonial]] presence in [[Laos]] was light; the [[Resident (title)|Resident Superieur]] was responsible for all colonial administration from taxation to justice and public works.  The [[French people|French]] maintained a military presence in the colonial capital under the ''Garde Indigene'' made up of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] soldiers under a [[French people|French]] commander. In important provincial cities like [[Luang Prabang]], [[Savannakhet]], and [[Pakse]] there would be an assistant [[Resident (title)|resident]], police, paymaster, postmaster, schoolteacher and a doctor. [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] filled most upper level and mid-level positions within the bureaucracy, with [[Lao people|Lao]] being employed as junior clerks, translators, kitchen staff and general laborers. Villages remained under the traditional authority of the local headmen or ''chao muang''.  Throughout the colonial administration in [[Laos]] the [[French colonial empire|French]] presence never amounted to more than a few thousand [[Europeans]]. The [[French colonial empire|French]] concentrated on the development of infrastructure, the abolition of slavery and indentured servitude (although [[corvee labor]] was still in effect), trade including [[opium]] production, and most importantly the collection of taxes.\n\nUnder the French rule, the Vietnamese were encouraged to migrate to Laos, which was seen by the French colonists as a rational solution to a practical problem within the confines of an Indochina-wide colonial space.<ref name=\"S\u00f8renIvarsson\">Ivarsson, S\u00f8ren (2008).

The first serious resistance to the [[French colonial empire|French colonial]] presence began in southern Laos, as the ''Holy Man\u2019s Rebellion'' led by [[Ong Keo]], and would last until 1910.  The rebellion began in 1901 when a [[French people|French]] commissioner in [[Salavan Province|Salavan]] was attempting to pacify [[Lao Theung]] tribes for taxation and [[corvee labor]], [[Ong Keo]] provoked anti-French sentiment and in response the [[French people|French]] burned a local temple.  The commissioner and his troops were massacred and a general uprising began throughout the [[Bolaven Plateau]]. [[Ong Keo]] would be killed by [[French colonial empire|French]] forces, but for several years his harassment and protests gained popularity in the southern [[Laos]].  It was not until the movement spread to the [[Khorat Plateau]] and threatened to become an international incident involving [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] that several [[French colonial empire|French]] columns of the ''Garde Indigene'' converged to put down the rebellion.  In the north [[Tai Lu]] groups from the areas around [[Phongsali]] and [[Muang Sing]] also began to rebel against [[French colonial empire|French]] attempts at taxation and [[corvee labor]].\n\n[[File:Market in Luang Prabangpre 1900.png|thumb|left|Market in Luang Prabang c. 1900 CE.]]\nIn 1914 the [[Tai Lu]] king had fled to the [[China|Chinese]] portions of the [[Sipsong Panna]], where he began a two-year guerilla campaign against the [[French colonial empire|French]] in northern [[Laos]], which required three military expeditions to suppress and resulted in direct [[French Protectorate of Laos|French]] control of [[Muang Sing]]. In northeast [[Laos]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Lao Theung]] rebelled against [[French colonial empire|French]] attempts to tax the [[opium]] trade which resulted in another rebellion from 1914\u20131917.  By 1915 most of northeast [[Laos]] was controlled by [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Lao Theung]] rebels.  The [[French colonial empire|French]] dispatched the largest military presence yet to [[Laos]] which included 160 [[French people|French]] officers and 2500 [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] troops divided in two columns.  The [[French colonial empire|French]] drove the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] led rebels across the [[China|Chinese]] border and placed [[Phongsali]] under direct colonial control.  Yet northeastern [[Laos]] was still not entirely pacified and a [[Hmong people|Hmong]] shaman named [[Pa Chay Vue]] attempted to establish a [[Hmong people|Hmong]] homeland through a rebellion (pejoratively termed the [[War of the Insane|Madman's War]]) which lasted from 1919\u20131921.\n\nBy 1920 the majority of [[French Protectorate of Laos|French Laos]] was at peace and colonial order had been established.  In 1928 the first school for the training of [[Lao people|Lao]] civil servants was established, and allowed for the upward mobility of [[Lao people|Lao]] to fill positions occupied by the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]].  Throughout the 1920s and 1930s [[France]] attempted to implement Western, particularly [[French people|French]], education, modern healthcare and medicine, and public works with mixed success.  The budget for [[French Protectorate of Laos|colonial Laos]] was secondary to [[Hanoi]], and the worldwide [[Great Depression]] further restricted funds.  It was also in the 1920s and 1930s that the first strings of [[Lao people|Lao]] nationalist identity emerged due to the work of Prince [[Phetsarath Rattanavongsa]] and the French [[Ecole francaise d'Extreme Orient|Ecole Francaise d\u2019Extreme Orient]] to restore ancient monuments, temples, and conduct general research into [[Lao people|Lao]] history, literature, art and architecture. [[French people|French]] interest in indigenous history served a dual purpose in [[Laos]] it reinforced the image of the colonial mission as protection against [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] domination, and was also a legitimate route for scholarship.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n===World War II===\nDeveloping [[Lao people|Lao]] national identity gained importance in 1938 with the rise of the ultranationalist prime minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Phibunsongkhram]] in [[Bangkok]]. [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Phibunsongkhram]] renamed [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] to [[Thailand]], a name change which was part of a larger political movement to unify all [[Tai peoples]] under the central [[Thai people|Thai]] of [[Bangkok]].  The [[French people|French]] viewed these developments with alarm, but the [[Vichy government|Vichy Government]] was diverted by events in [[Europe]] and [[World War II]].  Despite a non-aggression treaty signed in June 1940, [[Thailand]] took advantage of the [[French colonial empire|French]] position and initiated the [[Franco-Thai War]]. The war concluded unfavorably for [[Lao people|Lao]] interests with the ''Treaty of Tokyo'', and the loss of trans-Mekong territories of Xainyaburi and part of [[Champasak Province|Champasak]].  The result was [[Lao people|Lao]] distrust of the [[French people|French]] and the first overtly national cultural movement in [[Laos]], which was in the odd position of having limited [[French people|French]] support.  Charles Rochet the French Director of Public Education in [[Vientiane]], and Lao intellectuals led by Nyuy Aphai and [[Katay Don Sasorith]] began the Movement for National Renovation.\n\nYet the wider impact of [[World War II]] had little effect on [[Laos]] until February 1945, when a detachment from the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] moved into [[Xieng Khouang Province|Xieng Khouang]].  The [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] preempted that the [[Vichy government|Vichy]] administration of [[French Indochina]] under Admiral Decoux would be replaced by a representative of the [[Free French]] loyal to [[Charles DeGaulle]] and initiated [[Japanese coup d'\u00e9tat in French Indochina|Operation Meigo]] (\"bright moon\").  The [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] succeeded in the [[internment]] of the [[French people|French]] living in [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]], but in the remote areas of [[Laos]] the [[French colonial empire|French]] were able with the help of the [[Lao people|Lao]] and ''Garde Indigene'' to establish jungle bases which were supplied by [[British Empire|British]] airdrops from [[Burma]]. However, [[French colonial empire|French]] control in [[Laos]] had been sidelined.<ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n===Lao Issara and Independence===\n1945 was a watershed year in the history of [[Laos]], under Japanese pressure King [[Sisavangvong]] declared independence in April. The move allowed the various independence movements in [[Laos]] including the Lao Seri and Lao Pen Lao to coalesce into the [[Lao Issara]] or \u201cFree Lao\u201d movement which was led by Prince [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa|Phetsarath]] and opposed the return of [[Laos]] to the [[French Protectorate of Laos|French]]. The [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] surrender on 15 August 1945 emboldened pro-French factions and Prince [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa|Phetsarath]] was dismissed by King [[Sisavangvong]]. Undeterred Prince [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa|Phetsarath]] staged a coup in September and placed the royal family in [[Luang Prabang]] under house arrest. On 12 October 1945 the [[Lao Issara]] government was declared under the civil administration of Prince [[Phetsarath]].  In the next six months the [[French colonial empire|French]] rallied against the [[Lao Issara]] and were able to reassert control over [[French Indochina in World War II|Indochina]] in April 1946.  The [[Lao Issara]] government fled to [[Thailand]], where they maintained opposition to the [[French colonial empire|French]] until 1949, when the group split over questions regarding relations with the [[Vietminh]] and the [[communist]] [[Pathet Lao]] was formed.  With the [[Lao Issara]] in exile, in August 1946 France instituted a [[constitutional monarchy]] in [[Laos]] headed by King [[Sisavangvong]], and [[Thailand]] agreed to return territories seized during the [[Franco-Thai War]] in exchange for a representation at the [[United Nations]].  The Franco-Lao General Convention of 1949 provided most members of the [[Lao Issara]] with a negotiated amnesty and sought appeasement by establishing the [[Kingdom of Laos]] a quasi-independent constitutional monarchy within the [[French Union]]. In 1950 additional powers were granted to the [[Royal Lao Government]] including training and assistance for a national army. On October 22, 1953, the Franco\u2013Lao Treaty of Amity and Association transferred remaining French powers to the independent [[Royal Lao Government]]. By 1954 the defeat at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bien Phu]] brought eight years of fighting with the [[Vietminh]], during the [[First Indochinese War]], to an end and [[France]] abandoned all claims to the colonies of [[French Indochina|Indochina]].<ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n==The Kingdom of Laos and the Lao Civil War (1953\u20131975)==\n{{main|Kingdom of Laos|Laotian Civil War|History of Laos since 1945}}\n\nElections were held in 1955, and the first coalition government, led by Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]], was formed in 1957. The coalition government collapsed in 1958. In 1960 Captain [[Kong Le]] staged a coup when the cabinet was away at the royal capital of Luang Prabang and demanded reformation of a neutralist government. The second coalition government, once again led by Souvanna Phouma, was not successful in holding power. Rightist forces under General [[Phoumi Nosavan]] drove out the neutralist government from power later that same year. The North Vietnamese invaded Laos between 1958\u20131959 to create the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].\n\nA second Geneva conference, held in 1961\u201362, provided for the independence and [[International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos|neutrality of Laos]], but the agreement meant little in reality and the war soon resumed. Growing North Vietnamese military presence in the country increasingly drew Laos into the [[Second Indochina War]] (1954\u20131975). As a result, for nearly a decade, eastern Laos was subjected to some of the heaviest bombing in the history of warfare [https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-12-11-laos-bombs_x.htm], as the U.S. sought to destroy the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] that passed through Laos and defeat the Communist forces. The North Vietnamese also heavily backed the [[Pathet Lao]] and repeatedly invaded Laos. The government and army of Laos were backed by the USA during the conflict. The United States trained both regular Royal Lao forces and irregular forces among whom many were the Hmong and other ethnic minorities.\n\nShortly after the [[Paris Peace Accords]] led to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam, a ceasefire between the Pathet Lao and the government led to a new coalition government. However, North Vietnam never withdrew from Laos and the Pathet Lao remained little more than a proxy army for Vietnamese interests. After the fall of South Vietnam to communist forces in April 1975, the Pathet Lao with the backing of North Vietnam were able to take [[Taking of Vientiane|total power with little resistance]]. On December 2, 1975, the king was forced to abdicate his throne and the Lao People's Democratic Republic was established. Around 300,000 people out of a total population of 3 million left Laos by crossing the border into Thailand following the end of the civil war.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Courtois|first1=Stephane|last2=Werth|first2=Nicolas|last3=Panne|first3=Jean-Louis|last4=Paczkowski|first4=Andrzej|last5=Bartosek|first5=Karel|last6=Margolin|first6=Jean-Louis|displayauthors=1|title=The Black Book of Communism|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-674-07608-2|page=575|title-link=The Black Book of Communism}}</ref><ref name=\"Manich\"/> :-)\n\n==The Lao People's Democratic Republic (1975\u2013present)==\n{{main|History of Laos since 1945}}\nThe new communist government led by [[Kaysone Phomvihane]] imposed centralized economic decision-making and incarcerated many members of the previous government and military in \"re-education camps\" which also included the Hmongs.

Lan Xang existed as a unified kingdom from 1357\u20131707, divided into the three rival kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]], [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], and [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] from 1707\u20131779, fell to [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] suzerainty from 1779\u20131893, and was reunified under the [[French Protectorate of Laos]] in 1893.

The first archaeological explorations of Laos began with French explorers acting under the auspices of the [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]].

Also known as the \"Land of a million elephants under the white parasol\" the kingdom's name alludes to the power of the kingship and formidable war machine of the early kingdom. The founding of Lan Xang was recorded in 1353, after a series of conquests by [[Fa Ngum]].  From 1353\u20131560 the capital of Lan Xang was [[Luang Prabang]] (known alternately as ''Muang Sua'' and ''Xieng Dong Xieng Thong''). Under successive kings the kingdom expanded its sphere of influence over an area that now incorporates all of modern [[Laos]], the [[Sip Song Chau Tai|Sipsong Chu Tai]] of [[Vietnam]], [[Sipsong Panna]] of Southern [[China]], [[Khorat Plateau]] region of [[Thailand]], and the [[Stung Treng]] region of Northern [[Cambodia]].\n\nLan Xang existed as a sovereign kingdom for over 350 years. The first serious foreign invasion came from the [[Dai Viet]] in 1479, which was defeated, though leaving the capital of [[Luang Prabang]] largely destroyed. The first half of the sixteenth century allowed for the power, prestige and cultural influence of the kingdom to be restored under a series of strong kings (see Souvanna Balang, [[Visunarat|Vixun]], [[Photisarath]]). In the 1540s a series of succession disputes in the neighboring [[Kingdom of Lanna]], created a regional rivalry between [[Burma]], [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] and Lan Xang. In 1540 Lan Xang defeated an incursion from [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]]. By 1545 the [[Kingdom of Lanna]] was attacked by the [[Burma|Burmese]] and then [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]]. Lan Xang entered into an alliance with [[Lanna Kingdom|Lanna]], and aided in the defense of the kingdom. In 1547 the kingdoms of Lan Xang and [[Lanna Kingdom|Lanna]] were briefly unified under [[Photisarath]] of Lan Xang and his son [[Setthathirath]] in [[Lanna Kingdom|Lanna]]. [[Setthathirath]] would go on to become the king of Lan Xang on the death of his father, and become one of the greatest kings of Lan Xang.\n\nThe [[Burma|Burmese]] [[Toungoo Dynasty]] began a series of expansions during the late 1550s which culminated under King [[Bayinnaung]]. [[Setthathirath]] moved the capital of Lan Xang from [[Luang Prabang]] to [[Vientiane]] in 1560, to better defend against the threat of [[Burma]] and to more ably administer the central and southern provinces. [[Bayinnaung]] subjugated the [[Kingdom of Lanna]] and went on to destroy the kingdom and city of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] in 1564.  King [[Setthathirath]] fought two successful guerilla campaigns against the [[Burma|Burmese]] invasions, leaving Lan Xang the only independent [[Tai peoples|Tai]] kingdom until his death in 1572, while on campaign against the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]]. The [[Burma|Burmese]] succeeded with the third invasion of Lan Xang around 1573, and Lan Xang became a vassal state until 1591 when the son of [[Setthathirath]], Nokeo Koumane, was able to successfully reassert independence.\n\nLan Xang recovered and reached the apex of its political and economic power during the seventeenth century under King [[Sourigna Vongsa]], who became the longest reigning of Lan Xang's monarchs (1637\u20131694).  In the 1640s the first European explorers to leave a detailed account of the kingdom arrived looking to establish trade and secure Christian converts, both were ultimately largely unsuccessful. Upon the death of [[Sourigna Vongsa]] a succession dispute erupted and the kingdom of Lan Xang was ultimately divided into constituent kingdoms in 1707.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n==Regional Kingdoms (1707\u20131779)==\n{{main|Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Kingdom of Vientiane|Kingdom of Champasak}}\n[[File:Laos - Division territ\u00f2riala v\u00e8rs 1750 (vuege).png|thumb|right|Southeast Asia around 1707 until 1828 showing the kingdoms of Vientiane, Luang Prabang, Champasak and the principality of Phuan (Xieng Khuang)]]\nBeginning in 1707 the [[Lao people|Lao]] kingdom of [[Lan Xang]] was partitioned into regional kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] and later [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] (1713).  The [[Kingdom of Vientiane]] was the strongest of the three, with [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]] extending influence across the [[Khorat Plateau]] (now part of modern [[Thailand]]) and conflicting with the [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang]] for control of the [[Xieng Khouang Province|Xieng Khouang Plateau]] (on the border of modern [[Vietnam]]).\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang]] was the first of the regional kingdoms to emerge in 1707, when King Xai Ong Hue of [[Lan Xang]] was challenged by Kingkitsarat, the grandson of [[Sourigna Vongsa]].  Xai Ong Hue and his family had sought asylum in [[Vietnam]] when they were exiled during the reign of [[Sourigna Vongsa]].  Xai Ong Hue gained the support of the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] Emperor [[L\u00ea Hy T\u00f4ng|Le Duy Hiep]] in exchange for recognition of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] suzerainty over [[Lan Xang]]. At the head of a [[Vietnam]]ese army Xai Ong Hue attacked [[Vientiane]] and executed King Nantharat another claimant to the throne.  In response [[Sourigna Vongsa]]\u2019s grandson Kingkitsarat rebelled and moved with his own army from the [[Sipsong Panna]] toward [[Luang Prabang]].  Kingkitsarat then moved south to challenge Xai Ong Hue in [[Vientiane]].  Xai Ong Hue then turned toward the [[Kingdom of Ayutthaya]] for support, and an army was dispatched which rather than supporting Xai Ong Hue arbitrated the division between [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] and [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]].\n\nIn 1713, the southern [[Lao people|Lao]] nobility continued the rebellion against Xai Ong Hue under [[Nokasad]], a nephew of [[Sourigna Vongsa]], and the [[Kingdom of Champasak]] emerged.  The [[Kingdom of Champasak]] comprised the area south of the [[Xe Bang Fai River|Xe Bang River]] as far as [[Stung Treng Province|Stung Treng]] together with the areas of the lower [[Mun River|Mun]] and [[Chi River|Chi]] rivers on the [[Khorat Plateau]].  Although less populous than either [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] or [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] occupied an important position for regional power and international trade via the [[Mekong River]].\n\nThroughout the 1760s and 1770s the kingdoms of [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] and [[Burma]] competed against each other in a bitter armed rivalry, and sought out alliances with the [[Lao people|Lao]] kingdoms to strengthen their relative positions by adding to their own forces and denying them to their enemy. As a result, the use of competing alliances would further militarize the conflict between the northerly [[Lao people|Lao]] kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] and [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]].  Between the two major [[Lao people|Lao]] kingdoms if an alliance with one was sought by either [[Burma]] or [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]], the other would tend to support the remaining side.  The network of alliances shifted with the political and military landscape throughout the latter half of the eighteenth century.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n==Siam and Suzerainty (1779\u20131893)==\n{{main|Thonburi Kingdom|Rattanakosin Kingdom}}\nBy 1779 General [[Taksin]] had driven the [[Toungoo Dynasty|Burmese]] from [[Siam]], had overrun the [[Lao people|Lao]] Kingdoms of [[Champasak Kingdom|Champasak]] and [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], and forced [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] to accept vassalage ([[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] had aided [[Siam]] during the siege of [[Vientiane]]).  Traditional power relationships in [[Southeast Asia]] followed the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala]] model, warfare was waged to secure population centers for [[corvee labor]], control regional trade, and confirm religious and secular authority by controlling potent [[Buddhist]] symbols ([[White elephant (animal)|white elephants]], important [[stupa]]s, temples, and [[Buddha]] images).  To legitimize the [[Thonburi Dynasty]], General [[Taksin]] seized the [[Emerald Buddha]] and [[Phra Bang]] images from [[Vientiane]]. [[Taksin]] also demanded that the ruling elites of the [[Lao people|Lao]] kingdoms and their royal families pledge [[vassalage]] to [[Siam]] in order to retain their regional autonomy in accordance with the [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala]] model. In the traditional [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala]] model, vassal kings retained their power to raise tax, discipline their own vassals, inflict capital punishment, and appoint their own officials.  Only matters of war, and succession required approval from the [[suzerain]].  Vassals were also expected to provide annual tribute of gold and silver (traditionally modeled into trees), provide tax and tax in-kind, raise support armies in time of war, and provide [[corvee labor]] for state projects.\n[[File:Emerald Buddha.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Emerald Buddha]]]]\nHowever, by 1782 [[Taksin]] had been deposed and [[Rama I]] was king of [[Siam]], and began a series of reforms which fundamentally altered the traditional [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandala]].  Many of the reforms took place to more closely administer and assimilate the [[Khorat Plateau]](or [[Isan]]) which was traditionally and culturally part of the Lao kingdoms\u2019 tributary networks.  In 1778, only [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] was a tributary of Siam, yet by the end of the reign of Rama I [[Sisaket (town)|Sisaket]], [[Ubon]], [[Roi Et]], [[Yasothon]], [[Khonkhaen|Khon Khaen]], and [[Kalasin]] paid tribute directly to [[Bangkok]].  According to [[Thai people|Thai]] records, by 1826 (less than fifty years) the number of towns and cities in [[Isan]] had grown from 13 to 35.  Forced population transfers from Lao areas were further reinforced by [[corvee labor]] projects and increased taxes.  Siam required labor to help rebuild from repeated Burmese invasions, and growing sea trade.  Increasing the productivity and population living on the [[Khorat Plateau]] provided the labor and material access to strengthen Siam.\n\nSiribunnyasan the last independent king of [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]] had died by 1780, and his sons Nanthasen, Inthavong, and [[Anouvong]] had been taken to [[Bangkok]] as prisoners during the sack of [[Vientiane]] in 1779.  The sons would become successive kings of [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]] (under Siamese suzerainty), beginning with Nanthasen in 1781.  Nanthasen was allowed to return to [[Vientiane]] with the [[Phra Bang]], the [[Palladium (protective image)|palladium]] of [[Lan Xang]], the [[Emerald Buddha]] remained in [[Bangkok]] and became an important symbol to the [[Lao people|Lao]] of their captivity.  One of Nanthasen's first acts was to seize Chao Somphu a [[Phuane|Phuan]] prince from [[Xieng Khouang province|Xieng Khouang]] who had entered into a tributary relationship with [[Vietnam]], and released him only when it was agreed that [[Xieng Khouang province|Xieng Khouang]] would also acknowledge Vientiane as suzerain.  In 1791, Anuruttha was confirmed by [[Rama I]] as king of [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]].  By 1792 Nanthasen had convinced [[Rama I]] that Anuruttha was secretly dealing with the [[Burma|Burmese]], and Siam allowed Nanthasen to lead an army and besiege and capture [[Luang Prabang]].  Anuruttha was sent to [[Bangkok]] as a prisoner, and only through diplomatic exchanges facilitated by [[China]], was Anuruttha released in 1795.  Soon after Anuruttha's release it was alleged that Nanthasen had been plotting with the governor of [[Nakhon Phanom]] to rebel against Siam. [[Rama I]] ordered the immediate arrest of Nanthasen, and soon after he died in captivity.  Inthavong (1795\u20131804) became the next king of [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], and dispatched armies to aide Siam against Burmese invasions in 1797 and 1802, and to capture the [[Sipsongchuthai|Sipsong Chau Tai]] (with his brother Anouvong as general).<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n===Anouvong\u2019s Rebellion and Lao Nationalism===\n{{main|Chao Anu Rebellion}}\n[[File:Chao Anouvong.jpg|thumbnail|right|180px|King [[Anouvong]], [[Kingdom of Vientiane]]]]\n[[Anouvong]] is a symbolic and controversial figure even today, his short lived rebellion against Siam from [[Anouvong's rebellion|1826\u20131829]] ultimately proved futile and led to the total annihilation of [[Vientiane]] as a kingdom and a city, yet among the Lao he remains a potent symbol of unyielding defiance and national identity. [[Thai people|Thai]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] histories record that [[Anouvong]] rebelled as the result of personal insult suffered at the funeral of [[Rama II of Thailand|Rama II]] in [[Bangkok]].  Yet, the [[Anouvong's rebellion|Anouvong Rebellion]] lasted three years and engulfed the whole of the [[Khorat Plateau]] for more complex reasons.\n\nThe history of forced population transfers, [[corvee labor]] projects, loss of national symbols and prestige (most notably the [[Emerald Buddha]]) formed the backdrop to specific actions taken by [[Rama III]] to directly annex the [[Isan]] region.  In 1812 [[Siam]] and [[Vietnam]] were at odds over the succession of the [[Cambodia]]n king, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] gained the upper hand with their chosen successor and [[Siam]] compensated itself by annexing territory on the [[Dangrek Mountains]] and along the [[Mekong River]] in [[Stung Treng Province|Stung Treng]].  As a result, Lao international trade along the [[Mekong River|Mekong]] was effectively blockaded, and heavy duties were imposed on Lao merchants who were viewed suspiciously by [[Siam]] for their trade with both the [[Cambodian people|Cambodians]] and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]].\n\nIn 1819 a rebellion in [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] provided [[Anouvong]] with opportunity, and he dispatched an army under his son Nyo who managed to suppress the conflict.  In exchange [[Anouvong]] successfully made the case that his son be crowned as king in [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]], which was confirmed by [[Bangkok]]. [[Anouvong]] had successfully expanded his influence throughout [[Kingdom of Vientiane|Vientiane]], [[Isan]], [[Xieng Khouang province|Xieng Khouang]] and now [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]]. [[Anouvong]] dispatched a number of diplomatic missions to [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]], which were viewed suspiciously in light of his growing regional influence.\n\nBy 1825 [[Rama II of Thailand|Rama II]] had died, and [[Rama III]] was consolidating his position against prince [[Mongkut]] ([[Rama IV]]).  In the ensuing power struggle before the accession of [[Rama III]] one of [[Anouvong]]\u2019s grandsons was killed.  When [[Anouvong]] arrived for the funerary services, he made several requests of the king [[Rama III]] which were dismissed including the return of his sister who had been captured in 1779, and Lao families which had been relocated to [[Saraburi]] near [[Bangkok]].  Before returning to [[Vientiane]], [[Anouvong]]\u2019s son Ngau, the crown prince, was forced to perform manual labor during which he was beaten.\n\nEarly in his reign, [[Rama III]] ordered a census of all peoples on the [[Khorat Plateau]], the census involved the forced tattooing of each villager\u2019s census number and name of their village.  The aim of the policy was to more tightly administer Lao territories from [[Bangkok]] and was facilitated by the nobility [[Siam]] had installed in the newly created cities throughout the region.  Popular resentment against the forced tattooing and increased taxes became ''[[casus belli]]'' for rebellion.\n\nToward the end of 1826 [[Anouvong]] was making military preparations for armed rebellion. [[Anouvong]]\u2019s strategy involved three objectives, first was to repatriate all ethnic [[Lao people|Lao]] living in [[Siam]] to the right bank of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]] and execute any Siamese engaged in the tattooing of [[Lao people|Lao]], the second objective was to consolidate [[Lao people|Lao]] power by forging an alliance with [[Chiang Mai]] and [[Luang Prabang]], the third and final goal was to gain international support from either the [[Vietnam]]ese, [[China|Chinese]], [[Burma|Burmese]] or [[British Empire|British]].  In January hostilities commenced, and the Lao armies were sent from [[Vientiane]] to capture [[Nakhon Ratchasima]], [[Kalasin]], and Lomsak.  From [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] forces rushed to take [[Ubon]] and Suvannaphum, while pursuing a [[scorched-earth]] policy ensuring the [[Lao people|Lao]] time to retreat.\n\n[[Anouvong]]\u2019s forces pushed south eventually to [[Saraburi]] to free the [[Lao people|Lao]] there, but the flood of refugees pushing north slowed the armies\u2019 retreat. [[Anouvong]] also severely underestimated the [[Siam]]ese arms stockpile, which under the terms of [[Burney Treaty]] had provided [[Siam]] with weaponry from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in [[Europe]].  A [[Lao people|Lao]] defense was staged at [[Nong Bua Lamphu]] the traditional Lao stronghold in the [[Isan]], but the [[Siam]]ese emerged victorious and leveled the city.  The [[Siam]]ese pushed north to take [[Vientiane]] and [[Anouvong]] fled southeast to the border with [[Vietnam]]. By 1828 [[Anouvong]] had been captured, tortured and sent to [[Bangkok]] with his family to die in a cage. [[Rama III]] ordered [[Bodindecha|Chao Bodin]] to return and level the city of [[Vientiane]], and forcibly move the entire population of the former Lao capital to the [[Isan]] region.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n===Aftermath and Vietnamese Intervention===\nFollowing the [[Anouvong's rebellion|Anouvong Rebellion]] Siam and Vietnam were increasingly at odds over control of the [[Indochinese Peninsula]]. In 1831 [[Minh Mang|Emperor Minh Mang]] sent [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] troops to seize [[Xieng Khouang province|Xieng Khouang]] and annexed the area as the province of Tran Ninh. Also in 1831 and again in 1833 King Mantha Tourath sent a tributary mission to the [[Vietnam]]ese, which were quietly ignored so as not to antagonize the [[Siam]]ese further.  In 1893 these tributary missions from [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] were used by the [[French colonial empire|French]] as part of a legal argument for all the territories on the east bank of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]]. In late 1831 [[Siam]] and [[Vietnam]] had a series of wars ([[Siamese-Vietnamese War (1831-1834)|Siamese-Vietnamese War 1831\u20131834]], and [[Siamese-Vietnamese War (1841-1845)|Siamese-Vietnamese War 1841\u20131845]]) over control of [[Xieng Khouang province|Xieng Khouang]] and [[Cambodia]].\n\nIn the aftermath of [[Vientiane]]'s destruction the Siamese divided the [[Lao people|Lao]] lands into three administrative regions.  In the north, the king of [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang|Luang Prabang]] and a small Siamese garrison controlled [[Luang Prabang]], the [[Sipsong Panna]], and [[Sipsongchuthai|Sipsong Chao Tai]].  The central region was administered from [[Nong Khai]] and extended to the borders of Tran Ninh ([[Xieng Khouang province|Xieng Khouang]]) and south to [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]].  The southern regions were controlled from [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champasak]] and extended to areas bordering [[Cochin China]] and [[Cambodia]]. From the 1830s through the 1860s small rebellions took place across [[Lao people|Lao]] lands and the [[Khorat Plateau]], but they lacked both the scale and coordination of the [[Anouvong's rebellion|Anouvong Rebellion]]. Importantly, at the end of each rebellion Siamese troops would return to their administrative centers, and no Lao region was allowed to have a buildup of force which could have been used in rebellion.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n===Population Transfers and Slavery===\n[[File:Ruins in Vientiane, depicted by Louis Delaporte (c.1867).jpg|thumbnail|right|Ruins in Vientiane, depicted by Louis Delaporte during the Mekong Expedition led by Francis Garnier (c. 1867).]]\nPopulation transfers of ethnic [[Lao people|Lao]] to [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] began in 1779 with [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] suzerainty. Artisans and members of the court were forcibly moved to [[Saraburi]] near [[Bangkok]], and several thousand farmers and peasant who were transported throughout [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] to [[Phetchaburi]], [[Ratchaburi]], and Nakhon Chaisi in the southwest and to [[Prachinburi]] and [[Chanthaburi]] in the southeast. However, massive deportations estimated between 100,000\u2013300,000 people began following the defeat of King [[Anouvong]] in 1828, and would continue until the 1870s. From 1828\u20131830 over 66,000 people were forcibly relocated from [[Vientiane]]. In 1834 the first of several relocations of the [[Phuan people|Phuan]] areas of [[Xieng Khouang Province|Xieng Khouang]] began, transferring more than 6,000 people. Most of those relocated were settled in the [[Isan]] region and were considered that ''cha loei'' or \u201cwar slaves\u201d who were to serve as [[serfs]] in underpopulated areas for the [[Thai people|Thai]] elite. The result changed the demographics and cultural traditions of [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]] and continues today with a five-fold disparity between the ethnic [[Lao people|Lao]] living on the West Bank of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]] and those left in the East in what is today [[Laos]].\n\nAlthough slavery existed in [[Lao people|Lao]] areas before the rebellion in 1828, the defeat and subsequent removal of most ethnic [[Lao people|Lao]] left a depopulated and vulnerable position for the remaining people of the East Bank of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]]. [[Lao Theung]] hill tribes which had little involvement in the 1828 rebellion bore the brunt of organized slave raids into [[Laos]] and became known collectively and pejoratively in [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Lao language|Lao]] as ''kha'' or \u201cslaves.\u201d [[Lao Theung]] were hunted or sold into slavery frequent organized raiding parties from [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]], [[Laos]] and [[China]]. Larger tribes of [[Lao Theung]], such as the [[Brao people|Brao]], would conduct slave raids against weaker tribes.  The raids continued throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century, a [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] military campaign in Laos in 1876 was described by a British observer as having been \"transformed into slave-hunting raids on a large scale.\"\n\nThe population transfers and slave raids ameliorated toward the end of the nineteenth century when European observers and anti-slavery groups made their presence increasingly difficult for the [[Bangkok]] elite. In 1880 both slave raiding and trading became illegal, although debt slavery would persist until 1905 by decree of King [[Chulalongkorn]].  The [[French Indochina|French]] would use the existence of slavery in [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] as one of the major professed motivations for establishing a [[French Protectorate of Laos|Protectorate of Laos]] during the 1880s and 1890s.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n[[File:Soldier Black-Flag.jpg|thumb|180px|right|A soldier of the Black Flag Army, 1885]]\n\n===The Haw Wars===\n{{main|Haw Wars}}\nIn the 1840s sporadic rebellions, slave raids, and movement of refugees throughout the areas that would become modern [[Laos]] left whole regions politically and militarily weak.  In [[China]] the [[Qing Dynasty]] was pushing south to incorporate hill peoples into the central administration, at first floods of refugees and later bands of rebels from the [[Taiping Rebellion]] pushed into [[Lao people|Lao]] lands.  The rebel groups became known by their banners and included the Yellow (or Striped) Flags, Red Flags and the Black Flags. The bandit groups rampaged throughout the countryside, with little response from [[Siam]].\n\nDuring the early and mid-nineteenth century the first [[Lao Sung]] including the [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Mien people|Mien]], [[Yao people|Yao]] and other [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] groups began settling in the higher elevations of [[Phongsali Province, Laos|Phongsali]] province and northeast [[Laos]].  The influx of immigration was facilitated by the same political weakness which had given shelter to the [[Black Flag Army|Haw]] bandits and left large depopulated areas throughout [[Laos]].\n\nBy the 1860s the first [[French people|French]] explorers were pushing north charting the path of the [[Mekong River]], with hope of a navigable waterway to southern [[China]]. Among the early [[French Indochina|French]] explorers was an expedition led by [[Francis Garnier]], who was killed during an expedition by [[Black Flag Army|Haw]] rebels in [[Tonkin]].  The [[French Indochina|French]] would increasingly conduct military campaigns against the Haw in both [[Laos]] and [[Vietnam]] ([[Tonkin]]) until the 1880s.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n==Colonialism and the French Protectorate of Laos (1893\u20131953)==\n{{main|French Protectorate of Laos|First Indochina War|History of Laos since 1945}}\n[[File:AJMPavie.jpg|thumbnail|180px|left|[[Auguste Pavie]], First Governor-General of the [[French Protectorate of Laos]]]]\n\n=== Origins of French colonialism in Laos ===\n[[French people|French]] colonial interests in [[Laos]] began with the exploratory missions of [[Doudart De Lagree|Doudart de Lagree]] and [[Francis Garnier]] during the 1860s. France hoped to utilize the [[Mekong River]] as a route to southern [[China]].  Although the Mekong is unnavigable due to a number of rapids, the hope was that the river might be tamed with the help of French engineering and a combination of railways. In 1886 [[Great Britain|Britain]] secured the right to appoint a representative in [[Chiang Mai]], in northern [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]].  To counter [[British people|British]] control in [[Burma]] and growing influence in Siam, that same year [[France]] sought to establish representation in [[Luang Prabang]], and dispatched [[Auguste Pavie]] to secure [[French people|French]] interests.\n\nPavie and French auxiliaries arrived in [[Luang Prabang]] in 1887 in time to witness an attack on [[Luang Prabang]] by [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Tai peoples|Tai]] bandits who hoped to liberate the brothers of their leader [[\u0110\u00e8o V\u0103n Tr\u1ecb]], who were being held prisoner by the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]]. Pavie prevented the capture of the ailing King [[Oun Kham]] by ferrying him away from the burning city to safety.  The incident won the gratitude of the king, provided an opportunity for [[France]] to gain control of the [[Sipsongchuthai|Sipsong Chu Thai]] as part of [[Tonkin]] in [[French Indochina]], and demonstrated the weakness of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] in Laos.  In 1892 Pavie became [[Resident Minister]] in [[Bangkok]], where he encouraged a French policy which first sought to deny or ignore [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] [[sovereignty]] over [[Lao people|Lao]] territories on the east bank of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]], and secondly to suppress the slavery of upland [[Lao Theung]] and population transfers of [[Lao Loum]] by the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] as a prelude to establishing a [[protectorate]] in Laos. [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] reacted by denying [[French people|French]] trading interests, which by 1893 had increasingly involved military posturing and [[gunboat diplomacy]]. France and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] would position troops to deny each other's interests, resulting in a [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] siege of [[Khong Island]] in the south and a series of attacks on French garrisons in the north. The result was the [[Paknam Incident]] of 13 July 1893, the [[Franco-Siamese War]] (1893) and the ultimate recognition of French territorial claims in Laos.\n\n[[File:Art of Paknam incident.jpg|thumb|French warships bombarding the Siamese fort at Paknam.]]\n[[File:Map of Siam (territorial cessions).svg|thumb|Territories abandoned by Siam in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Franco-Siamese War resulted in the cession of Laos (dark blue) to France in 1893.]]\nThe French were aware that the east-bank territories of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]] were \"a depopulated, devastated country\" - the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] forced population transfers following the [[Lao rebellion (1826\u20131828)|Anouvong Rebellion]] had left only a fifth of the original population on the east bank, the majority of [[Lao Loum]] and [[Phuan people|Phuan]] peoples had been resettled to the areas around the [[Khorat Plateau]].  Territorial gains in 1893 were only a springboard to secure French control of the [[Mekong River|Mekong]], to deny [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] as much territorial control as possible by acquiring the Mekong's west-bank territories including the [[Khorat Plateau]], and by negotiating stable borders with [[British Burma]] along the former territories which paid tribute to the [[Kingdom of Luang Prabang]]. France settled a treaty with [[China]] in 1895, gaining control of [[Luang Namtha]] and [[Phongsali]]. British control of the [[Shan States]] and French control of the upper Mekong increased tensions between the colonial rivals.  A joint commission completed its work in 1896 and the city of [[Muang Sing]] was gained by [[France]]; in exchange France recognized [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] sovereignty over the areas of the [[Chaophraya River]] basin.  However, the issue of [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] control over the [[Khorat Plateau]], which was ethnically and historically [[Lao people|Lao]], was left open for the French, as was [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] control over the [[Malay Peninsula]] which favored British interests. Political events in [[Europe]] would shape [[French Indochina|French Indochinese]] policy however, and between 1896 and 1904 a new political party took power in Paris which viewed Britain much more as an ally than as a colonial rival.  In 1904 Britain and France signed the [[Entente Cordiale]], which developed ultimately into part of [[Allies of World War I|the alliance]] against [[Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] that fought the [[First World War]] in 1914\u20131918.  The Entente Cordiale agreement established respective spheres of influence in [[Southeast Asia]], although [[French colonial empire|French]] territorial demands would continue until 1907 in [[Cambodia]].\n\n=== 1893-1939 ===\nThe [[French Protectorate of Laos]] established two (and at times three) administrative regions governed from [[Vietnam]] in 1893.  It was not until 1899 that [[Laos]] became centrally administered by a single [[Resident (title)|Resident Superieur]] based in [[Savannakhet]], and later in [[Vientiane]].  The [[French people|French]] chose to establish [[Vientiane]] as the colonial capital for two reasons, firstly it was more centrally located between the central provinces and [[Luang Prabang]], and secondly the [[French people|French]] were aware of the symbolic importance of rebuilding the former capital of the [[Kingdom of Lan Xang|Lan Xang Kingdom]] which the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] had destroyed.\n\nAs part of [[French Indochina]] both [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] were seen as a source of raw materials and labor for the more important holdings in [[Vietnam]]. [[French colonial empire|French colonial]] presence in [[Laos]] was light; the [[Resident (title)|Resident Superieur]] was responsible for all colonial administration from taxation to justice and public works.  The [[French people|French]] maintained a military presence in the colonial capital under the ''Garde Indigene'' made up of [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] soldiers under a [[French people|French]] commander. In important provincial cities like [[Luang Prabang]], [[Savannakhet]], and [[Pakse]] there would be an assistant [[Resident (title)|resident]], police, paymaster, postmaster, schoolteacher and a doctor. [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] filled most upper level and mid-level positions within the bureaucracy, with [[Lao people|Lao]] being employed as junior clerks, translators, kitchen staff and general laborers. Villages remained under the traditional authority of the local headmen or ''chao muang''.  Throughout the colonial administration in [[Laos]] the [[French colonial empire|French]] presence never amounted to more than a few thousand [[Europeans]]. The [[French colonial empire|French]] concentrated on the development of infrastructure, the abolition of slavery and indentured servitude (although [[corvee labor]] was still in effect), trade including [[opium]] production, and most importantly the collection of taxes.\n\nUnder the French rule, the Vietnamese were encouraged to migrate to Laos, which was seen by the French colonists as a rational solution to a practical problem within the confines of an Indochina-wide colonial space.<ref name=\"S\u00f8renIvarsson\">Ivarsson, S\u00f8ren (2008).

The first serious resistance to the [[French colonial empire|French colonial]] presence began in southern Laos, as the ''Holy Man\u2019s Rebellion'' led by [[Ong Keo]], and would last until 1910.  The rebellion began in 1901 when a [[French people|French]] commissioner in [[Salavan Province|Salavan]] was attempting to pacify [[Lao Theung]] tribes for taxation and [[corvee labor]], [[Ong Keo]] provoked anti-French sentiment and in response the [[French people|French]] burned a local temple.  The commissioner and his troops were massacred and a general uprising began throughout the [[Bolaven Plateau]]. [[Ong Keo]] would be killed by [[French colonial empire|French]] forces, but for several years his harassment and protests gained popularity in the southern [[Laos]].  It was not until the movement spread to the [[Khorat Plateau]] and threatened to become an international incident involving [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] that several [[French colonial empire|French]] columns of the ''Garde Indigene'' converged to put down the rebellion.  In the north [[Tai Lu]] groups from the areas around [[Phongsali]] and [[Muang Sing]] also began to rebel against [[French colonial empire|French]] attempts at taxation and [[corvee labor]].\n\n[[File:Market in Luang Prabangpre 1900.png|thumb|left|Market in Luang Prabang c. 1900 CE.]]\nIn 1914 the [[Tai Lu]] king had fled to the [[China|Chinese]] portions of the [[Sipsong Panna]], where he began a two-year guerilla campaign against the [[French colonial empire|French]] in northern [[Laos]], which required three military expeditions to suppress and resulted in direct [[French Protectorate of Laos|French]] control of [[Muang Sing]]. In northeast [[Laos]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Lao Theung]] rebelled against [[French colonial empire|French]] attempts to tax the [[opium]] trade which resulted in another rebellion from 1914\u20131917.  By 1915 most of northeast [[Laos]] was controlled by [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Lao Theung]] rebels.  The [[French colonial empire|French]] dispatched the largest military presence yet to [[Laos]] which included 160 [[French people|French]] officers and 2500 [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] troops divided in two columns.  The [[French colonial empire|French]] drove the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] led rebels across the [[China|Chinese]] border and placed [[Phongsali]] under direct colonial control.  Yet northeastern [[Laos]] was still not entirely pacified and a [[Hmong people|Hmong]] shaman named [[Pa Chay Vue]] attempted to establish a [[Hmong people|Hmong]] homeland through a rebellion (pejoratively termed the [[War of the Insane|Madman's War]]) which lasted from 1919\u20131921.\n\nBy 1920 the majority of [[French Protectorate of Laos|French Laos]] was at peace and colonial order had been established.  In 1928 the first school for the training of [[Lao people|Lao]] civil servants was established, and allowed for the upward mobility of [[Lao people|Lao]] to fill positions occupied by the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]].  Throughout the 1920s and 1930s [[France]] attempted to implement Western, particularly [[French people|French]], education, modern healthcare and medicine, and public works with mixed success.  The budget for [[French Protectorate of Laos|colonial Laos]] was secondary to [[Hanoi]], and the worldwide [[Great Depression]] further restricted funds.  It was also in the 1920s and 1930s that the first strings of [[Lao people|Lao]] nationalist identity emerged due to the work of Prince [[Phetsarath Rattanavongsa]] and the French [[Ecole francaise d'Extreme Orient|Ecole Francaise d\u2019Extreme Orient]] to restore ancient monuments, temples, and conduct general research into [[Lao people|Lao]] history, literature, art and architecture. [[French people|French]] interest in indigenous history served a dual purpose in [[Laos]] it reinforced the image of the colonial mission as protection against [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siamese]] domination, and was also a legitimate route for scholarship.<ref name=\"Viravond\"/><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n===World War II===\nDeveloping [[Lao people|Lao]] national identity gained importance in 1938 with the rise of the ultranationalist prime minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Phibunsongkhram]] in [[Bangkok]]. [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram|Phibunsongkhram]] renamed [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]] to [[Thailand]], a name change which was part of a larger political movement to unify all [[Tai peoples]] under the central [[Thai people|Thai]] of [[Bangkok]].  The [[French people|French]] viewed these developments with alarm, but the [[Vichy government|Vichy Government]] was diverted by events in [[Europe]] and [[World War II]].  Despite a non-aggression treaty signed in June 1940, [[Thailand]] took advantage of the [[French colonial empire|French]] position and initiated the [[Franco-Thai War]]. The war concluded unfavorably for [[Lao people|Lao]] interests with the ''Treaty of Tokyo'', and the loss of trans-Mekong territories of Xainyaburi and part of [[Champasak Province|Champasak]].  The result was [[Lao people|Lao]] distrust of the [[French people|French]] and the first overtly national cultural movement in [[Laos]], which was in the odd position of having limited [[French people|French]] support.  Charles Rochet the French Director of Public Education in [[Vientiane]], and Lao intellectuals led by Nyuy Aphai and [[Katay Don Sasorith]] began the Movement for National Renovation.\n\nYet the wider impact of [[World War II]] had little effect on [[Laos]] until February 1945, when a detachment from the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] moved into [[Xieng Khouang Province|Xieng Khouang]].  The [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] preempted that the [[Vichy government|Vichy]] administration of [[French Indochina]] under Admiral Decoux would be replaced by a representative of the [[Free French]] loyal to [[Charles DeGaulle]] and initiated [[Japanese coup d'\u00e9tat in French Indochina|Operation Meigo]] (\"bright moon\").  The [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] succeeded in the [[internment]] of the [[French people|French]] living in [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]], but in the remote areas of [[Laos]] the [[French colonial empire|French]] were able with the help of the [[Lao people|Lao]] and ''Garde Indigene'' to establish jungle bases which were supplied by [[British Empire|British]] airdrops from [[Burma]]. However, [[French colonial empire|French]] control in [[Laos]] had been sidelined.<ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n===Lao Issara and Independence===\n1945 was a watershed year in the history of [[Laos]], under Japanese pressure King [[Sisavangvong]] declared independence in April. The move allowed the various independence movements in [[Laos]] including the Lao Seri and Lao Pen Lao to coalesce into the [[Lao Issara]] or \u201cFree Lao\u201d movement which was led by Prince [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa|Phetsarath]] and opposed the return of [[Laos]] to the [[French Protectorate of Laos|French]]. The [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] surrender on 15 August 1945 emboldened pro-French factions and Prince [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa|Phetsarath]] was dismissed by King [[Sisavangvong]]. Undeterred Prince [[Phetsarath Ratanavongsa|Phetsarath]] staged a coup in September and placed the royal family in [[Luang Prabang]] under house arrest. On 12 October 1945 the [[Lao Issara]] government was declared under the civil administration of Prince [[Phetsarath]].  In the next six months the [[French colonial empire|French]] rallied against the [[Lao Issara]] and were able to reassert control over [[French Indochina in World War II|Indochina]] in April 1946.  The [[Lao Issara]] government fled to [[Thailand]], where they maintained opposition to the [[French colonial empire|French]] until 1949, when the group split over questions regarding relations with the [[Vietminh]] and the [[communist]] [[Pathet Lao]] was formed.  With the [[Lao Issara]] in exile, in August 1946 France instituted a [[constitutional monarchy]] in [[Laos]] headed by King [[Sisavangvong]], and [[Thailand]] agreed to return territories seized during the [[Franco-Thai War]] in exchange for a representation at the [[United Nations]].  The Franco-Lao General Convention of 1949 provided most members of the [[Lao Issara]] with a negotiated amnesty and sought appeasement by establishing the [[Kingdom of Laos]] a quasi-independent constitutional monarchy within the [[French Union]]. In 1950 additional powers were granted to the [[Royal Lao Government]] including training and assistance for a national army. On October 22, 1953, the Franco\u2013Lao Treaty of Amity and Association transferred remaining French powers to the independent [[Royal Lao Government]]. By 1954 the defeat at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|Dien Bien Phu]] brought eight years of fighting with the [[Vietminh]], during the [[First Indochinese War]], to an end and [[France]] abandoned all claims to the colonies of [[French Indochina|Indochina]].<ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n==The Kingdom of Laos and the Lao Civil War (1953\u20131975)==\n{{main|Kingdom of Laos|Laotian Civil War|History of Laos since 1945}}\n\nElections were held in 1955, and the first coalition government, led by Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]], was formed in 1957. The coalition government collapsed in 1958. In 1960 Captain [[Kong Le]] staged a coup when the cabinet was away at the royal capital of Luang Prabang and demanded reformation of a neutralist government. The second coalition government, once again led by Souvanna Phouma, was not successful in holding power. Rightist forces under General [[Phoumi Nosavan]] drove out the neutralist government from power later that same year. The North Vietnamese invaded Laos between 1958\u20131959 to create the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]].\n\nA second Geneva conference, held in 1961\u201362, provided for the independence and [[International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos|neutrality of Laos]], but the agreement meant little in reality and the war soon resumed. Growing North Vietnamese military presence in the country increasingly drew Laos into the [[Second Indochina War]] (1954\u20131975). As a result, for nearly a decade, eastern Laos was subjected to some of the heaviest bombing in the history of warfare [https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-12-11-laos-bombs_x.htm], as the U.S. sought to destroy the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] that passed through Laos and defeat the Communist forces. The North Vietnamese also heavily backed the [[Pathet Lao]] and repeatedly invaded Laos. The government and army of Laos were backed by the USA during the conflict. The United States trained both regular Royal Lao forces and irregular forces among whom many were the Hmong and other ethnic minorities.\n\nShortly after the [[Paris Peace Accords]] led to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam, a ceasefire between the Pathet Lao and the government led to a new coalition government. However, North Vietnam never withdrew from Laos and the Pathet Lao remained little more than a proxy army for Vietnamese interests. After the fall of South Vietnam to communist forces in April 1975, the Pathet Lao with the backing of North Vietnam were able to take [[Taking of Vientiane|total power with little resistance]]. On December 2, 1975, the king was forced to abdicate his throne and the Lao People's Democratic Republic was established. Around 300,000 people out of a total population of 3 million left Laos by crossing the border into Thailand following the end of the civil war.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Courtois|first1=Stephane|last2=Werth|first2=Nicolas|last3=Panne|first3=Jean-Louis|last4=Paczkowski|first4=Andrzej|last5=Bartosek|first5=Karel|last6=Margolin|first6=Jean-Louis|displayauthors=1|title=The Black Book of Communism|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-674-07608-2|page=575|title-link=The Black Book of Communism}}</ref><ref name=\"Manich\"/>\n\n==The Lao People's Democratic Republic (1975\u2013present)==\n{{main|History of Laos since 1945}}\nThe new communist government led by [[Kaysone Phomvihane]] imposed centralized economic decision-making and incarcerated many members of the previous government and military in \"re-education camps\" which also included the Hmongs.

Laos depended heavily on Soviet aid channeled through Vietnam up until the Soviet collapse in 1991. In the 1990s the communist party gave up centralised management of the economy but still has a monopoly of political power.<ref name=\"Manich\"/><ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.murdoch.edu.au/Research-capabilities/Asia-Research-Centre/_document/working-papers/wp126.pdf |title = Politics and Reform in the Lao People's Democratic Republic)  |author = Martin Stuart-Fox |date =  |accessdate = December 29, 2017 |publisher = University of Queensland }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n== References ==\n'''Citations'''\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Works cited'''\n{{refbegin|indent=yes|30em}}\n* {{citation\n  | title = A History of Ayutthaya\n  | first1 = Chris | last1 = Baker | first2 = Pasuk | last2 = Phongpaichit\n  | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2017 | isbn = 978-1-107-19076-4\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GHiuDgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q&f=false\n  | postscript = .\n  }}\n* {{citation\n  | title = From Yue To Tai\n  | first = Chris | last = Baker\n  | journal = Journal of the Siam Society |volume=90 |issue=1\u20132 | year = 2002 | pages = 1\u201326\n  | url = http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/2001/JSS_090_0b_Baker_YueToThai.pdf\n  | postscript = .\n  }}\n* {{citation\n  | title =  The Birth of Vietnam\n  | given1 = Keith W. | surname1 = Taylor\n  | publisher = University of California Press\n  | url = https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=rCl_02LnNVIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false\n  | year = 1991\n  | isbn = 978-0-520-07417-0\n  | postscript = .\n  }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gunn, Geoffrey C.
