By the 7th century, Dunbar Castle was a central defensive position of the [[Kingdom of Bernicia|Kings of Bernicia]], an [[Angles|Anglian]] kingdom that took over from the British Kingdom of [[Bryneich]].\n\n===Northumbria===\nDuring the [[Early Middle Ages]], Dunbar Castle was held by an [[Ealdorman]] owing homage to either the Kings at [[Bamburgh Castle]], or latterly the [[Kingdom of York|Kings of York]]. In 678 [[Wilfrid|Saint Wilfrid]] was imprisoned at Dunbar, following his expulsion from his see of [[York]] by [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria]].\n\nLater, Dunbar was said to have been burnt by [[Kenneth MacAlpin]], King of the Scots. Certainly he is on record in possession of the castle.<ref name=dunbar8>Miller, James, ''The History of Dunbar'', Dunbar, 1830:8</ref>\n\n===Kingdom of the Scots===\nIn the 10th and early 11th centuries, the Norsemen made increasing inroads in Scotland and in 1005 a record exists of a Patrick de Dunbar, under [[Malcolm II]], engaged against the Norse invaders in the north at [[Dufftown|Murthlake]] a town of [[Marr]] where alongside Kenneth, [[Thane]] of the Isles, and Grim, Thane of [[Strathearn]], he was slain.<ref name=dunbar8/>\n\nThe first stone castle is thought to have been built by [[Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria]], after his exile from [[Kingdom of England|England]], following the [[Harrowing of the North]], by [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] after Gospatric took refuge at the court of [[Malcolm III of Scotland]]. Gospatric was a powerful landowner in both kingdoms and could summon many men, which encouraged Malcolm to give him more lands in [[East Lothian]], the [[Merse (Scotland)|Merse]] and [[Lauderdale]], as recompense for those lost further south and in return for loyalty as is usual under the feudal system. [[Sir Walter Scott]] argued that Cospatric or Gospatrick was a contraction of ''Comes Patricius''. In any case, King [[Malcolm III]] is recorded as bestowing the manor of Dunbar &c., on \"the expatriated Earl of Northumberland\".<ref name=dunbar8/>\n\n==Structure==\nThe body of buildings measured in excess of one hundred and sixty five feet from east to west, and in some places up to two hundred and ten feet from north to south. The South Battery, which Grose supposes to have been the citadel or [[keep]], is situated on a detached perpendicular rock, only accessible on one side, seventy two feet high, and is connected to the main part of the castle by a passage of masonry measuring sixty nine feet. The interior of the [[citadel]] measures fifty four feet by sixty within the walls. Its shape is octagonal. Five of the gun-ports remain, which are called the 'arrow-holes'. They measure four feet at the mouth and only sixteen inches at the other end. The buildings are arched and extend eight feet from the outer walls, and look into an open court, whence they derive their light.<ref name=dunbar2>Miller, James, ''The History of Dunbar'', Dunbar, 1830, pps 2 \u2013 6</ref>\n\n[[File:Dunbar Castle vignette engraving by William Miller after G F Sargent.jpg|thumb|left|250px|19th-century engraving of the castle]]\n\nAbout the middle of the fortress, part of a wall remains, through which there is a gateway, surmounted with armorial bearings. ths gate seems to have led to the principal apartments. In the centre, are the [[Coat of arms|arms]] of [[George I, Earl of March|George, 10th Earl of Dunbar]], who succeeded his father in 1369, and who besides the earldom of Dunbar and [[Earls of March|March]], inherited the Lordship of [[Annandale]] and the [[Isle of Man]] from his heroic aunt, [[Agnes Randolph|Black Agnes of Dunbar]]. They must have been placed there after his succession, as he was the first who assumed those sculptured Arms: viz, a large triangular shield, and thereon a lion ''rampant'', within a bordure charged with eight roses. The shield is adorned with a helmet, carrying a crest: a horse's head bridled. On the right are the Arms of the Bruces, and on the left those of the Isle of Man.<ref name=dunbar2/>\n\nThe castle towers had communication with the sea, and dip low in many places. North-east from the front of the castle is a large natural cavern, chiefly of black stone, which looks like the mouth of the [[Acheron]] \u2013 a place that leads to melancholy streams. This spot is supposed to have formed part of the dungeon where prisoners were confined, such as [[Gavin Douglas]], [[Bishop of Dunkeld]], who was a prisoner here in 1515. There is, however, also a dark postern which gives access to a rocky inlet from the sea, and it seems probable that it was through this that Sir Alexander Ramsay and his followers entered with a supply of provisions to the besieged in 1338.<ref name=dunbar2/>\n\nIt was long said the castle was invulnerable, possibly because of the many sieges it sustained. The castle was built with a red stone similar to that found in the quarries near [[Garvald, East Lothian|Garvald]]. Large masses of walls, which have fallen beneath the weight of time, appear to be vitrified or run together. In the north-west part of the ruins is an apartment about twelve feet square, and nearly inaccessible, which tradition states was the apartment of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].<ref name=dunbar2/>\n\n==Later history==\nThe Castle remained the stronghold of the [[Earl of Dunbar|Earls of Dunbar]] until the forfeiture of [[George II, Earl of March|George, Earl of March]], in 1457, when the Castle was dismantled to prevent its occupation by the English. It was restored by [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] later in the century.  The castle came under the control of the [[Duke of Albany]] and it was during this period that the bulwark to the west was built.  It may have been designed by [[Antoine d'Arces|Antoine d'Arces, Sieur de la Bastie]] who was placed in charge of the castle in December 1514.<ref name=Tabraham>Tabraham, Chris (1997) ''Scotland's Castles''.

He served as [[President of Germany|President of the Federal Republic of Germany]] ([[West Germany]]) from 1979 to 1984.\n\n==Early life and education==\nCarstens was born in the City of [[Bremen]], the son of a commercial school teacher, who had been killed at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] of [[World War I]] shortly before his birth. He studied law and political science at the universities of [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt]], [[University of Burgundy|Dijon]], [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]], [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg|K\u00f6nigsberg]], and [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg]] from 1933 to 1936, gaining a [[Doctor (title)|doctorate]] in 1938 and taking the Second ''[[Staatsexamen]]'' degree in 1939. In 1949 he also received a [[Master of Laws]] ([[LL.M.]]) degree from [[Yale Law School]].\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2008-0320, Karl Carstens, Veronica Carstens.jpg|thumb|right|Karl and Veronica Carstens in 1949]]\nFrom 1939 to 1945, during the [[Second World War]], Carstens was a member of an [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft artillery]] (''Flak'') unit in the [[Luftwaffe (Wehrmacht)|Luftwaffe]], reaching the rank of ''[[Leutnant]]'' (Second Lieutenant) by the war's end. In 1940 he joined the [[Nazi Party]]; reportedly, he had applied for admission in 1937 to avoid detrimental treatment when he worked as a [[law clerk]]. He had, however, joined the Nazi ''[[Sturmabteilung|SA]]'' paramilitary organisation already in 1934.\n\n==Post-war years==\nIn 1944 Carstens married the medical student [[Veronica Carstens|Veronica Prior]] in [[Berlin]]. After the war he became a [[lawyer]] in his hometown Bremen, and from 1949 acted as a councillor of the [[Senate of Bremen|city's Senate]]. From 1950 he also worked as lecturer at the [[University of Cologne]], where he habilitated two years later. In 1954 he joined the diplomatic service of the German [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]], serving as [[West Germany|West German]] representative at the [[Council of Europe]] in [[Strasbourg]]. In 1955 he joined the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) under Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]].\n\nIn July 1960 Carstens reached the position of [[secretary of state]] at the Foreign Office and in the same year was also appointed as professor for public and international law at Cologne University. During the [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] government of 1966-1969 under Chancellor [[Kurt Georg Kiesinger]], he first served as secretary of state in the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Ministry of Defence]], and after 1968 as head of the [[German Chancellery]].\n\nIn [[1972 West German federal election|1972]] Carstens was first elected into the [[Bundestag]], of which he was a member until 1979. From May 1973 until October 1976 he was chairman of the CDU/[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|CSU]] parliamentary group, succeeding [[Rainer Barzel]]. During that time he was an outspoken critic of left-wing tendencies in the [[German student movement]] and particular accused the governing [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) of being too soft on left-wing extremists. He also famously denounced the author and [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]] laureate [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll]] as a supporter of [[left-wing terrorism]] (specifically, the [[Red Army Faction|Baader-Meinhof Gang]]) for his 1974 novel ''[[The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum]]''.\n\nAfter the [[1976 West German federal election|1976 federal elections]], which made the CDU/CSU the largest group in parliament, Carstens was elected president of the Bundestag on 14 December 1976. The CDU/CSU had also reached a majority in the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] electing the [[President of Germany]], and in 1979 the party nominated Carstens, though in contestation due to his Nazi past, as candidate, whereafter incumbent President [[Walter Scheel]] ([[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]) chose to renounce a second term.\n\n==President of West Germany==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F057221-0004, Wanderung des Bundespr\u00e4sidenten Carstens.jpg|thumb|right|The hiking president, 1979]]\nOn 23 May 1979, Carstens was elected as the fifth President of the Federal Republic of Germany, prevailing against the SPD candidate [[Annemarie Renger]] in the first ballot. During his term of office, Carstens was well known for [[hiking]] Germany in order to decrease the gulf between politics and the people.\n\nIn December 1982, the new Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] (CDU), recently elected in a successful [[motion of no confidence]] against [[Helmut Schmidt]] (SPD) deliberately lost a vote of confidence in the Bundestag, in order to obtain a clearer majority in new general elections. Though already former Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] had similarly proceeded in 1972, this action gave rise to a discussion whether such a step constitutes a \"manipulation of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Constitution]]\". On 7 January 1983, President Carstens nonetheless dissolved the Bundestag and called for new elections. In February 1983 his decision was approved by the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] so that [[1983 West German federal election|1983 general elections]] could take place on 6 March.\n\nIn 1984 Carstens decided not to seek a second term on account of his age and left office on 30 June 1984.

The characters are listed in the order they were first credited in the series.\n\n===Carrie Mathison===\n{{Main article|Carrie Mathison}}\n\nPlayed by [[Claire Danes]], Carrie Mathison is a CIA officer who grapples with bipolar disorder.  While deployed in Iraq, Carrie receives information leading her to suspect rescued American [[prisoner of war|POW]] Nicholas Brody of being a terrorist.  During a lengthy unauthorized investigation into Brody, she becomes obsessed with him, and the two even have a brief romantic relationship.  Her suspicions ultimately being correct, she loses her job when her investigation is exposed by Brody.  Carrie successfully stops Brody's suicide bombing attempt but is unaware she was successful and is instead made to believe that Brody was innocent.    Now completely demoralized, she submits herself to electroconvulsive therapy as she is no longer confident in her skills.\n\nWhen Brody's confession video is discovered, Carrie is brought back into the CIA.   She successfully interrogates Brody, getting him to admit his complicity and to agree to work against al-Qaeda rather than be exposed to the world as treasonous.  Carrie acts as Brody's handler and their romance is eventually rekindled.   She is kidnapped by Abu Nazir on American soil but is instrumental in his subsequent capture and killing by FBI forces.  When Brody is framed by al-Qaeda as the perpetrator of the Langley bombing on 12/12, Carrie helps Brody flee to Canada and promises to clear his name.\n\n===Nicholas Brody===\n{{Main article|Nicholas Brody}}\n\nPlayed by [[Damian Lewis]], Nicholas Brody is the husband of Jessica Brody and father to Dana and Chris.  He is an ex-Marine who was captured by al-Qaeda and held as a [[prisoner of war|POW]] for eight years in Iraq.    Brody, after years of brutal treatment, becomes sympathetic to Abu Nazir's cause during his captivity and agrees to return to the United States as a sleeper agent.  Once back in the U.S., Brody has a turbulent relationship with his family, partly due to Jessica's having had an affair with Brody's best friend Mike.  Brody has an affair of his own with Carrie Mathison, the CIA officer who suspects him of working for al-Qaeda.  According to plan, Brody successfully gets himself into a bunker with the Vice President while wearing a suicide vest, intending to detonate it, but he aborts when Dana calls him, begging him to come home.   He leaves the scene with nobody being the wiser.\n\nBrody takes advantage of his public popularity, and support from Vice President Walden, to win a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]].   He continues to secretly work for Abu Nazir until he is discovered by the CIA.   Carrie, using her emotional connection with Brody, is able to convince him to turn against al-Qaeda.  Using Brody's inside information, a major al-Qaeda terrorist attack is thwarted by the CIA.  However, Brody is made to look like the perpetrator of a second bombing at CIA Headquarters on 12/12, making him the most wanted man in America.  He goes into hiding in Canada.\n\n===Jessica Brody===\nPlayed by [[Morena Baccarin]], Jessica Brody is the wife of Nicholas Brody and mother of Dana and Chris.

Nicholas and Jessica eventually come to a mutual agreement that their marriage cannot continue.\n\n===David Estes===\nPlayed by [[David Harewood]]. The director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center.   He has a tense relationship with Carrie, partly due to a past affair with her which led to the end of Estes' marriage.  He fires Carrie upon learning of her bipolar disorder and her multiple contraventions of CIA protocols, but later on, he must reinstate her when she is proven to have been right about Brody.  Saul discovers that Estes and then-CIA-director Walden ordered a drone strike launched in Abu Nazir's homeland, resulting in the destruction of a nearby school and that his efforts to undermine Carrie were actually an attempt to cover up the incident.  Estes makes plans to have Brody assassinated once Abu Nazir is neutralized, and when Saul opposes this action, he threatens Saul's job.   He is among those killed when a bomb explodes at the CIA building.\n\n===Mike Faber===\nPlayed by [[Diego Klattenhoff]], Mike Faber is Nick Brody's best friend\u2014they served in the Marines together.

The Brody family still comes to depend on Mike when they are neglected by Nicholas.  Mike and a fellow Marine, Lauder Wakefield, feel that Brody may have had something to do with the murder of Tom Walker and investigate the matter. He eventually confronts Jessica with his theories.\n\n===Chris Brody===\nPlayed by [[Jackson Pace]], Chris Brody is the son of Nicholas and Jessica and younger brother to Dana.  Chris is too young to remember Nicholas before he went into service, and struggles to connect with his returned father at times.  When his father's behavior becomes more erratic, Chris finds comfort in the familiar presence of Mike Faber.\n\n===Dana Brody===\nPlayed by [[Morgan Saylor]], Dana Brody is the daughter of Nicholas and Jessica and older sister to Chris. Intelligent and strong-minded, Dana is the member of the family with whom Brody feels most comfortable after his return home.  She is the only one to whom Brody freely admits his conversion to the Muslim faith.  Dana exhibits some resentment towards her mother for having had an affair with Mike.  When Brody is about to detonate his suicide vest at the State Department, Carrie convinces Dana to call him and \"talk him down\", which convinces Brody to not go through with the attack, though Dana is left not having any clue what Brody was planning to do.\n\nWhile she is on a date with her boyfriend Finn Walden, Finn is driving recklessly, fatally strikes a pedestrian, then drives away.  Dana is overcome with guilt.  Her relationship with her father deteriorates when she wants to report the accident to the police, but her father doesn't allow it (his hand is forced by the CIA), much to her disillusionment.\n\nWhen she watches the news showing that her father was turned in Afghanistan, Dana attempts suicide and is eventually placed in a psychiatric hospital, where she meets Leo Carras. The two begin a relationship and eventually run off together until Dana learns that Leo was possibly involved in the death of his own brother, which Leo told her was a suicide. After this, Dana changes her last name to disassociate herself from her father and moves out of the house. Psychologically ruined and disillusioned, she ends up cleaning motel rooms, seeing Brody one final time before he goes to Iran. Her father tries to reconnect with her, but Dana rejects him and claims to never want to see him again.\n\n===Saul Berenson===\nPlayed by [[Mandy Patinkin]], Saul Berenson is [[Middle East]] Division Chief of the CIA.  Saul recruited a young Carrie Mathison into the CIA, and is a friend and mentor to her.  His measured approach to his job often clashes with Carrie's drastic, impulsive methods.\n\nSaul is instrumental in getting cooperation from captured terrorist Aileen Morgan, which leads to information that implicates Tom Walker.  Saul later runs afoul of CIA Director Estes when he discovers that Estes and then-CIA director William Walden ordered a drone strike that hit a school in Iraq and have been taking measures to cover up the incident.  After an operation with Carrie in Beirut, Saul finds a copy of the confession tape that Brody recorded.   This leads to Saul, Carrie, and Estes forming a task force attempting to use Brody as a re-doubled agent against al-Qaeda.  Saul discovers that Estes' plan is to have Brody killed once the operation is finished and tries to put a stop to it which leads to further friction with Estes, almost losing his job. However, Peter Quinn, the black ops operative hired by Estes to kill Brody, decides not to go through with the plan once Abu Nazir is killed. When Estes is killed at the bombing of the memorial service for William Walden at Langley on December 12, Saul becomes the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|acting director of the CIA]].\n\nOnce he is director, Saul and Carrie almost immediately put into action a plan to lure out the mastermind behind the 12/12 attacks in which Carrie is outed to the press as having bipolar disorder and having had an affair with Brody. Appearing vulnerable, Carrie is contacted by representatives of an international bank with ties to the middle east, as Saul predicted, who ask her to inform on CIA operations to their client, Majid Javadi, Iran intelligence Chief and the orchestrator of the 12/12 attack who Saul has a troubled history with. When they were both getting their starts in their respective nations, Saul and Javadi worked together during the Iranian hostage crisis, but Javadi betrayed Saul by having several hostages who Saul was going to extradite back to the states killed. In response, Saul helped Javadi's wife and son escape to America. Saul, with the help of Fara Sherazi, finds that Javadi embezzled millions from his own nation to fund the attack, making him an enemy of the Iranian state should this ever be revealed. Using this as leverage to make Javadi a CIA asset, Saul sends Javadi back to Iran. At the same time, Saul clashes with Senator Andrew Lockhart, who is soon to replace him as director, and he discovers that his wife is having an affair with a man named Alan Bernard.\n\nSaul manages to bring Brody, now a heroin addict after his captivity in Caracas, back to the United States before revealing the entirety of his master plan to Carrie. He intends to send Brody to Iran where he will tell the government that he wishes for asylum there. Once in Tehran, Brody is to kill Danesh Akbari, leader of the Revolutionary Guard, who will be replaced by Javadi, ushering in a regime change in the nation. Brody is brought back to health, overcoming his addiction and training with several members of a special ops unit in preparation of the assignment. Meanwhile, Saul finds that Alan is an Israeli intelligence agent hired by Lockhart to spy on him, and Saul uses this info to give himself more time in office to see through the mission to the plan. Brody manages to make it into Tehran, where his first attempt to kill Akbari fails, forcing Brody to keep his cover until another opportunity arises, though this makes Lockhart and Dar Adal believe that Brody has no intention to go through with the mission. However, Brody arranges a meeting with Akbari, and kills him in his office before fleeing. Carrie takes him to a safe house, but Lockhart gives Brody up to the Iranians in order to ensure Javadi's public image. Brody is executed in Tehran, but despite this, Saul's plan is a success. He is fired from the CIA once Lockhart takes office, and then begins work in the private sector.\n\n===William Walden===\nPlayed by [[Jamey Sheridan]], William Walden was the [[Vice President of the United States]] and a former director of the CIA. Both Brody and Abu Nazir hold him accountable for the drone strike that killed Nazir's son Issa. He is killed during a meeting with Brody when Nazir's associates tamper with his pacemaker.

Walden attended the [[University of Notre Dame]] and was an All-American football player there.\n\n===Virgil Piotrowski===\nPlayed by [[David Marciano]], Virgil Piotrowski is a freelance surveillance expert and former CIA employee.  He is one of Carrie's few friends.

Nazir oversees the captivity of prisoners of war Nicholas Brody and Tom Walker, and over a period of years is able to persuade them both to turn on the U.S. and align with al-Qaeda.  Issa, Nazir's son, is killed by a CIA-sanctioned drone strike.   The incident is pivotal in shifting the allegiance of Brody, and also leads Nazir to swear revenge on the CIA and its director.   He sends Brody and Walker back to the U.S. with a plot to kill Walden and many other officials but it is thwarted by the efforts of Carrie Mathison.\n\nBrody is captured by the CIA and forced to work with them against al-Qaeda.  Nazir infiltrates the United States himself with a new plan.   First, he orchestrates the assassination of Vice President Walden, forcing Brody to assist by holding Carrie as a hostage.  He then sacrifices himself (killed by SWAT team), along with his [[Clandestine cell system|cell]] (captured by CIA forces), in order to give the appearance that the terror threat has been neutralized.  However, Nazir had planted a bomb in Brody's car, and one of his associates detonates the bomb at the CIA's headquarters, killing 219 people and wiping out much of the CIA's infrastructure, and setting up the innocent Brody as the culprit.\n\n===Peter Quinn===\nPlayed by [[Rupert Friend]], Peter Quinn is originally introduced as a CIA analyst brought in by Estes to head up the Brody task force.   He clashes with Carrie as she is not very willing to take orders from him, but they come to respect each other's skills.  Quinn is later revealed by Saul to be a black ops officer hired by Estes to assassinate Brody once Abu Nazir is neutralized.  He ends up refusing to kill Brody, realizing that carrying out the job would only be advancing Estes' interests, and knowing the effect it would have on Carrie.\n\nQuinn was later assigned to the CIA station in Islamabad, and saw action during the hunt for Saul Berenson and Haissam Haqqani's assault on the US embassy, where his actions saved the lives of many Americans. After Haqqani escaped, the US made the decision to break off ties with Pakistan and the embassy was evacuated; despite orders to evacuate, Quinn remained in Islamabad and tracked Haqqani to a heavily guarded apartment complex in Islamabad and was going to explode a pipe bomb under Haqquani's car but Carrie got in the way so he had to call it off.\n\nIn Berlin, Quinn was initially assigned to investigate a leak of classified documents dealing with cooperation between the CIA and German intelligence. Saul later recruited him for an off-the-books operation to target ISIS terrorists in Berlin, an operation that was complicated when Carrie's name ended up on his list. Quinn later rescued from an ambush by assailants that turn out to be Russian intelligence officers. He later infiltrated the ISIS cell (led by Hajik Zayd, a convicted jihadist released after the journalist Laura Sutton revealed that he was illegally put under surveillance and imprisoned by the German Bundesnachrichtendienst) and discovered their plan to use chemical weapons in Berlin. He attempts to convince them to stop the attack, but the ISIS recruits decide to use him as the test subject for their chemical weapon. One of the terorists gets qualms about the operation and injects Quinn with an antidote. The rest of the ISIS recruits make their way to the Berlin train station; Carrie is able to intercept Qasim and convince him to desist. When his partner Bibi kills Qasim, Carrie shoots and kills him. Quinn is later hospitalized and suffers a massive brain hemorrhage, leaving little chance for survival.\n\nHaving returned to the US, Quinn was treated for PTSD at a hospital in Brooklyn. He rejected any help from Carrie, who was told by the medical staff that it was probably better if she did not visit him. However, he later left the facility and ended up in the company of prostitutes and high on drugs. He was robbed of his government check and after Carrie was notified that he was missing she located him and attempted to return him to the hospital, he violently resisted it and she decided to let him move into the apartment downstairs from her and Frannie. He soon became convinced that a person who lived across from Carrie was spying on the house but his attempts to tell Carrie fell on deaf ears. Following Sekou Bah's death, the press convened on Carrie's house while she was out, leaving Frannie in his care, and he tried to protect Frannie and her nanny, which led to a shoot out between him and the authorities. They eventually managed to take him into custody and Frannie was soon taken away by social services, who felt that Quinn's actions had put her in danger.\n\nQuinn managed to drive to a diner near Queens where he met with an old friend before arriving at a suburban house, which he had known from his days working as a Black Ops agent. He called Carrie to meet them but the man who had killed Astrid tracked them down and Quinn killed him via multiple blows to the face. Carrie later found another van in the garage similar to the one Sekou was driving when he died and they soon realized the house was rigged with a bomb. She and Quinn survived the blast while other agents were killed. Carrie and Quinn went to Brooklyn to talk with President-elect Keane and it was discovered that there was a bomb in the hotel. Quinn managed to get them to safety but was killed in a hail of bullets.\n\n===Mira Berenson===\nPlayed by [[Sarita Choudhury]]. Mira is the wife (later ex-wife) of Saul Berenson. She leaves Saul to move to New Delhi, but she returns to the U.S. after the CIA bombing.

After breaking it off with Alain, she recommits to her marriage to Saul, which continues after his tenure at the CIA ends and he begins work in the private sector. However, after Saul rejoins the CIA, Mira files for divorce.

He is the handler of Peter Quinn, who is lent to David Estes to terminate Nicholas Brody. After the 12/12 bombing, Saul, in his remaining time as director of the CIA, keeps Dar Adal as a close ally, helping him during the course of Saul's plan to instigate a regime change in Iran. Dar Adal grows to great prominence during season three. Dar has Carrie detained and is primarily responsible for keeping her locked up in a psychiatric facility. He was also behind the operation to kill or capture the Langley bomber, who was still residing in the United States. Carrie wanted to ensure the survival of the perpetrator to exonerate her beloved Brody, who had been blamed for the 12/12 bombing and nearly compromised the mission. Dar gave the order to Quinn to have Carrie shot in order to prevent the mission's failure, which landed Carrie back in the hospital. Later in the season, Brody is brought back to the United States from Venezuela and experiences heroin withdrawals. Saul only has six days before Lockhart is confirmed as the new director of the CIA and must get Brody back to full recovery to implement his regime change plan. Dar recommends they use [[ibogaine]], a drug that speeds up the withdrawal process while also causing violent and severe hallucinations. In the season finale, Saul promised Carrie that he would have her and Brody extracted from Iran immediately after Brody completed his objectives. However, Javadi believed that the capture and execution of Brody would give further credence to the plot. Unbeknownst to Saul, Dar informs Lockhart and gets approval from the president to take command of the CIA 11 hours before he is to be confirmed.

The characters are listed in the order they were first credited in the series.\n\n===Carrie Mathison===\n{{Main article|Carrie Mathison}}\n\nPlayed by [[Claire Danes]], Carrie Mathison is a CIA officer who grapples with bipolar disorder.  While deployed in Iraq, Carrie receives information leading her to suspect rescued American [[prisoner of war|POW]] Nicholas Brody of being a terrorist.  During a lengthy unauthorized investigation into Brody, she becomes obsessed with him, and the two even have a brief romantic relationship.  Her suspicions ultimately being correct, she loses her job when her investigation is exposed by Brody.  Carrie successfully stops Brody's suicide bombing attempt but is unaware she was successful and is instead made to believe that Brody was innocent.    Now completely demoralized, she submits herself to electroconvulsive therapy as she is no longer confident in her skills.\n\nWhen Brody's confession video is discovered, Carrie is brought back into the CIA.   She successfully interrogates Brody, getting him to admit his complicity and to agree to work against al-Qaeda rather than be exposed to the world as treasonous.  Carrie acts as Brody's handler and their romance is eventually rekindled.   She is kidnapped by Abu Nazir on American soil but is instrumental in his subsequent capture and killing by FBI forces.  When Brody is framed by al-Qaeda as the perpetrator of the Langley bombing on 12/12, Carrie helps Brody flee to Canada and promises to clear his name.\n\n===Nicholas Brody===\n{{Main article|Nicholas Brody}}\n\nPlayed by [[Damian Lewis]], Nicholas Brody is the husband of Jessica Brody and father to Dana and Chris.  He is an ex-Marine who was captured by al-Qaeda and held as a [[prisoner of war|POW]] for eight years in Iraq.    Brody, after years of brutal treatment, becomes sympathetic to Abu Nazir's cause during his captivity and agrees to return to the United States as a sleeper agent.  Once back in the U.S., Brody has a turbulent relationship with his family, partly due to Jessica's having had an affair with Brody's best friend Mike.  Brody has an affair of his own with Carrie Mathison, the CIA officer who suspects him of working for al-Qaeda.  According to plan, Brody successfully gets himself into a bunker with the Vice President while wearing a suicide vest, intending to detonate it, but he aborts when Dana calls him, begging him to come home.   He leaves the scene with nobody being the wiser.\n\nBrody takes advantage of his public popularity, and support from Vice President Walden, to win a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]].   He continues to secretly work for Abu Nazir until he is discovered by the CIA.   Carrie, using her emotional connection with Brody, is able to convince him to turn against al-Qaeda.  Using Brody's inside information, a major al-Qaeda terrorist attack is thwarted by the CIA.  However, Brody is made to look like the perpetrator of a second bombing at CIA Headquarters on 12/12, making him the most wanted man in America.  He goes into hiding in Canada.\n\n===Jessica Brody===\nPlayed by [[Morena Baccarin]], Jessica Brody is the wife of Nicholas Brody and mother of Dana and Chris.   In the eight years her husband is gone and presumed dead, Jessica does not remarry but does engage in a serious relationship with Brody's best friend Mike Faber, which is abruptly ended when Brody returns home.  The reunited couple struggle with their marriage. He resents Jessica's relationship with Mike.  Jessica, in turn, learns of Brody's affair with Carrie.  As his behavior becomes increasingly bizarre, Jessica suspects further infidelity. When Brody is off on a CIA-sanctioned mission, Jessica and Mike's relationship is rekindled; Jessica and Mike had fallen in love. Nicholas and Jessica eventually come to a mutual agreement that their marriage cannot continue.\n\n===David Estes===\nPlayed by [[David Harewood]]. The director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center.   He has a tense relationship with Carrie, partly due to a past affair with her which led to the end of Estes' marriage.  He fires Carrie upon learning of her bipolar disorder and her multiple contraventions of CIA protocols, but later on, he must reinstate her when she is proven to have been right about Brody.  Saul discovers that Estes and then-CIA-director Walden ordered a drone strike launched in Abu Nazir's homeland, resulting in the destruction of a nearby school and that his efforts to undermine Carrie were actually an attempt to cover up the incident.  Estes makes plans to have Brody assassinated once Abu Nazir is neutralized, and when Saul opposes this action, he threatens Saul's job.   He is among those killed when a bomb explodes at the CIA building.\n\n===Mike Faber===\nPlayed by [[Diego Klattenhoff]], Mike Faber is Nick Brody's best friend\u2014they served in the Marines together.  While Brody is being held as a prisoner-of-war, he is presumed to be dead.  Mike gets involved in a long-term relationship with Nick's wife Jessica, becoming very attached to her and the Brody family.  The relationship is abruptly ended when Brody returns.  The Brody family still comes to depend on Mike when they are neglected by Nicholas.  Mike and a fellow Marine, Lauder Wakefield, feel that Brody may have had something to do with the murder of Tom Walker and investigate the matter. He eventually confronts Jessica with his theories.\n\n===Chris Brody===\nPlayed by [[Jackson Pace]], Chris Brody is the son of Nicholas and Jessica and younger brother to Dana.  Chris is too young to remember Nicholas before he went into service, and struggles to connect with his returned father at times.  When his father's behavior becomes more erratic, Chris finds comfort in the familiar presence of Mike Faber.\n\n===Dana Brody===\nPlayed by [[Morgan Saylor]], Dana Brody is the daughter of Nicholas and Jessica and older sister to Chris. Intelligent and strong-minded, Dana is the member of the family with whom Brody feels most comfortable after his return home.  She is the only one to whom Brody freely admits his conversion to the Muslim faith.  Dana exhibits some resentment towards her mother for having had an affair with Mike.  When Brody is about to detonate his suicide vest at the State Department, Carrie convinces Dana to call him and \"talk him down\", which convinces Brody to not go through with the attack, though Dana is left not having any clue what Brody was planning to do.\n\nWhile she is on a date with her boyfriend Finn Walden, Finn is driving recklessly, fatally strikes a pedestrian, then drives away.  Dana is overcome with guilt.  Her relationship with her father deteriorates when she wants to report the accident to the police, but her father doesn't allow it (his hand is forced by the CIA), much to her disillusionment.\n\nWhen she watches the news showing that her father was turned in Afghanistan, Dana attempts suicide and is eventually placed in a psychiatric hospital, where she meets Leo Carras. The two begin a relationship and eventually run off together until Dana learns that Leo was possibly involved in the death of his own brother, which Leo told her was a suicide. After this, Dana changes her last name to disassociate herself from her father and moves out of the house. Psychologically ruined and disillusioned, she ends up cleaning motel rooms, seeing Brody one final time before he goes to Iran. Her father tries to reconnect with her, but Dana rejects him and claims to never want to see him again.\n\n===Saul Berenson===\nPlayed by [[Mandy Patinkin]], Saul Berenson is [[Middle East]] Division Chief of the CIA.  Saul recruited a young Carrie Mathison into the CIA, and is a friend and mentor to her.  His measured approach to his job often clashes with Carrie's drastic, impulsive methods.\n\nSaul is instrumental in getting cooperation from captured terrorist Aileen Morgan, which leads to information that implicates Tom Walker.  Saul later runs afoul of CIA Director Estes when he discovers that Estes and then-CIA director William Walden ordered a drone strike that hit a school in Iraq and have been taking measures to cover up the incident.  After an operation with Carrie in Beirut, Saul finds a copy of the confession tape that Brody recorded.   This leads to Saul, Carrie, and Estes forming a task force attempting to use Brody as a re-doubled agent against al-Qaeda.  Saul discovers that Estes' plan is to have Brody killed once the operation is finished and tries to put a stop to it which leads to further friction with Estes, almost losing his job. However, Peter Quinn, the black ops operative hired by Estes to kill Brody, decides not to go through with the plan once Abu Nazir is killed. When Estes is killed at the bombing of the memorial service for William Walden at Langley on December 12, Saul becomes the [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|acting director of the CIA]].\n\nOnce he is director, Saul and Carrie almost immediately put into action a plan to lure out the mastermind behind the 12/12 attacks in which Carrie is outed to the press as having bipolar disorder and having had an affair with Brody. Appearing vulnerable, Carrie is contacted by representatives of an international bank with ties to the middle east, as Saul predicted, who ask her to inform on CIA operations to their client, Majid Javadi, Iran intelligence Chief and the orchestrator of the 12/12 attack who Saul has a troubled history with. When they were both getting their starts in their respective nations, Saul and Javadi worked together during the Iranian hostage crisis, but Javadi betrayed Saul by having several hostages who Saul was going to extradite back to the states killed. In response, Saul helped Javadi's wife and son escape to America. Saul, with the help of Fara Sherazi, finds that Javadi embezzled millions from his own nation to fund the attack, making him an enemy of the Iranian state should this ever be revealed. Using this as leverage to make Javadi a CIA asset, Saul sends Javadi back to Iran. At the same time, Saul clashes with Senator Andrew Lockhart, who is soon to replace him as director, and he discovers that his wife is having an affair with a man named Alan Bernard.\n\nSaul manages to bring Brody, now a heroin addict after his captivity in Caracas, back to the United States before revealing the entirety of his master plan to Carrie. He intends to send Brody to Iran where he will tell the government that he wishes for asylum there. Once in Tehran, Brody is to kill Danesh Akbari, leader of the Revolutionary Guard, who will be replaced by Javadi, ushering in a regime change in the nation. Brody is brought back to health, overcoming his addiction and training with several members of a special ops unit in preparation of the assignment. Meanwhile, Saul finds that Alan is an Israeli intelligence agent hired by Lockhart to spy on him, and Saul uses this info to give himself more time in office to see through the mission to the plan. Brody manages to make it into Tehran, where his first attempt to kill Akbari fails, forcing Brody to keep his cover until another opportunity arises, though this makes Lockhart and Dar Adal believe that Brody has no intention to go through with the mission. However, Brody arranges a meeting with Akbari, and kills him in his office before fleeing. Carrie takes him to a safe house, but Lockhart gives Brody up to the Iranians in order to ensure Javadi's public image. Brody is executed in Tehran, but despite this, Saul's plan is a success. He is fired from the CIA once Lockhart takes office, and then begins work in the private sector.\n\n===William Walden===\nPlayed by [[Jamey Sheridan]], William Walden was the [[Vice President of the United States]] and a former director of the CIA. Both Brody and Abu Nazir hold him accountable for the drone strike that killed Nazir's son Issa. He is killed during a meeting with Brody when Nazir's associates tamper with his pacemaker. Brody agreed to provide the pacemaker's serial number for Nazir in exchange for releasing Carrie as his hostage. Walden attended the [[University of Notre Dame]] and was an All-American football player there.\n\n===Virgil Piotrowski===\nPlayed by [[David Marciano]], Virgil Piotrowski is a freelance surveillance expert and former CIA employee.  He is one of Carrie's few friends.  Carrie sometimes enlists him to help her with surveillance operations.\n\n===Abu Nazir===\nPlayed by [[Navid Negahban]], Abu Nazir is a high-ranking operative, possibly the operational leader, of al-Qaeda.  Nazir oversees the captivity of prisoners of war Nicholas Brody and Tom Walker, and over a period of years is able to persuade them both to turn on the U.S. and align with al-Qaeda.  Issa, Nazir's son, is killed by a CIA-sanctioned drone strike.   The incident is pivotal in shifting the allegiance of Brody, and also leads Nazir to swear revenge on the CIA and its director.   He sends Brody and Walker back to the U.S. with a plot to kill Walden and many other officials but it is thwarted by the efforts of Carrie Mathison.\n\nBrody is captured by the CIA and forced to work with them against al-Qaeda.  Nazir infiltrates the United States himself with a new plan.   First, he orchestrates the assassination of Vice President Walden, forcing Brody to assist by holding Carrie as a hostage.  He then sacrifices himself (killed by SWAT team), along with his [[Clandestine cell system|cell]] (captured by CIA forces), in order to give the appearance that the terror threat has been neutralized.  However, Nazir had planted a bomb in Brody's car, and one of his associates detonates the bomb at the CIA's headquarters, killing 219 people and wiping out much of the CIA's infrastructure, and setting up the innocent Brody as the culprit.\n\n===Peter Quinn===\nPlayed by [[Rupert Friend]], Peter Quinn is originally introduced as a CIA analyst brought in by Estes to head up the Brody task force.   He clashes with Carrie as she is not very willing to take orders from him, but they come to respect each other's skills.  Quinn is later revealed by Saul to be a black ops officer hired by Estes to assassinate Brody once Abu Nazir is neutralized.  He ends up refusing to kill Brody, realizing that carrying out the job would only be advancing Estes' interests, and knowing the effect it would have on Carrie.\n\nQuinn was later assigned to the CIA station in Islamabad, and saw action during the hunt for Saul Berenson and Haissam Haqqani's assault on the US embassy, where his actions saved the lives of many Americans. After Haqqani escaped, the US made the decision to break off ties with Pakistan and the embassy was evacuated; despite orders to evacuate, Quinn remained in Islamabad and tracked Haqqani to a heavily guarded apartment complex in Islamabad and was going to explode a pipe bomb under Haqquani's car but Carrie got in the way so he had to call it off.\n\nIn Berlin, Quinn was initially assigned to investigate a leak of classified documents dealing with cooperation between the CIA and German intelligence. Saul later recruited him for an off-the-books operation to target ISIS terrorists in Berlin, an operation that was complicated when Carrie's name ended up on his list. Quinn later rescued from an ambush by assailants that turn out to be Russian intelligence officers. He later infiltrated the ISIS cell (led by Hajik Zayd, a convicted jihadist released after the journalist Laura Sutton revealed that he was illegally put under surveillance and imprisoned by the German Bundesnachrichtendienst) and discovered their plan to use chemical weapons in Berlin. He attempts to convince them to stop the attack, but the ISIS recruits decide to use him as the test subject for their chemical weapon. One of the terorists gets qualms about the operation and injects Quinn with an antidote. The rest of the ISIS recruits make their way to the Berlin train station; Carrie is able to intercept Qasim and convince him to desist. When his partner Bibi kills Qasim, Carrie shoots and kills him. Quinn is later hospitalized and suffers a massive brain hemorrhage, leaving little chance for survival.\n\nHaving returned to the US, Quinn was treated for PTSD at a hospital in Brooklyn. He rejected any help from Carrie, who was told by the medical staff that it was probably better if she did not visit him. However, he later left the facility and ended up in the company of prostitutes and high on drugs. He was robbed of his government check and after Carrie was notified that he was missing she located him and attempted to return him to the hospital, he violently resisted it and she decided to let him move into the apartment downstairs from her and Frannie. He soon became convinced that a person who lived across from Carrie was spying on the house but his attempts to tell Carrie fell on deaf ears. Following Sekou Bah's death, the press convened on Carrie's house while she was out, leaving Frannie in his care, and he tried to protect Frannie and her nanny, which led to a shoot out between him and the authorities. They eventually managed to take him into custody and Frannie was soon taken away by social services, who felt that Quinn's actions had put her in danger.\n\nQuinn managed to drive to a diner near Queens where he met with an old friend before arriving at a suburban house, which he had known from his days working as a Black Ops agent. He called Carrie to meet them but the man who had killed Astrid tracked them down and Quinn killed him via multiple blows to the face. Carrie later found another van in the garage similar to the one Sekou was driving when he died and they soon realized the house was rigged with a bomb. She and Quinn survived the blast while other agents were killed. Carrie and Quinn went to Brooklyn to talk with President-elect Keane and it was discovered that there was a bomb in the hotel. Quinn managed to get them to safety but was killed in a hail of bullets.\n\n===Mira Berenson===\nPlayed by [[Sarita Choudhury]]. Mira is the wife (later ex-wife) of Saul Berenson. She leaves Saul to move to New Delhi, but she returns to the U.S. after the CIA bombing. She stays at Saul's side throughout his tenure as acting director of the CIA, though she briefly begins a relationship with another man, Alain Bernard, who is later revealed spying on Saul, acting on behalf of Andrew Lockhart. After breaking it off with Alain, she recommits to her marriage to Saul, which continues after his tenure at the CIA ends and he begins work in the private sector. However, after Saul rejoins the CIA, Mira files for divorce. They meet again in New York, as Saul prepares to go into hiding; their conversation causes Saul to reconsider.\n\n===Andrew Lockhart===\nPlayed by [[Tracy Letts]].

Murray Abraham]]. He is a [[black operation|black ops]] specialist who had been a friend of Saul 18 years prior. He is the handler of Peter Quinn, who is lent to David Estes to terminate Nicholas Brody. After the 12/12 bombing, Saul, in his remaining time as director of the CIA, keeps Dar Adal as a close ally, helping him during the course of Saul's plan to instigate a regime change in Iran. Dar Adal grows to great prominence during season three. Dar has Carrie detained and is primarily responsible for keeping her locked up in a psychiatric facility. He was also behind the operation to kill or capture the Langley bomber, who was still residing in the United States. Carrie wanted to ensure the survival of the perpetrator to exonerate her beloved Brody, who had been blamed for the 12/12 bombing and nearly compromised the mission. Dar gave the order to Quinn to have Carrie shot in order to prevent the mission's failure, which landed Carrie back in the hospital. Later in the season, Brody is brought back to the United States from Venezuela and experiences heroin withdrawals. Saul only has six days before Lockhart is confirmed as the new director of the CIA and must get Brody back to full recovery to implement his regime change plan. Dar recommends they use [[ibogaine]], a drug that speeds up the withdrawal process while also causing violent and severe hallucinations. In the season finale, Saul promised Carrie that he would have her and Brody extracted from Iran immediately after Brody completed his objectives. However, Javadi believed that the capture and execution of Brody would give further credence to the plot. Unbeknownst to Saul, Dar informs Lockhart and gets approval from the president to take command of the CIA 11 hours before he is to be confirmed.
