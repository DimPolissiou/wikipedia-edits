The first of these migrations are believed to have taken place over five hundred years ago. These Iyers settled in Palakkad where they owned land and led an affluent existence till the enactment of the land reforms in the 1960s. They followed many Malayali practices include the practice of ''[[sambandham]]''.

In a study, information found a strong correlation between borderline personality disorder and history of sexual trauma. Research has found a significant link between cluster B personality disorders and family history as well. Having a parent or sibling with a personality disorder increases your risk for developing the disorder.

Shchedrin called the novel \"a wonderful thriller begging to be transformed into an opera\".<ref name=\"expat\" /> He commented further: \"It feels like a nostalgia for beauty; it is a symbol, really. ...

Humbert's jealousy, however, is not directed towards Lolita or her husband, but towards the [[Mephistopheles|Mephistophelian]] film director Quilty, who has used Lolita for porn films.

For example, treasure hunters try to find sunken [[shipwreck]]s and retrieve artifacts with market value. This industry is generally fueled by the market for antiquities.

Even where good quality archaeological research is carried out by archaeologists working with treasure hunters, concerns remain that treasure hunting, by definition, ignores the principle that in-situ preservation of cultural heritage should always be considered first, and that the sale of recovered artifacts breaks up the assemblage of cultural heritage material, resulting in a loss of opportunity to study the whole picture.   The counter argument is that professional salvors have the resources to fund archaeological research of sites that would otherwise be unrecorded, and be subject to destruction by looting or natural forces.\n\n[[Image:Heinrich Schliemann.jpg|thumb|upright|Treasure hunter [[Heinrich Schliemann]]]]\nThe early stages of the development of [[archaeology]] included a significant aspect of treasure hunting; [[Heinrich Schliemann]]'s excavations at [[Troy]], and later at [[Mycenae]], both turned up significant finds of [[gold]]en artifacts.

I do not mean this to be so. A whole new branch of archaeology, that of [[Mycenae]]an studies, was founded by [[Heinrich Schliemann]], who also had the courage to remember his dreams \u2026 It is right to dream, and it would be the worst kind of mistake on the part of the state to discourage the big dreams of men like Mr. Spence, and to let a project requiring that sort of enterprise fall into the hands of what Mr. Spence's friend terms \u2018some bloody historical society\u2019 which might lay the dead hand of unimaginative and stereotyped thinking on Mr. Spence's courage and ability.\u201d<ref>\"Salvage Versus Archaeology\" by Peter Throckmorton, ''The Historical Archaeology Forum'', 1969, Volume 4, Part 1, Part 2, p. 133</ref> In 1972, Spence and Throckmorton, along with three other men, were awarded the degree of Doctor of Marine Histories by the [[College of Marine Arts]] on July 16, 1972, becoming first people in the world to be awarded a doctorate for work in marine archaeology.<ref>Letter to E. Lee Spence from Kenneth Friedman, Executive Secretary, Sea Research Society, published in ''Sea Research Society Papers,'' 1972, Spence, Volume VI, p. 159</ref>\n\nMore recently, most serious treasure hunters have started working underwater, where modern technology allows access to wrecks containing valuables, which were previously inaccessible.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Macguire|first1=Eoghan|title=Why scouring sea for sunken treasures is big business|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/13/business/sunken-treasure-business/|accessdate=13 July 2016|agency=CNN|date=14 March 2012}}</ref> Starting with the [[Standard diving dress|diving suit]], and moving on through [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] and later to [[Remotely operated vehicle#Submersible ROVs|ROVs]], each new generation of technology has made more wrecks accessible.

[[Deep-sea exploration]] today is accomplished using Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (\"[[Scuba set|SCUBA]]\"), unmanned submersible vehicles, Remote Operating Vehicles (\"ROVs\"),  and exposure suits. Sound Navigation and Ranging (\"[[Sonar]]\") and magnetometers are used for detection of treasure.<ref name=\"Malkiel\"/> Hand tools, probes, screens, containers, shovels, metal detectors, and sifters are useful for land treasure hunting (Smith, 1971).  The Evinrude Aquanaut is a portable floating diving unit that feeds air directly to the divers without need of tanks on the divers.<ref name=\"Rieseberg\"/>\nIn diving, masks allow for improved vision, fins increase swimming speeds, safety vests provide lifesaving assistance, diver's flags alert others of a diver's location, wetsuits conserve body heat and also provide skin protection, weight belts offset buoyancy of rubber suits, knives prove useful as a tool, tanks supply air, and [[snorkeling|snorkels]] conserve energy.<ref name=\"Horner\"/>\n\n==Criticism==\nTreasure hunting is condemned by a growing number of nations, and [[UNESCO]] issued a charter for the protection of the underwater cultural heritage in 2001: the [[UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage]].

This act says that each Secretary of the Interior would have their own specific authority over different artifacts or locations based on their department. These artifacts and locations are as follows: Historic landmarks, historic monuments, objects of antiquity, objects of scientific value and historical value.  The Secretary of Agriculture has jurisdiction over artifacts and monuments found within the outer limits of forest reserves.  The secretary of War for any land that resides in or near a military reserve.  The lands that are controlled by the US Government will be supervised by the respective Secretary. Permits will not be granted to those trying to move or take any monument or artifact that can be preserved in its original place and remain an ancient monument. A permit will not be granted to someone \"whose eyes are bigger than their stomach.\" In other words, those trying to explore a vast amount of area with little help and the job seems to not be done within the time limit designated by the certain someone, that permit will not be granted. Each permit will be granted by the respective Secretaries that have jurisdiction over those certain sites. Also including to the permit just stated above you also need these following requirements: The name of the Institution making the request, how much time it will take, the date, the person in charge of the project, what type of project it is going to be, excavating, gathering or examining, and the museum where the artifact will be shown and preserved. Each permit will only be granted for 3 years or less.  An extension can be granted if progress is shown. Permits will not be in effect if work does not begin within six months of getting the permit.<ref name=\"Rieseberg\"/>\nIn the United States the federal Abandoned Shipwrecks Act, which asserts the federal government's ownership of abandoned United States water shipwrecks, was put into place in 1988. Any shipwreck that is embedded in submerged lands and/or in coralline formations protected by a State on submerged lands of a state is property of the government. The Abandoned Shipwrecks Act then transfers ownership to the appropriate State government. The Supreme Court upheld the Abandoned Shipwrecks Act constitutionality in 1998. In the US, the finder of a ship not abandoned could seek a salvage award.<ref name=\"Malkiel\"/>\nThe countries England, Wales, and Northern Ireland claim gold and silver finds that are more than three hundred years old for the crown by way of the Treasure Act of 1996. Any found treasure in these nations must be reported within fourteen days of uncovering.\nThe United States awards ownership to the landowner. If finds occur on federal land it can be considered a federal offense. Most of the United States prosecutes the unearthing of burial grounds.<ref name=\"Newman\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:McKee's Museum of Sunken Treasure, Treasure Harbor, Plantation Key, Florida.jpg|thumb|McKee's Museum of Sunken Treasure, Treasure Harbor, Plantation Key, Florida]]\n\nIn 1643 Captain William Phips salvaged one of the sunken Spanish treasure ships forty-four years after they were wrecked on Silver Shoals.  At the time, the salvages wreck was worth twelve million dollars.<ref name=\"Helm\"/>\nThe ''[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Atocha]]'' left Havana bound for Spain in 1622 and sank. Mel Fisher and his crew spent sixteen years searching for the treasure that was aboard the ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Atocha''. Three silver bars were found in 1973, five bronze cannons were found in 1975, and  in 1980 a wooden hull weighted down by ballast stones, iron cannonballs and artifacts of 17th-century Spain were found.<ref name=\"Mel\"/>\nThe S.S. ''Central America'' sank after running into a hurricane off the Carolina coast in 1857. In 1987 Thomas G. Thompson discovered the ship's location. A remotely operated vehicle surfaced more than forty million dollars in gold from the sunken ship.<ref name=\"Zabludovsky\"/>\nIn 1782 the British Frigate Grosvenor sank in Natal Bay, East Africa, carrying treasure cargo of 2,000 silver ingots, 720 gold ingots, and jewels including the fabulous \"golden peacocks\" from the throne of the Great Mogul, at Delhi, India. In 1952, British recovered almost one million dollars' worth of the $5.3 million loot and hid in Brazil to escape the British Government's tax.<ref name=\"Rieseberg\"/>\nThe liner ''Laurentic'' heading from Liverpool to Halifax in 1917 collided into a mine and sunk with gold worth five million British pounds.  Lieutenant Commander [[Guybon Chesney Castell Damant|G.C.C. Damant]] was appointed to salvage the ship by the Admiralty. Commander Damant aided by Dr. J.S. Haldane and A.Y. Cattoo discovered the cause and prevention of caisson disease (\"the bends\") allowing them to make deep dives. Over seven seasons, all but 25 gold bars were recovered by Damant and his crew.<ref name=\"Helm\"/>\nIn 1994, the [[Odyssey Marine Exploration]] business venture began. This publicly traded company searches for treasure. In 2002 England entered into an arrangement with Odyssey in finding a British warship carrying billions of dollars' worth of treasure. The ship sank in 1694 off the coast of [[Gibraltar]].<ref name=\"Malkiel\"/>\nIn 2009 Terry Herbert in Staffordshire field found Anglo-Saxon gold, silver, and garnet objects valued at over five million dollars.

A whole new branch of archaeology, that of [[Mycenae]]an studies, was founded by [[Heinrich Schliemann]], who also had the courage to remember his dreams \u2026 It is right to dream, and it would be the worst kind of mistake on the part of the state to discourage the big dreams of men like Mr. Spence, and to let a project requiring that sort of enterprise fall into the hands of what Mr. Spence's friend terms \u2018some bloody historical society\u2019 which might lay the dead hand of unimaginative and stereotyped thinking on Mr. Spence's courage and ability.\u201d<ref>\"Salvage Versus Archaeology\" by Peter Throckmorton, ''The Historical Archaeology Forum'', 1969, Volume 4, Part 1, Part 2, p. 133</ref> In 1972, Spence and Throckmorton, along with three other men, were awarded the degree of Doctor of Marine Histories by the [[College of Marine Arts]] on July 16, 1972, becoming first people in the world to be awarded a doctorate for work in marine archaeology.<ref>Letter to E. Lee Spence from Kenneth Friedman, Executive Secretary, Sea Research Society, published in ''Sea Research Society Papers,'' 1972, Spence, Volume VI, p. 159</ref>\n\nMore recently, most serious treasure hunters have started working underwater, where modern technology allows access to wrecks containing valuables, which were previously inaccessible.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Macguire|first1=Eoghan|title=Why scouring sea for sunken treasures is big business|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/03/13/business/sunken-treasure-business/|accessdate=13 July 2016|agency=CNN|date=14 March 2012}}</ref> Starting with the [[Standard diving dress|diving suit]], and moving on through [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] and later to [[Remotely operated vehicle#Submersible ROVs|ROVs]], each new generation of technology has made more wrecks accessible. Many of these wrecks have resulted in the [[treasure salvage]] of many fascinating artifacts from Spanish treasure fleets as well as many others.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berfield|first1=Susan|title=Odyssey and the Lost Spanish Treasure|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-07/odyssey-and-the-lost-spanish-treasure|accessdate=13 July 2016|agency=Bloomberg|date=7 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\nRubberised suits, weighted belts and shoes, and helmets are used for deep-sea diving.<ref name=\"Helm\"/> Diving bells, open helmets, [[atmospheric diving suits]] were used. [[Deep-sea exploration]] today is accomplished using Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (\"[[Scuba set|SCUBA]]\"), unmanned submersible vehicles, Remote Operating Vehicles (\"ROVs\"),  and exposure suits. Sound Navigation and Ranging (\"[[Sonar]]\") and magnetometers are used for detection of treasure.<ref name=\"Malkiel\"/> Hand tools, probes, screens, containers, shovels, metal detectors, and sifters are useful for land treasure hunting (Smith, 1971).  The Evinrude Aquanaut is a portable floating diving unit that feeds air directly to the divers without need of tanks on the divers.<ref name=\"Rieseberg\"/>\nIn diving, masks allow for improved vision, fins increase swimming speeds, safety vests provide lifesaving assistance, diver's flags alert others of a diver's location, wetsuits conserve body heat and also provide skin protection, weight belts offset buoyancy of rubber suits, knives prove useful as a tool, tanks supply air, and [[snorkeling|snorkels]] conserve energy.<ref name=\"Horner\"/>\n\n==Criticism==\nTreasure hunting is condemned by a growing number of nations, and [[UNESCO]] issued a charter for the protection of the underwater cultural heritage in 2001: the [[UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage]]. This convention is a legal instrument helping states parties to improve the protection of their underwater cultural heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/protection/ |title=Protection &#124; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization |publisher=Unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-11}}</ref> In 2013 the [[National Geographic Channel]] set off a firestorm of controversy with its reality show ''Diggers''. Professional archaeologists from the [[Society for Historical Archaeology]], the largest scholarly group concerned with the archaeology of the modern world (A.D. 1400\u2013present), roundly criticised the network for promoting the theft of cultural materials on public and private land.<ref>{{cite web|title=National Geographic\u2019s Diggers: is it better?|url=https://sha.org/blog/2013/02/national-geographics-diggers-is-it-better/|website=Society for Historical Archaeology|accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Legality==\nIn 1906, the Secretaries of the Interior of Agriculture and War made an act for the preservation of American Antiquities (ancient artifacts).  This act says that each Secretary of the Interior would have their own specific authority over different artifacts or locations based on their department. These artifacts and locations are as follows: Historic landmarks, historic monuments, objects of antiquity, objects of scientific value and historical value.  The Secretary of Agriculture has jurisdiction over artifacts and monuments found within the outer limits of forest reserves.  The secretary of War for any land that resides in or near a military reserve.  The lands that are controlled by the US Government will be supervised by the respective Secretary. Permits will not be granted to those trying to move or take any monument or artifact that can be preserved in its original place and remain an ancient monument. A permit will not be granted to someone \"whose eyes are bigger than their stomach.\" In other words, those trying to explore a vast amount of area with little help and the job seems to not be done within the time limit designated by the certain someone, that permit will not be granted. Each permit will be granted by the respective Secretaries that have jurisdiction over those certain sites. Also including to the permit just stated above you also need these following requirements: The name of the Institution making the request, how much time it will take, the date, the person in charge of the project, what type of project it is going to be, excavating, gathering or examining, and the museum where the artifact will be shown and preserved. Each permit will only be granted for 3 years or less.  An extension can be granted if progress is shown. Permits will not be in effect if work does not begin within six months of getting the permit.<ref name=\"Rieseberg\"/>\nIn the United States the federal Abandoned Shipwrecks Act, which asserts the federal government's ownership of abandoned United States water shipwrecks, was put into place in 1988. Any shipwreck that is embedded in submerged lands and/or in coralline formations protected by a State on submerged lands of a state is property of the government. The Abandoned Shipwrecks Act then transfers ownership to the appropriate State government. The Supreme Court upheld the Abandoned Shipwrecks Act constitutionality in 1998. In the US, the finder of a ship not abandoned could seek a salvage award.<ref name=\"Malkiel\"/>\nThe countries England, Wales, and Northern Ireland claim gold and silver finds that are more than three hundred years old for the crown by way of the Treasure Act of 1996. Any found treasure in these nations must be reported within fourteen days of uncovering.\nThe United States awards ownership to the landowner. If finds occur on federal land it can be considered a federal offense. Most of the United States prosecutes the unearthing of burial grounds.<ref name=\"Newman\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:McKee's Museum of Sunken Treasure, Treasure Harbor, Plantation Key, Florida.jpg|thumb|McKee's Museum of Sunken Treasure, Treasure Harbor, Plantation Key, Florida]]\n\nIn 1643 Captain William Phips salvaged one of the sunken Spanish treasure ships forty-four years after they were wrecked on Silver Shoals.  At the time, the salvages wreck was worth twelve million dollars.<ref name=\"Helm\"/>\nThe ''[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Atocha]]'' left Havana bound for Spain in 1622 and sank. Mel Fisher and his crew spent sixteen years searching for the treasure that was aboard the ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Atocha''. Three silver bars were found in 1973, five bronze cannons were found in 1975, and  in 1980 a wooden hull weighted down by ballast stones, iron cannonballs and artifacts of 17th-century Spain were found.<ref name=\"Mel\"/>\nThe S.S. ''Central America'' sank after running into a hurricane off the Carolina coast in 1857. In 1987 Thomas G. Thompson discovered the ship's location. A remotely operated vehicle surfaced more than forty million dollars in gold from the sunken ship.<ref name=\"Zabludovsky\"/>\nIn 1782 the British Frigate Grosvenor sank in Natal Bay, East Africa, carrying treasure cargo of 2,000 silver ingots, 720 gold ingots, and jewels including the fabulous \"golden peacocks\" from the throne of the Great Mogul, at Delhi, India. In 1952, British recovered almost one million dollars' worth of the $5.3 million loot and hid in Brazil to escape the British Government's tax.<ref name=\"Rieseberg\"/>\nThe liner ''Laurentic'' heading from Liverpool to Halifax in 1917 collided into a mine and sunk with gold worth five million British pounds.  Lieutenant Commander [[Guybon Chesney Castell Damant|G.C.C. Damant]] was appointed to salvage the ship by the Admiralty. Commander Damant aided by Dr. J.S. Haldane and A.Y. Cattoo discovered the cause and prevention of caisson disease (\"the bends\") allowing them to make deep dives. Over seven seasons, all but 25 gold bars were recovered by Damant and his crew.<ref name=\"Helm\"/>\nIn 1994, the [[Odyssey Marine Exploration]] business venture began. This publicly traded company searches for treasure. In 2002 England entered into an arrangement with Odyssey in finding a British warship carrying billions of dollars' worth of treasure. The ship sank in 1694 off the coast of [[Gibraltar]].<ref name=\"Malkiel\"/>\nIn 2009 Terry Herbert in Staffordshire field found Anglo-Saxon gold, silver, and garnet objects valued at over five million dollars. Also in 2009, David Booth found four gold torques from the first century B.C. in Stirling, Scotland.<ref name=\"Newman\"/>\n\n==Notable treasure hunters ==\n{{main article|List of treasure hunters}}\n* [[Capt.
