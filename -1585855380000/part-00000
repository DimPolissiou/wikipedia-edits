Written by [[Jerome Bixby]] and directed by [[Murray Golden]], it was first broadcast on February 14, 1969. \n\nIn the episode, the crew of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' encounters an immortal human.\n\nIts repeat broadcast, on September 2, 1969, was the last official telecast of the series to air on [[NBC]]. ''Star Trek'' would immediately appear in [[Television syndication|syndication]] on the following Monday, September 8, a full three years after its debut.\n\n==Plot==\nThe crew of the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship]]  ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|  Enterprise]]'' is struck with deadly Rigellian fever, for which the only treatment is the mineral ryetalyn. They arrive at planet Holberg 917-G in search of the substance. Captain [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]], first officer [[Spock]] and medical officer [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]] beam down and are attacked by an airborne robot, which is called off by its master, Flint. Flint orders them to leave immediately, but is finally moved by their plight.\n\nFlint gives the landing party two hours, offering the help of his sentry robot M4 to gather the mineral. Flint then escorts them to his home, which has an impressive art collection, including undiscovered paintings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Spock notices that the brushwork of the paintings is identical to Leonardo's, but his [[tricorder]] indicates that they are made with contemporary materials.\n\nThe party is introduced to Flint's beautiful young ward, Rayna Kapec, whose late parents, according to Flint, were employees of his. On Flint's suggestion, Kirk plays [[billiards]] with Rayna, and they dance to a [[waltz]] played on the piano by Spock. The sheet music, apparently in the hand of [[Johannes Brahms]], is written with contemporary ink. Shortly afterward, M4 returns with a container of ryetalyn, but it is contaminated with irilium, and therefore useless. Flint apologizes and accompanies M4 on a search for more ryetalyn.\n\nOddities begin to mount up. When Kirk kisses Rayna, M4 reacts as if he were attacking her. The ''Enterprise'' reports that no information can be found on Flint or Rayna. A tricorder scan reveals that Flint is over 6,000 years old. Finally, the processing of the new ryetalyn, supposedly being performed in Flint\u2019s laboratory, is taking a suspiciously long time.\n\nRayna comes to say goodbye to Kirk, who has fallen in love with her and begs her to accompany him. McCoy tells them that the ryetalyn is missing, and Spock follows tricorder readings to a laboratory chamber containing android bodies, all labeled \"Rayna\".\n\nFlint finally reveals the truth. He was born 3,834 years BC, and after falling in battle discovered he could not die. Flint has lived \"lifetimes\" as [[Methuselah]], [[Solomon]], [[Lazarus of Bethany]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], Brahms, and many others. Rayna is to be his mate, now that Kirk has taught her how to love. He intends also to keep the ''Enterprise'' crew in a suspended state, to protect his privacy, but relents on Rayna\u2019s objection. A fight then breaks out between the two men for the possession of Rayna. Rayna stops them, claiming her right to choose her own future, and then, overwhelmed by her newfound emotions, dies.\n\nBack on the ''Enterprise'', McCoy discovers that Flint, having left Earth\u2019s environment, is now aging normally. Kirk falls asleep on his desk wishing to forget Rayna, and Spock places a suggestion to \"forget\" into his mind.\n\n==Production and reception==\nRayna's last name, \"Kapec\", is an [[anagram]] of Capek, after [[Karel \u010capek]], who introduced the term \"[[robot]]\".{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Reception===\nIn 2017, [[Den of Geek]] ranked \"Requiem for Methuselah as the 15th worst ''Star Trek'' episode.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/go/258699|title=The 15 Best Worst Episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series|website=Den of Geek|language=en|access-date=2019-07-24}}</ref> The categorization they headline this listing with was \"These are the Star Trek episodes that you know are terrible, but can\u2019t stop watching,\" suggesting that although there may be various issues, the episode can hold a level of interest to the audiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Analysis===\nAccording to fantasy and science fiction scholar Ace G.

Mullins''' (born '''Michael John Mullins''', 9 November 1953) is an English lead vocalist, backing singer, and songwriter, best known as the lead singer of [[Salsa music|Salsa]] band [[Modern Romance (band)|Modern Romance]] (1982\u201385). Modern Romance achieved eight [[Top 40]] singles and two hit albums. After the band called it quits in 1985, Mullins continued working within the music industry, most notably as a backing singer for [[Cliff Richard]]: he can be seen singing with [[Cliff Richard]] live on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', on the [[Christmas number one single]], \"[[Mistletoe and Wine]]\" (1988).<ref name=\"MLW\">Lee-Williams, Matt: Modern Romance, Biography, Internet Movie Database [accessed] 27 April 2011.</ref> Mullins has since performed with [[Alan Parsons]] as part of [[The Alan Parsons Project]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Bluebear's Music Vault: World Liberty Concert: Alan Parsons and Friends, Sat 3 January 2009 [accessed 14 April 2012]</ref>\n\n==Early music (1981\u201382)==\nMullins began his music career as a backing vocalist and musician for [[Modern Romance (band)|Modern Romance]]. He is thanked on the sleeve of their debut album, ''[[Adventures in Clubland]]'' (1981), on which he provided vocals and guitar. During this time he also appeared with the band on episodes of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and provided further vocals on their single, \"By the Way (I'm Still in Love with You)\" (1982). The lead singer for Modern Romance was, at the time, [[Geoff Deane]], who had formed the band with David Jaymes, two remnants of punk rock band The Leighton Buzzards. Modern Romance had reached No. 1 in [[Venezuela]] with ''Adventures in Clubland'' \u2013 which also earned them a [[Gold Disc]] there \u2013 and had scored four UK hits, Mullins often lending his vocals and talents as a musician to their live TV appearances and studio work. However, in 1982, Deane would leave the band to pursue a solo career.<ref name=\"MLW\"/>\n\n==Modern Romance (1982\u201385)==\nFollowing the departure of [[Geoff Deane]] in late 1982, the Jaymes/Deane era came to an end, and Mullins took over as Lead vocalist for Modern Romance. Their first single \u2013 in what would become known as the Jaymes/Mullins era \u2013 climbed the UK charts, reaching the top-five. \"[[Best Years of Our Lives (1982 song)|Best Years of our Life]]\" \u2013 which peaked at No. 4 in the UK \u2013 would be the band's highest charting single. They quickly followed with the similar sounding single, \"[[High Life (1983 song)|High Life]]\", which climbed to the No. 8 position. Modern Romance were holding their own with bands such as [[Duran Duran]] and [[Spandau Ballet]], and a myriad TV and magazine appearances followed. They were regulars on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and made an appearance at the [[Royal Variety Performance]].<ref name=\"MLW\"/>\n\nModern Romance subsequently released their second studio album titled ''[[Trick of the Light (album)|Trick of the Light]]'' (1983). The album was a success, reaching No. 53 on the [[UK Album Chart]], and one significant change was the re-recording of the single \"[[Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White]]\" [New Version] (the new recording of this version was included on both ''Trick of the Light'' and ''[[Party Tonight]]'') with Mullins lending the song his softer vocals. The album itself has since made it into the [[Taschen]] book, ''1000 Record Covers'', that showcases the most interesting and original vinyl cover art from the 1960s \u2013 1990s (Mullins and David Jaymes grace the front cover of the album).<ref>Ochs, Michael, 1000 Record Covers, Taschen, 25th Edition, 2005, pp.700.</ref> The third single to be taken from ''Trick of the Light'' \u2013 \"[[Don't Stop That Crazy Rhythm]]\" (1983) \u2013 made the Top 20, eventually rising to No. 14. The final single \u2013 an uncharacteristic ballad titled \"[[Walking in the Rain (1983 song)|Walking in the Rain]]\" (1983) \u2013 settled again in the Top 10 at No. 7.<ref>Modern Romance, Discography, Discogs Website [accessed] 27 April 2011.</ref> Mullins toured with Modern Romance extensively, across Europe and the Far East; they picked-up silver and gold discs along the way, released the album ''Juanita'' (1983) in Japan, and reached the No. 1 spot in [[Thailand]] with \"Walking in the Rain\" (1983).<ref>Modern Romance, The Official Modern Romance Website [accessed] 27 April 2011.</ref>\n\nDespite Modern Romance being an established name in pop music, it seemed that David Jaymes and Mullins would remain generally at the forefront, their faces appearing on the majority of the record and magazine covers. [[gramophone record|Vinyl]] [[Picture disc]]s of the singles \"High Life\"  (1983) and \"Don't Stop That Crazy Rhythm\" (1983) indeed featured the faces and signatures of both Jaymes and Mullins (one on each side), as did the posters included with these singles. The pair also appeared in an article for the ''[[Tucker's Luck]]'' TV annual titled ''Best 1980s Artifact''; Mullins (and Jaymes) appeared alongside [[Nick Heyward]] of [[Haircut One Hundred]], [[Boy George]] of [[Culture Club]], [[Simon Le Bon]] of [[Duran Duran]], and [[Steve Norman]] of [[Spandau Ballet]].<ref name=\"MLW DJ\">Lee-Williams, Matt: Jaymes, David, Biography, Internet Movie Database [accessed] 27 April 2011.</ref><ref>Tucker's Luck Annual, IPC Publishing, 1983, Tucker's Luck: The Books [accessed] 27 April, 20.11.</ref> By now, Mullins was prominent enough in the industry to make personal appearances on show like [[Mike Read]]'s ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', whilst the band as a whole enjoyed live performances on TV shows hosted by [[Kenny Everett]], [[Russell Harty]], and [[The Krankies]].<ref name=\"MLW\"/><ref name=\"MLW DJ\"/>\n\nBy Christmas 1983 they were ready to release the album, ''[[Party Tonight]]'', a compilation containing all the band's hits from both the Jaymes/Deane era and the Jaymes/Mullins era, as well as a handful of [[cover version]]s and [[B-sides]]s. ''Party Tonight'' (1983) \u2013 produced by [[Tony Visconti]] and released in the UK on the Ronco label \u2013 made a significant dent on the [[UK Albums Chart]], cracking the Top-50 at No. 45. Mullins' vocals could also be heard \u2013 along with the rest of the band \u2013 across the radio waves, as jingles for the [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] evening show were adapted from various Modern Romance hits. The single, \"[[Good Friday (1983 song)|Good Friday]]\" / \"Good Feelings\" [re-mix] was released simultaneously and reached the UK No. 96 position. Both ''Party Tonight'' and ''Good Friday'' shared the same cover art, a photo still captured from the band's 1983 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] advert for ''Party Tonight''. It was around this time that band member [[John Du Prez]] went his own way and, taking stock of the poor success of the single ''Good Friday'', Modern Romance decided it was time for a change in both image and music style.\n\nThe mid-1980s, however, were not as kind to the band. Modern Romance began with a new look, Mullins and the band now sporting long hair and leather jackets.<ref>Just My Imagination, Single Cover Photo, 1984.</ref><ref>Burn It!, Album Cover Photo, 1984.</ref> The first single released alongside the band's new image was a cover version of the song \"[[Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)]]\" (1984): the single failed to chart, as did their third studio album, ''[[Burn It!]]'' (1984), and its subsequent singles: \"[[Burn It!

After the band called it quits in 1985, Mullins continued working within the music industry, most notably as a backing singer for [[Cliff Richard]]: he can be seen singing with [[Cliff Richard]] live on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', on the [[Christmas number one single]], \"[[Mistletoe and Wine]]\" (1988).<ref name=\"MLW\">Lee-Williams, Matt: Modern Romance, Biography, Internet Movie Database [accessed] 27 April 2011.</ref> Mullins has since performed with [[Alan Parsons]] as part of [[The Alan Parsons Project]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Bluebear's Music Vault: World Liberty Concert: Alan Parsons and Friends, Sat 3 January 2009 [accessed 14 April 2012]</ref>\n\n==Early music (1981\u201382)==\nMullins began his music career as a backing vocalist and musician for [[Modern Romance (band)|Modern Romance]]. He is thanked on the sleeve of their debut album, ''[[Adventures in Clubland]]'' (1981), on which he provided vocals and guitar. During this time he also appeared with the band on episodes of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', and provided further vocals on their single, \"By the Way (I'm Still in Love with You)\" (1982). The lead singer for Modern Romance was, at the time, [[Geoff Deane]], who had formed the band with David Jaymes, two remnants of punk rock band The Leighton Buzzards. Modern Romance had reached No. 1 in [[Venezuela]] with ''Adventures in Clubland'' \u2013 which also earned them a [[Gold Disc]] there \u2013 and had scored four UK hits, Mullins often lending his vocals and talents as a musician to their live TV appearances and studio work. However, in 1982, Deane would leave the band to pursue a solo career.<ref name=\"MLW\"/>\n\n==Modern Romance (1982\u201385)==\nFollowing the departure of [[Geoff Deane]] in late 1982, the Jaymes/Deane era came to an end, and Mullins took over as Lead vocalist for Modern Romance. Their first single \u2013 in what would become known as the Jaymes/Mullins era \u2013 climbed the UK charts, reaching the top-five. \"[[Best Years of Our Lives (1982 song)|Best Years of our Life]]\" \u2013 which peaked at No. 4 in the UK \u2013 would be the band's highest charting single. They quickly followed with the similar sounding single, \"[[High Life (1983 song)|High Life]]\", which climbed to the No. 8 position. Modern Romance were holding their own with bands such as [[Duran Duran]] and [[Spandau Ballet]], and a myriad TV and magazine appearances followed. They were regulars on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and made an appearance at the [[Royal Variety Performance]].<ref name=\"MLW\"/>\n\nModern Romance subsequently released their second studio album titled ''[[Trick of the Light (album)|Trick of the Light]]'' (1983). The album was a success, reaching No. 53 on the [[UK Album Chart]], and one significant change was the re-recording of the single \"[[Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White]]\" [New Version] (the new recording of this version was included on both ''Trick of the Light'' and ''[[Party Tonight]]'') with Mullins lending the song his softer vocals. The album itself has since made it into the [[Taschen]] book, ''1000 Record Covers'', that showcases the most interesting and original vinyl cover art from the 1960s \u2013 1990s (Mullins and David Jaymes grace the front cover of the album).<ref>Ochs, Michael, 1000 Record Covers, Taschen, 25th Edition, 2005, pp.700.</ref> The third single to be taken from ''Trick of the Light'' \u2013 \"[[Don't Stop That Crazy Rhythm]]\" (1983) \u2013 made the Top 20, eventually rising to No. 14. The final single \u2013 an uncharacteristic ballad titled \"[[Walking in the Rain (1983 song)|Walking in the Rain]]\" (1983) \u2013 settled again in the Top 10 at No. 7.<ref>Modern Romance, Discography, Discogs Website [accessed] 27 April 2011.</ref> Mullins toured with Modern Romance extensively, across Europe and the Far East; they picked-up silver and gold discs along the way, released the album ''Juanita'' (1983) in Japan, and reached the No. 1 spot in [[Thailand]] with \"Walking in the Rain\" (1983).<ref>Modern Romance, The Official Modern Romance Website [accessed] 27 April 2011.</ref>\n\nDespite Modern Romance being an established name in pop music, it seemed that David Jaymes and Mullins would remain generally at the forefront, their faces appearing on the majority of the record and magazine covers. [[gramophone record|Vinyl]] [[Picture disc]]s of the singles \"High Life\"  (1983) and \"Don't Stop That Crazy Rhythm\" (1983) indeed featured the faces and signatures of both Jaymes and Mullins (one on each side), as did the posters included with these singles. The pair also appeared in an article for the ''[[Tucker's Luck]]'' TV annual titled ''Best 1980s Artifact''; Mullins (and Jaymes) appeared alongside [[Nick Heyward]] of [[Haircut One Hundred]], [[Boy George]] of [[Culture Club]], [[Simon Le Bon]] of [[Duran Duran]], and [[Steve Norman]] of [[Spandau Ballet]].<ref name=\"MLW DJ\">Lee-Williams, Matt: Jaymes, David, Biography, Internet Movie Database [accessed] 27 April 2011.</ref><ref>Tucker's Luck Annual, IPC Publishing, 1983, Tucker's Luck: The Books [accessed] 27 April, 20.11.</ref> By now, Mullins was prominent enough in the industry to make personal appearances on show like [[Mike Read]]'s ''[[Pop Quiz]]'', whilst the band as a whole enjoyed live performances on TV shows hosted by [[Kenny Everett]], [[Russell Harty]], and [[The Krankies]].<ref name=\"MLW\"/><ref name=\"MLW DJ\"/>\n\nBy Christmas 1983 they were ready to release the album, ''[[Party Tonight]]'', a compilation containing all the band's hits from both the Jaymes/Deane era and the Jaymes/Mullins era, as well as a handful of [[cover version]]s and [[B-sides]]s. ''Party Tonight'' (1983) \u2013 produced by [[Tony Visconti]] and released in the UK on the Ronco label \u2013 made a significant dent on the [[UK Albums Chart]], cracking the Top-50 at No. 45. Mullins' vocals could also be heard \u2013 along with the rest of the band \u2013 across the radio waves, as jingles for the [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] evening show were adapted from various Modern Romance hits. The single, \"[[Good Friday (1983 song)|Good Friday]]\" / \"Good Feelings\" [re-mix] was released simultaneously and reached the UK No. 96 position. Both ''Party Tonight'' and ''Good Friday'' shared the same cover art, a photo still captured from the band's 1983 [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] advert for ''Party Tonight''. It was around this time that band member [[John Du Prez]] went his own way and, taking stock of the poor success of the single ''Good Friday'', Modern Romance decided it was time for a change in both image and music style.\n\nThe mid-1980s, however, were not as kind to the band. Modern Romance began with a new look, Mullins and the band now sporting long hair and leather jackets.<ref>Just My Imagination, Single Cover Photo, 1984.</ref><ref>Burn It!, Album Cover Photo, 1984.</ref> The first single released alongside the band's new image was a cover version of the song \"[[Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)]]\" (1984): the single failed to chart, as did their third studio album, ''[[Burn It!]]'' (1984), and its subsequent singles: \"[[Burn It! (single)|Burn It!]]\" (1984), \"[[That's What Friends Are For (1984 song)|That's What Friends Are For]]\" (1984) and \"[[Move On (1984 single)|Move On]]\" (1984).  The album was produced by [[Tony Visconti]] and featured additional percussion by [[Luis Jardim]]. They released a cover version of \"[[Tarzan Boy (1985)|Tarzan Boy]]\" and finally the anthology single, \"[[Best Mix of Our Lives]]\" (1985), which contained the hit singles \"Everybody Salsa\", \"Ay Ay Ay Ay Moosey\", \"High Life\", \"Don't Stop That Crazy Rhythm\", and \"Best Years of Our Lives\". \"Best Mix of Our Lives\" reached No. 81 on the UK chart.\n\nIt was reported in a 1985 edition of ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' that Mullins was to quit Modern Romance.<ref>''The Sun'', 1985, Newspaper, Bizarre Page [issue unknown].</ref> Many 1980s pop bands were suffering towards the close of the 1980s and it seemed that Modern Romance were unable to shake that Latin Beat. Mullins would turn full circle and return primarily to the role of backing vocalist.\n\n==Post-Modern Romance (1985\u2013present)==\nSince leaving Modern Romance in 1985, Mullins has worked with [[Samantha Fox]], [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Donny Osmond]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[George Harrison]], [[Christopher Cross]], [[James Ingram]], [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], [[Alan Parsons]] and [[The Alan Parsons Project]], [[The Celtic Tenors]], [[Robbie Williams]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]], [[Ronan Browne]], [[Gavyn Wright]], Patrick Kernan, Keith Murrell, [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]], and [[Peter Howarth]] of [[The Hollies]] among others.<ref>Discogs Website [accessed] 16 April 2012</ref><ref>Michael Mullins CV, doublefvoices.com [accessed] 16 August 2013</ref>\n\nHe performed a duet with [[Joni Mitchell]] \u2013 \"Good Friends\" \u2013 on ''[[Wogan]]'' (1985)<ref>Mitchell, Joni, JoniMitchell.Com, Chronology 1985.12.06, BBC2 TV</ref> and in 1986 penned the song \"It's Only Love\" which was used as a b-side for the singles \"[[My Boy Lollipop]]\" (Lulu) and \"[[Hold On Tight (Samantha Fox song)|Hold on Tight]]\" (Fox). He further penned the b-sides for Fox's singles \"[[Do Ya Do Ya (Wanna Please Me)]]\" and \"[[Touch Me (I Want Your Body)]]\"; the songs were titled \"Drop Me A Line\" and \"Never Fall in Love Again\" respectively.<ref>Lulu, Discography, Discogs Website [accessed] 16 April 2013</ref><ref>Samantha Fox, Discography, Discogs Website [accessed] 16 April 2013</ref>\n\nMullins provided backing vocals for [[Cliff Richard]] on his No. 1 hit \"[[Mistletoe and Wine]]\" (1988); he also appeared on the live recording, which aired on ''Top of the Pops'' that same year (December).
