Major Joseph W. Wham was transporting a payroll from [[Fort Grant, Arizona|Fort Grant, Arizona Territory]] to [[Fort Thomas, Arizona|Fort Thomas]] when he and his escort of eleven [[Buffalo Soldier]]s were ambushed.  During the attack, the bandits wounded eight of the soldiers, forced them to retreat to cover, and stole the payroll.  As a result of their actions under fire Sergeant [[Benjamin Brown (Medal of Honor)|Benjamin Brown]] and Corporal [[Isaiah Mays]] were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] while eight other soldiers received a [[Certifte of Merit]].  Eleven men, most from the nearby Mormon community of [[Pima, Arizona|Pima]], were arrested with eight tried on charges of robbery.  At trial, all the accused were found not guilty, and the stolen money has never been recovered.\n\n==Background==\n\nIn April 1889, Special Order 37 directed all [[paymaster]]s in the [[District of Arizona]] to pay troops [[Muster (military)|mustered]] as of April 30.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=101}}  Major Joseph Washington Wham, a [[U.S. Army]] paymaster, was assigned [[Fort Bowie]], [[Fort Grant, Arizona|Fort Grant]], [[Fort Thomas, Arizona|Fort Thomas]], [[Fort Apache, Arizona|Fort Apache]] and [[San Carlos, Arizona|Camp San Carlos]].{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|pp=101\u20132}}  Wham and his clerk, William T.

Wham]]\nEarly on May 11, Major Wham left Fort Grant with two mule-drawn carriages, a covered ambulance and an open wagon, for the {{convert|46|mi|adj=on}} journey to Fort Thomas.  The remaining payroll consisted of [[US$]]28,345.10 in gold and silver coins and weighed an estimated {{convert|250|lb}}.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=102}}  The commander of Fort Grant had assigned eleven enlisted [[Buffalo Soldier]]s from the [[24th Infantry Regiment (United States)|24th Infantry]] and [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry]] to serve as an escort between his fort and Fort Thomas.  In addition to the military personnel, there was a civilian contractor who drove the open wagon.  The two [[non-commissioned officer]]s leading the escort were armed with revolvers while the [[Private (rank)|privates]] carried single shot rifles and carbines.  Wham and the civilian members of the convoy were unarmed. Accompanying Wham on the journey was a black woman, Frankie Campbell (also known as Frankie Stratton).  Campbell was the wife of a soldier stationed at Fort Grant and was going to collect gambling debts owed to her and her husband by soldiers stationed at Fort Thomas.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=103}}\n\nThere had never been an attack by highwaymen upon a paymaster within Arizona Territory prior to May 1889.<ref name=\"BattleWithBrigands\" /> Despite this, there were several factors favoring such an attack.  The territory was remote and had only a small scattered population.  Many residents of Arizona Territory held the [[U.S. Federal government]] in low regard, feeling it ruled the territory from Washington with little interest in the territorial residents' well being.  Compounding this was the fact that most [[White people|white]] residents of Arizona had been either [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] or Confederate sympathizers.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=107}}  Decades of hostilities between Washington and the [[Church of Latter-day Saints]] left hard feelings among the territory's [[Mormon]] population.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=108}}  Recent efforts to enforce the [[Edmunds Act]], which made [[polygamy]] a [[felony]], had increased anger among this group.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=177}}  Finally, strong racial biases were held by the white population against the black soldiers were exacerbated by Mormon teachings that placed blacks on a lower rung of society.  This led to a situation where some area residents could have easily rationalized that the payroll would have been better spent supporting the local communities instead of in the hands of black soldiers who were seen as likely to spend it on immoral pursuits.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=108}}\n\nThe road to Fort Thomas went southwest to the town of [[Bonita, Arizona|Bonita]] before turning north and following the western side of [[Mount Graham]].{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=103}}  About {{convert|25|mi}} from Fort Grant the road entered a pass leading to the [[Gila River]] valley.  Wham's convoy reached Cedar Springs, in the pass, around noon and swapped his mules for fresh set that were waiting at the NN ranch.  Campbell, whose horse was faster than Wham's wagons, had waited at a stagecoach half-way station a short distance further down the road.  The station was operated by Mormon polygamist Wiley Holladay.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=104}}  Holladay was away that day, leaving his wives, Harriet and Eliza, to run the place.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|pp=104\u20136}} Wham and his escort reached the station around 12:45&nbsp;pm at which time Campbell rejoined the group.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=104}}\n\n==Robbery==\nThe site of the attack was about {{convert|3|mi}} north of the stagecoach station.<ref name=\"BattleWithBrigands\" /> The road at that point descended from a high ridge through a narrow gorge to a [[creek bed]].<ref name=\"WhamInterview\">{{cite news|title=An Interview \u2013 With Major Wham Giving Full Particulars of the Famous Hold-up on the Fort Thomas Road | date=May 25, 1889 |  newspaper=Arizona Weekly Citizen | location=Tucson, Arizona Territory | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015133/1889-05-25/ed-1/seq-3/#words=Major+Wham&proxtext=major+wham |page=3}}</ref> The east side of the gorge consisted of a steep rocky slope rising about {{convert|50|ft}} above the road with a lower rise on the western side.<ref name=\"FoughtNobly\">{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1889-05-14/ed-1/seq-5/#words=robbery+Robbery+Wham&proxtext=wham+robbery&page=1|title=They Fought Nobly \u2013 But the Robbers Were Too Much for Paymaster Wham's Party|date=May 14, 1889|work=Evening Star|page=5|location=Washington, D. C.}}</ref> Along the top of the eastern side a series of [[Breastwork (fortification)|breastworks]] had been constructed by the bandits.<ref name=\"WhamInterview\" /> In an apparent attempt to make the fortifications appear more daunting, [[yucca]] stalks were fashioned to look like rifle barrels and positioned in the breastworks.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=110}}\n\nAbout 1:00&nbsp;pm the Wham party reached the site of the attack.  Campbell, who was in the lead, was attempting to guide her horse around a boulder that was blocking the road as the rest of the party crested a hill.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=111}}  After the convoy halted, Sergeant [[Benjamin Brown (Medal of Honor)|Benjamin Brown]] led his men forward to try to move the obstacle out of the road while Corporal [[Isaiah Mays]] took a position at the rear of the convoy.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|pp=111\u20132}}  As they approached the rock, the group saw evidence that the rock had been deliberately placed in the road.  As they then looked up to see where the rock had come from, the soldiers saw two men stand up from a breastwork situated above them.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=112}}  Neither of the two men wore masks and the soldiers later identified their attackers as [[Wilfred T. Webb]] and Mark E. Cunningham.  Local folklore suggests some bandits may have donned disguises, with one attacker dressed to resemble a local figure name William Ellison \"Cyclone Bill\" Beck. {{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=110-2}}  Cunningham was armed with a rifle.  Webb brandished a pair of revolvers and yelled, \"Get out, you black sons of bitches!\"{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=112}}  The bandits then began to fire toward the convoy.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=112}}\n\nThe first volley from the attackers killed three mules and wounded the ambulance driver.<ref name=\"WhamInterview\" /> The wounded ambulance driver dragged himself to a dry creek bed about {{convert|170|ft|-1}} away.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=113}}  The bandits apparently held a condescending opinion of the Buffalo soldiers' fighting ability and thought they could be easily defeated.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=110}}  This likely played a part in the opening moments of the battle with the attackers firing mostly over the heads of the Buffalo Soldiers in an effort designed to scare them away.  It was not until the military escort began to provide a determined resistance that the attackers began to shoot directly at the soldiers.<ref name=\"WhamInterview\" />\n\nThe civilian driving the open wagon abandoned his vehicle as the gunfight began, fleeing to safety. Campbell's horse spooked at the sound of the weapons and threw her before it ran back toward the stagecoach station.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=113}}  The bandits called Campbell's name and fired a couple shots in her direction before turning their attention elsewhere.  Campbell then crawled behind a bush and some rocks located about {{convert|50|ft}} past the ambulance.  She observed the rest of the fight from this position.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=114}}\n\nThe soldiers, who had set their rifles down while preparing to move the boulder, quickly grabbed their weapons and ran for cover.<ref name=\"BattleWithBrigands\" /> Sgt. Brown and two privates were separated from the rest of the group and forced down the road.  After finding cover, Brown, even though wounded in his arm, fired his revolver at the bandits that had stood up.  After emptying his revolver, he took a rifle from one of the privates and continued the fight.  It was not until one of the two privates was wounded, and the sergeant shot a second time, that the three men retreated to a dry creek bed about {{convert|300|ft}} away.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=115}}\n\nMajor Wham initially took shelter behind the ambulance.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=114}}  The remaining draft animals panicked at the sound of the gunfire and dragged both wagons off the west side of the road, damaging their harnesses in the process.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|pp=112\u20133}}  This forced Wham to retreat behind a small rocky ledge on the west side of the road.  He was joined behind the outcropping by his clerk and most of the soldiers.  Wham directed the soldiers' fire while his clerk rendered aid to the wounded.  Both men, initially unarmed, later took rifles from wounded soldiers and joined in the fight.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=114}}  Mays initially returned fire with his revolver from behind the escort wagon.  This position soon proved to be untenable and he joined Wham behind the rocky ledge.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=116}}  While Wham and his men were pinned down there, the bandits maneuvered along the top of the ridge to get them into a crossfire.<ref name=\"FoughtNobly\"/> About 30 minutes after the battle began, Mays, who had assumed command of the escort following the withdrawal of Sergeant Brown, informed Wham that their position was no longer defensible and that he was ordering his men to withdraw.  Wham initially objected to this choice but later admitted that Mays had made the correct military decision.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=117}}\n\nFrom the rocky ledge, Wham and Mays withdrew to the nearby dry creek bed.  There Wham attempted to rally the soldiers to retake the lock box holding the payroll, but after seeing that eight of the eleven soldiers were wounded realized that was not a viable option.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|pp=117\u20138}}  With the soldiers located about {{convert|300|yd}} from their initial defensive position, the bandits continued to fire at them.  With the soldiers pinned down, several of the bandits descended the hill and opened the strongbox holding the payroll with an axe.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=118}}  About 2:30&nbsp;pm the bandits stopped firing and left in two groups.  The first group led a mule carrying what appeared to be a man slumped over it and the second group providing cover to the first.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=119}}\n\nIt was not until around 3:00&nbsp;pm that the soldiers returned to the ambulance and Campbell left her hiding place.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=119}}  They discovered the nine surviving mules had run off during the attack and their harnesses had been cut to pieces.<ref name=\"WhamInterview\" /> As the soldiers returned to the ambulance, Harriet Holladay arrived on the scene in her [[buckboard]].  She had heard the gunfire and decided to investigate when Campbell's riderless horse arrived at the station house.  Upon her arrival she joined with Campbell to provide first aid to the wounded soldiers.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=119}}  Four of the mules were located by the nearby creek bed and the soldiers were able to splice together enough of the harnesses to hitch them to the ambulance.<ref name=\"WhamInterview\" /> Most of the wounded were loaded into the ambulance for transport to Fort Thomas.  Sergeant Brown and one other man were deemed too severely injured to move and were tended by Campbell until the surgeon from Fort Thomas could be dispatched to retrieve them.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=120}}  As the convoy was preparing to leave, rancher Barney Norton, who had also heard the sounds of the battle, arrived with a group of his ranch hands.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=119}}  Wham arrived at Fort Thomas about 5:30&nbsp;pm.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=120}}\n\n==Investigation==\nBefore leaving the site of the attack, Wham conducted an initial investigation of the immediate area.  A valise containing the major's personal items, which had been stored in the strongbox, had been cut open but the robbers had left the contents undamaged.  A second valise, containing payroll receipts from his previous stops, had been taken along with the money.  An examination of the breastworks on top of the ridge found one of the fortifications contained over 200 spent rifle casings.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=119}}  Wham also arrested Campbell at the site of the attack, believing she had been somehow involved.  She was released a short time later and became an important witness for investigators.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=120}}\n\nAfter Wham arrived at Fort Thomas, a contingent of soldiers was sent to guard the scene of the attack until a complete sketch of the site could be completed.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=120}}  Troops stationed throughout southern Arizona Territory were also deployed in an effort to prevent the robbers from escaping into [[Mexico]].<ref name=\"BattleWithBrigands\" /> About 10&nbsp;am on May 12, [[Graham County, Arizona|Graham County]] Sheriff Billy Whelan, Sr., accompanied by several deputies and a group of Buffalo Soldiers, attempted to follow the bandits' trail.  Local lore claims the robbers fled southward until they passed through a herd of horses several miles from the attack site.  There they divided the loot and went in separate directions.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=120}}  The sheriff eventually found a trail leading toward the [[Gila River]] that led to the Follet Ranch.  The portion of the trail leading to the river appeared to have been made by horses that had had their horseshoes attached backwards.  The shoes were then removed at the river in further effort to confuse the trail.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=120-1}}  Additional trails leading to other ranches were discovered on May 13.  The Sheriff asked the residents of these ranches about their whereabouts on May 11.  \"The ranchers\", Deputy Billy Whelan, Jr. later described, \"hemmed and hawed and tried to make us think they were at other places. But the buffalo soldiers identified them.\"{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=121}}\n\nMeanwhile, the valise containing the payroll receipts was located about {{convert|1.5|mi}} from the ambush site with the pay stubs covered in blood.<ref name=\"WhamInterview\" /> Based upon this evidence and reports by Campbell and Wham's clerk that the bandits had carried away been what appeared to be a man's body on a mule, it was assumed that one or two of the attackers had been killed during the battle.  No body was ever discovered however, and no missing person reports for people living in the area were ever received by local authorities.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=121}}\n\nOn May 13, 1889, Governor [[Lewis Wolfley]] announced a $500 reward for the arrest and conviction of one or more of the bandits.<ref>{{cite news|title=Proclamation of Reward|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84021912/1889-06-01/ed-1/seq-2/#words=Paymaster+Wham&proxtext=wham+paymaster |newspaper=The Arizona Sentinel| location=Yuma, Arizona Territory | date=June 1, 1889 | page=2}}</ref> The [[United States Marshal]] for Arizona, [[William K. Meade]], also joined in the investigation.  Based upon the initial findings, Meade and Sheriff Whelan focused their investigation on the area around [[Pima, Arizona|Pima, Arizona Territory]].{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=121}}  Numerous arrests were made but most of the arrested men were soon released due to a lack of evidence.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=122}}\n\nReaction to events in the predominantly Mormon town of Pima was divided into two camps.  About half the town was generally cooperative with the investigation.  The other half viewed it as a return to federal persecution.  The wife of the owner of the Pima Hotel summarized this sentiment by saying, \"It's just following the usual pattern. From the time I first learned of the robbery I have expected nothing else than that it would be laid on to the Mormons.\"{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=123}}  The opposition even accused deputy marshals of planting gold coins found in the possession of prominent church members and making indiscriminate arrests in an effort to collect reward money.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=177}}\n\nMarshal Meade arrested M. E. Cunningham based upon information provided by Frankie Campbell.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=176}}  This was soon followed by the arrests of Ed Follett, Lyman Follett, Warren Follett, Thomas N. Lamb, David Rogers, Siebert Henderson, Gilbert Webb, and [[Wilfred T. Webb|Wilfred Webb]] on May 13.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=177}}{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=123}}  William Ellison \"Cyclone Bill\" Beck was also arrested soon after the robbery.  While waiting in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] for his [[alibi]] to be confirmed, Beck began drawing the attention of the locals.  Enough visitors came to see him that he began charging a fee for the viewings of \"the raw head and bloody bones of the Gila Valley\" and claimed he \"could make enough money to pay all my expenses in this damn trial.\"{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=122-3}} Beck's alibi was confirmed and he was released from custody.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=122}}  Henderson and Ed Follett were likewise released due to a lack of evidence.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=123}}  During a preliminary hearing before [[United States magistrate judge|Magistrate]] [[L. C. Hughes]], none of the others were able to provide an alibi and only Gilbert Webb was able to post bail.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=123-4}}\n\nThe suspected ringleader was Gilbert Webb, the serving Mayor of Pima and a leading member of the [[Graham County, Arizona|Graham County]] Democratic party.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=106}}  Within the Mormon community he was held in high regard by the community due to the jobs he provided through his various businesses.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=106}}  Non-Mormon neighbors of Gilbert Webb had a less generous view of the man, noting he had left Utah a decade earlier to avoid charges of grand larceny.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|pp=106\u20137}}  There was also a pattern of property disappearances that seemed to occur near places the Webb family had lived or worked.  During the six years preceding the robbery, Webb had experienced some financial setbacks that had forced him to close his store and sell his stagecoach line.  He had recently obtained a contract to provide straw and grain to Fort Thomas and San Carlos but may have lacked the needed financial resources to raise these crops.  Webb's lack of the short-term capital needed to meet his end of this contract was a possible motive for the robbery.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=107}}  While he was out on bail, Webb spent his time searching for witnesses willing to testify on behalf of him and his fellow defendants.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=124}}\n\nWhile most of the accused were not active members of the [[LDS Church]], they were all related to active church members and all considered to be outstanding members of the community.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=109}}\n\n==Trial==\n[[File:Wham Paymaster Robbery Defendants and Counsel.jpg|thumb|Defendants and defense counsel for the Wham Paymaster Robbery trial]]\n\nA U.S. Federal [[grand jury]] was convened in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in late September 1889.

Upon learning of the telegram, Judge Barnes dismissed the Grand Jury, calling them \"a band of character assassins, unworthy to sit in any court of justice.\"{{sfn|McClintock|1916|p=472}}  A few days after the telegram was sent, President [[Benjamin Harrison]] appointed [[Richard E.

Three horses were shot and multiple head of cattle were stolen from the defendants and their friends.  Ed Follett was arrested for trying to intimidate a prosecution witness into changing his testimony.  Finally, the [[Solomonville, Arizona|Solomonville]] district court clerk, and former Graham County sheriff, Ben M.

Wham was embarrassed by his inability to differentiate between the coins from the bank and those he claimed had come from the robbery.{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=31}}  Frankie Campbell also gave testimony.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=126}}  Smith vigorously cross examined each prosecution witnesses, leading many to admit that they had not had clear views of the attackers.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=178}}  Compounding difficulties for the prosecution were differences in the [[slang]] used by the black witnesses and the white jurors.  This, combined with a reluctance by many area residents to condemn a man based upon the word of a former slave, may have caused the jury to minimize the validity of the prosecution case.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=128}}\n\nThe defense provided a series of witness, described as \"brothers, sisters, cousins, and aunts of each other and the defendants,\" to provide alibis for the accused.  Due to the conflicting testimony provided by various witnesses, the defense took five hours for their closing arguments.  Smith used this time to play upon the biases and prejudices of the jury.{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=31}}  He argued that the robbers had dressed in a manner similar to his clients in order to misdirect suspicion upon them and that the robbers had fled to Mexico immediately after the robbery.  Then he pointed out that U.S. Marshal Meade had failed to go to the scene of the attack to look for any trail left by the attackers.  Smith also claimed the government officials who arrested his clients were more interested in the reward money for capturing the robbers than in finding the people who actually committed the crime.{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=32}}  When Smith began to question the integrity of the Court, Judge Sloan threatened him with a $500 fine for [[Contempt of court|contempt]].{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=31-2}}\n\nThe jury deliberated for two hours before delivering a not guilty verdict.{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=32}}<ref>{{cite news|title=All Acquitted | date=December 16, 1889 |  newspaper=Sacramento Daily Record-Union  | page=1 | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014381/1889-12-16/ed-1/seq-1/#words=Major+Wham&proxtext=major+wham}}</ref>  Deputy William \"Billy\" Breakenridge noted after the trial, \"the Government had a good case against them [the robbers], but they had too many friends willing to swear to an alibi, and there were too many on the jury who thought it no harm to rob the Government.\"{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=178}}\n\n==Later events==\n[[File:Isaiah Mays.jpg|thumb|upright|Isaiah Mays with a Medal of Honor]]\n\nGeneral reaction to the verdict was one of shock and amazement.{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=32}}  In response to public reaction to the quick verdict, the jury issued a statement saying, \"We were present during the entire time of the trial, we heard everything that was said and saw everything that was done in the courtroom and heard nothing of what was being done and said outside, hence when we had agreed upon a verdict we did not know of anything to keep us in the jury room longer.\"{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=127}}  A misunderstanding of the [[jury instructions]] may have also played a role in the verdict.  The jury's understanding of the instructions was that they were required to find all of defendants guilty in order to convict and as they could not agree that all eight were involved they felt required to return a not guilty verdict.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=127}}\n\nU.S. Attorney Jeffords became seriously ill shortly after the trial and died several months later.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=130}}  Major Wham in turn was held responsible for the lost funds.

Major Joseph W. Wham was transporting a payroll from [[Fort Grant, Arizona|Fort Grant, Arizona Territory]] to [[Fort Thomas, Arizona|Fort Thomas]] when he and his escort of eleven [[Buffalo Soldier]]s and [[Black Seminole  Scouts were ambushed.  During the attack, the bandits wounded eight of the soldiers, forced them to retreat to cover, and stole the payroll.  As a result of their actions under fire two of the scouts, Sergeant [[Benjamin Brown (Medal of Honor)|Benjamin Brown]] and Corporal [[Isaiah Mays]] were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] while eight other soldiers received a [[Certificate of Merit]].  Eleven men, most from the nearby Mormon community of [[Pima, Arizona|Pima]], were arrested with eight tried on charges of robbery.  At trial, all the accused were found not guilty, and the stolen money has never been recovered.\n\n==Background==\n\nIn April 1889, Special Order 37 directed all [[paymaster]]s in the [[District of Arizona]] to pay troops [[Muster (military)|mustered]] as of April 30.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=101}}  Major Joseph Washington Wham, a [[U.S. Army]] paymaster, was assigned [[Fort Bowie]], [[Fort Grant, Arizona|Fort Grant]], [[Fort Thomas, Arizona|Fort Thomas]], [[Fort Apache, Arizona|Fort Apache]] and [[San Carlos, Arizona|Camp San Carlos]].{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|pp=101\u20132}}  Wham and his clerk, William T.

The remaining payroll consisted of [[US$]]28,345.10 in gold and silver coins and weighed an estimated {{convert|250|lb}}.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=102}}  The commander of Fort Grant had assigned eleven enlisted [[Buffalo Soldier]]s from the [[24th Infantry Regiment (United States)|24th Infantry]] and [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry]] to serve as an escort between his fort and Fort Thomas.  In addition to the military personnel, there was a civilian contractor who drove the open wagon.  The two [[non-commissioned officer]]s leading the escort were armed with revolvers while the [[Private (rank)|privates]] carried single shot rifles and carbines.  Wham and the civilian members of the convoy were unarmed. Accompanying Wham on the journey was a black woman, Frankie Campbell (also known as Frankie Stratton).  Campbell was the wife of a soldier stationed at Fort Grant and was going to collect gambling debts owed to her and her husband by soldiers stationed at Fort Thomas.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=103}}\n\nThere had never been an attack by highwaymen upon a paymaster within Arizona Territory prior to May 1889.<ref name=\"BattleWithBrigands\" /> Despite this, there were several factors favoring such an attack.  The territory was remote and had only a small scattered population.  Many residents of Arizona Territory held the [[U.S. Federal government]] in low regard, feeling it ruled the territory from Washington with little interest in the territorial residents' well being.  Compounding this was the fact that most [[White people|white]] residents of Arizona had been either [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]] or Confederate sympathizers.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=107}}  Decades of hostilities between Washington and the [[Church of Latter-day Saints]] left hard feelings among the territory's [[Mormon]] population.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=108}}  Recent efforts to enforce the [[Edmunds Act]], which made [[polygamy]] a [[felony]], had increased anger among this group.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=177}}  Finally, strong racial biases were held by the white population against the black soldiers were exacerbated by Mormon teachings that placed blacks on a lower rung of society.  This led to a situation where some area residents could have easily rationalized that the payroll would have been better spent supporting the local communities instead of in the hands of black soldiers who were seen as likely to spend it on immoral pursuits.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=108}}\n\nThe road to Fort Thomas went southwest to the town of [[Bonita, Arizona|Bonita]] before turning north and following the western side of [[Mount Graham]].{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=103}}  About {{convert|25|mi}} from Fort Grant the road entered a pass leading to the [[Gila River]] valley.  Wham's convoy reached Cedar Springs, in the pass, around noon and swapped his mules for fresh set that were waiting at the NN ranch.  Campbell, whose horse was faster than Wham's wagons, had waited at a stagecoach half-way station a short distance further down the road.  The station was operated by Mormon polygamist Wiley Holladay.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=104}}  Holladay was away that day, leaving his wives, Harriet and Eliza, to run the place.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|pp=104\u20136}} Wham and his escort reached the station around 12:45&nbsp;pm at which time Campbell rejoined the group.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=104}}\n\n==Robbery==\nThe site of the attack was about {{convert|3|mi}} north of the stagecoach station.<ref name=\"BattleWithBrigands\" /> The road at that point descended from a high ridge through a narrow gorge to a [[creek bed]].<ref name=\"WhamInterview\">{{cite news|title=An Interview \u2013 With Major Wham Giving Full Particulars of the Famous Hold-up on the Fort Thomas Road | date=May 25, 1889 |  newspaper=Arizona Weekly Citizen | location=Tucson, Arizona Territory | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015133/1889-05-25/ed-1/seq-3/#words=Major+Wham&proxtext=major+wham |page=3}}</ref> The east side of the gorge consisted of a steep rocky slope rising about {{convert|50|ft}} above the road with a lower rise on the western side.<ref name=\"FoughtNobly\">{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045462/1889-05-14/ed-1/seq-5/#words=robbery+Robbery+Wham&proxtext=wham+robbery&page=1|title=They Fought Nobly \u2013 But the Robbers Were Too Much for Paymaster Wham's Party|date=May 14, 1889|work=Evening Star|page=5|location=Washington, D.

Campbell, who was in the lead, was attempting to guide her horse around a boulder that was blocking the road as the rest of the party crested a hill.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=111}}  After the convoy halted, Sergeant [[Benjamin Brown (Medal of Honor)|Benjamin Brown]] led his men forward to try to move the obstacle out of the road while Corporal [[Isaiah Mays]] took a position at the rear of the convoy.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|pp=111\u20132}}  As they approached the rock, the group saw evidence that the rock had been deliberately placed in the road.  As they then looked up to see where the rock had come from, the soldiers saw two men stand up from a breastwork situated above them.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=112}}  Neither of the two men wore masks and the soldiers later identified their attackers as [[Wilfred T. Webb]] and Mark E. Cunningham.  Local folklore suggests some bandits may have donned disguises, with one attacker dressed to resemble a local figure name William Ellison \"Cyclone Bill\" Beck. {{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=110-2}}  Cunningham was armed with a rifle.  Webb brandished a pair of revolvers and yelled, \"Get out, you black sons of bitches!\"{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=112}}  The bandits then began to fire toward the convoy.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=112}}\n\nThe first volley from the attackers killed three mules and wounded the ambulance driver.<ref name=\"WhamInterview\" /> The wounded ambulance driver dragged himself to a dry creek bed about {{convert|170|ft|-1}} away.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=113}}  The bandits apparently held a condescending opinion of the Buffalo soldiers' fighting ability and thought they could be easily defeated.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=110}}  This likely played a part in the opening moments of the battle with the attackers firing mostly over the heads of the Buffalo Soldiers in an effort designed to scare them away.  It was not until the military escort began to provide a determined resistance that the attackers began to shoot directly at the soldiers.<ref name=\"WhamInterview\" />\n\nThe civilian driving the open wagon abandoned his vehicle as the gunfight began, fleeing to safety. Campbell's horse spooked at the sound of the weapons and threw her before it ran back toward the stagecoach station.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=113}}  The bandits called Campbell's name and fired a couple shots in her direction before turning their attention elsewhere.  Campbell then crawled behind a bush and some rocks located about {{convert|50|ft}} past the ambulance.  She observed the rest of the fight from this position.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=114}}\n\nThe soldiers, who had set their rifles down while preparing to move the boulder, quickly grabbed their weapons and ran for cover.<ref name=\"BattleWithBrigands\" /> Sgt. Brown and two privates were separated from the rest of the group and forced down the road.  After finding cover, Brown, even though wounded in his arm, fired his revolver at the bandits that had stood up.  After emptying his revolver, he took a rifle from one of the privates and continued the fight.  It was not until one of the two privates was wounded, and the sergeant shot a second time, that the three men retreated to a dry creek bed about {{convert|300|ft}} away.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=115}}\n\nMajor Wham initially took shelter behind the ambulance.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=114}}  The remaining draft animals panicked at the sound of the gunfire and dragged both wagons off the west side of the road, damaging their harnesses in the process.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|pp=112\u20133}}  This forced Wham to retreat behind a small rocky ledge on the west side of the road.  He was joined behind the outcropping by his clerk and most of the soldiers.  Wham directed the soldiers' fire while his clerk rendered aid to the wounded.  Both men, initially unarmed, later took rifles from wounded soldiers and joined in the fight.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=114}}  Mays initially returned fire with his revolver from behind the escort wagon.  This position soon proved to be untenable and he joined Wham behind the rocky ledge.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=116}}  While Wham and his men were pinned down there, the bandits maneuvered along the top of the ridge to get them into a crossfire.<ref name=\"FoughtNobly\"/> About 30 minutes after the battle began, Mays, who had assumed command of the escort following the withdrawal of Sergeant Brown, informed Wham that their position was no longer defensible and that he was ordering his men to withdraw.  Wham initially objected to this choice but later admitted that Mays had made the correct military decision.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=117}}\n\nFrom the rocky ledge, Wham and Mays withdrew to the nearby dry creek bed.  There Wham attempted to rally the soldiers to retake the lock box holding the payroll, but after seeing that eight of the eleven soldiers were wounded realized that was not a viable option.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|pp=117\u20138}}  With the soldiers located about {{convert|300|yd}} from their initial defensive position, the bandits continued to fire at them.  With the soldiers pinned down, several of the bandits descended the hill and opened the strongbox holding the payroll with an axe.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=118}}  About 2:30&nbsp;pm the bandits stopped firing and left in two groups.  The first group led a mule carrying what appeared to be a man slumped over it and the second group providing cover to the first.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=119}}\n\nIt was not until around 3:00&nbsp;pm that the soldiers returned to the ambulance and Campbell left her hiding place.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=119}}  They discovered the nine surviving mules had run off during the attack and their harnesses had been cut to pieces.<ref name=\"WhamInterview\" /> As the soldiers returned to the ambulance, Harriet Holladay arrived on the scene in her [[buckboard]].  She had heard the gunfire and decided to investigate when Campbell's riderless horse arrived at the station house.  Upon her arrival she joined with Campbell to provide first aid to the wounded soldiers.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=119}}  Four of the mules were located by the nearby creek bed and the soldiers were able to splice together enough of the harnesses to hitch them to the ambulance.<ref name=\"WhamInterview\" /> Most of the wounded were loaded into the ambulance for transport to Fort Thomas.  Sergeant Brown and one other man were deemed too severely injured to move and were tended by Campbell until the surgeon from Fort Thomas could be dispatched to retrieve them.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=120}}  As the convoy was preparing to leave, rancher Barney Norton, who had also heard the sounds of the battle, arrived with a group of his ranch hands.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=119}}  Wham arrived at Fort Thomas about 5:30&nbsp;pm.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=120}}\n\n==Investigation==\nBefore leaving the site of the attack, Wham conducted an initial investigation of the immediate area.  A valise containing the major's personal items, which had been stored in the strongbox, had been cut open but the robbers had left the contents undamaged.  A second valise, containing payroll receipts from his previous stops, had been taken along with the money.  An examination of the breastworks on top of the ridge found one of the fortifications contained over 200 spent rifle casings.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=119}}  Wham also arrested Campbell at the site of the attack, believing she had been somehow involved.  She was released a short time later and became an important witness for investigators.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=120}}\n\nAfter Wham arrived at Fort Thomas, a contingent of soldiers was sent to guard the scene of the attack until a complete sketch of the site could be completed.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=120}}  Troops stationed throughout southern Arizona Territory were also deployed in an effort to prevent the robbers from escaping into [[Mexico]].<ref name=\"BattleWithBrigands\" /> About 10&nbsp;am on May 12, [[Graham County, Arizona|Graham County]] Sheriff Billy Whelan, Sr., accompanied by several deputies and a group of Buffalo Soldiers, attempted to follow the bandits' trail.  Local lore claims the robbers fled southward until they passed through a herd of horses several miles from the attack site.  There they divided the loot and went in separate directions.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=120}}  The sheriff eventually found a trail leading toward the [[Gila River]] that led to the Follet Ranch.  The portion of the trail leading to the river appeared to have been made by horses that had had their horseshoes attached backwards.  The shoes were then removed at the river in further effort to confuse the trail.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=120-1}}  Additional trails leading to other ranches were discovered on May 13.  The Sheriff asked the residents of these ranches about their whereabouts on May 11.  \"The ranchers\", Deputy Billy Whelan, Jr. later described, \"hemmed and hawed and tried to make us think they were at other places. But the buffalo soldiers identified them.\"{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=121}}\n\nMeanwhile, the valise containing the payroll receipts was located about {{convert|1.5|mi}} from the ambush site with the pay stubs covered in blood.<ref name=\"WhamInterview\" /> Based upon this evidence and reports by Campbell and Wham's clerk that the bandits had carried away been what appeared to be a man's body on a mule, it was assumed that one or two of the attackers had been killed during the battle.  No body was ever discovered however, and no missing person reports for people living in the area were ever received by local authorities.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=121}}\n\nOn May 13, 1889, Governor [[Lewis Wolfley]] announced a $500 reward for the arrest and conviction of one or more of the bandits.<ref>{{cite news|title=Proclamation of Reward|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84021912/1889-06-01/ed-1/seq-2/#words=Paymaster+Wham&proxtext=wham+paymaster |newspaper=The Arizona Sentinel| location=Yuma, Arizona Territory | date=June 1, 1889 | page=2}}</ref> The [[United States Marshal]] for Arizona, [[William K.

Based upon the initial findings, Meade and Sheriff Whelan focused their investigation on the area around [[Pima, Arizona|Pima, Arizona Territory]].{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=121}}  Numerous arrests were made but most of the arrested men were soon released due to a lack of evidence.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=122}}\n\nReaction to events in the predominantly Mormon town of Pima was divided into two camps.  About half the town was generally cooperative with the investigation.  The other half viewed it as a return to federal persecution.  The wife of the owner of the Pima Hotel summarized this sentiment by saying, \"It's just following the usual pattern. From the time I first learned of the robbery I have expected nothing else than that it would be laid on to the Mormons.\"{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=123}}  The opposition even accused deputy marshals of planting gold coins found in the possession of prominent church members and making indiscriminate arrests in an effort to collect reward money.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=177}}\n\nMarshal Meade arrested M. E. Cunningham based upon information provided by Frankie Campbell.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=176}}  This was soon followed by the arrests of Ed Follett, Lyman Follett, Warren Follett, Thomas N. Lamb, David Rogers, Siebert Henderson, Gilbert Webb, and [[Wilfred T. Webb|Wilfred Webb]] on May 13.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=177}}{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=123}}  William Ellison \"Cyclone Bill\" Beck was also arrested soon after the robbery.  While waiting in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] for his [[alibi]] to be confirmed, Beck began drawing the attention of the locals.  Enough visitors came to see him that he began charging a fee for the viewings of \"the raw head and bloody bones of the Gila Valley\" and claimed he \"could make enough money to pay all my expenses in this damn trial.\"{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=122-3}} Beck's alibi was confirmed and he was released from custody.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=122}}  Henderson and Ed Follett were likewise released due to a lack of evidence.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=123}}  During a preliminary hearing before [[United States magistrate judge|Magistrate]] [[L. C. Hughes]], none of the others were able to provide an alibi and only Gilbert Webb was able to post bail.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=123-4}}\n\nThe suspected ringleader was Gilbert Webb, the serving Mayor of Pima and a leading member of the [[Graham County, Arizona|Graham County]] Democratic party.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=106}}  Within the Mormon community he was held in high regard by the community due to the jobs he provided through his various businesses.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=106}}  Non-Mormon neighbors of Gilbert Webb had a less generous view of the man, noting he had left Utah a decade earlier to avoid charges of grand larceny.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|pp=106\u20137}}  There was also a pattern of property disappearances that seemed to occur near places the Webb family had lived or worked.  During the six years preceding the robbery, Webb had experienced some financial setbacks that had forced him to close his store and sell his stagecoach line.  He had recently obtained a contract to provide straw and grain to Fort Thomas and San Carlos but may have lacked the needed financial resources to raise these crops.  Webb's lack of the short-term capital needed to meet his end of this contract was a possible motive for the robbery.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=107}}  While he was out on bail, Webb spent his time searching for witnesses willing to testify on behalf of him and his fellow defendants.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=124}}\n\nWhile most of the accused were not active members of the [[LDS Church]], they were all related to active church members and all considered to be outstanding members of the community.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=109}}\n\n==Trial==\n[[File:Wham Paymaster Robbery Defendants and Counsel.jpg|thumb|Defendants and defense counsel for the Wham Paymaster Robbery trial]]\n\nA U.S. Federal [[grand jury]] was convened in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in late September 1889.

Jeffords]] to call for the judge's removal.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=124}}  The grand jury members, concerned the judge's actions in court had intimidated some of the prosecution witnesses, sent a telegraph to the Department of Justice asking for a judge other than Judge Barnes to preside over the trial.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jury and Judges | date=October 5, 1889 |  newspaper=Arizona Silver Belt |location=Globe City, Arizona Territory | page=2 | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84021913/1889-10-05/ed-1/seq-2/#words=Paymaster+Wham&proxtext=wham+paymaster}}</ref>  The grand jury members were unaware that Barnes had already made arrangements for Judge [[John J. Hawkins]] to preside over the trial.  Upon learning of the telegram, Judge Barnes dismissed the Grand Jury, calling them \"a band of character assassins, unworthy to sit in any court of justice.\"{{sfn|McClintock|1916|p=472}}  A few days after the telegram was sent, President [[Benjamin Harrison]] appointed [[Richard E. Sloan]] to replace Judge Barnes.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=125}}\n\nPretrial shenanigans did not stop at the courtroom.  Three horses were shot and multiple head of cattle were stolen from the defendants and their friends.  Ed Follett was arrested for trying to intimidate a prosecution witness into changing his testimony.  Finally, the [[Solomonville, Arizona|Solomonville]] district court clerk, and former Graham County sheriff, Ben M. Crawford was forced to resign.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=125}}  He was later indicted for securing witnesses who gave false testimony in support of the defense.{{sfn|Wagoner|1970|p=315}}  These events set the scene for a tumultuous trial.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=126}}\n\nThe trial began in Tucson on November 11, 1889.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=126}}  U.S. Attorney Jeffords led the prosecution while [[Marcus Aurelius Smith|Mark Smith]] and Ben Goodrich led the defense.{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=31}}  There were 165 witnesses called during the trial, over half by the defense.{{sfn|McClintock|1916|p=472}}  During his testimony, Major Wham identified three of the defendants, Gilbert Webb, Warren Follett, and David Rodgers, as being among the attackers who performed the robbery.<ref name=\"LADH-18891116\">{{cite news|title=The Wham Robbers | date=November 16, 1889 |  newspaper=Los Angeles Daily Herald | page=3 | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042460/1889-11-16/ed-1/seq-3/#words=Paymaster+Wham&proxtext=wham+paymaster}}</ref> Wham also identified gold coins that had been deposited into a hotel safe by Gilbert Webb as being some of the stolen coins.{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=31}}  Identification of the coins was based upon unusual patterns of discolorations present upon the coins.<ref name=\"LADH-18891116\"/> During [[cross examination]], Smith challenged the identification of the coins by mixing in several coins from a local bank.  Wham was embarrassed by his inability to differentiate between the coins from the bank and those he claimed had come from the robbery.{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=31}}  Frankie Campbell also gave testimony.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=126}}  Smith vigorously cross examined each prosecution witnesses, leading many to admit that they had not had clear views of the attackers.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=178}}  Compounding difficulties for the prosecution were differences in the [[slang]] used by the black witnesses and the white jurors.  This, combined with a reluctance by many area residents to condemn a man based upon the word of a former slave, may have caused the jury to minimize the validity of the prosecution case.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=128}}\n\nThe defense provided a series of witness, described as \"brothers, sisters, cousins, and aunts of each other and the defendants,\" to provide alibis for the accused.  Due to the conflicting testimony provided by various witnesses, the defense took five hours for their closing arguments.  Smith used this time to play upon the biases and prejudices of the jury.{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=31}}  He argued that the robbers had dressed in a manner similar to his clients in order to misdirect suspicion upon them and that the robbers had fled to Mexico immediately after the robbery.  Then he pointed out that U.S. Marshal Meade had failed to go to the scene of the attack to look for any trail left by the attackers.  Smith also claimed the government officials who arrested his clients were more interested in the reward money for capturing the robbers than in finding the people who actually committed the crime.{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=32}}  When Smith began to question the integrity of the Court, Judge Sloan threatened him with a $500 fine for [[Contempt of court|contempt]].{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=31-2}}\n\nThe jury deliberated for two hours before delivering a not guilty verdict.{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=32}}<ref>{{cite news|title=All Acquitted | date=December 16, 1889 |  newspaper=Sacramento Daily Record-Union  | page=1 | url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82014381/1889-12-16/ed-1/seq-1/#words=Major+Wham&proxtext=major+wham}}</ref>  Deputy William \"Billy\" Breakenridge noted after the trial, \"the Government had a good case against them [the robbers], but they had too many friends willing to swear to an alibi, and there were too many on the jury who thought it no harm to rob the Government.\"{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=178}}\n\n==Later events==\n[[File:Isaiah Mays.jpg|thumb|upright|Isaiah Mays with a Medal of Honor]]\n\nGeneral reaction to the verdict was one of shock and amazement.{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=32}}  In response to public reaction to the quick verdict, the jury issued a statement saying, \"We were present during the entire time of the trial, we heard everything that was said and saw everything that was done in the courtroom and heard nothing of what was being done and said outside, hence when we had agreed upon a verdict we did not know of anything to keep us in the jury room longer.\"{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=127}}  A misunderstanding of the [[jury instructions]] may have also played a role in the verdict.  The jury's understanding of the instructions was that they were required to find all of defendants guilty in order to convict and as they could not agree that all eight were involved they felt required to return a not guilty verdict.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=127}}\n\nU.S. Attorney Jeffords became seriously ill shortly after the trial and died several months later.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=130}}  Major Wham in turn was held responsible for the lost funds.  He was relieved of this debt on January 21, 1891, when the [[U.S. Congress]] passed an act relieving him of responsibility.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=129}}  Smith, who had ignored his duties as Territorial Delegate to take the case, was attacked politically for his involvement.{{sfn|Fazio|1970|p=32}}  This left the majority of the blame for the failed prosecution on U.S. Marshal Meade.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=178}}  Meade was replaced as U.S. Marshal on March 4, 1890.  His successor, Robert H. \"Bob\" Paul, adopted a watch and wait philosophy hoping a $500 reward offered by the Department of Justice at the urging of the War Department would lead to a resolution of the case.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=179}}  In August 1892, the Department of Justice asked the U.S. Attorney to investigate charges the jury had been bribed during the Wham trial.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=179}}\n\nIn recognition for their actions during the robbery, Sergeant [[Benjamin Brown (Medal of Honor)|Benjamin Brown]] and Corporal [[Isaiah Mays]] were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].  Additionally, Privates George Arrington, Benjamin Burge, Julius Harrington, Hamilton Lewis, Squire Williams, Jason Young, Thorton Hams, and Jason Wheeler were each awarded a [[Certificate of Merit]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015133/1891-07-18/ed-1/seq-1/#words=Isaiah+Mays+Wham&proxtext=Isaiah+Mays|newspaper=Arizona Weekly Citizen |location=Tucson, Arizona Territory |date= July 18, 1891 |title=Merit Rewarded | page=1}}</ref>\n\nLegal troubles for the accused did not end with their acquittal.  In May 1890, Mark E. Cunningham, Lyman Follett, and Warren Follett were arrested by [[Graham County, Arizona|Graham County]] officials on charges of [[cattle rustling]].  They were convicted of the charges and sentenced to two years in prison.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=179}}  An appeal of the conviction reached the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court, which granted them a new trial.  The prosecution dropped the charges before the second trial could convene.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=129}}  Meanwhile, Gilbert and Wilfred Webb were accused of defrauding the Graham County school district.{{sfn|Ball|1999|p=179}}  Wilfred Webb survived the accusations and later became active in territorial politics, serving as Speaker of the House during the [[23rd Arizona Territorial Legislature]] and as a member of Arizona's constitutional convention.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=129}}  When asked if he was involved in the robbery, he would respond with \"Twelve good men said I wasn't.\"{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=130}}  At the time of his death, Webb owned the 76 Ranch.  The ranch measured {{convert|20|by|50|mi}} and included all of Mount Graham.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=130}}  The money taken during the robbery has never been recovered.{{sfn|Upton|Ball|1997|p=131}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Ball |first=Larry D. |title=The United States Marshals of New Mexico and Arizona Territories, 1846\u20131912 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |location=Albuquerque |year=1999 |orig-year=1978 |isbn=0-8263-0617-9 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a-BpeliOL0AC&pg=PA178 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite journal | last = Fazio | first = Steven A. | title = Marcus Aurelius Smith: Arizona Delegate and Senator |journal = Arizona and the West |volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 23\u201362 | date = Spring 1970 | jstor = 40168029 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last =McClintock | first = James H. | author-link = James H.

It is located next to [[Southsea Hoverport]]. Unlike most seaside piers in the UK, the pier does not extend very far out to sea and instead goes ''along'' the coast.\n\nThe pier was originally constructed and opened in 1861 by the Prince and Princess of Wales<ref>http://strongisland.co/2009/03/19/the-history-of-clarence-pier/</ref> and boasted a regular ferry service to the [[Isle of Wight]]. It was damaged by air raids during [[World War II]] and was reopened in its current form on 1 June 1961 after being rebuilt by local architects [[A. E. Cogswell|A.E. Cogswell & Sons]] and R. Lewis Reynish.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=UjoiDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT90&lpg=PT90&dq=AE+Cogswell+%26+Sons#v=onepage&q=AE%20Cogswell%20%26%20Sons&f=false |title = Pier Review: A Road Trip in Search of the Great British Seaside|isbn = 9781783727513|last1 = Bounds|first1 = Jon|last2 = Smith|first2 = Danny|date = 11 February 2016}}</ref><ref>http://strongisland.co/2009/03/19/the-history-of-clarence-pier/</ref>\n\nThe main entrance to the pier from the road is via a striking pavilion building with distinctive yellow and blue cladding and a small tower. This originally housed an amusement arcade and cafe although in more recent years, the upper floor has variously been used for \"Pirate Pete's\" indoor children's playground, a [[Wimpy (brand)|Wimpy]] bar while the 'Golden Horseshoe' amusement arcade and Coffee Cup (originally a prize bingo hall) remain on the ground floor.\n\nA smaller building, perpendicular but not physically joined to the main pavilion houses another amusement arcade, the \"Clarence Pier\" (Originally called \"Wheel Of Fortune\") and some small gift shops. The upper floor was originally used as a public house, but it was later converted into 'Jurassic 3001', a futuristic dinosaur themed dark ride, which opened in 1995. The ride's exterior featured an animatronic triceratops, whose head protruded from the side of the building and roared occasionally at passers-by. The attraction closed in 2001, yet all ride signage and theming on the building remained until the end of 2011. The upper floor space previously occupied by this ride underwent a conversion to apartments, according to planning publications, in 2012.\n\nA building at the side of the funfair houses an arcade called \"Games Wharf\" and \"The Boat House\" (originally another Coffee Cup).\n\nThe main funfair operates on a free admission, pay-per-ride token-based system. In the early 1980s, the amusement park was named \"Fun Acres\" and as well as the whole pier itself, it also took up 3500 sq metres of land or so to the north-west of the northern part of the pier. This part of the park was cleared and redeveloped as another arcade called \"Southsea Island Leisure\", The Clarence Pier Public House, a crazy golf course and a [[Premier Inn]] during the 1990s, therefore the park itself is significantly smaller than it used to be. The old part of the park contained the 56-seat Corbiere Spherical Ferris Wheel<ref>[http://www.richardswheel.com/index.html Richard's Big wheel]</ref> and a [[Dark ride|ghost train]] among other attractions. The token booths were shaped as mushrooms.\n[[File:Clarence Pier as viewed from gosport.JPG|thumb|right|The pier viewed from gosport]]\n[[File:St Clarence Pier Portsmouth June 2018.jpg|thumb|Clarence Pier Portsmouth June 2018|200px]]\nOne of the main landmarks of Clarence Pier until the mid-1990s was the Super Loop ride, since removed. The [[Ferris wheel]] was sold and relocated to [[Pleasureland Southport]].<ref>[http://www.ukrides.info/pleasureferris.htm Ferris wheel]</ref> One ride which lasted the duration and remains to this day is the Skyways [[roller coaster]]. A new addition to the pier is a pirate-themed crazy golf course situated behind the Clarence Pier arcade.\n\n\"[[Mind the Baby, Mr. Bean]]\", an episode of British TV comedy series \"[[Mr. Bean]]\" was filmed on location at Clarence Pier (as well as other locations in [[Southsea]]) and aired on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1994. This was prior to the closure of the north-western part of the park and the closure of the Wheel Of Fortune public house. The episode shows the Super Loop, Skyways roller coaster, and many of the park's other attractions from that time. Clarence Pier was also the filming location to the teen pop band, \"S Club Juniors\" song, \"Fool No More\" filmed mainly on the dodgems but the rollercoaster, 'Skyways' can also be seen in the video.\n\n==Attractions==\n\n;Key\n:{{Color box|lightblue|border=darkgray}} Roller Coasters\n:{{Color box|yellow|border=darkgray}} Water Rides\n:{{Color box|lightgreen|border=darkgray}} Dark Rides\n\n===Operating===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It is located next to [[Southsea Hoverport]]. Unlike most seaside piers in the UK, the pier does not extend very far out to sea and instead goes ''along'' the coast.\n\nThe pier was originally constructed and opened in 1861 by the Prince and Princess of Wales<ref>http://strongisland.co/2009/03/19/the-history-of-clarence-pier/</ref> and boasted a regular ferry service to the [[Isle of Wight]]. It was damaged by air raids during [[World War II]] and was reopened in its current form on 1 June 1961 after being rebuilt by local architects [[A. E. Cogswell|A.E. Cogswell & Sons]] and R. Lewis Reynish.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=UjoiDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT90&lpg=PT90&dq=AE+Cogswell+%26+Sons#v=onepage&q=AE%20Cogswell%20%26%20Sons&f=false |title = Pier Review: A Road Trip in Search of the Great British Seaside|isbn = 9781783727513|last1 = Bounds|first1 = Jon|last2 = Smith|first2 = Danny|date = 11 February 2016}}</ref><ref>http://strongisland.co/2009/03/19/the-history-of-clarence-pier/</ref>\n\nThe main entrance to the pier from the road is via a striking pavilion building with distinctive yellow and blue cladding and a small tower. This originally housed an amusement arcade and cafe although in more recent years, the upper floor has variously been used for \"Pirate Pete's\" indoor children's playground, a [[Wimpy (brand)|Wimpy]] bar while the 'Golden Horseshoe' amusement arcade and Coffee Cup (originally a prize bingo hall) remain on the ground floor.\n\nA smaller building, perpendicular but not physically joined to the main pavilion houses another amusement arcade, the \"Clarence Pier\" (Originally called \"Wheel Of Fortune\") and some small gift shops. The upper floor was originally used as a public house, but it was later converted into 'Jurassic 3001', a futuristic dinosaur themed dark ride, which opened in 1995. The ride's exterior featured an animatronic triceratops, whose head protruded from the side of the building and roared occasionally at passers-by. The attraction closed in 2001, yet all ride signage and theming on the building remained until the end of 2011. The upper floor space previously occupied by this ride underwent a conversion to apartments, according to planning publications, in 2012.\n\nA building at the side of the funfair houses an arcade called \"Games Wharf\" and \"The Boat House\" (originally another Coffee Cup).\n\nThe main funfair operates on a free admission, pay-per-ride token-based system. In the early 1980s, the amusement park was named \"Fun Acres\" and as well as the whole pier itself, it also took up 3500 sq metres of land or so to the north-west of the northern part of the pier. This part of the park was cleared and redeveloped as another arcade called \"Southsea Island Leisure\", The Clarence Pier Public House, a crazy golf course and a [[Premier Inn]] during the 1990s, therefore the park itself is significantly smaller than it used to be. The old part of the park contained the 56-seat Corbiere Spherical Ferris Wheel<ref>[http://www.richardswheel.com/index.html Richard's Big wheel]</ref> and a [[Dark ride|ghost train]] among other attractions. The token booths were shaped as mushrooms.\n[[File:Clarence Pier as viewed from gosport.JPG|thumb|right|The pier viewed from gosport]]\n[[File:St Clarence Pier Portsmouth June 2018.jpg|thumb|Clarence Pier Portsmouth June 2018|200px]]\nOne of the main landmarks of Clarence Pier until the mid-1990s was the Super Loop ride, since removed. The [[Ferris wheel]] was sold and relocated to [[Pleasureland Southport]].<ref>[http://www.ukrides.info/pleasureferris.htm Ferris wheel]</ref> One ride which lasted the duration and remains to this day is the Skyways [[roller coaster]]. A new addition to the pier is a pirate-themed crazy golf course situated behind the Clarence Pier arcade.\n\n\"[[Mind the Baby, Mr. Bean]]\", an episode of British TV comedy series \"[[Mr. Bean]]\" was filmed on location at Clarence Pier (as well as other locations in [[Southsea]]) and aired on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1994. This was prior to the closure of the north-western part of the park and the closure of the Wheel Of Fortune public house. The episode shows the Super Loop, Skyways roller coaster, and many of the park's other attractions from that time. Clarence Pier was also the filming location to the teen pop band, \"S Club Juniors\" song, \"Fool No More\" filmed mainly on the dodgems but the rollercoaster, 'Skyways' can also be seen in the video.\n\n==Attractions==\n\n;Key\n:{{Color box|lightblue|border=darkgray}} Roller Coasters\n:{{Color box|yellow|border=darkgray}} Water Rides\n:{{Color box|lightgreen|border=darkgray}} Dark Rides\n\n===Operating===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The island was Christianised from the 5th century onward. Following the 12th century [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th\u201317th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much [[The Troubles|civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s]]. This subsided following [[Good Friday Agreement|a political agreement]] in 1998. In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the [[European Economic Community]] while the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, as part of it, did the same.\n\n[[Irish culture]] has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of [[Irish literature|literature]].

This theory draws on the ''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]'', a medieval Christian pseudo-history of Ireland along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artifacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze spears, shields, torcs and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The [[Priteni]] were said to be the first, followed by the [[Belgae]] from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, Laighin tribes from Armorica (present-day Brittany) were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] ([[Gaels]]) were said to have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul.<ref>''The Celts: A History'', by D\u00e1ith\u00ed \u00d3 h\u00d3g\u00e1in</ref> It was claimed that a second wave named the Euerni, belonging to the Belgae people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the sixth century BC.

Historical linguists are skeptical that this method alone could account for the absorption of Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processional view of Celtic linguistic formation is 'an especially hazardous exercise'.<ref>{{cite book |last=Waddell |first=John |title=Ireland in the Bronze Age |publisher=Irish Government Stationery Office |date=April 1995 |location=Dublin |pages= |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celts.pdf |archive-date=19 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319230912/http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celts.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Waddell |first=John |title=The Question of the Celticization of Ireland |publisher=Emania |date=September 1992 |pages= |url=http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celticization_of_ire.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721151900/http://www.nuigalway.ie/archaeology/oldsite/documents/jw_celticization_of_ire.pdf |archive-date=21 July 2015}}</ref> Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to Ireland has led to findings that showed no significant differences in [[mitochondrial DNA]] between Ireland and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y-chromosome pattern.

Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of the [[Magna Carta]] (the [[Great Charter of Ireland]]), substituting ''Dublin'' for ''London'' and the ''Irish Church'' for, the English church at the time, the ''Catholic Church'', was published in 1216 and the [[Parliament of Ireland]] was founded in 1297.\n\nFrom the mid-14th century, after the [[Black Death]], Norman settlements in Ireland went into a period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the [[Parliament of Ireland#Middle Ages|Irish parliament]] passed the [[Statutes of Kilkenny]] in 1367.

[[George III of the United Kingdom|George's father]] had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing [[Catholic Emancipation]] to be in conflict with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].\n\nDaniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or \"[[Irish Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]]\". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=376\u2013400 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}</ref> After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914.

The Act was passed but with the \"temporary\" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster that would become Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under [[John Redmond]], took the name [[National Volunteers]] and supported [[Ireland and World War I|Irish involvement]] in the war.

F. Foster (historian)|R. F. Foster]]  argues the cause was a combination of a new sense of initiative and the entry of American corporations. He concludes the chief factors were low taxation, pro-business regulatory policies, and a young, tech-savvy workforce. For many multinationals the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the [[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]. In addition [[European Union]] membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.<ref>R.

The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion, and divorce undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the pedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.<ref>Foster, ''Luck and the Irish'' pp 37-66.</ref>\n\nThe [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial crisis]] that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom.

Overall, Ireland has a mild but changeable [[oceanic climate]] with few extremes. The climate is typically insular and is [[Temperate climate|temperate]], avoiding the extremes in temperature of many other areas in the world at similar latitudes.<ref name=\"MEclimate\">{{cite web |title=Climate of Ireland |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met \u00c9ireann}}|url= http://www.met.ie/climate/climate-of-ireland.asp |access-date=11 November 2008}}</ref> This is a result of the moderating moist winds which ordinarily prevail from the southwestern Atlantic.\n\nPrecipitation falls throughout the year but is light overall, particularly in the east. The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail. The regions of north County Galway and east County Mayo have the highest incidents of recorded lightning annually for the island, with lightning occurring approximately five to ten days per year in these areas.<ref name=\"MErainfall\">{{cite web |title=Rainfall |website=Climate |publisher={{lang|ga|Met \u00c9ireann}} |url= http://www.met.ie/climate/rainfall.asp |access-date=5 November 2008}}</ref> [[Munster]], in the south, records the least snow whereas [[Ulster]], in the north, records the most.\n\nInland areas are warmer in summer and colder in winter.

Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as a refuge for native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.<ref name=\"cap_reforms\">{{cite web |title=CAP Reform \u2013 A Long-term Perspective for Sustainable Agriculture |website=Agriculture and Rural Development |publisher=European Commission |url= http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/cap-post-2013/index_en.htm |access-date=30 July 2007}}</ref> 32% of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions are correlated to agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.ie/irelandsenvironment/climate/|title=Climate Change Causes|date=2014|publisher=[[Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland)]]|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nForested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates.

Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the [[Iron Age]]. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx Language|Manx]] languages respectively.\n\nThe Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into [[Old Irish]] from the 6th to 10th century, [[Middle Irish]] from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[Anglo-Norman language|French]] and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.\n\nThe [[Gaelic Revival]] of the early 20th century has had a long-term influence. Irish is taught in mainstream Irish schools as a compulsory subject, but teaching methods have been criticised for their ineffectiveness, with the lack of level of ability after, typically, fourteen years of instruction cited.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://universitytimes.ie/?p=1707 |title=Head-to-Head: The Irish Language Debate |work=UniversityTimes.ie |date=21 February 2011 |access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast.

Poetry in Irish is among the oldest [[vernacular literature|vernacular poetry]] in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.\nIrish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include {{lang|ga|[[Gofraidh Fionn \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]]}} (fourteenth century), {{lang|ga|[[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Bruadair]]}} (seventeenth century) and [[Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille]] (eighteenth century). {{lang|ga|[[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]]}} (c. 1743 \u2013 c. 1800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the [[Gaelic revival]], which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1ire Mhac an tSaoi]]}} and others. Irish-language publishers such as {{lang|ga|[[Coisc\u00e9im]]}} and {{lang|ga|[[Cl\u00f3 Iar-Chonnacht]]}} continue to produce scores of titles every year.\n\nIn English, [[Jonathan Swift]], often called the foremost [[satirist]] in the English language, gained fame for works such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[A Modest Proposal]]''. Other notable 18th-century writers of Irish origin included [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo\u2013Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as [[Charles Kickham]], [[William Carleton]], and (in collaboration) [[Edith Somerville]] and [[Violet Florence Martin]]. The playwright and poet [[Oscar Wilde]], noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.\n\nIn the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Although not a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[James Joyce]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is considered one of the most important works of [[Modernist literature]] and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as \"[[Bloomsday]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Bloomsday? |publisher=James Joyce Centre |url= http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140916080551/http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |archive-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> A comparable writer in Irish is {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, whose novel {{lang|ga|[[Cr\u00e9 na Cille]]}} is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.\n\nModern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage<ref>{{Cite book |first=Andrew |last=Higgins Wyndham |title=Re-imagining Ireland |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |date=2006}}</ref> through English-language writers such as [[John McGahern]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] and Irish-language writers such as {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Dire\u00e1in]]}} and others from the {{lang|ga|[[Gaeltacht]]}}.\n\n[[File:Revolutionary Joyce.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Joyce]] one of the most significant writers of the 20th century]]\n\n====Music====\nMusic has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times.<ref>O'Dwyer, Simon: ''Prehistoric Music in Ireland'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus Publishing, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3129-3}}.</ref> Although in the early Middle Ages the church was \"quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe\",<ref>Brannon, Patrick V.: \"Medieval Ireland: Music in Cathedral, Church and Cloister\", in: ''Early Music'' 28.2 (May 2000), p. 193.</ref> there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as [[Gregorian chant]]. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (''goltraige''), laughing music (''geantraige'') and sleeping music (''suantraige'').<ref>Buckley, Ann: \"Medieval Ireland, Music in\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', ed. by [[Harry White (musicologist)|Harry White]] and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-906359-78-2}}, p. 659.</ref> Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various [[string instrument]]s) was transmitted orally, but the [[Irish harp]], in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as [[Dublin Castle]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known [[List of Irish classical composers|Irish composers]] of this time belong to emigrants.\n\nIrish [[folk music|traditional music]] and [[dance]] has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music had fallen out of favour, especially in urban areas.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Geraghty |first=Des |title=Luke Kelly: A Memoir |publisher=Basement Press |date=1994 |pages=26\u201330 |isbn=978-1-85594-090-1}}</ref> However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as [[The Dubliners]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Wolfe Tones]], the [[Clancy Brothers]], [[Sweeney's Men]] and individuals like {{lang|ga|[[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada]]}} and [[Christy Moore]]. Groups and musicians including [[Horslips]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary [[rock music]] and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like [[Enya]], [[The Saw Doctors]], [[The Corrs]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[The Cranberries]] and [[The Pogues]] among others.\n\n====Art====\nThe earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as [[Newgrange]]<ref>{{Cite book |last1=O'Kelly |first1=Michael J. |last2=O'Kelly |first2=Claire |title=Newgrange: Archaeology Art and Legend |publisher=Thames and Hudson |date=1982 |location=London |url= https://books.google.com/?id=bGiMHQAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-500-27371-5}}</ref> and is traced through [[Bronze age]] artefacts and the religious carvings and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the medieval period.

The game has been played in an organised fashion in Ireland since the 1870s, with [[Cliftonville F.C.]] in Belfast being Ireland's oldest club. It was most popular, especially in its first decades, around Belfast and in Ulster. However, some clubs based outside Belfast thought that the IFA largely favoured Ulster-based clubs in such matters as selection for the national team. In 1921, following an incident in which, despite an earlier promise, the IFA moved an [[Irish Cup]] semi-final replay from Dublin to Belfast,<ref>{{cite web |title=FAI History: 1921\u20131930 |publisher=Football Association of Ireland |date=5 June 2009 |url= http://www.fai.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=222&Itemid=226 |access-date=30 December 2009}}</ref> Dublin-based clubs broke away to form the Football Association of the Irish Free State. Today the southern association is known as the [[Football Association of Ireland]] (FAI). Despite being initially blacklisted by the [[Home Nations]]' associations, the FAI was recognised by [[FIFA]] in 1923 and organised its first international fixture in 1926 (against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]). However, both the IFA and FAI continued to select their teams from the whole of Ireland, with some players earning international caps for matches with both teams. Both also referred to their respective teams as ''Ireland''.\n\n[[File:Paul O'Connell Ireland Rugby.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul O'Connell]] reaching for the ball during a [[Line-out (rugby union)|line out]] against [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] in 2007.]]\nIn 1950, FIFA directed the associations only to select players from within their respective territories and, in 1953, directed that the FAI's team be known only as \"[[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]]\" and that the IFA's team be known as \"[[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]\" (with certain exceptions). Northern Ireland qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] finals in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] (reaching the quarter-finals), [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]] and the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]].

The island was Christianised from the 5th century onward. Following the 12th century [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]], [[Kingdom of England|England]] claimed sovereignty. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th\u201317th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]], which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland saw much [[The Troubles|civil unrest from the late 1960s until the 1990s]]. This subsided following [[Good Friday Agreement|a political agreement]] in 1998. In 1973 the Republic of Ireland joined the [[European Economic Community]] while the United Kingdom, and Northern Ireland, as part of it, did the same.\n\n[[Irish culture]] has had a significant influence on other cultures, especially in the field of [[Irish literature|literature]].

After the passing of [[Test Act#1672 Act|the Test Act 1672]], and the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] over the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]]. Under the emerging [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]], Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional regressive punitive legislation followed in 1703, 1709 and 1728.

In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] and the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] to create a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].<ref name=\"Ward 1994 28\">{{cite book |last=Ward |first=Alan J. |title=The Irish Constitutional Tradition: Responsible Government and Modern Ireland, 1782\u20131992 |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |date=1994 |location=Washington, DC |page=28 |isbn=978-0-8132-0784-1}}</ref>\n\nThe passage of the Act in the Irish Parliament was ultimately achieved with substantial majorities, having failed on the first attempt in 1799.

The pre-eminent Irish political figure after the Union was [[Daniel O'Connell]]. He was elected as Member of Parliament for [[Ennis (UK Parliament constituency)|Ennis]] in a surprise result and despite being unable to take his seat [[The Test Act|as a Roman Catholic]]. O'Connell spearheaded a vigorous campaign that was taken up by the Prime Minister, the Irish-born soldier and statesman, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. Steering the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Relief Bill]] through Parliament, aided by future prime minister [[Robert Peel]], Wellington prevailed upon a reluctant [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] to sign the Bill and proclaim it into law. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George's father]] had opposed the plan of the earlier Prime Minister, [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt the Younger]], to introduce such a bill following the Union of 1801, fearing [[Catholic Emancipation]] to be in conflict with the [[Act of Settlement 1701]].\n\nDaniel O'Connell led a subsequent campaign, for the repeal of the Act of Union, which failed. Later in the century, [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and others campaigned for autonomy within the Union, or \"[[Irish Home Rule Bills|Home Rule]]\". Unionists, especially those located in Ulster, were strongly opposed to Home Rule, which they thought would be dominated by Catholic interests.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kee |first=Robert |title=The Green Flag: A History of Irish Nationalism |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |date=1972 |location=London |pages=376\u2013400 |isbn=978-0-297-17987-0}}</ref> After several attempts to pass a Home Rule bill through parliament, it looked certain that one would finally pass in 1914.

The Act was passed but with the \"temporary\" exclusion of the six counties of Ulster that would become Northern Ireland. Before it could be implemented, however, the Act was suspended for the duration of the [[World War I|First World War]]. The Irish Volunteers split into two groups. The majority, approximately 175,000 in number, under [[John Redmond]], took the name [[National Volunteers]] and supported [[Ireland and World War I|Irish involvement]] in the war.

For many multinationals the decision to do business in Ireland was made easier still by generous incentives from the [[IDA Ireland|Industrial Development Authority]]. In addition [[European Union]] membership was helpful, giving the country lucrative access to markets that it had previously reached only through the United Kingdom, and pumping huge subsidies and investment capital into the Irish economy.<ref>R.

The traditionally high levels of religiosity have sharply declined. Foster points to three factors: Irish feminism, largely imported from America with liberal stances on contraception, abortion, and divorce undermined the authority of bishops and priests. Second, the mishandling of the pedophile scandals humiliated the Church, whose bishops seemed less concerned with the victims and more concerned with covering up for errant priests. Third, prosperity brought hedonism and materialism that undercut the ideals of saintly poverty.<ref>Foster, ''Luck and the Irish'' pp 37-66.</ref>\n\nThe [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|financial crisis]] that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom.

Over time, the minority Catholic community felt increasingly alienated with further disaffection fuelled by practices such as [[gerrymandering]] and discrimination in housing and employment.<ref name=whyte>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/discrimination/whyte.htm |chapter=How much discrimination was there under the Unionist regime, 1921\u20131968? |last=Whyte |first=John |editor-first1=Tom |editor-last1=Gallagher |editor-first2=James |editor-last2=O'Connell |title=Contemporary Irish Studies |isbn=0-7190-0919-7 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |via=[[Conflict Archive on the Internet]] |year=1983 |access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/hmso/cmd380.htm |title=Fair Employment in Northern Ireland |isbn=0-10-103802-X |year= 1988 |access-date=23 October 2008 |author=Northern Ireland Office |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |via=Conflict Archive on the Internet|author-link=Northern Ireland Office }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/nicra/nicra78.htm |title='We Shall Overcome' ...

There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the [[Sunningdale Agreement]] of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the [[Good Friday Agreement]] was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.\n\nThe substance of the Agreement (formally referred to as the Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional [[Northern Ireland Executive|Executive]] drawn from the major parties in a new [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]] drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an [[Independent International Commission on Decommissioning|independent commission]] supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/decommission/iicd190106.pdf |first=Tauno |last=Nieminen |first2=John |last2=de Chastelain |author3=Andrew D.

They share an [[Irish border|open border]] and both are part of the [[Common Travel Area]].\n\nBoth the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are members of the [[European Union]], having both acceded to its precursor entity, the European Economic Community [EEC], in 1973, and as a consequence there is [[internal market|free movement of people, goods, services and capital]] across the border.\n\n===Republic of Ireland===\n[[File:\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in 2010.jpg|thumb|{{lang|ga|[[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]]}}, the official residence of the [[President of Ireland]]]]\nThe [[Republic of Ireland]] is a [[parliamentary democracy]] based on the British model, with a [[Constitution of Ireland|written constitution]] and a popularly elected president who has mostly ceremonial powers. The [[Government of Ireland|government]] is headed by a prime minister, the [[Taoiseach]], who is appointed by the [[President of Ireland|President]] on the nomination of the lower house of parliament, the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|''D\u00e1il'']].

The executive is jointly headed by the first and deputy first minister, with the ministries being allocated in proportion with each party's representation in the assembly. Its capital is [[Belfast]].\n\nUltimately political power is held by the [[UK government]], from which Northern Ireland has gone through intermittent periods of direct rule during which devolved powers have been suspended. Northern Ireland elects 18 of the UK [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]' 650 MPs. The [[Northern Ireland Secretary]] is a cabinet-level post in the British government.\n\nAlong with [[England and Wales]] and with Scotland, Northern Ireland forms one of the three separate legal jurisdictions of the UK, all of which share the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] as their court of final appeal.\n\n===All-island institutions===\nAs part of the Good Friday Agreement, the British and Irish governments agreed on the creation of all-island institutions and areas of cooperation. The [[North/South Ministerial Council]] is an institution through which ministers from the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive agree all-island policies. At least six of these policy areas must have an associated all-island \"implementation bodies,\" and at least six others must be implemented separately in each jurisdiction. The implementation bodies are: [[Waterways Ireland]], the [[Food Safety Promotion Board]], [[InterTradeIreland]], the [[Special European Union Programmes Body]], [[the North/South Language Body]] and the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights|Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission]].\n\nThe [[British\u2013Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] provides for co-operation between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom on all matters of mutual interest, especially Northern Ireland. In light of the Republic's particular interest in the governance of Northern Ireland, \"regular and frequent\" meetings co-chaired by the ROI Minister for Foreign Affairs and the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, dealing with non-devolved matters to do with Northern Ireland and non-devolved [[all-Ireland]] issues, are required to take place under the establishing treaty.\n\nThe [[North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association]] is a joint parliamentary forum for the island of Ireland. It has no formal powers but operates as a forum for discussing matters of common concern between the respective legislatures.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of the Republic of Ireland|Economy of Northern Ireland}}\n{{See also|International Financial Services Centre}}\nDespite the two jurisdictions using two distinct currencies (the [[euro]] and [[pound sterling]]), a growing amount of commercial activity is carried out on an all-Ireland basis.

The west tends to be wetter on average and prone to Atlantic storms, especially in the late autumn and winter months. These occasionally bring destructive winds and higher total rainfall to these areas, as well as sometimes snow and hail.

The population rebounded and multiplied over the next century, but the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of the 1840s caused one million deaths and forced over one million more to emigrate in its immediate wake. Over the following century, the population was reduced by over half, at a time when the general trend in European countries was for populations to rise by an average of three-fold.\n\nIreland's largest religious group is [[Christianity]].

A population of over 8 million in 1841 was reduced to slightly more than 4 million by 1921. In part, the fall in population was caused by death from the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] of 1845 to 1852, which took about 1 million lives.

Each language has produced noteworthy literature. Irish, though now only the language of a minority, was the vernacular of the Irish people for thousands of years and was possibly introduced during the [[Iron Age]]. It began to be written down after Christianisation in the 5th century and spread to Scotland and the Isle of Man, where it evolved into the [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Manx Language|Manx]] languages respectively.\n\nThe Irish language has a vast treasury of written texts from many centuries and is divided by linguists into [[Old Irish]] from the 6th to 10th century, [[Middle Irish]] from the 10th to 13th century, Early Modern Irish until the 17th century, and the Modern Irish spoken today. It remained the dominant language of Ireland for most of those periods, having influences from [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Old Norse]], [[Anglo-Norman language|French]] and English. It declined under British rule but remained the majority tongue until the early 19th century, and since then has been a minority language.\n\nThe [[Gaelic Revival]] of the early 20th century has had a long-term influence. Irish is taught in mainstream Irish schools as a compulsory subject, but teaching methods have been criticised for their ineffectiveness, with the lack of level of ability after, typically, fourteen years of instruction cited.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://universitytimes.ie/?p=1707 |title=Head-to-Head: The Irish Language Debate |work=UniversityTimes.ie |date=21 February 2011 |access-date=31 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere is now an extensive network of urban Irish speakers in both the Republic and Northern Ireland, especially in Dublin and Belfast.

These missions brought written language to an illiterate population of Europe during the Dark Ages that followed the [[fall of Rome]], earning Ireland the sobriquet, \"the island of saints and scholars\".\n\nSince the 20th century [[Irish pub]]s worldwide have become outposts of Irish culture, especially those with a full range of cultural and gastronomic offerings.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland's national theatre is the [[Abbey Theatre]], which was founded in 1904, and the national Irish-language theatre is {{lang|ga|[[An Taibhdhearc]]}}, which was established in 1928 in [[Galway]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Stair na Taibhdheirce |publisher={{lang|ga|An Taibhdheirce}} |date=2014 |url= http://antaibhdhearc.com/theatre-info/fuinn/ |access-date= 28 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=An Taibhdhearc |publisher=Fodor's |url= http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/ireland/county-clare-galway-and-the-aran-islands |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141002060446/http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/ireland/county-clare-galway-and-the-aran-islands/ |archive-date=2 October 2014}}</ref> Playwrights such as [[Se\u00e1n O'Casey]], [[Brian Friel]], [[Sebastian Barry]], [[Conor McPherson]] and [[Billy Roche]] are internationally renowned.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Houston |first=Eugenie |title=Working and Living in Ireland |publisher=Working and Living Publications |date=2001 |isbn=978-0-9536896-8-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/workinglivingini00euge/page/253 253] |url=https://archive.org/details/workinglivingini00euge/page/253 }}</ref>\n\n===Arts===\n{{Main|Music of Ireland|Irish dance|Irish literature|Irish art|Irish theatre}}\n\n[[File:KellsFol032vChristEnthroned.jpg|thumb|upright|Illuminated page from [[Book of Kells]]]]\n\n====Literature====\nIreland has made a large contribution to world literature in all its branches, both in Irish and English. Poetry in Irish is among the oldest [[vernacular literature|vernacular poetry]] in Europe, with the earliest examples dating from the 6th century.\nIrish remained the dominant literary language down to the nineteenth century, despite the spread of English from the seventeenth century on. Prominent names from the medieval period and later include {{lang|ga|[[Gofraidh Fionn \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh]]}} (fourteenth century), {{lang|ga|[[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Bruadair]]}} (seventeenth century) and [[Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille]] (eighteenth century). {{lang|ga|[[Eibhl\u00edn Dubh N\u00ed Chonaill]]}} (c. 1743 \u2013 c. 1800) was an outstanding poet in the oral tradition. The latter part of the nineteenth century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English. By 1900, however, cultural nationalists had begun the [[Gaelic revival]], which saw the beginnings of modern literature in Irish. This was to produce a number of notable writers, including {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1ire Mhac an tSaoi]]}} and others. Irish-language publishers such as {{lang|ga|[[Coisc\u00e9im]]}} and {{lang|ga|[[Cl\u00f3 Iar-Chonnacht]]}} continue to produce scores of titles every year.\n\nIn English, [[Jonathan Swift]], often called the foremost [[satirist]] in the English language, gained fame for works such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' and ''[[A Modest Proposal]]''. Other notable 18th-century writers of Irish origin included [[Oliver Goldsmith]] and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], though they spent most of their lives in England. The Anglo\u2013Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as [[Charles Kickham]], [[William Carleton]], and (in collaboration) [[Edith Somerville]] and [[Violet Florence Martin]]. The playwright and poet [[Oscar Wilde]], noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.\n\nIn the 20th century, Ireland produced four winners of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]: [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Seamus Heaney]]. Although not a [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[James Joyce]] is widely considered to be one of the most significant writers of the 20th century. Joyce's 1922 novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is considered one of the most important works of [[Modernist literature]] and his life is celebrated annually on 16 June in Dublin as \"[[Bloomsday]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=What is Bloomsday? |publisher=James Joyce Centre |url= http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140916080551/http://jamesjoyce.ie/what-is-bloomsday/ |archive-date=16 September 2014}}</ref> A comparable writer in Irish is {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Cadhain]]}}, whose novel {{lang|ga|[[Cr\u00e9 na Cille]]}} is regarded as a modernist masterpiece and has been translated into several languages.\n\nModern Irish literature is often connected with its rural heritage<ref>{{Cite book |first=Andrew |last=Higgins Wyndham |title=Re-imagining Ireland |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |date=2006}}</ref> through English-language writers such as [[John McGahern]] and [[Seamus Heaney]] and Irish-language writers such as {{lang|ga|[[M\u00e1irt\u00edn \u00d3 Dire\u00e1in]]}} and others from the {{lang|ga|[[Gaeltacht]]}}.\n\n[[File:Revolutionary Joyce.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Joyce]] one of the most significant writers of the 20th century]]\n\n====Music====\nMusic has been in evidence in Ireland since prehistoric times.<ref>O'Dwyer, Simon: ''Prehistoric Music in Ireland'' (Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus Publishing, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3129-3}}.</ref> Although in the early Middle Ages the church was \"quite unlike its counterpart in continental Europe\",<ref>Brannon, Patrick V.: \"Medieval Ireland: Music in Cathedral, Church and Cloister\", in: ''Early Music'' 28.2 (May 2000), p. 193.</ref> there was considerable interchange between monastic settlements in Ireland and the rest of Europe that contributed to what is known as [[Gregorian chant]]. Outside religious establishments, musical genres in early Gaelic Ireland are referred to as a triad of weeping music (''goltraige''), laughing music (''geantraige'') and sleeping music (''suantraige'').<ref>Buckley, Ann: \"Medieval Ireland, Music in\", in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', ed. by [[Harry White (musicologist)|Harry White]] and Barra Boydell (Dublin: UCD Press, 2013), {{ISBN|978-1-906359-78-2}}, p. 659.</ref> Vocal and instrumental music (e.g. for the harp, pipes, and various [[string instrument]]s) was transmitted orally, but the [[Irish harp]], in particular, was of such significance that it became Ireland's national symbol. Classical music following European models first developed in urban areas, in establishments of Anglo-Irish rule such as [[Dublin Castle]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] and [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin|Christ Church]] as well as the country houses of the Anglo-Irish ascendancy, with the first performance of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' (1742) being among the highlights of the baroque era. In the 19th century, public concerts provided access to classical music to all classes of society. Yet, for political and financial reasons Ireland has been too small to provide a living to many musicians, so the names of the better-known [[List of Irish classical composers|Irish composers]] of this time belong to emigrants.\n\nIrish [[folk music|traditional music]] and [[dance]] has seen a surge in popularity and global coverage since the 1960s. In the middle years of the 20th century, as Irish society was modernising, traditional music had fallen out of favour, especially in urban areas.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Geraghty |first=Des |title=Luke Kelly: A Memoir |publisher=Basement Press |date=1994 |pages=26\u201330 |isbn=978-1-85594-090-1}}</ref> However during the 1960s, there was a revival of interest in Irish traditional music led by groups such as [[The Dubliners]], [[The Chieftains]], [[The Wolfe Tones]], the [[Clancy Brothers]], [[Sweeney's Men]] and individuals like {{lang|ga|[[Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada]]}} and [[Christy Moore]]. Groups and musicians including [[Horslips]], [[Van Morrison]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] incorporated elements of Irish traditional music into contemporary [[rock music]] and, during the 1970s and 1980s, the distinction between traditional and rock musicians became blurred, with many individuals regularly crossing over between these styles of playing. This trend can be seen more recently in the work of artists like [[Enya]], [[The Saw Doctors]], [[The Corrs]], [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]], [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]], [[The Cranberries]] and [[The Pogues]] among others.\n\n====Art====\nThe earliest known Irish graphic art and sculpture are Neolithic carvings found at sites such as [[Newgrange]]<ref>{{Cite book |last1=O'Kelly |first1=Michael J. |last2=O'Kelly |first2=Claire |title=Newgrange: Archaeology Art and Legend |publisher=Thames and Hudson |date=1982 |location=London |url= https://books.google.com/?id=bGiMHQAACAAJ |isbn=978-0-500-27371-5}}</ref> and is traced through [[Bronze age]] artefacts and the religious carvings and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the medieval period.

Donegal Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, creating good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, [[Bundoran]] has hosted European championship surfing. [[Scuba diving]] is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the [[Church of Scotland]], St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]]. In England, 162 ancient churches and at least 24 hospitals were dedicated to him; though his only other surviving medieval dedication in Scotland is the parish church of [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]].<ref>Farmer 1978, p. 189.</ref><ref>Marshall 2009, p. 2.</ref> The church was first possessed by the monks of the [[Order of St Lazarus]], who ministered among lepers; if [[David I of Scotland|David I]] or [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] is the church's founder, the dedication may be connected to their sister [[Matilda of Scotland|Matilda]], who founded [[St Giles in the Fields]].<ref>Marshall 2009, pp. 3-4.</ref>\n\nPrior to the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], St Giles' was the only parish church in Edinburgh and some contemporary writers, such as [[Jean Froissart]], refer simply to the \"church of Edinburgh\".<ref>Jean Froissart in Lees 1889, p. 5.</ref><ref name=GMW103>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 103.</ref>  From its elevation to collegiate status in 1467 until the Reformation, the church's full title was \"the Collegiate Church of St Giles of Edinburgh\".<ref>Lees 1889, p. 43.</ref> Even after the Reformation, the church is attested as \"the college kirk of Sanct Geill\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 155\">Lees 1889, p. 155.</ref> The charter of 1633 raising St Giles' to a cathedral records its common name as \"Saint Giles' Kirk\".<ref name=\"Lees 1889, p. 204\">Lees 1889, p. 204.</ref>\n\nSt Giles' held cathedral status between 1633 and 1638 and again between 1661 and 1690 during periods of [[episcopacy]] within the [[Church of Scotland]].<ref name=GMW103/> Since 1690, the Church of Scotland, as a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church, has had no [[bishop]]s and, therefore, no [[cathedral]]s.

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the [[Church of Scotland]], St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].  Though chiefly associated with the [[Abbey of Saint-Gilles]] in modern-day [[France]], he was a popular saint in medieval [[Great Britain]].

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

He reluctantly agrees to act as a test subject for a drug that Magnus has secretly developed. On taking it for the first time, Dick finds that it enables him to enter into the landscape around him as it existed during the early [[14th century]]. He becomes drawn into the lives of the people he sees there and is soon addicted to the experience. Dick finds himself following Roger, who lives at Kilmarth, acts as steward to Sir Henry Champernoune, and is a secret admirer of the beautiful Isolda, wife of Sir Oliver Carminowe. She has been conducting a secret affair with the brother of Sir Henry's wife, Sir Otto Bodrugan, who is waylaid and killed by Oliver's men.\n\nEach visit corresponds to a key moment in the story of Isolda and Roger. Each time Dick returns to real time he is more confused; throughout the experience he is unable to interact with the couple. Any attempt to do so brings Dick crashing back to the present in a state of [[nausea|nauseated]] exhaustion. The drug has other dangers in that following Roger means that Dick walks unaware through the modern landscape with all the danger that entails.\n\nDick's wife, an American widow called Vita, and her young sons join him in Cornwall and are worried by his bizarre behaviour. It is made clear that Dick has no passionate feelings for his new wife, does not want the new job in the USA she has found for him and has no fatherly affection for her two boys\u2014which makes plausible his increasing desire to escape into the past. Magnus intends to join Dick, but is killed in what seems like a bizarre accident or suicide\u2014struck by a train whilst straying onto the local railway track. Dick knows the truth, that Magnus was under the influence of the drug; this makes the inquest difficult.\n\nDick's penultimate trip ends with him attempting to defend Isolda from Sir Henry's vindictive widow Joanna in the 14th century, but in reality attacking Vita. She and her children hide from him and he contacts a doctor who helps to wean him from his addiction to the drug. Dick explains the power of the drug, and is informed by the doctor that analysis has revealed its extremely dangerous nature. However, Dick's addiction is such that he takes the last remaining dose soon after.\n\nDick's last visit occurs during the [[Black Death]] in 1349. A dying Roger confesses his love for Isolda and the fact that she died peacefully from a drug he administered rather than from the plague. After the death of his [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] Roger and the Isolda they both loved, Dick has little incentive to return to the other world, but in any case there is no drug left to allow his passage there. As the book closes, Dick attempts to pick up the phone but suddenly finds he is unable to grip it. Speaking of the novel's unresolved ending, Daphne du Maurier said in an interview: \"What about the hero of ''The House on the Strand''?
