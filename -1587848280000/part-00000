Downes chose a repertoire that ranged from traditional [[Celtic music|Celtic tunes]] to modern songs.\n\nThe show was meant to be a one-time event held in [[Dublin]], Ireland, but multiple airings on [[PBS]] helped boost the group's popularity.\n\nThe group's line-up has changed over the years. Eleven albums have been released under the name \"Celtic Woman\": ''[[Celtic Woman (album)|Celtic Woman]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: A Christmas Celebration]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: A New Journey]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: The Greatest Journey]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Songs from the Heart]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Lullaby]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Believe]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Home for Christmas]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Emerald - Musical Gems]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Destiny]]'', ''[[Celtic Woman: Voices of Angels]],'' and ''[[Celtic Woman: Ancient Land]].''

{"title_page": "Interregnum (England)", "text_new": "{{short description|Period between the execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649 and the start of the Restoration}}\n{{Periods in English History}}\nThe '''Interregnum'''  was the period between the [[execution of Charles I]] on 30 January 1649 and the arrival of his son [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in London on 29 May 1660 which marked the start of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]. During the Interregnum, England was under various forms of republican government (see [[Commonwealth of England]]; this article describes other facets of the Interregnum).\n\nThe politics of the period were dominated by the wishes of the  (Senior Officers) of the  and their civilian supporters. They encouraged (or at least tolerated) several republican regimes.\n\nFrom 1649 until 1653 executive powers lay with , while legislative functions were carried out by the .\n\nIn 1653 the Grandees, with  in the lead, dismissed the Rump, and replaced it with a Nominated Assembly (nicknamed the Parliament of Saints and ) made up of 140 nominees, 129 from England and Wales, five from Scotland and six from Ireland.

This ushered in a period of unstable government, which did not come to an end until February 1660 when General , the English military governor of Scotland, marched to London at the head of his troops, and oversaw the  under Charles II.\n\n==Life during the Interregnum==\nAfter the Parliamentarian victory in the Civil War, the [[Puritan]] views of the majority of Parliament and its supporters began to be imposed on the rest of the country. The Puritans advocated an austere lifestyle and restricted what they saw as the excesses of the previous regime. Most prominently, holidays such as Christmas and Easter were suppressed.{{sfn|Durston|1985}} Pastimes such as the theatre and gambling were also banned. However, some forms of art that were thought to be \"virtuous\", such as opera, were encouraged. These changes are often credited to [[Oliver Cromwell]], though they were introduced by the Commonwealth Parliament; and Cromwell, when he came to power, was a liberalising influence.<ref>''Cromwell, Our Chief of Men'' by [[Lady Antonia Fraser]], {{ISBN|0-7538-1331-9}}.</ref>\n\n==Jews in England==\n{{Main|Resettlement of the Jews in England}}\n\n[[Rabbi]] [[Menasseh Ben Israel]] met Oliver Cromwell in 1655 in order to discuss the admission of Jews into England.<ref>[http://www.olivercromwell.org/jews.htm \"Cromwell and the Jews\"], The Oliver Cromwell Association.</ref> Cromwell did not agree to all the rights that Ben Israel requested, but the opening of Jewish [[synagogues]] and [[burial ground]]s was tolerated under Cromwell's Protectorate. The Jewish faith was still not practised openly in England, since Cromwell's move had been controversial and many in England were still hostile toward Jews. Life for [[Jews in England]] improved in that they could no longer be [[prosecute]]d if caught worshipping, yet [[discrimination]] continued.\n\n== Radicals vs conservatives ==\nParliament had, to a large degree, encouraged the radical political groups which emerged when the usual social controls broke down during the [[English Civil War]]. It had also unwittingly established a new political force when it set up the [[New Model Army]]. Not surprisingly, all these groups had their own hopes for the new Commonwealth.\n\n=== Levellers ===\nLed by [[John Lilburne]], [[Levellers]] drew their main support from London and the Army. In the [[Agreement of the People]], 1649, they asked for a more representative and accountable parliament, to meet every two years; a reform of law so it would be available to and fair to all; and religious toleration. They wanted a more [[democracy|democratic]] society, although their proposed franchise did not extend to women or to the lowest orders of society.\n\nLevellers saw the Rump as little better than the monarchy it had replaced, and they showed their displeasure in demonstrations, pamphlets and mutinies. While their numbers did not pose a serious threat to the government, they scared the Rump into action and a [[Treasons Act 1649|Treasons Act]] was passed against them in 1649.\n\n=== Diggers ===\nLed by [[Gerrard Winstanley]], [[Diggers]] wanted an even more equal society than the Levellers. They advocated a lifestyle that bore many similarities to later understandings of [[communism]] and [[anarchism]], with communal ownership of land, and absolute equality for males and females in law and education. They existed in only very small numbers and faced a very strong opposition, even from the Levellers.\n\n=== Religious sects ===\n{{see also|Religion during the Interregnum}}\n\nThe breakdown of religious uniformity and incomplete [[Presbyterian]] Settlement of 1646 enabled independent churches to flourish. The main sects (''see also [[English Dissenters]]'') were [[Baptists]], who advocated adult re[[baptism]]; [[Ranters]], who claimed that sin did not exist for the \"chosen ones\"; and [[Fifth Monarchy Men]], who opposed all \"earthly\" governments, believing they must prepare for God's kingdom on earth by establishing a \"government of saints\".\n\nDespite greater toleration, extreme sects were opposed by the upper classes as they were seen as a threat to social order and property rights.\n[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] were also excluded from the toleration applied to the other groups.\n\n=== Conservatives ===\nConservatives were still dominant in both [[central government]] and [[local government]]. In the former, the Rump was anxious not to offend the traditional ruling class whose support it needed for survival, so it opposed radical ideas. In the latter, that ruling class dominated through the influence of traditional regional gentry.\n\n==Historical analysis==\nThe Interregnum was a relatively short but important period in the history of the British Isles. It saw a number of political experiments without any stable form of government emerging, largely due to the wide diversity in religious and political groups that had been allowed to flourish after the [[regicide]] of Charles I.\n\nThe [[Puritan]] movement had evolved as a rejection of both real and perceived \"Catholicisation\" of the [[Church of England]].  When the Church of England was quickly [[Established church#Disestablishment|disestablished]] by the Commonwealth Government, the question of what church to establish became a hotly debated subject. In the end, it was impossible to make all the political factions happy. During the Interregnum, Oliver Cromwell lost much of the support he had gained during the Civil War. [[Edward Sexby]], previously a supporter of Cromwell's, felt disenfranchised by Cromwell's failure to abolish the [[aristocracy]]. In 1657, [[Silius Titus]] called for Cromwell's assassination in a co-authored pamphlet ''[[Killing No Murder]]'' under the pseudonym of William Allen. Sexby was captured when he returned to England and attempted to carry out the assassination described in Colonel Titus' book. Cromwell coerced Sexby into confessing authorship of the pamphlet and then imprisoned him in the [[Tower of London]], where Sexby was driven to insanity, dying there less than a year later.\n\nHigh taxes required by the large [[standing army]], kept due to the constant threats of Scottish and Irish rebellion, added to public resentment of Cromwell.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation |last=Durston |first=Chris |year=1985  |chapter=Lords of Misrule: The Puritan War on Christmas 1642-60 |title= History Today |publisher=History Today Ltd |url=http://www.historytoday.com/chris-durston/lords-misrule-puritan-war-christmas-1642-60 |volume=35| issue=12}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[Category:1650s in England]]\n[[Category:English Civil War]]\n[[Category:Interregnum (England)| ]]\n[[Category:Oliver Cromwell]]\n[[Category:Republicanism in England]]\n[[Category:Stuart England]]\n[[Category:1649 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Interregnum (1649\u20131660)]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Period between the execution of Charles I on 30 January 1649 and the start of the Restoration}}\n{{Periods in English History}}\nThe '''Interregnum'''  was the period between the [[execution of Charles I]] on 30 January 1649 and the arrival of his son [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in London on 29 May 1660 which marked the start of the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]].

Most prominently, holidays such as Christmas and Easter were suppressed.{{sfn|Durston|1985}} Pastimes such as the theatre and gambling were also banned. However, some forms of art that were thought to be \"virtuous\", such as opera, were encouraged. These changes are often credited to [[Oliver Cromwell]], though they were introduced by the Commonwealth Parliament; and Cromwell, when he came to power, was a liberalising influence.<ref>''Cromwell, Our Chief of Men'' by [[Lady Antonia Fraser]], {{ISBN|0-7538-1331-9}}.</ref>\n\n==Jews in England==\n{{Main|Resettlement of the Jews in England}}\n\n[[Rabbi]] [[Menasseh Ben Israel]] met Oliver Cromwell in 1655 in order to discuss the admission of Jews into England.<ref>[http://www.olivercromwell.org/jews.htm \"Cromwell and the Jews\"], The Oliver Cromwell Association.</ref> Cromwell did not agree to all the rights that Ben Israel requested, but the opening of Jewish [[synagogues]] and [[burial ground]]s was tolerated under Cromwell's Protectorate. The Jewish faith was still not practised openly in England, since Cromwell's move had been controversial and many in England were still hostile toward Jews. Life for [[Jews in England]] improved in that they could no longer be [[prosecute]]d if caught worshipping, yet [[discrimination]] continued.\n\n== Radicals vs conservatives ==\nParliament had, to a large degree, encouraged the radical political groups which emerged when the usual social controls broke down during the [[English Civil War]]. It had also unwittingly established a new political force when it set up the [[New Model Army]]. Not surprisingly, all these groups had their own hopes for the new Commonwealth.\n\n=== Levellers ===\nLed by [[John Lilburne]], [[Levellers]] drew their main support from London and the Army. In the [[Agreement of the People]], 1649, they asked for a more representative and accountable parliament, to meet every two years; a reform of law so it would be available to and fair to all; and religious toleration. They wanted a more [[democracy|democratic]] society, although their proposed franchise did not extend to women or to the lowest orders of society.\n\nLevellers saw the Rump as little better than the monarchy it had replaced, and they showed their displeasure in demonstrations, pamphlets and mutinies. While their numbers did not pose a serious threat to the government, they scared the Rump into action and a [[Treasons Act 1649|Treasons Act]] was passed against them in 1649.\n\n=== Diggers ===\nLed by [[Gerrard Winstanley]], [[Diggers]] wanted an even more equal society than the Levellers. They advocated a lifestyle that bore many similarities to later understandings of [[communism]] and [[anarchism]], with communal ownership of land, and absolute equality for males and females in law and education. They existed in only very small numbers and faced a very strong opposition, even from the Levellers.\n\n=== Religious sects ===\n{{see also|Religion during the Interregnum}}\n\nThe breakdown of religious uniformity and incomplete [[Presbyterian]] Settlement of 1646 enabled independent churches to flourish. The main sects (''see also [[English Dissenters]]'') were [[Baptists]], who advocated adult re[[baptism]]; [[Ranters]], who claimed that sin did not exist for the \"chosen ones\"; and [[Fifth Monarchy Men]], who opposed all \"earthly\" governments, believing they must prepare for God's kingdom on earth by establishing a \"government of saints\".\n\nDespite greater toleration, extreme sects were opposed by the upper classes as they were seen as a threat to social order and property rights.\n[[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] were also excluded from the toleration applied to the other groups.\n\n=== Conservatives ===\nConservatives were still dominant in both [[central government]] and [[local government]]. In the former, the Rump was anxious not to offend the traditional ruling class whose support it needed for survival, so it opposed radical ideas. In the latter, that ruling class dominated through the influence of traditional regional gentry.\n\n==Historical analysis==\nThe Interregnum was a relatively short but important period in the history of the British Isles. It saw a number of political experiments without any stable form of government emerging, largely due to the wide diversity in religious and political groups that had been allowed to flourish after the [[regicide]] of Charles I.\n\nThe [[Puritan]] movement had evolved as a rejection of both real and perceived \"Catholicisation\" of the [[Church of England]].  When the Church of England was quickly [[Established church#Disestablishment|disestablished]] by the Commonwealth Government, the question of what church to establish became a hotly debated subject. In the end, it was impossible to make all the political factions happy. During the Interregnum, Oliver Cromwell lost much of the support he had gained during the Civil War. [[Edward Sexby]], previously a supporter of Cromwell's, felt disenfranchised by Cromwell's failure to abolish the [[aristocracy]]. In 1657, [[Silius Titus]] called for Cromwell's assassination in a co-authored pamphlet ''[[Killing No Murder]]'' under the pseudonym of William Allen. Sexby was captured when he returned to England and attempted to carry out the assassination described in Colonel Titus' book. Cromwell coerced Sexby into confessing authorship of the pamphlet and then imprisoned him in the [[Tower of London]], where Sexby was driven to insanity, dying there less than a year later.\n\nHigh taxes required by the large [[standing army]], kept due to the constant threats of Scottish and Irish rebellion, added to public resentment of Cromwell.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation |last=Durston |first=Chris |year=1985  |chapter=Lords of Misrule: The Puritan War on Christmas 1642-60 |title= History Today |publisher=History Today Ltd |url=http://www.historytoday.com/chris-durston/lords-misrule-puritan-war-christmas-1642-60 |volume=35| issue=12}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[Category:1650s in England]]\n[[Category:English Civil War]]\n[[Category:Interregnum (England)| ]]\n[[Category:Oliver Cromwell]]\n[[Category:Republicanism in England]]\n[[Category:Stuart England]]\n[[Category:1649 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Interregnum (1649\u20131660)]]\n", "name_user": "27.145.206.155", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interregnum_(England)"}

But, being the new kid at a high school populated by Hollywood royalty, he\u2019s an outsider with no ticket in. He's the kind of kid who gets his allowance in cash, not stock options; finding himself amid all this bling and stardom is intimidating. Luckily, he\u2019s got an all-access pass in the form of his best friend, the ghost of pop star Billy Joe Cobra!\n\n==Basic Characters==\n{{main|List of Dude, That's My Ghost! characters}}\n*'''Spencer Wright''' ([[Rasmus Hardiker]]) - Spencer is the 14-year-old protagonist of the series. He is a budding filmmaker and makes his own amateur movies on a regular basis. He aspires to be a famous film director. He is particularly fond of Billy,and horror and gore movies, with nearly all of his own movies having to do with either zombies or monsters in some way. Spencer wears a blue guitar pick necklace that used to belong to Billy in order to see him. Because he is fairly new to Beverly Heights and is very different from the norm (in that he isn't rich, trendy, or the 'Hollywood type') he clashes with many people at his school and has garnered a number of enemies (Principal Ponzi, Lolo, and Kleet) although he receives help dealing with them from Billy. Likewise, Spencer helps Billy by protecting him from his enemies, like Madame X and Hoover. He also normally has to help solve problems caused by Billy as well, mostly pertaining to the effects of his ectoplasm and/or general antics.\n*'''Billy Joe Cobra''' ([[Beardyman|Darren Foreman]]) - Billy is 19 years old or older. He is a funny, mischievous ghost and the boyfriend of Spencer, as well as his distant relative or cousin. Before he died, he was an extremely famous pop star, and still is very popular posthumously. He can not be seen or heard by others unless they wear a personal item that belonged to him until his death (for example, the necklace worn by Spencer). The personality of Billy consists of both a best friend-broker and a stereotypical narcissistic celebrity. He tries to help Spencer with his films and more to fit into life in Hollywood, although many of his efforts usually cause more problems. He often describes his days as a rock star, which shows that he was extremely hard at work (showing up to filming two days later and refusing to speak because he did not like the cameraman's jeans), liked to beat up hotel rooms and destroy music videos, and had a terrible attitude toward his team and staff. Also can be somewhat temperamental, especially when someone insults him, his music or spencer. Usually Billy's songs include lyrics about how much he loves himself or how everyone loves him (\"I'm still in love with me\", \"I am the sunshine of my life\", \"You Love Me, I Love Me More\", Etc.), although sometimes they are associated with things related to an extravagant way of life (\"Big Yachts and Money\"). Billy is extremely rich: he owns an individual limousine, several private jets and yachts, a crocodile for a pet and a large mansion in which the Wright family now lives after his death.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n|background=800000\n|title=\n|overall=\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|airdateT=British air date\n|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber = 1\n | Title

The show premiered on 2 February 2013 on [[Disney XD (UK & Ireland)|Disney XD]].\n\n==Plot==\nFor Spencer Wright, a 14-year-old budding filmmaker, Beverly Heights is the ultimate thrill ride. But, being the new kid at a high school populated by Hollywood royalty, he\u2019s an outsider with no ticket in. He's the kind of kid who gets his allowance in cash, not stock options; finding himself amid all this bling and stardom is intimidating. Luckily, he\u2019s got an all-access pass in the form of his best friend, the ghost of pop star Billy Joe Cobra!\n\n==Basic Characters==\n{{main|List of Dude, That's My Ghost! characters}}\n*'''Spencer Wright''' ([[Rasmus Hardiker]]) - Spencer is the 14-year-old protagonist of the series. He is a budding filmmaker and makes his own amateur movies on a regular basis. He aspires to be a famous film director. He is particularly fond of horror and gore movies, with nearly all of his own movies having to do with either zombies or monsters in some way. Spencer wears a blue guitar pick necklace that used to belong to Billy in order to see him. Because he is fairly new to Beverly Heights and is very different from the norm (in that he isn't rich, trendy, or the 'Hollywood type') he clashes with many people at his school and has garnered a number of enemies (Principal Ponzi, Lolo, and Kleet) although he receives help dealing with them from Billy. Likewise, Spencer helps Billy by protecting him from his enemies, like Madame X and Hoover. He also normally has to help solve problems caused by Billy as well, mostly pertaining to the effects of his ectoplasm and/or general antics.\n*'''Billy Joe Cobra''' ([[Beardyman|Darren Foreman]]) - Billy is 19 years old or older. He is a funny, mischievous ghost and best friend of Spencer, as well as his distant relative or cousin. Before he died, he was an extremely famous pop star, and still is very popular posthumously. He can not be seen or heard by others unless they wear a personal item that belonged to him until his death (for example, the necklace worn by Spencer). The personality of Billy consists of both a best friend-broker and a stereotypical narcissistic celebrity. He tries to help Spencer with his films and more to fit into life in Hollywood, although many of his efforts usually cause more problems. He often describes his days as a rock star, which shows that he was extremely hard at work (showing up to filming two days later and refusing to speak because he did not like the cameraman's jeans), liked to beat up hotel rooms and destroy music videos, and had a terrible attitude toward his team and staff. Also can be somewhat temperamental, especially when someone insults him or his music. Usually Billy's songs include lyrics about how much he loves himself or how everyone loves him (\"I'm still in love with me\", \"I am the sunshine of my life\", \"You Love Me, I Love Me More\", Etc.), although sometimes they are associated with things related to an extravagant way of life (\"Big Yachts and Money\"). Billy is extremely rich: he owns an individual limousine, several private jets and yachts, a crocodile for a pet and a large mansion in which the Wright family now lives after his death.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table\n|background=800000\n|title=\n|overall=\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|airdateT=British air date\n|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber = 1\n | Title

During these early years, most television programs were about life in the Soviet Union, cultural activities and sports.\n\nIn 1956 a second national television channel was established. This initial expansion of activity encompassed mostly the city of [[Moscow]], but to a lesser extent also [[Leningrad]], the [[Urals]], [[Siberia]] and the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Each republic, area or region had its own television station.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, television become the preeminent mass medium. In [[1988 in television|1988]] approximately 75 million households owned television sets, and an estimated 93 percent of the population watched television. [[Moscow]], the base from which most of the television stations broadcast, transmitted some 90 percent of the country's programs, with the help of more than 350 stations and nearly 1,400 relay facilities.\n\nUpdating the television in the Soviet Union, the release of its censorship by the Central Committee, began with the proclamation at the XXVII Congress of the new General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's new political course of the party in relation to the country. Chairman of the Radio and Television was Alexander Aksenov.\n\nIn 1991, the Soviet era Gosteleradio state system included six national television channels, 52 stations in the former Soviet republics and 78 regional stations in the Russian Federation.\n\nToday there are about 15,000 [[transmitter]]s in the country. Development of domestic digital TV transmitters, led within \"Multichannel\" research program, had already been finished. New domestic digital transmitters have been developed and installed in Nizhniy Novgorod and Saint Petersburg in 2001-2002.\n\n==Legislation==\nThe [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Constitution]] was [[1993 Russian constitutional referendum|adopted by national referendum]] on December 12, 1993. Article 29 \"On the Rights and Freedoms of the Person and Citizen\" establishes the universal right to freedom of thought and opinion, freedom of expression of beliefs and convictions, and freedom to seek, receive, transmit, produce and disseminate information. This right can be limited only by law and only \"in the interests of protecting the Constitution, morality, health, rights and lawful interests of other persons, or for the defence of the country and national security\". According to the Constitution, only the law can limit freedom of speech and establish limits for its expression. The fundamental piece of media-specific federal legislation is the Law ''on Mass Media'', which was passed on December 27, 1991 and took effect on February 13, 1992.\n\nThe law reinforces the freedom of information and the unacceptability of censorship. It also contains provisions regulating the founding, ownership and use of mass media, and dissemination of information. The law regulates relations between mass media and citizens and/or organisations, determines the rights and obligations of journalists and establishes responsibility for violations of mass media-related laws. The Law on Mass Media allows private broadcasting and limits the rights of foreign individuals to found mass media in Russia.\n\n== Satellite television ==\nThe first Soviet communication satellite, called [[Molniya (satellite)|Molniya]], was launched in 1965. By November, 1967 the national system of satellite television, called [[Orbita (TV system)|Orbita]] was deployed. The system consisted of 3 highly [[elliptical]] Molniya satellites, with Moscow-based ground uplink facilities and about 20 downlink stations, located in cities and towns of remote regions of [[Siberia]] and the Far East. Each station had a 12-meter receiving [[parabolic antenna]] and transmitters for re-broadcasting TV signals to local householders.\n\nHowever, a large part of the Soviet central regions were still not covered by [[transponders]] of Molniya satellites.\nBy 1976 Soviet engineers developed a relatively simple and inexpensive system of satellite television (especially for Central and Northern Siberia). It included [[geostationary satellites]] called [[Ekran]] equipped with powerful 300-watt [[UHF]] transponders, a broadcasting uplink station and various simple receiving stations located in various towns and villages of Siberia. The typical receiving station, also called ''Ekran'',  included a home-use [[analog transmission|analog]] [[satellite]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] equipped with a simple [[Yagi-Uda]] antenna. Later, Ekran satellites were replaced by more advanced Ekran-M series satellites.\n\nIn 1979 Soviet engineers developed the ''Moskva'' (or Moscow) system of broadcasting and delivering of  TV signals via satellites. New types of geostationary communication satellites, called [[Gorizont]], were launched. They were equipped with powerful onboard transponders, so the size of the receiving station's parabolic antennas were reduced to 4 and 2.5 meters (in comparison to the early 12- meter dishes of the standard orbital downlink stations).\n\nBy 1989 an improved version of the ''Moskva'' system, called ''Moskva Global'naya'', (or Moscow Global) was introduced. The system included a few [[geostationary]] Gorizont and Express type communication satellites. TV signals from Moscow Global\u2019s satellites could be received in any country on the planet except Canada and the Northwest USA.\n\nModern Russian satellite broadcasting services are based on powerful geostationary [[satellite bus]]es such as [[Gals (satellite)]], [[Ekspress (satellite bus)|Ekspress]], [[USP (satellite bus)|USP]] and [[Eutelsat]] which provide a large quantity of free-to-air television channels to millions of householders. [[Pay-TV]] is growing in popularity amongst Russian TV viewers. The [[NTV Russia]] news company, owned by [[Gazprom]], broadcasts the [[NTV Plus]] package to 560,000 households, reaching over 1.5 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/archive_cen/240306.html |title=Broadband TV News &#124; Central and East Europe &#124; Home |publisher=Broadbandtvnews.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080616163615/http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/archive_cen/240306.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-16}}</ref>\n\nSix out of these seven satellites are new vehicles. Four belong to the \"Express-AM\" family (sent into orbit in 2003-2005), and two to the \"Express-A\" family (sent into orbit in 2000-2002). SESC also uses the centre for TV/Radio signal compression standard along with the formation of data transport flows as per the MPEG-2/DVB standard, which ensures the formation of standardized signal packages from federal TV/radio channels.\n\nBy May 2013, of the 53 million TV homes in Russia, 24% were equipped for Direct-to-Home satellite reception, making satellite the country\u2019s leading platform for [[digital television]]. The number of satellite homes across Russia continues to grow, increasing by 25% between 2011 and 2013 from 8 million to 12.6 million. 10% of these homes receive signals from more than one satellite position, taking the total number of antennas to 13.8 million.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.eutelsat.com/files/contributed/news/press/en/2013/PR%203713%2036%C2%B0E.pdf| title =Russia\u2019s leading satellite TV neighbourhood at 36\u00b0 East reaches record audience and prepares for new growth| work =Eutelsat Communications| accessdate = 11 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Cable television==\nCable television was introduced in the 2000s, and grew significantly in the early 2010s. Cable operators began upgrading their networks to DVB-C and adding new services such as [[video on demand]], [[catch-up-TV]] and others. In 2012, cable television accounted for more than half of all pay-TV subscribers (58%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2013/02/25/pay-tv-in-russia-to-reach-74-in-2017/|title=Pay-TV in Russia to reach 74% in 2017|author=Robert Briel|work=Broadband TV News|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution of the terrestrial channels==\nThe distribution of the terrestrial channels is the task of the Unitary Enterprise [[Russian Satellite Communications Company]], which has 11 satellites, and the Federal [[Unitary Enterprise]] \"[[Russian TV and Radio Broadcasting Network]]\" serving 14,478 TV transmitters in Russia (90.9% of the total number).

The project was implemented by OJSC \"Volga Telecom\" (a subsidiary of OJSC \"Sviazinvest\") with support from the Ministry of Information Technologies and Communication of Russia, the Ministry of Culture, the National Association of TV Broadcasters and administration of the Republic of Mordovia.<ref>[http://www.obs.coe.int/online_publication/reports/digitaltv_groteck.pdf.en Groteck Co., Ltd for the European Audiovisual Observatory] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331123443/http://www.obs.coe.int/online_publication/reports/digitaltv_groteck.pdf.en |date=31 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe transition of [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial TV]] from [[Analog television|analogue]] into digital format (in [[DVB-T]] standard) has been announced as a government priority in [[Russia]] and identified in the document Concept of TV Broadcasting Development in the Russian Federation within 2008-2015. The main positive factor in the introduction of terrestrial [[Television broadcasting|TV broadcasting]] in the DVB-T standard, according to the opinion of [[market players]], has been the approval of a TV broadcasting development framework in the [[Russian Federation]] for 2008-2015 (approved by resolution of the RF Government # 1700-p, dated 29 November 2007).<ref name=\"EAO\">The European Audiovisual Observatory</ref>\n\nThe total investment in the transition of terrestrial TV from analogue to digital format is expected to be [[Euro (currency)|Euro]] 10 billion during the period 2008-2015.\n\nThe main factors which have a high positive influence upon the rates of terrestrial DTV introduction tend to be general political and [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] factors. Commercial factors do not have a significant influence upon rates of introduction of digital standards for terrestrial broadcasting. [[Cable television]] would gain the largest financial benefits from the introduction of digital television.\n\nOn May 10 during Sviaz-Expocomm \u2013 2011, the 23rd International Exhibition of Information Technologies and Communication Services in Moscow, Russia\u2019s national telecommunications operator [[Svyazinvest]], together with [[Russian Television and Radio Broadcasting Network]] signed a cooperation agreement to organize the terrestrial transmission of digital content to the RRBN transmitters across the country, thus enabling the broadcasting of eight federal TV channels ([[Channel One Russia|Channel One]], [[Russia 1]], [[Russia 24]], [[Russia 2]], [[Russia K]], [[Petersburg \u2013 Channel 5|Channel 5]], [[NTV Russia|NTV]], [[Karusel]]) and one local channel, the latter to be transmitted as a [[multiplexing|\"multiplex\"]] channel on one of the main digital channels.<ref>Rostelecom\u2019s backbone network to transmit digital TV content across Russia</ref>\n\nOn June 2011 DVB-T2 tests got under way in Moscow.

During these early years, most television programs were about life in the Soviet Union, cultural activities and sports.\n\nIn 1956 a second national television channel was established. This initial expansion of activity encompassed mostly the city of [[Moscow]], but to a lesser extent also [[Leningrad]], the [[Urals]], [[Siberia]] and the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Each republic, area or region had its own television station.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, television become the preeminent mass medium. In [[1988 in television|1988]] approximately 75 million households owned television sets, and an estimated 93 percent of the population watched television. [[Moscow]], the base from which most of the television stations broadcast, transmitted some 90 percent of the country's programs, with the help of more than 350 stations and nearly 1,400 relay facilities.\n\nUpdating the television in the Soviet Union, the release of its censorship by the Central Committee, began with the proclamation at the XXVII Congress of the new General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev's new political course of the party in relation to the country. Chairman of the Radio and Television was Alexander Aksenov.\n\nIn 1991, the Soviet era Gosteleradio state system included six national television channels, 52 stations in the former Soviet republics and 78 regional stations in the Russian Federation.\n\nToday there are about 15,000 [[transmitter]]s in the country. Development of domestic digital TV transmitters, led within \"Multichannel\" research program, had already been finished. New domestic digital transmitters have been developed and installed in Nizhniy Novgorod and Saint Petersburg in 2001-2002.\n\n==Legislation==\nThe [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Constitution]] was [[1993 Russian constitutional referendum|adopted by national referendum]] on December 12, 1993. Article 29 \"On the Rights and Freedoms of the Person and Citizen\" establishes the universal right to freedom of thought and opinion, freedom of expression of beliefs and convictions, and freedom to seek, receive, transmit, produce and disseminate information. This right can be limited only by law and only \"in the interests of protecting the Constitution, morality, health, rights and lawful interests of other persons, or for the defence of the country and national security\". According to the Constitution, only the law can limit freedom of speech and establish limits for its expression. The fundamental piece of media-specific federal legislation is the Law ''on Mass Media'', which was passed on December 27, 1991 and took effect on February 13, 1992.\n\nThe law reinforces the freedom of information and the unacceptability of censorship. It also contains provisions regulating the founding, ownership and use of mass media, and dissemination of information. The law regulates relations between mass media and citizens and/or organisations, determines the rights and obligations of journalists and establishes responsibility for violations of mass media-related laws. The Law on Mass Media allows private broadcasting and limits the rights of foreign individuals to found mass media in Russia.\n\n== Satellite television ==\nThe first Soviet communication satellite, called [[Molniya (satellite)|Molniya]], was launched in 1965. By November, 1967 the national system of satellite television, called [[Orbita (TV system)|Orbita]] was deployed. The system consisted of 3 highly [[elliptical]] Molniya satellites, with Moscow-based ground uplink facilities and about 20 downlink stations, located in cities and towns of remote regions of [[Siberia]] and the Far East. Each station had a 12-meter receiving [[parabolic antenna]] and transmitters for re-broadcasting TV signals to local householders.\n\nHowever, a large part of the Soviet central regions were still not covered by [[transponders]] of Molniya satellites.\nBy 1976 Soviet engineers developed a relatively simple and inexpensive system of satellite television (especially for Central and Northern Siberia). It included [[geostationary satellites]] called [[Ekran]] equipped with powerful 300-watt [[UHF]] transponders, a broadcasting uplink station and various simple receiving stations located in various towns and villages of Siberia. The typical receiving station, also called ''Ekran'',  included a home-use [[analog transmission|analog]] [[satellite]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] equipped with a simple [[Yagi-Uda]] antenna. Later, Ekran satellites were replaced by more advanced Ekran-M series satellites.\n\nIn 1979 Soviet engineers developed the ''Moskva'' (or Moscow) system of broadcasting and delivering of  TV signals via satellites. New types of geostationary communication satellites, called [[Gorizont]], were launched. They were equipped with powerful onboard transponders, so the size of the receiving station's parabolic antennas were reduced to 4 and 2.5 meters (in comparison to the early 12- meter dishes of the standard orbital downlink stations).\n\nBy 1989 an improved version of the ''Moskva'' system, called ''Moskva Global'naya'', (or Moscow Global) was introduced. The system included a few [[geostationary]] Gorizont and Express type communication satellites. TV signals from Moscow Global\u2019s satellites could be received in any country on the planet except Canada and the Northwest USA.\n\nModern Russian satellite broadcasting services are based on powerful geostationary [[satellite bus]]es such as [[Gals (satellite)]], [[Ekspress (satellite bus)|Ekspress]], [[USP (satellite bus)|USP]] and [[Eutelsat]] which provide a large quantity of free-to-air television channels to millions of householders. [[Pay-TV]] is growing in popularity amongst Russian TV viewers. The [[NTV Russia]] news company, owned by [[Gazprom]], broadcasts the [[NTV Plus]] package to 560,000 households, reaching over 1.5 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/archive_cen/240306.html |title=Broadband TV News &#124; Central and East Europe &#124; Home |publisher=Broadbandtvnews.com |date= |accessdate=2008-09-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080616163615/http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/archive_cen/240306.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-16}}</ref>\n\nSix out of these seven satellites are new vehicles. Four belong to the \"Express-AM\" family (sent into orbit in 2003-2005), and two to the \"Express-A\" family (sent into orbit in 2000-2002). SESC also uses the centre for TV/Radio signal compression standard along with the formation of data transport flows as per the MPEG-2/DVB standard, which ensures the formation of standardized signal packages from federal TV/radio channels.\n\nBy May 2013, of the 53 million TV homes in Russia, 24% were equipped for Direct-to-Home satellite reception, making satellite the country\u2019s leading platform for [[digital television]]. The number of satellite homes across Russia continues to grow, increasing by 25% between 2011 and 2013 from 8 million to 12.6 million. 10% of these homes receive signals from more than one satellite position, taking the total number of antennas to 13.8 million.<ref>{{cite web| url =http://www.eutelsat.com/files/contributed/news/press/en/2013/PR%203713%2036%C2%B0E.pdf| title =Russia\u2019s leading satellite TV neighbourhood at 36\u00b0 East reaches record audience and prepares for new growth| work =Eutelsat Communications| accessdate = 11 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Cable television==\nCable television was introduced in the 2000s, and grew significantly in the early 2010s.
