Haley.<ref>[http://cityofmidlandmi.gov/695/Library-Cards#service\" \"Service Area of the Grace A. Dow Memorial Library\"]</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1899, Midland Library Association was formed as a subscription library with 25 charter members paying $1 a year that entitled them to check out 1 book a week for the year. Mary Dow, sister to Herbert H. Dow, was the first librarian. In 1900, The Library Association opened their subscription library in a room at the Unitarian Church with a collection of 100 books. In May, 1900, a Free Reading Room was established with the support of local manufacturers and businesses.  In 1915, the Library Association transferred control of the Midland Library and Free Reading Room to the Midland Board of Education.  In 1919, the [[Carnegie library|Carnegie Library]] opened next to the Community Center on Townsend Street.<ref>Yates, Dorothy Langdon.  Tell Me a Story - for One Hundred Years: The Grace A. Dow Memorial Library.  2000.</ref>\n\nThe Library Board was dissolved in 1951 and the City of Midland established a Library Advisory Board.  All Library employees became employees of the City of Midland.\n\nA new library was opened on Monday, January 24, 1955 at the corner of West St. Andrews Street and Eastman Avenue.  It was named the \"Grace A. Dow Memorial Library\" after architect [[Alden B. Dow]]'s mother.  [[Grace A. Dow]], wife of [[Herbert Henry Dow]] (founder of the [[Dow Chemical Company]]), was instrumental in the construction of the new library.  After her death in 1953, before construction began, the library was named in her memory.  The new Grace A. Dow Memorial Library celebrated 50 years in this building in 2005.\n\nOn October 21, 2012, library director Melissa Barnard announced a $3 million grant from the [[Grace A. Dow#Foundation|Herbert H. and Grace A. Dow Foundation]] to pay for infrastructure improvements and interior remodeling. Including this gift, the foundation has given $9.1 million to the library since 1938.<ref name=RCV>{{cite news|title=Grace A.

Haley.<ref>[http://cityofmidlandmi.gov/695/Library-Cards#service\" \"Service Area of the Grace A. Dow Memorial Library\"]</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1899, Midland Library Association was formed as a subscription library with 25 charter members paying $1 a year that entitled them to check out 1 book a week for the year. Mary Dow, sister to Herbert H. Dow, was the first librarian. In 1900, The Library Association opened their subscription library in a room at the Unitarian Church with a collection of 100 books. In May, 1900, a Free Reading Room was established with the support of local manufacturers and businesses.  In 1915, the Library Association transferred control of the Midland Library and Free Reading Room to the Midland Board of Education.  In 1919, the [[Carnegie library|Carnegie Library]] opened next to the Community Center on Townsend Street.<ref>Yates, Dorothy Langdon.  Tell Me a Story - for One Hundred Years: The Grace A.

All Library employees became employees of the City of Midland.\n\nA new library was opened on Monday, January 24, 1955 at the corner of West St. Andrews Street and Eastman Avenue.  It was named the \"Grace A. Dow Memorial Library\" after architect [[Alden B. Dow]]'s mother.  [[Grace A. Dow]], wife of [[Herbert Henry Dow]] (founder of the [[Dow Chemical Company]]), was instrumental in the construction of the new library.  After her death in 1953, before construction began, the library was named in her memory.  The new Grace A. Dow Memorial Library celebrated 50 years in this building in 2005.\n\nOn October 21, 2012, library director Melissa Barnard announced a $3 million grant from the [[Grace A.

The most points of the day were the result of fullback brown and his five PATs (at the time called goals after touchdowns, and worth 2 points) for 10 points.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193854/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/349847459/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193877/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref>\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = September 14\n| time = \n| w/l = exh.\n| opponent = [[JBS USA|Swift & Co.]]\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago, IL]]\n| score = 28-0\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = September 28\n| time = 3:30pm\n| w/l = l\n| opponent = [[1895 Chicago Maroons football team|Chicago]]<ref>{{cite web|title=1895 Chicago Maroons Schedule and Results|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=SR/College Football|accessdate=December 8, 2015|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/chicago/1895-schedule.html}}</ref>\n| site_stadium = [[Marshall Field]]\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 0-8\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 4\n| time = 3pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Rush Medical\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 30-0\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 12\n| time = 3:30pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]]\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 8-0\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 19\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[1895 Indianapolis Light Artillery football team|Indianapolis Light Artillery]]\n| site_stadium = East Ohio Street grounds\n| site_cityst = [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis, IN]]\n| score = 16\u20130\n| attend = 400\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 22\n| time = 4:20pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Rush-Lake Forest\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 30-0\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 27\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Newton AC\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton, MA]]\n| score = 4\u20130\n| attend = 2800\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 29\n| time = 3:30pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = {{cfb link|year=1895|team=MIT Engineers|title=MIT}}\n| site_stadium = [[South End Grounds]]\n| site_cityst = [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston, MA]]\n| score = 46-0\n| attend = 500\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 1\n| time = \n| w/l = l\n| opponent = [[1895 Penn Quakers football team|Penn]]\n| site_stadium = [[Franklin Field]]\n| site_cityst = [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia, PA]]\n| score = 4-12\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 5\n| time = 3:45pm\n| w/l = l\n| opponent = [[Orange/Newark Tornadoes|Orange AC]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.luckyshow.org/football/orangeac.htm |title = Orange Athletic Club All-Time Football Records}}</ref>\n| site_stadium = [[East Orange Oval]]\n| site_cityst = [[Orange, New Jersey|Orange, NJ]]\n| score = 0-24\n| attend = 4000-9000\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 7\n| time = 3:40pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Wilmington YMCA\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilimington, DE]]\n| score = 40-0\n| attend = 600-3000\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 9\n| time = 3pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = {{cfb link|year=1895|team=Duquesne Country and Athletic Club|title=Duquesne Country AC}}\n| site_stadium = [[Exposition Park]]\n| site_cityst = [[Allegheny City, Pennsylvania|Allegheny City, PA]]\n| score =  34-4\n| attend = 500\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 23\n| time = 3pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Indianapolis Light Artillery\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 4-0\n| attend = 1000\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 28\n| time = 11am\n| w/l = t\n| opponent = Boston AC\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 4-4\n| attend = 6000-7000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Roster==\n\nThere are a few things to note about the roster of the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past Playing Experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

The most points of the day were the result of fullback brown and his five PATs (at the time called goals after touchdowns, and worth 2 points) for 10 points.<ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193854/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/349847459/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref><ref>https://www.newspapers.com/image/34193877/?terms=Chicago%2BAthletic%2BAssociation%2Bfootball</ref>\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = September 14\n| time = \n| w/l = exh.\n| opponent = [[JBS USA|Swift & Co.]]\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago, IL]]\n| score = 28-0\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = September 28\n| time = 3:30pm\n| w/l = l\n| opponent = [[1895 Chicago Maroons football team|Chicago]]<ref>{{cite web|title=1895 Chicago Maroons Schedule and Results|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|work=SR/College Football|accessdate=December 8, 2015|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/chicago/1895-schedule.html}}</ref>\n| site_stadium = [[Marshall Field]]\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 0-8\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 4\n| time = 3pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Rush Medical\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 30-0\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 12\n| time = 3:30pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]]\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 8-0\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 19\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = [[1895 Indianapolis Light Artillery football team|Indianapolis Light Artillery]]\n| site_stadium = East Ohio Street grounds\n| site_cityst = [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis, IN]]\n| score = 16\u20130\n| attend = 400\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 22\n| time = 4:20pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Rush-Lake Forest\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 30-0\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 27\n| time =\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Newton AC\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton, MA]]\n| score = 4\u20130\n| attend = 2800\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 29\n| time = 3:30pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = {{cfb link|year=1895|team=MIT Engineers|title=MIT}}\n| site_stadium = [[South End Grounds]]\n| site_cityst = [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston, MA]]\n| score = 46-0\n| attend = 500\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 1\n| time = \n| w/l = l\n| opponent = [[1895 Penn Quakers football team|Penn]]\n| site_stadium = [[Franklin Field]]\n| site_cityst = [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia, PA]]\n| score = 4-12\n| attend = \n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 5\n| time = 3:45pm\n| w/l = l\n| opponent = [[Orange/Newark Tornadoes|Orange AC]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.luckyshow.org/football/orangeac.htm |title = Orange Athletic Club All-Time Football Records}}</ref>\n| site_stadium = [[East Orange Oval]]\n| site_cityst = [[Orange, New Jersey|Orange, NJ]]\n| score = 0-24\n| attend = 4000-9000\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 7\n| time = 3:40pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Wilmington YMCA\n| site_stadium = \n| site_cityst = [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilimington, DE]]\n| score = 40-0\n| attend = 600-3000\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 9\n| time = 3pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = {{cfb link|year=1895|team=Duquesne Country and Athletic Club|title=Duquesne Country AC}}\n| site_stadium = [[Exposition Park]]\n| site_cityst = [[Allegheny City, Pennsylvania|Allegheny City, PA]]\n| score =  34-4\n| attend = 500\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 23\n| time = 3pm\n| w/l = w\n| opponent = Indianapolis Light Artillery\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 4-0\n| attend = 1000\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 28\n| time = 11am\n| w/l = t\n| opponent = Boston AC\n| site_stadium = CAA Field\n| site_cityst = Chicago, IL\n| score = 4-4\n| attend = 6000-7000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Roster==\n\nThere are a few things to note about the roster of the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past Playing Experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

Many poison dart frogs in the genera ''[[Oophaga]]'' and ''[[Ranitomeya]]'' carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles stick to the mucus on the backs of their parents. Once in the upper reaches of the rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in the pools of water that accumulate in [[epiphytic]] plants, such as [[bromeliads]]. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, and their mother will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other poison frogs lay their eggs on the forest floor, hidden beneath the leaf litter. Poison frogs [[external fertilization|fertilize their eggs externally]]; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. Poison frogs can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most frogs copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his [[mating call]]; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor's eggs.<ref>[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]].</ref>\n\nThe operational sex ratio in the poison dart frog family is mostly female biased. This leads to a few characteristic behaviors and traits found in organisms with an uneven sex ratio. In general, females have a choice of mate. In turn, males show brighter coloration, are territorial, and are aggressive toward other males. Females select mates based on coloration (mainly dorsal), calling perch location, and territory.<ref name=SummersEtAl99 />\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nDart frogs are the focus of major phylogenetic studies, and undergo taxonomic changes frequently.<ref name=\"Grant\">{{cite journal\n|author=Grant, T., Frost, D.

Many poison dart frogs in the genera ''[[Oophaga]]'' and ''[[Ranitomeya]]'' carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles stick to the mucus on the backs of their parents. Once in the upper reaches of the rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in the pools of water that accumulate in [[epiphytic]] plants, such as [[bromeliads]]. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, and their mother will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other poison frogs lay their eggs on the forest floor, hidden beneath the leaf litter. Poison frogs [[external fertilization|fertilize their eggs externally]]; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. Poison frogs can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most frogs copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his [[mating call]]; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor's eggs.<ref>[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]].</ref>\n\nThe operational sex ratio in the poison dart frog family is mostly female biased. This leads to a few characteristic behaviors and traits found in organisms with an uneven sex ratio. In general, females have a choice of mate. In turn, males show brighter coloration, are territorial, and are aggressive toward other males. Females select mates based on coloration (mainly dorsal), calling perch location, and territory.<ref name=SummersEtAl99 />\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nDart frogs are the focus of major phylogenetic studies, and undergo taxonomic changes frequently.<ref name=\"Grant\">{{cite journal\n|author=Grant, T., Frost, D.
