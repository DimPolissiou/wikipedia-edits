He was fondly known as '''Reb Burech Hermanshtater'''.\n\nBorn in [[Michalovce]], [[Slovakia]] (then [[Zempl\u00e9n County]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]]), as a young child he was already recognized by all who met him as an extremely devout and diligent student. He learned in [[Kisv\u00e1rda]] by the famed author of the ''Arugas Habosem'', Rabbi [[Moshe Greenwald]] and soon became one of the top students there. Reb [[Yechezkel Shraga Halberstam]], the Shinover Rebbe, spoke very highly of Reb Boruch held him in high esteem. Rabbi Boruch Greenfield married Rivkah Weinberger in 1891 in [[Stropkov]] where he founded a small [[yeshiva]] at that time. Later he became the [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)|Dayan]] of ''Shebesh, Potneck, and [[Hermenshtat]]'', where he founded the Orthodox Sephardic community he served as the interim Rabbi of ''[[Klausenberg]]'' (where he was also instrumental in founding the Orthodox Sephardic community) shortly before coming to the USA.\n\nIn 1923 he immigrated to the United States where he served as the Rabbi in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania]], [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]], [[The Bronx]], [[New York City]], and the [[Lower East Side]] at the 52 Cannon Street [[Shul]]. He was extremely upset with the laxness in which Torah Judaism was being led and he fought this laxness fiercely. In 1935 he moved to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and upon his arrival was offered a number of high rabbinical posts. As in previous times during his life, due to his great humility he declined such positions, but was, however, one of the leaders of the [[Edah HaChareidis]].\n\nReb Borech was close with the Satmar Rebbe, Rabbi [[Yoel Teitelbaum]], and they learned together daily for a period of time. He was also close to the Belzer Rebbe Rabbi [[Aharon Rokeach]] who highly respected Reb Borech and spoke well of him.\n\nBesides his fame as a great Torah Scholar, Rabbi Greenfield was talented musically and a baal tefillah [[Chazan]]. In 1975 a [[Sefer (Hebrew)|sefer]] with a small collection of his writings was printed under the name ''Ohel Boruch''.\n\nReb Burech had five children that reached adulthood. The oldest was Mariam who married Reb Nusen Baumhaft, the Rosh Yeshiva of Klausenberg. Nusen, Mariam and fourteen of their children, perished in the Holocaust. One of Mariam's children, Sidonia, also known as Silka, survived. After the war Sidonia married and had three children. Reb Burech's second child was Ruchel who married a fine Torah scholar named Reb Ahron Klausner. The Klausners had two children. His third child was Eidel, married to Reb Shimon Fischman; they were childless. His fourth child, Mirel, married Reb Chaim Pall. She died during childbirth and was left childless.

He was an expert in agricultural archives, and served as president of the Agricultural History Society.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n===Ancestry===\nPinkett's ancestors were free blacks in Maryland as early as 1820, including Pinkett's great-grandfather, Denard Pinkett.<ref name=\":0\" /> Denard worked as a free laborer on a slaveowner's farm in [[Somerset County, Maryland|Somerset County]] and later married one of his slaves, Mary, with whom he had twelve children. All twelve of these children were born slaves under a Maryland slave law that stated slave status came from the mother.<ref name=\":0\" /> Adam Pinkett was one of Denard's children and was Harold T. Pinkett's grandfather.\n\nAdam fought for the Union Army in the [[American Civil War]] from 1863-1866. After the war, he was fortunate to become literate and own both land and a house. He helped found his local [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist Episcopal]] church and soon became licensed as a pastor.\n\nHarold's father, Levin Wilson Pinkett, lacked a formal education and worked as a custodian and gardener.<ref name=\":0\" /> Levin, like his father, Adam, advanced to become a pastor in the local [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist Episcopal church]].\n\n=== Early Life and Education ===\nHarold T. Pinkett was born on April 7, 1914 to Levin Wilson Pinkett and Catherine Pinkett. He was born in the segregated county of Salisbury, ravaged by [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] vigilantism. Between 1889 and 1918, whites committed seventeen lynchings and the area was named \"Mississippi on the Chesapeake.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Throughout his life, he remained committed to education, religion, and personal achievement.\n\nAs a boy, Pinkett was a newsboy for the ''Afro-American'' and also distributed issues of the ''National Association of the Advancement of Colored People's Crisis''. From 1910-1934, [[W. E. B. Du Bois|W.E.B. DuBois]] edited the ''Crisis'', which lobbied for African American civil rights and Pinkett later wrote for the publication.\n\nWhen he was sixteen, Pinkett enrolled in the Methodist institution, [[Morgan State University|Morgan College]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He was able to garner a Maryland state scholarship to pay for his tuition and he waited tables each summer to cover his rent. While at Morgan, he pledged to [[Omega Psi Phi]], [[Zeta Sigma Pi]] and [[Alpha Kappa Mu]]. He graduated in 1935 with highest honors.<ref name=\"prolog\">{{Cite web|url=https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2016/02/18/harold-pinkett-an-archivist-and-scholar/|title=Harold Pinkett: An Archivist and Scholar|date=2016-02-18|website=Pieces of History|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref>\n\nThen he wanted to pursue a graduate education in history, but the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County|University of Maryland]] was still segregated. So in the fall of 1935, Pinkett began his graduate work at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He lived with family nearby to save money and also worked for the New Deal's National Youth Administration as a social investigator in the Public Defender's Office.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter just one year, he began teaching Latin at a Baltimore high school, where he stayed for a year and a half. The experience gave him the ambition to return to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to finish his master's degree in 1938.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, he was struggling financially and after graduation, he returned south to teach at [[Livingstone College]]. He was appointed as a sabbatical fill-in for the 1938-1939 school year. After his appointment was over, he wanted to return to school for his doctorate. The [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County|University of Maryland]] remained closed to African Americans so he enrolled in [[Columbia University]].\n\nAfter just one year at Columbia, Pinkett began to struggle financially and turned to teaching again. From 1940 to 1941, he was a faculty member at Florida Normal College in St. Augustine and taught history, government and geography.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1941, he returned to teach at Livingstone. He also began to court Lucille Cannady and they married in the spring of 1943. Lucille also worked with the federal government, working with the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] for 33 years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the war, Pinkett returned to graduate school for his doctorate. In 1948, he began his work at [[American University]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He graduated in 1953 with a PhD in history and archival administration. His dissertation was entitled \u201cGifford Pinchot and the Early Conservation Movement in the United States,\" which went on to be published by the [[University of Illinois Press]] and won the Agricultural History Society's book of the year award in 1968.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 1940s & WWII ===\nIn 1941, while he was still at Florida Normal College, Pinkett published his first article in the ''[[The Journal of African American History|Journal of Negro History]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> He also began reviewing books for the journal, often addressing race and ethnicity under the umbrella of American democracy.\n\nBut in the beginning of 1942, Pinkett was approached by the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] who were looking for someone with experience in Negro history. On April 16, 1942, Pinkett began his professional position with the National Archives, the first African American to be hired as a professional with the Archives.\n\nAs he began work with the Archives, he noticed that he was the only African American doing professional or clerical work: all other black workers were employed as laborers, messengers, custodians and elevator operators.<ref name=\":0\" /> Not only that, but southerners dominated the Archives. He later referred to this as the \"Era of the Confederate Archives.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOnly [[Dwight Hillis Wilson]] and Roland C. McConnell followed Pinkett into professional careers at the Archives, and they were both only there temporarily due to the war. (McConnell left the Archives in 1947 to teach at [[Morgan State University|Morgan College]] and Wilson left in 1946 to work in Italy with the Allied Force Records Administration.)\n\nWhile he was \"a curiosity\" at the Archives, his social life was strained with segregated restaurants and other areas that restricted his presence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1943, Pinkett applied for a position in the Division of Agriculture Archives and earned the position, beating out all the other white candidates. His strong work here garnered him a promotion as an archivist, which he held from 1942-1948.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlso in 1943, Pinkett joined the [[Society of American Archivists]], which had been established in 1936. Although the society was led by white men until the 1960s, he was named an SAA Fellow in 1962, elected to the SAA Council in 1971, and was appointed editor of the ''[[American Archivist]]'' from 1968-1971.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHowever, that December, Pinkett got his draft notice. He was inducted on December 9 and served in Maryland, Massachusetts, France, Belgium, and Japan in teaching and administration positions.<ref name=\":0\" /> He achieved the rank of technical sergeant in the army and earned the Good Conduct Medal, the American Theater Ribbon, the European, African, Middle Eastern Theater Ribbon, the Atlantic-Pacific Theater Ribbon, the Army Occupation Medal (Japan) and the World War II Victory Ribbon.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile serving in the war, Pinkett struggled with the racism of the segregated army.<ref name=\":0\" /> He tried to transfer units twice, being rejected both times. He also declined to be trained as an officer as he \"had no wish to risk life and limb for a country that abrogated his civil rights.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe also continued to write while in service, for both academia and popular consumption, on topics such as race, war, the media's portrayal of African Americans, segregation and history. Near the war's end, he wrote about his experiences, saying that \"most Army Jim Crow is entirely unnecessary.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 1950s & 1960s ===\nPinkett left the army in 1946, continuing his work at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] that June. He continued to write for several publications and was named supervisory archivist in 1948, where he stayed until 1959.<ref name=\":0\" /> He also completed six inventories for the National Archives and continued to advocate for the research uses of oral history and film.\n\nIn his tenure at the Archives, he assisted scholars such as [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.|Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]], [[Merle Curti]], [[Samuel P. Hays]], Donald C. Swain, [[Roderick Nash]], and [[James Harvey Young]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1959, Pinkett applied for chief of the Agriculture and General Services Branch. He was the only black person among 25 candidates. He was promoted, but nevertheless believed it to be belated. From 1959 to 1962, Pinkett supervised the branch's archival and administrative operations.<ref name=\":0\" /> He played a pivotal role in which records were kept and which were destroyed. His work in advising researchers and government officials earned him a Commendable Service Award in 1964.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1968, after being passed over for other roles, Pinkett was promoted to Divisional Deputy Director. This is also when he took on editorial responsibilities with the ''[[American Archivist]]''. From 1970-1972, Pinkett also served as a member on the Editorial Board of the new ''[[Prologue (magazine)|Prologue: Journal of the National Archives]]'', as well as contributing articles.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1970, he served as co-director of the National Archives Conference on Research in the Administration of Public Policy to encourage the collaboration of archivists and historians.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 1970s & SAA ===\nIn 1971, Pinkett took on the leadership duties of the newly-created Natural Resources Records Branch.<ref name=\":0\" /> This transfer made him the highest-ranking African American in the General Services Administration.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy the early 1970s, African American history was an incredibly popular area of study among academies and archives. The [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] continued to grow and Pinkett shared the goals of younger advocates, but with different means. Pinkett continued to write articles, edit and review journals and even present at conferences.\n\nIn addition to his participation in the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]], he was also deeply involved with the [[Society of American Archivists]]. As Alex H. Poole explains, \"many younger members viewed SAA as sexist, elitist and homogenous: they lobbied for diversity in the profession as well as in collections.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPinkett decided to run for Vice President of the SAA, although he lost by seventeen votes. But he still remained active with the SAA, serving on the Nominating Committee (1973\u2013974), the Urban Archives Committee (as chair) (1975\u20131976), the Awards Committee (as chair) (1977\u20131978), and the American Historical Association\u2013Organization of American Historians\u2013SAA Joint Committee (1977\u20131980).<ref name=\":0\" /> He also continued to write and review for several publications.\n\nAlso in the 1970s, Pinkett served on the Agricultural History Society's Executive Committee (1972\u20131975) and the Editorial Board (1977\u20131979). He also remained active in the Forest History Society, serving on its Board of Directors for two decades (1971\u20131991) and was elected president, serving from 1976 to 1978.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe also taught at [[Howard University]] from 1970 to 1976 and at [[American University]] from 1976 to 1977.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the end of the 1970s, Pinkett saw a decrease in professionalism and scholarly investment at the National Archives and chose to retire. He later received an Exceptional Service Award.<ref name=\":0\" /> Pinkett later said he was \"not bitter\" about his lack of progression at the Archives, although he worked harder than non-black employees who received recognition and promotion. As fellow archivist [[Wilda Logan]] said, Pinkett \u201cprobably had to walk on water twice\u201d to achieve his professional positions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 1980s, 1990s & Retirement ===\nAlthough he retired from the National Archives, he stayed involved in archival work. In 1980, he helped Howard University establish its University Archives and worked as an archival consultant for African American organizations such as the National Business League (1981, 1983), the United Negro College Fund (1982, 1984), the National Urban League (1982), The Links, Inc. (1986), and the NAACP (1986\u20131987).<ref name=\":0\" /> He also worked with Cheyney University and contributed to ''The American Archivist'' and the American Library Association World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe remained an integral member of the Agricultural Historical Society and served in the Executive Committee from 1983-1986.<ref name=\":0\" /> He also presided over the society from 1982-1983. He wrote journal articles for the AHS journal, ''Agricultural History'', and continued to write book reviews for several publications.\n\nPinkett worked as a consultant for many universities and institutions throughout his retirement, including Atlanta University and the Eugene and Agnes Meyer Foundation.\n\n==Legacy==\nThroughout his career, Pinkett fought for minority representation throughout the archival profession, especially in the SAA and the National Archives. He suggested that minorities serve on the Society's committees and boards, that they recruit minorities to projects and that they publicize the findings of their Task Force on Diversity.<ref name=\":0\" /> Before the Task Force disbanded, they formed the Minorities Roundtable, later the Archivists and Archives of Color Roundtable.\n\nIn 1999, The [[Society of American Archivists]] award for minority graduate students was named after Pinkett.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www2.archivists.org/governance/handbook/section12-pinkett |title=Harold T.

He was an expert in agricultural archives, and served as president of the Agricultural History Society.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n===Ancestry===\nPinkett's ancestors were free blacks in Maryland as early as 1820, including Pinkett's great-grandfather, Denard Pinkett.<ref name=\":0\" /> Denard worked as a free laborer on a slaveowner's farm in [[Somerset County, Maryland|Somerset County]] and later married one of his slaves, Mary, with whom he had twelve children. All twelve of these children were born slaves under a Maryland slave law that stated slave status came from the mother.<ref name=\":0\" /> Adam Pinkett was one of Denard's children and was Harold T. Pinkett's grandfather.\n\nAdam fought for the Union Army in the [[American Civil War]] from 1863-1866. After the war, he was fortunate to become literate and own both land and a house. He helped found his local [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist Episcopal]] church and soon became licensed as a pastor.\n\nHarold's father, Levin Wilson Pinkett, lacked a formal education and worked as a custodian and gardener.<ref name=\":0\" /> Levin, like his father, Adam, advanced to become a pastor in the local [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist Episcopal church]].\n\n=== Early Life and Education ===\nHarold T. Pinkett was born on April 7, 1914 to Levin Wilson Pinkett and Catherine Pinkett. He was born in the segregated county of Salisbury, ravaged by [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] vigilantism. Between 1889 and 1918, whites committed seventeen lynchings and the area was named \"Mississippi on the Chesapeake.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Throughout his life, he remained committed to education, religion, and personal achievement.\n\nAs a boy, Pinkett was a newsboy for the ''Afro-American'' and also distributed issues of the ''National Association of the Advancement of Colored People's Crisis''. From 1910-1934, [[W. E. B. Du Bois|W.E.B. DuBois]] edited the ''Crisis'', which lobbied for African American civil rights and Pinkett later wrote for the publication.\n\nWhen he was sixteen, Pinkett enrolled in the Methodist institution, [[Morgan State University|Morgan College]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He was able to garner a Maryland state scholarship to pay for his tuition and he waited tables each summer to cover his rent. While at Morgan, he pledged to Omega Psi Phi, Zeta Sigma Pi and Alpha Kappa Mu. He graduated in 1935 with highest honors.<ref name=\"prolog\">{{Cite web|url=https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2016/02/18/harold-pinkett-an-archivist-and-scholar/|title=Harold Pinkett: An Archivist and Scholar|date=2016-02-18|website=Pieces of History|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref>\n\nThen he wanted to pursue a graduate education in history, but the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County|University of Maryland]] was still segregated. So in the fall of 1935, Pinkett began his graduate work at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He lived with family nearby to save money and also worked for the New Deal's National Youth Administration as a social investigator in the Public Defender's Office.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter just one year, he began teaching Latin at a Baltimore high school, where he stayed for a year and a half. The experience gave him the ambition to return to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to finish his master's degree in 1938.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, he was struggling financially and after graduation, he returned south to teach at [[Livingstone College]]. He was appointed as a sabbatical fill-in for the 1938-1939 school year. After his appointment was over, he wanted to return to school for his doctorate. The [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County|University of Maryland]] remained closed to African Americans so he enrolled in [[Columbia University]].\n\nAfter just one year at Columbia, Pinkett began to struggle financially and turned to teaching again. From 1940 to 1941, he was a faculty member at Florida Normal College in St. Augustine and taught history, government and geography.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1941, he returned to teach at Livingstone. He also began to court Lucille Cannady and they married in the spring of 1943. Lucille also worked with the federal government, working with the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] for 33 years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the war, Pinkett returned to graduate school for his doctorate. In 1948, he began his work at [[American University]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He graduated in 1953 with a PhD in history and archival administration. His dissertation was entitled \u201cGifford Pinchot and the Early Conservation Movement in the United States,\" which went on to be published by the [[University of Illinois Press]] and won the Agricultural History Society's book of the year award in 1968.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 1940s & WWII ===\nIn 1941, while he was still at Florida Normal College, Pinkett published his first article in the ''[[The Journal of African American History|Journal of Negro History]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> He also began reviewing books for the journal, often addressing race and ethnicity under the umbrella of American democracy.\n\nBut in the beginning of 1942, Pinkett was approached by the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] who were looking for someone with experience in Negro history. On April 16, 1942, Pinkett began his professional position with the National Archives, the first African American to be hired as a professional with the Archives.\n\nAs he began work with the Archives, he noticed that he was the only African American doing professional or clerical work: all other black workers were employed as laborers, messengers, custodians and elevator operators.<ref name=\":0\" /> Not only that, but southerners dominated the Archives. He later referred to this as the \"Era of the Confederate Archives.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOnly [[Dwight Hillis Wilson]] and Roland C. McConnell followed Pinkett into professional careers at the Archives, and they were both only there temporarily due to the war. (McConnell left the Archives in 1947 to teach at [[Morgan State University|Morgan College]] and Wilson left in 1946 to work in Italy with the Allied Force Records Administration.)\n\nWhile he was \"a curiosity\" at the Archives, his social life was strained with segregated restaurants and other areas that restricted his presence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1943, Pinkett applied for a position in the Division of Agriculture Archives and earned the position, beating out all the other white candidates. His strong work here garnered him a promotion as an archivist, which he held from 1942-1948.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlso in 1943, Pinkett joined the [[Society of American Archivists]], which had been established in 1936. Although the society was led by white men until the 1960s, he was named an SAA Fellow in 1962, elected to the SAA Council in 1971, and was appointed editor of the ''[[American Archivist]]'' from 1968-1971.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHowever, that December, Pinkett got his draft notice. He was inducted on December 9 and served in Maryland, Massachusetts, France, Belgium, and Japan in teaching and administration positions.<ref name=\":0\" /> He achieved the rank of technical sergeant in the army and earned the Good Conduct Medal, the American Theater Ribbon, the European, African, Middle Eastern Theater Ribbon, the Atlantic-Pacific Theater Ribbon, the Army Occupation Medal (Japan) and the World War II Victory Ribbon.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile serving in the war, Pinkett struggled with the racism of the segregated army.<ref name=\":0\" /> He tried to transfer units twice, being rejected both times. He also declined to be trained as an officer as he \"had no wish to risk life and limb for a country that abrogated his civil rights.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe also continued to write while in service, for both academia and popular consumption, on topics such as race, war, the media's portrayal of African Americans, segregation and history. Near the war's end, he wrote about his experiences, saying that \"most Army Jim Crow is entirely unnecessary.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 1950s & 1960s ===\nPinkett left the army in 1946, continuing his work at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] that June. He continued to write for several publications and was named supervisory archivist in 1948, where he stayed until 1959.<ref name=\":0\" /> He also completed six inventories for the National Archives and continued to advocate for the research uses of oral history and film.\n\nIn his tenure at the Archives, he assisted scholars such as [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.|Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]], [[Merle Curti]], [[Samuel P. Hays]], Donald C. Swain, [[Roderick Nash]], and [[James Harvey Young]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1959, Pinkett applied for chief of the Agriculture and General Services Branch. He was the only black person among 25 candidates. He was promoted, but nevertheless believed it to be belated. From 1959 to 1962, Pinkett supervised the branch's archival and administrative operations.<ref name=\":0\" /> He played a pivotal role in which records were kept and which were destroyed. His work in advising researchers and government officials earned him a Commendable Service Award in 1964.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1968, after being passed over for other roles, Pinkett was promoted to Divisional Deputy Director. This is also when he took on editorial responsibilities with the ''[[American Archivist]]''. From 1970-1972, Pinkett also served as a member on the Editorial Board of the new ''[[Prologue (magazine)|Prologue: Journal of the National Archives]]'', as well as contributing articles.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1970, he served as co-director of the National Archives Conference on Research in the Administration of Public Policy to encourage the collaboration of archivists and historians.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 1970s & SAA ===\nIn 1971, Pinkett took on the leadership duties of the newly-created Natural Resources Records Branch.<ref name=\":0\" /> This transfer made him the highest-ranking African American in the General Services Administration.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy the early 1970s, African American history was an incredibly popular area of study among academies and archives. The [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] continued to grow and Pinkett shared the goals of younger advocates, but with different means. Pinkett continued to write articles, edit and review journals and even present at conferences.\n\nIn addition to his participation in the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]], he was also deeply involved with the [[Society of American Archivists]]. As Alex H. Poole explains, \"many younger members viewed SAA as sexist, elitist and homogenous: they lobbied for diversity in the profession as well as in collections.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPinkett decided to run for Vice President of the SAA, although he lost by seventeen votes. But he still remained active with the SAA, serving on the Nominating Committee (1973\u2013974), the Urban Archives Committee (as chair) (1975\u20131976), the Awards Committee (as chair) (1977\u20131978), and the American Historical Association\u2013Organization of American Historians\u2013SAA Joint Committee (1977\u20131980).<ref name=\":0\" /> He also continued to write and review for several publications.\n\nAlso in the 1970s, Pinkett served on the Agricultural History Society's Executive Committee (1972\u20131975) and the Editorial Board (1977\u20131979). He also remained active in the Forest History Society, serving on its Board of Directors for two decades (1971\u20131991) and was elected president, serving from 1976 to 1978.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe also taught at [[Howard University]] from 1970 to 1976 and at [[American University]] from 1976 to 1977.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the end of the 1970s, Pinkett saw a decrease in professionalism and scholarly investment at the National Archives and chose to retire. He later received an Exceptional Service Award.<ref name=\":0\" /> Pinkett later said he was \"not bitter\" about his lack of progression at the Archives, although he worked harder than non-black employees who received recognition and promotion. As fellow archivist [[Wilda Logan]] said, Pinkett \u201cprobably had to walk on water twice\u201d to achieve his professional positions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== 1980s, 1990s & Retirement ===\nAlthough he retired from the National Archives, he stayed involved in archival work. In 1980, he helped Howard University establish its University Archives and worked as an archival consultant for African American organizations such as the National Business League (1981, 1983), the United Negro College Fund (1982, 1984), the National Urban League (1982), The Links, Inc. (1986), and the NAACP (1986\u20131987).<ref name=\":0\" /> He also worked with Cheyney University and contributed to ''The American Archivist'' and the American Library Association World Encyclopedia of Library and Information Services.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe remained an integral member of the Agricultural Historical Society and served in the Executive Committee from 1983-1986.<ref name=\":0\" /> He also presided over the society from 1982-1983. He wrote journal articles for the AHS journal, ''Agricultural History'', and continued to write book reviews for several publications.\n\nPinkett worked as a consultant for many universities and institutions throughout his retirement, including Atlanta University and the Eugene and Agnes Meyer Foundation.\n\n==Legacy==\nThroughout his career, Pinkett fought for minority representation throughout the archival profession, especially in the SAA and the National Archives.

At a young age, she married Agricole Breaux; and together, they had five children. In 1817, the couple replaced the Bayou Teche suspension footbridge built by Agricole's father with a vehicular bridge that allowed wagon passage and made way for the area's increasing commerce. At the age of 32, Scholastique became a widow.\n\nA determined Acadian woman, Scholastique drew up ''Plan de la Ville Du Pont des Breaux (''the plan for the Village of Breaux Bridge), which included a detailed map of the area and a diagram of streets. She developed the area by selling land lots to other [[Acadian]] settlers. In 1847, a church parish was created; and 12 years later, the area was officially incorporated. After founding the town, Scholastique remarried and birthed an additional two children.\n\n=== Breaux's Bridge ===\nAgricole's father was the Acadian pioneer [[Firmin Breaux]].  Breaux first arrived in the area during early 1765. By 1774, his branding iron was registered, and by 1786 he was one of the largest property owners in the [[Bayou Teche]] country. In 1799, Breaux built a footbridge across the Bayou Teche to help ease the passage across for his family and neighbors. This first bridge was a suspension footbridge, likely made of rope and small planks. It was stabilized by being tied to small pilings located at each end of the bridge  as well as to a pair of huge [[southern live oak|live oak]] trees on both sides of the bayou. When traveling directions were given, residents would often instruct people to ''\"go to Breaux's bridge . . .\"''  This was later adopted as the city's name.<ref name=\"History_of_Breaux_Bridge\">[http://gov.breauxbridgelive.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=52&Itemid=107 gov.breauxbridgelive.com \"History of Breaux Bridge\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104204512/http://gov.breauxbridgelive.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=52&Itemid=107|date=January 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBreaux Bridge is located at {{Coord|30|16|33|N|91|54|4|W|type:city}} (30.275939, -91.901230).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.7|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|6.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Breaux Bridge, Louisiana (4).jpg|thumb|Shops in Breaux Bridge.]]\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 443\n|1890= 654\n|1900= 654\n|1910= 1339\n|1920= 1171\n|1930= 1399\n|1940= 1668\n|1950= 2492\n|1960= 3303\n|1970= 4942\n|1980= 5922\n|1990= 6515\n|2000= 7281\n|2010= 8139\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8227\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census]], there were 8,139 people living in the city. 50.0% were [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 47.3% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.4% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.6% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.4% from some other race and 1.3% [[Multiracial American|from two or more races]]. 1.3% were [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=2013-09-11 }}</ref> of 2000, there were 7,281 people, 2,512 households, and 1,821 families living in the city.

At a young age, she married Agricole Breaux; and together, they had five children. In 1817, the couple replaced the Bayou Teche suspension footbridge built by Agricole's father with a vehicular bridge that allowed wagon passage and made way for the area's increasing commerce. At the age of 32, Scholastique became a widow.\n\nA determined Acadian woman, Scholastique drew up ''Plan de la Ville Du Pont des Breaux (''the plan for the Village of Breaux Bridge), which included a detailed map of the area and a diagram of streets. She developed the area by selling land lots to other [[Acadian]] settlers. In 1847, a church parish was created; and 12 years later, the area was officially incorporated. After founding the town, Scholastique remarried and birthed an additional two children.\n\n=== Breaux's Bridge ===\nAgricole's father was the Acadian pioneer [[Firmin Breaux]].  Breaux first arrived in the area during early 1765. By 1774, his branding iron was registered, and by 1786 he was one of the largest property owners in the [[Bayou Teche]] country. In 1799, Breaux built a footbridge across the Bayou Teche to help ease the passage across for his family and neighbors. This first bridge was a suspension footbridge, likely made of rope and small planks. It was stabilized by being tied to small pilings located at each end of the bridge  as well as to a pair of huge [[southern live oak|live oak]] trees on both sides of the bayou. When traveling directions were given, residents would often instruct people to ''\"go to Breaux's bridge . . .\"''  This was later adopted as the city's name.<ref name=\"History_of_Breaux_Bridge\">[http://gov.breauxbridgelive.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=52&Itemid=107 gov.breauxbridgelive.com \"History of Breaux Bridge\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104204512/http://gov.breauxbridgelive.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=52&Itemid=107|date=January 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBreaux Bridge is located at {{Coord|30|16|33|N|91|54|4|W|type:city}} (30.275939, -91.901230).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.7|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|6.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} is water.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Breaux Bridge, Louisiana (4).jpg|thumb|Shops in Breaux Bridge.]]\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 443\n|1890= 654\n|1900= 654\n|1910= 1339\n|1920= 1171\n|1930= 1399\n|1940= 1668\n|1950= 2492\n|1960= 3303\n|1970= 4942\n|1980= 5922\n|1990= 6515\n|2000= 7281\n|2010= 8139\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8227\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 25, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census]], there were 8,139 people living in the city. 50.0% were [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 47.3% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.4% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.6% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.4% from some other race and 1.3% [[Multiracial American|from two or more races]]. 1.3% were [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=2013-09-11 }}</ref> of 2000, there were 7,281 people, 2,512 households, and 1,821 families living in the city.
