During the [[middle ages]] Luton is recorded as being home to six water mills. Mill Street, in the town centre, takes its name from one of them.\n\n[[John of England|King John]] (1166\u20131216) had hired a [[mercenary]] soldier, [[Falkes de Breaut\u00e9]], to act on his behalf. ([[Br\u00e9aut\u00e9]] is a small town near [[Le Havre]] in France.) When he married, he acquired his wife Margaret's London house which came to be known as \"Fawkes Hall\", subsequently corrupted over the years to \"Foxhall\", then \"Vauxhall\". In return for his services, King John granted Falkes the manor of Luton. He was also granted the right to bear his own [[coat of arms]] and chose the mythical [[griffin]] as his heraldic emblem. The griffin thus became associated with both [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] and Luton in the early 13th century.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vauxhallandkennington.org.uk/history.shtml |title=Vauxhall history |access-date=22 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708200002/http://www.vauxhallandkennington.org.uk/history.shtml |archive-date=8 July 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBy 1240 the town is recorded as ''Leueton''. The town had an annual market for surrounding villages in August each year, and with the growth of the town a second [[fair]] was granted each October from 1338.\n\nIn 1336, much of Luton was destroyed by a great fire, however the town was soon rebuilt.\n\nThe agriculture base of the town changed in the 16th century with a [[brickmaking]] industry developing around Luton, many of the older wooden houses were rebuilt in brick.\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]] of the 17th century there were two incidents in Luton, the first in 1645 when royalists entered the town and demanded money and goods. Parliamentary forces arrived and during the fighting four royalist soldiers were killed and a further 22 were captured. A second skirmish occurred three years later in 1648 when a royalist army passed through Luton. A small number of which were attacked by parliamentary soldiers at an inn on the corner of Bridge Street. Most of the group of royalists escaped but nine were killed.\n\nIt was in the 17th century when the [[hatmaking]] that became synonymous with the town began. By the 18th century the hatmaking industry, especially [[straw hat]] manufacture, dominated the town as its only significant industry. Hats are still produced in the town on a smaller scale.\n\nThe first [[St Mary's Hospital, Luton|Luton Workhouse]] was built in 1722. A larger workhouse was built in the town in 1836.\n\n[[Luton Hoo]], a nearby large country house, was first built in 1767. Little of the original house remains as much of it was rebuilt after a fire in 1843.\n\n==19th century==\n[[Image:Lutonmap1888.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A map of Luton from 1888]]\nThe town grew strongly in the 19th century; in 1801 the population was 3,095.<ref>[http://www.localhistories.org/luton.html Population figures for 1801, 1901 and 1901]</ref> By 1850 it was over 10,000 and by 1901 it was almost 39,000. A railway connection was essential for this growth, and there was a long delay before this was provided. The [[London and Birmingham Railway]] (L&BR) had been built through [[Tring]] in 1838, and the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] was built through [[Hitchin]] in 1852, both bypassing Luton, the largest town in the area. A branch line connecting with the L&BR at [[Leighton Buzzard]] was proposed, but because of objections to release of land, the branch only reached Luton's much smaller rival, Dunstable, in 1848. It was another ten years before the branch was extended to [[Luton Bute Street railway station|Bute Street Station]], and the first train to Dunstable ran on 3 May 1858.<ref name=\"dyer\" />{{rp|141}} The line was later extended to [[Welwyn Garden City|Welwyn]] and from 1860 direct trains to [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] ran. The [[Midland Railway]] was extended from Bedford to [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]] through [[Leagrave railway station|Leagrave]] and [[Luton Midland Road railway station|Midland Road station]] and opened on 9 September 1867.<ref name=\"dyer\" />{{rp|142}}\n\nLuton had a gas supply in 1834, and the gas street lights were erected and the first [[town hall]] opened in 1847.\n\nNewspaper printing arrived in the town in 1854, coincidentally the year the first public cemetery was opened. Following a cholera epidemic in 1848 Luton formed a water company and had a complete water and sewerage system by the late 1860s. The first covered market was built (the Plait Halls, now demolished) in 1869. Luton was made a borough in 1876<ref>[http://www.localhistories.org/luton.html Luton was made a borough]</ref> and the football club was founded in 1885 following the passing of a resolution at the Town Hall that the \"Luton Town Club be formed\".<ref>[http://lutonfc.hostinguk.com/history.asp Formation of Luton Town] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206144907/http://lutonfc.hostinguk.com/history.asp |date=6 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==20th century==\nIn the 20th century, the hat trade severely declined and was replaced by more modern industries. In 1905, [[Vauxhall Motors]] opened the largest car plant in the United Kingdom in Luton. In 1914 [[Hewlett & Blondeau]] built an aircraft manufacturing plant in [[Leagrave]] which later became [[Electrolux]] in 1926, which set the president for further light manufacturing businesses in the town.\n\nIn 1904 councillors [[Asher Hucklesby]] and Edwin Oakley purchased the estate that became [[Wardown Park]], and then donated the property to the people of Luton. Hucklesby went on to be Mayor of Luton. The main house in the park became [[Luton Museum]].\n\nThe town had a tram system from 1908 until 1932 and the first cinema was opened in 1909. By 1914, the population reached had 50,000.\n\nThe original [[Luton Town Hall|town hall]] was destroyed in 1919 during the Peace Day celebrations at the end of the [[First World War]]; local people including many ex-servicemen were unhappy with unemployment and had been refused the use of a local park to hold celebratory events, and so stormed the town hall setting it on fire. (''See [[Luton Town Hall]]'') A replacement town hall was completed in 1936. [[Luton Airport]] opened in 1938, owned and operated by the council.\n\nIn [[World War II]], the Vauxhall Factory built [[Churchill tank]]s<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/peoples_war/vauxhall_tanks.shtml Churchill Tanks at Vauxhall]</ref> as part of the war effort and was heavily camouflaged. The Vauxhall factory made Luton a target for the [[Luftwaffe]] and the town suffered a number of [[airstrike|air raids]], although only 107 people died<ref>[http://www.localhistories.org/luton.html Deaths during WWII]</ref> there was extensive damage to the town and over 1,500 homes were damaged or destroyed. Other industry in the town such as [[SKF]] (producing ball bearings), made a vital contribution to the war effort. Although a bomb landed at the SKF Factory<ref>See book ''Luton at War volume II'',compiled by The Luton News, 2001, {{ISBN|1-871199-49-2}}</ref> no major damage was inflicted.\n[[Image:LutonTownCentre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Luton Town Centre]]\nPost-war, the [[slum clearance]] continued and a number of substantial estates of council housing were built, notably at [[Farley Hill, Bedfordshire|Farley Hill]], [[Stopsley]], [[Limbury]], [[Marsh farm]] and [[Leagrave]], ([[Hockwell Ring]]). The [[M1 motorway|M1]] passed just to the west of the town in 1959. In 1962 a new library (to replace the Carneige Library) was opened by the Queen in the corner of St Georges Square. In the late 1960s a large part of the town centre was cleared to build a large covered shopping centre, the [[Arndale Centre]], which was opened in 1972.<ref>[http://www.ins tant-car-hire.co.uk/england/luton.html Arndale opened in 1972] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819160931/http://ins/ |date=19 August 2013 }}</ref> The Arndale Centre has had a major refurbishment, including a new glass roof, which has transformed the area. In the nineties Luton was one of the hotbeds for a new dance craze 'Ceroc', that was sweeping the nation. One of its finest exponents was Mick 'The Ceroci Kid' Philpotts.\n\nIn 2000, Vauxhall announced the end of car production in Luton; the plant closed in March 2002.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1885018.stm Vauxhall closure]</ref> At its peak it had employed in excess of 30,000 people.\n\n==21st century==\nA major regeneration programme for the town centre is planned, which will include upgrades to the town's bus and train stations as well as general improvements the town's streetscape.

It is hoped this will breathe life into the town, which has been flagging with the decades of decline of the manufacturing industry in Great Britain, which Luton once thrived upon.\n\nOn the edge of Luton, near to [[Putteridge Bury]] a new high-technology office park is under construction called [[Butterfield Green]]. The former Vauxhall site is also to be re-developed as a mixed use site called [[Napier Park]], this is to feature housing, retail and entertainment use, including a new [[Regional casino|casino]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"15\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Population since 1801''' \u2013 Source: A Vision of Britain through Time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10188970&c_id=10001043&add=N |title=Luton: Total Population |accessdate=16 June 2008 |work=A Vision of Britain Through Time |publisher=Great Britain Historical GIS Project |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814083913/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10188970&c_id=10001043&add=N |archivedate=14 August 2011 }}</ref>\n|-\n!Year\n|'''1801'''\n|'''1851'''\n|'''1901'''\n|'''1911'''\n|'''1921'''\n|'''1931'''\n|'''1941'''\n|'''1951'''\n|'''1961'''\n|'''1971'''\n|'''1981'''\n|'''1991'''\n|'''2001'''\n|'''2011'''\n|-\n!Population Luton\n|2,985\n|11,067\n|31,981\n|49,315\n|57,378\n|66,762\n|84,516\n|106,999\n|132,017\n|162,928\n|163,208\n|174,567\n|184,390\n|203,201\n|}\n\n==Archaeological excavations==\nAn archaeological excavation was undertaken before the redevelopment of the Park Square campus, [[University of Bedfordshire]].<ref>Marshall-Woodley, N & Abrams, J accepted 2012, Inside Fulk de Breaute\u2019s 13th Century Castle, Bedfordshire Archaeology (formerly Bedfordshire Archaeological Journal)</ref> Records<ref>Harward, C 2010, Land at Vicarage Street, Luton, Bedfordshire, Post-Excavation Assessment and Updated Project Design, ASE Report No.: 2010051 OASIS id: 76428</ref> indicate that this area was the site of a castle built by [[Falkes de Breaut\u00e9|Fulk de Breaut\u00e9]], an [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] knight and favourite of [[John, King of England|King John]],<ref>Dyer, J & Dony, JG. 1975 The Story of Luton.

One Medieval document shows that the castle was surrounded by a moat, as there was a complaint that de Breaut\u00e9 had dammed the nearby river (presumably to help keep water in the moat) and caused serious flooding to crops and buildings belonging to the church. De Breaut\u00e9 was one of the most powerful men in the kingdom at the time, so was not overly worried by the complaints and allegedly said that he wished that the damage had been worse.\n\nAlthough called a castle, this building was probably more like a fortified [[manor house]], surrounded by a [[moat]] and earthen bank. In the interior would have been living quarters, a [[great hall]], stables and outbuildings. The line of the moat and bank was still visible in the 19th century and seems to have been rectangular in shape. Previous excavations revealed the line of the moat on the northwest side and found traces of timber buildings.\n\nUnderneath the demolished Student Union were the remains of 19th century buildings and below these, well preserved [[medieval]] features: ditches, postholes and large pits.

From the Neolithic onwards, the area seems to have been fairly thickly populated, but without any single large settlement.\n\nThe first urban settlement nearby was the small [[Roman Britain|Roman]] town of ''Durocobrivis'' at [[Dunstable]], but Roman remains in Luton itself consist only of scattered farmsteads.<ref name=\"dyer\" />{{rp|31}}.With a core of settlement at Limbury with some evidence of substantial buildings, as well as at Wigmore and Park Street.<Simco A, Survey of Bedfordshire:The Roman Period p.110> <Hudspith R, Bedfordshire Archaeological Journal 23 pp88-89 >\n\nThe foundation of Luton is usually dated to the 6th century when a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] outpost was founded on the [[River Lea]], ''Lea tun''.<ref>[http://www.localhistories.org/luton.html Early history of Luton]</ref> Although this is the usually quoted etymology, there is evidence to show that Luton is named so after the Celtic god [[Lugh]], pronounced 'loo'; the river was once called Lugh and the settlement Lugh's Town, later becoming Luton.\n\nLuton is recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] as ''Loitone'' and also as ''Lintone'',<ref>[http://www.domesdaybook.co.uk/bedfordshire2.html Domesday book record]</ref> when the town's population was around 700\u2013800.

During the [[middle ages]] Luton is recorded as being home to six water mills. Mill Street, in the town centre, takes its name from one of them.\n\n[[John of England|King John]] (1166\u20131216) had hired a [[mercenary]] soldier, [[Falkes de Breaut\u00e9]], to act on his behalf. ([[Br\u00e9aut\u00e9]] is a small town near [[Le Havre]] in France.) When he married, he acquired his wife Margaret's London house which came to be known as \"Fawkes Hall\", subsequently corrupted over the years to \"Foxhall\", then \"Vauxhall\". In return for his services, King John granted Falkes the manor of Luton. He was also granted the right to bear his own [[coat of arms]] and chose the mythical [[griffin]] as his heraldic emblem. The griffin thus became associated with both [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] and Luton in the early 13th century.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vauxhallandkennington.org.uk/history.shtml |title=Vauxhall history |access-date=22 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708200002/http://www.vauxhallandkennington.org.uk/history.shtml |archive-date=8 July 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nBy 1240 the town is recorded as ''Leueton''. The town had an annual market for surrounding villages in August each year, and with the growth of the town a second [[fair]] was granted each October from 1338.\n\nIn 1336, much of Luton was destroyed by a great fire, however the town was soon rebuilt.\n\nThe agriculture base of the town changed in the 16th century with a [[brickmaking]] industry developing around Luton, many of the older wooden houses were rebuilt in brick.\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]] of the 17th century there were two incidents in Luton, the first in 1645 when royalists entered the town and demanded money and goods. Parliamentary forces arrived and during the fighting four royalist soldiers were killed and a further 22 were captured. A second skirmish occurred three years later in 1648 when a royalist army passed through Luton. A small number of which were attacked by parliamentary soldiers at an inn on the corner of Bridge Street. Most of the group of royalists escaped but nine were killed.\n\nIt was in the 17th century when the [[hatmaking]] that became synonymous with the town began. By the 18th century the hatmaking industry, especially [[straw hat]] manufacture, dominated the town as its only significant industry. Hats are still produced in the town on a smaller scale.\n\nThe first [[St Mary's Hospital, Luton|Luton Workhouse]] was built in 1722. A larger workhouse was built in the town in 1836.\n\n[[Luton Hoo]], a nearby large country house, was first built in 1767. Little of the original house remains as much of it was rebuilt after a fire in 1843.\n\n==19th century==\n[[Image:Lutonmap1888.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A map of Luton from 1888]]\nThe town grew strongly in the 19th century; in 1801 the population was 3,095.<ref>[http://www.localhistories.org/luton.html Population figures for 1801, 1901 and 1901]</ref> By 1850 it was over 10,000 and by 1901 it was almost 39,000. A railway connection was essential for this growth, and there was a long delay before this was provided. The [[London and Birmingham Railway]] (L&BR) had been built through [[Tring]] in 1838, and the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] was built through [[Hitchin]] in 1852, both bypassing Luton, the largest town in the area. A branch line connecting with the L&BR at [[Leighton Buzzard]] was proposed, but because of objections to release of land, the branch only reached Luton's much smaller rival, Dunstable, in 1848. It was another ten years before the branch was extended to [[Luton Bute Street railway station|Bute Street Station]], and the first train to Dunstable ran on 3 May 1858.<ref name=\"dyer\" />{{rp|141}} The line was later extended to [[Welwyn Garden City|Welwyn]] and from 1860 direct trains to [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] ran. The [[Midland Railway]] was extended from Bedford to [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]] through [[Leagrave railway station|Leagrave]] and [[Luton Midland Road railway station|Midland Road station]] and opened on 9 September 1867.<ref name=\"dyer\" />{{rp|142}}\n\nLuton had a gas supply in 1834, and the gas street lights were erected and the first [[town hall]] opened in 1847.\n\nNewspaper printing arrived in the town in 1854, coincidentally the year the first public cemetery was opened. Following a cholera epidemic in 1848 Luton formed a water company and had a complete water and sewerage system by the late 1860s. The first covered market was built (the Plait Halls, now demolished) in 1869. Luton was made a borough in 1876<ref>[http://www.localhistories.org/luton.html Luton was made a borough]</ref> and the football club was founded in 1885 following the passing of a resolution at the Town Hall that the \"Luton Town Club be formed\".<ref>[http://lutonfc.hostinguk.com/history.asp Formation of Luton Town] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206144907/http://lutonfc.hostinguk.com/history.asp |date=6 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==20th century==\nIn the 20th century, the hat trade severely declined and was replaced by more modern industries. In 1905, [[Vauxhall Motors]] opened the largest car plant in the United Kingdom in Luton. In 1914 [[Hewlett & Blondeau]] built an aircraft manufacturing plant in [[Leagrave]] which later became [[Electrolux]] in 1926, which set the president for further light manufacturing businesses in the town.\n\nIn 1904 councillors [[Asher Hucklesby]] and Edwin Oakley purchased the estate that became [[Wardown Park]], and then donated the property to the people of Luton. Hucklesby went on to be Mayor of Luton. The main house in the park became [[Luton Museum]].\n\nThe town had a tram system from 1908 until 1932 and the first cinema was opened in 1909. By 1914, the population reached had 50,000.\n\nThe original [[Luton Town Hall|town hall]] was destroyed in 1919 during the Peace Day celebrations at the end of the [[First World War]]; local people including many ex-servicemen were unhappy with unemployment and had been refused the use of a local park to hold celebratory events, and so stormed the town hall setting it on fire. (''See [[Luton Town Hall]]'') A replacement town hall was completed in 1936. [[Luton Airport]] opened in 1938, owned and operated by the council.\n\nIn [[World War II]], the Vauxhall Factory built [[Churchill tank]]s<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/peoples_war/vauxhall_tanks.shtml Churchill Tanks at Vauxhall]</ref> as part of the war effort and was heavily camouflaged. The Vauxhall factory made Luton a target for the [[Luftwaffe]] and the town suffered a number of [[airstrike|air raids]], although only 107 people died<ref>[http://www.localhistories.org/luton.html Deaths during WWII]</ref> there was extensive damage to the town and over 1,500 homes were damaged or destroyed. Other industry in the town such as [[SKF]] (producing ball bearings), made a vital contribution to the war effort. Although a bomb landed at the SKF Factory<ref>See book ''Luton at War volume II'',compiled by The Luton News, 2001, {{ISBN|1-871199-49-2}}</ref> no major damage was inflicted.\n[[Image:LutonTownCentre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Luton Town Centre]]\nPost-war, the [[slum clearance]] continued and a number of substantial estates of council housing were built, notably at [[Farley Hill, Bedfordshire|Farley Hill]], [[Stopsley]], [[Limbury]], [[Marsh farm]] and [[Leagrave]], ([[Hockwell Ring]]). The [[M1 motorway|M1]] passed just to the west of the town in 1959. In 1962 a new library (to replace the Carneige Library) was opened by the Queen in the corner of St Georges Square. In the late 1960s a large part of the town centre was cleared to build a large covered shopping centre, the [[Arndale Centre]], which was opened in 1972.<ref>[http://www.ins tant-car-hire.co.uk/england/luton.html Arndale opened in 1972] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819160931/http://ins/ |date=19 August 2013 }}</ref> The Arndale Centre has had a major refurbishment, including a new glass roof, which has transformed the area. In the nineties Luton was one of the hotbeds for a new dance craze 'Ceroc', that was sweeping the nation. One of its finest exponents was Mick 'The Ceroci Kid' Philpotts.\n\nIn 2000, Vauxhall announced the end of car production in Luton; the plant closed in March 2002.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1885018.stm Vauxhall closure]</ref> At its peak it had employed in excess of 30,000 people.\n\n==21st century==\nA major regeneration programme for the town centre is planned, which will include upgrades to the town's bus and train stations as well as general improvements the town's streetscape.

It is hoped this will breathe life into the town, which has been flagging with the decades of decline of the manufacturing industry in Great Britain, which Luton once thrived upon.\n\nOn the edge of Luton, near to [[Putteridge Bury]] a new high-technology office park is under construction called [[Butterfield Green]]. The former Vauxhall site is also to be re-developed as a mixed use site called [[Napier Park]], this is to feature housing, retail and entertainment use, including a new [[Regional casino|casino]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"15\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|'''Population since 1801''' \u2013 Source: A Vision of Britain through Time<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10188970&c_id=10001043&add=N |title=Luton: Total Population |accessdate=16 June 2008 |work=A Vision of Britain Through Time |publisher=Great Britain Historical GIS Project |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814083913/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10188970&c_id=10001043&add=N |archivedate=14 August 2011 }}</ref>\n|-\n!Year\n|'''1801'''\n|'''1851'''\n|'''1901'''\n|'''1911'''\n|'''1921'''\n|'''1931'''\n|'''1941'''\n|'''1951'''\n|'''1961'''\n|'''1971'''\n|'''1981'''\n|'''1991'''\n|'''2001'''\n|'''2011'''\n|-\n!Population Luton\n|2,985\n|11,067\n|31,981\n|49,315\n|57,378\n|66,762\n|84,516\n|106,999\n|132,017\n|162,928\n|163,208\n|174,567\n|184,390\n|203,201\n|}\n\n==Archaeological excavations==\nAn archaeological excavation was undertaken before the redevelopment of the Park Square campus, [[University of Bedfordshire]].<ref>Marshall-Woodley, N & Abrams, J accepted 2012, Inside Fulk de Breaute\u2019s 13th Century Castle, Bedfordshire Archaeology (formerly Bedfordshire Archaeological Journal)</ref> Records<ref>Harward, C 2010, Land at Vicarage Street, Luton, Bedfordshire, Post-Excavation Assessment and Updated Project Design, ASE Report No.: 2010051 OASIS id: 76428</ref> indicate that this area was the site of a castle built by [[Falkes de Breaut\u00e9|Fulk de Breaut\u00e9]], an [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] knight and favourite of [[John, King of England|King John]],<ref>Dyer, J & Dony, JG. 1975 The Story of Luton. White Crescent Press Ltd, p 46</ref> some time between 1216 and 1221. One Medieval document shows that the castle was surrounded by a moat, as there was a complaint that de Breaut\u00e9 had dammed the nearby river (presumably to help keep water in the moat) and caused serious flooding to crops and buildings belonging to the church. De Breaut\u00e9 was one of the most powerful men in the kingdom at the time, so was not overly worried by the complaints and allegedly said that he wished that the damage had been worse.\n\nAlthough called a castle, this building was probably more like a fortified [[manor house]], surrounded by a [[moat]] and earthen bank. In the interior would have been living quarters, a [[great hall]], stables and outbuildings. The line of the moat and bank was still visible in the 19th century and seems to have been rectangular in shape. Previous excavations revealed the line of the moat on the northwest side and found traces of timber buildings.\n\nUnderneath the demolished Student Union were the remains of 19th century buildings and below these, well preserved [[medieval]] features: ditches, postholes and large pits.

He was born on his father's [[Bonaventure Plantation]], near [[Savannah, Georgia]]. After studying in England, he was appointed a [[midshipman]] on January 1, 1812, and attended the [[Naval academy]] at [[Washington, D.C.]], until 1 August when he was assigned to the [[frigate]] [[USS Constellation (1797)|''Constellation'']].\n\nWhen his ship tried to slip out to sea, the strong [[United Kingdom|British]] squadron operating in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] forced her to put into [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. ''Constellation'' remained bottled up in [[Hampton Roads]] for the duration of the War of 1812, but Tattnall and his comrades still managed to get into the fray. He was among the 100 or so sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] assigned to the shore battery on [[Craney Island (Virginia)|Craney Island]]. On June 22, 1813, the [[United Kingdom|British]] attempted to carry the island by storm in preparation for an attack on nearby Norfolk. Tattnall's battery and a force of American boats gave the attackers a sound rebuff that deterred the British from further attempts to take the city.\n\nIn April 1814, Midshipman Tattnall was detached from ''Constellation'' and, by August 24, was in command of a force of employees from the [[Washington Navy Yard]]. He led them into the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] in an unsuccessful effort to stop the British advance on the American capital. On October 14, he was ordered to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] for duty on [[HMS Epervier (1812)|''Epervier'']]. In May 1815, that sloop sailed for the [[Mediterranean]] with Commodore [[Stephen Decatur]]'s squadron to engage the [[Barbary Pirates]] in [[Algiers]] in the [[Second Barbary War]]. On June 17, she participated in the [[Battle off Cape Gata|capture of the frigate]] ''[[Mashouda]]'' and, two days later, of the [[brig]] [[Battle off Cape Palos|''Estedio'']]. In July, when ''Epervier'' was ordered back to the United States with dispatches, Tattnall remained in the Mediterranean in ''Constellation''. In January 1817, he transferred to [[USS Ontario (1813)|''Ontario'']] and returned in her to the United States.\n\n==Interwar years, 1818\u20131845==\nPromoted to lieutenant on April 1, 1818, Tattnall was assigned to the frigate [[USS Macedonian (1810)|''Macedonian'']] on June 30, and he sailed in her for the [[Pacific]] in November. He was detached from ''Macedonian'' on August 30, 1820, and returned to the United States. Ordered to Norfolk on December 26, 1822, he joined Commodore [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]'s squadron in [[schooner]] [[USS Jackall (1823)|''Jackall'']]. Lieutenant Tattnall served in the [[West Indies]] on an expedition to suppress piracy until he was detached on May 4, 1823. On June 23, 1824, Tattnall was ordered to ''Constitution'' for Mediterranean service. In March 1826, he transferred to [[USS Brandywine|''Brandywine'']] and returned home in her in May. On the 15th of that month, he was granted six months leave, which was later extended into 1828.\n\nTattnall served in [[USS Erie (1813)|''Erie'']] from October 1828 to August 1829 and then went on to survey the [[Dry Tortugas|Tortugas]] until March 1830. Lt. Tattnall took command of schooner [[USS Grampus (1820)|''Grampus'']] on April 15, 1831, and cruised the West Indies and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In August 1832, he captured the Mexican schooner, [[Montezuma (ship)|''Montezuma'']], which had boarded and robbed an American ship on the high seas. He was detached from ''Grampus'' in September 1832 and went on leave awaiting orders for almost four years before being ordered in, July 1836, to recruit men for Captain [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]]' survey and exploration expedition.\n\nTattnall was promoted to commander on February 25, 1836, and, in April, reported for a three-year tour of duty at the [[Boston Navy Yard]].\n\n==Mexican\u2013American War==\nFollowing service with the [[Mediterranean Squadron (United States)|Mediterranean]] and [[African Squadron|African squadrons]], Commander Tattnall joined the [[Mosquito Division]] in the Gulf of Mexico in 1846, commanding the steam gunboat, [[USS Spitfire (1846)|''Spitfire'']]. During the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], he took part in the attacks on [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]], [[San Juan d'Ulloa]], and [[Tuxpan]], and he suffered an arm wound. For his gallantry before Vera Cruz, the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] presented him with a sword.\n\n==Interwar years, 1848\u20131860==\n[[File:Josiah Tattnall, pre-Civil War.png|thumb|right|250px|Portrait showing him in pre-Civil War uniform.]]\n\nIn 1848 and 1849, he returned to shore duty at the Boston Navy Yard. On February 5, 1850, he was commissioned captain and, the following month, was given command of [[USS Saranac (1848)|''Saranac'']]. Next, he commanded the [[Pensacola Navy Yard]] from July 1851 to June 1854. From August 1854 to November 1855, Captain Tattnall was flag captain in [[USS Independence (1814)|''Independence'']] to Commodore [[William Mervine]] with the [[Pacific Squadron]]. At [[Hong Kong]] on January 29, 1858, he relieved Commodore [[James Armstrong (Commodore)|James Armstrong]] taking command of the [[East India Squadron]], breaking his flag in [[USS San Jacinto (1850)|''San Jacinto'']].

Tattnall held command of the [[Sackett's Harbor Station]]. Though he opposed secession, Tattnall resigned his commission on February 21, 1861. A week later, Governor [[Joseph E. Brown]] commissioned Tattnall as the senior flag officer of the Navy of Georgia. On March 26, 1861, he received his commission as a captain in the [[Confederate Navy]]. Tattnall commanded Southern naval units during the defense of [[Port Royal, South Carolina|Port Royal]] until the harbor was captured by Union forces on 7 November 1861. From there, he moved to overall command of the defense of [[Virginia]]'s waters early in March 1862. Tattnall, by then a flag officer in the Confederate Navy as well as the Navy of Georgia, directed [[CSS Jamestown|CSS ''Jamestown'']] and other warships in captures of Federal merchantmen off [[Sewell's Point]] in April 1862.\n\nOn May 11, 1862, in the face of advancing Federal forces, Flag Officer Tattnall ordered the destruction of his [[flagship]], [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] (ex-''Merrimack''). He was later acquitted by a court martial of all charges stemming from that action. He resumed command of the naval forces of Georgia on May 29, 1862, and retained it until 31 March 1863, when he turned over command of forces afloat to Comdr. [[Richard L. Page]] and concentrated upon the shore defenses of Savannah. When Savannah fell to General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s troops, Tattnall became a prisoner of war.\n\nHe was paroled on May 9, 1865, and, soon thereafter, took up residence once more in Savannah.\n\n==Death==\nTattnall died in Savannah on June 14, 1871, and was buried in [[Bonaventure Cemetery]].

He was born on his father's [[Bonaventure Plantation]], near [[Savannah, Georgia]]. After studying in England, he was appointed a [[midshipman]] on January 1, 1812, and attended the [[Naval academy]] at [[Washington, D.C.]], until 1 August when he was assigned to the [[frigate]] [[USS Constellation (1797)|''Constellation'']].\n\nWhen his ship tried to slip out to sea, the strong [[United Kingdom|British]] squadron operating in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] forced her to put into [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. ''Constellation'' remained bottled up in [[Hampton Roads]] for the duration of the War of 1812, but Tattnall and his comrades still managed to get into the fray. He was among the 100 or so sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] assigned to the shore battery on [[Craney Island (Virginia)|Craney Island]]. On June 22, 1813, the [[United Kingdom|British]] attempted to carry the island by storm in preparation for an attack on nearby Norfolk. Tattnall's battery and a force of American boats gave the attackers a sound rebuff that deterred the British from further attempts to take the city.\n\nIn April 1814, Midshipman Tattnall was detached from ''Constellation'' and, by August 24, was in command of a force of employees from the [[Washington Navy Yard]]. He led them into the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] in an unsuccessful effort to stop the British advance on the American capital. On October 14, he was ordered to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] for duty on [[HMS Epervier (1812)|''Epervier'']]. In May 1815, that sloop sailed for the [[Mediterranean]] with Commodore [[Stephen Decatur]]'s squadron to engage the [[Barbary Pirates]] in [[Algiers]] in the [[Second Barbary War]]. On June 17, she participated in the [[Battle off Cape Gata|capture of the frigate]] ''[[Mashouda]]'' and, two days later, of the [[brig]] [[Battle off Cape Palos|''Estedio'']]. In July, when ''Epervier'' was ordered back to the United States with dispatches, Tattnall remained in the Mediterranean in ''Constellation''. In January 1817, he transferred to [[USS Ontario (1813)|''Ontario'']] and returned in her to the United States.\n\n==Interwar years, 1818\u20131845==\nPromoted to lieutenant on April 1, 1818, Tattnall was assigned to the frigate [[USS Macedonian (1810)|''Macedonian'']] on June 30, and he sailed in her for the [[Pacific]] in November. He was detached from ''Macedonian'' on August 30, 1820, and returned to the United States. Ordered to Norfolk on December 26, 1822, he joined Commodore [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]'s squadron in [[schooner]] [[USS Jackall (1823)|''Jackall'']]. Lieutenant Tattnall served in the [[West Indies]] on an expedition to suppress piracy until he was detached on May 4, 1823. On June 23, 1824, Tattnall was ordered to ''Constitution'' for Mediterranean service. In March 1826, he transferred to [[USS Brandywine|''Brandywine'']] and returned home in her in May. On the 15th of that month, he was granted six months leave, which was later extended into 1828.\n\nTattnall served in [[USS Erie (1813)|''Erie'']] from October 1828 to August 1829 and then went on to survey the [[Dry Tortugas|Tortugas]] until March 1830. Lt. Tattnall took command of schooner [[USS Grampus (1820)|''Grampus'']] on April 15, 1831, and cruised the West Indies and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In August 1832, he captured the Mexican schooner, [[Montezuma (ship)|''Montezuma'']], which had boarded and robbed an American ship on the high seas. He was detached from ''Grampus'' in September 1832 and went on leave awaiting orders for almost four years before being ordered in, July 1836, to recruit men for Captain [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]]' survey and exploration expedition.\n\nTattnall was promoted to commander on February 25, 1836, and, in April, reported for a three-year tour of duty at the [[Boston Navy Yard]].\n\n==Mexican\u2013American War==\nFollowing service with the [[Mediterranean Squadron (United States)|Mediterranean]] and [[African Squadron|African squadrons]], Commander Tattnall joined the [[Mosquito Division]] in the Gulf of Mexico in 1846, commanding the steam gunboat, [[USS Spitfire (1846)|''Spitfire'']]. During the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], he took part in the attacks on [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Vera Cruz]], [[San Juan d'Ulloa]], and [[Tuxpan]], and he suffered an arm wound. For his gallantry before Vera Cruz, the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] presented him with a sword.\n\n==Interwar years, 1848\u20131860==\n[[File:Josiah Tattnall, pre-Civil War.png|thumb|right|250px|Portrait showing him in pre-Civil War uniform.]]\n\nIn 1848 and 1849, he returned to shore duty at the Boston Navy Yard. On February 5, 1850, he was commissioned captain and, the following month, was given command of [[USS Saranac (1848)|''Saranac'']]. Next, he commanded the [[Pensacola Navy Yard]] from July 1851 to June 1854. From August 1854 to November 1855, Captain Tattnall was flag captain in [[USS Independence (1814)|''Independence'']] to Commodore [[William Mervine]] with the [[Pacific Squadron]]. At [[Hong Kong]] on January 29, 1858, he relieved Commodore [[James Armstrong (Commodore)|James Armstrong]] taking command of the [[East India Squadron]], breaking his flag in [[USS San Jacinto (1850)|''San Jacinto'']]. During his two years in the [[Far East]], Commodore Tattnall violated American neutrality while commanding the chartered steamer ''Toey-Wan'', when he came to the assistance of a British and French squadron [[Battle of Taku Forts (1859)|under fire]] from the [[Taku Forts]] at the mouth of the [[Hai River|Pei Ho]] or Hai River.
