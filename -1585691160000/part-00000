This case concerned two major issues: whether or not the city's policy regarding the supply of free basic water, 6 kilolitres per month to each account holder in the city was in conflict with Section 27 of the South African Constitution or Section 11 of the Water Services Act.<ref>[http://www.dwaf.gov.za/Documents/Legislature/a108-97.pdf], South African Water Services Act. [No. 108 of 1997] Section 11</ref> The second issue being whether or not the installation of pre-paid water meters was lawful.\nIt was held in the [[High Court of South Africa|High Court]] that the city's by-laws did not provide for the installation of meters and that their installation was unlawful. Further, as the meters halted supply of water to residence once the free basic water supply had ended, this was deemed an unlawful discontinuation of the water supply.  The court held the residents of Phiri should be provided with a free basic water supply of 50 litres per person per day.<ref>[http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPHC/2008/491.pdf ''Mazibuko v.

Therefore, the minimum content set out by the regulation 3(b) is constitutional, rendering the bodies to deviate upwards and further it is inappropriate for a court to determine the achievement of any social and economic right the government has taken steps to implement.<ref>[http://www.saflii.org/cgi-bin/disp.pl?file=za/cases/ZACC/2009/28.html&query=mazibuko ''Mazibuko and Other v.

Therefore the having access to pure and adequate quantity of water is the inalienable human right. Hence, the [[Eco Needs Foundation]] (ENF) deems it necessary to recognise the right to water (with ensured per capita minimum quantity of water) through the appropriate expressed legal provision. The [[United Nations]] with its several covenants has made it obligatory for all the nations to ensure equitable distribution of water amongst all the citizens. Accordingly, the ENF began to observe and promote the celebration of [[World Rights to Water Day]] on 20 March, the date on which Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar (\"the father of modern India\") led the world's first [[satyagraha]] for water in 1927. The World Right to Water Day calls for the adoption of special legislation establishing the universal right to water.

City of Auburn, New York'', a single mother named Diane Pilchen was living as a rental tenant in a foreclosed house, in which the owner (landlord) of the house had failed to pay the water bill for some time.  The City of Auburn billed Pilchen for the landlord's arrears, and repeatedly shut her water service off without notice when she couldn't pay these debts, making the house uninhabitable.  The city condemned the home and forced Pilchen and her child to move out.  Pilchen was represented by the Public Utility Law Project of New York (PULP) in the lawsuit.  The City of Auburn attempted unsuccessfully to argue that water is not a constitutional right because bottled water could be used instead, an argument that was contested by PULP as absurd. In 2010, Pilchen won summary judgment in which it was determined that shutting off the water violated her constitutional rights, and that Pilchen could not be billed and stopped from having water due to an unrelated party's delays in paying water bills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pulpnetwork.blogspot.com/2010/08/city-of-auburn-violated-tenants.html|title=NEW YORK'S UTILITY PROJECT : City of Auburn Violated Tenant's Constitutional Rights in Denial and Termination of Water Service|last=Norlander|first=Gerry|date=2010-08-05|website=NEW YORK'S UTILITY PROJECT|access-date=2019-06-17}}</ref><ref>http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020100806950/PILCHEN%20v.%20CITY%20OF%20AUBURN,%20N.Y.</ref>\n\n== Remaining discussions ==\n\n=== Transboundary effects ===\nGiven the fact that access to water is a cross-border source of concern and potential conflict in the [[Middle East]], the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] and parts of [[North America]] amongst other places, some non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]s) and scholars argue that the right to water also has a trans-national or extraterritorial aspect. They argue that given the fact that water supplies naturally overlap and cross borders, states also have a legal obligation not to act in a way that might have a negative effect on the enjoyment of human rights in other states.<ref>Hausmann, Ute, Globalising economic and social human rights by strengthening extraterritorial state obligations (Brot f\u00fcr die Welt, FIAN and CEED, October 2006), available at: http://fian.org/resources/documents/others/germanys-extraterritorial-human-rights-obligations-in-multilateral-development-banks/pdf</ref> The formal acknowledgement of this legal obligation could prevent the negative effects of the global \"water crunch\" (as a future threat and one negative result of human [[over-population]]).[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/pp091805.shtml]\nWater shortages and increasing consumption of freshwater make this right incredibly complicated.

Market environmentalism uses the markets as a solution to environmental problems such as [[environmental degradation]] and an inefficient use of resources. Supporters of market [[environmentalism]] believe that the managing of water as an economic good by private companies will be more effective than political accountability by citizens through their representatives. The opponents believe that the consequence of water being a human right excludes private sector involvement and requires that water should be given to all people because it is essential to life. Access to water as a human right is used by some NGOs as a means to combat privatization efforts. A human right to water \"generally rests on two justifications: the non-substitutability of drinking water (\"essential for life\"), and the fact that many other human rights which are explicitly recognized in the UN Conventions are predicated upon an (assumed) availability of water (e.g. the [[right to food]]).\"<ref name=\"ref4\">Bakker, Karen. \"The \u201cCommons\u201d Versus the \u201cCommodity\u201d: Alter\u2010globalization, Anti\u2010privatization and the Human Right to Water in the Global South\".

Although the cases regard questions of investment, commentators have noted that the indirect impact of the right to water upon the verdicts is significant.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=hUwgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA296&lpg=PA296&dq=Azurix+Corp+v+Argentina+right+to+water&source=bl&ots=XoLKHTEWxm&sig=yWaUyOJ_lW-6ukbZ7cKloySEvtk&hl=ru&sa=X&ei=S2FnU5PgIIH1kQX7pYGABQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Azurix%20Corp%20v%20Argentina%20right%20to%20water&f=false], Global Public Interest in International Investment Law, Andreas Kulick, 2012 at 303.</ref> World Bank data shows that [[water privatization]] spiked starting in the 1990's and significant growth in privatization continued into the 2000's.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bakker|first=Karen|date=27 Feb 2013|title=Neoliberal Versus Postneoliberal Water: Geographies of Privatization and Resistance|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=103|issue=2|pages=253\u2013260|doi=10.1080/00045608.2013.756246}}</ref>\n\n====''Azurix Corp v. Argentina''====\nThe first notable case regarding the right to water in the ICSID is that of ''Azurix Corp v. Argentina''.<ref>[https://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&actionVal=showDoc&docId=DC507_En&caseId=C5 ''Azurix Corp v.

A consideration in regard to the right to water is implicitly made during the arbitration for compensation, where it was held that Azurix was entitled to a fair return on the market value of the investment. This was rather than the requested US$438.6 million, citing that a reasonable business person could not expect such a return, given the limits of water price increases and improvements that would be required to ensure a well-functioning, clean water system.<ref>[https://icsid.worldbank.org/ICSID/FrontServlet?requestType=CasesRH&actionVal=showDoc&docId=DC507_En&caseId=C5], Azurix Corp v Argentina ICSID Case No ARB/01/12 at 149.</ref>\n\n====''Biwater Gauff Ltd v.

This contract was for the operation and management of the Dar es Salaam water system. In May 2005, the Tanzania government ended the contract with Biwater Gauff for its alleged failure to meet performance guarantees.  in July 2008, the Tribunal issued its decision on the case, declaring that the Tanzania government had violated the agreement with Biwater Gauff.<ref>[http://www.business-humanrights.org/Categories/Lawlawsuits/Lawsuitsregulatoryaction/LawsuitsSelectedcases/Biwater-Tanzaniaarbitration],  Business & Human RIghts Resource Centre, Biwater-Tanzania arbitration.</ref> It did not however award monetary damages to Biwater, acknowledging that public interest concerns were paramount in the dispute.\n\n== Right to water in domestic law ==\nWithout the existence of an international body that can enforce it, the human right to water relies upon the activity of national courts.<ref>[http://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&context=lucilr],  McGraw, George S. \"Defining and Defending the Right to Water and its Minimum Core: Legal Construction and the Role of National Jurisprudence\" ''Loyola University Chicago International Law Review'' Vol. 8, No. 2, 127-204 (2011) at 137.</ref> The basis for this has been established through the constitutionalisation of economic, social and cultural Rights ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ESCR]]) through one of two means: as \"directive principles\" that are goals and are often non-justiciable; or as expressly protected and enforceable through the courts.<ref>[http://www.kaupapature.org.nz/store/doc/Pickard_-_Poole.pdf], Natalie Baird and Diana Pickard \"Economic, social and cultural rights: a proposal for a constitutional peg in the ground\" [2013] NZLJ 289 at 297</ref>\n\n=== South Africa ===\nIn [[South Africa]], the right to water is enshrined in the [[Constitution of South Africa|constitution]] and implemented by ordinary statutes. This is evidence of a slight modification of the second technique of constitutionalisation referred to as the \"subsidiary legislation model\". This means that a large portion of the content and implementation of the right is done an ordinary domestic statute with some constitutional standing.<ref name=\"kaupapature.org.nz\">[http://www.kaupapature.org.nz/store/doc/Pickard_-_Poole.pdf], Natalie Baird and Diana Pickard \"Economic, social and cultural rights: a proposal for a constitutional peg in the ground\" [2013] NZLJ 289 at 298</ref>\n\n====''Residents of Bon Vista Mansions v. Southern Metropolitan Local Council''====\nThe first notable case in which the courts did so was the ''Residents of Bon Vista Mansions v.

The court held that in adherence to the [[South African Constitution]], that constitutionally all persons ought to have access to water as a right.<ref>[http://www.gov.za/documents/constitution/1996/a108-96.pdf], South African Constitution, Section 27(1)(a).</ref>\n\nFurther reasoning for the decision was based on General Comment 12 on the Right to Food, made by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights imposing upon parties to the agreement the obligation to observe and respect already existing access to adequate food by not implementing any encroaching measures.<ref>[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/gencomm/escgencom12.htm],  \nCommittee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment 12, Right to adequate food (Twentieth session, 1999), U.N.

City of Johannesburg''====\nThe quantity of water to be provided was further discussed in ''Mazibuko v. City of Johannesburg''.<ref>[http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPHC/2008/491.pdf ''Mazibuko v. City of Johannesburg''], (06/13865) [2008] ZAGPHC 491;[2008] All SA 471 (W) (30 April 2008)</ref> The case revolved around the distribution of water through pipes to Phiri, one of the oldest areas of Soweto. This case concerned two major issues: whether or not the city's policy regarding the supply of free basic water, 6 kilolitres per month to each account holder in the city was in conflict with Section 27 of the South African Constitution or Section 11 of the Water Services Act.<ref>[http://www.dwaf.gov.za/Documents/Legislature/a108-97.pdf], South African Water Services Act. [No. 108 of 1997] Section 11</ref> The second issue being whether or not the installation of pre-paid water meters was lawful.\nIt was held in the [[High Court of South Africa|High Court]] that the city's by-laws did not provide for the installation of meters and that their installation was unlawful. Further, as the meters halted supply of water to residence once the free basic water supply had ended, this was deemed an unlawful discontinuation of the water supply.  The court held the residents of Phiri should be provided with a free basic water supply of 50 litres per person per day.<ref>[http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZAGPHC/2008/491.pdf ''Mazibuko v. City of Johannesburg''], (06/13865) [2008] ZAGPHC 491;[2008] All SA 471 (W) (30 April 2008) at 181</ref> The work of the Centre for Applied Legal Studies (CALS) of the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in Johannesburg, South Africa and the [[Pacific Institute]] in Oakland, California shared a 2008 Business Ethics Network BENNY Award for their work on this case.<ref>[http://businessethicsnetwork.org/] Business Ethics Network</ref> The Pacific Institute contributed legal testimony based on the work of Dr. Peter Gleick defining a human right to water and quantifying basic human needs for water.<ref>[http://pacinst.org/news/350/], Pacific Institute \"Pacific Institute Shares BENNY Award for Efforts in South African Water Rights Decision.\" (2008), Pacific Institute, Oakland, California</ref>\n\nThe respondents took the case to the Supreme Court of Appeal ([[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|SCA]]) which held that the city's water policy had been formulated based upon a material error of law in regards to the city's obligation to provide the minimum set in the South African National Standard, therefore it was set aside.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/sites/PEG/docs/PEG%20Documents/10_SANS1-1.pdf?stdsid=14017755&pid=free, South African National Standard 3(b)]</ref> The court also held the quantity for dignified human existence in compliance with section 27 of the constitution was in fact 42 litres per person per day rather than 50 litres per person per day. The SCA declared that the installation of water meters was illegal, but suspended the order for two years to give the city an opportunity to rectify the situation.<ref>[http://www.saflii.org/cgi-bin/disp.pl?file=za/cases/ZASCA/2009/52.html&query=mazibuko], Mazibuko and Another v National Director of Public Prosecutions (113/08) [2009] ZASCA 52; 2009 (6) SA 479 (SCA) ;  [2009] 3 All SA 548 (SCA) (26 May 2009)</ref>\n\nThe issues went further to the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], which held that the duty created by the constitution required that the state take reasonable legislative and other measures progressively to realise the achievement of the right to access of water, within its available resource. the Constitutional Court also held that it is a matter for the legislature and executive institution of government to act within the allowance of their budgets and that the scrutiny of their programs is a matter of democratic [[accountability]]. Therefore, the minimum content set out by the regulation 3(b) is constitutional, rendering the bodies to deviate upwards and further it is inappropriate for a court to determine the achievement of any social and economic right the government has taken steps to implement.<ref>[http://www.saflii.org/cgi-bin/disp.pl?file=za/cases/ZACC/2009/28.html&query=mazibuko ''Mazibuko and Other v.

State of Haryana''====\nHere a water usage dispute arose due to the fact that the state of Haryana was using the Jamuna River for irrigation, while the residents of Delhi needed it for the purpose of drinking.

State of Bihar'', where a discharge of sludge from the washeries into the Bokaro River was petitioned against by way of public interest litigation. The courts found that the [[right to life]], as protected by Article 21 of the Constitution of India, included the right to enjoy pollution-free water.<ref>[http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/coi-indexenglish.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402064301/http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/coi-indexenglish.htm |date=2 April 2012 }}, The Constitution of India</ref> The case failed upon the facts and it was held that the petition had been filed not in any public interest but for the petitioner's personal interest and therefore a continuation of litigation would amount to an abuse of process.<ref name=\"indiankanoon.org\"/>\n\n====World Rights to Water Day====\nWater is essential for existence of living beings including humans. Therefore the having access to pure and adequate quantity of water is the inalienable human right. Hence, the [[Eco Needs Foundation]] (ENF) deems it necessary to recognise the right to water (with ensured per capita minimum quantity of water) through the appropriate expressed legal provision. The [[United Nations]] with its several covenants has made it obligatory for all the nations to ensure equitable distribution of water amongst all the citizens. Accordingly, the ENF began to observe and promote the celebration of [[World Rights to Water Day]] on 20 March, the date on which Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar (\"the father of modern India\") led the world's first [[satyagraha]] for water in 1927. The World Right to Water Day calls for the adoption of special legislation establishing the universal right to water. Under the guidance of founder Dr [[Priyanand Agale]], the ENF arranges a variety of several programmes to ensure the right to water for Indian citizens.<ref>econeeds.org</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\nESCR are not explicitly protected in New Zealand at the current time, either by the Human Rights or Bill of Rights Acts, therefore the right to water is not defended by law there.<ref>Natalie Baird and Diana Pickard, [http://www.kaupapature.org.nz/store/doc/Pickard_-_Poole.pdf \"Economic, social and cultural rights: a proposal for a constitutional peg in the ground\"], [2013] NZLJ 289 at 299</ref> The New Zealand Law Society has recently indicated that this country would give further consideration to the legal status of economic, social and cultural rights.<ref>[http://www.lawsociety.org.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/76530/l-HR-Committee-ICCPR-List-of-Issues-Prior-to-Reporting-5-3-14-with-annexure,-UPR-submission-17-6-13.pdf], New Zealand Law Society Human Rights & Privacy Committee, Submission to the 18th Session of The Human Rights Council, Shadow Report to New Zealnd's 2nd Universal Periodic Review</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn ''Pilchen v. City of Auburn, New York'', a single mother named Diane Pilchen was living as a rental tenant in a foreclosed house, in which the owner (landlord) of the house had failed to pay the water bill for some time.  The City of Auburn billed Pilchen for the landlord's arrears, and repeatedly shut her water service off without notice when she couldn't pay these debts, making the house uninhabitable.  The city condemned the home and forced Pilchen and her child to move out.  Pilchen was represented by the Public Utility Law Project of New York (PULP) in the lawsuit.  The City of Auburn attempted unsuccessfully to argue that water is not a constitutional right because bottled water could be used instead, an argument that was contested by PULP as absurd. In 2010, Pilchen won summary judgment in which it was determined that shutting off the water violated her constitutional rights, and that Pilchen could not be billed and stopped from having water due to an unrelated party's delays in paying water bills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pulpnetwork.blogspot.com/2010/08/city-of-auburn-violated-tenants.html|title=NEW YORK'S UTILITY PROJECT : City of Auburn Violated Tenant's Constitutional Rights in Denial and Termination of Water Service|last=Norlander|first=Gerry|date=2010-08-05|website=NEW YORK'S UTILITY PROJECT|access-date=2019-06-17}}</ref><ref>http://www.leagle.com/decision/In%20FDCO%2020100806950/PILCHEN%20v.%20CITY%20OF%20AUBURN,%20N.Y.</ref>\n\n== Remaining discussions ==\n\n=== Transboundary effects ===\nGiven the fact that access to water is a cross-border source of concern and potential conflict in the [[Middle East]], the Eastern [[Mediterranean]] and parts of [[North America]] amongst other places, some non-governmental organizations ([[NGO]]s) and scholars argue that the right to water also has a trans-national or extraterritorial aspect. They argue that given the fact that water supplies naturally overlap and cross borders, states also have a legal obligation not to act in a way that might have a negative effect on the enjoyment of human rights in other states.<ref>Hausmann, Ute, Globalising economic and social human rights by strengthening extraterritorial state obligations (Brot f\u00fcr die Welt, FIAN and CEED, October 2006), available at: http://fian.org/resources/documents/others/germanys-extraterritorial-human-rights-obligations-in-multilateral-development-banks/pdf</ref> The formal acknowledgement of this legal obligation could prevent the negative effects of the global \"water crunch\" (as a future threat and one negative result of human [[over-population]]).[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/civilsociety/articles/pp091805.shtml]\nWater shortages and increasing consumption of freshwater make this right incredibly complicated.

Rev.'' 5 (1992): 1.</ref>\n\n=== Water rights trading ===\nThe commercialization of water is offered as a response to the increased scarcity of water that has resulted due to the world population tripling while the demand for water has increased six-fold. Market environmentalism uses the markets as a solution to environmental problems such as [[environmental degradation]] and an inefficient use of resources. Supporters of market [[environmentalism]] believe that the managing of water as an economic good by private companies will be more effective than political accountability by citizens through their representatives. The opponents believe that the consequence of water being a human right excludes private sector involvement and requires that water should be given to all people because it is essential to life. Access to water as a human right is used by some NGOs as a means to combat privatization efforts. A human right to water \"generally rests on two justifications: the non-substitutability of drinking water (\"essential for life\"), and the fact that many other human rights which are explicitly recognized in the UN Conventions are predicated upon an (assumed) availability of water (e.g. the [[right to food]]).\"<ref name=\"ref4\">Bakker, Karen. \"The \u201cCommons\u201d Versus the \u201cCommodity\u201d: Alter\u2010globalization, Anti\u2010privatization and the Human Right to Water in the Global South\".

The clinical years, the third and fourth years, consist of [[Clerkship (medicine)|core clinical training]] and [[sub-internship]]s in the clinical specialties. \n\nOsteopathic medical school accreditation standards require training in [[internal medicine]], [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrics/gynecology]], [[pediatrics]], [[family medicine]], [[surgery]], [[psychiatry]], [[emergency medicine]], [[radiology]], [[preventive medicine]], and [[public health]].<ref name=curriculum>{{cite web|title=Overview of Osteopathic Medical Education/Accreditation/The Four-Year Curriculum (2012 Osteopathic Medical College Information Book) |url=http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/cib/Documents/2012cib/2012cib-p8.pdf |publisher=American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine|date=2012}}</ref> According to [[Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine]], \"the training, practice, credentialing, licensure, and reimbursement of osteopathic physicians is virtually indistinguishable from those of physicians with MD qualifications, with 4 years of osteopathic medical school followed by specialty and subspecialty training and [[board certification]]\".<ref name=Harrisons />\n\nDO schools provide an additional 300\u2013500 hours in the study of hands-on manual medicine and the body's musculoskeletal system, which is referred to as [[osteopathic manipulative medicine]] (OMM).<ref name=Medline>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002020.htm |title=Doctor of Osteopathic medicine (D.O.) |author=MedLine Plus |date=2007 |work=National Institutes of Health |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health |accessdate=June 28, 2012}}</ref> Osteopathic physicians use OMM predominantly to treat musculoskeletal conditions.\n===Examinations===\nBefore entering osteopathic medical school, an applicant must complete a four-year undergraduate degree and take a national standardized exam called the [[Medical College Admissions Test]] (MCAT).

The first single, \"Spin the Black Circle\", was released before the album was released, and on the back of the single it states \"From the Epic album ''Life''\". The album title ''Vitalogy'' comes from an early 20th-century medical book on which the cover art and [[liner notes]] are based.<ref name=\"tenpast\">Weisbard, Eric, et al. \"Ten Past Ten\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. August 2001.</ref> ''Vitalogy'' literally means \"the study of life\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nVedder found the medical book at a garage sale. Ament stated, \"Ed brought in that book, and we said man that would make a great album cover.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> He explained that from ''Vs.'' onward the band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records. Ament said, \"We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.<ref name=\"tenpast\" />\n\nThe booklet contains outdated discussions of health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, seem to be more personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one (\"I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I just wanted to tell you the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me.\"). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or should not be lived. An example is the poem typed on the \"Aye Davanita\" page. The song's subtitle is \"The song without words\", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of \"intruder words\" is on the \"Not for You\" lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the [[Sisyphus]] myth (\"Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock\"). The lyrics to \"Whipping\" are written on a copy of a petition to [[Bill Clinton]] against \"pro-life\" killings of [[abortion]] doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for \"Corduroy\".<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/>\n\n==Tour==\n{{Main|Vitalogy Tour}}\nPearl Jam promoted the album with tours in [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], and the [[United States]] in 1995.<ref>[http://pearljam.com/tour/shows.php Pearl Jam: Set Lists]. pearljam.com.</ref> The band was joined by new drummer [[Jack Irons]]. The short tour of the United States focused on the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].

Ament said that the band and its crew had to \"[build] shows from the ground up, a venue everywhere we went\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at [[San Francisco]], [[California]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering from the effects of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]. Vedder left the hospital to play the show; however he was not able to finish and ended up performing just seven out of 21 songs with the band.<ref>[http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t1995.shtml \"1995 Concert Chronology\"]. fivehorizons.com.</ref> [[Neil Young]] filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, \"That whole [Golden Gate Park] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [Young] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States.<ref name=\"wayout\"/> Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall.

Pearl Jam wrote and recorded ''Vitalogy'' while touring behind its previous album ''[[Vs. (Pearl Jam album)|Vs.]]'' (1993). The music on the record was more diverse than previous releases, and consists of aggressive rock songs, ballads and other elements making it Pearl Jam's most experimental album to date.\n\nThe album was first released on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]], followed by a release on [[Compact disc|CD]] and [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] two weeks later on December 6, 1994. The LP sold 34,000 copies in its first week of release, and until [[Jack White]]'s 2014 album ''[[Lazaretto (album)|Lazaretto]]'' it held the record for most vinyl sales in one week since SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991.<ref name=\"billboard6-18-2014\">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6121606/jack-white-lazaretto-debuts-billboard-200-sets-vinyl-sales-record |title=Jack White's 'Lazaretto' Debuts at No. 1, Sets Vinyl Sales Record |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |date=June 18, 2014}}</ref> Upon its CD release, ''Vitalogy'' became the second-fastest selling album in history, only behind the band's previous release ''Vs.'', selling 877,000 copies in its first week and went multi-platinum quickly.<ref name=\"latimes12-15-1994\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-15/entertainment/ca-9311_1_pearl-jam |title=Vitalogy' Makes for a Real Pearl Jam of a Seller |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |last=Philips |first=Chuck |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |date=December 15, 1994}}</ref> The album has been certified [[RIAA certification|five times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States.

The band wrote many of the songs during soundchecks on its [[Vs. Tour]] and the majority of the album's tracks were recorded during breaks on the tour. The first session took place late in 1993 in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], where the band recorded \"[[Tremor Christ]]\" and \"[[Nothingman]]\".<ref name=\"musician\">Garbarini, Vic. \"Mother of Pearl\".

Producer [[Brendan O'Brien (record producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] said, \"''Vitalogy'' was a little strained. I'm being polite\u2014there was some imploding going on.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Bassist [[Jeff Ament]] said that \"communication was at an all-time low\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]] stated that the communication problems started once guitarist [[Stone Gossard]] stopped acting as the band's mediator.<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> According to Gossard, ''Vitalogy'' was the first album in which lead vocalist [[Eddie Vedder]] made the final decisions.<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> At the time, Gossard thought of quitting the band.<ref name=\"wayout\">Hilburn, Robert. \"Working Their Way Out of a Jam\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. December 22, 1996.</ref> Gossard said that the band was having trouble collaborating, so most of the songs were developed out of [[jam session]]s. He added that \"80 percent of the songs were written 20 minutes before they were recorded.\"<ref name=\"musician\"/> During the production of ''Vitalogy'', lead guitarist [[Mike McCready]] went into rehabilitation to receive treatment for alcohol and cocaine abuse.<ref name=\"guitar world\"/><ref name=\"tenpast\"/>\n\nDrums on \"Satan's Bed\" were performed by Abbruzzese's drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On the day it was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as \"Jimmy\".<ref>Reynolds, John, et al. [http://www.twofeetthick.com/2005/05/who-is-the-drummer-on-satans-bed/ \"Who is the drummer on \"Satan's Bed\"?\"]. TwoFeetThick.com. May 12, 2005.</ref> Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for ''Vitalogy'', Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with other band members.<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Gossard said, \"It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was up to me to say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason, his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> [[Jack Irons]], the original drummer for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on \"Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me\". Gossard said, \"Jack entered the band right at the end of making ''Vitalogy''. Jack's a breath of fresh air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He was just there to play drums and help out.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\n{{Listen\n |filename     = Better_Man.ogg\n |title        = \"Better Man\"\n |description  = A sample of \"Better Man\", from ''Vitalogy''. Considered a \"blatantly great pop song\" by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and rejected it from the band's previous album ''Vs.'' due to its accessibility.

The lyrics for the song have been claimed by some to be about Kurt Cobain; however, Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it is about \"the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train\".\n}}\nIn a 1995 interview, ''[[Guitar World]]'' writer Jeff Gilbert described ''Vitalogy'' as \"strange\" and \"very eclectic\". McCready agreed, saying, \"There is some weird stuff on there.\" McCready attributed the album's sound to the group recording it on tour.<ref name=\"guitar world\"/> During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said, \"''Vitalogy'' is the first one where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, 'This is so different. Is anyone going to like this?'...It had a more [[Punk rock|punk]] feel to it. Simple songs recorded really quickly.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Interview with Stone Gossard and Mike McCready\". ''[[Total Guitar]]''. November 2002.</ref> The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said, \"''Vitalogy'' is not really a 'solo' album. I don't think the songs demanded solos; it was more of a rhythmic album.\"<ref name=\"guitar world\"/>\n\n[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] said that \"thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, ''Vitalogy'' stands as Pearl Jam's most original and uncompromising album.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|title=''Vitalogy'' \u2013 Pearl Jam|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/vitalogy-mw0000121446|website=[[AllMusic]]|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|accessdate=March 21, 2009}}</ref> He added that \"in between the straight rock numbers and the searching slow songs, Pearl Jam contribute their strangest music\u2014the mantrafunk of 'Aye Davanita', the sub-Tom Waits accordion romp of 'Bugs', and the chilling sonic collage 'Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me'.\" \"Bugs\" features Vedder playing an accordion that he found at a thrift shop,<ref name=\"Marks\">Marks, Craig. \"Let's Get Lost\".

Vedder said, \"I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why I can write songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express.\"<ref name=\"Marks\"/> The lyrics of \"Not for You\" express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and \"how youth is being sold and exploited\",<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/> while Vedder said \"Corduroy\" is about \"one person's relationship with a million people.\"<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/> In \"Pry, To\" the phrase \"P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me\" is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of \"Immortality\" may be about [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it is about \"the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train.\"<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/> The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of \"Immortality\" were altered before the song was released as part of the album.

The three-CD Deluxe Edition features both the Legacy Versions of ''Vitalogy'' and ''Vs.'' with their bonus tracks and a copy of Live at the Orpheum Theater, Boston, April 12, 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pearljam.com/news/vs-and-vitalogy-20th-anniversary-editions|title=''Vs.'' and ''Vitalogy'' 20th Anniversary Editions|publisher=pearljam.com|accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Packaging==\nThe original title for the album was ''Life''. The first single, \"Spin the Black Circle\", was released before the album was released, and on the back of the single it states \"From the Epic album ''Life''\". The album title ''Vitalogy'' comes from an early 20th-century medical book on which the cover art and [[liner notes]] are based.<ref name=\"tenpast\">Weisbard, Eric, et al. \"Ten Past Ten\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. August 2001.</ref> ''Vitalogy'' literally means \"the study of life\".<ref name=\"rollingstone\"/>\n\nVedder found the medical book at a garage sale. Ament stated, \"Ed brought in that book, and we said man that would make a great album cover.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> He explained that from ''Vs.'' onward the band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records. Ament said, \"We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.<ref name=\"tenpast\" />\n\nThe booklet contains outdated discussions of health and well-being. Other notes in the booklet, dealing with life and death reflections, seem to be more personal, like a message typed on one of the last pages, supposedly referring to the loss of a loved one (\"I waited all day. You waited all day...but you left before sunset...and I just wanted to tell you the moment was beautiful. Just wanted to dance to bad music...drive bad cars...watch bad TV...should have stayed for the sunset... if not for me.\"). The booklet also displays some poems or original sayings not belonging to the songs' lyrics, but to be interpreted as a commentary to the songs and, again, as a reflection on how life should or should not be lived. An example is the poem typed on the \"Aye Davanita\" page. The song's subtitle is \"The song without words\", as it is an instrumental track. But the page displays a sort of poem about the wasted life of a young girl. Another episode of \"intruder words\" is on the \"Not for You\" lyrics page. After the second refrain, instead of the actual lyrics, the typed words give a hint about the [[Sisyphus]] myth (\"Yeah, you call me Sisyphus love. Yeah, I move the rock. I just don't want to talk about moving the rock. Anything that distracts me from moving the rock\"). The lyrics to \"Whipping\" are written on a copy of a petition to [[Bill Clinton]] against \"pro-life\" killings of [[abortion]] doctors. An X-ray of Vedder's teeth was pictured instead of lyrics on the page for \"Corduroy\".<ref name=\"Hilburn, Robert\"/>\n\n==Tour==\n{{Main|Vitalogy Tour}}\nPearl Jam promoted the album with tours in [[Asia]], [[Oceania]], and the [[United States]] in 1995.<ref>[http://pearljam.com/tour/shows.php Pearl Jam: Set Lists]. pearljam.com.</ref> The band was joined by new drummer [[Jack Irons]]. The short tour of the United States focused on the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]. The band continued its boycott against [[Ticketmaster]] during its tour of the United States, refusing to play in Ticketmaster's venue areas, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined it in refusing to play at Ticketmaster venues.<ref>DeRogatis, Jim. ''Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's''. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. {{ISBN|0-306-81271-1}}, pg. 64</ref> The band chose to use alternate ticketing companies for the shows.\n\nThe tour of the United States faced various troubles. Ament said that the band and its crew had to \"[build] shows from the ground up, a venue everywhere we went\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at [[San Francisco]], [[California]]'s [[Golden Gate Park]] in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering from the effects of [[Foodborne illness|food poisoning]]. Vedder left the hospital to play the show; however he was not able to finish and ended up performing just seven out of 21 songs with the band.<ref>[http://www.fivehorizons.com/tour/cc/t1995.shtml \"1995 Concert Chronology\"]. fivehorizons.com.</ref> [[Neil Young]] filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, \"That whole [Golden Gate Park] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I think the fact that Neil [Young] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs.\"<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States.<ref name=\"wayout\"/> Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, \"I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music.\"<ref name=\"spin\">Marks, Craig. \"The Road Less Traveled\". ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. February 1997.</ref> Ament later said, \"We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour.

Pictures]]. It was directed by [[Nicholas Stoller]] and [[Doug Sweetland]] (the latter in his [[list of directorial debuts|feature debut]]), written by Stoller and stars the voices of [[Andy Samberg]], [[Katie Crown]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Ty Burrell]], [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Jordan Peele]], [[Stephen Kramer Glickman]], and [[Danny Trejo]].\n\nThe film follows a hotshot package delivering [[stork]] (Junior) and his female human partner (Tulip), working at the distribution center of an enormous online store, Cornerstore.com, situated high in the mountains. After a boy sends a letter to the company, the two accidentally create a female baby using the defunct baby factory the storks had formerly used in their original business of making and delivering babies. In order to protect the baby from the company's manager and ensure Junior's promotion to succeed him, the two set off on a journey to deliver the baby to the boy's family.\n\n''Storks'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on September 17, 2016, and was released six days later in 3D, [[IMAX]] and conventional formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imax.com/movies/storks|title=Storks|publisher=[[IMAX]]|accessdate=19 October 2016}}</ref> The film received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised the animation, humor and voice acting, but criticism for the screenplay. It earned $183 million worldwide against a $70 million budget during its theatrical run.\n\n==Plot==\n\nFor generations, the storks of Stork Mountain delivered babies to families around the world, until one stork named Jasper attempted to keep an infant girl for himself. Jasper accidentally destroyed the infant's address beacon and went into exile. Unable to deliver the orphaned girl, the storks adopted her under the name Tulip. CEO stork Hunter discontinued baby delivery in favor of package delivery with Cornerstore.com.\n\nEighteen years later, Tulip, now a young adult, tries to promote new ideas for Cornerstore, which backfire and cause the company to lose stocks. Hunter declares her to be a severe burden and liability due to this incompetence (the charts also justify this, as every time she tries to help, their profits go way down, and when they ''do'' make progress, it is when she's absent). Hunter assigns top delivery stork Junior to fire Tulip so he may be promoted to boss. Junior cannot bring himself to do so and instead transfers Tulip to the mail room.\n\nMeanwhile, a young boy named Nate Gardner, who lives with his workaholic parents Henry and Sarah, is feeling lonely and wants a younger sibling. He sends a letter to Cornerstore and it reaches Tulip, who enters the defunct baby factory and inserts the letter into the baby-making machine, causing it to create a pink-haired infant girl. Junior injures his wing trying to shut down the machine. Afraid Hunter will fire him, Junior agrees to accompany Tulip and secretly deliver the baby to her family using a makeshift flying craft that Tulip invented. They eventually crash, escape a pack of [[Gray wolf|wolves]] that fall in love with the baby, and reach civilization, during which Junior and Tulip bond with the baby and name her Diamond Destiny. In the meantime, Henry and Sarah open up to Nate's desire for a younger sibling and spend time with their son by building a landing platform for the storks.\n\nJunior and Tulip encounter Jasper, who had followed them from Stork Mountain. Jasper has nearly repaired Tulip's delivery beacon, but is missing one piece, which had been in Tulip's possession for years. Junior confesses to Tulip that he was supposed to fire her, and a saddened Tulip leaves with Jasper to meet her family while Junior continues alone to deliver Diamond Destiny. Cornerstore's pigeon employee Toady learns about Diamond Destiny and informs Hunter, who reroutes her address beacon and leads Junior into a trap. Hunter fires Junior and has Diamond Destiny taken away to live with penguins until she is an adult in order to silence the incident and prevent more plummeting stocks.\n\nTulip reunites with Junior and they return to Stork Mountain during the highly anticipated Storkcon event to save Diamond Destiny from the penguins. When they are cornered in the baby factory by Hunter and the other stork employees, Junior sends millions of archived letters from families into the baby-making machine, causing it to rapidly produce babies and distract the storks. Hunter seizes control of a giant crane and tries to destroy the factory, only to have Diamond Destiny and abused birds help make the Cornerstore building collapse off Stork Mountain, causing Hunter, who is trapped inside the crane and unsuccessfully attempts to kill Junior and Tulip out of revenge, to fall to his death.\n\nIn the aftermath of Cornerstore.com's destruction, Junior rallies the storks to deliver all the babies to their families. Junior, Tulip, and Jasper deliver Diamond Destiny to the Gardners, and Junior has a vision of her future, taking her first steps, learning to ride a bike, being in a ballet, training her ninja skills, graduating and getting married. Nate is at first not happy about not getting a little brother but quickly cheers up upon seeing his new sister's ninja skills. Tulip finally meets her family, and Junior and Tulip continue working as co-bosses at Stork Mountain.\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Andy Samberg]] as Junior, a white stork working at Cornerstore as the company's top delivery stork, in hope of being promoted to becoming boss.<ref name=\"April2015TW\" /><ref name=\"EWMeetCast\" />\n*[[Katie Crown]] as Tulip, an 18-year-old orphan human worker at Cornerstore, who wishes to find her own family.<ref name=\"EWMeetCast\">{{cite news|last1=Gettell|first1=Oliver|title=Meet the cast and characters of 'Storks'|url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/storks-cast-characters|accessdate=August 15, 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 15, 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Kelsey Grammer]] as Hunter, a [[golf]]-obsessed and well-intentioned [[extremism|extremist]] [[white stork]] who is the executive [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Cornerstore and has a hatred of baby delivery.<ref name=\"EWMeetCast\" /><ref name=\"Dec2015CS\" /><ref name=\"ew.com\">{{cite news|last1=Gettell|first1=Oliver|title=Jennifer Aniston completes cast of animated movie Storks \u2014 exclusive|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/15/jennifer-aniston-storks-nicholas-stoller|accessdate=August 5, 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 15, 2016}}</ref> Years ago, he closed the baby production due to upgrading the company as a postal service.\n*[[Keegan-Michael Key]] as Alpha, a greedy-but caring [[wolf]] and the pack leader who wants to devour Junior and Tulip and adopt the baby.\n*[[Jordan Peele]] as Beta, Alpha's advisor.

Pictures]]. It was directed by [[Nicholas Stoller]] and [[Doug Sweetland]] (the latter in his [[list of directorial debuts|feature debut]]), written by Stoller and stars the voices of [[Andy Samberg]], [[Katie Crown]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Jennifer Aniston]], [[Ty Burrell]], [[Keegan-Michael Key]], [[Jordan Peele]], [[Stephen Kramer Glickman]], and [[Danny Trejo]].\n\nThe film follows a hotshot package delivering [[stork]] (Junior) and his female human partner (Tulip), working at the distribution center of an enormous online store, Cornerstore.com, situated high in the mountains. After a boy sends a letter to the company, the two accidentally create a female baby using the defunct baby factory the storks had formerly used in their original business of making and delivering babies. In order to protect the baby from the company's manager and ensure Junior's promotion to succeed him, the two set off on a journey to deliver the baby to the boy's family.\n\n''Storks'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on September 17, 2016, and was released six days later in 3D, [[IMAX]] and conventional formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imax.com/movies/storks|title=Storks|publisher=[[IMAX]]|accessdate=19 October 2016}}</ref> The film received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics, who praised the animation, humor and voice acting, but criticism for the screenplay. It earned $183 million worldwide against a $70 million budget during its theatrical run.\n\n==Plot==\n\nFor generations, the storks of Stork Mountain delivered babies to families around the world, until one stork named Jasper attempted to keep an infant girl for himself. Jasper accidentally destroyed the infant's address beacon and went into exile. Unable to deliver the orphaned girl, the storks adopted her under the name Tulip. CEO stork Hunter discontinued baby delivery in favor of package delivery with Cornerstore.com.\n\nEighteen years later, Tulip, now a young adult, tries to promote new ideas for Cornerstore, which backfire and cause the company to lose stocks. Hunter declares her to be a severe burden and liability due to this incompetence (the charts also justify this, as every time she tries to help, their profits go way down, and when they ''do'' make progress, it is when she's absent). Hunter assigns top delivery stork Junior to fire Tulip so he may be promoted to boss. Junior cannot bring himself to do so and instead transfers Tulip to the mail room.\n\nMeanwhile, a young boy named Nate Gardner, who lives with his workaholic parents Henry and Sarah, is feeling lonely and wants a younger sibling. He sends a letter to Cornerstore and it reaches Tulip, who enters the defunct baby factory and inserts the letter into the baby-making machine, causing it to create a pink-haired infant girl. Junior injures his wing trying to shut down the machine. Afraid Hunter will fire him, Junior agrees to accompany Tulip and secretly deliver the baby to her family using a makeshift flying craft that Tulip invented. They eventually crash, escape a pack of [[Gray wolf|wolves]] that fall in love with the baby, and reach civilization, during which Junior and Tulip bond with the baby and name her Diamond Destiny. In the meantime, Henry and Sarah open up to Nate's desire for a younger sibling and spend time with their son by building a landing platform for the storks.\n\nJunior and Tulip encounter Jasper, who had followed them from Stork Mountain. Jasper has nearly repaired Tulip's delivery beacon, but is missing one piece, which had been in Tulip's possession for years. Junior confesses to Tulip that he was supposed to fire her, and a saddened Tulip leaves with Jasper to meet her family while Junior continues alone to deliver Diamond Destiny. Cornerstore's pigeon employee Toady learns about Diamond Destiny and informs Hunter, who reroutes her address beacon and leads Junior into a trap. Hunter fires Junior and has Diamond Destiny taken away to live with penguins until she is an adult in order to silence the incident and prevent more plummeting stocks.\n\nTulip reunites with Junior and they return to Stork Mountain during the highly anticipated Storkcon event to save Diamond Destiny from the penguins. When they are cornered in the baby factory by Hunter and the other stork employees, Junior sends millions of archived letters from families into the baby-making machine, causing it to rapidly produce babies and distract the storks. Hunter seizes control of a giant crane and tries to destroy the factory, only to have Diamond Destiny and abused birds help make the Cornerstore building collapse off Stork Mountain, causing Hunter, who is trapped inside the crane and unsuccessfully attempts to kill Junior and Tulip, to fall to his death.\n\nIn the aftermath of Cornerstore.com's destruction, Junior rallies the storks to deliver all the babies to their families. Junior, Tulip, and Jasper deliver Diamond Destiny to the Gardners, and Junior has a vision of her future, taking her first steps, learning to ride a bike, being in a ballet, training her ninja skills, graduating and getting married. Nate is at first not happy about not getting a little brother but quickly cheers up upon seeing his new sister's ninja skills. Tulip finally meets her family, and Junior and Tulip continue working as co-bosses at Stork Mountain.\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Andy Samberg]] as Junior, a white stork working at Cornerstore as the company's top delivery stork, in hope of being promoted to becoming boss.<ref name=\"April2015TW\" /><ref name=\"EWMeetCast\" />\n*[[Katie Crown]] as Tulip, an 18-year-old orphan human worker at Cornerstore, who wishes to find her own family.<ref name=\"EWMeetCast\">{{cite news|last1=Gettell|first1=Oliver|title=Meet the cast and characters of 'Storks'|url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/storks-cast-characters|accessdate=August 15, 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 15, 2016}}</ref>\n*[[Kelsey Grammer]] as Hunter, a [[golf]]-obsessed and sadistic [[white stork]] who is the executive [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of Cornerstore and has a hatred of baby delivery.<ref name=\"EWMeetCast\" /><ref name=\"Dec2015CS\" /><ref name=\"ew.com\">{{cite news|last1=Gettell|first1=Oliver|title=Jennifer Aniston completes cast of animated movie Storks \u2014 exclusive|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/06/15/jennifer-aniston-storks-nicholas-stoller|accessdate=August 5, 2016|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 15, 2016}}</ref> Years ago, he closed the baby production due to upgrading the company as a postal service.\n*[[Keegan-Michael Key]] as Alpha, a greedy-but caring [[wolf]] and the pack leader who wants to devour Junior and Tulip and adopt the baby.\n*[[Jordan Peele]] as Beta, Alpha's advisor.
