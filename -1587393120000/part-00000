New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

Similar tests are used by the insurance industry to understand risks posed by infrequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe Trump administration simulated a series of pandemic outbreaks from China in 2019 and found that the U.S. government response was \"underfunded, underprepared, and uncoordinated\" (see [[Crimson Contagion]]).<ref name= simulation2019>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/trump-let-u-fall-behind-120054883.html|title=How Trump let the U.S. fall behind the curve on coronavirus threat|website=news.yahoo.com}}</ref> Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness.

A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

The symbol is a large key ring to which the Eurovision Song Contest Host Cities can attach their city key or other symbol representing the city.

The insignia is traditionally put on display in a public place, such as the City Hall or another venue of local significance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/about/in-depth/host-city-insignia-exchange/|title=Host City Insignia Exchange|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=19 March 2020}}</ref> Additionally, there is a fob with a picture of the [[Helsinki Senate Square]] attached to the key ring.\n\nThe idea of the rotating trophy was proposed jointly by the City of [[Helsinki]], the Finnish Broadcasting Company [[YLE]] and [[EBU]] in connection with the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest. Hand-engraved on the ring are the following texts: \"Eurovision Song Contest Host City\", all Host Cities up until the year 2006 and a stamp: Helsinki 2007 with the initials of the prize designers.

Each year, either five or six countries are exempt from the drawing for competing in the semi-finals: the big-five (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK), and the host country, if the host is not one of the big five. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]] the number of countries exempt was seven, as Australia joined the other six countries exempt because the country was considered a special guest contestant.\n\nRegardless if a country is exempt from competing in the semi-finals, all participating countries are allotted a semi-final in which to vote. \n \n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|- \n!

Hand-engraved on the ring are the following texts: \"Eurovision Song Contest Host City\", all Host Cities up until the year 2006 and a stamp: Helsinki 2007 with the initials of the prize designers.

Each year, either five or six countries are exempt from the drawing for competing in the semi-finals: the big-five (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK), and the host country, if the host is not one of the big five.

He and [[Jordan Peele]] were cast against each other, but both ended up being picked after demonstrating great comedic chemistry. Key played many characters on the show. One of his most famous characters is \"Coach Hines\", a high school sports coach who frequently disrupts and threatens students and faculty members. On the penultimate episode of ''Mad TV'', Hines revealed that he is the long-lost heir to the Heinz Ketchup company and only became a Catholic school coach to help delinquent teenagers like Yamanashi ([[Bobby Lee]]).

Key also portrayed various guests on ''Real **********ing Talk'' like the strong African Rollo Johnson and blind victim Stevie Wonder Washington. He often goes \"backstage\" as Eugene Struthers, an ecstatic water-or-flower delivery man who accosts celebrities. There is also \"Jovan Muskatelle\", a shirtless man with a jheri curl and a shower cap. He interrupts live news broadcasts by a reporter (always played by [[Ike Barinholtz]]), annoying him with rapid fire accounts of events that have happened frequently exclaiming \"It was crazy as hell!\" Celebrities that Key impersonated on the show include [[Ludacris]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Roscoe Orman]] (as his character [[Gordon (Sesame Street)|Gordon]] from ''[[Sesame Street]]''), [[Matthew Lillard]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Al Roker]], [[Terrell Owens]], [[Tyler Perry]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Eddie Murphy]] (as his character James \"Thunder\" Early from the movie ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''), [[Sherman Hemsley]] (as his character George Jefferson on ''[[The Jeffersons]]''), [[Charles Barkley]], [[Sendhil Ramamurthy]] (as [[Mohinder Suresh]]), [[Tyson Beckford]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] (originally played by Peele until Peele left the show at the end of season 13), [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Jack Haley]] (as the [[Tin Woodsman|Tin Man]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'').

He and [[Jordan Peele]] were cast against each other, but both ended up being picked after demonstrating great comedic chemistry. Key played many characters on the show. One of his most famous characters is \"Coach Hines\", a high school sports coach who frequently disrupts and threatens students and faculty members. On the penultimate episode of ''Mad TV'', Hines revealed that he is the long-lost heir to the Heinz Ketchup company and only became a Catholic school coach to help delinquent teenagers like Yamanashi ([[Bobby Lee]]).

Key also portrayed various guests on ''Real **********ing Talk'' like the strong African Rollo Johnson and blind victim Stevie Wonder Washington. He often goes \"backstage\" as Eugene Struthers, an ecstatic water-or-flower delivery man who accosts celebrities. There is also \"Jovan Muskatelle\", a shirtless man with a jheri curl and a shower cap. He interrupts live news broadcasts by a reporter (always played by [[Ike Barinholtz]]), annoying him with rapid fire accounts of events that have happened frequently exclaiming \"It was crazy as hell!\" Celebrities that Key impersonated on the show include [[Ludacris]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Roscoe Orman]] (as his character [[Gordon (Sesame Street)|Gordon]] from ''[[Sesame Street]]''), [[Matthew Lillard]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Al Roker]], [[Terrell Owens]], [[Tyler Perry]], [[Keith Richards]], [[Eddie Murphy]] (as his character James \"Thunder\" Early from the movie ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]''), [[Sherman Hemsley]] (as his character George Jefferson on ''[[The Jeffersons]]''), [[Charles Barkley]], [[Sendhil Ramamurthy]] (as [[Mohinder Suresh]]), [[Tyson Beckford]], [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] (originally played by Peele until Peele left the show at the end of season 13), [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Jack Haley]] (as the [[Tin Woodsman|Tin Man]] from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'').
