Its main characters are four [[plasticine]] [[List of fictional dogs|dogs]]: Rex, Wendy, Bad Bob and Vince.\n\nRex was first introduced as a minor character in ''Ident'' (1989), a short film directed by [[Richard Goleszowski]] for the ''[[Lip Synch (series)|Lip Synch]]'' series.<ref name=\"TelepathyRex\" /> During the seven years of development of the characters, Goleszowski produced three pilots, subtitled ''How Dinosaurs Became Extinct'' (1991), ''Dreams'' (1991) and ''North by North Pole'' (1996).<ref name=\"TelepathyRex\" /><ref name=\"BFIAardman\" /><ref name=AnnecyDinosaursDreams />\n\nThirteen ten-minute episodes of the series aired over two weeks on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] from December 1998.<ref name=\"BBCArchiveUpInSmoke\" /> A second thirteen episode series aired from September 2001 on the same channel. As well as the core cast guest voices included [[Paul Merton]], [[Morwenna Banks]], [[Judith Chalmers]], [[Antoine de Caunes]], [[Bob Holness]], [[Simon Day]], [[Bob Monkhouse]], [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]], [[June Whitfield]], [[Kathy Burke]], [[Pam Ayres]] and [[Eddie Izzard]].\n\nThe animation is unusual in that the models are almost two-dimensional and are animated to exaggerate this - they are flattened in appearance and animated on a sheet of glass with the backgrounds behind the sheet.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n\n* '''Rex''', the protagonist &mdash; a timid, irritable runt. He is quick-witted and usually comes up with plans to get out of the scrapes the gang finds themselves in. However, he can also annoy the others by being a smart aleck. His favourite superhero is Rocket Raymond.\n* '''Bad Bob''' is a \"big, fat slob\", interested in food and TV. His friends, and occasionally even he himself, describe him as a \"Big, fat, jelly-wobbly, fat bast-\", usually getting cut off towards the end. He is distinguishable by his eye patch, which changes from eye to eye, and often carries around a [[revolver]] almost the size of himself. However grumpy he might be, he is intelligent and loyal.\n* '''Wendy''' is the only female housemate, distinguishable by her eyelashes, pink colour, noticeably hemispheric breasts, and wears a pink bow on her head. She is cynical, sarcastic, and fiercely independent. Wendy provides solutions to problems albeit in a distant or non-caring way. She speaks in a Mancunian accent. \n* '''Vince''' is the pet of the household, although all four are dogs. He is distinguished by his prominent buckteeth and mismatched eyes. He speaks in single words or short disjointed phrases, his favourites being \"Spaghetti\", \"Tuesday\", \"Jam\", and \"Trousers\". Vince suffers from \"Random [[Luciano Pavarotti|Pavarotti]] Disease\", causing him to randomly blurt out snatches of opera. While he appears to be unintelligent, he occasionally shows great ingenuity, for example by building an elaborate [[Heath Robinson]] machine designed to kill a mouse. The other members of the gang often respond to Vince's random outbursts by irritably telling him to \"shut it\". Vince often has a habit of copying what others have said, sometimes even if they have just said it in their minds, which Bad Bob finds really annoying.\n\n===Other characters===\n\nMany one-off and recurring characters in Rex The Runt are voiced by various well-known UK celebrities. These include:\n\n* '''Doctor Dogg''' is a medical [[physician|doctor]]. Moustachioed, complacent and greedy, he's an opportunistic money-grabber, whose habitual charge for any treatment is \"ten [[Pound sterling|quid]]\" - regardless of whether the cure works or does more harm than good. He isn't above using the main characters in [[medical research]]. Voiced by [[Paul Merton]].\n* '''Arthur Dustcart''', another semi-regular character, who first makes an appearance in the last episode of the first series, but appears quite frequently in the second. He is an ugly but experienced [[dustman]], sporting sleepy mismatched eyes, a [[neckerchief]], a pair of dirty [[underpants]] and a large nose with prominent [[nasal hair]]. Despite his grotesque appearance and smell, he and Wendy get on rather well, much to the annoyance of Rex. He becomes a friend of the household when he helps find Rex after he was turned into spaghetti.\n* '''Mrs. Bloomers''', head of Kumfy Kennels. Treats dogs with care, until she put Vince in the kennel and he ate a chihuahua.\n* '''Judith Poodle''', hostess of a holiday program. Usually ends her sentences with \"Ruff!\"\n* '''Mr. Formal''', the Runts' bank manager, until Bad Bob brought his gun and made him think they were bank robbers.\n* '''Melting Blob Slime''', a three-year-old, but very smart slime creature who warned the Runts about the black hole.\n* '''Kylie Mandlebrotska''', Rex's old math teacher, until she fell into the black hole.\n* '''Easter Island Aliens''', three space aliens from the planet Thribb, where the people look like the [[Moai]] statues from Easter Island.\n* '''Mr Chittock''', angry neighbour to Rex, after the gang went into his house and drank his beer. Voiced by veteran alternative comedian [[Stephen Frost]].\n* '''Johnny Saveloy''', a teenage sausage who was really very old but was kept in a state of artificial youth due to the Church of Chemicology. Voiced by [[Bob Monkhouse]].\n* '''Stinky Basil''', a smarmy French talent-spotter. Voiced by [[Antoine De Caunes]], known best in the UK for presenting the [[Channel 4]] late-night adult entertainment show ''[[Eurotrash (TV series)|Eurotrash]]''.\n* '''The Happy Rabbits''', a band who may sing beautifully but are really cranky and will not let anybody stand in their way.\n\n==References to other Aardman productions==\nSeveral episodes of ''Rex the Runt'' contain inside references to other projects created by Aardman Animations:\n*In the episode \"Adventures on Telly Part I\", Wallace (from the ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' series) is washing the windows on Rex's house, until Bad Bob pushes his ladder over (in the film ''[[A Close Shave]]'', Wallace operates a window washing business).\n*[[Pib and Pog]], two of Aardman's lesser known creations, are present in the spectator gallery during the courtroom scene from \"The Trials of Wendy\" and are also present in the audience watching Rex's band in \"Stinky's Search for a Star\".\n*In the episode \"Johnny Saveloy's Undoing\", two of the jars containing the chemical essences of various stars are labelled \"[[Wallace and Gromit|Wallace]]\" and \"[[Wallace and Gromit|Gromit]]\". Another jar on the top shelf reads \"[[Nick Park]]\".\n*The exorcist called upon in \"Patio\" is actually [[Morph (character)|Morph]], a character from an Aardman children's show, wearing a trench coat, hat, and large moustache.\n*There are two references in the episode \"Wayne the Zebra\": A ''[[Chicken Run]]''-style chicken is rejected during the auditions (with Bad Bob making a comment regarding the recent popularity of chickens, referring to the film's success), and Bad Bob consults the Aardman book ''Cracking Animation'' ({{ISBN|0-500-28168-8}}, published in the US as ''Creating 3-D Animation'').\n*The episode entitled \"A Crap Day Out\" may be a pun on the Wallace and Gromit short film ''[[A Grand Day Out]]''.\n*Both Wallace from Wallace and Gromit and Rex live on streets that sound similar to their names: whereas Wallace and Gromit live on \"West Wallaby Street\", it can be seen from the various post that arrives for the household that Rex and company live at \"7, Marsupial Way, Rexford\"\n* In the 2006 film ''[[Flushed Away]]'': young rat named Maximillian \"Shocky\" Malone wears a green T-shirt with Rex on it.\n* in the 2015 film ''[[Shaun the Sheep Movie]]'': Vince is one of the photographed animals marked as 'contained' by Trumper.\n\n==Episode list==\n\n===Series 1 (1998 \u2013 1999)===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=99%\n|-\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"3%\" | #\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"24%\"| Title\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" | Summary\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"10%\" | Airdate\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 1 || ''Holiday in Vince'' || The Runts try to cure Vince of his Random Pavarotti Disease (a [[Tourette syndrome]]-like singing of phrases of [[opera]]) by miniaturising a submarine to go on a [[Fantastic Voyage|journey]] through Vince's brain.|| ''21 December 1998''\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2 || ''The Adventures on the Telly, Part I'' || After their television getting broken, the Telly Man wants them to cover for him while he is fixing the family's TV.

She speaks in a Mancunian accent. \n* '''Vince''' is the pet of the household, although all four are dogs. He is distinguished by his prominent buckteeth and mismatched eyes. He speaks in single words or short disjointed phrases, his favourites being \"Spaghetti\", \"Tuesday\", \"Jam\", and \"Trousers\". Vince suffers from \"Random [[Luciano Pavarotti|Pavarotti]] Disease\", causing him to randomly blurt out snatches of opera. While he appears to be unintelligent, he occasionally shows great ingenuity, for example by building an elaborate [[Heath Robinson]] machine designed to kill a mouse. The other members of the gang often respond to Vince's random outbursts by irritably telling him to \"shut it\". Vince often has a habit of copying what others have said, sometimes even if they have just said it in their minds, which Bad Bob finds really annoying.\n\n===Other characters===\n\nMany one-off and recurring characters in Rex The Runt are voiced by various well-known UK celebrities. These include:\n\n* '''Doctor Dogg''' is a medical [[physician|doctor]]. Moustachioed, complacent and greedy, he's an opportunistic money-grabber, whose habitual charge for any treatment is \"ten [[Pound sterling|quid]]\" - regardless of whether the cure works or does more harm than good. He isn't above using the main characters in [[medical research]]. Voiced by [[Paul Merton]].\n* '''Arthur Dustcart''', another semi-regular character, who first makes an appearance in the last episode of the first series, but appears quite frequently in the second. He is an ugly but experienced [[dustman]], sporting sleepy mismatched eyes, a [[neckerchief]], a pair of dirty [[underpants]] and a large nose with prominent [[nasal hair]]. Despite his grotesque appearance and smell, he and Wendy get on rather well, much to the annoyance of Rex. He becomes a friend of the household when he helps find Rex after he was turned into spaghetti.\n* '''Mrs. Bloomers''', head of Kumfy Kennels. Treats dogs with care, until she put Vince in the kennel and he ate a chihuahua.\n* '''Judith Poodle''', hostess of a holiday program. Usually ends her sentences with \"Ruff!\"\n* '''Mr. Formal''', the Runts' bank manager, until Bad Bob brought his gun and made him think they were bank robbers.\n* '''Melting Blob Slime''', a three-year-old, but very smart slime creature who warned the Runts about the black hole.\n* '''Kylie Mandlebrotska''', Rex's old math teacher, until she fell into the black hole.\n* '''Easter Island Aliens''', three space aliens from the planet Thribb, where the people look like the [[Moai]] statues from Easter Island.\n* '''Mr Chittock''', angry neighbour to Rex, after the gang went into his house and drank his beer. Voiced by veteran alternative comedian [[Stephen Frost]].\n* '''Johnny Saveloy''', a teenage sausage who was really very old but was kept in a state of artificial youth due to the Church of Chemicology. Voiced by [[Bob Monkhouse]].\n* '''Stinky Basil''', a smarmy French talent-spotter. Voiced by [[Antoine De Caunes]], known best in the UK for presenting the [[Channel 4]] late-night adult entertainment show ''[[Eurotrash (TV series)|Eurotrash]]''.\n* '''The Happy Rabbits''', a band who may sing beautifully but are really cranky and will not let anybody stand in their way.\n\n==References to other Aardman productions==\nSeveral episodes of ''Rex the Runt'' contain inside references to other projects created by Aardman Animations:\n*In the episode \"Adventures on Telly Part I\", Wallace (from the ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' series) is washing the windows on Rex's house, until Bad Bob pushes his ladder over (in the film ''[[A Close Shave]]'', Wallace operates a window washing business).\n*[[Pib and Pog]], two of Aardman's lesser known creations, are present in the spectator gallery during the courtroom scene from \"The Trials of Wendy\" and are also present in the audience watching Rex's band in \"Stinky's Search for a Star\".\n*In the episode \"Johnny Saveloy's Undoing\", two of the jars containing the chemical essences of various stars are labelled \"[[Wallace and Gromit|Wallace]]\" and \"[[Wallace and Gromit|Gromit]]\". Another jar on the top shelf reads \"[[Nick Park]]\".\n*The exorcist called upon in \"Patio\" is actually [[Morph (character)|Morph]], a character from an Aardman children's show, wearing a trench coat, hat, and large moustache.\n*There are two references in the episode \"Wayne the Zebra\": A ''[[Chicken Run]]''-style chicken is rejected during the auditions (with Bad Bob making a comment regarding the recent popularity of chickens, referring to the film's success), and Bad Bob consults the Aardman book ''Cracking Animation'' ({{ISBN|0-500-28168-8}}, published in the US as ''Creating 3-D Animation'').\n*The episode entitled \"A Crap Day Out\" may be a pun on the Wallace and Gromit short film ''[[A Grand Day Out]]''.\n*Both Wallace from Wallace and Gromit and Rex live on streets that sound similar to their names: whereas Wallace and Gromit live on \"West Wallaby Street\", it can be seen from the various post that arrives for the household that Rex and company live at \"7, Marsupial Way, Rexford\"\n* In the 2006 film ''[[Flushed Away]]'': young rat named Maximillian \"Shocky\" Malone wears a green T-shirt with Rex on it.\n* in the 2015 film ''[[Shaun the Sheep Movie]]'': Vince is one of the photographed animals marked as 'contained' by Trumper.\n\n==Episode list==\n\n===Series 1 (1998 \u2013 1999)===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=99%\n|-\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"3%\" | #\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"24%\"| Title\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" | Summary\n! style=\"background: #CCCCFF\" width=\"10%\" | Airdate\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 1 || ''Holiday in Vince'' || The Runts try to cure Vince of his Random Pavarotti Disease (a [[Tourette syndrome]]-like singing of phrases of [[opera]]) by miniaturising a submarine to go on a [[Fantastic Voyage|journey]] though Vince's brain.|| ''21 December 1998''\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| 2 || ''The Adventures on the Telly, Part I'' || After their television getting broken, the Telly Man wants them to cover for him while he is fixing the family's TV.

Its flavors are salty and sour, depending on the amount of salt put in and [[lactic acid]] resulting from [[fermentation]] process.\n\n== History ==\n''Pla ra'' is said to have probably originated in [[Mekong Basin]] with other [[fermented fish]] products. It might have originated by accident when a batch of old or improperly prepared salted fish was found acceptable. Freshwater fermented fish products are best developed in the area from the west of the [[Annamite Mountains]] to lower [[Myanmar]], where one of the main populations is Thai-Lao, who adopted the use of [[fermented fish]] from the south of the [[Yangtze River]] and developed it after they entered the [[Indochina|Indo-Chinese peninsula]].<ref name=five>{{cite book|last1=Prakash Tamang|first1=Jyoti|last2=Samuel|first2=Delwen|editor1-last=Prakash Tamang|editor1-first=Jyoti|editor2-last=Kailasapathy|editor2-first=Kasipathy|title=Fermented Foods and Beverages of the World|date=2010|publisher=CRC Press|location=London}}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\n''Pla ra'' is classified by its main ingredients. ''Pla ra'', which is fermented with roasted rice powder, will become yellow with a soft texture and distinctive smell. Mostly used as a paste, this type of ''pla ra'' is usually produced in [[central Thailand]]. This type of ''pla ra'' usually has [[Channa striata|striped snakehead fish]] or [[catfish]] as a main ingredient. The other type is ''pla ra'' fermented with rice bran. The product's color is clear black with a stronger smell. The fish is softer and smaller. It is mostly found in northeastern Thailand as an ingredient, or as a raw food.<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n''Pla ra'' which uses fresh fish is called ''pla ra sot''. Its flavors are salty with a little bit sour from [[lactic acid]]. ''Pla ra lom'' uses dead fish with has an [[Autolysis (biology)|autolysis reaction]] until it has an unpleasant smell, or uses fish which is soaked in water for 12\u201324 hours until it is softer.<ref name=\"three\" />\n\n== Process ==\nThere are differing methods to produce ''pla ra''. One method holds that there are two phases for making ''pla ra''. The first phase is to ferment fish with salt until it is softer, and the next phase is to ferment it with rice bran or roasted rice powder for its scent and flavor. A second approach is to ferment the fish with salt and coarsely pounded, toasted, raw glutinous rice for at least six months.<ref name=\"BP-20190609\"/> \n\nThe process starts with cutting the fish into small pieces and fermenting it with salt. After 24 hours, the fish is arranged in a container (mostly a pot) until it is tightly packed and filled with salt water afterwards. The container is sealed for three months. After three months, a first stage ''pla ra'' will be mixed with rice bran or roasted rice powder. Then, it will be rearranged in the container and sealed for two months or more.<ref name=\"three\" />\n\nIn 2018, the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (Thailand)|Thai Ministry of Agriculture]] published regulations to ensure the quality and hygiene of commercially-made ''pla ra''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Agriculture Ministry sets quality standard for 'pla ra' fermented fish|url=http://englishnews.thaipbs.or.th/agriculture-ministry-sets-quality-standard-pla-ra-fermented-fish/|accessdate=19 April 2018|work=Thai PBS|date=18 April 2018}}</ref><ref name=Nation-20180418/>\n\n== Dishes ==\n''Pla ra'' is usually eaten raw or as a chilli fish sauce. This dish is made of roasted [[Capsicum annuum|green pepper]], [[garlic]], [[shallot]]s, and boiled fish meat. All of these ingredients are ground together. Then boiled fermented fish liquid, [[fish sauce]], and [[lime juice]] are added to the mixture. It is used as a side dish for dipping vegetables or eaten with rice.<ref name=\"two\"/> ''Pla ra'' can also be processed into a powder by baking it with some spices until it is dry and the grinding it all together.<ref name=one>{{cite book|last1=\u0e0a\u0e21\u0e20\u0e39\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e0a\u0e23|first1=\u0e1e\u0e07\u0e29\u0e4c\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e19\u0e18\u0e38\u0e4c|title=\u0e23\u0e27\u0e22\u0e14\u0e49\u0e27\u0e22\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32|date=2003|publisher=Matichon|location=Bangkok, Thailand}}</ref> ''Nam prik pla ra'' and ''pla ra lon''<ref>{{cite web |title=Lon Pla Ra(Simmered preserved fish) |url=http://www.thaifolk.com/doc/cuisine/lonplara/lonplara_e.htm |website=Thaifolk.com |accessdate=9 June 2019}}</ref> are common in Thailand's [[Regions of Thailand|Central Region]]. \n\n== Nutrition ==\n'''Composition of ''pla ra''.'''<ref name=\"three\"/><ref name=four>{{cite book|last1=Boon-Long|first1=Phithakpol|editor1-last=Lee|editor1-first=Cherl-Ho|editor2-last=Steinkraus|editor2-first=Keith H.|editor3-last=Reilly|editor3-first=P.

Species of ''Staphylococcus'', ''Micrococcus'', and ''Bacillus'' act in [[protein degradation]].<ref name=\"three\"/>\n\n== Health issue ==\nWhen using ''pla ra'' as an ingredient for uncooked food, it is easily contaminated. An example is ''[[nam phrik]]'' (chilli fish sauce) which uses ''pla ra'' as an ingredient. ''Nam phrik'' is not cooked and is often kept for one or two meals. After a while, it will contain [[pathogens]] and have a high microorganism count. In some cases, nam phrik had both [[E. coli]] and [[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]] present, but no [[pathogen|pathogenic organisms]]. The reason is the acid from [[tamarind]] made the pH less than 4.6, which prevents the growth of most [[pathogens]]. ''Pla ra'' before reheating is contaminated with [[Staphylococcus aureus|S. aureus]] but the [[coliform]] is low and it is destroyed by cooking.<ref name=\"two\"/>\n\n==Other uses==\nIn a recent move by police and redevelopment workers to evict vendors from a market in the [[Khlong Toei District]] in [[Bangkok]], the local vendors barricaded themselves in the market.
