The grand prize remained 2 Crore Rupees. The third season of the show began airing on 22 January 2007.

Literally: ''No question is small''). The show moved from [[STAR Plus]] to [[Sony Entertainment Television India|Sony TV]]. The new logo designed for the fourth season incorporated the new [[Indian rupee symbol|Indian Rupee symbol]], which was unveiled earlier in the year.

This season introduced the \"Double Dip\" and \"Ask the Expert\" lifelines (similar to the United States counterpart from the Millionaire clock format).\n\n===Season 5: 2011===\n[[Amitabh Bachchan]] returned to host the fifth season which premiered on 15 August 2011 on the [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day of India]] and ended on 17 November 2011. It was again aired four days a week. Compared to the previous season, there was only one major gameplay change: there was only a single milestone (the Padao) that the contestant chose. The tagline used for the season was \"Koi Bhi Insaan Chota Nahi Hota\" (English: ''No human is small''. Literally: ''No person is inferior''). This season was the generally viewed as the most popular show on Indian television in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Television KBC 5 ends, leaves behind poignant memories|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Television/KBC-5-ends-leaves-behind-poignant-memories/Article1-770946.aspx|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=18 November 2011}}</ref>\nThis season introduced a play at home segment called \"[http://kbcgbjjtodayquestion.com/kbc-ghar-baithe-jeeto-jackpot-2018/ Ghar Baithe Jeeto Jackpot]\". This contest allowed home viewers to send an answer to a question via SMS during the show, with 1 Lakh Rupees going to the randomly picked winner, who can double or triple this amount by correctly answering further questions.\n\n===Season 6: 2012\u201313===\nThe registration (contestant tryout) for the season started from 28 May 2012. This sixth season (labeled as ''KBC 6'') was also hosted by Bachchan and premiered on 7 September 2012. It aired from Friday to Sunday evenings on [[Sony TV]]. The season ended on 26 January 2013. The tagline used for the season was \"Sirf Gyaan Hi Aapko Aapka Haq Dilata Hai\" (English: ''It is only knowledge that gives you your right''). This season retained the 13 question format of the previous season.\n\nThis season, ''KBC'' started a new tradition of giving an advantage to socially excluded people, known as \"Dusra Mauka\". Sonali Mukherjee, a victim of acid throwing, appeared along [[Lara Dutta]] in the first such special. On 13 January 2013, another special aired in which Manoj Kumar, a Mahadalit was accompanied by Indian actor [[Manoj Bajpayee]]. The winner of season 6 was Sunmeet Kaur.\n\n<ref>https://auditionsdekho.com/sony-tv-kaun-banega-crorepati/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goczAtbQhaI</ref>\n\n===Season 7: 2013===\nThe rehearsals for the show began on 26 June 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title='Kaun Banega Crorepati' rehearsals begin|url=http://badhil.com/kaun-banega-crorepati-rehearsals-begin/|publisher=Badhil}}</ref> Registration started from 8:30 PM on 27 May 2013.\n\nThe seventh season (called ''KBC 7'') was also hosted by Bachchan entitled \"Seekhna Bandh Toh Jeetna Bandh\" (English: ''If Learning stops, winning stops'' or simply: ''Learn to Win'') was used as the tagline for the season.  The total prize money was increased to {{INR}}7 Crore, and the number of questions increased from 13 to 15. The season was commenced on 6 September 2013.\n\nThe season had a few changes, including a new lifeline called Power Paplu. This lifeline allowed the contestant to reuse a lifeline that was previously used on another question. (It could not be a lifeline that was used on the current question. For example, a contestant could not use \"Ask the Audience\"/\"Audience Poll\" twice on the same question.) Double Dip and Ask The Expert were discontinued and in lieu 50:50 and Flip The Question (also known as \"Switch\" or \"Switch The Question\") were revived. The Phone-a-Friend was extended to 45 seconds. The prize for jackpot question was increased to {{INR}}7 Crore. The ''Kaun Banega Crorepati 2013'' set was a 360-degree multimedia stage. The final four questions were a part of ''Sapta Koti Sandook ''(English: ''The Seven Crore Jackpot)'' that let contestants win from {{INR}}1 Crore, {{INR}}3 Crore, {{INR}}5 Crore and finally {{INR}}7 Crore. The system of Fastest Finger First was also altered. Instead of playing one question, the winner of the leader board formed at the end of three questions, sits on the ''Hot Seat.'' (i.e. the player who answered the most questions correctly in the shortest amount of time).\n\n===Season 8: 2014===\nThe highest winning prize of this season was also {{INR}}7 Crore. The registrations of ''KBC 8'' were commenced on 22 July 2014 and the shooting started on 2 August 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kaun Banega Crorepati to shoot an episode in Surat!|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/television/tv-channels/gecs/kaun-banega-crorepati-to-shoot-an-episode-in-surat-140725|work=Indian Television|accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref> Shooting of the entire show was held in [[Surat]].

The Phone-a-Friend was shortened down to 30 seconds and the original Fastest Finger First system (as used for seasons 1 to 6) was reinstated.\n\nThe grand premiere episode of the series premiered on 17 August 2014 (Sunday) at 8:30 PM IST for 3 hours. The season aired from on Monday through Thursday evenings. Initially running for 1.5 hours, the program reduced to an hour. The season ended on 6 November 2014, and aired its two grand finale episodes on 9 November and on 16 November 2014. The tagline for the season was \"Yahan Sirf Paise Nahi, Dil Bhi Jeete Jate Hain\" (English: ''Not only money here, hearts are also won''). Three special guests appeared in the grand premiere episode: television comedian, [[Kapil Sharma (comedian)|Kapil Sharma]] from [[Colors (TV channel)|Colors TV]]'s television series ''[[Comedy Nights with Kapil]]'', [[Dayanand Shetty]] and [[Aditya Shrivastava]] from Sony TV's television series ''[[C.I.D. (Indian TV series)|CID]]'', and finally [[Rajput]] hero, Maharana Pratap a.k.a.

The tagline of this season was \"Jawaab dene ka Waqt aa gaya hai\" (English: ''The time has come to answer'').   The show aired from Monday to Friday at 9:00 pm. The season introduced a 16 question format, where the first 10 questions are timed (45 seconds for the first five questions and 60 seconds for the following five questions). The 50:50 lifeline replaced Double Dip and the Three Wise Men lifeline was replaced by the Plus One (from the United States version). Phone-a-Friend (now sponsored by [[Jio]]) introduced video calls. In case the contestant reaches the 16th question (Jio Jackpot Question), then the contestant cannot use the remaining lifelines. The last episode of the show was aired on 7 November 2017. Reportedly, with 19.8 million registrations, the show stood at the top of TRP ratings for the Indian television industry.\n\n===Season 10: 2018===\nThe show started registration on 6 June 2018 and started airing on [[Sony Entertainment Television|Sony TV]] from 3 September 2018. The tagline for the tenth season is ''Kab Tak Rokoge'' (English: ''How long will you stop'').<ref>[https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-10-whats-new-amitabh-bachchan-5336752/lite/ Kaun Banega Crorepati 10: What\u2019s new in the Amitabh Bachchan show]</ref> In this particular season, the Phone-a-friend lifeline was replaced with the Ask The Expert lifeline.\n\n===Season 11: 2019===\nKBC returned to air with Bachchan resuming hosting duties as it premiered on 19 August 2019 airing on Sony TV.<ref>\n{{url|https://www.bizasialive.com/sony-tv-begins-registration-process-for-kbc-11-launch/|KBC 11 registration begins}}</ref><ref>{{url|https://khabar.ndtv.com/news/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-11-new-promo-release-amitabh-bachchan-seen-with-new-style-and-new-moral-2067912|Kaun Banega Crorepati 11 new promo released with new style and new moral}} Retrieve on 11 July 2019</ref> In this season the show's tagline was '''Ade Raho''' (English- Keep Standing).

The show witnessed [[Sudha Murthy]] on their last episode of 'Karamveer Special' on 29 November 2019. The show was replaced by [[Beyhadh 2]] from 2 December 2019.\n\nUnfortunately, after season 8, nobody has won the Jackpot prize of Rs. 7 crore.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Qualification===\nSimilar to the original airing in Great Britain, members of the public completed a qualification quiz which opened at the start of each season at various times in the year (also known as \"registration period\"). Would-be contestants would sent a premium-rate SMS to a designated number and answer a question by responding. Contestants would complete a series of interviews before being randomly selected from a pool of other hopeful contestants and appearing on the stage in Fastest Finger First. In order to be eligible, contestants must be residents and citizens of India and at least 18 years of age.\n\n===Fastest Finger First===\nThe selected contestants are then brought to the studio to play Fastest Finger First where they will be asked to arrange four answers into the designated order in the shortest amount of time. In Season 7, contestants would play three questions and the one who answered the most correctly in the shortest amount of time will get selected to play the main game.\n\n===Main gameplay===\nAfter determining the winner of Fastest Finger First, they would join the host in the \"Hot Seat\" to start answering a series of multiple-choice questions on their way to win the top cash prize as outlined in the table below. Along the way, the contestant is free to walk away from the game with their winnings but if they got a question wrong, they would walk away with nothing unless they correctly answered a milestone question (highlighted in yellow) that would guarantee some winnings.\n\nTo help them along the way, much like its counterparts, the contestant had a set of lifelines available for them to use. Which lifelines were available were dependent on the format being used.\n* '''Audience Poll''' ('''Ask The Audience'''): The studio audience would dial into a keypad what they believed was the correct answer to the question. The results of the poll are shown to the contestant.\n* '''50:50''': The computer would remove two wrong answers from the game leaving the contestant one right and one wrong answer.\n* '''Phone-A-Friend''': The contestant could call a pre-selected friend or family member of their choosing to aid them in answering the question. Once connected, the aiding party and the contestant had 30 seconds (45 in Season 7) to talk it out among themselves. In 2017, this became a video call instead of a voice call. For season 10, this lifeline was removed in favor of reinstating Ask the Expert <ref>[https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-10-whats-new-amitabh-bachchan-5336752/lite/ Kaun Banega Crorepati 10: What\u2019s new in the Amitabh Bachchan show]</ref> The lifeline is called a phone a friend have next after 9 years. \n* '''Flip The Question''' ('''Switch The Question'''/'''Switch'''): The current question would be thrown-out and replaced with a new question. Any lifelines expended on the original question remained expended. It was introduced in the 2nd season, removed after the 3rd season and reinstated for the 7th & 11th season. During seasons 2 and 3 it could only be used after the 5th question, while it was available from the beginning in season 7. In season 11, new question would be of contestant's pre-selected category from given choice of 11 categories.\n* '''Double Dip''': As featured on the US \"Super Millionaire\", this granted the contestant two chances to answer the question. However, invoking this lifeline removed the ability to walk away from the question. The contestant must answer twice with no further usage of lifelines. (They may use other lifelines before invoking Double Dip but not during the resolution of the lifeline.) In the event of a clocked game, the timer would stop for the first guess only. After that, if the first guess was wrong, the timer resumed counting down. If the contestant did not make their second guess before the time limit or if it was wrong, the contestant would walk away from the game with the lower threshold amount, if any.\n* '''Expert Advice''' ('''Ask the Expert'''): In season 4, the \"Expert Advice\" lifeline was added to the pool of lifelines available. The producers would invite certain general knowledge expert to come to the studio to aid the contestant. This lifeline was restored for season 10 in 2018.<ref>[https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-10-whats-new-amitabh-bachchan-5336752/lite/ Kaun Banega Crorepati 10: What\u2019s new in the Amitabh Bachchan show]</ref> \n* '''Power Paplu''': Introduced in the 7th season, this lifeline allowed the contestant to reuse a lifeline that was previously used on another question. It could not be a lifeline that was used on the current question. \n* '''Triguni''' ('''\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0917\u0941\u0923\u0940,''' '''Three Wise Men'''):  Similar to its US counterpart, the producers would invite certain general knowledge experts or celebrities to come to the studio to aid the contestant. When invoked, the \"Three Wise Men\" were granted 30 seconds to discuss the question and the possible choices among themselves to come up with a consensus answer to relay back to the contestant who was often in earshot of the conversation. Once the time expired, the \"Three Wise Men\" were instructed to stop discussing the question and play resumed as normal.\n* '''Jodidaar''' ('''\u091c\u094b\u0921\u0940\u0926\u093e\u0930''', lit. '''Partner'''): Similar to the United States' '''Plus One''' lifeline, in addition to having 3 Phone-a-Friends, the contestant can also bring a designated family member or friend in to aid them in answering the question. (This person is designated by the contestant prior to the show.)\n\nAdditionally, starting in Season 4, the contestant would have to answer these questions within a certain amount of time. Contestants were allotted 30 seconds to respond up to and including the first threshold question (in 2017, this was increased to 45 seconds). The following question up to and including the next threshold contestants were allotted 60 seconds to give their \"final answer\". For the final set of questions (the question following the second threshold), questions were un-timed. Using a lifeline paused the timer temporarily until it resolved. If the contestant used Flip The Question, the timer would restart from the base value of the question.\n\nThe total number of questions available in the game changed. As the number of questions changed, so did the total prize money available. In 2017, KBC introduced a jackpot question. For the Jackpot Question, the contestants were not allowed to use any of the remaining lifelines.\n\nIn the fifth and sixth season, the contestants had to select a threshold or \"Padao\" themselves. They were allowed to choose any one question on the tree and designate that as a threshold amount. Meaning that if they cross the threshold, they were guaranteed that amount of cash winnings. Getting a question wrong before the Padao is reached would result in zero winnings.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px; cellpadding:2; cellspacing:0;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |Question number\n! colspan=\"7\" |Payout Structure\n|-\n!

The grand prize remained 2 Crore Rupees. The third season of the show began airing on 22 January 2007. The show started well but the show's ratings dropped significantly due to the change of the host.<ref>http://ibnlive.in.com/news/should-bollywoods-charmerinchief-stick-to-films-why-shah-rukh-khan-cant-crack-tv-game-shows/490232-8-66.html</ref> The season ended on 19 April 2007 with a special finale.\n\n===Season 4: 2010===\nThe fourth season (called ''KBC 4'') was hosted by the returning Amitabh Bachchan and started on 11 October 2010, on Bachchan's 68th birthday. This season was telecast four days a week, Monday through Thursday evenings. The tagline of the season was \"Koi Bhi Sawaal Chota Nahi Hota\" (English: ''Every question is important''. Literally: ''No question is small''). The show moved from [[STAR Plus]] to [[Sony Entertainment Television India|Sony TV]]. The new logo designed for the fourth season incorporated the new [[Indian rupee symbol|Indian Rupee symbol]], which was unveiled earlier in the year. The contestant tryout for the fourth season opened on 2 August 2010 at 9 PM [[Indian Standard Time|IST]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Amitabh Bachchan-hosted KBC 4 to go on air from Oct 1|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report_amitabh-bachchan-hosted-kbc-4-to-go-on-air-from-oct-11_1418189|work=DnaIndia|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref>  The total prize money for this season was {{INR}}1 Crore, and a jackpot question for {{INR}}5 Crore. The fourth season of the show was highly successful due to the return of former host Amitabh Bachchan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.oneindia.in/television/top-stories/news/2010/kbc4-beats-bigg-boss4-131210.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714010039/http://entertainment.oneindia.in/television/top-stories/news/2010/kbc4-beats-bigg-boss4-131210.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 July 2012 |title=KBC 4 beats Bigg Boss 4 in its final episode |work=One India |accessdate=13 December 2010 }}</ref> The season ended on 9 December 2010.\n\nDuring this season, much like its international counterparts, there were various rule changes made to the show. The number of questions were reduced from 15 to 13 and, as in the United States version of the show, a timer was added to each question.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/mam/headlines/y2k10/sep/sepmam82.php|title=KBC to give away Rs 50 MN in 60 minutes|work=Business Standard|access-date=28 September 2010}}</ref> There was a 30-second time limit for questions 1 and 2, and a 45-second time limit for questions 3 to 7. Questions 8 to 13 were not timed. Any time not used was voided and not banked (unlike the United States version which banked the time for the final question).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.india-server.com/news/kbc-4-will-be-presented-in-a-changed-30071.html |title=KBC 4 Will Be Presented in a Changed Format|work=India Server|access-date=14 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/kbc-waiting-forfacelift/402440/ |title=KBC: Waiting for a facelift |work=Business Standard |access-date=26 July 2010}}</ref> Much like other countries' version of the game, the clock stops whenever a lifeline is used and if the time limit expired, the contestant was forced to walk away with their current winnings. This season introduced the \"Double Dip\" and \"Ask the Expert\" lifelines (similar to the United States counterpart from the Millionaire clock format).\n\n===Season 5: 2011===\n[[Amitabh Bachchan]] returned to host the fifth season which premiered on 15 August 2011 on the [[Independence Day (India)|Independence Day of India]] and ended on 17 November 2011. It was again aired four days a week. Compared to the previous season, there was only one major gameplay change: there was only a single milestone (the Padao) that the contestant chose. The tagline used for the season was \"Koi Bhi Insaan Chota Nahi Hota\" (English: ''No human is small''. Literally: ''No person is inferior''). This season was the generally viewed as the most popular show on Indian television in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Television KBC 5 ends, leaves behind poignant memories|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Television/KBC-5-ends-leaves-behind-poignant-memories/Article1-770946.aspx|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=18 November 2011}}</ref>\nThis season introduced a play at home segment called \"[http://kbcgbjjtodayquestion.com/kbc-ghar-baithe-jeeto-jackpot-2018/ Ghar Baithe Jeeto Jackpot]\". This contest allowed home viewers to send an answer to a question via SMS during the show, with 1 Lakh Rupees going to the randomly picked winner, who can double or triple this amount by correctly answering further questions.\n\n===Season 6: 2012\u201313===\nThe registration (contestant tryout) for the season started from 28 May 2012. This sixth season (labeled as ''KBC 6'') was also hosted by Bachchan and premiered on 7 September 2012. It aired from Friday to Sunday evenings on [[Sony TV]]. The season ended on 26 January 2013. The tagline used for the season was \"Sirf Gyaan Hi Aapko Aapka Haq Dilata Hai\" (English: ''It is only knowledge that gives you your right''). This season retained the 13 question format of the previous season.\n\nThis season, ''KBC'' started a new tradition of giving an advantage to socially excluded people, known as \"Dusra Mauka\". Sonali Mukherjee, a victim of acid throwing, appeared along [[Lara Dutta]] in the first such special. On 13 January 2013, another special aired in which Manoj Kumar, a Mahadalit was accompanied by Indian actor [[Manoj Bajpayee]]. The winner of season 6 was Sunmeet Kaur.\n\n<ref>https://auditionsdekho.com/sony-tv-kaun-banega-crorepati/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goczAtbQhaI</ref>\n\n===Season 7: 2013===\nThe rehearsals for the show began on 26 June 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title='Kaun Banega Crorepati' rehearsals begin|url=http://badhil.com/kaun-banega-crorepati-rehearsals-begin/|publisher=Badhil}}</ref> Registration started from 8:30 PM on 27 May 2013.\n\nThe seventh season (called ''KBC 7'') was also hosted by Bachchan entitled \"Seekhna Bandh Toh Jeetna Bandh\" (English: ''If Learning stops, winning stops'' or simply: ''Learn to Win'') was used as the tagline for the season.  The total prize money was increased to {{INR}}7 Crore, and the number of questions increased from 13 to 15. The season was commenced on 6 September 2013.\n\nThe season had a few changes, including a new lifeline called Power Paplu. This lifeline allowed the contestant to reuse a lifeline that was previously used on another question. (It could not be a lifeline that was used on the current question. For example, a contestant could not use \"Ask the Audience\"/\"Audience Poll\" twice on the same question.) Double Dip and Ask The Expert were discontinued and in lieu 50:50 and Flip The Question (also known as \"Switch\" or \"Switch The Question\") were revived. The Phone-a-Friend was extended to 45 seconds. The prize for jackpot question was increased to {{INR}}7 Crore. The ''Kaun Banega Crorepati 2013'' set was a 360-degree multimedia stage. The final four questions were a part of ''Sapta Koti Sandook ''(English: ''The Seven Crore Jackpot)'' that let contestants win from {{INR}}1 Crore, {{INR}}3 Crore, {{INR}}5 Crore and finally {{INR}}7 Crore. The system of Fastest Finger First was also altered. Instead of playing one question, the winner of the leader board formed at the end of three questions, sits on the ''Hot Seat.'' (i.e. the player who answered the most questions correctly in the shortest amount of time).\n\n===Season 8: 2014===\nThe highest winning prize of this season was also {{INR}}7 Crore. The registrations of ''KBC 8'' were commenced on 22 July 2014 and the shooting started on 2 August 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kaun Banega Crorepati to shoot an episode in Surat!|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/television/tv-channels/gecs/kaun-banega-crorepati-to-shoot-an-episode-in-surat-140725|work=Indian Television|accessdate=25 July 2014}}</ref> Shooting of the entire show was held in [[Surat]].

The Phone-a-Friend was shortened down to 30 seconds and the original Fastest Finger First system (as used for seasons 1 to 6) was reinstated.\n\nThe grand premiere episode of the series premiered on 17 August 2014 (Sunday) at 8:30 PM IST for 3 hours. The season aired from on Monday through Thursday evenings. Initially running for 1.5 hours, the program reduced to an hour. The season ended on 6 November 2014, and aired its two grand finale episodes on 9 November and on 16 November 2014. The tagline for the season was \"Yahan Sirf Paise Nahi, Dil Bhi Jeete Jate Hain\" (English: ''Not only money here, hearts are also won''). Three special guests appeared in the grand premiere episode: television comedian, [[Kapil Sharma (comedian)|Kapil Sharma]] from [[Colors (TV channel)|Colors TV]]'s television series ''[[Comedy Nights with Kapil]]'', [[Dayanand Shetty]] and [[Aditya Shrivastava]] from Sony TV's television series ''[[C.I.D. (Indian TV series)|CID]]'', and finally [[Rajput]] hero, Maharana Pratap a.k.a. Faisal Khan from Sony TV's television series ''[[Bharat Ka Veer Putra \u2013 Maharana Pratap]]'' gave a stellar dance performance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bigger, better and deep-rooted \u2013 KBC Season 8!|url=http://www.adgully.com/bigger-better-and-deep-rooted-kbc-season-8-58545.html|accessdate=5 August 2014|work=Adgully}}</ref> Among others the [[Shillong Chamber Choir]] led by [[Neil Nongkynrih]] performed a medley of evergreen songs of Bollywood followed by a patriotic song at the opening ceremony of ''KBC8''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Shillong Chamber Choir performs at Kaun Banega Crorepati \u2013 season 8!|url=http://www.india-north-east.com/2014/09/Shillong-Chamber-Choir-performs-at-KBC-8.html|accessdate=2 September 2014|work=India-North-East.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905234406/http://www.india-north-east.com/2014/09/Shillong-Chamber-Choir-performs-at-KBC-8.html|archive-date=5 September 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Season 9: 2017===\nKBC returned to air with Bachchan resuming hosting duties as it premiered on 28 August 2017 airing on Sony TV. The tagline of this season was \"Jawaab dene ka Waqt aa gaya hai\" (English: ''The time has come to answer'').   The show aired from Monday to Friday at 9:00 pm. The season introduced a 16 question format, where the first 10 questions are timed (45 seconds for the first five questions and 60 seconds for the following five questions). The 50:50 lifeline replaced Double Dip and the Three Wise Men lifeline was replaced by the Plus One (from the United States version). Phone-a-Friend (now sponsored by [[Jio]]) introduced video calls. In case the contestant reaches the 16th question (Jio Jackpot Question), then the contestant cannot use the remaining lifelines. The last episode of the show was aired on 7 November 2017. Reportedly, with 19.8 million registrations, the show stood at the top of TRP ratings for the Indian television industry.\n\n===Season 10: 2018===\nThe show started registration on 6 June 2018 and started airing on [[Sony Entertainment Television|Sony TV]] from 3 September 2018. The tagline for the tenth season is ''Kab Tak Rokoge'' (English: ''How long will you stop'').<ref>[https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-10-whats-new-amitabh-bachchan-5336752/lite/ Kaun Banega Crorepati 10: What\u2019s new in the Amitabh Bachchan show]</ref> In this particular season, the Phone-a-friend lifeline was replaced with the Ask The Expert lifeline.\n\n===Season 11: 2019===\nKBC returned to air with Bachchan resuming hosting duties as it premiered on 19 August 2019 airing on Sony TV.<ref>\n{{url|https://www.bizasialive.com/sony-tv-begins-registration-process-for-kbc-11-launch/|KBC 11 registration begins}}</ref><ref>{{url|https://khabar.ndtv.com/news/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-11-new-promo-release-amitabh-bachchan-seen-with-new-style-and-new-moral-2067912|Kaun Banega Crorepati 11 new promo released with new style and new moral}} Retrieve on 11 July 2019</ref> In this season the show's tagline was '''Ade Raho''' (English- Keep Standing).

The show witnessed [[Sudha Murthy]] on their last episode of 'Karamveer Special' on 29 November 2019. The show was replaced by [[Beyhadh 2]] from 2 December 2019.\n\nUnfortunately, after season 8, nobody has won the Jackpot prize of Rs. 7 crore.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===Qualification===\nSimilar to the original airing in Great Britain, members of the public completed a qualification quiz which opened at the start of each season at various times in the year (also known as \"registration period\"). Would-be contestants would sent a premium-rate SMS to a designated number and answer a question by responding. Contestants would complete a series of interviews before being randomly selected from a pool of other hopeful contestants and appearing on the stage in Fastest Finger First. In order to be eligible, contestants must be residents and citizens of India and at least 18 years of age.\n\n===Fastest Finger First===\nThe selected contestants are then brought to the studio to play Fastest Finger First where they will be asked to arrange four answers into the designated order in the shortest amount of time. In Season 7, contestants would play three questions and the one who answered the most correctly in the shortest amount of time will get selected to play the main game.\n\n===Main gameplay===\nAfter determining the winner of Fastest Finger First, they would join the host in the \"Hot Seat\" to start answering a series of multiple-choice questions on their way to win the top cash prize as outlined in the table below. Along the way, the contestant is free to walk away from the game with their winnings but if they got a question wrong, they would walk away with nothing unless they correctly answered a milestone question (highlighted in yellow) that would guarantee some winnings.\n\nTo help them along the way, much like its counterparts, the contestant had a set of lifelines available for them to use. Which lifelines were available were dependent on the format being used.\n* '''Audience Poll''' ('''Ask The Audience'''): The studio audience would dial into a keypad what they believed was the correct answer to the question. The results of the poll are shown to the contestant.\n* '''50:50''': The computer would remove two wrong answers from the game leaving the contestant one right and one wrong answer.\n* '''Phone-A-Friend''': The contestant could call a pre-selected friend or family member of their choosing to aid them in answering the question. Once connected, the aiding party and the contestant had 30 seconds (45 in Season 7) to talk it out among themselves. In 2017, this became a video call instead of a voice call. For season 10, this lifeline was removed in favor of reinstating Ask the Expert <ref>[https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-10-whats-new-amitabh-bachchan-5336752/lite/ Kaun Banega Crorepati 10: What\u2019s new in the Amitabh Bachchan show]</ref> The lifeline is called a phone a friend have next after 9 years. \n* '''Flip The Question''' ('''Switch The Question'''/'''Switch'''): The current question would be thrown-out and replaced with a new question. Any lifelines expended on the original question remained expended. It was introduced in the 2nd season, removed after the 3rd season and reinstated for the 7th & 11th season. During seasons 2 and 3 it could only be used after the 5th question, while it was available from the beginning in season 7. In season 11, new question would be of contestant's pre-selected category from given choice of 11 categories.\n* '''Double Dip''': As featured on the US \"Super Millionaire\", this granted the contestant two chances to answer the question. However, invoking this lifeline removed the ability to walk away from the question. The contestant must answer twice with no further usage of lifelines. (They may use other lifelines before invoking Double Dip but not during the resolution of the lifeline.) In the event of a clocked game, the timer would stop for the first guess only. After that, if the first guess was wrong, the timer resumed counting down. If the contestant did not make their second guess before the time limit or if it was wrong, the contestant would walk away from the game with the lower threshold amount, if any.\n* '''Expert Advice''' ('''Ask the Expert'''): In season 4, the \"Expert Advice\" lifeline was added to the pool of lifelines available. The producers would invite certain general knowledge expert to come to the studio to aid the contestant. This lifeline was restored for season 10 in 2018.<ref>[https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/television/kaun-banega-crorepati-10-whats-new-amitabh-bachchan-5336752/lite/ Kaun Banega Crorepati 10: What\u2019s new in the Amitabh Bachchan show]</ref> \n* '''Power Paplu''': Introduced in the 7th season, this lifeline allowed the contestant to reuse a lifeline that was previously used on another question. It could not be a lifeline that was used on the current question. \n* '''Triguni''' ('''\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0917\u0941\u0923\u0940,''' '''Three Wise Men'''):  Similar to its US counterpart, the producers would invite certain general knowledge experts or celebrities to come to the studio to aid the contestant. When invoked, the \"Three Wise Men\" were granted 30 seconds to discuss the question and the possible choices among themselves to come up with a consensus answer to relay back to the contestant who was often in earshot of the conversation. Once the time expired, the \"Three Wise Men\" were instructed to stop discussing the question and play resumed as normal.\n* '''Jodidaar''' ('''\u091c\u094b\u0921\u0940\u0926\u093e\u0930''', lit. '''Partner'''): Similar to the United States' '''Plus One''' lifeline, in addition to having 3 Phone-a-Friends, the contestant can also bring a designated family member or friend in to aid them in answering the question. (This person is designated by the contestant prior to the show.)\n\nAdditionally, starting in Season 4, the contestant would have to answer these questions within a certain amount of time. Contestants were allotted 30 seconds to respond up to and including the first threshold question (in 2017, this was increased to 45 seconds). The following question up to and including the next threshold contestants were allotted 60 seconds to give their \"final answer\". For the final set of questions (the question following the second threshold), questions were un-timed. Using a lifeline paused the timer temporarily until it resolved. If the contestant used Flip The Question, the timer would restart from the base value of the question.\n\nThe total number of questions available in the game changed. As the number of questions changed, so did the total prize money available. In 2017, KBC introduced a jackpot question. For the Jackpot Question, the contestants were not allowed to use any of the remaining lifelines.\n\nIn the fifth and sixth season, the contestants had to select a threshold or \"Padao\" themselves. They were allowed to choose any one question on the tree and designate that as a threshold amount. Meaning that if they cross the threshold, they were guaranteed that amount of cash winnings. Getting a question wrong before the Padao is reached would result in zero winnings.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"center\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px; cellpadding:2; cellspacing:0;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 |Question number\n! colspan=\"7\" |Payout Structure\n|-\n!

The term lexical entries come from the idea of the \"mental lexicon\", which specifies what speakers know about individual lexical items. Each lexical item (LI) is associated with a lexical entry, minimally a triplet of features: Phonological, Formal, and Semantic. Phonological features indicate whether the LI is free or bound. Formal features indicated syntactic category labels. Finally, semantic features indicate... In accordance with X-Bar Theory and the Projection Principle, all of these features must be satisfied in order to create a well formed sentence. Below is an example sentence, \"The adults asked if the cats would pee on the sofa\", with a chart illustrating lexical entries for each word:\n''The adults asked if the cats would pee on the sofa''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !!

Verbs that take just one argument are classified as intransitive, while verbs with two and three arguments are classified as transitive and ditransitive, respectively.<ref>See Tallerman (2011:39-41) for a discussion of subcategorization in terms of intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs.</ref> The following sentences are employed to illustrate the concept of subcategorization:\n\n::Luke worked.\n::Indiana Jones ate chilled monkey brain.\n::Tom waited for us.\n\nThe verb ''worked/work'' is intransitive and thus subcategorizes for a single argument (here ''Luke''), which is the subject; therefore its subcategorization frame contains just a subject argument. The verb ''ate/eat'' is transitive, so it subcategorizes for two arguments (here ''Indiana Jones'' and ''chilled monkey brain''), a subject and an optional object, which means that its subcategorization frame contains two arguments. And the verb ''waited/wait'' subcategorizes for two arguments as well, although the second of these is an optional prepositional argument associated with the preposition ''for''. In this regard, we see that the subcategorization frame of verbs can contain specific words. Subcategorization frames are sometimes schematized in the following manner:\n\n::work [NP __ ]\n::eat [NP __ (NP)]\n::wait [NP __ (''for'' NP)]\n\nThese examples demonstrate that subcategorization frames are specifications of the number and types of arguments of a word (usually a verb), and they are believed to be listed as [[lexicon|lexical]] information (that is, they are thought of as part of a speaker's knowledge of the word in the vocabulary of the language). Dozens of distinct subcategorization frames are needed to accommodate the full combinatory potential of the verbs of any given language. Finally, subcategorization frames are associated most closely with verbs, although the concept can also be applied to other word categories.\n\nSubcategorization frames are essential parts of a number of [[phrase structure grammar]]s, e.g. [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], and [[Minimalism (linguistics)|Minimalism]].\n\n==Occurrences==\nSubcategorization can be observed in any language, including but not limited to:\nFrench\nGerman\nMandarin \n==Valency==\nThe subcategorization notion is similar to the notion of [[valency (linguistics)|valency]], although subcategorization originates with [[phrase structure grammar]]s in the [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] tradition,<ref>See Chomsky (1965).</ref> whereas valency originates with [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] of the [[dependency grammar]] tradition.<ref>See Tesni\u00e8re (1959).</ref> The primary difference between the two concepts concerns the status of the subject.

For example:\n\n* \"And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and [[Noah]] only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.\" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 7:22\u201324)\n* \"Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcass of an unclean beast, or a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.\" ([[Leviticus]] 5:2)\n* \"And Joshua, and all of Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had.\" ([[Joshua]] 7.24)\n\n== In Shakespeare ==\n[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] is known for using various rhetorical devices in his works, including polysyndeton.\n* \"When thou dost ask me blessing I'll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live and pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh at gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues talk of court news, and we'll talk with them too\" (''[[King Lear]]'' 5.3.11\u20135)\n* \"Why, this is not a boon! 'Tis as I should entreat you to wear your gloves, or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, or sue you to do a peculiar profit to your person\" (''[[Othello]]'' 3.3.85\u20139)\n* \"If there be cords, or knives, or poison, or fire, or suffocating streams, I'll not endure it\" (''[[Othello]]'' 3.3.443\u20135)\n* \"Though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare\" (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' 2.5.42\u20135)\n* \"Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous-where is your mother?\" (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' 2.5.59\u201361)\n\n==Modern usage==\nWriters of modern times have also used the scheme:\n\n* \"There were frowzy fields, and cow-houses, and dunghills, and dustheaps, and ditches, and gardens, and summer-houses, and carpet-beating grounds, at the very door of the Railway.

[...] The first night he built his fire and was sitting by it with his shotgun leaning against a tree and was sipping coffee from a canteen cup [...] (''[[The Orchard Keeper]]'', 1965)\n* Now the entire herd had begun to wheel wider and faster along the bluff and the outermost ranks swung centrifugally over the escarpment row on row wailing and squealing and above this the howls and curses of the drovers that now up-reared in the moil of flesh they tended and swept with dust had begun to assume satanic looks with their staves and wild eyes as if they were no true swineherds but disciples of darkness got among these charges to herd them to their doom.

[...] Kirby turned his head to one side and gripped his nose between his thumb and forefinger and sneezed a gout of yellow snot into the grass and wiped his fingers on the knee of his jeans. (''[[Child of God]]'', 1973)\n* Suttree looked at the ground and smiled and wiped his mouth with the back of his wrist and looked up again. [...] The skiff bobbed and slid heavily and the bilgewater surged. [...] Suttree stretched and rubbed his back and eyed the sun. It was already very hot. He went along the deck and pushed open the door and entered.

[...] The judge wrote on and then he folded the ledger shut and laid it to one side and pressed his hands together and passed them down over his nose and mouth and placed them palm down on his knees.

He wafts his hat and the lunar dome of his skull passes palely under the lamps and he swings about and takes possession of one of the fiddles and he pirouettes and makes a pass, two passes, dancing and fiddling at once. (''[[Blood Meridian]]'', 1985)\n* The mouths of the cans were lensed with tinted cellophane and they cast upon the sheeting a shadowplay in the lights and smoke of antic demon players and a pair of goshawks arched chittering through the partial darkness overhead.

(''[[The Crossing (McCarthy novel)|The Crossing]]'', 1994)\n* They stood in the doorway and stomped the rain from their boots and swung their hats and wiped the water from their faces.

And God made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps upon the earth to its kind. And God saw that it was good.''<ref>Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 52</ref>}}\n\nAuthor [[Ernest Hemingway]] employs the conjunction \"and\" to convey \"a flow and continuity of experience\" in a passage from his short story \"[[Winner Take Nothing |After the Storm]]\": \n{{quote| ''\"I said, 'Who killed him?' and he said 'I don't know who killed him, but he's dead all right,' and it was dark and there was water standing in the street and no lights or windows broke and boats all up in the town and trees blown down and everything all blown and I got a skiff and went out and found my boat where I had her inside Mango Key and she was right only she was full of water.\"''<ref>Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 52</ref>}}\n\nThe poet [[John Keats |Keats]] used conjunctions in a verse from [[Endymion (poem)| Endymion]]:  \n{{quote| ''And soon it lightly dipped, and rose, and sank,\n''And dipped again...''<ref>Baldick, 2008. P. 264</ref>}}\n\n==In the King James Bible==\nPolysyndeton is used extensively in the [[King James Version of the Bible]], where ''and'' is used as a literal translation of the Hebrew [[waw-consecutive]] and the Ancient Greek particle [[wikt:\u03b4\u03ad|\u03b4\u03ad]]. For example:\n\n* \"And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and [[Noah]] only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.\" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 7:22\u201324)\n* \"Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcass of an unclean beast, or a carcass of unclean cattle, or the carcass of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.\" ([[Leviticus]] 5:2)\n* \"And Joshua, and all of Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had.\" ([[Joshua]] 7.24)\n\n== In Shakespeare ==\n[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] is known for using various rhetorical devices in his works, including polysyndeton.\n* \"When thou dost ask me blessing I'll kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live and pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh at gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues talk of court news, and we'll talk with them too\" (''[[King Lear]]'' 5.3.11\u20135)\n* \"Why, this is not a boon! 'Tis as I should entreat you to wear your gloves, or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, or sue you to do a peculiar profit to your person\" (''[[Othello]]'' 3.3.85\u20139)\n* \"If there be cords, or knives, or poison, or fire, or suffocating streams, I'll not endure it\" (''[[Othello]]'' 3.3.443\u20135)\n* \"Though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's, and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare\" (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' 2.5.42\u20135)\n* \"Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous-where is your mother?\" (''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' 2.5.59\u201361)\n\n==Modern usage==\nWriters of modern times have also used the scheme:\n\n* \"There were frowzy fields, and cow-houses, and dunghills, and dustheaps, and ditches, and gardens, and summer-houses, and carpet-beating grounds, at the very door of the Railway.

[...] The first night he built his fire and was sitting by it with his shotgun leaning against a tree and was sipping coffee from a canteen cup [...] (''[[The Orchard Keeper]]'', 1965)\n* Now the entire herd had begun to wheel wider and faster along the bluff and the outermost ranks swung centrifugally over the escarpment row on row wailing and squealing and above this the howls and curses of the drovers that now up-reared in the moil of flesh they tended and swept with dust had begun to assume satanic looks with their staves and wild eyes as if they were no true swineherds but disciples of darkness got among these charges to herd them to their doom. [...] The hogs boiled past squealing and plunging and the chalky red smoke of their passage hung over the river and stained the sky with something of sunset.

[...] Kirby turned his head to one side and gripped his nose between his thumb and forefinger and sneezed a gout of yellow snot into the grass and wiped his fingers on the knee of his jeans. (''[[Child of God]]'', 1973)\n* Suttree looked at the ground and smiled and wiped his mouth with the back of his wrist and looked up again. [...] The skiff bobbed and slid heavily and the bilgewater surged. [...] Suttree stretched and rubbed his back and eyed the sun. It was already very hot. He went along the deck and pushed open the door and entered. (''[[Suttree]]'', 1979)\n* The horse screamed and reared and the Apache struggled to keep his seat and drew his sword and found himself staring into the black lemniscate that was the paired bores of Glanton's double<!--\"doublerifle\", sic-->rifle. [...] Dust stanched the wet and naked heads of the scalped who with the fringe of hair below their wounds and tonsured to the bone now lay like maimed and naked monks in the bloodslaked dust and everywhere the dying groaned and gibbered and the horses lay screaming. [...] The judge wrote on and then he folded the ledger shut and laid it to one side and pressed his hands together and passed them down over his nose and mouth and placed them palm down on his knees. [...] He bows to the fiddlers and sashays backwards and throws back his head and laughs deep in his throat and he is a great favorite, the judge. He wafts his hat and the lunar dome of his skull passes palely under the lamps and he swings about and takes possession of one of the fiddles and he pirouettes and makes a pass, two passes, dancing and fiddling at once. (''[[Blood Meridian]]'', 1985)\n* The mouths of the cans were lensed with tinted cellophane and they cast upon the sheeting a shadowplay in the lights and smoke of antic demon players and a pair of goshawks arched chittering through the partial darkness overhead.

(''[[The Crossing (McCarthy novel)|The Crossing]]'', 1994)\n* They stood in the doorway and stomped the rain from their boots and swung their hats and wiped the water from their faces.

This road was superseded in 1824 by what was known as the Bathurst Road (now Old Bathurst Road). It avoided watercourses, but its grade was very steep and this rendered it hazardous to travellers. When [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Major Thomas Mitchell]] was appointed as [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] in 1828, one of the first matters to which he turned his attention was the improvement of the Great Western Road. Mitchell's attention was focussed on providing a more direct and easily graded route for the Great Western Road. Mitchell surveyed and recommended the construction of a road along this route midway between the other two in preference to the Governor's suggestion of stationing a permanent repair gang on the Old Bathurst Road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/mitchells-pass.html |title=Mitchell's Pass, Lapstone |work=Australia For Everyone |publisher= |date=2019 |access-date=3 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929221524/http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/mitchells-pass.html |archive-date=29 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\n{{blockquote|'Mr David Lennox, who left his stone wall at my request, and with his sleeves still tucked up, came with me to my office, and undertook to plan the stone bridges required, make the centring arches and to carry on such works by directing and instructing the common labourers then at the disposal of the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]].'|[[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]], Letter to Perry, 22 March 1833.<ref name=nswshr-24-244>{{cite book|author=Mitchell, Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Mitchell (explorer) |title=Letter to Perry |date=22 March 1833 }}</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>}}\n\nAnd on 1 October 1832, only seven weeks after his arrival in the colony, Lennox was appointed (subject to London's confirmation) Sub-Inspector of Bridges in New South Wales.

The bridge remained very robust and carried increasingly heavy traffic as the Great Road to the west became busier. The success of the railway after 1867 diverted much transport business away from the road until the twentieth century and advent of the motor vehicle. Mitchell's Pass began to bear more traffic than was comfortable for Lenox Bridge, although the conversion of [[Knapsack Viaduct]] from a trail line to a road bridge in 1926 opened a new road route up the Monocline and at last diverted much of the traffic from Mitchell's Pass.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\nMitchell's Pass continued to be used, however, and by 1975 it was plain that substantial works were necessary to secure the safety of Lennox Bridge.

The [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] are on bedrock, with the water running through a channel cut by Lennox's convicts in the bed of the creek. The bridge is quite small, with a span of only {{convert|20|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. The single arch is built of [[ashlar]]ed stone blocks mortared together. The arch on the south side has a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] bearing the inscription \"DAVID LENNOX\", on the north side, \"AD 1833\", the packing of the bridge to either hand of the main ashlared section is of coursed rubble [[revetment]]s, making the total length of the bridge carriageway of almost {{convert|47|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. The stone [[parapet]]s are laid above a projecting [[plinth]] which begins just above the keystones. The area between the curve of the arch and the horizontal carriageway was packed with small rubble stone.<ref name=CMP/>\n\nThere was originally a damp-proof lime-mortar course above the vaulting, but this, together with most of the packing, was removed when the bridge was stripped back to the arch in 1976. During these repairs new concrete supports were inserted to bear the weight of a new carriageway utilising steel girders to take the traffic then still using Mitchell's Pass. These changes arc not visible, but the insertion of new blocks of stone and repairs to existing blocks on the main arch are legible. The original stone-cut channel for the creek still exists but is obscured by a concrete channel poured within Lennox's work during the 1976 repairs. Since Mitchell's Pass ceased to take the heavy traffic over the Blue Mountains, via the former Knapsack Railway Viaduct, the road is now one-way only downhill from Lennox Bridge and the traffic is largely for tourist purposes. There is a small amount of car-parking space beside the bridge and a concrete stairwell and path down to the creek on the west side. The visitor can safely walk under the bridge obtain the most attractive views.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 28 November 2013, the physical condition was good.<ref name=nswshr-24/> The bridge retains a high degree of original fabric. 1976 restorations do not detract from the significance of the built heritage item.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe road was closed, the carriageway removed and the bridge stripped down to its bare stone arch in 1976. The Department of Main Roads decided that the stress had to be removed from the original arch and reconstructed the carriageway so that it was supported on two new concrete walls and borne on horizontal steel girders. With other repairs to the stonework and to the channel for the creek under the bridge, the road was reopened in 1976 with the new work largely concealed from view. With much reduced traffic flow and the road to the plains from the bridge made one-way only (downhill), the Lennox Bridge continues to serve as the oldest stone bridge on the Australian Mainland.<ref name=nswshr-24-246>Kullas, LGEA of NSW Journal, July 1983, 85- 86</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 28 November 2013, Lennox Bridge was the oldest stone bridge on the Australian mainland.

At forty-five years of age Lennox began service under Major Mitchell. Prior to arriving in the Colony he had spent seventeen years on public works executed at the expense of the British Government. During this time he constructed a number of wooden bridges associated with the Gloucester-Berkeley Canal and a stone bridge near [[Gloucester, New South Wales|Gloucester]]. In 1832, two years after the death of his wife, Lennox arrived on the Colony on the ''[[Florentia (1821 ship)|Florentia]]''. Not long after his arrival, he was discovered by Major Mitchell. On 1 October 1832, following the review of his credentials, Lennox was appointed to the Roads Department as the Sub-Inspector of Bridges. Within six weeks of his appointment Lennox and his men had cut most of the stone and procured lime for mortar. By July 1833, the bridge was complete. The success of Lennox's design is demonstrated through its on-going stability and continued use. Major restoration and safety improvement work was not required until the 1950s.\n\nLennox Bridge is also associated with at least twenty convicts, an overseer, a constable and an armed sentry that worked on the site between October 1832 and July 1833, the construction gang worked from 7am to 4pm, when they returned to their stockade at [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]]. The work involved stone cutting and setting, carpentry and masonry required to construct the bridge. Following completion of the bridge Lennox requested to retain the: services of eight convicts: William Brady, John Carsons, Robert Hyams, John Johnson, Patrick Malowney (Maloney), Thomas Nelson, James Randall and Daniel Williams. The sentences of six of the eight convicts were remitted. The remaining two were reduced after a further six months of work.<ref name=nswshr-24-247>Low, 1983, p12</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe original bridge, on a horse-shoe curve, was daring, experimental and remarkably attractive, The stonework has been restored some infelicities have been allowed on the revetment and the changes made in 1976 by introducing concrete to the stone-cut water channel beneath the bridge are unpleasing but David Lennox's concept for the bridge of a very pretty small gorge remains aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge was carried on a single semi-circular stone arch of ten feet radius. The roadway was thirty feet wide at the crown of the arch and the same height above the bed or the gully. After bearing over one hundred and seventy years of traffic and one major restoration still stands stable. The bridge is a very fine example of the work of David Lennox and represents the first scientifically constructed stone arched bridge of its magnitude In Australia.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nLennox Bridge is exceptionally rare. No other bridges of similar age or design have survived on the Australian mainland.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nLennox Bridge is the oldest scientifically constructed stone arch bridge on the Australian mainland.

This road was superseded in 1824 by what was known as the Bathurst Road (now Old Bathurst Road). It avoided watercourses, but its grade was very steep and this rendered it hazardous to travellers. When [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Major Thomas Mitchell]] was appointed as [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] in 1828, one of the first matters to which he turned his attention was the improvement of the Great Western Road. Mitchell's attention was focussed on providing a more direct and easily graded route for the Great Western Road. Mitchell surveyed and recommended the construction of a road along this route midway between the other two in preference to the Governor's suggestion of stationing a permanent repair gang on the Old Bathurst Road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/mitchells-pass.html |title=Mitchell's Pass, Lapstone |work=Australia For Everyone |publisher= |date=2019 |access-date=3 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190929221524/http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/mitchells-pass.html |archive-date=29 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\n{{blockquote|'Mr David Lennox, who left his stone wall at my request, and with his sleeves still tucked up, came with me to my office, and undertook to plan the stone bridges required, make the centring arches and to carry on such works by directing and instructing the common labourers then at the disposal of the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]].'|[[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]], Letter to Perry, 22 March 1833.<ref name=nswshr-24-244>{{cite book|author=Mitchell, Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Mitchell (explorer) |title=Letter to Perry |date=22 March 1833 }}</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>}}\n\nAnd on 1 October 1832, only seven weeks after his arrival in the colony, Lennox was appointed (subject to London's confirmation) Sub-Inspector of Bridges in New South Wales.

Mitchell's Pass began to bear more traffic than was comfortable for Lenox Bridge, although the conversion of [[Knapsack Viaduct]] from a trail line to a road bridge in 1926 opened a new road route up the Monocline and at last diverted much of the traffic from Mitchell's Pass.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\nMitchell's Pass continued to be used, however, and by 1975 it was plain that substantial works were necessary to secure the safety of Lennox Bridge. Restoration works took place in 1976.<ref name=nswshr-24/> The bridge served the main route to the Blue Mountains for 93 years until 1926, when the [[Great Western Highway]] was re-routed via the Knapsack Viaduct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infobluemountains.net.au/history/lennox.htm|title=Lennox Bridge, Mitchell's Pass, Lapstone Hill|work=Blue Mountains, Australia, History|publisher=David Martin|year=2003|accessdate=7 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231004012/http://infobluemountains.net.au/history/lennox.htm|archive-date=31 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> It was closed in 1967 but later strengthened and repaired with an internal concrete structure and it re-opened in 1982.<ref name=BMCC_Report/><ref name=\"engheritage-sydney.org.au\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.engheritage-sydney.org.au/PDFs/Mitchell's.pdf|title=Mitchell\u2019s Pass and Lennox\u2019s Horseshoe Bridge, Lapstone|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216200352/http://qroti.com/placeinfo/qld/rail/kinkuna/|archive-date=16 February 2011|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nLennox Bridge [[Span (architecture)|spans]] the deep gully of Lapstone Creek at the head of the steepest part of Mitchell's Pass. The [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] are on bedrock, with the water running through a channel cut by Lennox's convicts in the bed of the creek. The bridge is quite small, with a span of only {{convert|20|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. The single arch is built of [[ashlar]]ed stone blocks mortared together. The arch on the south side has a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]] bearing the inscription \"DAVID LENNOX\", on the north side, \"AD 1833\", the packing of the bridge to either hand of the main ashlared section is of coursed rubble [[revetment]]s, making the total length of the bridge carriageway of almost {{convert|47|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. The stone [[parapet]]s are laid above a projecting [[plinth]] which begins just above the keystones. The area between the curve of the arch and the horizontal carriageway was packed with small rubble stone.<ref name=CMP/>\n\nThere was originally a damp-proof lime-mortar course above the vaulting, but this, together with most of the packing, was removed when the bridge was stripped back to the arch in 1976. During these repairs new concrete supports were inserted to bear the weight of a new carriageway utilising steel girders to take the traffic then still using Mitchell's Pass. These changes arc not visible, but the insertion of new blocks of stone and repairs to existing blocks on the main arch are legible. The original stone-cut channel for the creek still exists but is obscured by a concrete channel poured within Lennox's work during the 1976 repairs. Since Mitchell's Pass ceased to take the heavy traffic over the Blue Mountains, via the former Knapsack Railway Viaduct, the road is now one-way only downhill from Lennox Bridge and the traffic is largely for tourist purposes. There is a small amount of car-parking space beside the bridge and a concrete stairwell and path down to the creek on the west side. The visitor can safely walk under the bridge obtain the most attractive views.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 28 November 2013, the physical condition was good.<ref name=nswshr-24/> The bridge retains a high degree of original fabric. 1976 restorations do not detract from the significance of the built heritage item.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\nThe road was closed, the carriageway removed and the bridge stripped down to its bare stone arch in 1976. The Department of Main Roads decided that the stress had to be removed from the original arch and reconstructed the carriageway so that it was supported on two new concrete walls and borne on horizontal steel girders. With other repairs to the stonework and to the channel for the creek under the bridge, the road was reopened in 1976 with the new work largely concealed from view. With much reduced traffic flow and the road to the plains from the bridge made one-way only (downhill), the Lennox Bridge continues to serve as the oldest stone bridge on the Australian Mainland.<ref name=nswshr-24-246>Kullas, LGEA of NSW Journal, July 1983, 85- 86</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 28 November 2013, Lennox Bridge was the oldest stone bridge on the Australian mainland. It commands significance respect as the design of a newly arrived Scottish stone-mason, David Lennox, handpicked by the percipient [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]] and as the work of some twenty diligent, efficient, tightly supervised and technically able convicts. It was a necessary part of the road communications between [[Sydney]] and the West for over a century and proved remarkably durable. Its historical significance is augmented by its aesthetic and technical values. The original bridge, on a horseshoe curve, was daring, experimental and remarkably attractive; despite significant restoration work in 1976 the structure has retained a high degree of its original fabric and is in good condition. The work did not detracted from the aesthetic and technical values inherit in the design and fabric of the bridge. It has State Significance as the oldest bridge permitting vehicle transport on a route essential to the state's development.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\nLennox Bridge, Blaxland was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nLennox Bridge is the oldest stone bridge on the Australian mainland. It commands respect as the design of a newly arrived Scottish stone-mason handpicked by the percipient Surveyor General Thomas Mitchell and as the work of some twenty diligent, efficient, tightly supervised and technically able convicts. It was necessary part of the road communications between Sydney and the West for over a century and proved remarkably durable.

At forty-five years of age Lennox began service under Major Mitchell. Prior to arriving in the Colony he had spent seventeen years on public works executed at the expense of the British Government. During this time he constructed a number of wooden bridges associated with the Gloucester-Berkeley Canal and a stone bridge near [[Gloucester, New South Wales|Gloucester]]. In 1832, two years after the death of his wife, Lennox arrived on the Colony on the ''[[Florentia (1821 ship)|Florentia]]''. Not long after his arrival, he was discovered by Major Mitchell. On 1 October 1832, following the review of his credentials, Lennox was appointed to the Roads Department as the Sub-Inspector of Bridges. Within six weeks of his appointment Lennox and his men had cut most of the stone and procured lime for mortar. By July 1833, the bridge was complete. The success of Lennox's design is demonstrated through its on-going stability and continued use. Major restoration and safety improvement work was not required until the 1950s.\n\nLennox Bridge is also associated with at least twenty convicts, an overseer, a constable and an armed sentry that worked on the site between October 1832 and July 1833, the construction gang worked from 7am to 4pm, when they returned to their stockade at [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]]. The work involved stone cutting and setting, carpentry and masonry required to construct the bridge. Following completion of the bridge Lennox requested to retain the: services of eight convicts: William Brady, John Carsons, Robert Hyams, John Johnson, Patrick Malowney (Maloney), Thomas Nelson, James Randall and Daniel Williams. The sentences of six of the eight convicts were remitted. The remaining two were reduced after a further six months of work.<ref name=nswshr-24-247>Low, 1983, p12</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe original bridge, on a horse-shoe curve, was daring, experimental and remarkably attractive, The stonework has been restored some infelicities have been allowed on the revetment and the changes made in 1976 by introducing concrete to the stone-cut water channel beneath the bridge are unpleasing but David Lennox's concept for the bridge of a very pretty small gorge remains aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge was carried on a single semi-circular stone arch of ten feet radius. The roadway was thirty feet wide at the crown of the arch and the same height above the bed or the gully. After bearing over one hundred and seventy years of traffic and one major restoration still stands stable. The bridge is a very fine example of the work of David Lennox and represents the first scientifically constructed stone arched bridge of its magnitude In Australia.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nLennox Bridge is exceptionally rare. No other bridges of similar age or design have survived on the Australian mainland.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nLennox Bridge is the oldest scientifically constructed stone arch bridge on the Australian mainland. Having gained his bridge construction experience before arriving in the colony it is highly representative of the techniques used to construct stone bridges at the time in England.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Lennox_horseshoe2.JPG\nFile:Lennox_Bridge_surface.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian Roads}}}}\n* [[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=Attraction Homepage|date=2007|title=Lennox Bridge|url=http://www.bluemountainscitytourism.com.au/product/lennox-bridge-in-the-blue-mountains-9058925}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC-contains|name=Lennox Bridge|dno=5045255|id=00024|year=2018|accessdate=1 June 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Lennox Bridge, Glenbrook}}\n\n{{Road infrastructure in regional New South Wales}}\n{{Blue Mountains topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lennox Bridge}}\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:1833 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1833]]\n[[Category:Sandstone bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Stone arch bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Glenbrook, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Convictism in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Transport in the Blue Mountains (New South Wales)]]\n[[Category:Arch bridges in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "removedCategory:Arch bridges in AustraliausingHotCatduplicated category", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennox_Bridge,_Glenbrook"}

It has been important in [[Islamic pottery|Islamic]] and European [[pottery]], but very little used in East Asia. The pottery body is usually made of red or buff-colored [[earthenware]] and the white glaze imitated [[Chinese porcelain]].  The decoration on tin-glazed pottery is usually applied to the unfired glaze surface by brush with metallic oxides, commonly [[cobalt oxide]], [[copper (II) oxide|copper oxide]], [[iron oxide]], [[manganese dioxide]] and [[antimony]] oxide.  The makers of Italian tin-glazed pottery from the late [[Renaissance]] blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings.\n\nThe earliest tin-glazed pottery appears to have been made in [[Iraq]] in the 9th century, the oldest fragments having been excavated during the [[First World War]] from the palace of [[Samarra]] about fifty miles north of [[Baghdad]].<ref name=Caiger1973>Caiger-Smith, Alan, ''Tin-glazed Pottery in Europe and the Islamic World: The Tradition of 1000 Years in Maiolica, Faience and Delftware'' (Faber and Faber, 1973) {{ISBN|0-571-09349-3}}</ref>  From there it spread to Egypt, Persia and Spain before reaching [[Italy]] in mid-15th century, early [[Renaissance]], [[Holland]] in the 16th century and [[England]], [[France]] and other European countries shortly after.\n\nThe development of white, or near white, firing bodies in Europe from the late 18th century, such as [[creamware]] by [[Josiah Wedgwood]], and increasingly cheap [[Porcelain#European porcelain|European porcelain]] and [[Chinese export porcelain]], reduced the demand for tin-glaze [[Delftware]], [[faience]] and [[majolica]].\n\nThe rise in the cost of tin oxide during the First World War led to its partial substitution by [[zirconium]] compounds in the glaze.\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Chinese white ware and Iraqi earthenware bowls 9th 10th century both found in Iraq.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[porcelain]] white ware bowl, not tin-glazed (left), found in [[Iran]], and Iraqi tin-glazed earthenware bowl (right) found in [[Iraq]], both 9-10th century, an example of [[Chinese influences on Islamic pottery]]. [[British Museum]].]]\nTin-glazed pottery of different periods and styles is known by different names.  The pottery from Muslim Spain is known as ''[[Hispano-Moresque ware]]''. The decorated tin-glaze of Renaissance Italy is called ''[[maiolica]]'', sometimes pronounced and spelt ''majolica'' by English speakers and authors. When the technique was taken up in the Netherlands, it became known as ''[[delftware]]'' as much of it was made in the town of [[Delft]]. Dutch potters brought it to England in around 1600, and wares produced there are known as ''[[English Delftware|English delftware]]'' or ''galleyware''. In France it was known as ''[[faience]]''.\n\nThe word ''maiolica'' is thought to have come from the medieval Italian word for [[Majorca]], an island on the route for ships that brought Hispano-Moresque wares to Italy from [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, or from the Spanish ''obra de Mallequa'', the term for lustered ware made in Valencia under the influence of Moorish craftsmen from Malaga. During the Renaissance, the term ''maiolica'' was adopted for Italian-made [[lusterware|luster pottery]] copying Spanish examples, and, during the 16th century, its meaning shifted to include all tin-glazed earthenware.\n\nBecause of their identical names, there has been some confusion between tin-glazed majolica/maiolica and the lead-glazed majolica made in England and America in the 19th century, but they are different in origin, technique, style and history. In the late 18th century, old Italian tin-glazed maiolica became popular among  the British, who referred to it by the anglicized pronunciation ''majolica''. The [[Mintons Ltd|Minton]] pottery copied it and applied the term ''majolica ware'' to their product. At the Great Exhibition of 1851, Minton launched the colorful [[lead-glazed earthenware]] which they called ''[[Palissy ware]]'', soon also to become known as ''majolica''. So now we have two distinct products with the same name. \"In the 1870s, the curators of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]] returned to the original Italian 'maiolica' with an 'i' to describe all Italian tin-glazed earthenware, doubtless to stress the Italian pronunciation and to avoid confusion with contemporary majolica.\"<ref>https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/a-z-of-ceramics/  Victoria and Albert Museum, \"Ceramics - M is for Maiolica/majolica\"]</ref>\n\n:''For the article about 19th century lead-glazed earthenware, see [[Victorian majolica]]''\n\nW.B. Honey (Keeper of Ceramics at the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]], 1938\u20131950) wrote of ''maiolica'' that, \"By a convenient extension and limitation the name may be applied to all tin-glazed ware, of whatever nationality, made in the Italian tradition \u2026 the name fa\u00efence (or the synonymous English 'delftware') being reserved for the later wares of the 17th Century onwards, either in original styles (as in the case of the French) or, more frequently, in the Dutch-Chinese (Delft) tradition.\"<ref name=Honey>Honey, W.B., ''European Ceramic Art'', 1952</ref>  The term ''maiolica'' is sometimes applied to modern tin-glazed ware made by studio potters.<ref>See, for example, ''The New Maiolica'' by Matthias Osterman.</ref>\n\n==Hispano-Moresque ware==\n{{main|Hispano-Moresque ware}}\n\n[[File:hispanomoresque.JPG|thumb|right|A Hispano-Moresque dish, approx 32cm diameter, with Christian monogram \"IHS\", decorated in cobalt blue and gold luster.

[[Burrell Collection]]]]\nThe [[Moors]] introduced tin-glazed pottery to Spain after the conquest of 711.\n\nHispano-Moresque ware is generally distinguished from the pottery of Christendom by the Islamic character of its decoration,<ref name=Caiger1973/> though as the dish illustrated shows, it was also made for the Christian market.\n\nHispano-Moresque shapes of the 15th century included the ''[[albarello]]'' (a tall jar), luster dishes with [[Coat of Arms|coats of arms]], made for wealthy Italians and Spaniards, jugs, some on high feet (the ''citra'' and the ''grealet''), a deep-sided dish (the ''lebrillo de alo'') and the eared bowl (''cuenco de oreja'').\n\nWith the Spanish conquest of [[Mexico]], tin-glazed pottery came to be produced in the Valley of Mexico as early as 1540, at first in imitation of the ceramics imported from [[Seville]].<ref>Lister</ref>\n\nAlthough the Moors were expelled from Spain in the early 17th century, the Hispano-Moresque style survived in the province of Valencia.  Later wares usually have a coarse reddish-buff body, dark blue decoration and luster.\n\n==Maiolica==\n{{main|Maiolica}}\n\n[[File:albarello.JPG|thumb|right|An albarello (drug jar) from Venice or Castel Durante, 16th century.  Approx 30cm high.  Decorated in cobalt blue, copper green, antimony yellow and yellow ochre.  [[Burrell Collection]]]]The 15th-century wares that initiated maiolica as an art form were the product of a long technical evolution, in which medieval lead-glazed wares were improved by the addition of tin oxides under the initial influence of Islamic wares imported through Sicily.<ref>Goldthwaite, p.1</ref>  Such archaic wares<ref>Blake</ref> are sometimes dubbed ''proto-maiolica''.<ref>Whitehouse</ref>  During the later 14th century, the limited palette of colors was expanded from the traditional manganese purple and copper green to embrace cobalt blue, antimony yellow and iron-oxide orange. ''Sgraffito'' wares were also produced, in which the white tin-oxide slip was decoratively scratched to produce a design from the revealed body of the ware.\n\nRefined production of tin-glazed earthenware made for more than local needs was concentrated in central Italy from the later 13th century, especially in the ''contada'' of [[Florence]].  The importance of the city itself in the production of maiolica declined in the second half of the 15th century, perhaps because of local [[deforestation]]. Italian cities encouraged the start of a new pottery industry by offering tax relief, citizenship, monopoly rights and protection from outside imports.  Production scattered among small communes<ref>Galeazzo Cora (1973) noted kilns dispersed at Bacchereto (a center of production from the fourteenth century), Puntormo, [[Prato]] and [[Pistoia]], none of them site-names that have circulated among connoisseurs and collectors.</ref> and, after the mid-15th century, at [[Faenza]], [[Arezzo]] and [[Siena]]. Faenza, which gave its name to [[faience]], was the only fair-sized city in which the ceramic industry became a major economic component.<ref>Goldthwaite p.14</ref> [[Bologna]] produced lead-glazed wares for export.  [[Orvieto]] and [[Deruta]] both produced ''maioliche'' in the 15th century.  In the 16th century, maiolica production was established at [[Castel Durante]], [[Urbino]], [[Gubbio]] and [[Pesaro]].  Some maiolica was produced as far north as [[Padua]], [[Venice]] and [[Turin]] and as far south as [[Palermo]] and [[Caltagirone]] in Sicily.<ref name=Caiger1973/><ref>Rackham, p. 9</ref><ref>L. Arnoux, 1877, British Manufacturing Industries - Pottery \"Most of the Italian towns had their manufactory, each of them possessing a style of its own. Beginning at Caffagiolo and Deruta, they extended rapidly to Gubbio, Ferrara, and Ravenna, to be continued to Casteldurante, Rimini, Urbino, Florence, Venice, and many other places.\"</ref>In the 17th century [[Savona]] began to be a prominent place of manufacture.\n\nSome of the principal centers of production (e.g. [[Deruta]] and [[Montelupo Fiorentino|Montelupo]]) still produce maiolica, which is sold in quantity in Italian tourist areas.\n\n==Delftware==\n{{main|Delftware}}\n\nDelftware was made in the Netherlands from the 16th to the 18th centuries. The main period of manufacture was 1600-1780, after which it was succeeded by white stoneware and porcelain.\n\nThe earliest tin-glazed pottery in the Netherlands was made in Antwerp in 1512. The manufacture of painted pottery may have spread from the southern to the northern Netherlands in the 1560s. It was made in Middleburg and Haarlem in the 1570s and in Amsterdam in the 1580s.<ref name=Caiger1973/>  Much of the finer work was produced in Delft, but simple everyday tin-glazed pottery was made in such places as Gouda, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Dordrecht.<ref name=Caiger1973/>\n\nThe [[Guild of St. Luke]], to which painters in all media had to belong, admitted ten master potters in the thirty years between 1610 and 1640 and twenty in the nine years 1651 to 1660. In 1654 a gunpowder explosion in Delft destroyed many breweries, and, as the brewing industry was in decline, their premises became available to pottery makers.<ref name=Caiger1973/>\n\nFrom about 1615, the potters began to coat their pots completely in white tin glaze instead of covering only the painting surface and coating the rest with clear glaze. They then began to cover the tin glaze with a coat of clear glaze which gave depth to the fired surface and smoothness to [[cobalt]] blues, ultimately creating a good resemblance to porcelain.<ref name=Caiger1973/>\n\nAlthough Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do after the death of the Emperor [[Wan-Li]] in 1619, when the supply to Europe was interrupted.<ref name=Caiger1973/> Delftware inspired by Chinese originals persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.\n\nDelftware ranged from simple household items to fancy artwork. Pictorial plates were made in abundance, illustrated with religious motifs, native Dutch scenes with [[windmills]] and [[fishing]] [[boat]]s, hunting scenes, landscapes and seascapes. The Delft potters also made tiles in vast numbers (estimated at eight hundred million over a period of two hundred years<ref name=Caiger1973/>); many Dutch houses still have tiles that were fixed in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nDelftware became popular, was widely exported in Europe and reached China and Japan. Chinese and Japanese potters made porcelain versions of Delftware for export to Europe.\n\nBy the late 18th century, Delftware potters had lost their market to British porcelain and the new white earthenware.\n\nThere are good collections of old Delftware in the [[Rijksmuseum]] and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].\n\n==English delftware==\n[[File:Charger, English, 1730-1740, earthenware with tin glaze - Chazen Museum of Art - DSC02213.JPG|File:Charger, English, 1730-1740, earthenware with tin glaze - Chazen Museum of Art - DSC02213.JPG|thumb|Charger, [[English delftware]], 1730-1740, the decoration here an early and charmingly naive attempt at [[chinoiserie]]]]\n{{main|English Delftware}}\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ajvdelft.jpg|thumb|English delftware drug jar circa 1720-40 (copyright ajv private collection)|{{puic|1=Ajvdelft.jpg|log=2009 February 28}}]] -->English delftware was made in the British Isles between about 1550 and the late 18th century.  The main centers of production were [[London]], [[Bristol]] and [[Liverpool]] with smaller centers at [[Wincanton]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Dublin]].\n\n[[John Stow]]'s ''Survey of London'' (1598) records the arrival in 1567 of two Antwerp potters, Jasper Andries and Jacob Jansen, in [[Norwich]], where they made \"Gally Paving Tiles, and vessels for Apothecaries and others, very artificially\".<ref name=Caiger1973/> In 1579 Jansen applied to [[Queen Elizabeth I]] for the sole right to practice \"galleypotting\" in London and soon set up a workshop at [[Aldgate]] to the east of the city.  There were already other Flemish potters in London, two of them in [[Southwark]] recorded in 1571 as \"painters of pottes\".<ref name=Caiger1973/>\n\nEnglish delftware pottery and its painted decoration is similar in many respects to that from Holland, but its peculiarly English quality has been commented upon: \"...&nbsp;there is a relaxed tone and a sprightliness which is preserved throughout the history of English delftware; the overriding mood is provincial and naive rather than urbane and sophisticated.\"<ref>Carnegy, p.51. Caiger-Smith describes its mood as \"ingenuous, direct, sometimes eccentric\", and Garner talks of its \"quite distinctive character\".</ref> Its methods and techniques were less sophisticated than those of its continental counterparts.\n\nThe earliest known piece with an English inscription is a dish dated 1600 in the London Museum. It is painted in blue, purple, green, orange and yellow and depicts the Tower of London and Old London Bridge, surrounded by the words, \"THE ROSE IS RED THE LEAVES ARE GRENE GOD SAVE ELIZABETH OUR QUEENE\" and an Italianate border of masks and leaves. The rim is decorated with dashes of blue and can be considered the first in series of large decorated dishes so painted and called blue-dash chargers.

''Fa\u00efence parlante'' bears mottoes often on decorative labels or banners. [[Apothecary]] wares, including ''[[albarello|albarelli]]'', can bear the names of their intended contents, generally in Latin and often so abbreviated to be unrecognizable to the untutored eye.

[[British Museum]].]]\nTin-glazed pottery of different periods and styles is known by different names.  The pottery from Muslim Spain is known as ''[[Hispano-Moresque ware]]''. The decorated tin-glaze of Renaissance Italy is called ''[[maiolica]]'', sometimes pronounced and spelt ''majolica'' by English speakers and authors. When the technique was taken up in the Netherlands, it became known as ''[[delftware]]'' as much of it was made in the town of [[Delft]]. Dutch potters brought it to England in around 1600, and wares produced there are known as ''[[English Delftware|English delftware]]'' or ''galleyware''. In France it was known as ''[[faience]]''.\n\nThe word ''maiolica'' is thought to have come from the medieval Italian word for [[Majorca]], an island on the route for ships that brought Hispano-Moresque wares to Italy from [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] in the 15th and 16th centuries, or from the Spanish ''obra de Mallequa'', the term for lustered ware made in Valencia under the influence of Moorish craftsmen from Malaga. During the Renaissance, the term ''maiolica'' was adopted for Italian-made [[lusterware|luster pottery]] copying Spanish examples, and, during the 16th century, its meaning shifted to include all tin-glazed earthenware.\n\nBecause of their identical names, there has been some confusion between tin-glazed majolica/maiolica and the lead-glazed majolica made in England and America in the 19th century, but they are different in origin, technique, style and history. In the late 18th century, old Italian tin-glazed maiolica became popular among  the British, who referred to it by the anglicized pronunciation ''majolica''. The [[Mintons Ltd|Minton]] pottery copied it and applied the term ''majolica ware'' to their product. At the Great Exhibition of 1851, Minton launched the colorful [[lead-glazed earthenware]] which they called ''[[Palissy ware]]'', soon also to become known as ''majolica''. So now we have two distinct products with the same name. \"In the 1870s, the curators of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|South Kensington Museum]] returned to the original Italian 'maiolica' with an 'i' to describe all Italian tin-glazed earthenware, doubtless to stress the Italian pronunciation and to avoid confusion with contemporary majolica.\"<ref>https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/a-z-of-ceramics/  Victoria and Albert Museum, \"Ceramics - M is for Maiolica/majolica\"]</ref>\n\n:''For the article about 19th century lead-glazed earthenware, see [[Victorian majolica]]''\n\nW.B. Honey (Keeper of Ceramics at the [[Victoria & Albert Museum]], 1938\u20131950) wrote of ''maiolica'' that, \"By a convenient extension and limitation the name may be applied to all tin-glazed ware, of whatever nationality, made in the Italian tradition \u2026 the name fa\u00efence (or the synonymous English 'delftware') being reserved for the later wares of the 17th Century onwards, either in original styles (as in the case of the French) or, more frequently, in the Dutch-Chinese (Delft) tradition.\"<ref name=Honey>Honey, W.B., ''European Ceramic Art'', 1952</ref>  The term ''maiolica'' is sometimes applied to modern tin-glazed ware made by studio potters.<ref>See, for example, ''The New Maiolica'' by Matthias Osterman.</ref>\n\n==Hispano-Moresque ware==\n{{main|Hispano-Moresque ware}}\n\n[[File:hispanomoresque.JPG|thumb|right|A Hispano-Moresque dish, approx 32cm diameter, with Christian monogram \"IHS\", decorated in cobalt blue and gold luster.

[[Burrell Collection]]]]The 15th-century wares that initiated maiolica as an art form were the product of a long technical evolution, in which medieval lead-glazed wares were improved by the addition of tin oxides under the initial influence of Islamic wares imported through Sicily.<ref>Goldthwaite, p.1</ref>  Such archaic wares<ref>Blake</ref> are sometimes dubbed ''proto-maiolica''.<ref>Whitehouse</ref>  During the later 14th century, the limited palette of colors was expanded from the traditional manganese purple and copper green to embrace cobalt blue, antimony yellow and iron-oxide orange. ''Sgraffito'' wares were also produced, in which the white tin-oxide slip was decoratively scratched to produce a design from the revealed body of the ware.\n\nRefined production of tin-glazed earthenware made for more than local needs was concentrated in central Italy from the later 13th century, especially in the ''contada'' of [[Florence]].  The city itself declined in importance in the second half of the 15th century, perhaps because of local [[deforestation]]. Italian cities encouraged the start of a new pottery industry by offering tax relief, citizenship, monopoly rights and protection from outside imports.  Production scattered among small communes<ref>Galeazzo Cora (1973) noted kilns dispersed at Bacchereto (a center of production from the fourteenth century), Puntormo, [[Prato]] and [[Pistoia]], none of them site-names that have circulated among connoisseurs and collectors.</ref> and, after the mid-15th century, at [[Faenza]], [[Arezzo]] and [[Siena]].

[[Orvieto]] and [[Deruta]] both produced ''maioliche'' in the 15th century.  In the 16th century, maiolica production was established at [[Castel Durante]], [[Urbino]], [[Gubbio]] and [[Pesaro]].

The main period of manufacture was 1600-1780, after which it was succeeded by white stoneware and porcelain.\n\nThe earliest tin-glazed pottery in the Netherlands was made in Antwerp in 1512. The manufacture of painted pottery may have spread from the southern to the northern Netherlands in the 1560s. It was made in Middleburg and Haarlem in the 1570s and in Amsterdam in the 1580s.<ref name=Caiger1973/>  Much of the finer work was produced in Delft, but simple everyday tin-glazed pottery was made in such places as Gouda, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Dordrecht.<ref name=Caiger1973/>\n\nThe [[Guild of St. Luke]], to which painters in all media had to belong, admitted ten master potters in the thirty years between 1610 and 1640 and twenty in the nine years 1651 to 1660. In 1654 a gunpowder explosion in Delft destroyed many breweries, and, as the brewing industry was in decline, their premises became available to pottery makers.<ref name=Caiger1973/>\n\nFrom about 1615, the potters began to coat their pots completely in white tin glaze instead of covering only the painting surface and coating the rest with clear glaze. They then began to cover the tin glaze with a coat of clear glaze which gave depth to the fired surface and smoothness to [[cobalt]] blues, ultimately creating a good resemblance to porcelain.<ref name=Caiger1973/>\n\nAlthough Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do after the death of the Emperor [[Wan-Li]] in 1619, when the supply to Europe was interrupted.<ref name=Caiger1973/> Delftware inspired by Chinese originals persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.\n\nDelftware ranged from simple household items to fancy artwork. Pictorial plates were made in abundance, illustrated with religious motifs, native Dutch scenes with [[windmills]] and [[fishing]] [[boat]]s, hunting scenes, landscapes and seascapes. The Delft potters also made tiles in vast numbers (estimated at eight hundred million over a period of two hundred years<ref name=Caiger1973/>); many Dutch houses still have tiles that were fixed in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nDelftware became popular, was widely exported in Europe and reached China and Japan. Chinese and Japanese potters made porcelain versions of Delftware for export to Europe.\n\nBy the late 18th century, Delftware potters had lost their market to British porcelain and the new white earthenware.\n\nThere are good collections of old Delftware in the [[Rijksmuseum]] and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]].\n\n==English delftware==\n[[File:Charger, English, 1730-1740, earthenware with tin glaze - Chazen Museum of Art - DSC02213.JPG|File:Charger, English, 1730-1740, earthenware with tin glaze - Chazen Museum of Art - DSC02213.JPG|thumb|Charger, [[English delftware]], 1730-1740, the decoration here an early and charmingly naive attempt at [[chinoiserie]]]]\n{{main|English Delftware}}\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ajvdelft.jpg|thumb|English delftware drug jar circa 1720-40 (copyright ajv private collection)|{{puic|1=Ajvdelft.jpg|log=2009 February 28}}]] -->English delftware was made in the British Isles between about 1550 and the late 18th century.

There were already other Flemish potters in London, two of them in [[Southwark]] recorded in 1571 as \"painters of pottes\".<ref name=Caiger1973/>\n\nEnglish delftware pottery and its painted decoration is similar in many respects to that from Holland, but its peculiarly English quality has been commented upon: \"...&nbsp;there is a relaxed tone and a sprightliness which is preserved throughout the history of English delftware; the overriding mood is provincial and naive rather than urbane and sophisticated.\"<ref>Carnegy, p.51.

Bull, The Institute Of Ceramics & Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1986</ref> Whilst zirconium compounds are not as effective opacifiers as tin oxide, their relatively low price has led to a gradual increase in their use, with an associated reduction in the use of tin oxide. The whiteness resulting from the use of zirconia has been described as more \"clinical\" than that from tin oxide and is preferred in some applications.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Science For Craft Potters And Enamellers'', K. Shaw, A.H. & A.W. Reed, Wellington, 1973</ref>  Nevertheless, tin oxide still finds use in ceramic manufacture and has been widely used as the opacifier in sanitaryware,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> with up to 6% used in glazes.<ref>''Sanitaryware'', D. Fortuna, Gruppo Editoriale Faenza Editrice s.p.a., Florence, 2000</ref> Otherwise, tin oxide in glazes, often in conjunction with zircon compounds, is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref>''Ceramic Glazes'', F. Singer & W.L. German, Borax Consolidated Limited, London, 1960</ref>\n\nIn England at the end of the nineteenth century, [[William de Morgan]] re-discovered the technique of firing luster on tin-glaze \"to an extraordinarily high standard\".<ref>Carnegy, p.65</ref> Since the beginning of the 20th century there has been a revival of pottery-making in Orvieto and Deruta, the traditional centres of tin-glazed ceramics in Italy, where the shapes and designs of the medieval and renaissance period are reproduced.<ref>Cremona, J. and Andreis, T., ''Buongiorno Italia!'', London: BBC Books, 1982</ref> In the 1920s and 1930s, [[Roger Fry]], [[Vanessa Bell]]  and [[Duncan Grant]] decorated tin-glazed pottery for the [[Omega Workshops]] in London.<ref>Anscombe, p.136</ref>  Picasso produced and designed much tin-glazed pottery at [[Vallauris]] in the south of France in the 1940s and 1950s. At the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]], London, [[Dora Billington]] encouraged her students, including [[William R. Newland (potter)|William Newland]] and [[Alan Caiger-Smith]], to use tin-glaze decoration. In Britain during the 1950s Caiger-Smith, Margaret Hine, [[Nicholas Vergette]] and others including the [[Rye Pottery]] made tin-glazed pottery, going against the trend in studio pottery towards [[stoneware]]. Subsequently, Caiger-Smith experimented with the technique of reduced lustre on tin glaze, which had been practiced in Italy until 1700 and Spain until 1800 and had then been forgotten.<ref>Caiger-Smith, Alan, ''Lustre Pottery: Technique, Tradition and Innovation in Islam and the Western World''(Faber and Faber, 1985) {{ISBN|0-571-13507-2}}</ref> Caiger-Smith trained several potters at his Aldermaston Pottery and published ''Tin-glaze Pottery'' which gives a history of maiolica, delftware and faience in Europe and the Islamic world.<ref>'Tin-Glaze Pottery in Europe and the Islamic World: The Tradition of 1000 Years in Maiolica, Faience and Delftware.'
