Subsequently, there occurred a mass conversion of the [[Berber people|Berbers]] to Islam. [[Kharijites]] or Islamic \"outsiders\" who formed an egalitarian and puritanical sect appeared and are still present on the island of [[Djerba]]. In 745, [[Kharijite]] [[Berber people|Berbers]] captured Kairouan, which was already at that time a developed city with luxuriant gardens and olive groves. Power struggles continued until [[Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab]] recaptured Kairouan at the end of the 8th century. In 800 [[Caliph]] [[Harun ar-Rashid]] in [[Baghdad]] confirmed Ibrahim as [[Emir]] and hereditary ruler of [[Ifriqiya]]. Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab founded the [[Aghlabid]] dynasty which ruled [[Ifriqiya]] between 800 and 909. The new Emirs embellished Kairouan and made it their capital. It soon became famous for its wealth and prosperity, reaching the levels of [[Basra]] and [[Kufa]] and giving Tunisia one of its golden ages long sought{{by whom|date=August 2014}} after the glorious days of [[Carthage]].\n\nThe [[Aghlabite]]s built the great mosque and established in it a university that was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences. Its role can be compared to that of the [[University of Paris]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. In the 9th century, the city became a brilliant focus of [[Arab]] and [[Islamic]] cultures attracting scholars from all over the [[Islamic World]]. In that period [[Imam]] [[Sahnun]] and [[Asad ibn al-Furat]] made of Kairouan a temple of knowledge and a magnificent centre of diffusion of Islamic sciences. The Aghlabids also built palaces, fortifications and fine waterworks of which only the pools remain. From Kairouan envoys from [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] returned with glowing reports of the [[Aghlabite]]s palaces, libraries and gardens \u2013 and from the crippling taxation imposed to pay for their drunkenness and sundry debaucheries. The [[Aghlabite]] also pacified the country and conquered Sicily in 827.<ref>[https://books.google.fr/books?id=qamIQbPLMqgC&pg=PA48&dq=aghlabids+conquered+sicily+in+827&cd=7#v=onepage&q=aghlabids%20conquered%20sicily%20in%20827&f=false Barbara M.

The year 909 saw the overthrow of the [[Sunni]] [[Aghlabite]]s who ruled [[Ifriqiya]] and the establishment of the Fatimid dynasty. During the rule of the [[Fatimid]]s, Kairouan was neglected and lost its importance: the new rulers resided first in Raqqada but soon moved their capital to the newly built [[Al Mahdiyah]] on the coast of modern Tunisia. After succeeding in extending their rule over all of central [[Maghreb]], an area consisting of the modern countries of [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]], they eventually moved east to [[Egypt]] to found [[Cairo]] making it the capital of their vast [[Caliphate]] and leaving the [[Zirids]] as their vassals in [[Ifriqiya]]. Governing again from Kairouan, the [[Zirids]] led the country through another artistic, commercial and agricultural heyday. Schools and universities flourished, overseas trade in local manufactures and farm produce ran high and the courts of the [[Zirids]] rulers were centres of refinement that eclipsed those of their European contemporaries. When the [[Zirids]] declared their independence from [[Cairo]] and their conversion to [[Sunni]] Islam in 1045 by giving allegiance to [[Baghdad]], the Fatimid Caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]] sent as punishment hordes of troublesome Arab tribes ([[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]]) to invade Ifriqiya. These invaders so utterly destroyed Kairouan in 1057 that it never regained its former importance and their influx was a major factor in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant. Some 1,700 years of intermittent but continual progress was undone within a decade as in most part of the country the land was laid to waste for nearly two centuries. In the 13th century under the prosperous [[Hafsids]] dynasty that ruled Ifriqiya, the city started to emerge from its ruins. It is only under the [[Husainid Dynasty]] that Kairouan started to find an honorable place in the country and throughout the Islamic world. In 1881, Kairouan was taken by the French, after which non-Muslims were allowed access to the city. The French built the {{track gauge|600 mm}} [[Sousse\u2013Kairouan Decauville railway]], which operated from 1882 to 1996, before it was regauged to {{track gauge|1000 mm}} gauge.{{cn|date=March

During this period, the Great Mosque of Kairouan was both a place of prayer and a center for teaching Islamic sciences under the Maliki current.

Subsequently, there occurred a mass conversion of the [[Berber people|Berbers]] to Islam. [[Kharijites]] or Islamic \"outsiders\" who formed an egalitarian and puritanical sect appeared and are still present on the island of [[Djerba]]. In 745, [[Kharijite]] [[Berber people|Berbers]] captured Kairouan, which was already at that time a developed city with luxuriant gardens and olive groves. Power struggles continued until [[Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab]] recaptured Kairouan at the end of the 8th century. In 800 [[Caliph]] [[Harun ar-Rashid]] in [[Baghdad]] confirmed Ibrahim as [[Emir]] and hereditary ruler of [[Ifriqiya]]. Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab founded the [[Aghlabid]] dynasty which ruled [[Ifriqiya]] between 800 and 909. The new Emirs embellished Kairouan and made it their capital. It soon became famous for its wealth and prosperity, reaching the levels of [[Basra]] and [[Kufa]] and giving Tunisia one of its golden ages long sought{{by whom|date=August 2014}} after the glorious days of [[Carthage]].\n\nThe [[Aghlabite]]s built the great mosque and established in it a university that was a centre of education both in Islamic thought and in the secular sciences. Its role can be compared to that of the [[University of Paris]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. In the 9th century, the city became a brilliant focus of [[Arab]] and [[Islamic]] cultures attracting scholars from all over the [[Islamic World]]. In that period [[Imam]] [[Sahnun]] and [[Asad ibn al-Furat]] made of Kairouan a temple of knowledge and a magnificent centre of diffusion of Islamic sciences. The Aghlabids also built palaces, fortifications and fine waterworks of which only the pools remain. From Kairouan envoys from [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] returned with glowing reports of the [[Aghlabite]]s palaces, libraries and gardens \u2013 and from the crippling taxation imposed to pay for their drunkenness and sundry debaucheries. The [[Aghlabite]] also pacified the country and conquered Sicily in 827.<ref>[https://books.google.fr/books?id=qamIQbPLMqgC&pg=PA48&dq=aghlabids+conquered+sicily+in+827&cd=7#v=onepage&q=aghlabids%20conquered%20sicily%20in%20827&f=false Barbara M.

The year 909 saw the overthrow of the [[Sunni]] [[Aghlabite]]s who ruled [[Ifriqiya]] and the establishment of the Fatimid dynasty. During the rule of the [[Fatimid]]s, Kairouan was neglected and lost its importance: the new rulers resided first in Raqqada but soon moved their capital to the newly built [[Al Mahdiyah]] on the coast of modern Tunisia. After succeeding in extending their rule over all of central [[Maghreb]], an area consisting of the modern countries of [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Libya]], they eventually moved east to [[Egypt]] to found [[Cairo]] making it the capital of their vast [[Caliphate]] and leaving the [[Zirids]] as their vassals in [[Ifriqiya]]. Governing again from Kairouan, the [[Zirids]] led the country through another artistic, commercial and agricultural heyday. Schools and universities flourished, overseas trade in local manufactures and farm produce ran high and the courts of the [[Zirids]] rulers were centres of refinement that eclipsed those of their European contemporaries. When the [[Zirids]] declared their independence from [[Cairo]] and their conversion to [[Sunni]] Islam in 1045 by giving allegiance to [[Baghdad]], the Fatimid Caliph [[Ma'ad al-Mustansir Billah]] sent as punishment hordes of troublesome Arab tribes ([[Banu Hilal]] and [[Banu Sulaym]]) to invade Ifriqiya. These invaders so utterly destroyed Kairouan in 1057 that it never regained its former importance and their influx was a major factor in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant. Some 1,700 years of intermittent but continual progress was undone within a decade as in most part of the country the land was laid to waste for nearly two centuries. In the 13th century under the prosperous [[Hafsids]] dynasty that ruled Ifriqiya, the city started to emerge from its ruins. It is only under the [[Husainid Dynasty]] that Kairouan started to find an honorable place in the country and throughout the Islamic world. In 1881, Kairouan was taken by the French, after which non-Muslims were allowed access to the city. The French built the {{track gauge|600 mm}} [[Sousse\u2013Kairouan Decauville railway]], which operated from 1882 to 1996, before it was regauged to {{track gauge|1000 mm}} gauge.{{cn|date=March

During this period, the Great Mosque of Kairouan was both a place of prayer and a center for teaching Islamic sciences under the Maliki current. One may conceivably compare its role to that of the University of Paris during the Middle Ages.<ref>{{citation |author=Henri Saladin |title=Tunis et Kairouan |language=fr |edition=Henri Laurens |location=[[Paris]] |year=1908 |page=118}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to studies on the deepening of religious thought and Maliki jurisprudence, the mosque also hosted various courses in secular subjects such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine and botany. The transmission of knowledge was assured by prominent scholars and theologians which included [[Sahnun|Sahnun ibn Sa'id]] and [[Asad ibn al-Furat]], eminent jurists who contributed greatly to the dissemination of the Maliki thought, Ishaq ibn Imran and Ibn al-Jazzar in medicine, Abu Sahl al-Kairouani and Abd al-Monim al-Kindi in mathematics. Thus the mosque, headquarters of a prestigious university with a large library containing many scientific and theological works, was the most remarkable intellectual and cultural center in North Africa during the ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nA unique religious tradition in Kairouan was the use of Islamic [[Sharia|law]] to enforce [[monogamy]] by stipulating it in the marriage contract, a practice common among both elites and commoners. This stipulation gave a woman legal recourse in the case that her husband sought to take [[polygyny|a second wife]]. Although the introduction of the 1956 [[Code of Personal Status in Tunisia|Code of Personal Status]] rendered the tradition obsolete by outlawing polygamy nationwide, some scholars have identified it as a \"positive tradition for women within the large framework of Islamic law.\"<ref name=\"Monogamy in Islam: The case of a Tunisian Marriage Contract\">{{Cite paper |last=Largueche |first=Dalenda |title=Monogamy in Islam: The Case of a Tunisian Marriage Contract |journal=Occasional Paper of the IAS School of Social Science |publication-date=2010 |url=https://www.sss.ias.edu/files/papers/paper39.pdf |lay-date=2017-05-28}}</ref>\n\n==Main sights==\n\n===Great Mosque of Sidi-Uqba===\n{{main|Great Mosque of Kairouan}}\n[[File:Fa\u00e7ade of the Mosque of the Three Gates.jpg|thumb|upright|Fa\u00e7ade of the Mosque of the Three Gates with its minaret]]\n\nThe city's main attraction is the [[Great Mosque of Sidi-Uqba]], which is said to largely consist of its original building materials.

It stars [[Damien Bonnard]], Alexis Manenti, Djebril Zonga, Issa Percia, Al-Hassan Ly, Steve Tientcheu, Almany Kanoute and Nizar Ben Fatma. The film is based on police violence on 14 October 2008 in [[Montfermeil]], observed and filmed by Ladj Ly. Montfermeil is a suburb 25 kilometers northeast of [[Paris]] where, in [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 novel ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', former convict Jean Valjean meets Cosette, a girl abused by her adoptive parents. The film describes abuses against poor citizens, especially teenagers, of African or Arabic ethnicities, thus stressing the continuity in the fate of the poor in Montfermeil.  \n\nIt had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on 15 May 2019. It was released in France on 20 November 2019 by Le Pacte. It was selected as the French entry for the [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]] at the [[92nd Academy Awards]]. It went on to win four [[45th C\u00e9sar Awards|C\u00e9sar Awards]], including [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]], and other honours.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with images of the crowd celebrating on [[Paris|Paris']] Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es the victory of the French team at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], which had been perceived, and celebrated in France as a moment of brotherhood between people of different social classes or ethnicities. \n\nPolice officer St\u00e9phane Ruiz moves to a Paris suburb to get a better chance at gaining custody of his son from his divorced wife and gets a job with the SCU's anti-crime brigade on duty in the nearby city of [[Montfermeil]]. St\u00e9phane Ruiz is assigned to work with brigadier Gwada and squad leader \"Pink Pig\" Chris. Chris often and aggressively abuses his power to frisk young girls, which reminds of Cosette's fate. Gwada is complacent with that abuse.\n\nCircus leader Zorro has a lion cub stolen from him by young slum kid Issa and confronts the slum's mayor about it. The squadron steps in and promises to find the cub and Zorro threatens to return with firearms if they do not find it. Chris finds Issa when he brags on Instagram about stealing the cub. They chase him down, but when Chris asks him where the cub is, he claims it ran away. Issa's friends surround the squadron and attempt to free him, and Gwada accidentally teargasses himself in the process. When a panicked Issa runs, a delirious Gwada shoots him in the face with a flash ball. Drone-obsessed teen Buzz catches the confrontation on video and plans to release it. Chris spots the drone, and the squadron sets out to locate it, taking a severely injured Issa with them.\n\nChris uses his local neighborhood contact to find Buzz and leaves Issa with them. Buzz is in the process of uploading his video when the squadron arrives. Buzz flees with the memory card while Gwada destroys his drone. Buzz takes shelter with restaurant owner Salah just as the squadron and the mayor arrived. After a tense confrontation in which Chris attempts to illegally arrest Buzz, Ruiz convinces Salah (whom he had met before) to give him the memory card. Chris' contact drops off Issa just as HQ radios in that the cub was spotted in a nearby park.\n\nThe squadron captures the cub and takes it back to Zorro, making Issa apologize. Zorro dangles Issa in front of a fully grown lion, scaring him into wetting himself. Deciding Issa has learned his lesson, Chris drops him off and warns him not to tell anyone what happened. Ruiz reveals he has the memory card and threatens to release it, which Chris angrily warns him against. A distraught Gwada goes home to his elderly mother, a seemingly unaffected Chris goes home to his family, and Ruiz goes home to his still unpacked apartment and calls his son. Buzz watches a basketball game he promised a girl he'd film, and a traumatized Issa sits alone on a ruined couch. Later that night, Ruiz meets Gwada for dinner and tells him a flash ball cannot be fired by accident. Gwada blames the children for overwhelming him. Ruiz decides to give Gwada the card, telling him, \"do what you gotta do.\" Gwada chooses not to release the video.\n\nThe next day, Issa tells his friends what happened to him, and they plan an assault. They destroy the squadron's car with a firework and trap them in a stairwell when they give chase. They destroy the mayor's office as well and club him when he protests. They also destroy the backup car Ruiz radios for. Chris is wounded when a bottle breaks on his face, and Ruiz pounds on the nearest door, begging for help. Issa lights a molotov cocktail and prepares to finish the squadron off with it. Ruiz tearfully begs Issa not to, pointing his gun at him. Buzz watches from behind the door, having chosen not to let the police in. As Issa decides whether to throw or not, the screen fades to black, and a quote from Victor Hugo' ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' comes up: \"Remember this, my friends: there are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Damien Bonnard]] as St\u00e9phane / Pento\n*[[Alexis Manenti]] as Chris \n*Djebril Zonga as Gwada\n*Issa Perica as Issa\n*Al-Hassan Ly as Buzz\n*Steve Tientcheu as The Mayor\n*Almamy Kanoute as Salah\n*[[Jeanne Balibar]] as The Commissioner\n*Raymond Lopez as Zorro\n*Omar Soumare as Macha\n*Sana Joachaim as Bintou\n*Lucas Omiri as Slim\n*Nazar Ben Fatma as La Pince\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn October 2018, it was announced [[Damien Bonnard]], Alexis Manenti and Djebril Zonga had joined the cast of the film, with Ladj Ly directing from a screenplay he wrote alongside Giordano Gederlini and Alexis Manenti.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ladj Ly\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables enters post-production |url=https://www.cineuropa.org/newsdetail/361048/ |website=Cineuropa |accessdate=18 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref> \n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on 15 May 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/press/press-articles/communique/articles/the-screenings-guide-2019|title=The Screenings Guide 2019|date=9 May 2019|accessdate=9 May 2019}}</ref> Shortly after, [[Amazon Studios]] acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/cannes-buzz-movie-les-miserables-sells-to-amazon-for-u-s-1202617224/|title=Cannes Buzz Movie \u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2019 Sells To Amazon For U.S.|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Andreas|last=Wiseman|date=17 May 2019|accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref> It also screened at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 10 September 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/toronto-film-festival-joker-ford-v-ferrari-hustlers-lineup-1203275868/|title=Toronto Film Festival: 'Joker,' 'Ford v Ferrari,' 'Hustlers' Among Big Premieres|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Brent|last=Lang|date=23 July 2019|accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref> It was released in France on 20 November 2019 by Le Pacte.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.le-pacte.com/france/prochainement/detail/les-miserables/|title=Les Mis\u00e9rables|website=Le Pacte|accessdate=18 November 2019}}</ref> It was released in the United States on 10 January 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/les-miserables-trailer-amazon-1202183737/|title=\u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2019 Trailer: Paris Is Burning in France\u2019s 2020 Oscar Entry|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Tambay|last=Obenson|date=23 October 2019|accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 51 reviews, with an average rating of 7.41/10.

Montfermeil is a suburb 25 kilometers northeast of [[Paris]] where, in [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 novel ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]'', former convict Jean Valjean meets Cosette, a girl abused by her adoptive parents. The film describes abuses against poor citizens, especially teenagers, of African or Arabic ethnicities, thus stressing the continuity in the fate of the poor in Montfermeil.  \n\nIt had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on 15 May 2019. It was released in France on 20 November 2019 by Le Pacte. It was selected as the French entry for the [[Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|Best International Feature Film]] at the [[92nd Academy Awards]]. It went on to win four [[45th C\u00e9sar Awards|C\u00e9sar Awards]], including [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Film|Best Film]], and other honours.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film begins with images of the crowd celebrating on [[Paris|Paris']] Avenue des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es the victory of the French team at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], which had been perceived, and celebrated in France as a moment of brotherhood between people of different social classes or ethnicities. \n\nPolice officer St\u00e9phane Ruiz moves to a Paris suburb to get a better chance at gaining custody of his son from his divorced wife and gets a job with the SCU's anti-crime brigade on duty in the nearby city of [[Montfermeil]]. St\u00e9phane Ruiz is assigned to work with brigadier Gwada and squad leader \"Pink Pig\" Chris. Chris often and aggressively abuses his power to frisk young girls, which reminds of Cosette's fate. Gwada is complacent with that abuse.\n\nCircus leader Zorro has a lion cub stolen from him by young slum kid Issa and confronts the slum's mayor about it. The squadron steps in and promises to find the cub and Zorro threatens to return with firearms if they do not find it. Chris finds Issa when he brags on Instagram about stealing the cub. They chase him down, but when Chris asks him where the cub is, he claims it ran away. Issa's friends surround the squadron and attempt to free him, and Gwada accidentally teargasses himself in the process. When a panicked Issa runs, a delirious Gwada shoots him in the face with a flash ball. Drone-obsessed teen Buzz catches the confrontation on video and plans to release it. Chris spots the drone, and the squadron sets out to locate it, taking a severely injured Issa with them.\n\nChris uses his local neighborhood contact to find Buzz and leaves Issa with them. Buzz is in the process of uploading his video when the squadron arrives. Buzz flees with the memory card while Gwada destroys his drone. Buzz takes shelter with restaurant owner Salah just as the squadron and the mayor arrived. After a tense confrontation in which Chris attempts to illegally arrest Buzz, Ruiz convinces Salah (whom he had met before) to give him the memory card. Chris' contact drops off Issa just as HQ radios in that the cub was spotted in a nearby park.\n\nThe squadron captures the cub and takes it back to Zorro, making Issa apologize. Zorro dangles Issa in front of a fully grown lion, scaring him into wetting himself. Deciding Issa has learned his lesson, Chris drops him off and warns him not to tell anyone what happened. Ruiz reveals he has the memory card and threatens to release it, which Chris angrily warns him against. A distraught Gwada goes home to his elderly mother, a seemingly unaffected Chris goes home to his family, and Ruiz goes home to his still unpacked apartment and calls his son. Buzz watches a basketball game he promised a girl he'd film, and a traumatized Issa sits alone on a ruined couch. Later that night, Ruiz meets Gwada for dinner and tells him a flash ball cannot be fired by accident. Gwada blames the children for overwhelming him. Ruiz decides to give Gwada the card, telling him, \"do what you gotta do.\" Gwada chooses not to release the video.\n\nThe next day, Issa tells his friends what happened to him, and they plan an assault. They destroy the squadron's car with a firework and trap them in a stairwell when they give chase. They destroy the mayor's office as well and club him when he protests. They also destroy the backup car Ruiz radios for. Chris is wounded when a bottle breaks on his face, and Ruiz pounds on the nearest door, begging for help. Issa lights a molotov cocktail and prepares to finish the squadron off with it. Ruiz tearfully begs Issa not to, pointing his gun at him. Buzz watches from behind the door, having chosen not to let the police in. As Issa decides whether to throw or not, the screen fades to black, and a quote from Victor Hugo' ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' comes up: \"Remember this, my friends: there are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Damien Bonnard]] as St\u00e9phane / Pento\n*[[Alexis Manenti]] as Chris \n*Djebril Zonga as Gwada\n*Issa Perica as Issa\n*Al-Hassan Ly as Buzz\n*Steve Tientcheu as The Mayor\n*Almamy Kanoute as Salah\n*[[Jeanne Balibar]] as The Commissioner\n*Raymond Lopez as Zorro\n*Omar Soumare as Macha\n*Sana Joachaim as Bintou\n*Lucas Omiri as Slim\n*Nazar Ben Fatma as La Pince\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIn October 2018, it was announced [[Damien Bonnard]], Alexis Manenti and Djebril Zonga had joined the cast of the film, with Ladj Ly directing from a screenplay he wrote alongside Giordano Gederlini and Alexis Manenti.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ladj Ly\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables enters post-production |url=https://www.cineuropa.org/newsdetail/361048/ |website=Cineuropa |accessdate=18 April 2019 |language=en}}</ref> \n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on 15 May 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.festival-cannes.com/en/press/press-articles/communique/articles/the-screenings-guide-2019|title=The Screenings Guide 2019|date=9 May 2019|accessdate=9 May 2019}}</ref> Shortly after, [[Amazon Studios]] acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/cannes-buzz-movie-les-miserables-sells-to-amazon-for-u-s-1202617224/|title=Cannes Buzz Movie \u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2019 Sells To Amazon For U.S.|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Andreas|last=Wiseman|date=17 May 2019|accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref> It also screened at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on 10 September 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/toronto-film-festival-joker-ford-v-ferrari-hustlers-lineup-1203275868/|title=Toronto Film Festival: 'Joker,' 'Ford v Ferrari,' 'Hustlers' Among Big Premieres|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Brent|last=Lang|date=23 July 2019|accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref> It was released in France on 20 November 2019 by Le Pacte.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.le-pacte.com/france/prochainement/detail/les-miserables/|title=Les Mis\u00e9rables|website=Le Pacte|accessdate=18 November 2019}}</ref> It was released in the United States on 10 January 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/les-miserables-trailer-amazon-1202183737/|title=\u2018Les Mis\u00e9rables\u2019 Trailer: Paris Is Burning in France\u2019s 2020 Oscar Entry|website=[[IndieWire]]|first=Tambay|last=Obenson|date=23 October 2019|accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 51 reviews, with an average rating of 7.41/10.
