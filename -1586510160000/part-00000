While the signs of the end of days are conflicting several strong themes come through, the most important being the final generations of vampires, shortage of blood due to over crowding of hunting grounds and the awakening of the [[Antediluvians (World of Darkness)|Antediluvian]]s, the most ancient of vampires.\n\nThe ''Book of Nod'' came with commentary by several Kindred scholars, including the [[Gangrel (World of Darkness)|Gangrel]] Aristotle deLaurent and his childe, Beckett.  Supposedly the book was not meant to be widely distributed, but was stolen by a competing scholar Aisha, who wished it available to all.\n\n== Noddism ==\nIn the World of Darkness studying and searching on the Book of Nod is known as Noddism, with the Scholars being called Noddists.  Officially the [[Camarilla (World of Darkness)|Camarilla]] denies the existence of the ancients, believing them long extinct, its [[Archon(World of Darkness)|Archon]]s hunting and destroying Noddist lore.  Unofficially many Camarilla elders fear and prepare for the coming armageddon.  In contrast, the [[Sabbat (World of Darkness)|Sabbat]] actively seeks Noddist lore in hopes of forestalling the return of the Antediluvians, viewing itself as an army set against them.\n\nA complete version of the book is unknown, though parts of it in various languages are known to exist.  Fragments are widely distributed and well protected, as the secrets they contain may provide clues to the origin and fate of the kindred.  Finding a complete version of the Book of Nod is comparable to finding the [[Rosetta Stone]] or the [[Holy Grail]].\n\n==Related works==\n* White Wolf released several books containing supposed scripture from the Book of Nod. ''[[The Erciyes Fragments]]'' was included for the ''[[Vampire: The Dark Ages]]'', along with a backstory detailing the Fragments' discovery and passing into the hands of the [[Giovanni (World of Darkness)|Giovanni]].\n* ''Revelations of the Dark Mother'' depicted the story of the first vampires from the point of view of [[Lilith (World of Darkness)|Lilith]], [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]'s first wife.<ref name=\"sfsite rev\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sfsite.com/05b/rev57.htm |title=Revelations of the Dark Mother |author=Bassingthwaite, Don |date=1999 |website=[[SF Site]] |access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> She was mentioned in the first book as the being who first awakened Caine to his true potential.\n*These books were produced with the intention that individual Storytellers could provide information from them to their players, as the stories required.\n* Several other ''Vampire: The Masquerade'' books contained passages of the Book of Nod.  These often conflicted with each other and Storytellers were encouraged to add to the chaos, simulating the problems the Noddist scholars must face.\n* The Book of Nod was allegedly the inspiration that led the Byzantine priest Procopius to write the ''Book of the Shining Blood'', the main scripture of the [[Cainite Heresy]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n*Justin Achilli, ''Vampire: The Masquerade (Revised Edition)'' (White Wolf Game Studio, 1998, {{ISBN|1-56504-249-2}})\n*[[Sam Chupp]] and Andrew Greenberg, ''The Book of Nod'' (White Wolf Game Studio, 1994, {{ISBN|1-56504-078-3}})\n*{{cite web\n | url=http://www.sfsite.com/05b/rev57.htm\n | title=The SF Site Featured Review: Revelations of the Dark Mother\n | last=Bassingthwaite\n | first=Don\n | publisher=SF Site\n | year = 1999\n | accessdate=2008-04-19}}\n*{{cite web\n | url=http://www.flamesrising.com/book-of-nod-fiction-review/\n | title=Book of Nod RPG Review\n | first=Monica \n | last=Valentinelli\n | publisher=FlamesRising.com\n | date=2004-09-29\n | accessdate=2008-04-19}}\n*{{cite journal\n | url=http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/login/article.html?id=795\n | title=Pyramid Pick: The Book of Nod\n | last=McCubbin\n | first=Chris\n | journal=[[Pyramid (magazine)|Pyramid]]\n | publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]\n | volume=#8\n | date=August 1994\n | accessdate=2008-04-19}}\n\n{{WoD vampire clans}}\n{{WoD vampire}}\n\n[[Category:Fictional books]]\n[[Category:Vampire: The Masquerade]]\n\n[[pt:Livro de Nod]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Book of Nod.jpg|thumb|The Book of Nod]]\nThe '''Book of Nod''' is a [[fiction]]al book in [[White Wolf Game Studio]]'s [[role-playing game|role-playing]] setting, [[World of Darkness]].

Unofficially many Camarilla elders fear and prepare for the coming armageddon.  In contrast, the [[Sabbat (World of Darkness)|Sabbat]] actively seeks Noddist lore in hopes of forestalling the return of the Antediluvians, viewing itself as an army set against them.  \n\nA complete version of the book is unknown, though parts of it in various languages are known to exist.  Fragments are widely distributed and well protected, as the secrets they contain may provide clues to the origin and fate of the kindred.  Finding a complete version of the Book of Nod is comparable to finding the [[Rosetta Stone]] or the [[Holy Grail]].\n\n==Related works==\n* White Wolf released several books containing supposed scripture from the Book of Nod.

The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the [[Soviet national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]]. When Canada's best players (from the [[National Hockey League]]) were able to compete starting in 1998, expectations were high for the country's return to glory, but the [[Czech national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]] won gold and the team fell to [[Finnish national men's ice hockey team|Finland]] in the bronze medal game.

The nation has traditionally done very well at the Olympic games, winning 6 of the first 7 gold medals. However, by 1956 its amateur club teams and national teams could not compete with the teams of government-supported players from the [[Soviet national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]]. When Canada's best players (from the [[National Hockey League]]) were able to compete starting in 1998, expectations were high for the country's return to glory, but the [[Czech national ice hockey team|Czech Republic]] won gold and the team fell to [[Finnish national men's ice hockey team|Finland]] in the bronze medal game.

Their debut eponymous album (''Here Comes The Kraken'') was released in 2009, which was accompanied with an extensive tour in Mexico and Europe. They then followed this up with an EP entitled ''The Omen'' in 2010.

It is located in [[Delft]], Netherlands. It is consistently ranked as the best university in the Netherlands. As of 2020, it is ranked by [[QS World University Rankings]] among the top 15 engineering and technology universities in the world.<ref name=\"TU Delft QS Engineering Ranking 2020\" />\n\nWith eight [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] and numerous [[research institutes]],<ref name=\"TU Delft Research Institutes\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/research/thematic-cooperation/42457/research-institutes-tu-delft-institutes/|title=Research institutes|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2019-01-02}}</ref> it has more than 19,000 students ([[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]]), and employs more than 2,900 scientists and 2,100 support and management staff.<ref name=\"Facts and Figures 2015\"/>\n\nThe university was established on 8 January 1842 by [[William II of the Netherlands]] as a Royal Academy, with the primary purpose of training [[civil servants]] for work in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The school expanded its research and education curriculum over time, becoming a polytechnic school in 1864 and an institute of technology (making it a full-fledged university) in 1905. It changed its name to Delft University of Technology in 1986.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nDutch [[Nobel laureates]] [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]], [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], and [[Simon van der Meer]] have been associated with TU Delft. TU Delft is a member of several university federations, including the [[IDEA League]], [[CESAER Association|CESAER]], [[UNITECH International]], and [[4TU]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Delft University of Technology}}\n\n===Royal Academy (1842\u20131864)===\n[[File:Jan Adam Kruseman William II King of the Netherlands 1840.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[William II of the Netherlands]], founder of Royal Academy in Delft.]]\nDelft University of Technology was founded on 8 January 1842 by [[William II of the Netherlands]] as ''Royal Academy for the education of civilian engineers, for serving both nation and industry, and of apprentices for trade''.<ref name=\"History\"/> One of the purposes of the academy was to educate [[civil servants]] for the colonies of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. The first director of the academy was Antoine Lipkens, constructor of the first Dutch [[optical telegraph]], called simply as Lipkens. Royal Academy had its first building located at Oude Delft 95 in Delft. On 23 May 1863 an Act was passed imposing regulations on technical education in the Netherlands, bringing it under the rules of [[secondary education]].\n\n===Polytechnic School (1864\u20131905)===\nOn 20 June 1864, Royal Academy in Delft was disbanded by a Royal Decree, giving a way to a ''Polytechnic School of Delft'' ({{lang|nl|Politechnische School van Delft}}). The newly formed school educated [[engineer]]s of various fields and architects, so much needed during the rapid [[Industrial revolution|industrialization period]] in the 19th century.\n\n===Institute of Technology (1905\u20131986)===\nYet another Act, passed on 22 May 1905, changed the name of the school to ''Technical College (Institute) of Delft'' ({{lang|nl|Technische Hoogeschool Delft}}, from 1934 {{lang|nl|Technische Hogeschool Delft}}), emphasizing the academic quality of the education. Polytechnic was granted university rights and was allowed to award academic degrees. The number of students reached 450 around that time. The official opening of the new school was attended by Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] on 10 July 1905. First [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the newly established College was [[Ing\u00e9nieur|ir.]] J. Kraus, [[hydraulic engineer]]. In 1905, the first doctoral degree was awarded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/alumni/inspiring-alumni/alumni-walk-of-fame/historical-alumni-lustrum-edition-2017/jacob-kraus/|title=Jacob Kraus|publisher=Delft University of Technology|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref> From 1924 until the construction of the new campus in 1966 the ceremonies were held in the [[Saint Hippolytus Chapel, Delft|Saint Hippolytus Chapel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historischgis.delft.nl/emap/gemeentedelft/data/monumenten/toeristisch/8.pdf |title=St.-Hippolytuskapel |publisher=Delft municipality |language=Dutch |accessdate=29 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809142610/http://historischgis.delft.nl/emap/gemeentedelft/data/monumenten/toeristisch/8.pdf |archivedate=9 August 2016 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[Legal personality|Corporate rights]] were granted to the College on 7 June 1956. Most of the university buildings during that time were located within Delft city centre, with some of the buildings set on the side of the river [[Schie]], in the Wippolder district.\n\nStudent organizations grew together with the university. The first to be established on 22 March 1848 is the ''Delftsch Studenten Corps'' housed in the distinctive ''Soci\u00ebteit Phoenix'' on the Phoenixstraat.  This was followed by the ''Delftsche Studenten Bond '' (est. 30 October 1897) and the ''[[Sanctus Virgilius|KSV Sanctus Virgilius]]'' (est. 2 March 1898). In 1917 ''Proof Garden for Technical Plantation'' ({{lang-nl|Cultuurtuin voor Technische Gewassen}}) was established by [[Gerrit van Iterson]], which today is known as Botanical Garden of TU Delft. In that period a first female professor, Toos Korvezee, was appointed.\n\n===Delft University of Technology (1986\u2013present)===\nAfter the end of World War II, TU Delft increased its rapid academic expansion. [[Studium Generale]] was established at all universities in the Netherlands, including TU Delft, to promote a free and accessible knowledge related to culture, technology, society and science. Because of the increasing number of students, in 1974 the first ''Reception Week for First Year Students'' ({{lang|nl|Ontvangst Week voor Eerstejaars Studenten}}, OWEE) was established, which became a TU Delft tradition since then.\n\n<div align=\"left|center|right|justify\">\nOn 1 September 1986, the Delft Institute of Technology officially changed its name to Delft University of Technology, underlining the quality of the education and research provided by the institution. In the course of further expansion, in 1987 Delft Top Tech<ref name=\"Top Tech\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.delft-toptech.nl/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020528151434/http://www.delft-toptech.nl/|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 May 2002|title=TU Delft Top Tech|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=6 August 2010}}</ref> institute was established, which provided a professional master education in management for people working in the technology-related companies. On 1 September 1997, the 13 faculties of the TU Delft were merged into 9, to improve the management efficiency of the growing university. In the early 1990s, because the vast majority of the students of the university were male, an initiative to increase the number of female students resulted in founding a separate [[emancipation]] commission. As a result, ''Girls Study Technology'' ({{lang|nl|Meiden studeren techniek}}) days were established. In later years the responsibilities of the commission were distributed over multiple institutes.\n</div>\nSince 2006 all buildings of the university are located outside of the historical city center of Delft. The relatively new building of [[Materials science|Material Sciences]] department was sold, later demolished in 2007 to give place for a newly built building of the [[Haagse Hogeschool]]. Closer cooperation between TU Delft and Dutch universities of applied sciences resulted in physical transition of some of the institutes from outside to Delft. In September 2009 many [[Vocational universities in The Netherlands#Universities of Applied Science|institutes of applied sciences]] from [[the Hague]] region as well as Institute of Applied Sciences in Rijswijk, transferred to Delft, close to the location of the university, at the square between Rotterdamseweg and Leeghwaterstraat.\n\nIn 2007 the three Dutch technical universities, TU Delft, [[TU Eindhoven]] and [[University of Twente]], established a [[federation]], called [[3TU]].\n\nOn 13 May 2008, the building of the [[TU Delft Faculty of Architecture|Faculty of Architecture]] was destroyed by fire, presumably caused by a short circuit in a coffee machine due to a ruptured water pipe. Luckily, the architecture library, containing several thousands of books and maps, as well as many architecture models, including chairs by [[Gerrit Rietveld]] and [[Le Corbusier]], were saved. The Faculty of Architecture is currently housed in the university's former main building.\n\n==Logo==\nThrough the course of the years the [[logo]] of the TU Delft changed a number of times, along with its official name. The current logo is based on the three university colors cyan, black and white.<ref name=\"TU Delft Colors\"/> The letter \"T\" bears a stylized flame on top, referring to the flame that [[Prometheus]] brought from [[Mount Olympus]] to the people, against the will of [[Zeus]]. Because of this, Prometheus is sometimes considered as the first engineer, and is an important symbol for the university. His statue stood in the center of the newly renovated TU Delft campus, Mekelpark, until it was stolen in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bonger|first1=Saskia|title=Bronzen beeld Prometheus gestolen|url=https://www.delta.tudelft.nl/article/bronzen-beeld-prometheus-gestolen|website=Delta|publisher=Delta|accessdate=20 January 2017|language=Dutch|date=30 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nInitially, all of the university buildings were located in the historic city centre of Delft. This changed in the second half of the 20th century with relocations to a separate university neighbourhood. The last university building in the historic centre of Delft was the university library, which was relocated to a new building in 1997. On the 12 September 2006 the design of the new university neighbourhood, Mekelpark, was officially approved,<ref name=\"Mekelpark\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mekelpark.tudelft.nl/|title=TU Delft Mekelpark|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=23 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200322/http://www.mekelpark.tudelft.nl/|archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref> giving a green light to the transformation of the area around the Mekelweg (the main road on the university terrain) into a new campus heart. The new park replaced the main access road and redirected car traffic around the campus, making the newly created park a safer place for bicycles and pedestrians.\n\n===Mekelpark===\n[[File:TU Delft Mekelpark.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Entrance to the Mekelpark, with the statue of [[Prometheus]], university's symbol.]]\nNew university neighborhood called Mekelpark (its name commemorating TH Delft professor and WW II resistance fighter, Jan Mekel, who was executed by the Nazis on 2 May 1942 in [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]]) was opened on 5 July 2009. Mekelpark replaced old parking structures, bike lanes and [[gas station]], constructed between faculty buildings of the university in the late 1950s. Its 832-meter-long promenade eased the commute between faculty buildings. Both sides of the promenade are covered by stone benches, 1547 meters long in total.<ref name=\"Mekelpark\" /> Some of the university buildings around the Mekelpark deserve certain attention.\n\n====Aula====\n\nTU Delft [[Atrium (architecture)|Aula]] was designed by Van den Broek en Bakema architecture bureau founded by two TU Delft alumni [[Jo van den Broek]] and [[Jaap Bakema]]. It was officially opened on 6 January 1966 by Dutch Prime Minister [[Jo Cals]]. It is a classical example of a structure built in [[Brutalism|Brutalist]] style. TU Delft Aula, which symbolically opens the Mekelpark, houses main university restaurant and store, as well as [[lecture halls]], [[auditoria]], congress center, and administrative offices of the university. All [[Doctorat#The Netherlands .2F Flanders|doctoral promotion]], [[honoris causa]] ceremonies, as well as [[academic senate]] meetings take place in the Aula.\n\n====Library====\n[[File:TU-Delft-Bibl-1.jpg|thumb|TU Delft Library]]\nThe TU Delft Library, constructed in 1997, was designed by Delft-based [[Mecanoo]] architecture bureau. It is located behind university [[atrium (architecture)|aula]]. The roof of the library is covered with grass, which serves as a natural insulation. The structure lifts from the ground on one side allowing to walk to the top of the building. The library is topped by the steel cone, giving its unique shape. All the walls are completely filled with glass. The library won the Dutch ''National Steel Prize'' in 1998 in the ''buildings of steel and hybrid constructions'' category. The library is also host of the 4TU.Centre for Research Data, the archive for research data in the technical sciences in the Netherlands.\n\n====Cultural and Sports Center====\nThe TU Delft Sports and Culture Center, recently renamed The X, is located at Mekelweg 10, at the edge of the Mekelpark. It was designed by architect Vera Yanovshtchinsky and opened to TU Delft students and staff in 1995. Since then it has undergone expansions and renovations.\n\n===TU Delft Musea===\nThree musea are associated with the university: Science Centre Delft,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/sciencecentre/|title=Science Centre Delft|publisher=TU Delft|language=Dutch|accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> Mineralogy-geology museum and [[Martinus Beijerinck|Beijerinck]] en [[Albert Kluyver|Kluyver]] archive.\n\nScience Centre Delft was opened in September 2010 and is located at Mijnbouwstraat 120 in Delft. Science Center Delft is a successor of Technical Exhibition Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tudelft.nl/live/pagina.jsp?id=3ce3ee59-95fc-4d69-9adc-fd837a03c746&lang=nl|title=History of Science Center Delft | language=Dutch |publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2010-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318001742/http://home.tudelft.nl/index.php?id=11699&L=0 |archive-date=2012-03-18 }}</ref> Technical Exhibition Center was established by a group of TU Delft professors with the aim of presenting the recent advances in technology to a wider audience. Parts of the collection were shown outside of Delft: in the Netherlands and abroad, including [[Israel]] and [[Czech Republic]]. The collection was permanently hosted in the building of former department of [[geodesy]]. The historical collections of Technical Exhibition Center were moved Delft Museum of Technology, located at Ezelsveldlaan, in the buildings of the former department of [[naval architecture]] ({{lang|nl|Werktuig- en Scheepsbouwkunde}}), next to the city center of Delft. As Delft city council together with TU Delft decided to move the collection close to the university campus (currently the building of the former museum are transformed into [[lofts]]), Science Centre Delft shows visitors current TU Delft research projects are available, including [[Eco-Runner Team Delft|Eco Runner]] and [[Nuna]].\n\n[[Martinus Beijerinck|Beijerinck]] en [[Albert Kluyver|Kluyver]] archive hosts a collection of documents, exhibits and memorabilia of two scientists historically connected with the university.\n\nMineralogy-geology museum is a part of TU Delft Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences and contains around 200,000 [[geological]], [[mineralogical]] and [[crystallography|crystallographical]] items divided into numerous sub-collections. The oldest items date back to 1842 when the TU Delft (then [[History of the Delft University of Technology#Royal Academy|Delft Royal Academy]]) was established.\n\n===Botanical garden===\nTU Delft [[botanical garden]] dates back to 1917, where ''Proof Garden for Technical Plantation'' ({{lang-nl|Cultuurtuin voor Technische Gewassen}}) was established by Gerrit van Iterson Jr., TU Delft graduate and assistant to [[Martinus Beijerinck]].<ref name=\"Botanical Garden History\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/botanicalgarden/the-garden/history/|title=History \u2013 Botanical Garden|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> Gerrit van Iterson Jr. was the first director of the garden until 1948. Creation of botanical gardens at TU Delft was partially a result of the increasing needs of systematized development of [[tropical agriculture]] in then Dutch colony of [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name=\"Botanical Garden History\" /> Over 7000 different species of plants, including [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] plants, [[herb]]s, and [[ornamental plant]]s cover the area of almost 2.5 ha.<ref name=\"Botanical Garden History\" /> Furthermore, more than 2000 unique species are preserved in university's [[greenhouse]]s. All facilities of TU Delft botanical garden are open to the public.\n\n{{Commons category|Botanical garden T.U.Delft}}\n\n==Faculties==\nTU Delft comprises eight faculties.<ref name=\"Faculties\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/faculties/|title=Faculties|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> These are (official Dutch name and faculty abbreviation are given in brackets): \n* Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering (3mE) ({{lang|nl|Werktuigbouwkunde, Maritieme Techniek & Technische Materiaalwetenschappen (3mE)}}), \n* [[TU Delft Faculty of Architecture|Architecture and the Built Environment]] ({{lang|nl|Bouwkunde (BK)}}), \n* Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG) ({{lang|nl|Civiele Techniek en Geowetenschappen (CiTG)}}), \n* Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) ({{lang|nl|Elektrotechniek, Wiskunde en Informatica (EWI)}}), \n* [[TU Delft Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering|Industrial Design Engineering]] (IDE) ({{lang|nl|Industrieel Ontwerpen (IO)}}), \n* [[TU Delft Faculty of Aerospace Engineering|Aerospace Engineering]] (AE) ({{lang|nl|Luchtvaart- en Ruimtevaarttechniek (LR)}}), \n* [[TU Delft Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management|Technology, Policy and Management]] (TPM) ({{lang|nl|Techniek, Bestuur en Management (TBM)}}),\n* Applied Sciences (AS) ({{lang|nl|Technische Natuurwetenschappen (TNW)}}).\n\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"8\">\nFile:TU Delft Geoscience.jpg|Civil Engineering and Geosciences\nFile:Applied Sciences TU Delft.jpg|Applied Sciences\nFile:ID building.jpg|TU Delft Faculty of [[TU Delft Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering|Industrial Design Engineering]]\nFile:Delft - TU-gebouw van werktuigbouw.jpg|Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering\nFile:Delft - Universiteitsgebouw (Rode Scheikunde).jpg|TU Delft Faculty of [[TU Delft Faculty of Architecture|Architecture and the Built Environment]]\nFile:Faculty of Aerospace Engineering.jpg|TU Delft Faculty of [[Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technology|Aerospace Engineering]]\nFile:Faculty EEMCS.JPG|Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science\nFile:TU Delft Faculteit Techniek, Bestuur en Management.jpg|[[TU Delft Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management|Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n[[File:EWI TUDelft.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science viewed from the Civil Engineering department.]]\n\n==Education==\nSince 2004, the TU Delft education system is divided into three tiers: the [[Bachelor's degree]], [[Master's degree]], and [[Doctorate]]. The academic year is divided into two semesters: the first semester from September until January and the second semester from the end of January until July. Most of the lectures are available through [[OpenCourseWare]].\n\n===Bachelor-level studies===\nAs of 2016 TU Delft offers 16 [[BSc]] programmes.<ref name=\"TU Delft BSc\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/bachelors/|title=Bachelors |website=TU Delft |publisher=TU Delft |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> TU Delft students obtain their degree after a three-year study. The test project finalizes the BSc studies. All BSc programmes are taught in Dutch, except for [[Aerospace Engineering]], Applied Earth Sciences programmes, Electrical Engineering, Nanobiology, and Computer Science, which are taught entirely in English.\n\n===Master-level studies===\nTU Delft offers around 40 [[MSc]] programmes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/ |title=Masters |website=TU Delft |publisher=TU Delft |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> The MSc studies take two years to complete.\n\nTU Delft uses the [[European Credit Transfer System]], where each year MSc students are required to obtain 60 ECTS points. An honours track exists for motivated MSc students, who obtained a mark of 7.5 or higher (in [[Academic grading in the Netherlands|Dutch grading scale]]) and did not fail any courses. This track, associated with 30 ECTS points, is taken alongside the regular MSc programme and must be related to student's regular degree courses or the role of [[Technology and society|technology in society]]. The honours track must be completed within the time allowed for the MSc programme.\n\nMSc programmes are also offered through the [[3TU]] federation, [[Erasmus Mundus]] programmes, [[IDEA League]] joint MSc programs and [http://qutech.nl/edu/ QuTech Academy].\n\n===Doctoral-level studies===\n\n[[File:TU Delft PhD Defense committee.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Typical photo following a [[Doctoral studies|doctoral defense]] at Delft University of Technology.

The red tube holds the doctoral diploma. The [[List of academic ranks#Netherlands|promovendus]], as well as the paranymphs must wear white ties, while all professors in the defense committee wear [[toga]]s.]]\n[[Doctoral studies]] at TU Delft are divided into two phases. The first phase, lasting one year, serves as a trial period during which the doctoral candidate must prove capability for performing research on a doctoral level. The candidate must pass the evaluation performed at the end of the year by his/her promoter in order to continue doing research the following three years. The research the candidate performs must be finalized by submitting a [[doctoral thesis]]. The thesis is evaluated by a doctoral committee composed of TU Delft professors and external opponents. Once the thesis has been revised and comments have been taken into account, the candidate gives a formal doctoral defense.\n\nIn contrast to US graduate school, other duties such as following lectures and giving TAs form only a small portion of the programme.\n\n====Doctoral defense====\n\nThe [[Doctoral studies|doctoral defense]] is of ceremonial nature and is held in the senate room. It lasts exactly one hour, during which the doctoral candidate must answer all questions from the committee. Sometimes the candidate is accompanied by one or two [[paranymph]]s, who theoretically might help defend a question asked by a committee member. The defense is ended by the [[Bedel|pedel]], who enters the room and says in Latin ''Hora est'' (''It is time''), stamping the university [[Staff of office|staff]] on the floor. The committee then moves to a separate room to decide whether to grant the candidate a doctorate or not. Then the committee returns to the room where the defense was held, and if the doctorate is granted the promoter presents the [[praise|laudation]] praising the new [[doctor (title)|doctor]]. The entire ceremony is chaired by the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] or a representative.\n\n===Other degree programmes===\n\nTU Delft also offers [[Professional Doctorate in Engineering]].\n\n==Organization==\n\n===Research Institutes===\nTU Delft has three officially recognized [[research institutes]]: Research Institute for the Built Environment,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/architecture-and-the-built-environment/about-the-faculty/departments/otb-research-for-the-built-environment/|title=OTB \u2013 Research for the built environment|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> International Research Centre for Telecommunications-transmission and Radar,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irctr.tudelft.nl/|title=IRCTR Institute TU Delft|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> and [[Reactor Institute Delft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/business/facilities/reactor-institute-delft/|title=Reactor Instituut|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref> In addition to those three institutes, TU Delft hosts numerous smaller research institutes, including the Delft Institute of Microelectronics and Submicron Technology,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/onderzoek/faciliteiten/else-kooi-lab/|title=Else Kooi Lab|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2017-07-01}}</ref> [[Kavli Institute of Nanoscience]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kavli.tudelft.nl/|title=Kavli Institute of Nanoscience|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2019-01-02}}</ref> Materials innovation institute,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.m2i.nl/|title=Materials innovation institute (M2i)|publisher=M2i|accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> Astrodynamics and Space Missions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae/organisation/departments/space-engineering/astrodynamics-and-space-missions/ |title=Astrodynamics and Space Missions |publisher=TU Delft |accessdate=2018-02-28 }}</ref> Delft University Wind Energy Research Institute,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/duwind/|title=Delft University Wind Energy Research Institute|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2019-01-02}}</ref>\nTU Delft Safety and Security Institute,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tu-delft-safety-security-institute-dsys/|title=TU Delft Safety and Security Institute|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-06-25}}</ref> and the Delft Space Institute,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spaceinstitute.tudelft.nl|title=Delft Space Institute|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2017-02-10}}</ref> Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics is also an important research institute which connects all engineering departments with respect to research and academia. A complete list of research schools is available on TU Delft website.<ref name=\"TU Delft Research Institutes\"/>\n\n===Research schools===\nImportant part of [[Dutch universities|Dutch university system]] are research schools. They combine education, training and research for PhD candidates and [[postdoc|postdoctoral researchers]] in a given field. The main goal of the research schools is to coordinate nationwide research programs in a given area. Research schools of TU Delft cooperate with other universities in the Netherlands. Research schools are required to have an [[accreditation]] of [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. TU Delft is taking the lead in ten research schools, and participates in nine. The full list of research schools affiliated with TU Delft is available on TU Delft website,<ref name=\"TU Delft Research Institutes\"/> see for example [[TRAIL Research School]].\n\n===Media===\nDuring an [[academic year]] the TU Delft publishes a weekly magazine: ''Delta'',<ref name=\"TU Delta\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.delta.tudelft.nl/|title=Delta|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> which aims at the student and employee community of the university. The newspaper is predominantly in Dutch, with the last few pages published in English. ''TU Delta'' is distributed freely in paper form over the campus and is also available for free on the Internet. Articles focus mainly on current university affairs and student life. The weekly agenda including PhD promotions, inaugural lectures, etc. is also published therein.\n\nAlso, approximately four times a year, the TU Delft publishes a magazine devoted only to research conducted by the university, called ''Delft Outlook''.<ref name=\"Delft Outlook\">{{Cite web|url=http://delftoutlook.tudelft.nl/|title=Delft Outlook|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215164027/http://delftoutlook.tudelft.nl/|archive-date=2018-02-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Delft Outlook'' is published in English, while the same content is published in Dutch in ''[[Delft Integraal]]'' magazine. Both magazines present interviews with TU Delft researchers, university officials. [[Column (periodical)|Columns]] by some university professors are published therein, as well as alumni letters and excerpts from recently published PhD theses.\n\n===Management===\n{{main|List of rectores magnifici of the Delft University of Technology}}\nTU Delft is governed by the [[executive board]] ({{lang|nl|College van Bestuur}}),<ref name=\"Executive Board\"/> controlled and advised by [[student council]], [[workers council]], board of professors, board of doctorates, assistant staff office, committee for the application of the allocation model, operational committee, advisory council for quality and accreditation, [[Dean (education)|dean]]s of each TU Delft [[Faculty (division)|faculty]], and directors of TU Delft [[research center]]s, research schools and [[research institutes]].<ref name=\"TU Delft Research Schools\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/research/thematic-cooperation/research-schools/|title=Research Schools|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626033220/https://www.tudelft.nl/en/research/thematic-cooperation/research-schools/|archive-date=2018-06-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nExecutive board is chaired academically by the [[Rector (academia)|Rector Magnificus]].

Previous Rectors of TU Delft include Prof. K.F. Wakker (1993\u20131997 and 1998\u20132002), Prof. J. Blauwendraad (1997\u20131998) and Prof. J.T. Fokkema (2002\u20132010). Executive board is accountable to the [[Supervisory Board]], appointed by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (Netherlands)|Minister of Education, Culture and Science]]. One of the many tasks of executive board is the approval of management regulations.\n\nBoard of professors advises in the matter of academic quality, deciding on the selection of guest lecturers, [[research fellows]] as well as revising proposals submitted for royal honors for professors. Board of doctorates appoints supervisors for [[PhD]] students, forms promotion committees, determines promotional code, and confers PhD and doctorate [[Honoris Causa]] degrees. Committee for the application of the allocation model reports to the executive board regarding allocation model. Further, it controls output data supplied to the executive board. Operational committee is composed of members of the executive board and the [[dean (education)|s]]. The committee collaborates on the issues of general importance, related in part to the specific interests of the faculties, and strengthens the unity of the university overall.\n\n==Student life==\nStudent life at TU Delft is organized around numerous [[student societies]] and [[Corporation (university)|corporations]]. They can be generally categorized into [[Professional society|professional societies]], social societies and sport societies. More than half of TU Delft students belong to an officially recognized society{{Ref}}.\n[[File:Koornbeurs delft.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Building of the [[Koornbeurs Society]] in the old town of Delft.]]\n\nThere are two student parties at TU Delft: ORAS<ref name=\"ORAS\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oras.nl|title=ORAS Student Party Website|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> ({{lang|nl|Organisatie Rationele Studenten}}) and AAG<ref name=\"AAG\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aag.tudelft.nl|title=AAG Student Party Website|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> ({{lang|nl|Afdelings Actie Groepen}}). AAG started as an action group of students in the 1960s, willing to have more impact on the quality of education at then Polytechnic Institute Delft. ORAS became active in the early 1970s as a counterbalance to AAG. Currently those two parties are competing each year for seats in TU Delft's Students Council ({{lang|nl|Studenten Raad}}). Further, all student organizations of TU Delft are associated with The Council of Student Societies Delft VeRa ({{lang|nl|De VerenigingsRaad}}) and The Society for Study and Student Matters Delft VSSD ({{lang|nl|Vereniging voor Studie- en Studentenbelangen Delft}}).\n\nApart from [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor]] and [[Master's student|master]] student organizations, [[PhD]] students of TU Delft have their own organization called Promood (PhD Students Discussion Group Delft) ({{lang|nl|Promovendi Overleg Delft}}), which represents TU Delft PhD students at the university. It is also a member of Dutch PhD Students Network ({{lang|nl|Promovendi Netwerk Nederland}}).\n\nEach faculty of TU Delft has its own set of professional student organizations. Numerous societies are present at the university,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/practical-matters/study-associations-student-associations/|title=Study associations & student associations|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> many of them with rich traditions, customs and history. For example, [[Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technology|aerospace engineering]] department hosts [[SSVOBB|Foundation for Students in Airplane Development, Manufacturing and Management]] ({{lang|nl|Stichting Studenten Vliegtuigontwikkeling, -bouw en -beheer}}), while [[civil engineering]] department [[Het Gezelschap \"Practische Studie\"|Society for Practical Studies]]. International professional student organizations are also present at TU Delft, including [[EUROAVIA|European Association of Aerospace Students]].\n\nApart from professional student societies, students organize themselves only for the purpose of enriching their social life. Many of the societies have sectarian roots, like a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Menschen Vereeniging Wolbodo|Wolbodo Student Society]], [[Katholieke Studentenvereniging Sanctus Virgilius Delft]], that during the course of the years lost the religious affiliations and accepts students from any denomination.  Besides societies which have their roots in religion, there are also general (with no religious bonds) societies. One of these is [[Sint Jansbrug]]. These societies accept anyone who studies at the TU Delft or any other higher education facility in the Delft area. Also organization that has its roots in [[Rover Scout]] movement [[Delftsche Zwervers]] (at the same time the oldest student scouting group in the world) is present or local branch of the European [[AEGEE]].\n\n{{Main|List of the Sport Student Societies at Delft University of Technology}}\nStudent sports are organized around clubs, that focus mostly on single discipline. Those include rowing society [[D.S.R.V. Laga|Laga]] and rowing club [[Proteus-eretes|Proteus-Eretes]] (both with many [[Olympic medals]] won by the members of the club) or [[American football]] club [[Delft Dragons]].\n\n==Research==\n[[File:Nuna 5.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Nuna 5]], from a series of [[Nuna]] [[solar-powered]] cars that won the [[World Solar Challenge]] seven times, constructed by the students of TU Delft.]]\n[[File:DUT12.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[DUT12]], the twelfth car of the [[Formula Student]] team Delft ([[DUT Racing]]).

It is located in [[Delft]], Netherlands. It is consistently ranked as the best university in Netherlands. As of 2020, it is ranked by [[QS World University Rankings]] among the top 15 engineering and technology universities in the world.<ref name=\"TU Delft QS Engineering Ranking 2020\" />\n\nWith eight [[Faculty (division)|faculties]] and numerous [[research institutes]],<ref name=\"TU Delft Research Institutes\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/research/thematic-cooperation/42457/research-institutes-tu-delft-institutes/|title=Research institutes|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2019-01-02}}</ref> it has more than 19,000 students ([[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate]]), and employs more than 2,900 scientists and 2,100 support and management staff.<ref name=\"Facts and Figures 2015\"/>\n\nThe university was established on 8 January 1842 by [[William II of the Netherlands]] as a Royal Academy, with the primary purpose of training [[civil servants]] for work in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The school expanded its research and education curriculum over time, becoming a polytechnic school in 1864 and an institute of technology (making it a full-fledged university) in 1905. It changed its name to Delft University of Technology in 1986.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nDutch [[Nobel laureates]] [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]], [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], and [[Simon van der Meer]] have been associated with TU Delft. TU Delft is a member of several university federations, including the [[IDEA League]], [[CESAER Association|CESAER]], [[UNITECH International]], and [[4TU]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Delft University of Technology}}\n\n===Royal Academy (1842\u20131864)===\n[[File:Jan Adam Kruseman William II King of the Netherlands 1840.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[William II of the Netherlands]], founder of Royal Academy in Delft.]]\nDelft University of Technology was founded on 8 January 1842 by [[William II of the Netherlands]] as ''Royal Academy for the education of civilian engineers, for serving both nation and industry, and of apprentices for trade''.<ref name=\"History\"/> One of the purposes of the academy was to educate [[civil servants]] for the colonies of the [[Dutch East India Company]]. The first director of the academy was Antoine Lipkens, constructor of the first Dutch [[optical telegraph]], called simply as Lipkens. Royal Academy had its first building located at Oude Delft 95 in Delft. On 23 May 1863 an Act was passed imposing regulations on technical education in the Netherlands, bringing it under the rules of [[secondary education]].\n\n===Polytechnic School (1864\u20131905)===\nOn 20 June 1864, Royal Academy in Delft was disbanded by a Royal Decree, giving a way to a ''Polytechnic School of Delft'' ({{lang|nl|Politechnische School van Delft}}). The newly formed school educated [[engineer]]s of various fields and architects, so much needed during the rapid [[Industrial revolution|industrialization period]] in the 19th century.\n\n===Institute of Technology (1905\u20131986)===\nYet another Act, passed on 22 May 1905, changed the name of the school to ''Technical College (Institute) of Delft'' ({{lang|nl|Technische Hoogeschool Delft}}, from 1934 {{lang|nl|Technische Hogeschool Delft}}), emphasizing the academic quality of the education. Polytechnic was granted university rights and was allowed to award academic degrees. The number of students reached 450 around that time. The official opening of the new school was attended by Queen [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] on 10 July 1905. First [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the newly established College was [[Ing\u00e9nieur|ir.]] J. Kraus, [[hydraulic engineer]]. In 1905, the first doctoral degree was awarded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/alumni/inspiring-alumni/alumni-walk-of-fame/historical-alumni-lustrum-edition-2017/jacob-kraus/|title=Jacob Kraus|publisher=Delft University of Technology|accessdate=28 February 2018}}</ref> From 1924 until the construction of the new campus in 1966 the ceremonies were held in the [[Saint Hippolytus Chapel, Delft|Saint Hippolytus Chapel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historischgis.delft.nl/emap/gemeentedelft/data/monumenten/toeristisch/8.pdf |title=St.-Hippolytuskapel |publisher=Delft municipality |language=Dutch |accessdate=29 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809142610/http://historischgis.delft.nl/emap/gemeentedelft/data/monumenten/toeristisch/8.pdf |archivedate=9 August 2016 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[Legal personality|Corporate rights]] were granted to the College on 7 June 1956. Most of the university buildings during that time were located within Delft city centre, with some of the buildings set on the side of the river [[Schie]], in the Wippolder district.\n\nStudent organizations grew together with the university. The first to be established on 22 March 1848 is the ''Delftsch Studenten Corps'' housed in the distinctive ''Soci\u00ebteit Phoenix'' on the Phoenixstraat.  This was followed by the ''Delftsche Studenten Bond '' (est. 30 October 1897) and the ''[[Sanctus Virgilius|KSV Sanctus Virgilius]]'' (est. 2 March 1898). In 1917 ''Proof Garden for Technical Plantation'' ({{lang-nl|Cultuurtuin voor Technische Gewassen}}) was established by [[Gerrit van Iterson]], which today is known as Botanical Garden of TU Delft. In that period a first female professor, Toos Korvezee, was appointed.\n\n===Delft University of Technology (1986\u2013present)===\nAfter the end of World War II, TU Delft increased its rapid academic expansion. [[Studium Generale]] was established at all universities in the Netherlands, including TU Delft, to promote a free and accessible knowledge related to culture, technology, society and science. Because of the increasing number of students, in 1974 the first ''Reception Week for First Year Students'' ({{lang|nl|Ontvangst Week voor Eerstejaars Studenten}}, OWEE) was established, which became a TU Delft tradition since then.\n\n<div align=\"left|center|right|justify\">\nOn 1 September 1986, the Delft Institute of Technology officially changed its name to Delft University of Technology, underlining the quality of the education and research provided by the institution. In the course of further expansion, in 1987 Delft Top Tech<ref name=\"Top Tech\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.delft-toptech.nl/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020528151434/http://www.delft-toptech.nl/|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 May 2002|title=TU Delft Top Tech|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=6 August 2010}}</ref> institute was established, which provided a professional master education in management for people working in the technology-related companies. On 1 September 1997, the 13 faculties of the TU Delft were merged into 9, to improve the management efficiency of the growing university. In the early 1990s, because the vast majority of the students of the university were male, an initiative to increase the number of female students resulted in founding a separate [[emancipation]] commission. As a result, ''Girls Study Technology'' ({{lang|nl|Meiden studeren techniek}}) days were established. In later years the responsibilities of the commission were distributed over multiple institutes.\n</div>\nSince 2006 all buildings of the university are located outside of the historical city center of Delft. The relatively new building of [[Materials science|Material Sciences]] department was sold, later demolished in 2007 to give place for a newly built building of the [[Haagse Hogeschool]]. Closer cooperation between TU Delft and Dutch universities of applied sciences resulted in physical transition of some of the institutes from outside to Delft. In September 2009 many [[Vocational universities in The Netherlands#Universities of Applied Science|institutes of applied sciences]] from [[the Hague]] region as well as Institute of Applied Sciences in Rijswijk, transferred to Delft, close to the location of the university, at the square between Rotterdamseweg and Leeghwaterstraat.\n\nIn 2007 the three Dutch technical universities, TU Delft, [[TU Eindhoven]] and [[University of Twente]], established a [[federation]], called [[3TU]].\n\nOn 13 May 2008, the building of the [[TU Delft Faculty of Architecture|Faculty of Architecture]] was destroyed by fire, presumably caused by a short circuit in a coffee machine due to a ruptured water pipe. Luckily, the architecture library, containing several thousands of books and maps, as well as many architecture models, including chairs by [[Gerrit Rietveld]] and [[Le Corbusier]], were saved. The Faculty of Architecture is currently housed in the university's former main building.\n\n==Logo==\nThrough the course of the years the [[logo]] of the TU Delft changed a number of times, along with its official name. The current logo is based on the three university colors cyan, black and white.<ref name=\"TU Delft Colors\"/> The letter \"T\" bears a stylized flame on top, referring to the flame that [[Prometheus]] brought from [[Mount Olympus]] to the people, against the will of [[Zeus]]. Because of this, Prometheus is sometimes considered as the first engineer, and is an important symbol for the university. His statue stood in the center of the newly renovated TU Delft campus, Mekelpark, until it was stolen in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bonger|first1=Saskia|title=Bronzen beeld Prometheus gestolen|url=https://www.delta.tudelft.nl/article/bronzen-beeld-prometheus-gestolen|website=Delta|publisher=Delta|accessdate=20 January 2017|language=Dutch|date=30 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nInitially, all of the university buildings were located in the historic city centre of Delft. This changed in the second half of the 20th century with relocations to a separate university neighbourhood. The last university building in the historic centre of Delft was the university library, which was relocated to a new building in 1997. On the 12 September 2006 the design of the new university neighbourhood, Mekelpark, was officially approved,<ref name=\"Mekelpark\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mekelpark.tudelft.nl/|title=TU Delft Mekelpark|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=23 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303200322/http://www.mekelpark.tudelft.nl/|archive-date=3 March 2016}}</ref> giving a green light to the transformation of the area around the Mekelweg (the main road on the university terrain) into a new campus heart. The new park replaced the main access road and redirected car traffic around the campus, making the newly created park a safer place for bicycles and pedestrians.\n\n===Mekelpark===\n[[File:TU Delft Mekelpark.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Entrance to the Mekelpark, with the statue of [[Prometheus]], university's symbol.]]\nNew university neighborhood called Mekelpark (its name commemorating TH Delft professor and WW II resistance fighter, Jan Mekel, who was executed by the Nazis on 2 May 1942 in [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]]) was opened on 5 July 2009. Mekelpark replaced old parking structures, bike lanes and [[gas station]], constructed between faculty buildings of the university in the late 1950s. Its 832-meter-long promenade eased the commute between faculty buildings. Both sides of the promenade are covered by stone benches, 1547 meters long in total.<ref name=\"Mekelpark\" /> Some of the university buildings around the Mekelpark deserve certain attention.\n\n====Aula====\n\nTU Delft [[Atrium (architecture)|Aula]] was designed by Van den Broek en Bakema architecture bureau founded by two TU Delft alumni [[Jo van den Broek]] and [[Jaap Bakema]]. It was officially opened on 6 January 1966 by Dutch Prime Minister [[Jo Cals]]. It is a classical example of a structure built in [[Brutalism|Brutalist]] style. TU Delft Aula, which symbolically opens the Mekelpark, houses main university restaurant and store, as well as [[lecture halls]], [[auditoria]], congress center, and administrative offices of the university. All [[Doctorat#The Netherlands .2F Flanders|doctoral promotion]], [[honoris causa]] ceremonies, as well as [[academic senate]] meetings take place in the Aula.\n\n====Library====\n[[File:TU-Delft-Bibl-1.jpg|thumb|TU Delft Library]]\nThe TU Delft Library, constructed in 1997, was designed by Delft-based [[Mecanoo]] architecture bureau. It is located behind university [[atrium (architecture)|aula]]. The roof of the library is covered with grass, which serves as a natural insulation. The structure lifts from the ground on one side allowing to walk to the top of the building. The library is topped by the steel cone, giving its unique shape. All the walls are completely filled with glass. The library won the Dutch ''National Steel Prize'' in 1998 in the ''buildings of steel and hybrid constructions'' category. The library is also host of the 4TU.Centre for Research Data, the archive for research data in the technical sciences in the Netherlands.\n\n====Cultural and Sports Center====\nThe TU Delft Sports and Culture Center, recently renamed The X, is located at Mekelweg 10, at the edge of the Mekelpark. It was designed by architect Vera Yanovshtchinsky and opened to TU Delft students and staff in 1995. Since then it has undergone expansions and renovations.\n\n===TU Delft Musea===\nThree musea are associated with the university: Science Centre Delft,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/sciencecentre/|title=Science Centre Delft|publisher=TU Delft|language=Dutch|accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> Mineralogy-geology museum and [[Martinus Beijerinck|Beijerinck]] en [[Albert Kluyver|Kluyver]] archive.\n\nScience Centre Delft was opened in September 2010 and is located at Mijnbouwstraat 120 in Delft. Science Center Delft is a successor of Technical Exhibition Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tudelft.nl/live/pagina.jsp?id=3ce3ee59-95fc-4d69-9adc-fd837a03c746&lang=nl|title=History of Science Center Delft | language=Dutch |publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2010-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318001742/http://home.tudelft.nl/index.php?id=11699&L=0 |archive-date=2012-03-18 }}</ref> Technical Exhibition Center was established by a group of TU Delft professors with the aim of presenting the recent advances in technology to a wider audience. Parts of the collection were shown outside of Delft: in the Netherlands and abroad, including [[Israel]] and [[Czech Republic]]. The collection was permanently hosted in the building of former department of [[geodesy]]. The historical collections of Technical Exhibition Center were moved Delft Museum of Technology, located at Ezelsveldlaan, in the buildings of the former department of [[naval architecture]] ({{lang|nl|Werktuig- en Scheepsbouwkunde}}), next to the city center of Delft. As Delft city council together with TU Delft decided to move the collection close to the university campus (currently the building of the former museum are transformed into [[lofts]]), Science Centre Delft shows visitors current TU Delft research projects are available, including [[Eco-Runner Team Delft|Eco Runner]] and [[Nuna]].\n\n[[Martinus Beijerinck|Beijerinck]] en [[Albert Kluyver|Kluyver]] archive hosts a collection of documents, exhibits and memorabilia of two scientists historically connected with the university.\n\nMineralogy-geology museum is a part of TU Delft Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences and contains around 200,000 [[geological]], [[mineralogical]] and [[crystallography|crystallographical]] items divided into numerous sub-collections. The oldest items date back to 1842 when the TU Delft (then [[History of the Delft University of Technology#Royal Academy|Delft Royal Academy]]) was established.\n\n===Botanical garden===\nTU Delft [[botanical garden]] dates back to 1917, where ''Proof Garden for Technical Plantation'' ({{lang-nl|Cultuurtuin voor Technische Gewassen}}) was established by Gerrit van Iterson Jr., TU Delft graduate and assistant to [[Martinus Beijerinck]].<ref name=\"Botanical Garden History\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/botanicalgarden/the-garden/history/|title=History \u2013 Botanical Garden|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> Gerrit van Iterson Jr. was the first director of the garden until 1948. Creation of botanical gardens at TU Delft was partially a result of the increasing needs of systematized development of [[tropical agriculture]] in then Dutch colony of [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name=\"Botanical Garden History\" /> Over 7000 different species of plants, including [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] plants, [[herb]]s, and [[ornamental plant]]s cover the area of almost 2.5 ha.<ref name=\"Botanical Garden History\" /> Furthermore, more than 2000 unique species are preserved in university's [[greenhouse]]s. All facilities of TU Delft botanical garden are open to the public.\n\n{{Commons category|Botanical garden T.U.Delft}}\n\n==Faculties==\nTU Delft comprises eight faculties.<ref name=\"Faculties\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/faculties/|title=Faculties|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> These are (official Dutch name and faculty abbreviation are given in brackets): \n* Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering (3mE) ({{lang|nl|Werktuigbouwkunde, Maritieme Techniek & Technische Materiaalwetenschappen (3mE)}}), \n* [[TU Delft Faculty of Architecture|Architecture and the Built Environment]] ({{lang|nl|Bouwkunde (BK)}}), \n* Civil Engineering and Geosciences (CEG) ({{lang|nl|Civiele Techniek en Geowetenschappen (CiTG)}}), \n* Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) ({{lang|nl|Elektrotechniek, Wiskunde en Informatica (EWI)}}), \n* [[TU Delft Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering|Industrial Design Engineering]] (IDE) ({{lang|nl|Industrieel Ontwerpen (IO)}}), \n* [[TU Delft Faculty of Aerospace Engineering|Aerospace Engineering]] (AE) ({{lang|nl|Luchtvaart- en Ruimtevaarttechniek (LR)}}), \n* [[TU Delft Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management|Technology, Policy and Management]] (TPM) ({{lang|nl|Techniek, Bestuur en Management (TBM)}}),\n* Applied Sciences (AS) ({{lang|nl|Technische Natuurwetenschappen (TNW)}}).\n\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"120px\" perrow=\"8\">\nFile:TU Delft Geoscience.jpg|Civil Engineering and Geosciences\nFile:Applied Sciences TU Delft.jpg|Applied Sciences\nFile:ID building.jpg|TU Delft Faculty of [[TU Delft Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering|Industrial Design Engineering]]\nFile:Delft - TU-gebouw van werktuigbouw.jpg|Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering\nFile:Delft - Universiteitsgebouw (Rode Scheikunde).jpg|TU Delft Faculty of [[TU Delft Faculty of Architecture|Architecture and the Built Environment]]\nFile:Faculty of Aerospace Engineering.jpg|TU Delft Faculty of [[Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technology|Aerospace Engineering]]\nFile:Faculty EEMCS.JPG|Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science\nFile:TU Delft Faculteit Techniek, Bestuur en Management.jpg|[[TU Delft Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management|Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management]]\n</gallery>\n</center>\n[[File:EWI TUDelft.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science viewed from the Civil Engineering department.]]\n\n==Education==\nSince 2004, the TU Delft education system is divided into three tiers: the [[Bachelor's degree]], [[Master's degree]], and [[Doctorate]]. The academic year is divided into two semesters: the first semester from September until January and the second semester from the end of January until July. Most of the lectures are available through [[OpenCourseWare]].\n\n===Bachelor-level studies===\nAs of 2016 TU Delft offers 16 [[BSc]] programmes.<ref name=\"TU Delft BSc\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/bachelors/|title=Bachelors |website=TU Delft |publisher=TU Delft |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> TU Delft students obtain their degree after a three-year study. The test project finalizes the BSc studies. All BSc programmes are taught in Dutch, except for [[Aerospace Engineering]], Applied Earth Sciences programmes, Electrical Engineering, Nanobiology, and Computer Science, which are taught entirely in English.\n\n===Master-level studies===\nTU Delft offers around 40 [[MSc]] programmes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/masters/ |title=Masters |website=TU Delft |publisher=TU Delft |accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> The MSc studies take two years to complete.\n\nTU Delft uses the [[European Credit Transfer System]], where each year MSc students are required to obtain 60 ECTS points. An honours track exists for motivated MSc students, who obtained a mark of 7.5 or higher (in [[Academic grading in the Netherlands|Dutch grading scale]]) and did not fail any courses. This track, associated with 30 ECTS points, is taken alongside the regular MSc programme and must be related to student's regular degree courses or the role of [[Technology and society|technology in society]]. The honours track must be completed within the time allowed for the MSc programme.\n\nMSc programmes are also offered through the [[3TU]] federation, [[Erasmus Mundus]] programmes, [[IDEA League]] joint MSc programs and [http://qutech.nl/edu/ QuTech Academy].\n\n===Doctoral-level studies===\n\n[[File:TU Delft PhD Defense committee.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Typical photo following a [[Doctoral studies|doctoral defense]] at Delft University of Technology.

The red tube holds the doctoral diploma. The [[List of academic ranks#Netherlands|promovendus]], as well as the paranymphs must wear white ties, while all professors in the defense committee wear [[toga]]s.]]\n[[Doctoral studies]] at TU Delft are divided into two phases. The first phase, lasting one year, serves as a trial period during which the doctoral candidate must prove capability for performing research on a doctoral level. The candidate must pass the evaluation performed at the end of the year by his/her promoter in order to continue doing research the following three years. The research the candidate performs must be finalized by submitting a [[doctoral thesis]]. The thesis is evaluated by a doctoral committee composed of TU Delft professors and external opponents. Once the thesis has been revised and comments have been taken into account, the candidate gives a formal doctoral defense.\n\nIn contrast to US graduate school, other duties such as following lectures and giving TAs form only a small portion of the programme.\n\n====Doctoral defense====\n\nThe [[Doctoral studies|doctoral defense]] is of ceremonial nature and is held in the senate room. It lasts exactly one hour, during which the doctoral candidate must answer all questions from the committee. Sometimes the candidate is accompanied by one or two [[paranymph]]s, who theoretically might help defend a question asked by a committee member. The defense is ended by the [[Bedel|pedel]], who enters the room and says in Latin ''Hora est'' (''It is time''), stamping the university [[Staff of office|staff]] on the floor. The committee then moves to a separate room to decide whether to grant the candidate a doctorate or not. Then the committee returns to the room where the defense was held, and if the doctorate is granted the promoter presents the [[praise|laudation]] praising the new [[doctor (title)|doctor]]. The entire ceremony is chaired by the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] or a representative.\n\n===Other degree programmes===\n\nTU Delft also offers [[Professional Doctorate in Engineering]].\n\n==Organization==\n\n===Research Institutes===\nTU Delft has three officially recognized [[research institutes]]: Research Institute for the Built Environment,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/architecture-and-the-built-environment/about-the-faculty/departments/otb-research-for-the-built-environment/|title=OTB \u2013 Research for the built environment|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> International Research Centre for Telecommunications-transmission and Radar,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irctr.tudelft.nl/|title=IRCTR Institute TU Delft|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> and [[Reactor Institute Delft]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/faculty-of-applied-sciences/business/facilities/reactor-institute-delft/|title=Reactor Instituut|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2010-01-27}}</ref> In addition to those three institutes, TU Delft hosts numerous smaller research institutes, including the Delft Institute of Microelectronics and Submicron Technology,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/onderzoek/faciliteiten/else-kooi-lab/|title=Else Kooi Lab|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2017-07-01}}</ref> [[Kavli Institute of Nanoscience]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kavli.tudelft.nl/|title=Kavli Institute of Nanoscience|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2019-01-02}}</ref> Materials innovation institute,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.m2i.nl/|title=Materials innovation institute (M2i)|publisher=M2i|accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref> Astrodynamics and Space Missions,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae/organisation/departments/space-engineering/astrodynamics-and-space-missions/ |title=Astrodynamics and Space Missions |publisher=TU Delft |accessdate=2018-02-28 }}</ref> Delft University Wind Energy Research Institute,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/duwind/|title=Delft University Wind Energy Research Institute|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2019-01-02}}</ref>\nTU Delft Safety and Security Institute,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tu-delft-safety-security-institute-dsys/|title=TU Delft Safety and Security Institute|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-06-25}}</ref> and the Delft Space Institute,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spaceinstitute.tudelft.nl|title=Delft Space Institute|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2017-02-10}}</ref> Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics is also an important research institute which connects all engineering departments with respect to research and academia. A complete list of research schools is available on TU Delft website.<ref name=\"TU Delft Research Institutes\"/>\n\n===Research schools===\nImportant part of [[Dutch universities|Dutch university system]] are research schools. They combine education, training and research for PhD candidates and [[postdoc|postdoctoral researchers]] in a given field. The main goal of the research schools is to coordinate nationwide research programs in a given area. Research schools of TU Delft cooperate with other universities in the Netherlands. Research schools are required to have an [[accreditation]] of [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. TU Delft is taking the lead in ten research schools, and participates in nine. The full list of research schools affiliated with TU Delft is available on TU Delft website,<ref name=\"TU Delft Research Institutes\"/> see for example [[TRAIL Research School]].\n\n===Media===\nDuring an [[academic year]] the TU Delft publishes a weekly magazine: ''Delta'',<ref name=\"TU Delta\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.delta.tudelft.nl/|title=Delta|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> which aims at the student and employee community of the university. The newspaper is predominantly in Dutch, with the last few pages published in English. ''TU Delta'' is distributed freely in paper form over the campus and is also available for free on the Internet. Articles focus mainly on current university affairs and student life. The weekly agenda including PhD promotions, inaugural lectures, etc. is also published therein.\n\nAlso, approximately four times a year, the TU Delft publishes a magazine devoted only to research conducted by the university, called ''Delft Outlook''.<ref name=\"Delft Outlook\">{{Cite web|url=http://delftoutlook.tudelft.nl/|title=Delft Outlook|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-02-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215164027/http://delftoutlook.tudelft.nl/|archive-date=2018-02-15|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Delft Outlook'' is published in English, while the same content is published in Dutch in ''[[Delft Integraal]]'' magazine. Both magazines present interviews with TU Delft researchers, university officials. [[Column (periodical)|Columns]] by some university professors are published therein, as well as alumni letters and excerpts from recently published PhD theses.\n\n===Management===\n{{main|List of rectores magnifici of the Delft University of Technology}}\nTU Delft is governed by the [[executive board]] ({{lang|nl|College van Bestuur}}),<ref name=\"Executive Board\"/> controlled and advised by [[student council]], [[workers council]], board of professors, board of doctorates, assistant staff office, committee for the application of the allocation model, operational committee, advisory council for quality and accreditation, [[Dean (education)|dean]]s of each TU Delft [[Faculty (division)|faculty]], and directors of TU Delft [[research center]]s, research schools and [[research institutes]].<ref name=\"TU Delft Research Schools\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/research/thematic-cooperation/research-schools/|title=Research Schools|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-06-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180626033220/https://www.tudelft.nl/en/research/thematic-cooperation/research-schools/|archive-date=2018-06-26|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nExecutive board is chaired academically by the [[Rector (academia)|Rector Magnificus]]. The currently appointed Rector Magnificus, Tim van der Hagen, has held the position since 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/organisation/executive-board/profdrir-tim-van-der-hagen/|title=Prof.dr.ir.

Previous Rectors of TU Delft include Prof. K.F. Wakker (1993\u20131997 and 1998\u20132002), Prof. J. Blauwendraad (1997\u20131998) and Prof. J.T. Fokkema (2002\u20132010). Executive board is accountable to the [[Supervisory Board]], appointed by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (Netherlands)|Minister of Education, Culture and Science]]. One of the many tasks of executive board is the approval of management regulations.\n\nBoard of professors advises in the matter of academic quality, deciding on the selection of guest lecturers, [[research fellows]] as well as revising proposals submitted for royal honors for professors. Board of doctorates appoints supervisors for [[PhD]] students, forms promotion committees, determines promotional code, and confers PhD and doctorate [[Honoris Causa]] degrees. Committee for the application of the allocation model reports to the executive board regarding allocation model. Further, it controls output data supplied to the executive board. Operational committee is composed of members of the executive board and the [[dean (education)|s]]. The committee collaborates on the issues of general importance, related in part to the specific interests of the faculties, and strengthens the unity of the university overall.\n\n==Student life==\nStudent life at TU Delft is organized around numerous [[student societies]] and [[Corporation (university)|corporations]]. They can be generally categorized into [[Professional society|professional societies]], social societies and sport societies. More than half of TU Delft students belong to an officially recognized society{{Ref}}.\n[[File:Koornbeurs delft.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Building of the [[Koornbeurs Society]] in the old town of Delft.]]\n\nThere are two student parties at TU Delft: ORAS<ref name=\"ORAS\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.oras.nl|title=ORAS Student Party Website|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> ({{lang|nl|Organisatie Rationele Studenten}}) and AAG<ref name=\"AAG\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aag.tudelft.nl|title=AAG Student Party Website|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> ({{lang|nl|Afdelings Actie Groepen}}). AAG started as an action group of students in the 1960s, willing to have more impact on the quality of education at then Polytechnic Institute Delft. ORAS became active in the early 1970s as a counterbalance to AAG. Currently those two parties are competing each year for seats in TU Delft's Students Council ({{lang|nl|Studenten Raad}}). Further, all student organizations of TU Delft are associated with The Council of Student Societies Delft VeRa ({{lang|nl|De VerenigingsRaad}}) and The Society for Study and Student Matters Delft VSSD ({{lang|nl|Vereniging voor Studie- en Studentenbelangen Delft}}).\n\nApart from [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor]] and [[Master's student|master]] student organizations, [[PhD]] students of TU Delft have their own organization called Promood (PhD Students Discussion Group Delft) ({{lang|nl|Promovendi Overleg Delft}}), which represents TU Delft PhD students at the university. It is also a member of Dutch PhD Students Network ({{lang|nl|Promovendi Netwerk Nederland}}).\n\nEach faculty of TU Delft has its own set of professional student organizations. Numerous societies are present at the university,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/practical-matters/study-associations-student-associations/|title=Study associations & student associations|publisher=TU Delft|accessdate=2018-02-28}}</ref> many of them with rich traditions, customs and history. For example, [[Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technology|aerospace engineering]] department hosts [[SSVOBB|Foundation for Students in Airplane Development, Manufacturing and Management]] ({{lang|nl|Stichting Studenten Vliegtuigontwikkeling, -bouw en -beheer}}), while [[civil engineering]] department [[Het Gezelschap \"Practische Studie\"|Society for Practical Studies]]. International professional student organizations are also present at TU Delft, including [[EUROAVIA|European Association of Aerospace Students]].\n\nApart from professional student societies, students organize themselves only for the purpose of enriching their social life. Many of the societies have sectarian roots, like a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Menschen Vereeniging Wolbodo|Wolbodo Student Society]], [[Katholieke Studentenvereniging Sanctus Virgilius Delft]], that during the course of the years lost the religious affiliations and accepts students from any denomination.  Besides societies which have their roots in religion, there are also general (with no religious bonds) societies. One of these is [[Sint Jansbrug]]. These societies accept anyone who studies at the TU Delft or any other higher education facility in the Delft area. Also organization that has its roots in [[Rover Scout]] movement [[Delftsche Zwervers]] (at the same time the oldest student scouting group in the world) is present or local branch of the European [[AEGEE]].\n\n{{Main|List of the Sport Student Societies at Delft University of Technology}}\nStudent sports are organized around clubs, that focus mostly on single discipline. Those include rowing society [[D.S.R.V. Laga|Laga]] and rowing club [[Proteus-eretes|Proteus-Eretes]] (both with many [[Olympic medals]] won by the members of the club) or [[American football]] club [[Delft Dragons]].\n\n==Research==\n[[File:Nuna 5.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Nuna 5]], from a series of [[Nuna]] [[solar-powered]] cars that won the [[World Solar Challenge]] seven times, constructed by the students of TU Delft.]]\n[[File:DUT12.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[DUT12]], the twelfth car of the [[Formula Student]] team Delft ([[DUT Racing]]).

{"title_page": "Politics of Zambia", "text_new": "{{short description|Political system of Zambia}}\n{{Politics of Zambia}}\n\nThe '''politics of [[Zambia]]''' takes place in a framework of a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Zambia]] is [[head of state]], [[head of government]] and leader of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, while [[legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament. Formerly [[Northern Rhodesia]], Zambia became a republic immediately upon attaining [[independence]] in October 1964.\n\nWhilst Zambia functioned as a democracy from independence it soon became a one-party state for 19 years from 8 December 1972 until Multi-Party democracy was re-introduced on 4 December 1990 which led to Multi-Party elections on 1 November 1991. Since then Zambia has been a relatively stable democracy having consistently peacefully transferred power between three political parties ([[United National Independence Party|UNIP]], [[Movement for Multi-Party Democracy|MMD]] and [[Patriotic Front (Zambia)|PF]]) and has since 1991 held 8 presidential elections of which 6 were general elections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uca.edu/politicalscience/dadm-project/sub-saharan-africa-region/zambia-1964-present/|title=47. Zambia (1964-present)|website=uca.edu|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref>\n\n{{Democracy Index rating|Zambia|hybrid regime|2019}} The EIU has also consistently put Zambia among the top ten most democratic African countries, ranking it 9th in Africa and 86 in the world as of 2018 (167 states). This is also while [[Freedom in the World|Freedom House]] ranks Zambia as \u2018Partly Free\u2019 with a score of 55/100 (0- least free and 100 mostly free) as of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2018/zambia|title=Zambia|date=2018-01-05|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref>\n\n== Government and constitution ==\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|Section|date=August 2011}}\n\nThe constitution promulgated on August 25, 1973, abrogated the original 1964 constitution. The new constitution and the national elections that followed in December 1973 were the final steps in achieving what was called a \"one-party participatory democracy\".\n\nThe 1973 constitution provided for a strong president and a unicameral National Assembly. National policy was formulated by the Central Committee of the [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP), the sole legal party in [[Zambia]]. The cabinet executed the central committee's policy.\n\nIn accordance with the intention to formalize UNIP supremacy in the new system, the constitution stipulated that the sole candidate in [[election]]s for the office of [[President (government title)|president]] was the person selected to be the president of UNIP by the party's general conference. The second-ranking person in the Zambian hierarchy was UNIP's secretary general.\n\nIn December 1990, at the end of a tumultuous year that included [[riot]]s in the capital and an attempted [[coup]], President Kaunda signed legislation ending UNIP's monopoly on power. In response to growing popular demand for multiparty [[democracy]], and after lengthy, difficult negotiations between the Kaunda government and opposition groups, Zambia enacted a new constitution in August 1991. The constitution enlarged the National Assembly from 136 members to a maximum of 158 members, established an electoral commission, and allowed for more than one presidential candidate who no longer had to be a member of UNIP. The constitution was amended again in 1996 to set new limits on the presidency (including a retroactive two-term limit, and a requirement that both parents of a candidate be Zambian-born).

Kaunda tried to base government on his philosophy of \"[[humanism]]\", which condemned human [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and stressed [[cooperation]] among people, but not at the expense of the individual. During Kaunda's presidency, members of all ethnic groups were represented by ministers in the government, in relation to their demographic size.<ref name=epr>{{cite web |author=GROWup - Geographical Research On War, Unified Platform |title=Ethnicity in Zambia |url=https://growup.ethz.ch/atlas/Zambia |publisher=ETH Zurich |accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nKaunda's political party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP), was founded in 1959 and was in power under Kaunda's leadership from 1964 to 1991. Before 1972, Zambia had three significant political parties: UNIP, the [[Northern Rhodesian African National Congress]], and the United Progressive Party (UPP). The ANC drew its strength from western and southern provinces, while the UPP found some support among [[Bemba language|Bemba]] speakers in the [[copperbelt]] and northern provinces. Although not strongly supported in all areas of the country, only UNIP had a nationwide following.\n\n===One-party state===\nIn February 1972, Zambia became a [[one-party state]], and all other political parties were banned. Kaunda, the sole candidate, was elected president in the 1973 elections. Elections also were held for the National Assembly. Only UNIP members were permitted to run, but these seats were sharply contested. President Kaunda's mandate was renewed in December 1978 and October 1983 in a \"yes\" or \"no\" vote on his candidacy. In the 1983 election, more than 60% of those registered participated and gave President Kaunda a 93% \"yes\" vote.\n\n===1991: Move to a multiparty state===\nGrowing opposition to UNIP's monopoly on power led to the rise in 1990 of the [[Movement for Multiparty Democracy]] (MMD). The MMD assembled an increasingly impressive group of important Zambians, including prominent UNIP defectors and labor leaders. During the year, President Kaunda agreed to a referendum on the one-party state but, in the face of continued opposition, dropped the referendum and signed a [[constitutional amendment]] making Zambia a multi-party state. Zambia's first multi-party elections for parliament and the presidency since the 1960s were held on October 31, 1991. MMD candidate [[Frederick Chiluba]] resoundingly carried the presidential election over Kenneth Kaunda with 76% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/zambia-1991-presidential-election-national-results |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210407/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/zambia-1991-presidential-election-national-results |archivedate=2014-07-14 }}</ref> To add to the MMD landslide, in the [[parliamentary election]]s the MMD won 125 of the 150 elected seats and UNIP the remaining 25. However, UNIP swept the Eastern Province, gathering 19 of its seats there.\n\n===1991\u20132001: MMD and Frederick Chiluba===\nBy the end of Chiluba's first term as president (1996), the MMD's commitment to political reform had faded in the face of re-election demands. A number of prominent supporters founded opposing parties. Relying on the MMD's overwhelming majority in parliament, President Chiluba in May 1996 pushed through constitutional amendments that eliminated former President Kaunda and other prominent opposition leaders from the [[Zambian presidential election, 1996|1996 presidential elections]].\n\nIn the presidential and parliamentary elections held in November 1996, Chiluba was re-elected, and the MMD won 131 of the 150 seats in the National Assembly. Kaunda's UNIP party [[boycott]]ed the parliamentary polls to protest the exclusion of its leader from the presidential race, alleging in addition that the outcome of the election had been predetermined due to a faulty voter registration exercise. Despite the UNIP boycott, the elections took place peacefully, and five presidential and more than 600 parliamentary candidates from 11 parties participated. Afterward, however, several opposition parties and [[non-governmental organization]]s declared the elections neither free nor fair. As President Chiluba began his second term in 1997, the opposition continued to reject the results of the election amid international efforts to encourage the MMD and the opposition to resolve their differences through dialogue.\n\nEarly in 2001, supporters of President Chiluba mounted a campaign to amend the constitution to enable Chiluba to seek a third term of office. Civil society, opposition parties, and many members of the ruling party complimented widespread popular opposition to exert sufficient pressure on Chiluba to force him to back away from any attempt at a third term.\n\nPresidential, parliamentary, and local government elections were held on December 27, 2001. Eleven parties contested the elections. The elections encountered numerous administrative problems. Opposition parties alleged that serious irregularities occurred. Nevertheless, MMD presidential candidate [[Levy Mwanawasa]] was declared the victor by a narrow margin, and he was sworn into office on January 2, 2002. Three parties submitted petitions to the High Court, challenging the presidential election results. The courts decided that there had been irregularities but that they were not serious enough to have affected the overall result, thus the election result was upheld. Opposition parties won a majority of parliamentary seats in the December, 2001 election, but subsequent by-elections gave the ruling MMD a slim majority in Parliament.\n\n===2001\u20132008===\nIn the [[Zambian presidential election, 2006|2006 presidential election]] was hotly contested, with Mwanawasa being re-elected by a clear margin over principal challengers [[Michael Sata]] of the [[Patriotic Front (Zambia)|Patriotic Front]] and [[Hakainde Hichilema]] of the [[United Party for National Development]] (UPND).\n\nThe parliamentary election that same year awarded MMD with 72 seats, the remaining 84 seats split among other parties with the majority of those seats going to the Patriotic Front.\n\nThe presidency of Levy Mwanawasa until his death in office in mid-2008, was different than the flamboyant expenditure and increasingly apparent corruption of the later years of Frederick Chiluba's terms in office.  Indeed, the former president was arrested and charged with several counts of [[embezzlement]] and [[Political corruption|corruption]], firmly quashing initial fears that President Mwanawasa would [[turn a blind eye]] to the allegations of his predecessor's improprieties.\n\nMwanawasa was accused by some observers of demonstrating an authoritarian streak in early 2004 when his Minister of Home Affairs issued a deportation order to a British citizen and long-time Zambian resident Roy Clarke, who had published a series of satirical attacks on the President in the independent Post newspaper. However, when Clarke appealed to the High Court against the order, the judge ruled that the order was arbitrary and unjustified and quashed the order. President Mwanawasa, true to his mantra of heading a government of laws, respected the court decision and Clarke was allowed to resume his column of satirical critique. Mwanawasa's early zeal to root out corruption also waned somewhat, with key witnesses in the Chiluba trial leaving the country. The Constitutional Review Commission set up by Mwanawasa also hit some turbulence, with arguments as to where its findings should be submitted leading to suspicions that he has been trying to manipulate the outcome. Generally, the Zambian electorate viewed Mwanawasa's rule as a great improvement over Chiluba's.\n\nFollowing Mwanawasa's death in August 2008, Zambian vice president [[Rupiah Banda]] succeeded him to the office of president, to be held as a temporary position until the emergency election on October 30, 2008.  Banda won by a narrow margin over opposition leader Michael Sata, to complete the remainder of Mwanawasa's term.\n\n===2011 elections===\n[[Rupiah Banda]] lost re-election in the 2011 Presidential and Parliamentary elections to [[Michael Sata]] of the [[Patriotic Front (Zambia)|Patriotic Front]] bringing an end to a total of 20 years rule by 3 presidents from the [[Movement for Multi-Party Democracy|MMD]].\n\n===2015\u2013Present===\nEdgar Chagwa Lungu was sworn in as president of Zambia on January 25, 2015, succeeding acting-president [[Guy Scott]] who briefly held the office after the passing of Michael Chiluyfa Sata. Lungu's presidency has thus far been criticised for failing to halt the depreciating [[Zambian Kwacha|Kwacha]]. There have also been unsubstantiated reports of Lungu's alleged alcoholism, stemming from a reported physical collapse early in his presidency.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. The economic challenges facing Zambia, in particular the depreciating Kwacha, have been attributed to the global fall of commodity prices. Zambia derives over 90% of its export earnings from a single commodity, copper, which has lost about 45% of its value on the international commodity market.\n\nOn 5 January 2016, Lungu successfully concluded long-standing constitutional issues when he assented to the 2015 Constitutional Amendment Bill. This Bill is the result of extensive work begun during the Mwanawasa era (The Mwanakatwe Commission) and continued by the Michael Chilufya Sata appointed Technical Committee. As Justice Minister, Lungu had previously presented the Draft Constitution to parliament where it was subsequently decided that non-contentious issues will be debated in parliament and contentious issues will be subject to a referendum.\n\n== Executive branch ==\nThe executive branch of the Zambian government is vested in the  president who is elected in a [[Two-round system|two round system]]. Presidents serve terms of five years and are limited to two terms.\n\nPrior to the 2016 Constitutional Amendment the Zambian vice-president was appointed by the president, but the current 2016 amendment puts the vice-president on the same electoral ticket as the president ([[running mate]]) (Article 110 Sec 2, 3 and 4) and in the event of a vacancy of an elected president the Vice President is the immediate successor to the president and remains President until the next general election (Article 106 Sec 5(a) and Sec 6).<ref>{{Cite web|url=41.77.4.167:6510/www.parliament.gov.zm/sites/default/files/documents/amendment_act/Constitution%20of%20Zambia%20%20(Amendment),%202016-Act%20No.%202_0.pdf|title=Constitution of Zambia (Amendment)|last=National Assembly of Zambia|date=5 January 2015|website=Parliament of Zambia|access-date=3 September 2019}}</ref> This is in contrast to the 1996 constitution that required a by-election within 90 days of an elected president's vacancy with the Vice President acting as an interim (as was the case with former Acting-President [[Guy Scott]] in October 2014 to January 2015 and former President Rupiah Banda in 2008 after the deaths of Presidents [[Michael Sata|Sata]] and [[Levy Mwanawasa|Mwanawasa]] respectfully).\n\nThe presidency is currently filled by [[Edgar Lungu]] with [[Inonge Wina]] as Vice President since [[2015 Zambian presidential election|2015]] after a by-election to replace Micheal Sata and was re-elected in [[2016 Zambian general election|2016]] for a 5-year term.\n\n== Legislative branch ==\n\nThe [[unicameral]] '''[[National Assembly of Zambia]]''' is the country's legislative body.

Many of these organisations were based in Zambia during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nPresident Chiluba assumed a somewhat higher profile internationally in the mid- and late 1990s. His government played a constructive regional role sponsoring Angola peace talks that led to the 1994 Lusaka Protocols. Zambia has provided troops to UN peacekeeping initiatives in [[Mozambique]], [[Rwanda]], [[Angola]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Zambia was the first African state to cooperate with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] into the [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwandan genocide]] in 1994.\n\nIn 1998, Zambia took the lead in efforts to establish a cease-fire in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Zambia was active in the Congolese peace effort after the signing of a cease-fire agreement in Lusaka in July and August 1999, although activity diminished considerably after the Joint Military Commission tasked with implementing the ceasefire relocated to [[Kinshasa]] in September 2001.\n\nZambia is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).\n\n===Participation in international organizations===\nZambia is a member of [[ACP (Lom\u00e9 Convention)|ACP]], [[African Development Bank|AfDB]], [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa|COMESA]], [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|ECA]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], G-19, [[Group of 77|G-77]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Criminal Court|ICCt]], [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions|ICFTU]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|IFRCS]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]], [[IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[MONUC]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organisation of African Unity|OAU]], [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]], [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNAMSIL]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea|UNMEE]], [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[World Confederation of Labour|WCL]], [[World Customs Organization|WCO]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Tourism Organization|WToO]] and the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{curlie|Regional/Africa/Zambia/Government|Zambia Government}}\n\n{{Zambian political parties}}\n{{Africa in topic|Politics of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Politics Of Zambia}}\n[[Category:Politics of Zambia| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Political system of Zambia}}\n{{Politics of Zambia}}\n\nThe '''politics of [[Zambia]]''' takes place in a framework of a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Zambia]] is [[head of state]], [[head of government]] and leader of a [[multi-party system]].

Since then Zambia has been a relatively stable democracy having consistently peacefully transferred power between three political parties ([[United National Independence Party|UNIP]], [[Movement for Multi-Party Democracy|MMD]] and [[Patriotic Front (Zambia)|PF]]) and has since 1991 held 8 presidential elections of which 6 were general elections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uca.edu/politicalscience/dadm-project/sub-saharan-africa-region/zambia-1964-present/|title=47.

The new constitution and the national elections that followed in December 1973 were the final steps in achieving what was called a \"one-party participatory democracy\".\n\nThe 1973 constitution provided for a strong president and a unicameral National Assembly. National policy was formulated by the Central Committee of the [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP), the sole legal party in [[Zambia]]. The cabinet executed the central committee's policy.\n\nIn accordance with the intention to formalize UNIP supremacy in the new system, the constitution stipulated that the sole candidate in [[election]]s for the office of [[President (government title)|president]] was the person selected to be the president of UNIP by the party's general conference. The second-ranking person in the Zambian hierarchy was UNIP's secretary general.\n\nIn December 1990, at the end of a tumultuous year that included [[riot]]s in the capital and an attempted [[coup]], President Kaunda signed legislation ending UNIP's monopoly on power. In response to growing popular demand for multiparty [[democracy]], and after lengthy, difficult negotiations between the Kaunda government and opposition groups, Zambia enacted a new constitution in August 1991.

As Justice Minister, Lungu had previously presented the Draft Constitution to parliament where it was subsequently decided that non-contentious issues will be debated in parliament and contentious issues will be subject to a referendum.\n\n== Executive branch ==\nThe executive branch of the Zambian government is vested in the  president who is elected in a [[Two-round system|two round stystem]]. Presidents serve terms of five years and are limited to two terms.\n\nPrior to the 2016 Constitutional Amendment the Zambian vice-president was appointed by the president, but the current 2016 amendment puts the vice-president on the same electoral ticket as the president ([[running mate]]) (Article 110 Sec 2, 3 and 4) and in the event of a vacancy of an elected president the Vice President is the immediate successor to the president and remains President until the next general election (Article 106 Sec 5(a) and Sec 6).<ref>{{Cite web|url=41.77.4.167:6510/www.parliament.gov.zm/sites/default/files/documents/amendment_act/Constitution%20of%20Zambia%20%20(Amendment),%202016-Act%20No.%202_0.pdf|title=Constitution of Zambia (Amendment)|last=National Assembly of Zambia|date=5 January 2015|website=Parliament of Zambia|access-date=3 September 2019}}</ref> This is in contrast to the 1996 constitution that required a by-election within 90 days of an elected president's vacancy with the Vice President acting as an interim (as was the case with former Acting-President [[Guy Scott]] in October 2014 to January 2015 and former President Rupiah Banda in 2008 after the deaths of Presidents [[Michael Sata|Sata]] and [[Levy Mwanawasa|Mwanawasa]] respectfully).\n\nThe presidency is currently filled by [[Edgar Lungu]] with [[Inonge Wina]] as Vice President since [[2015 Zambian presidential election|2015]] after a by-election to replace Micheal Sata and was re-elected in [[2016 Zambian general election|2016]] for a 5-year term.\n\n== Legislative branch ==\n\nThe [[unicameral]] '''[[National Assembly of Zambia]]''' is the country's legislative body. The current National Assembly, formed following elections held on 28 September 2006, has a total of 158 members. 150 members are directly elected in single-member [[Constituency|constituencies]] using the simple majority (or [[First-past-the-post]]) system. The remaining 8 seats are filled through [[President of Zambia|presidential]] appointment. All members serve five-year terms.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{main|List of political parties in Zambia|Elections in Zambia}}\n===Presidential elections===\n{{main|2016 Zambian general election}}\n{{#section-h:2016 Zambian general election|President}}\n===Parliamentary elections===\n{{main|2016 Zambian general election}}\n{{#section-h:2016 Zambian general election|National Assembly}}\n== Judicial branch ==\n[[File:Zambia Supreme Court.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Supreme Court building in [[Lusaka]]]]\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Zambia|Supreme Court]] is the highest court and the court of appeal; below it are the high [[court]], magistrate's court, and local courts.

The Zambia Police force is not part of the defense force, it was established for internal security services and is under the ministry of home affairs.\n\n== Foreign relations ==\n\nZambia is a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] (NAM), the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the [[African Union]] (and its predecessor the [[Organization of African Unity]] or OAU), the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), and the [[COMESA|Common Market for Africa]] (COMA), which is headquartered in Lusaka.\n\nPresident Kaunda was a persistent and visible advocate of change in Southern Africa, supporting liberation movements in Mozambique, Namibia, Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), and South Africa. Many of these organisations were based in Zambia during the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nPresident Chiluba assumed a somewhat higher profile internationally in the mid- and late 1990s. His government played a constructive regional role sponsoring Angola peace talks that led to the 1994 Lusaka Protocols. Zambia has provided troops to UN peacekeeping initiatives in [[Mozambique]], [[Rwanda]], [[Angola]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Zambia was the first African state to cooperate with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] into the [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwandan genocide]] in 1994.\n\nIn 1998, Zambia took the lead in efforts to establish a cease-fire in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Zambia was active in the Congolese peace effort after the signing of a cease-fire agreement in Lusaka in July and August 1999, although activity diminished considerably after the Joint Military Commission tasked with implementing the ceasefire relocated to [[Kinshasa]] in September 2001.\n\nZambia is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]] with a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[United States|US]]-military (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]).\n\n===Participation in international organizations===\nZambia is a member of [[ACP (Lom\u00e9 Convention)|ACP]], [[African Development Bank|AfDB]], [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa|COMESA]], [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|ECA]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], G-19, [[Group of 77|G-77]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Criminal Court|ICCt]], [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions|ICFTU]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|IFRCS]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]], [[IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[MONUC]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organisation of African Unity|OAU]], [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]], [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNAMSIL]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea|UNMEE]], [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[World Confederation of Labour|WCL]], [[World Customs Organization|WCO]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Tourism Organization|WToO]] and the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{curlie|Regional/Africa/Zambia/Government|Zambia Government}}\n\n{{Zambian political parties}}\n{{Africa in topic|Politics of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Politics Of Zambia}}\n[[Category:Politics of Zambia| ]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: stystem \u2192 system", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Zambia"}
