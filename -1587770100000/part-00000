Its name comes from the [[asterisk]] (*) symbol for a signal used in [[dual-tone multi-frequency signaling|dual-tone multi-frequency]] (DTMF) dialing.\n\nAsterisk was created in 1999 by [[Mark Spencer (computer engineer)|Mark Spencer]] of [[Digium]], today a division of [[Sangoma Technologies Corporation]].<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Stephen P. | last1 = Olejniczak | first2 = Brady | last2 = Kirby | title = Asterisk For Dummies | isbn = 9780470098547 | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] | year = 2007 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/asteriskfordummi0000olej }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first1 = Jim | last1 = Van Meggelen | first2 = Jared | last2 = Smith | first3 = Leif | last3 = Madsen | title = Asterisk: The Future of Telephony | isbn = 9780596510480 | publisher = [[O'Reilly Media, Inc.]] | year = 2007 }}</ref> Originally designed for [[Linux]],<ref>The README for version 0.1.0 states: \"Currently, the Asterisk Open Source PBX is only known to run on the Linux OS, although it may be portable to other UNIX-like operating systems as well.\" See [http://git.asterisk.org/gitweb/?p=asterisk/asterisk.git;a=blob;f=README;h=c50c462a7bd587dc39c9b16b862d7cf824c1fe80;hb=da258e1541aff8da8512849c302748fde369c8ab here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212090901/http://git.asterisk.org/gitweb/?p=asterisk%2Fasterisk.git%3Ba%3Dblob%3Bf%3DREADME%3Bh%3Dc50c462a7bd587dc39c9b16b862d7cf824c1fe80%3Bhb%3Dda258e1541aff8da8512849c302748fde369c8ab |date=2017-02-12 }}</ref> Asterisk runs on a variety of [[operating system]]s, including [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], [[FreeBSD]], [[macOS]], and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and can be installed in embedded systems based on [[OpenWrt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/voip/asterisk |title=Asterisk on OpenWrt |accessdate=2018-06-10}}</ref><ref>[http://doc.astlinux.org/userdoc:boot-usb-storage AstLinux: Boot via USB Flash Storage]</ref>\n\n==Features==\nThe Asterisk software includes many features available in commercial and proprietary PBX systems: [[voice mail]], [[conference call]]ing, [[interactive voice response]] (phone menus), and [[automatic call distribution]]. Users can create new functionality by writing dial plan scripts in several of Asterisk's own ''extensions'' languages, by adding custom loadable modules written in PHP or [[C (programming language)|C]], or by implementing ''[[Asterisk Gateway Interface]]'' (AGI) programs using any programming language capable of communicating via the standard streams system ([[stdin]] and [[stdout]]) or by network TCP sockets.\n\nAsterisk supports several standard [[voice over IP]] protocols, including the [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP), the [[Media Gateway Control Protocol]] (MGCP), and [[H.323]]. Asterisk supports most SIP telephones, acting both as registrar and [[back-to-back user agent]]. It can serve as a gateway between IP phones and the public switched telephone network (PSTN) via T- or E-carrier interfaces or analog FXO cards. The [[Inter-Asterisk eXchange]]<nowiki> (IAX) protocol, RFC 5456, native to Asterisk, provides efficient </nowiki>[[trunking]] of calls between Asterisk PBX systems, in addition to distributing some configuration logic. Many VoIP service providers support it for call completion into the PSTN, often because they themselves have deployed Asterisk or offer it as a hosted application. Some telephones also support the IAX protocol.\n\nBy supporting a variety of traditional and VoIP telephony services, Asterisk allows deployers to build telephone systems, or migrate existing systems to new technologies. Some sites are using Asterisk to replace proprietary PBXes, others provide additional features, such as voice mail or voice response menus, or virtual [[call shop]]s, or to reduce cost by carrying long-distance calls over the Internet (toll bypass).\n\nIn addition to VoIP protocols, Asterisk supports traditional circuit-switching protocols such as [[Integrated_Services_Digital_Network|ISDN]] and [[Signalling_System_No._7|SS7]]. This requires appropriate hardware interface cards, marketed by third-party vendors. Each protocol requires the installation of software modules. In Asterisk release 14 the [[Opus (audio format)|Opus audio codec]] is supported.\n\n==Internationalization==\nWhile initially developed in the [[United States]], Asterisk has become a popular [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] PBX worldwide. It allows having multiple sets of voice prompts identified by language (and even multiple sets of prompts for each language) as well as support for time formats  in different languages. Several sets of prompts for the interactive voice response and voice mail features are included with Asterisk: American, British, and Australian English, Canadian French, Japanese, Russian, Mexican Spanish and Swedish.<ref>[http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/sounds/ download page of sound files for Asterisk]</ref> A few novelty prompts are offered, such as jokes<ref>\u05e5 [http://www.speechtechblog.com/2011/02/16/you-are-not-the-next-caller-in-line \"You are not the next caller in line\"], parody on-hold message where a pre-recorded Allison Smith sheepishly confesses (at 0:00:45) that the caller is actually *not* next in queue and would be lucky to get a response at 11:30pm from the cleaning lady after other workers had left for the day.</ref> and a themed \"zombie apocalypse\" message for [[Halloween]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://go.digium.com/zombie-proof-your-phone-system |title=Zombie-Proof Your Phone System |publisher=Go.digium.com |accessdate=2016-01-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305004354/http://go.digium.com/zombie-proof-your-phone-system |archivedate=2016-03-05 }}</ref> Additionally, voice sets are offered for commercial sale in various languages, dialects, and genders.\n\nThe default set of English-language Asterisk prompts are recorded by professional telephone voice Allison Smith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theivrvoice.com/asterisk-voice-recording/|title=Asterisk Voice Recordings|work=The IVR Voice}}</ref>\n\n==Derived products==\nAsterisk is a core component in many commercial products and open-source projects.

This interface (which is at the heart of many of the most popular Asterisk distributions, such as AsteriskNOW, Elastix, the FreePBX Distro, and PBX in a Flash), is unarguably a very large part of why Asterisk has been as successful as it has. With the FreePBX interface, you can configure and manage many aspects of an Asterisk system without touching a single configuration file. While we purists may like everyone to work only with the config files, we recognize that for many, learning Linux and editing these files by hand is simply not going to happen.

This interface (which is at the heart of many of the most popular Asterisk distributions, such as AsteriskNOW, Elastix, the FreePBX Distro, and PBX in a Flash), is unarguably a very large part of why Asterisk has been as successful as it has. With the FreePBX interface, you can configure and manage many aspects of an Asterisk system without touching a single configuration file. While we purists may like everyone to work only with the config files, we recognize that for many, learning Linux and editing these files by hand is simply not going to happen. For those folks, there is FreePBX, and it has our respect for the important contributions it has made to the success of Asterisk.}}</ref> \n* [[LinuxMCE]] bundles Asterisk to provide telephony; there is also an embedded version of Asterisk for OpenWrt routers.\n* PBX in a Flash/Incredible PBX and [[trixbox]] are software PBXes based on Asterisk.\n* [[Elastix]] previously used Asterisk, [[HylaFAX]], [[Openfire]] and [[Postfix (software)|Postfix]] to offer PBX, fax, instant messaging and email functions, respectively, before switching to [[3CX]].\n* [[Issabel]] is an open-source [[Unified Communications]] software which uses Asterisk for telephony functions.

Fukuyama predicted the eventual global triumph of political and economic liberalism:\n\n{{quote|What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history as such.... That is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.}}\n\nAuthors like [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] argued in 1990 that the essay gave Fukuyama his [[15 minutes of fame]], which will be followed by a slide into obscurity.<ref>Dahrendorf (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=obx2BX91FQUC&pg=PA37 ''Reflections on the revolution in Europe''] p. 37</ref><ref>[[Luciano Canfora]] [http://temi.repubblica.it/micromega-online/la-grande-illusione-del-capitalismo-eterno/ ''La grande illusione del capitalismo eterno''] preface to Ercolani, Paolo ''La storia infinita.

Postmodern philosophy had, in Fukuyama's opinion, undermined the ideology behind liberal democracy, leaving the western world in a potentially weaker position.<ref>'Francis Fukuyama, \"Reflections on the End of History, Five Years Later\", ''History and Theory'' 34, 2: \"World Historians and Their Critics\" (May 1995): 43.</ref> The fact that Marxism and fascism had been proven untenable for practical use while liberal democracy still thrived was reason enough to embrace the hopeful attitude of the Progressive era, as this hope for the future was what made a society worth struggling to maintain. Postmodernism, which, by this time, had become embedded in the cultural consciousness, offered no hope and nothing to sustain a necessary sense of community, instead relying only on lofty intellectual premises.<ref>'Francis Fukuyama, \"Reflections on the End of History, Five Years Later\", ''History and Theory'' 34, 2: World Historians and Their Critics (May 1995): 36.</ref> Being a work that both praised the ideals of a group that had fallen out of favor and challenged the premises of the group that had replaced them, it was bound to create some controversy.\n\nFukuyama has written a number of other books, among them ''Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity'' and ''[[Our Posthuman Future|Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution]]''. In the latter, he qualified his original \"end of history\" thesis, arguing that since biotechnology increasingly allows humans to control their own [[evolution]], it may allow humans to alter [[human nature]], thereby putting liberal democracy at risk.<ref>For a critical analysis of Fukuyama's bioethical argument, see: {{Cite journal | last1 = Jordaan | first1 = D.

He is a fierce enemy of [[transhumanism]], an intellectual movement asserting that [[posthuman]]ity is a desirable goal.\n\nIn another work, ''The Great Disruption: Human Nature and the Reconstruction of Social Order'', Fukuyama explores the origins of social norms, and analyses the current disruptions in the fabric of our moral traditions, which he considers as arising from a shift from the manufacturing to the information age. This shift is, he thinks, normal and will prove self-correcting, given the intrinsic human need for social norms and rules.\n\nIn 2006, in ''[[America at the Crossroads]]'', Fukuyama discusses the history of neoconservatism, with particular focus on its major tenets and political implications. He outlines his rationale for supporting the Bush administration, as well as where he believes it has gone wrong.\n\nIn 2008, Fukuyama published the book ''Falling Behind: Explaining the Development Gap Between Latin America and the United States'', which resulted from research and a conference funded by Grupo Mayan to gain understanding on why Latin America, once far wealthier than North America, fell behind in terms of development in only a matter of centuries. Discussing this book at a 2009 conference, Fukuyama outlined his belief that inequality within Latin American nations is a key impediment to growth. An unequal distribution of wealth, he stated, leads to social upheaval, which then results in stunted growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devex.com/blogs/17/blogs_entries/59071|title=Fukuyama: \"Social Agenda\" Needed to Combat Poverty in Latin America|author=Ryan Weddle|work=[[Devex]]|date=February 18, 2009|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHis most recent book, published in 2018, is ''Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment''.\n\n===Neoconservatism===\nAs a key [[Reagan Administration]] contributor to the formulation of the [[Reagan Doctrine]], Fukuyama is an important figure in the rise of [[neoconservatism]], although his works came out years after [[Irving Kristol]]'s 1972 book crystallized neoconservatism.<ref>[[Irving Kristol]] (1972), ''On the Democratic Idea in America'', New York: Harper.</ref> Fukuyama was active in the [[Project for the New American Century]] think tank starting in 1997, and as a member co-signed the organization's 1998 [[Project for the New American Century#Open letter to President Clinton on Iraq|letter]] recommending that [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] support Iraqi insurgencies in the overthrow of then-President of [[Iraq]] [[Saddam Hussein]].<ref name=PNACClinton>{{cite web| url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909200819/http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm| archivedate=September 9, 2008| title=Letter to President Clinton on Iraq| accessdate=August 16, 2008| author=Abrams, Elliott| date=January 26, 1998| format=PDF| display-authors=etal| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all| author-link=Elliott Abrams}}</ref> He was also among forty co-signers of [[Bill Kristol|William Kristol's]] September 20, 2001 letter to President [[George W.

A latent military force is more likely to have an effect than actual deployment. The US spends 43% of [[List of countries by military expenditures|global military spending]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/15majorspenders |title=The 15 countries with the highest military expenditure in 2009 |accessdate=May 5, 2011}}</ref> but Iraq shows there are limits to its effectiveness.\n\nThe US should instead stimulate political and economic development and gain a better understanding of what happens in other countries. The best instruments are setting a good example and providing education and, in many cases, money. The secret of development, be it political or economic, is that it never comes from outsiders, but always from people in the country itself. One thing the US proved to have excelled in during the aftermath of [[World War II]] was the formation of international institutions. A return to support for these structures would combine American power with international legitimacy. But such measures require a lot of patience. This is the central thesis of his 2006 work ''[[America at the Crossroads]]''.\n\nIn a 2006 essay in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' strongly critical of the invasion, he identified neoconservatism with [[Leninism]]. He wrote that neoconservatives:<ref name=\"After Neoconservatism\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/magazine/neo.html?ex=1298005200&en=4126fa38fefd80de&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss|title=After Neoconservatism|author=Francis Fukuyama|date=February 19, 2006|accessdate=May 13, 2007|work=[[The New York Times Magazine]]}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|believed that history can be pushed along with the right application of power and will.

It is hard to imagine a more disastrous presidency than that of George W. Bush. It was bad enough that he launched an unnecessary war and undermined the standing of the United States throughout the world in his first term. But in the waning days of his administration, he is presiding over a collapse of the American financial system and broader economy that will have consequences for years to come. As a general rule, democracies don't work well if voters do not hold political parties accountable for failure. While [[John McCain]] is trying desperately to pretend that he never had anything to do with the Republican Party, I think it would be a travesty to reward the Republicans for failure on such a grand scale.}}\n\nIn a 2018 interview with ''[[New Statesman]]'', when asked about his views on the resurgence of [[socialist]] politics in the United States and the United Kingdom, he responded:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/observations/2018/10/francis-fukuyama-interview-socialism-ought-come-back|title=Francis Fukuyama interview: \"Socialism ought to come back\"|author= George Eaton|date=October 17, 2018|accessdate=October 17, 2018|work=New Statesman America}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|It all depends on what you mean by socialism.

Fukuyama predicted the eventual global triumph of political and economic liberalism:\n\n{{quote|What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history as such.... That is, the end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.}}\n\nAuthors like [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] argued in 1990 that the essay gave Fukuyama his [[15 minutes of fame]], which will be followed by a slide into obscurity.<ref>Dahrendorf (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=obx2BX91FQUC&pg=PA37 ''Reflections on the revolution in Europe''] p. 37</ref><ref>[[Luciano Canfora]] [http://temi.repubblica.it/micromega-online/la-grande-illusione-del-capitalismo-eterno/ ''La grande illusione del capitalismo eterno''] preface to Ercolani, Paolo ''La storia infinita.

Postmodern philosophy had, in Fukuyama's opinion, undermined the ideology behind liberal democracy, leaving the western world in a potentially weaker position.<ref>'Francis Fukuyama, \"Reflections on the End of History, Five Years Later\", ''History and Theory'' 34, 2: \"World Historians and Their Critics\" (May 1995): 43.</ref> The fact that Marxism and fascism had been proven untenable for practical use while liberal democracy still thrived was reason enough to embrace the hopeful attitude of the Progressive era, as this hope for the future was what made a society worth struggling to maintain. Postmodernism, which, by this time, had become embedded in the cultural consciousness, offered no hope and nothing to sustain a necessary sense of community, instead relying only on lofty intellectual premises.<ref>'Francis Fukuyama, \"Reflections on the End of History, Five Years Later\", ''History and Theory'' 34, 2: World Historians and Their Critics (May 1995): 36.</ref> Being a work that both praised the ideals of a group that had fallen out of favor and challenged the premises of the group that had replaced them, it was bound to create some controversy.\n\nFukuyama has written a number of other books, among them ''Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity'' and ''[[Our Posthuman Future|Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution]]''. In the latter, he qualified his original \"end of history\" thesis, arguing that since biotechnology increasingly allows humans to control their own [[evolution]], it may allow humans to alter [[human nature]], thereby putting liberal democracy at risk.<ref>For a critical analysis of Fukuyama's bioethical argument, see: {{Cite journal | last1 = Jordaan | first1 = D.

He is a fierce enemy of [[transhumanism]], an intellectual movement asserting that [[posthuman]]ity is a desirable goal.\n\nIn another work, ''The Great Disruption: Human Nature and the Reconstruction of Social Order'', Fukuyama explores the origins of social norms, and analyses the current disruptions in the fabric of our moral traditions, which he considers as arising from a shift from the manufacturing to the information age. This shift is, he thinks, normal and will prove self-correcting, given the intrinsic human need for social norms and rules.\n\nIn 2006, in ''[[America at the Crossroads]]'', Fukuyama discusses the history of neoconservatism, with particular focus on its major tenets and political implications. He outlines his rationale for supporting the Bush administration, as well as where he believes it has gone wrong.\n\nIn 2008, Fukuyama published the book ''Falling Behind: Explaining the Development Gap Between Latin America and the United States'', which resulted from research and a conference funded by Grupo Mayan to gain understanding on why Latin America, once far wealthier than North America, fell behind in terms of development in only a matter of centuries. Discussing this book at a 2009 conference, Fukuyama outlined his belief that inequality within Latin American nations is a key impediment to growth. An unequal distribution of wealth, he stated, leads to social upheaval, which then results in stunted growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devex.com/blogs/17/blogs_entries/59071|title=Fukuyama: \"Social Agenda\" Needed to Combat Poverty in Latin America|author=Ryan Weddle|work=[[Devex]]|date=February 18, 2009|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}</ref>\n\nHis most recent book, published in 2018, is ''Identity: The Demand for Dignity and the Politics of Resentment''.\n\n===Neoconservatism===\nAs a key [[Reagan Administration]] contributor to the formulation of the [[Reagan Doctrine]], Fukuyama is an important figure in the rise of [[neoconservatism]], although his works came out years after [[Irving Kristol]]'s 1972 book crystallized neoconservatism.<ref>[[Irving Kristol]] (1972), ''On the Democratic Idea in America'', New York: Harper.</ref> Fukuyama was active in the [[Project for the New American Century]] think tank starting in 1997, and as a member co-signed the organization's 1998 [[Project for the New American Century#Open letter to President Clinton on Iraq|letter]] recommending that [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] support Iraqi insurgencies in the overthrow of then-President of [[Iraq]] [[Saddam Hussein]].<ref name=PNACClinton>{{cite web| url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909200819/http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm| archivedate=September 9, 2008| title=Letter to President Clinton on Iraq| accessdate=August 16, 2008| author=Abrams, Elliott| date=January 26, 1998| format=PDF| display-authors=etal| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all| author-link=Elliott Abrams}}</ref> He was also among forty co-signers of [[Bill Kristol|William Kristol's]] September 20, 2001 letter to President [[George W.

The best instruments are setting a good example and providing education and, in many cases, money. The secret of development, be it political or economic, is that it never comes from outsiders, but always from people in the country itself. One thing the US proved to have excelled in during the aftermath of [[World War II]] was the formation of international institutions. A return to support for these structures would combine American power with international legitimacy. But such measures require a lot of patience. This is the central thesis of his 2006 work ''[[America at the Crossroads]]''.\n\nIn a 2006 essay in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' strongly critical of the invasion, he identified neoconservatism with [[Leninism]].

It is part of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|2019\u201320 worldwide coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\nPuerto Rico started addressing the risks of an outbreak early on. The island took \"some of the most dramatic steps of any U.S. jurisdiction to control the virus,\" and \"several U.S. cities and states followed Puerto Rico\u2019s lead, imposing curfews and shutting businesses\" of their own.<ref>[https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241295696.html ''Puerto Rico seeks to suspend all incoming flights to battle COVID-19 spread.''] Jim Wyss.

Accessed 17 April 2020.</ref> On February 29, [[Puerto Rico]] governor [[Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced]] established a task force to look into how the virus could affect Puerto Rico and to lay out plans on how to best mitigate any outbreaks. Given the long delays encountered by the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico government]] in obtaining reasonable turnaround from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] test labs in [[Atlanta]] for samples submitted for testing, the Island government took the position that every suspicious case was to be treated as a COVID-19 case until test results were received, and ordered patients to be kept in isolation for 14 days. On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. In Section 6 of the bulletin, the citizens of Puerto Rico were put on a curfew allowing them to travel out of their homes from 5:00 a.m a 9:00 p.m for specific reasons such as to buy medicine, to visit a doctor or pharmacy, to buy groceries, or to care for a sick person. \n\nThe first cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13. They consisted of two Italian tourists and a 71-year-old cancer patient. The governor expressing concern that the curfew established on the 12th was not being followed took stronger actions and asked all non-essential businesses be closed as of March 15 through March 30.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|title=Gobernadora decreta toque de queda por el coronavirus|last=Rivera Clementa|first=Yaritza|date=2020-03-15|website=El Vocero de Puerto Rico|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316013700/https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|archive-date=March 16, 2020|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref><ref name=\"END Toque de Queda\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|title=Wanda V\u00e1zquez decreta toque de queda para todo Puerto Rico para contener el coronavirus [Wanda V\u00e1zquez declares curfew for all of Puerto Rico to contain coronavirus]|date=2020-03-15|website=El Nuevo Dia|language=es-pr|access-date=2020-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320052615/https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|archive-date=March 20, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The first death recorded was that of the 68-year-old Italian woman tourist; a few days later her husband was reported to have recovered from the virus.

Given the long delays encountered by the [[Government of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico government]] in obtaining reasonable turnaround from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] test labs in [[Atlanta]] for samples submitted for testing, the Island government took the position that every suspicious case was to be treated as a COVID-19 case until test results were received, and ordered patients to be kept in isolation for 14 days. On March 12, one day before the first COVID-19 case case was confirmed, the governor declared a state of emergency and activated the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]] to help monitor travelers coming into the Island through its airports and cruise ship docks. In Section 6 of the bulletin, the citizens of Puerto Rico were put on a curfew allowing them to travel out of their homes from 5:00 a.m a 9:00 p.m for specific reasons such as to buy medicine, to visit a doctor or pharmacy, to buy groceries, or to care for a sick person. \n\nThe first cases of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in Puerto Rico were reported on March 13. They consisted of two Italian tourists and a 71-year-old cancer patient. The governor expressing concern that the curfew established on the 12th was not being followed took stronger actions and asked all non-essential businesses be closed as of March 15 through March 30.<ref name=\":7\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|title=Gobernadora decreta toque de queda por el coronavirus|last=Rivera Clementa|first=Yaritza|date=2020-03-15|website=El Vocero de Puerto Rico|language=es|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200316013700/https://www.elvocero.com/gobierno/gobernadora-decreta-toque-de-queda-por-el-coronavirus/article_e8c283a2-66c7-11ea-aea1-03a07fae93f0.html|archive-date=March 16, 2020|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref><ref name=\"END Toque de Queda\">{{cite web|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|title=Wanda V\u00e1zquez decreta toque de queda para todo Puerto Rico para contener el coronavirus [Wanda V\u00e1zquez declares curfew for all of Puerto Rico to contain coronavirus]|date=2020-03-15|website=El Nuevo Dia|language=es-pr|access-date=2020-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320052615/https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/wandavazquezdecretatoquedequedaparatodopuertoricoparacontenerelcoronavirus-2552934/|archive-date=March 20, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The first death recorded was that of the 68-year-old Italian woman tourist; a few days later her husband was reported to have recovered from the virus.
