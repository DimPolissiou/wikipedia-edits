Wise]], who was the [[Governor of Virginia]] at the time.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Cherokee]] conquered the area including Wise from the [[Xualae]] between 1671 and 1685. It was later contested by the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] and the [[Shawnee]]. Cherokee and Shawnee hunting parties fought a protracted battle at the headwaters of the [[Clinch River]] for two days in the summer of 1786, a victory for the Cherokee although losses were heavy on both sides.\n\nThe first white explorers to reach present-day Wise county are said to have been [[Thomas Walker (explorer)|Thomas Walker]] and [[Christopher Gist]], both in 1750. Several forts were built all along the Clinch from 1774 onward, but only after [[Chickamauga Cherokee]] leader [[Bob Benge]] was slain in 1794 was present-day Wise considered safe for white settlers even to hunt in. One of the earliest settlers within the county was William Wells around 1792.<ref>Luther Foster Addison, 1988, ''The Story of Wise County'' p. 1-26</ref>\n\nIn the 1880s, coal deposits became the dominant resource utilized in the area.

Wise]], who was the [[Governor of Virginia]] at the time.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Cherokee]] conquered the area including Wise from the [[Xualae]] between 1671 and 1685. It was later contested by the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] and the [[Shawnee]]. Cherokee and Shawnee hunting parties fought a protracted battle at the headwaters of the [[Clinch River]] for two days in the summer of 1786, a victory for the Cherokee although losses were heavy on both sides.\n\nThe first white explorers to reach present-day Wise county are said to have been [[Thomas Walker (explorer)|Thomas Walker]] and [[Christopher Gist]], both in 1750. Several forts were built all along the Clinch from 1774 onward, but only after [[Chickamauga Cherokee]] leader [[Bob Benge]] was slain in 1794 was present-day Wise considered safe for white settlers even to hunt in. One of the earliest settlers within the county was William Wells around 1792.<ref>Luther Foster Addison, 1988, ''The Story of Wise County'' p. 1-26</ref>\n\nIn the 1880s, coal deposits became the dominant resource utilized in the area.

{"title_page": "Katharina Zell", "text_new": "'''Katharina Sch\u00fctz Zell''' (1497/8 - September 5, 1562) was a [[Protestant]] reformer and writer during the [[Protestant Reformation]].  She was one of the first Protestant women to marry a clergyman.  Katharina lived all of her life in [[Strasbourg]]. Strasbourg was incorporated within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during this time period, but today is located in France close to the border of Germany.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nKatharina Sch\u00fctz Zell was most likely born in early 1498 to Elisabeth Gerster and Jacob Sch\u00fctz in Strasbourg.  She had two older brothers, Jacob and Lux, and two older sisters, Elisabeth and Barbara.  After she was born her parents had five more children, Margaret, Magdalene, Ursula, Andrea, and Jacob. The Sch\u00fctz\u2019s were part of the artistan class, and though not of higher ranks, they were most likely one of Strasbourg\u2019s established families.<ref>Mckee, ''Katharina Sch\u00fctz Zell. The Life and Thought of a Sixteenth-Century Reformer'' pg. 3-7</ref><ref>Introduction to ''Church Mother: The Writings of Protestant Reformer in 16th Century Germany</ref>\n\nKatharina\u2019s family devoted a large portion of their personal finances to the education of their numerous children.  Katharina herself received an excellent vernacular education. The exact form of schooling Katharina received is not clear, but it is clear that she learned to read and write German fluently, and eventually developed some basic knowledge of Latin.  Katharina\u2019s interests in learning were mainly religious, as well as professional training, particularly preparation for an independent profession.<ref>Mckee, ''Katharina Sch\u00fctz Zell. The Life and Thought of a Sixteenth-Century Reformer'' pg. 7-12</ref>  This was also not the end of her education. She took it upon herself to continue independent learning throughout the rest of her life.<ref>Stjerna, ''Women and the Reformation'' pg. 111</ref>\n\n=== Reformation and Partnership ===\nWhen Katharina was still fairly young, the Protestant Reformation was just coming about.  Around this time, the teachings and writings of [[Martin Luther]] gained fame and began to spread.  Katharina was introduced to much of these new teachings and views of religion by Matthew Zell, the pastor who took charge of the St. Lawrence Cathedral in Strasbourg in 1518.  Katharina eventually started to take these beliefs as her own through Zell\u2019s sermons and Luther\u2019s teachings.<ref>Mckee, ''Katharina Sch\u00fctz Zell. The Life and Thought of a Sixteenth-Century Reformer'' pg. 40-41</ref>\n\nA few years after Matthew came to Strasbourg, he and Katharine got married.  They were married by [[Martin Bucer]] at 6:00am on December 3, 1523. The reason behind her marriage was mainly vocational, \u201cKatharina Sch\u00fctz was convinced that she was called to marry Matthew Zell as an expression of her faith in God and her love for others.\u201d<ref>Mckee, ''Katharina Sch\u00fctz Zell. The Life and Thought of a Sixteenth-Century Reformer'' pg. 48-49</ref>  Katharina\u2019s marriage is also interesting because she was one of the first people to marry a pastor, even before the marriage of Martin Luther, something that was not necessarily thought too highly of at the time.  Her marriage was what would be seen as a true equal partnership in a society that required that the good wife be silent and obedient, and in which women usually only achieved independence as widows.<ref>Zell, Mckee, ''Church Mother. The Writings of a Protestant Reformer in Sixteenth-Century Germany'' pg. 1</ref>  Katharina had two children with Matthew, although they both died at very young ages.<ref>Zell, Mckee, ''Church Mother'' pg. 20</ref> Mathew died on January 9, 1548.  Though Katharina mourned and grieved his death, this did not stop her work. She dealt with her grief by intensifying her Bible study.<ref>Zell, Mckee, ''Church Mother'' pg. 76</ref>  Katharina herself became ill in 1561 and died on September 5, 1562.<ref>Mckee, ''Katharina Sch\u00fctz Zell. The Life and Thought of a Sixteenth-Century Reformer'' pg. 222-226</ref>\n\n== Writings and Works ==\n\nKatharina is noted greatly for her writings and unique personal beliefs.  She was very open-minded for a person of her time period and showed it through her actions and writings. Stjerna writes, \u201cShe believed a distinction should be made between people and creeds, the care for the former outweighing disagreements on the latter.\u201d<ref>Stjerna, ''Women and the Reformation'' pg. 116</ref>  Katharina was also aware that as a woman with very strong personal views and values, not all people would be supportive of her. She wrote, \u201cWhat can I do or achieve now that I am a poor woman, who, so many say, should spin and care for the sick \u2026 I am convinced that if I agreed with our preachers in everything I would be called the most pious and knowledgeable woman born in Germany. But since I disagree I am called an arrogant person and, as many say, Doctor Katharina(doctor being a demeaning term implying presumptuousness)\u201d<ref>Zitzlsperger, ''Mother, Martyr and Mary Magdalene'' pg. 388</ref>\n\nOne of Katharina\u2019s titles and occupations was that of a pamphleteer.  Pamphlets were essential for Protestantism during the Reformation.  Zitzlsperger writes \u201cWithout pamphlets the Reformation would arguably not have had the same outcome.<ref>Zitzlsperger, ''Mother, Martyr and Mary Magdalene'' pg. 381</ref>  The pamphlets served to inform a wide audience quickly and with dogmatic effectiveness on current affairs.  Noblewomen of the time would have been most likely in the public eye with their pamphlets much more than Katharina who, as a middle-class woman, tended to be less exposed since she was writing more for her local community.<ref>Zitzlsperger, ''Mother, Martyr and Mary Magdalene'' pg. 381</ref>\n\nAs a woman of this time period, Katharina did face some challenges that the male pamphleteers would not have had. In facing criticism Katharina would remind her criticizers that she never forgot her responsibility as a wife and that she was her husband\u2019s partner. In doing so, Katharina showed his acknowledgment of her important role, and gave value to her personal contributions, \u201cThis is why my pious husband only called me his curate, although I never stood on the pulpit \u2013 something I did not have to do in my line of duties.\u201d<ref>Zitzlsperger, ''Mother, Martyr and Mary Magdalene'' pg.388</ref>\n\nKatharina\u2019s voice was not just heard in Strasbourg.  Martin Luther was personally familiar with her writing, and received a personal copy of Katharina\u2019s first public text, ''Letter to the suffering women of the community of Kentzingen, who believe in Christ, sisters with me in Jesus Christ''.  Katharina also met Martin Luther at some point in her lifetime.<ref>Zell, Mckee, ''Church Mother'' pg.49</ref>\n\nOne of Katharina\u2019s works was a set of books (in four volumes) containing the hymns of the [[Bohemian Brethren]]. In contrast to much of the other work that is known of Katharina, she took almost no part in the writing of the hymns in the book. The book had originally been produced in 1531 by Michael Weisse who gave strict instructions for the actual text of the book to not be altered, though she did add two other hymns. What Katharina did have some control over was the actual music behind the hymns, which went through some major changes by her. It is possible that Katharina had an assistant she relied on for the musical adaptation, though no such assistant is mentioned by her.<ref>McKee, ''Reforming Popular Piety in Sixteenth-century Strasbourg: Katharina Sch\u00fctz Zell and Her Hymnbook'' pg. 19</ref> Katharina's preface to the song book reveals her concern for the spiritual well-being of the laity, especially women:\n\n<blockquote>\"I found such an understanding of the works of God in this songbook that I want all people to understand it. I ought much rather to call it a teaching, prayer, and praise book than a songbook.\"<ref>Early Protestant Spirituality, edited by Scott H. Hendrix</ref></blockquote>\n\nShe considered these Bohemian songs more suitable in subject matter than any liturgical German hymns which had been published in Strasbourg. However, her editions of these books were never reprinted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Singing of the Strasbourg Protestants, 1523-1541|last=Trocm\u00e9-Latter|first=Daniel|publisher=Ashgate|year=2015|isbn=|location=Farnham|pages=124\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nKatharina\u2019s experiences do not reflect those of the majority of women during the Reformation. The work she did was not ordinary of women in this time period.  The Reformation actually produced fewer women writers than the previous medieval period.  Women of this time period were expected to conform to certain roles and rules which were institutionally and socially enforced on them.  Katharina is an example of a woman who broke through these barriers to get her beliefs out to the public.<ref>Stjerna, ''Women and the Reformation'' pg.11-12</ref>  Katharina also differs from some other women reformers in that she was not subject to much threatening opposition. One woman who faced some of this opposition was [[Argula von Grumbach]], another influential pamphleteer.  In response to her public work, theologians from the University of Ingolstadt were \u201cdetermined to have the \u201csilly bag\u201d tamed and punish the \u201cfemale devil.\u201d\u201d<ref>Stjerna, ''Women and the Reformation'' pg.77-78</ref>\n\n== List of writings ==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2017}}\n* ''[https://exhibits2.library.duke.edu/exhibits/show/baskin/item/3939 Letter to the suffering women of the Community of Kentzingen, who believe in Christ, sisters with me in Jesus Christ.]'' ([Augsburg]: [Philip Ulhart], 1524).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Five Hundred Years of Women's Work: The Lisa Unger Baskin Collection (New York and Durham, NC: The Grolier Club and Duke University, 2019, forthcoming via Oak Knoll Books).|last=Nelson, Naomi L., Lauren Reno, and Lisa Unger Baskin [eds.].|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* ''Katharina Sch\u00fctz\u2019s Apologia For Master Matthew Zell, Her Husband, Who is a pastor and servant of the Word of God in Strasbourg, because of the great lies invented about him.''

She was one of the first Protestant women to marry a clergyman.  Katharina lived all of her life in [[Strasbourg]]. Strasbourg was incorporated within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during this time period, but today is located in France close to the border of Germany.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life and education ===\nKatharina Sch\u00fctz Zell was most likely born in early 1498 to Elisabeth Gerster and Jacob Sch\u00fctz in Strasbourg.  She had two older brothers, Jacob and Lux, and two older sisters, Elisabeth and Barbara.  After she was born her parents had five more children, Margaret, Magdalene, Ursula, Andrea, and Jacob. The Sch\u00fctz\u2019s were part of the artistan class, and though not of higher ranks, they were most likely one of Strasbourg\u2019s established families.<ref>Mckee, ''Katharina Sch\u00fctz Zell. The Life and Thought of a Sixteenth-Century Reformer'' pg. 3-7</ref><ref>Introduction to ''Church Mother: The Writings of Protestant Reformer in 16th Century Germany</ref>\n\nKatharina\u2019s family devoted a large portion of their personal finances to the education of their numerous children.  Katharina herself received an excellent vernacular education. The exact form of schooling Katharina received is not clear, but it is clear that she learned to read and write German fluently, and eventually developed some basic knowledge of Latin.  Katharina\u2019s interests in learning were mainly religious, as well as professional training, particularly preparation for an independent profession.<ref>Mckee, ''Katharina Sch\u00fctz Zell. The Life and Thought of a Sixteenth-Century Reformer'' pg. 7-12</ref>  This was also not the end of her education. She took it upon herself to continue independent learning throughout the rest of her life.<ref>Stjerna, ''Women and the Reformation'' pg. 111</ref>\n\n=== Reformation and Partnership ===\nWhen Katharina was still fairly young, the Protestant Reformation was just coming about.  Around this time, the teachings and writings of [[Martin Luther]] gained fame and began to spread.  Katharina was introduced to much of these new teachings and views of religion by Matthew Zell, the pastor who took charge of the St. Lawrence Cathedral in Strasbourg in 1518.  Katharina eventually started to take these beliefs as her own through Zell\u2019s sermons and Luther\u2019s teachings.<ref>Mckee, ''Katharina Sch\u00fctz Zell.
