It is the fifth installment in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, succeeding [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'']]. The game follows the series' traditional style of gameplay: controlling one of the [[Characters in the Super Smash Bros. series|various characters]], players must use differing attacks to weaken their opponents and knock them out of an arena. It features a wide variety of [[game modes]], including a [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] for [[single-player]] and [[multiplayer]] versus modes. ''Ultimate'' features over 80 playable fighters, including everyone from all previous ''Super Smash Bros.'' games, alongside several newcomers. The roster ranges from Nintendo mascots to characters from [[Third party developer|third-party]] franchises, with the game being supported with post-release [[downloadable content]] that adds more.\n\nPlanning for the game had begun by December 2015, with full development starting after the completion of ''3DS''/''Wii U''{{'s}} [[downloadable content]] (DLC). Series creator and director [[Masahiro Sakurai]] returned along with Bandai Namco Studios and Sora, the studios that developed ''3DS''/''Wii U,'' with the return of the studios speeding up the preparation process. Sakurai's goal with ''Ultimate'' was to include every character from previous games despite the various development and licensing problems this would cause. Several well-known video game musicians contributed to the soundtrack, with [[Hideki Sakamoto]] writing the main theme \"Lifelight\".\n\nNintendo teased ''Ultimate'' in a [[Nintendo Direct]] in March 2018 and fully revealed it at [[E3 2018]] the following June. It later received two additional dedicated Nintendo Directs before releasing on December 7, 2018. The game received universal acclaim, with some critics calling it the best of the series. They praised its amount of content and fine-tuning of existing ''Smash'' gameplay elements, although its online mode received some criticism. By December 2019, the game had sold over 17.68 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling fighting game of all time.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Main|Super Smash Bros.#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Super Smash Bros.}}\n[[File:Super Smash Bros.

It is the fifth installment in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, succeeding [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'']]. The game follows the series' traditional style of gameplay: controlling one of the [[Characters in the Super Smash Bros. series|various characters]], players must use differing attacks to weaken their opponents and knock them out of an arena. It features a wide variety of [[game modes]], including a [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] for [[single-player]] and [[multiplayer]] versus modes. ''Ultimate'' features over 80 playable fighters, including everyone from all previous ''Super Smash Bros.'' games, alongside several newcomers. The roster ranges from Nintendo mascots to characters from [[Third party developer|third-party]] franchises, with the game being supported with post-release [[downloadable content]] that adds more.\n\nPlanning for the game had begun by December 2015, with full development starting after the completion of ''3DS''/''Wii U''{{'s}} [[downloadable content]] (DLC). Series creator and director [[Masahiro Sakurai]] returned along with Bandai Namco Studios and Sora, the studios that developed ''3DS''/''Wii U,'' with the return of the studios speeding up the preparation process. Sakurai's goal with ''Ultimate'' was to include every character from previous games despite the various development and licensing problems this would cause. Several well-known video game musicians contributed to the soundtrack, with [[Hideki Sakamoto]] writing the main theme \"Lifelight\".\n\nNintendo teased ''Ultimate'' in a [[Nintendo Direct]] in March 2018 and fully revealed it at [[E3 2018]] the following June. It later received two additional dedicated Nintendo Directs before releasing on December 7, 2018. The game received universal acclaim, with some critics calling it the best of the series. They praised its amount of content and fine-tuning of existing ''Smash'' gameplay elements, although its online mode received some criticism. By December 2019, the game had sold over 17.68 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling fighting game of all time.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Main|Super Smash Bros.#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Super Smash Bros.}}\n[[File:Super Smash Bros.

{"title_page": "Love's Labour's Lost", "text_new": "{{short description|Comedy play by William Shakespeare}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{use British English|date=August 2011}}\n[[Image:Loves labours tp.jpg|thumb|Title page of the first [[quarto]] (1598)]]\n'''''Love's Labour's Lost''''' is one of [[William Shakespeare]]'s early comedies, believed to have been written in the mid-1590s for a performance at the [[Inns of Court]] before [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]. It follows the King of [[Navarre]] and his three companions as they attempt to swear off the company of women for three years in order to focus on study and fasting. Their subsequent infatuation with the Princess of [[France]] and her ladies makes them forsworn. In an untraditional ending for a comedy, the play closes with the death of the Princess's father, and all weddings are delayed for a year. The play draws on themes of masculine love and desire, reckoning and rationalisation, and reality versus fantasy.\n\nThough first published in [[quarto]] in 1598, the play's title page suggests a revision of an earlier version of the play. While there are no obvious sources for the play's plot, the four main characters are loosely based on historical figures. The use of apostrophes in the play's title varies in early editions, though it is most commonly given as ''Love's Labour's Lost''.\n\nShakespeare's audiences were familiar with the historical personages portrayed and the political situation in Europe relating to the setting and action of the play. Scholars suggest the play lost popularity as these historical and political portrayals of Navarre's court became dated and less accessible to theatergoers of later generations. The play's sophisticated wordplay, pedantic humour and dated literary allusions may also be cause for its relative obscurity, as compared with Shakespeare's more popular works.  ''Love's Labour's Lost'' was rarely staged in the 19th century, but it has been seen more often in the 20th and 21st centuries, with productions by both the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] and the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], among others.  It has also been adapted as a musical, an opera, for radio and television and as a [[Love's Labour's Lost (2000 film)|musical film]].\n\n''Love's Labour's Lost'' features the longest scene (5.2), the longest single word '[[honorificabilitudinitatibus]]' (5.1.39\u201340), and (depending on editorial choices) the longest speech (4.3.284\u2013361) in all of Shakespeare's plays (see \"Date and Text\" below).\n\n==Characters==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Ferdinand \u2013 King of [[Navarre]]\n* Lord Berowne (or Biron), Lord Longueville (or Longaville) and Lord Dumaine \u2013 attending on the King\n* Princess of France, later Queen of France\n* Lady Rosaline, Lady Maria, Lady Katharine and Boyet  \u2013 attending on the Princess\n* Marcad\u00e9 \u2013 messenger\n* Don Adriano de Armado \u2013 a fantastical Spaniard\n* Moth \u2013 Armado's [[Page (occupation)|page]]\n* Sir Nathaniel \u2013 [[curate]]\n* Holofernes \u2013 schoolmaster\n* Dull \u2013 [[constable]]\n* [[Costard]] \u2013 a rustic\n* Jaquenetta \u2013 country wench\n* Forester\n* Officers and others, attendants on the King and Princess\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:First-page-first-folio-love's-labors-lost.jpg|thumb|The first page of the play, printed in the [[First Folio]] of 1623.]]\n\nFerdinand, King of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and his three noble companions, the Lords Berowne, Dumaine, and Longaville, take an oath not to give in to the company of women. They devote themselves to three years of study and fasting; Berowne agrees somewhat more hesitantly than the others. The King declares that no woman should come within a mile of the court. Don Adriano de Armado, a Spaniard visiting the court, comes to tell the King of a tryst between [[Costard]] and Jaquenetta. After the King sentences Costard, Don Armado confesses his own love for Jaquenetta to his page, Moth. Don Armado writes Jaquenetta a letter and asks Costard to deliver it.\n\nThe Princess of France and her ladies arrive, wishing to speak to the King regarding the cession of [[Aquitaine]], but must ultimately make their camp outside the court due to the decree. In visiting the Princess and her ladies at their camp, the King falls in love with the Princess, as do the lords with the ladies. Berowne gives Costard a letter to deliver to the lady Rosaline, which Costard switches with Don Armado's letter that was meant for Jaquenetta. Jaquenetta consults two scholars, Holofernes and Sir Nathaniel, who conclude that the letter is written by Berowne and instruct her to tell the King.\n\nThe King and his lords lie in hiding and watch one another as each subsequently reveals their feelings of love. The King ultimately chastises the lords for breaking the oath, but Berowne reveals that the King is likewise in love with the Princess. Jaquenetta and Costard enter with Berowne's letter and accuse him of treason. Berowne confesses to breaking the oath, explaining that the only study worthy of mankind is that of love, and he and the other men collectively decide to relinquish the vow. Arranging for Holofernes to entertain the ladies later, the men then dress as [[Duchy of Moscow|Muscovites]] and court the ladies in disguise. The Queen's courtier Boyet, having overheard their planning, helps the ladies trick the men by disguising themselves as each other. When the lords return as themselves, the ladies taunt them and expose their ruse.\n\nImpressed by the ladies' wit, the men apologize, and when all identities are righted, they watch Holofernes, Sir Nathaniel, Costard, Moth and Don Armado present the [[Nine Worthies]]. The four lords and Boyet heckle the play, saving their sole praise for Costard, and Don Armado and Costard almost come to blows when Costard reveals mid-pageant that Don Armado has got Jaquenetta pregnant. Their spat is interrupted by news that the Princess's father has died. The Princess makes plans to leave at once, and she and her ladies, readying for mourning, declare that the men must wait a year and a day to prove their loves lasting. Don Armado announces he will swear a similar oath to Jaquenetta and then presents the nobles with a song.\n\n==Sources==\n''Love's Labour's Lost'' is, along with Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'', a play without any obvious sources.<ref>Woudhuysen, H.

In the 1623 [[First Folio]] it is ''Loues Labour's Lost'' and in the 1631 edition it is ''Loues Labours Lost''. In the [[Third Folio]] it appears for the first time with the modern punctuation and spelling as ''Love's Labour's Lost''.<ref>J. O.

It has never been among Shakespeare's most popular plays, probably because its pedantic humour and linguistic density are extremely demanding of contemporary theatregoers.<ref name=\"Arden\">{{cite book|last=Woudhuysen|first=H.R.| editor=Proudfoot, Richard|title=The Arden Shakespeare complete works|edition=2|year=2001|publisher=Thomson|location=London| isbn=978-1-903436-61-5|page=743|chapter=Love's Labour's Lost|display-editors=etal}}</ref><ref name=Pendergast/> The satirical allusions of Navarre's court are likewise inaccessible, \"having been principally directed to fashions of language that have long passed away, and [are] consequently little understood, rather than in any great deficiency of invention.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Halliwell-Phillipps|first=J.O.|title=Memoranda on Love's Labour's Lost|year=1879}}</ref>\n\n===Themes===\n\n====Masculine desire====\nMasculine desire structures the play and helps to shape its action. The men's sexual appetite manifests in their desire for fame and honour; the notion of women as dangerous to masculinity and intellect is established early on. The King and his Lords' desires for their idealized women are deferred, confused, and ridiculed throughout the play. As the play comes to a close, their desire is deferred yet again, resulting in an increased exaltation of the women.<ref name=Breitenberg>{{cite journal|last=Breitenberg|first=Mark|title=The Anatomy of Masculine Desire in Love's Labor's Lost|journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|year=1992|volume=43|issue=4|pages=430\u2013449|doi=10.2307/2870863|jstor=2870863}}</ref>\n\nCritic Mark Breitenberg commented that the use of idealistic poetry, popularized by [[Petrarch]], effectively becomes the textualized form of the male gaze.<ref name=Breitenberg/> In describing and idealizing the ladies, the King and his Lords exercise a form of control over women they love. Don Armado also represents masculine desire through his relentless pursuit of Jacquenetta. The theme of desire is heightened by the concern of increasing female sexuality throughout the [[Renaissance]] period and the subsequent threat of [[cuckoldry]]. Politics of love, marriage, and power are equally forceful in shaping the thread of masculine desire that drives the plot.<ref name=Breitenberg/>\n\n====Reckoning and rationalization====\nThe term 'reckoning' is used in its multiple meanings throughout the Shakespeare canon.<ref name=Lewis>{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Cynthia|title='We Know What We Know': Reckoning in Love's Labor's Lost|journal=Studies in Philology|year=2008| volume=105| issue=2| pages=245\u2013264| doi=10.1353/sip.2008.0008}}</ref> In ''Love's Labour's Lost'' in particular, it is often used to signify a moral judgement; most notably, the idea of a final reckoning as it relates to death. Though the play entwines fantasy and reality, the arrival of the messenger to announce the death of the Princess's father ultimately brings this notion to a head. Scholar Cynthia Lewis suggested that the appearance of the final reckoning is necessary in reminding the lovers of the seriousness of marriage.<ref name=Lewis/> The need to settle the disagreement between Navarre and France likewise suggests an instance of reckoning, though this particular reckoning is settled offstage. This is presented in stark contrast to the final scene, in which the act of reckoning cannot be avoided.  In acknowledging the consequences of his actions, Don Armado is the only one to deal with his reckoning in a noble manner. The Lords and the King effectively pass judgement on themselves, revealing their true moral character when mocking the players during the representation of the Nine Worthies.<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nSimilar to reckoning is the notion of rationalization, which provides the basis for the swift change in the ladies' feelings for the men. The ladies are able to talk themselves into falling in love with the men due to the rationalization of the men's purported flaws. Lewis concluded that \"the proclivity to rationalize a position, a like, or a dislike, is linked in ''Love's Labour's Lost'' with the difficulty of reckoning absolute value, whose slipperiness is indicated throughout the play.\"<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n====Reality versus fantasy====\nCritic Joseph Westlund wrote that ''Love's Labour's Lost'' functions as a \"prelude to the more extensive commentary on imagination in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.\"<ref name=Westlund>{{cite journal|last=Westlund|first=Joseph|title=Fancy and Achievement in Love's Labor's Lost|journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|year=1967|volume=18|issue=1|pages=37\u201346|doi=10.2307/2868061|jstor=2868061}}</ref> There are several plot points driven by fantasy and imagination throughout the play. The Lords and the King's declaration of abstinence is a fancy that falls short of achievement. This fantasy rests on the men's idea that the resulting fame will allow them to circumvent death and oblivion, a fantastical notion itself. Within moments of swearing their oath, it becomes clear that their fantastical goal is unachievable given the reality of the world, the unnatural state of abstinence itself, and the arrival of the Princess and her ladies. This juxtaposition ultimately lends itself to the irony and humour in the play.<ref name=Westlund/>\n\nThe commoners represent the theme of reality and achievement versus fantasy via their production regarding the Nine Worthies. Like the men's fantastical pursuit of fame, the play within a play represents the commoners' concern with fame. The relationship between the fantasy of love and the reality of worthwhile achievement, a popular Renaissance topic, is also utilized throughout the play. Don Armado attempts to reconcile these opposite desires using Worthies who fell in love as model examples.<ref name=Westlund/> Time is suspended throughout the play and is of little substance to the plot. The Princess, though originally \"craving quick dispatch,\" quickly falls under the spell of love and abandons her urgent business. This suggests that the majority of the action takes place within a fantasy world. Only with the news of the Princess's father's death are time and reality reawakened.<ref name=Westlund/>\n\n===Music===\nUnlike many of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, music plays a role only in the final scene of ''Love's Labour's Lost''. The songs of spring and winter, titled \"Ver and Hiems\" and \"The Cuckoo and the Owl\", respectively, occur near the end of the play. Given the critical controversy regarding the exact dating of ''Love's Labour's Lost'', there is some indication that \"the songs belong to the 1597 additions.\"<ref name=McLay>{{cite journal|last=McLay|first=Catherine|title=The Dialogues of Spring and Winter: A Key to the Unity of ''Love's Labour's Lost''|journal=[[Shakespeare Quarterly]]|year=1967| volume=18|issue=2| pages=119\u2013127|doi=10.2307/2867698|jstor=2867698}}</ref>\n\nDifferent interpretations of the meaning of these songs include: optimistic commentary for the future, bleak commentary regarding the recent announcement of death, or an ironic device by which to direct the King and his Lords towards a new outlook on love and life.<ref name=Berger>{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=Thomas|title=The Lack of Song in Love's Labor's Lost|journal=[[Shakespeare Quarterly]]|year=1975|volume=26|issue=1|pages=53\u201355|doi=10.2307/2869270|jstor=2869270}}</ref> In keeping with the theme of time as it relates to reality and fantasy, these are seasonal songs that restore the sense of time to the play. Due to the opposing nature of the two songs, they can be viewed as a debate on the opposing attitudes on love found throughout the play.<ref name=Westlund/> Catherine McLay comments that the songs are functional in their interpretation of the central themes in ''Love's Labour's Lost''.<ref name=McLay/>  McLay also suggests that the songs negate what many consider to be a \"heretical\" ending for a comedy. The songs, a product of traditional comedic structure, are a method by which the play can be \"[brought] within the periphery of the usual comic definition.\"<ref name=McLay/>\n\nCritic Thomas Berger states that, regardless of the meaning of these final songs, they are important in their contrast with the lack of song throughout the rest of the play.<ref name=Berger/> In cutting themselves off from women and the possibility of love, the King and his Lords have effectively cut themselves off from song. Song is allowed into the world of the play at the beginning of Act III, after the Princess and her ladies have been introduced and the men begin to fall in love. Moth\u2019s song \"Concolinel\" indicates that the vows will be broken.<ref name=Berger/>  In Act I, Scene II, Moth recites a poem but fails to sing it.

It follows the King of [[Navarre]] and his three companions as they attempt to swear off the company of women for three years in order to focus on study and fasting. Their subsequent infatuation with the Princess of [[France]] and her ladies makes them forsworn. In an untraditional ending for a comedy, the play closes with the death of the Princess's father, and all weddings are delayed for a year. The play draws on themes of masculine love and desire, reckoning and rationalisation, and reality versus fantasy.\n\nThough first published in [[quarto]] in 1598, the play's title page suggests a revision of an earlier version of the play. While there are no obvious sources for the play's plot, the four main characters are loosely based on historical figures. The use of apostrophes in the play's title varies in early editions, though it is most commonly given as ''Love's Labour's Lost''.\n\nShakespeare's audiences were familiar with the historical personages portrayed and the political situation in Europe relating to the setting and action of the play. Scholars suggest the play lost popularity as these historical and political portrayals of Navarre's court became dated and less accessible to theatergoers of later generations. The play's sophisticated wordplay, pedantic humour and dated literary allusions may also be cause for its relative obscurity, as compared with Shakespeare's more popular works.  ''Love's Labour's Lost'' was rarely staged in the 19th century, but it has been seen more often in the 20th and 21st centuries, with productions by both the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] and the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], among others.  It has also been adapted as a musical, an opera, for radio and television and as a [[Love's Labour's Lost (2000 film)|musical film]].\n\n''Love's Labour's Lost'' features the longest scene (5.2), the longest single word '[[honorificabilitudinitatibus]]' (5.1.39\u201340), and (depending on editorial choices) the longest speech (4.3.284\u2013361) in all of Shakespeare's plays (see \"Date and Text\" below).\n\n==Characters==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Ferdinand \u2013 King of [[Navarre]]\n* Lord Berowne (or Biron), Lord Longueville (or Longaville) and Lord Dumaine \u2013 attending on the King\n* Princess of France, later Queen of France\n* Lady Rosaline, Lady Maria, Lady Katharine and Boyet  \u2013 attending on the Princess\n* Marcad\u00e9 \u2013 messenger\n* Don Adriano de Armado \u2013 a fantastical Spaniard\n* Moth \u2013 Armado's [[Page (occupation)|page]]\n* Sir Nathaniel \u2013 [[curate]]\n* Holofernes \u2013 schoolmaster\n* Dull \u2013 [[constable]]\n* [[Costard]] \u2013 a rustic\n* Jaquenetta \u2013 country wench\n* Forester\n* Officers and others, attendants on the King and Princess\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:First-page-first-folio-love's-labors-lost.jpg|thumb|The first page of the play, printed in the [[First Folio]] of 1623.]]\n\nFerdinand, King of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and his three noble companions, the Lords Berowne, Dumaine, and Longaville, take an oath not to give in to the company of women. They devote themselves to three years of study and fasting; Berowne agrees somewhat more hesitantly than the others. The King declares that no woman should come within a mile of the court. Don Adriano de Armado, a Spaniard visiting the court, comes to tell the King of a tryst between [[Costard]] and Jaquenetta. After the King sentences Costard, Don Armado confesses his own love for Jaquenetta to his page, Moth. Don Armado writes Jaquenetta a letter and asks Costard to deliver it.\n\nThe Princess of France and her ladies arrive, wishing to speak to the King regarding the cession of [[Aquitaine]], but must ultimately make their camp outside the court due to the decree. In visiting the Princess and her ladies at their camp, the King falls in love with the Princess, as do the lords with the ladies. Berowne gives Costard a letter to deliver to the lady Rosaline, which Costard switches with Don Armado's letter that was meant for Jaquenetta. Jaquenetta consults two scholars, Holofernes and Sir Nathaniel, who conclude that the letter is written by Berowne and instruct her to tell the King.\n\nThe King and his lords lie in hiding and watch one another as each subsequently reveals their feelings of love. The King ultimately chastises the lords for breaking the oath, but Berowne reveals that the King is likewise in love with the Princess. Jaquenetta and Costard enter with Berowne's letter and accuse him of treason. Berowne confesses to breaking the oath, explaining that the only study worthy of mankind is that of love, and he and the other men collectively decide to relinquish the vow. Arranging for Holofernes to entertain the ladies later, the men then dress as [[Duchy of Moscow|Muscovites]] and court the ladies in disguise. The Queen's courtier Boyet, having overheard their planning, helps the ladies trick the men by disguising themselves as each other. When the lords return as themselves, the ladies taunt them and expose their ruse.\n\nImpressed by the ladies' wit, the men apologize, and when all identities are righted, they watch Holofernes, Sir Nathaniel, Costard, Moth and Don Armado present the [[Nine Worthies]]. The four lords and Boyet heckle the play, saving their sole praise for Costard, and Don Armado and Costard almost come to blows when Costard reveals mid-pageant that Don Armado has got Jaquenetta pregnant. Their spat is interrupted by news that the Princess's father has died. The Princess makes plans to leave at once, and she and her ladies, readying for mourning, declare that the men must wait a year and a day to prove their loves lasting. Don Armado announces he will swear a similar oath to Jaquenetta and then presents the nobles with a song.\n\n==Sources==\n''Love's Labour's Lost'' is, along with Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'', a play without any obvious sources.<ref>Woudhuysen, H.

The men's sexual appetite manifests in their desire for fame and honour; the notion of women as dangerous to masculinity and intellect is established early on. The King and his Lords' desires for their idealized women are deferred, confused, and ridiculed throughout the play. As the play comes to a close, their desire is deferred yet again, resulting in an increased exaltation of the women.<ref name=Breitenberg>{{cite journal|last=Breitenberg|first=Mark|title=The Anatomy of Masculine Desire in Love's Labor's Lost|journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|year=1992|volume=43|issue=4|pages=430\u2013449|doi=10.2307/2870863|jstor=2870863}}</ref>\n\nCritic Mark Breitenberg commented that the use of idealistic poetry, popularized by [[Petrarch]], effectively becomes the textualized form of the male gaze.<ref name=Breitenberg/> In describing and idealizing the ladies, the King and his Lords exercise a form of control over women they love. Don Armado also represents masculine desire through his relentless pursuit of Jacquenetta. The theme of desire is heightened by the concern of increasing female sexuality throughout the [[Renaissance]] period and the subsequent threat of [[cuckoldry]]. Politics of love, marriage, and power are equally forceful in shaping the thread of masculine desire that drives the plot.<ref name=Breitenberg/>\n\n====Reckoning and rationalization====\nThe term 'reckoning' is used in its multiple meanings throughout the Shakespeare canon.<ref name=Lewis>{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Cynthia|title='We Know What We Know': Reckoning in Love's Labor's Lost|journal=Studies in Philology|year=2008| volume=105| issue=2| pages=245\u2013264| doi=10.1353/sip.2008.0008}}</ref> In ''Love's Labour's Lost'' in particular, it is often used to signify a moral judgement; most notably, the idea of a final reckoning as it relates to death. Though the play entwines fantasy and reality, the arrival of the messenger to announce the death of the Princess's father ultimately brings this notion to a head. Scholar Cynthia Lewis suggested that the appearance of the final reckoning is necessary in reminding the lovers of the seriousness of marriage.<ref name=Lewis/> The need to settle the disagreement between Navarre and France likewise suggests an instance of reckoning, though this particular reckoning is settled offstage. This is presented in stark contrast to the final scene, in which the act of reckoning cannot be avoided.  In acknowledging the consequences of his actions, Don Armado is the only one to deal with his reckoning in a noble manner. The Lords and the King effectively pass judgement on themselves, revealing their true moral character when mocking the players during the representation of the Nine Worthies.<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nSimilar to reckoning is the notion of rationalization, which provides the basis for the swift change in the ladies' feelings for the men. The ladies are able to talk themselves into falling in love with the men due to the rationalization of the men's purported flaws. Lewis concluded that \"the proclivity to rationalize a position, a like, or a dislike, is linked in ''Love's Labour's Lost'' with the difficulty of reckoning absolute value, whose slipperiness is indicated throughout the play.\"<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n====Reality versus fantasy====\nCritic Joseph Westlund wrote that ''Love's Labour's Lost'' functions as a \"prelude to the more extensive commentary on imagination in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.\"<ref name=Westlund>{{cite journal|last=Westlund|first=Joseph|title=Fancy and Achievement in Love's Labor's Lost|journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|year=1967|volume=18|issue=1|pages=37\u201346|doi=10.2307/2868061|jstor=2868061}}</ref> There are several plot points driven by fantasy and imagination throughout the play. The Lords and the King's declaration of abstinence is a fancy that falls short of achievement. This fantasy rests on the men's idea that the resulting fame will allow them to circumvent death and oblivion, a fantastical notion itself. Within moments of swearing their oath, it becomes clear that their fantastical goal is unachievable given the reality of the world, the unnatural state of abstinence itself, and the arrival of the Princess and her ladies. This juxtaposition ultimately lends itself to the irony and humour in the play.<ref name=Westlund/>\n\nThe commoners represent the theme of reality and achievement versus fantasy via their production regarding the Nine Worthies. Like the men's fantastical pursuit of fame, the play within a play represents the commoners' concern with fame. The relationship between the fantasy of love and the reality of worthwhile achievement, a popular Renaissance topic, is also utilized throughout the play. Don Armado attempts to reconcile these opposite desires using Worthies who fell in love as model examples.<ref name=Westlund/> Time is suspended throughout the play and is of little substance to the plot. The Princess, though originally \"craving quick dispatch,\" quickly falls under the spell of love and abandons her urgent business. This suggests that the majority of the action takes place within a fantasy world. Only with the news of the Princess's father's death are time and reality reawakened.<ref name=Westlund/>\n\n===Music===\nUnlike many of Shakespeare\u2019s plays, music plays a role only in the final scene of ''Love's Labour's Lost''. The songs of spring and winter, titled \"Ver and Hiems\" and \"The Cuckoo and the Owl\", respectively, occur near the end of the play. Given the critical controversy regarding the exact dating of ''Love's Labour's Lost'', there is some indication that \"the songs belong to the 1597 additions.\"<ref name=McLay>{{cite journal|last=McLay|first=Catherine|title=The Dialogues of Spring and Winter: A Key to the Unity of ''Love's Labour's Lost''|journal=[[Shakespeare Quarterly]]|year=1967| volume=18|issue=2| pages=119\u2013127|doi=10.2307/2867698|jstor=2867698}}</ref>\n\nDifferent interpretations of the meaning of these songs include: optimistic commentary for the future, bleak commentary regarding the recent announcement of death, or an ironic device by which to direct the King and his Lords towards a new outlook on love and life.<ref name=Berger>{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=Thomas|title=The Lack of Song in Love's Labor's Lost|journal=[[Shakespeare Quarterly]]|year=1975|volume=26|issue=1|pages=53\u201355|doi=10.2307/2869270|jstor=2869270}}</ref> In keeping with the theme of time as it relates to reality and fantasy, these are seasonal songs that restore the sense of time to the play. Due to the opposing nature of the two songs, they can be viewed as a debate on the opposing attitudes on love found throughout the play.<ref name=Westlund/> Catherine McLay comments that the songs are functional in their interpretation of the central themes in ''Love's Labour's Lost''.<ref name=McLay/>  McLay also suggests that the songs negate what many consider to be a \"heretical\" ending for a comedy. The songs, a product of traditional comedic structure, are a method by which the play can be \"[brought] within the periphery of the usual comic definition.\"<ref name=McLay/>\n\nCritic Thomas Berger states that, regardless of the meaning of these final songs, they are important in their contrast with the lack of song throughout the rest of the play.<ref name=Berger/> In cutting themselves off from women and the possibility of love, the King and his Lords have effectively cut themselves off from song. Song is allowed into the world of the play at the beginning of Act III, after the Princess and her ladies have been introduced and the men begin to fall in love. Moth\u2019s song \"Concolinel\" indicates that the vows will be broken.<ref name=Berger/>  In Act I, Scene II, Moth recites a poem but fails to sing it. Don Armado insists that Moth sing it twice, but he does not. Berger infers that a song was intended to be inserted at this point, but was never written. Had a song been inserted at this point of the play, it would have followed dramatic convention of the time, which often called for music between scenes.<ref name=Berger/>\n\n==Performance history==\n[[File:John Drew as the King of Navarre.jpg|thumb|left|A photograph of [[John Drew, Jr.|John Drew]] as the King of Navarre in [[Augustin Daly]]'s production.]]\nThe earliest recorded performance of the play occurred at Christmas in 1597 at the Court before Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]].

According to an entry<ref name=\"epsilon\" /> in the [[Suda]] (a 10th-century encyclopedia), his critics scorned him, calling him ''Beta'' (the second letter of the Greek alphabet) because he always came in second in all his endeavors.<ref name=\"asimov\" /> Nonetheless, his devotees nicknamed him ''Pentathlos'' after the Olympians who were well rounded competitors, for he had proven himself to be knowledgeable in every area of learning. Eratosthenes yearned to understand the complexities of the entire world.<ref name=\"chambers\" />\n\n== Life ==\nThe son of Aglaos, Eratosthenes was born in 276 BC in [[Cyrene (city)|Cyrene]]. Now part of modern-day [[Libya]], Cyrene had been founded by Greeks centuries earlier and became the capital of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)]], a country of five cities: Cyrene, Arsinoe, [[Berenice]], Ptolemias, and [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia]]. [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Cyrene in 332 BC, and following his death in 323 BC, its rule was given to one of his generals, [[Ptolemy I Soter]], the founder of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. Under Ptolemaic rule the economy prospered, based largely on the export of horses and [[silphium]], a plant used for rich seasoning and medicine.<ref name=\"roller\"/> Cyrene became a place of cultivation, where knowledge blossomed. Like any young Greek at the time, Eratosthenes would have studied in the local [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], where he would have learned physical skills and social discourse as well as reading, writing, arithmetic, poetry, and music.<ref name=\"bailey\" />\n[[File:Eratosthenes Teaching in Alexandria (Bernardo Strozzi, Montreal).jpg|thumb|''Eratosthenes teaching in Alexandria'' by [[Bernardo Strozzi]] (1635)]]\n\nEratosthenes went to Athens to further his studies. There he was taught [[Stoicism]] by its founder, [[Zeno of Citium]], in philosophical lectures on living a virtuous life.<ref name=\"rist\" /> He then studied under [[Aristo of Chios]], who led a more [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynical]] school of philosophy. He also studied under the head of the [[Platonic Academy]], who was [[Arcesilaus of Pitane]]. His interest in Plato led him to write his very first work at a scholarly level, ''Platonikos'', inquiring into the mathematical foundation of Plato's philosophies.<ref name=\"chambers\" /> Eratosthenes was a man of many perspectives and investigated the art of poetry under [[Callimachus]].<ref name=\"bailey\" /> He wrote poems: one in [[hexameter]]s called ''Hermes'', illustrating the god's life history; and another in [[elegiac | elegiacs]], called ''Erigone'', describing the suicide of the Athenian maiden [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)]].<ref name=\"chambers\" /> He wrote ''Chronographies'', a text that scientifically depicted dates of importance, beginning with the [[Trojan War]]. This work was highly esteemed for its accuracy. [[George Syncellus]] was later able to preserve from ''Chronographies'' a list of 38 kings of the [[Egyptian Thebes]]. Eratosthenes also wrote ''Olympic Victors'', a chronology of the winners of the Olympic Games. It is not known when he wrote his works, but they highlighted his abilities.\n\nThese works and his great poetic abilities led the pharaoh [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] to seek to place him as a librarian at the [[Library of Alexandria]] in the year 245 BC. Eratosthenes, then thirty years old, accepted Ptolemy's invitation and traveled to Alexandria, where he lived for the rest of his life. Within about five years he became Chief Librarian, a position that the poet [[Apollonius Rhodius]] had previously held. As head of the library Eratosthenes tutored the children of Ptolemy, including [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] who became the fourth Ptolemaic pharaoh. He expanded the library's holdings: in Alexandria all books had to be surrendered for duplication. It was said that these were copied so accurately that it was impossible to tell if the library had returned the original or the copy.\nHe sought to maintain the reputation of the Library of Alexandria against competition from the [[Library of Pergamum]]. Eratosthenes created a whole section devoted to the examination of Homer, and acquired original works of great tragic dramas of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]].<ref name=\"chambers\" />\n\nEratosthenes made several important contributions to [[mathematics]] and [[science]], and was a friend of [[Archimedes]]. Around 255&nbsp;BC, he invented the [[armillary sphere]]. In ''On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies'', [[Cleomedes]] credited him with having calculated the [[Earth's circumference]] around 240 BC, with a high precision.<ref name=\"russo273277\" />\n\nEratosthenes believed there was both good and bad in every nation and criticized [[Aristotle]] for arguing that humanity was divided into Greeks and [[barbarian]]s, as well as for arguing that the Greeks should keep themselves racially pure.<ref name=\"alexander\" /> As he aged he contracted [[ophthalmia]], becoming blind around 195 BC. Losing the ability to read and to observe nature plagued and depressed him, leading him to voluntarily starve himself to death. He died in 194&nbsp;BC at 82 in Alexandria.<ref name=\"bailey\" />\n\n== Scholarly career ==\n=== Measurement of the Earth's circumference ===\n<!--[[History of physics]] links here -->\n\nThe measure of [[Earth's circumference]] is the most famous among the results obtained by Eratosthenes,<ref>{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Lucio |author-link=Lucio Russo |date=2004 |title=The Forgotten Revolution |url= |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |page=68}}.</ref>  who estimated that the meridian has a length of 252,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]], with an error on the real value between -2.4% and +0.8% (assuming a value for the stadion between 155 and 160 metres).<ref name=\"russo273277\" /> Eratosthenes described his technique in a book entitled ''On the measure of the Earth'', which has not been preserved.\n\n==== Cleomedes' simplified version ====\n[[File:Eratostene--Calcolo Raggio Terrestre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Measure of Earth's circumference according to Cleomedes' simplified version, based on the wrong assumption that [[Syene]] is on the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and on the same meridian as [[Alexandria]]]]\n\nEratosthenes' method to calculate the [[Earth's circumference]] has been lost; what has been preserved is the simplified version described by [[Cleomedes]] to popularise the discovery.<ref>Cleomedes, ''Caelestia'', i.7.49-52.</ref> Cleomedes invites his reader to consider two Egyptian cities, [[Alexandria]] and [[Syene]], modern [[Assuan]]:\n# Cleomedes assumes that the distance between Syene and Alexandria was 5,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]] (a figure that was checked yearly by professional [[bematist]]s, ''mensores regii'');<ref>Martianus Capella, ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'', VI.598.</ref> \n# he assumes the simplified (but false) hypothesis that Syene was precisely on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], saying that at [[Solar noon|local noon]] on the summer [[solstice]] the Sun was directly overhead;<ref name=\"pillar\" />\n# he assumes the simplified (but false) hypothesis that Syene and Alexandria are on the same meridian.\n\nUnder the previous assumptions, says Cleomedes, you can measure the Sun's angle of elevation at noon of the summer solstice in Alexandria, by using a vertical rod (a [[gnomon]]) of known length and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground;<ref name=\"bucknell\" /> it is then possible to calculated the angle of the Sun's rays,<ref name=\"anthony\" /> which he claims to be about 7\u00b0, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle. Taking the Earth as spherical, the Earth's circumference would be fifty times the distance between Alexandria and Syene, that is 250,000 stadia. Since 1 Egyptian stadium is equal to 157.5 metres, the result is 39,375&nbsp;km, which is 1.4% less than the real number, 39,941&nbsp;km.\n\n==== Eratosthenes' method ====\n\nEratosthenes' method was actually more complicated, as stated by the same Cleomedes, whose purpose was to present a simplified version of the one described in Eratosthenes' book. The method was based on several [[surveying]] trips conducted by professional [[bematist]]s, whose job was to precisely measure the extent of the territory of Egypt for agricultural and taxation-related purposes.<ref name=\"russo273277\">{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Lucio |author-link=Lucio Russo |date=2004 |title=The Forgotten Revolution |url= |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer|page=273-277}}</ref> Furthermore, the fact that Eratosthenes' measure corresponds precisely to 252,000 stadia might be intentional, since it is a number that can be divided by all natural numbers from 1 to 10: some historians believe that Eratosthenes changed from the 250,000 value written by Cleomedes to this new value to simply calculations;<ref>{{cite journal |first=Dennis |last=Rawlins |title=The Erathostenes-Strabo Nile Map.

Using his discoveries and knowledge of its size and shape, he began to sketch it. In the Library of Alexandria he had access to various travel books, which contained various items of information and representations of the world that needed to be pieced together in some organized format.<ref name=\"Smith2005\" /> In his three-volume work ''Geography'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Geographika|script=Latn}}), he described and mapped his entire known world, even dividing the Earth into five climate zones:<ref name=\"Morris\" /> two freezing zones around the poles, two temperate zones, and a zone encompassing the equator and the tropics.<ref name=\"Hutchinson\" /> He had invented geography. He created terminology that is still used today. He placed grids of overlapping lines over the surface of the Earth. He used parallels and meridians to link together every place in the world. It was now possible to estimate one's distance from remote locations with this network over the surface of the Earth. In the ''Geography'' the names of over 400 cities and their locations were shown: this had never been achieved before.<ref name=\"roller\"/>  Unfortunately, his ''Geography'' has been lost to history, but fragments of the work can be pieced together from other great historians like [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Polybius]], [[Strabo]], and [[Marcianus]].\n* The first book was something of an introduction and gave a review of his predecessors, recognizing their contributions that he compiled in the library. In this book Eratosthenes denounced [[Homer]] as not providing any insight into what he now described as geography. His disapproval of Homer's topography angered many who believed the world depicted in the ''Odyssey'' to be legitimate.<ref name=\"chambers\"/><ref name=\"Eckerman\" /> He also commented on the ideas of the nature and origin of the Earth: he had thought of Earth as an immovable globe; while on its surface was a place that was changing. He had hypothesized that at one time the [[Mediterranean]] was a vast lake that covered the countries that surrounded it; and had only become connected to the ocean to the west when a passage had opened up sometime in its history.\n* In the second book is his discovery about the circumference of the Earth. This is where, according to Pliny, \"The world was grasped.\" Here Eratosthenes described his famous story of the well in Syene, wherein at noon each summer solstice, the Sun's rays shone straight down into the city-center well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/big-history-project/solar-system-and-earth/knowing-solar-system-earth/a/eratosthenes-of-cyrene|title=Eratosthenes of Cyrene|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> This book would now be considered a text on [[mathematical geography]].\n* His third book of the ''Geography'' contained [[political geography]]. He cited countries and used parallel lines to divide the map into sections, to give accurate descriptions of the realms. This was a breakthrough, and can be considered the beginning of geography. For this, Eratosthenes was named the \"Father of Modern Geography.\"<ref name=\"Smith2005\" />\n\n===  Achievements ===\nEratosthenes was described by the [[Suda Lexicon]] as a \u03a0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (Pentathlos) which can be translated as \"All-Rounder\", for he was skilled in a variety of things: He was a true polymath. He was nicknamed Beta because he was great at many things and tried to get his hands on every bit of information but never achieved the highest rank in anything; [[Strabo]] accounts Eratosthenes as a mathematician among geographers and a geographer among mathematicians.<ref name=\"Dicks1971\" />\n* [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his ''[[Preparation for the Gospel|Preparatio Evangelica]]'' includes a brief chapter of three sentences on celestial distances ([http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_15_book15.htm Book XV], Chapter 53). He states simply that Eratosthenes found the distance to the Sun to be \"{{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f40\u03ba\u03c4\u03c9\u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}\" (literally \"of [[Stadia (length)|stadia]] [[myriad]]s 400 and 80,000\") and the distance to the Moon to be 780,000 stadia. The expression for the distance to the Sun has been translated either as 4,080,000 stadia (1903 translation by E. H. Gifford), or as 804,000,000 stadia (edition of Edouard des Places, dated 1974\u20131991). The meaning depends on whether Eusebius meant 400 myriad plus 80,000 or \"400 and 80,000\" myriad. With a stade of {{cvt|185|m|||}}, 804,000,000 stadia is {{cvt|149000000|km|||}}, approximately the distance from the Earth to the Sun.\n* Eratosthenes also calculated the Sun's diameter. According to Macrobious, Eratosthenes made the diameter of the Sun to be about 27 times that of the Earth.<ref name=\"Smith2005\" /> The actual figure is approximately 109 times.<ref name=\"caltech\" />\n* During his time at the Library of Alexandria, Eratosthenes devised a calendar using his predictions about the [[ecliptic]] of the Earth. He calculated that there are 365 days in a year and that every fourth year there would be 366 days.<ref name=\"manawatu\" />\n* He was also very proud of his solution for [[Doubling the Cube]]. His motivation was that he wanted to produce catapults. Eratosthenes constructed a mechanical line drawing device to calculate the cube, called the mesolabio. He dedicated his solution to King Ptolemy, presenting a model in bronze with it a letter and an epigram.<ref name=\"zhumud\" /> Archimedes was Eratosthenes' friend and he, too, worked on the war instrument with mathematics. Archimedes dedicated his book ''The Method'' to Eratosthenes, knowing his love for learning and mathematics.<ref name=\"chondros\" />\n\n===Number theory===\n[[File:Sieve of Eratosthenes animation.gif|right|frame|Sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm steps for primes below 121 (including optimization of starting from the prime's square).]]\n{{Main|Sieve of Eratosthenes|primality test}}\n\nEratosthenes proposed a simple [[algorithm]] for finding [[prime numbers]]. This algorithm is known in mathematics as the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]].\n\nIn mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes (Greek: \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f18\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2), one of a number of [[Generating primes#Prime sieves|prime number sieves]], is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite, ''i.e.'', not prime, the multiples of each prime, starting with the multiples of 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated starting from that prime, as a sequence of numbers with the same difference, equal to that prime, between consecutive numbers. This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime.\n\n== Works ==\nEratosthenes was one of the most pre-eminent scholarly figures of his time, and produced works covering a vast area of knowledge before and during his time at the Library. He wrote on many topics&nbsp;\u2014 geography, mathematics, philosophy, chronology, literary criticism, grammar, poetry, and even old comedies. Unfortunately, there are only fragments left of his works after the [[destruction of the Library of Alexandria]].<ref name=\"Dicks1971\" />\n\n===Titles===\n* ''Platonikos''\n* ''Hermes''\n* ''Erigone''\n* ''Chronographies''\n* ''Olympic Victors''\n* ''\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2'' (''On the Measurement of the Earth'')<ref name=\"hero\" /> (lost, summarized by [[Cleomedes]])\n* ''\u0413\u03b5\u03c9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03d5\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac'' (''Geographika'')<ref name=\"Dicks1971\"/> (lost, criticized by [[Strabo]])\n* ''Arsinoe'' (a memoir of queen [[Arsinoe III of Egypt|Arsinoe]]; lost; quoted by [[Athenaeus]] in the ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'')\n* ''Ariston'' (concerning [[Aristo of Chios]]' addiction to luxury); lost; quoted by [[Athenaeus]] in the ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'')<ref name=\"ASmith\" />\n* A fragmentary collection of [[Hellenistic]] myths about the [[constellation]]s, called ''[[Catasterismi]]'' (''Katasterismoi''), was attributed to Eratosthenes, perhaps to add to its credibility.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eratosthenes (crater)]] on the [[Moon]]\n* [[Eratosthenian]] period in the [[lunar geologic timescale]]\n* [[Eratosthenes Seamount]] in the eastern Mediterranean Sea\n* [[Posidonius]], another Greek philosopher who calculated the circumference of the Earth\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot\n|notes =\n{{NoteTag|name=birth|The [[Suda]] states that he was born in the 126th [[Olympiad]], (276\u2013272&nbsp;BC).

He was a man of learning, becoming the chief librarian at the [[Library of Alexandria]]. His work is comparable to what is now known as the study of [[geography]], and he introduced some of the terminology still used today.<ref name=\"roller\" />\n\nHe is best known for being the first person to calculate the [[History of geodesy#Hellenic world|circumference of the Earth]], which he did by using the extensive survey results he could access in his role at the Library; his calculation was remarkably accurate.<ref name=\"russo273277\" /> He was also the first to calculate the [[Axial tilt#Obliquity of the ecliptic (Earth's axial tilt)|tilt of the Earth's axis]], once again with remarkable accuracy.<ref name=\"cornell\" /> Additionally, he may have accurately calculated the [[Astronomical unit|distance from the Earth to the Sun]] and invented the [[leap day]].<ref name=\"wired\" /> He created the first [[Ancient world maps#Eratosthenes (276\u2013194 BCE)|global projection of the world]], incorporating [[Circle of latitude|parallels]] and [[Longitude|meridians]] based on the available geographic knowledge of his era.\n\nEratosthenes was the founder of scientific [[chronology]]; he endeavoured to revise the dates of the chief literary and political events from the conquest of [[Troy]]. Eratosthenes dated [[Trojan War|The Sack of Troy]] to 1183 BC. In [[number theory]], he introduced the [[sieve of Eratosthenes]], an efficient method of identifying [[prime number | prime numbers]].\n\nHe was a figure of influence in many fields.  According to an entry<ref name=\"epsilon\" /> in the [[Suda]] (a 10th-century encyclopedia), his critics scorned him, calling him ''Beta'' (the second letter of the Greek alphabet) because he always came in second in all his endeavors.<ref name=\"asimov\" /> Nonetheless, his devotees nicknamed him ''Pentathlos'' after the Olympians who were well rounded competitors, for he had proven himself to be knowledgeable in every area of learning. Eratosthenes yearned to understand the complexities of the entire world.<ref name=\"chambers\" />\n\n== Life ==\nThe son of Aglaos, Eratosthenes was born in 276 BC in [[Cyrene (city)|Cyrene]]. Now part of modern-day [[Libya]], Cyrene had been founded by Greeks centuries earlier and became the capital of [[Pentapolis (North Africa)]], a country of five cities: Cyrene, Arsinoe, [[Berenice]], Ptolemias, and [[Apollonia, Cyrenaica|Apollonia]]. [[Alexander the Great]] conquered Cyrene in 332 BC, and following his death in 323 BC, its rule was given to one of his generals, [[Ptolemy I Soter]], the founder of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. Under Ptolemaic rule the economy prospered, based largely on the export of horses and [[silphium]], a plant used for rich seasoning and medicine.<ref name=\"roller\"/> Cyrene became a place of cultivation, where knowledge blossomed. Like any young Greek at the time, Eratosthenes would have studied in the local [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], where he would have learned physical skills and social discourse as well as reading, writing, arithmetic, poetry, and music.<ref name=\"bailey\" />\n[[File:Eratosthenes Teaching in Alexandria (Bernardo Strozzi, Montreal).jpg|thumb|''Eratosthenes teaching in Alexandria'' by [[Bernardo Strozzi]] (1635)]]\n\nEratosthenes went to Athens to further his studies. There he was taught [[Stoicism]] by its founder, [[Zeno of Citium]], in philosophical lectures on living a virtuous life.<ref name=\"rist\" /> He then studied under [[Aristo of Chios]], who led a more [[Cynicism (philosophy)|cynical]] school of philosophy. He also studied under the head of the [[Platonic Academy]], who was [[Arcesilaus of Pitane]]. His interest in Plato led him to write his very first work at a scholarly level, ''Platonikos'', inquiring into the mathematical foundation of Plato's philosophies.<ref name=\"chambers\" /> Eratosthenes was a man of many perspectives and investigated the art of poetry under [[Callimachus]].<ref name=\"bailey\" /> He wrote poems: one in [[hexameter]]s called ''Hermes'', illustrating the god's life history; and another in [[elegiac | elegiacs]], called ''Erigone'', describing the suicide of the Athenian maiden [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)]].<ref name=\"chambers\" /> He wrote ''Chronographies'', a text that scientifically depicted dates of importance, beginning with the [[Trojan War]]. This work was highly esteemed for its accuracy. [[George Syncellus]] was later able to preserve from ''Chronographies'' a list of 38 kings of the [[Egyptian Thebes]]. Eratosthenes also wrote ''Olympic Victors'', a chronology of the winners of the Olympic Games. It is not known when he wrote his works, but they highlighted his abilities.\n\nThese works and his great poetic abilities led the pharaoh [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] to seek to place him as a librarian at the [[Library of Alexandria]] in the year 245 BC. Eratosthenes, then thirty years old, accepted Ptolemy's invitation and traveled to Alexandria, where he lived for the rest of his life. Within about five years he became Chief Librarian, a position that the poet [[Apollonius Rhodius]] had previously held. As head of the library Eratosthenes tutored the children of Ptolemy, including [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] who became the fourth Ptolemaic pharaoh. He expanded the library's holdings: in Alexandria all books had to be surrendered for duplication. It was said that these were copied so accurately that it was impossible to tell if the library had returned the original or the copy.\nHe sought to maintain the reputation of the Library of Alexandria against competition from the [[Library of Pergamum]]. Eratosthenes created a whole section devoted to the examination of Homer, and acquired original works of great tragic dramas of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]].<ref name=\"chambers\" />\n\nEratosthenes made several important contributions to [[mathematics]] and [[science]], and was a friend of [[Archimedes]]. Around 255&nbsp;BC, he invented the [[armillary sphere]]. In ''On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies'', [[Cleomedes]] credited him with having calculated the [[Earth's circumference]] around 240 BC, with a high precision.<ref name=\"russo273277\" />\n\nEratosthenes believed there was both good and bad in every nation and criticized [[Aristotle]] for arguing that humanity was divided into Greeks and [[barbarian]]s, as well as for arguing that the Greeks should keep themselves racially pure.<ref name=\"alexander\" /> As he aged he contracted [[ophthalmia]], becoming blind around 195 BC. Losing the ability to read and to observe nature plagued and depressed him, leading him to voluntarily starve himself to death. He died in 194&nbsp;BC at 82 in Alexandria.<ref name=\"bailey\" />\n\n== Scholarly career ==\n=== Measurement of the Earth's circumference ===\n<!--[[History of physics]] links here -->\n\nThe measure of [[Earth's circumference]] is the most famous among the results obtained by Eratosthenes,<ref>{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Lucio |author-link=Lucio Russo |date=2004 |title=The Forgotten Revolution |url= |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |page=68}}.</ref>  who estimated that the meridian has a length of 252,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]], with an error on the real value between -2.4% and +0.8% (assuming a value for the stadion between 155 and 160 metres).<ref name=\"russo273277\" /> Eratosthenes described his technique in a book entitled ''On the measure of the Earth'', which has not been preserved.\n\n==== Cleomedes' simplified version ====\n[[File:Eratostene--Calcolo Raggio Terrestre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Measure of Earth's circumference according to Cleomedes' simplified version, based on the wrong assumption that [[Syene]] is on the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and on the same meridian as [[Alexandria]]]]\n\nEratosthenes' method to calculate the [[Earth's circumference]] has been lost; what has been preserved is the simplified version described by [[Cleomedes]] to popularise the discovery.<ref>Cleomedes, ''Caelestia'', i.7.49-52.</ref> Cleomedes invites his reader to consider two Egyptian cities, [[Alexandria]] and [[Syene]], modern [[Assuan]]:\n# Cleomedes assumes that the distance between Syene and Alexandria was 5,000 [[Stadion (unit)|stadia]] (a figure that was checked yearly by professional [[bematist]]s, ''mensores regii'');<ref>Martianus Capella, ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'', VI.598.</ref> \n# he assumes the simplified (but false) hypothesis that Syene was precisely on the [[Tropic of Cancer]], saying that at [[Solar noon|local noon]] on the summer [[solstice]] the Sun was directly overhead;<ref name=\"pillar\" />\n# he assumes the simplified (but false) hypothesis that Syene and Alexandria are on the same meridian.\n\nUnder the previous assumptions, says Cleomedes, you can measure the Sun's angle of elevation at noon of the summer solstice in Alexandria, by using a vertical rod (a [[gnomon]]) of known length and measuring the length of its shadow on the ground;<ref name=\"bucknell\" /> it is then possible to calculated the angle of the Sun's rays,<ref name=\"anthony\" /> which he claims to be about 7\u00b0, or 1/50th the circumference of a circle. Taking the Earth as spherical, the Earth's circumference would be fifty times the distance between Alexandria and Syene, that is 250,000 stadia. Since 1 Egyptian stadium is equal to 157.5 metres, the result is 39,375&nbsp;km, which is 1.4% less than the real number, 39,941&nbsp;km.\n\n==== Eratosthenes' method ====\n\nEratosthenes' method was actually more complicated, as stated by the same Cleomedes, whose purpose was to present a simplified version of the one described in Eratosthenes' book. The method was based on several [[surveying]] trips conducted by professional [[bematist]]s, whose job was to precisely measure the extent of the territory of Egypt for agricultural and taxation-related purposes.<ref name=\"russo273277\">{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Lucio |author-link=Lucio Russo |date=2004 |title=The Forgotten Revolution |url= |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer|page=273-277}}</ref> Furthermore, the fact that Eratosthenes' measure corresponds precisely to 252,000 stadia might be intentional, since it is a number that can be divided by all natural numbers from 1 to 10: some historians believe that Eratosthenes changed from the 250,000 value written by Cleomedes to this new value to simply calculations;<ref>{{cite journal |first=Dennis |last=Rawlins |title=The Erathostenes-Strabo Nile Map.

Using his discoveries and knowledge of its size and shape, he began to sketch it. In the Library of Alexandria he had access to various travel books, which contained various items of information and representations of the world that needed to be pieced together in some organized format.<ref name=\"Smith2005\" /> In his three-volume work ''Geography'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Geographika|script=Latn}}), he described and mapped his entire known world, even dividing the Earth into five climate zones:<ref name=\"Morris\" /> two freezing zones around the poles, two temperate zones, and a zone encompassing the equator and the tropics.<ref name=\"Hutchinson\" /> He had invented geography. He created terminology that is still used today. He placed grids of overlapping lines over the surface of the Earth. He used parallels and meridians to link together every place in the world. It was now possible to estimate one's distance from remote locations with this network over the surface of the Earth. In the ''Geography'' the names of over 400 cities and their locations were shown: this had never been achieved before.<ref name=\"roller\"/>  Unfortunately, his ''Geography'' has been lost to history, but fragments of the work can be pieced together from other great historians like [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Polybius]], [[Strabo]], and [[Marcianus]].\n* The first book was something of an introduction and gave a review of his predecessors, recognizing their contributions that he compiled in the library. In this book Eratosthenes denounced [[Homer]] as not providing any insight into what he now described as geography. His disapproval of Homer's topography angered many who believed the world depicted in the ''Odyssey'' to be legitimate.<ref name=\"chambers\"/><ref name=\"Eckerman\" /> He also commented on the ideas of the nature and origin of the Earth: he had thought of Earth as an immovable globe; while on its surface was a place that was changing. He had hypothesized that at one time the [[Mediterranean]] was a vast lake that covered the countries that surrounded it; and had only become connected to the ocean to the west when a passage had opened up sometime in its history.\n* In the second book is his discovery about the circumference of the Earth. This is where, according to Pliny, \"The world was grasped.\" Here Eratosthenes described his famous story of the well in Syene, wherein at noon each summer solstice, the Sun's rays shone straight down into the city-center well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/big-history-project/solar-system-and-earth/knowing-solar-system-earth/a/eratosthenes-of-cyrene|title=Eratosthenes of Cyrene|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> This book would now be considered a text on [[mathematical geography]].\n* His third book of the ''Geography'' contained [[political geography]]. He cited countries and used parallel lines to divide the map into sections, to give accurate descriptions of the realms. This was a breakthrough, and can be considered the beginning of geography. For this, Eratosthenes was named the \"Father of Modern Geography.\"<ref name=\"Smith2005\" />\n\n===  Achievements ===\nEratosthenes was described by the [[Suda Lexicon]] as a \u03a0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (Pentathlos) which can be translated as \"All-Rounder\", for he was skilled in a variety of things: He was a true polymath. He was nicknamed Beta because he was great at many things and tried to get his hands on every bit of information but never achieved the highest rank in anything; [[Strabo]] accounts Eratosthenes as a mathematician among geographers and a geographer among mathematicians.<ref name=\"Dicks1971\" />\n* [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his ''[[Preparation for the Gospel|Preparatio Evangelica]]'' includes a brief chapter of three sentences on celestial distances ([http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_15_book15.htm Book XV], Chapter 53). He states simply that Eratosthenes found the distance to the Sun to be \"{{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b4\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f40\u03ba\u03c4\u03c9\u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}\" (literally \"of [[Stadia (length)|stadia]] [[myriad]]s 400 and 80,000\") and the distance to the Moon to be 780,000 stadia. The expression for the distance to the Sun has been translated either as 4,080,000 stadia (1903 translation by E. H. Gifford), or as 804,000,000 stadia (edition of Edouard des Places, dated 1974\u20131991). The meaning depends on whether Eusebius meant 400 myriad plus 80,000 or \"400 and 80,000\" myriad. With a stade of {{cvt|185|m|||}}, 804,000,000 stadia is {{cvt|149000000|km|||}}, approximately the distance from the Earth to the Sun.\n* Eratosthenes also calculated the Sun's diameter. According to Macrobious, Eratosthenes made the diameter of the Sun to be about 27 times that of the Earth.<ref name=\"Smith2005\" /> The actual figure is approximately 109 times.<ref name=\"caltech\" />\n* During his time at the Library of Alexandria, Eratosthenes devised a calendar using his predictions about the [[ecliptic]] of the Earth. He calculated that there are 365 days in a year and that every fourth year there would be 366 days.<ref name=\"manawatu\" />\n* He was also very proud of his solution for [[Doubling the Cube]]. His motivation was that he wanted to produce catapults. Eratosthenes constructed a mechanical line drawing device to calculate the cube, called the mesolabio. He dedicated his solution to King Ptolemy, presenting a model in bronze with it a letter and an epigram.<ref name=\"zhumud\" /> Archimedes was Eratosthenes' friend and he, too, worked on the war instrument with mathematics. Archimedes dedicated his book ''The Method'' to Eratosthenes, knowing his love for learning and mathematics.<ref name=\"chondros\" />\n\n===Number theory===\n[[File:Sieve of Eratosthenes animation.gif|right|frame|Sieve of Eratosthenes: algorithm steps for primes below 121 (including optimization of starting from the prime's square).]]\n{{Main|Sieve of Eratosthenes|primality test}}\n\nEratosthenes proposed a simple [[algorithm]] for finding [[prime numbers]]. This algorithm is known in mathematics as the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]].\n\nIn mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes (Greek: \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u1f18\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2), one of a number of [[Generating primes#Prime sieves|prime number sieves]], is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It does so by iteratively marking as composite, ''i.e.'', not prime, the multiples of each prime, starting with the multiples of 2. The multiples of a given prime are generated starting from that prime, as a sequence of numbers with the same difference, equal to that prime, between consecutive numbers. This is the sieve's key distinction from using trial division to sequentially test each candidate number for divisibility by each prime.\n\n== Works ==\nEratosthenes was one of the most pre-eminent scholarly figures of his time, and produced works covering a vast area of knowledge before and during his time at the Library. He wrote on many topics&nbsp;\u2014 geography, mathematics, philosophy, chronology, literary criticism, grammar, poetry, and even old comedies. Unfortunately, there are only fragments left of his works after the [[destruction of the Library of Alexandria]].<ref name=\"Dicks1971\" />\n\n===Titles===\n* ''Platonikos''\n* ''Hermes''\n* ''Erigone''\n* ''Chronographies''\n* ''Olympic Victors''\n* ''\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b3\u1fc6\u03c2'' (''On the Measurement of the Earth'')<ref name=\"hero\" /> (lost, summarized by [[Cleomedes]])\n* ''\u0413\u03b5\u03c9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03d5\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac'' (''Geographika'')<ref name=\"Dicks1971\"/> (lost, criticized by [[Strabo]])\n* ''Arsinoe'' (a memoir of queen [[Arsinoe III of Egypt|Arsinoe]]; lost; quoted by [[Athenaeus]] in the ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'')\n* ''Ariston'' (concerning [[Aristo of Chios]]' addiction to luxury); lost; quoted by [[Athenaeus]] in the ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'')<ref name=\"ASmith\" />\n* A fragmentary collection of [[Hellenistic]] myths about the [[constellation]]s, called ''[[Catasterismi]]'' (''Katasterismoi''), was attributed to Eratosthenes, perhaps to add to its credibility.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eratosthenes (crater)]] on the [[Moon]]\n* [[Eratosthenian]] period in the [[lunar geologic timescale]]\n* [[Eratosthenes Seamount]] in the eastern Mediterranean Sea\n* [[Posidonius]], another Greek philosopher who calculated the circumference of the Earth\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot\n|notes =\n{{NoteTag|name=birth|The [[Suda]] states that he was born in the 126th [[Olympiad]], (276\u2013272&nbsp;BC).
