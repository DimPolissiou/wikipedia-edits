Initially debuting on February 26, 1995, as a seven-minute ''[[What a Cartoon!|World Premiere Toons]]'' pilot, it was expanded into a full series after gaining network approval. The first season, which consists of 13 episodes divided into three segments each, premiered on [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] on April 27, 1996,<ref name=\"TNTcommercials\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZot5PlRZQ|title=TNT commercials ca.

In this season, Allison Moore, the voice actor for Dee Dee, was replaced by [[Kat Cressida]], save for a few episodes. \"Last But Not Beast\", the second-season finale, was originally supposed to conclude the series in 1998. However, Tartakovsky directed a television movie titled ''[[Dexter's Laboratory: Ego Trip]]'' which aired on Cartoon Network on December 10, 1999. He left the series after the movie, focusing on his other projects, ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]''.\n\nProduction on a third season began in 2001 with [[Chris Savino]] taking over as creative director and later producer. It premiered worldwide on November 16, 2001, during Cartoon Network's \"Dexter Goes Global\" marathon.<ref name=\"global\">{{cite news|title=Dexter Goes Global in Worldwide Marathon|first=Leigh|last=Godfrey|url=http://www.awn.com/news/television/dexter-goes-global-worldwide-marathon|date=November 16, 2001|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=2013-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021213630/http://www.awn.com/news/television/dexter-goes-global-worldwide-marathon|archive-date=October 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The third-season episode \"Poppa Wheely/A Mom Cartoon/The Mock Side of the Moon\" is the first to feature [[Christine Cavanaugh]]'s replacement [[Candi Milo]] as the voice of Dexter. Milo would voice the character from the next episode onward, with the exception of \"Tele Trauma\". A fourth and final season consisting of 13 episodes aired from November 22, 2002, to November 20, 2003. In total there have been 78 episodes and a television movie across 4 seasons.\n\nA previously unaired episode called \"[[Rude Removal]]\" was originally shown only at certain comic conventions that Tartakovsky attended beginning in 1998.

In this season, Allison Moore, the voice actor for Dee Dee, was replaced by [[Kat Cressida]], save for a few episodes. \"Last But Not Beast\", the second-season finale, was originally supposed to conclude the series in 1998. However, Tartakovsky directed a television movie titled ''[[Dexter's Laboratory: Ego Trip]]'' which aired on Cartoon Network on December 10, 1999. He left the series after the movie, focusing on his other projects, ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003 TV series)|Star Wars: Clone Wars]]''.\n\nProduction on a third season began in 2001 with [[Chris Savino]] taking over as creative director and later producer. It premiered worldwide on November 16, 2001, during Cartoon Network's \"Dexter Goes Global\" marathon.<ref name=\"global\">{{cite news|title=Dexter Goes Global in Worldwide Marathon|first=Leigh|last=Godfrey|url=http://www.awn.com/news/television/dexter-goes-global-worldwide-marathon|date=November 16, 2001|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=2013-06-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021213630/http://www.awn.com/news/television/dexter-goes-global-worldwide-marathon|archive-date=October 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The third-season episode \"Poppa Wheely/A Mom Cartoon/The Mock Side of the Moon\" is the first to feature [[Christine Cavanaugh]]'s replacement [[Candi Milo]] as the voice of Dexter.

In order to obtain the WMA job, he had to prove he was a college graduate. As he later reported in an interview, he claimed in his job application at WMA that he had graduated from the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA). Because he worked in the mailroom, Geffen was able to intercept a letter from UCLA to WMA which stated that he had not graduated from UCLA. He modified the letter to show that he had attended and graduated, then submitted it to WMA.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trott|first1=Dave|title=One + One = Three|date=2015|publisher=Macmillan|location=London, England|isbn=978-1-4472-8703-2|page=10 |edition=First|url=https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/dave-trott/one-plus-one-equals-three|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nHis colleagues in the mailroom included [[Elliot Roberts]], who later became Geffen's partner in a management company.

The name Asylum was chosen because of the owners' reputations for signing artists who would struggle to find a record company that would contract with them. The label was distributed by Atlantic Records at this time. Asylum became a generator of the Southern California folk-rock sound and signed artists such as [[Eagles (band)|the Eagles]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Judee Sill]], and [[J.D. Souther]]. Later in the 1970s Geffen left Asylum which was later acquired by Atlantic's parent company, [[Warner Communications]], and merged with [[Elektra Records]] in 1972 to become Elektra/Asylum Records. The label was revived in 2004 as an urban music operation, signing hip-hop artists such as Waka Flocka Flame, Cam\u2019ron, Gucci Mane, Paul Wall, Mike Jones and Bun B.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGeffen remained in charge until December 1975, when he went to work as vice chairman of [[Warner Bros.]] film studios.<ref>Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', pp. 261-262, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref> He then retired and in 1977 was informed (erroneously) that he had cancer.<ref>Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', p. 282, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref> During his retirement period he spent a short time (the fall of 1978 and spring of 1979) teaching a noncredit seminar on the music industry and arts management at [[Yale University]], where he featured classroom guests Jackson Browne and [[Paul Simon]].<ref>Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', p. 294, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref> In 1980 a new medical diagnosis revealed the error in the original diagnosis<ref>Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', pp. 296-297, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref> and Geffen was given a clean bill of health, whereupon he decided to return to working in the entertainment industry.\n\n===Geffen Records===\nIn 1980, he founded [[Geffen Records]] and recruited [[Warner Bros. Records]] exec Ed Rosenblatt as president. The Geffen label's meteoric rise to prominence within the year proved a bittersweet success. Geffen's first artist to sign on was [[Donna Summer]], who was anxious to leave [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]]/[[PolyGram Records]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/donna-summer-death-barbra-streisand-duet-enough-is-enough-326744|title=How Donna Summer and Barbra Streisand's Famous Duet 'Enough Is Enough' Came Together|author= Degen Pener|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 18, 2012}}</ref> Geffen shortly after released her ''[[The Wanderer (Donna Summer album)|The Wanderer]]'' album, the lead single of which reached #3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and the album certified gold.

[[Yoko Ono]], Lennon's wife and partner, stated that Geffen was the only label head to pay attention to her. In December 1980, Lennon was [[Death of John Lennon|murdered]] and ''Double Fantasy'' became a massive seller.

In order to obtain the WMA job, he had to prove he was a college graduate. As he later reported in an interview, he claimed in his job application at WMA that he had graduated from the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA).

The name Asylum was chosen because of the owners' reputations for signing artists who would struggle to find a record company that would contract with them. The label was distributed by Atlantic Records at this time. Asylum became a generator of the Southern California folk-rock sound and signed artists such as [[Eagles (band)|the Eagles]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Judee Sill]], and [[J.D. Souther]]. Later in the 1970s Geffen left Asylum which was later acquired by Atlantic's parent company, [[Warner Communications]], and merged with [[Elektra Records]] in 1972 to become Elektra/Asylum Records. The label was revived in 2004 as an urban music operation, signing hip-hop artists such as Waka Flocka Flame, Cam\u2019ron, Gucci Mane, Paul Wall, Mike Jones and Bun B.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGeffen remained in charge until December 1975, when he went to work as vice chairman of [[Warner Bros.]] film studios.<ref>Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', pp. 261-262, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref> He then retired and in 1977 was informed (erroneously) that he had cancer.<ref>Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', p. 282, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref> During his retirement period he spent a short time (the fall of 1978 and spring of 1979) teaching a noncredit seminar on the music industry and arts management at [[Yale University]], where he featured classroom guests Jackson Browne and [[Paul Simon]].<ref>Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', p. 294, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref> In 1980 a new medical diagnosis revealed the error in the original diagnosis<ref>Tom King, ''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood'', pp. 296-297, Broadway Books (New York 2001).</ref> and Geffen was given a clean bill of health, whereupon he decided to return to working in the entertainment industry.\n\n===Geffen Records===\nIn 1980, he founded [[Geffen Records]] and recruited [[Warner Bros. Records]] exec Ed Rosenblatt as president. The Geffen label's meteoric rise to prominence within the year proved a bittersweet success. Geffen's first artist to sign on was [[Donna Summer]], who was anxious to leave [[Casablanca Records|Casablanca]]/[[PolyGram Records]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/donna-summer-death-barbra-streisand-duet-enough-is-enough-326744|title=How Donna Summer and Barbra Streisand's Famous Duet 'Enough Is Enough' Came Together|author= Degen Pener|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 18, 2012}}</ref> Geffen shortly after released her ''[[The Wanderer (Donna Summer album)|The Wanderer]]'' album, the lead single of which reached #3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and the album certified gold.

[[Yoko Ono]], Lennon's wife and partner, stated that Geffen was the only label head to pay attention to her. In December 1980, Lennon was [[Death of John Lennon|murdered]] and ''Double Fantasy'' became a massive seller.

The game is chronologically the sixth installment in the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, which is part of the larger ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in Japan in September 2016 and worldwide in April 2017, where it was published by Atlus in Japan and North America and by [[Deep Silver]] in Europe and Australia. An expanded version featuring new content, '''''Persona 5 Royal''''',{{efn|Known as ''Persona 5: The Royal'' {{nihongo||\u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca5 \u30b6\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Perusona Faibu Za Roiyaru}} in Japanese}} was released in Japan in October 2019 and worldwide in March 2020.\n\n''Persona 5'' takes place in modern-day [[Tokyo]] and follows [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] after his transfer to Shujin Academy due to being put on probation for an assault of which he was falsely accused. During a school year, he and other students awaken to special powers, becoming a group of secret [[vigilante]]s known as the [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]]. They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous games in the series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as the [[Persona (series)#Personas|Persona]]. The game incorporates role-playing and [[dungeon crawl]]ing elements alongside [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] scenarios.\n\n''Persona 5'' was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus led by game director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]]. Along with Hashino, returning staff from earlier ''Persona'' games included character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. Preparatory work began during the development of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning after the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011. First announced in 2013, ''Persona 5'' was delayed from its original late 2014 release date due to the game not being fully finished. The game's themes revolved around attaining freedom from the limitations of modern society, while its story was strongly inspired by [[picaresque fiction]] and the party's Personas being based on well-known literary outlaws and rebels.\n\n''Persona 5'' was met with critical acclaim, with praise given to its visual presentation and art direction, cast, gameplay, and music. The game is considered to be one of the greatest role-playing games of all time and was nominated for and won multiple awards. The game shipped over three million copies worldwide by the end of 2019, making it the best-selling entry in the overall ''Megami Tensei'' franchise. Several other media, including two spin-off games, ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]]'' and ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]'', as well as manga and [[Persona 5: The Animation|anime adaptations]], have also been released. The game's cast has also made appearances in other games, such as Joker appearing as a playable character in the 2018 crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{See also|Persona (series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Persona series}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer = [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], the game's protagonist, has two alternating lifestyles: a normal student life ''(top)'', and adventures into otherworldly locations ''(bottom)''.\n| image1 = Persona 5 Classroom.jpg\n| width1 = 250\n| image2 = Persona 5 Palace Combat.jpg\n| width2 = 250\n}}\n''Persona 5'' is a [[role-playing video game]] where the player takes on the role of a high school student, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], who lives out a single year while attending school in modern-day [[Tokyo]]. The game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a [[social simulation game]]. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events as Joker attends school. He can perform part-time jobs and pursue leisure activities or create battle items. These various activities raise character attributes, which grant passive [[Status effect#Buffs|buffing]] effects during battle.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/> When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships known as ''Confidants''; an evolution of the ''Social Link'' system from ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]''. With this system, the main protagonist can converse with and improve his relationship with other characters he meets, with some leading to possible romances. Improving Confidant ranks with [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] members unlocks various abilities for use in combat, such as the \"Baton Pass\" ability, which allows the player to directly select another character after a critical hit while granting a temporary attack boost.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/> Improving ranks with non-party Confidants grant other bonuses, such as giving access to new [[Item (gaming)|items]] and equipment and boosting [[experience point]] and yen gain.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nAlongside the normal school life is [[dungeon crawl]]ing gameplay of two different types within a realm called the Metaverse: story-specific dungeons called Palaces and randomly-generated Mementos dungeons. Both are populated by Shadows, physical manifestations of suppressed psyches that are modeled after mythological and religious figures. Within Mementos dungeons, the party can fulfill requests from [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) received from a \"Confidant\" links.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> While navigating, the party uses stealth to avoid the sight of enemy Shadows, and some areas hold puzzles that can be solved using an insight ability known as \"Third Eye\",<ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/> which highlights interactable objects and enemy strength compared to the party. When exploring story-centered Palaces, an \"Alertness Meter\" is present, where the party being spotted or fleeing combat results in security being raised. If security reaches 100%, the party is forced to leave the Palace. The Alertness level can be lowered by launching surprise attacks on and eliminating enemies, and also lowers automatically overnight.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/> Throughout Palaces are locations known as \"safe rooms\". In them, the player can [[Saved game|save their game]], heal their party, and [[fast travel]] to other safe rooms within the Palace.\n\nAs with previous entries in the series, the game uses a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] combat system: battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to both melee and gun weapons, in addition to being able to summon Personas, manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche used mainly for special attacks.<ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"ShackMasks\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |title=Persona 5 Royal New PS4 Game 2020?? |last=Teja|first=Ravi |publisher=Raviteja|date=March 4, 2020 |accessdate=March 4, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830213249/https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |archivedate=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ShackMasks\"/> If a character strikes an enemy's weakness, they knock the enemy down and are awarded an additional turn. If all enemies are knocked down, a \"Hold Up\" is triggered. During one, the party can launch a devastating \"All-Out Attack\", demand money or items, or enter a negotiation. Negotiation allows Joker to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona: they can only be persuaded to join if Joker is their level or higher.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/> Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the game ends. At times, if a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by enemy Shadows, and is unable to return to the party if the resultant negotiation fails.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\nNew Personas are gained from battle through successful negotiation, and different Persona types are represented through different arcana linked to Confidant links. Personas can be combined, or \"fused\", or otherwise further manipulated within the Velvet Room, a realm Joker visits as part of his journey through the story.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> In the Velvet Room, Personas can be fused with \"Guillotine\" fusion processes, with the resultant Persona inheriting skills and stats from its parents. The more skills a Persona has, the more are passed on to the fused Persona. How powerful Personas are through fusion depends on how advanced its associated Confidant link is. Also, Personas can be sacrificed in various ways, also styled after styles of capital punishment: \"Hanging\" grants a sacrificed Persona's experience points to another chosen Persona, and \"Electric Chair\" sacrifice one to create a high-end item. A Persona can also be sent into \"Solitary Confinement\", where they undergo intensive training and gain additional skills quicker than normal. The number of days a Persona must remain to gain strength lessens based on its arcana strength.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/>\n\nMinor multiplayer elements are incorporated into the game through the \"Thieves Guild\" feature. Similar to the \"Vox Populi\" system from ''Persona 4 Golden'', players have the option of seeing what activities other players did during any given day. Players can send messages to each other, in addition to affecting the Alertness meter in the player's favor, and aiding in battle when a party member is taken hostage by an enemy.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting and characters===\n{{Main Article|List of Persona 5 characters}}\n''Persona 5'' takes place within the ''Persona'' universe, revolving around a group of high school students who harness Personas, physical manifestations of their inner psyche.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/> ''Persona 5'' is set in modern-day Tokyo, in April of the year \"20XX\", with navigable real-world locations within the city including [[Akihabara]], [[Shinjuku]] and [[Shibuya]].<ref name=\"P5year\"/> Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered, such as shops, restaurants and movie theaters. A major setting throughout the game is Shujin Academy, a high school that the protagonist attends.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/> The second major location is the \"Metaverse\", a supernatural realm consisting of the physical manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires. In the Metaverse, people with corrupted enough desires form their own unique \"Palace\", which is modeled after their distorted perception of the world, along with a Shadow version of themselves possessing a \"Treasure\" symbolic of their desires.<ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> Returning from earlier entries is the Velvet Room, a place that exists for the growth of Persona users that shifts appearance depending on the current guest: in ''Persona 5'', it takes the form of a prison.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe [[player character]] is a [[silent protagonist]], a commonplace feature in other ''Persona'' games, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]]. He becomes the leader of a [[vigilante]] group known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, who change the hearts of criminals and other malevolent people through the Metaverse.<ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> He forms it with Morgana, a mysterious cat-like creature who serves as the Thieves' second-in-command, who wants to discover his origins and restore his true form. Other founding members include school delinquent Ryuji Sakamoto and fashion model Ann Takamaki. More people join the group throughout the game, including art prodigy Yusuke Kitagawa, student council president [[Makoto Niijima]], [[hikikomori]] computer hacker Futaba Sakura, and cultured corporate heiress Haru Okumura.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Also interacting with Joker are Goro Akechi, a high school detective; Sae Niijima, public prosecutor and Makoto's older sister; and the residents of the Velvet Room, Igor and his two assistants Caroline and Justine.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"KotakuLysis\"/> Joker also has interactions with other confidants, including his caretaker and Futaba's adoptive father Sojiro Sakura, classmate Yuuki Mishima, his teacher and part-time maid Sadayo Kawakami, arcade gamer Shinya Oda, journalist Ichiko Ohya, [[fortune teller]] Chihaya Mifune, [[shogi]] master Hifumi Togo, doctor Tae Takemi, politician Toranosuke Yoshida, and [[model gun]] store owner Munehisa Iwai.\n\n===Plot===\nAfter Joker defends a woman from being abused by a drunken man on the street, he is falsely charged with assault and put on [[probation]], resulting in expulsion from his school. Joker is sent to Tokyo to stay with his family associate Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must \"rehabilitate\" to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads Joker into the Metaverse and the Palace of the school's abusive volleyball coach Suguru Kamoshida. Joker meets Morgana, who informs him of the ability to change wicked people's hearts by stealing their \"Treasure\", the emotional root of their behavior, from the Palaces ruled by their Shadow selves. After successfully reforming Kamoshida, Ryuji, Joker, Ann, and Morgana form the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, stealing corruption from the hearts of adults to reform the city.\n\nAs the number of the Phantom Thieves' members and successes grows, they attract the attention of the public and police, including public prosecutor Sae Niijima and detective prodigy Goro Akechi. The Phantom Thieves learn that another secret group, including a black-masked assassin, is using the Metaverse to murder their targets and then framing the Phantom Thieves of Hearts for the killings. In pursuit of the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, who is subsequently revealed to be the black-masked assassin. Escaping into hiding with Sae's help, the Phantom Thieves deduce that the conspiracy's leader is politician Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to his becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, as well as the one who pressed assault charges against Joker. When the Phantom Thieves infiltrate Shido's Palace, they face Akechi, who reveals himself to be Shido's illegitimate son. He also reveals that he has been secretly plotting to exact his revenge on Shido for years of neglect and summons his true Persona: Loki. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to protect the Phantom Thieves from a group of enemies, allowing them to escape and reach Shido.\n\nDespite Shido's arrest and confession after his change of heart, the public remains uninterested and has lost trust in both authority and the Phantom Thieves. In response, the Phantom Thieves make a final heist to infiltrate the depths of Mementos and steal the treasure at its core. Inside, they discover that the public is in chaos and has chosen to give up their autonomy. The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure, taking form as the Holy Grail, and vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merge with reality. Waking in the Velvet Room, Joker confronts Igor, Caroline, and Justine. Caroline and Justine regain their memories and merge into Lavenza, their true form. Lavenza reveals the Igor Joker has been seeing in the Velvet room up until this point to be an imposter who imprisoned the real Igor. The imposter is then revealed to be [[Yaldabaoth]], the Holy Grail, who was created from humanity's wish to give up control. Through a bet made with Igor over humanity's goals, Yaldabaoth had given Joker and Akechi their abilities to see whether the world would be preserved or be destroyed through their actions, all while steering the game in his favor.\n\nJoker rejects Yaldabaoth's offer to return to his world at the cost of his freedom, and he, along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves, fight him. Joker's confidants rally the popular support of the people, rebelling against Yaldabaoth's control of humanity and allowing Joker to awaken his ultimate persona to destroy Yaldabaoth and the Metaverse. After Yaldabaoth's defeat, in order for Shido to be prosecuted, Joker must turn himself into the police. While Joker is incarcerated, the rest of the Phantom Thieves and his confidants successfully help secure evidence of Joker's innocence in the assault charge, leading to his conviction being overturned. By spring, Joker's friends drive him back to his hometown.\n\n===''Royal''===\nIn ''Persona 5 Royal'', two new characters interact with the Phantom Thieves: Kasumi Yoshizawa, an accomplished rhythmic gymnast who transferred to Shujin at the same time as the protagonist, and Takuto Maruki, a school counselor hired after Kamoshida is exposed. Kasumi awakens to her Persona after calling the protagonist to a new Palace in Odaiba that quickly vanishes. Maruki, in turn, talks to each of the Phantom Thieves, learning their deepest wishes. After defeating Yaldabaoth, the still-living Akechi turns himself over to Sae in the protagonist's place. At the beginning of the following year, the protagonist finds reality distorted; Akechi was released without reason, and each Phantom Thief member has had their deepest wish granted. The protagonist and Akechi, together with the also-aware Kasumi, return to the Odaiba Palace and investigate. The Palace's master is Maruki, who reveals that \"Kasumi\" is Sumire, sister to the original Kasumi, who died in a car accident saving Sumire.\n\nMaruki can use his Persona to alter a person's reality, with his first use of it being to make his then-girlfriend forget her parents' murder. Yaldabaoth's manipulation of the world drove Maruki and his Persona over the edge, and they became the new controllers of Mementos and warped all reality into a dream-like ideal. Sumire turns against the protagonist to protect her identity as \"Kasumi.\" The protagonist snaps his friends out of Maruki's reality, then frees Sumire from his influence. Depending on player choices, it is revealed that Akechi's survival is dependant on the new reality, and Maruki offers the protagonist the option of accepting it to save Akechi. Refusing the offer, the reformed Phantom Thieves, including Akechi and Sumire, defeat Maruki. Reality returns to normal, and with Akechi missing and the protagonist in prison.\n\nOn their final meeting after the protagonist's release, each member of the Phantom Thieves chooses to pursue their dreams within the current reality. On the day he is due to return home, the protagonist escapes tailing government agents with help from both the Phantom Thieves and a reformed Maruki. At the station, Sumire bids him farewell. If Akechi's confidant level is at its highest, and with the right dialogue choices, a man wearing Akechi's clothes is briefly seen passing through the train window that the protagonist is riding.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the ''Persona'' series. Preparatory development of the game began in 2008, following the release of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning following the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011.<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/><ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Hashino was only fully involved in development after ''Catherine'' was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next ''Persona'' game's development. Development lasted five years.<ref name=\"PersonaBlog\"/><ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> ''Persona 5'' would be Hashino's last game in the series as the leader of P-Studio, as he would afterwards form a separate internal team called Studio Zero.<ref name=\"P5studioA\"/><ref name=\"P5studioB\"/> When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modeling work for the ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/>\n\nWhile the final game retained the turn-based system from earlier entries, one of the early design drafts was for an action-based system incorporating real-time elements foreign to the series. This idea was ultimately scrapped, but real-time command elements were introduced into the battle system, allowing the gameplay to evolve without extensive changes to the core system.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> A major new addition was the inclusions of unique dungeons with locked layouts as opposed to the dominant randomly generated dungeons of previous ''Persona'' games. This was done to both emulate the game's themes and provide veteran players with something different.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\"/> A returning feature from both earlier ''Persona'' games and the mainline ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series was Negotiation: as it was considered a key part of the overall franchise by fans, Hashino decided to reintroduce it after being absent from the previous two mainline entries. The Negotiation system for ''Persona 5'' was tied into the origins of Shadows as suppressed psyches within the Collective Unconscious. The \"Hold Up\" function was inspired by scenes in films where the antagonist would hold people at gunpoint and make demands. These functions were incorporated due to the game being in part a celebration of the series' history.<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> While designing the gameplay elements, the weather, and environmental elements were all designed to reflect the real world. Dungeon layout was split into three distinct types: the Tokyo overworld environments, \"institutions\" such as Joker's high school, and dungeon environments.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Some segments took control away from the player aside from limited dialogue choices; this was chosen as it reflected the controlled environment of Japanese high schoolers.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/>\n\nWhile ''Catherine'' used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]], ''Persona 5'' used a specially-created engine. Hashino believed that the new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it would result in a long wait by fans for the game.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Character modeling, in general, was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine-tuning.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> The characters were originally rendered realistically like in ''Catherine'', but the team felt that it was \"wrong\" for the ''Persona'' series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them, doing something similar for the interface and menu design.<ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> In contrast to ''Persona 4'', which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for ''Persona 5'' enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used for members of the main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for general event scenes and gameplay.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> ''Persona 5'' was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/>\n\n===Story and themes===\nThe original story concept was written by Hashino, while the scenario was co-written by Shinji Yamamoto and Yuichiro Tanaka.<ref name=\"P5credits\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/> The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', with \"self-discovery\" and \"journey\" being its keywords.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Originally using the concept of a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking trip]] around the world as a framing device for the story, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in the wake of the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> More specifically, it has been noted that the Japanese government's actions in response to the earthquake and tsunami's fallout, along with Japanese citizens' reactions to how the government acted during that time, may have served as partial influences on the game's themes.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|title=The Real-World Problems Behind Persona 5|last=McCarthy|first=Caty|date=May 5, 2017|website=USgamer|language=en|access-date=June 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603100720/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|archive-date=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following that crisis and seeing how people were bonding in the face of it, Hashino decided to have the story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being done through the ever-shifting Palaces.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Ultimately, the story's central concepts were inspired by equivalent social changes he saw in modern society, particularly in Japan.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\" /> Hashino also described the central theme of the game as being about freedom and how the characters attain it.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> He wanted to make the game more \"thematically approachable\" for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that left its audience with a strong sense of [[catharsis]] and the inspiration to take on problems in their lives.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/><ref name=\"SilCath\"/>\n\nThe narrative of ''Persona 5'' was designed like an omnibus, with the antagonists pursued by the party changing regularly.<ref name=\"P5persona\"/> As inspiration, the development team has also cited three main stories: the Chinese novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', the Japanese crime movie ''Hakuchuu no Shikaku'', and the Spanish novel ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]''.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> Furthermore, the setting and style was compared to a [[Picaresque novel|picaresque fiction]]; the team originally asked the question of how a character like [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]] might win appeal in modern society.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> This picaresque theme was carried over into the aesthetics of Persona fusion and sacrifice, which were themed after styles of capital punishment.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> Having a more \"stereotypical\" theme enabled the team to create surprising story developments, mixing contemporary drama with the setting of the ''Persona'' series. The series' recurring motif of \"masks\" was used more overtly in the game's plot than previous entries as well,<ref name=\"SilP5Fam\"/> and the game's main locations were based heavily on their real-world counterparts.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nThe main characters, according to Hashino, share a mindset that they \"no longer have a place where they belong in society\": the events of the game give them a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Hashino stated that while the last few games were about the protagonists chasing the antagonists, ''Persona 5'' would instead more prominently feature the antagonists and phenomena caused by them chasing the protagonists during the latter's activities. The characters have been described as \"juvenile academics,\"<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> with their activities as thieves being part of the way they break from societal norms and express themselves. Adhering with this concept, the game's main aim was to show the characters finding the courage to go outside the normal limits of society as set by previous generations.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> In contrast to previous ''Persona'' casts, the party of ''Persona 5'' willingly embrace the unfolding unusual events in their role of masked vigilantes rather than being dragged into them.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> The cast was originally going to be larger with character Hifumi Togo becoming a Phantom Thief, but as the story was already very large, she was relegated to an optional role as part of the Confidant system.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> Technological advances such as [[smartphones]] and the use of [[social media]] were integrated into both the story and gameplay due to their growing prevalence in modern society and how the public responds to real-world scandals.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe characters' initial Personas ([[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin|Ars\u00e8ne]], [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], [[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]], [[Zorro]], [[Ishikawa Goemon|Goemon]], [[Pope Joan|Johanna]], [[Necronomicon]], [[Milady de Winter|Milady]], [[Robin Hood]]) were themed after outlaws and picaresque heroes to reflect the function and dominant suppressed passions forming the Palace, and also represent aspects of their owners' personalities.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> Joker's initial Persona was originally the German demon [[Mephistopheles]], but it was changed to Ars\u00e8ne as the latter character better fit the game's themes.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> The cast's alternate Personas ([[Satan]]ael, [[Sun Wukong|Seiten Taisei]], [[Hecate]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]], [[Susano-o|Kamu Susanoo]], [[Anat]], [[Prometheus]], [[Astarte]], [[Loki]]) are taken from mythical beings who act as tricksters or rebels.<ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> The three main inspirations behind Joker's alter ego were [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]], [[The Fiend with Twenty Faces]], and Japanese outlaw hero Ishikawa Goemon.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> The name of Joker's high school, \"Shujin\", was chosen because it was a [[homonym]] of {{nihongo|''Sh\u016bjin''|\u56da\u4eba}}, the Japanese word for \"prisoner\".<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaB\"/> Following a trend from earlier entries, the Velvet Room assistants are named after characters from the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]].<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe use of adults as antagonists was a more overt expression of narrative elements previously explored in ''Persona 4''. The relation to police activities was also carried over from ''Persona 4'', but this time with the role of protagonists and antagonists reversed.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\" /> Several writers have highlighted the parallels between the game's various antagonists and real incidents/figures in different sectors of Japanese society (e.g. political, corporate, academic), and how the game's story and characters serve as social commentary on life in Japan.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|title=The Real Japan Behind Persona 5|last=Gay|first=Elliot|date=May 12, 2017|website=Anime News Network|language=en|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630013134/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|archive-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's villains and protagonists were also constructed to be parallels of each other, both groups being misfits trying to shape a world they saw as unsatisfactory or corrupted. This was intended to create moral ambiguity about the Phantom Thieves' actions, causing the player to question their concept of justice and their mission as a whole.<ref name=\"4Gstory\" /> In addition, the way a vocal minority online could draw attention to and shift public opinion on events and scandals in the news was cited as an inspiration for the ambiguous nature of the Phantom Thieves' actions.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\" />\n\n===Art design===\n[[Shigenori Soejima]], who had worked on the last two main-series ''Persona'' games, returned as character designer.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, whose most notable work on earlier games included the [[user interface]] (UI) displays.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for by the rest of the team.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> As the team considered previous ''Persona'' games to be \"fun\" but not well marketed, they designed the UI in such a way as to attract a larger, more mainstream audience.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/> According to Soejima, he was working on prospective designs for the game while ''Persona 4'' was still in development, with his designs evolving as the story for ''Persona 5'' came together.<ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/> Aesthetically, the team felt that they were picking up where ''Persona 4'' left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> Following the respective thematic coloring of ''Persona 3'' and ''4''{{'s}} blue and yellow, ''Persona 5'' used red, which was chosen to a harsh feeling.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/><ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Because of this, Suto tested multiple font colors until settling on black and white, as it stood out best against it.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> There was also a wish, especially in the teaser image used for the game's announcement, which represented the main characters' being chained down by the rules of the modern world.<ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Soejima designed the logo to convey the high-speed existences of the young cast, while elements such as Joker's Persona Ars\u00e8ne were designed to appear old-fashioned by comparison. This presented challenges as Soejima needed to balance this with a strong sense of style.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The main aim for the game's environments was to create a sense of realism, with Tokyo being modeled after real locations.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Persona 5's In-Game Locations Compared To The Real World|url=https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|website=Kotaku|accessdate=January 27, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031184625/https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|archivedate=October 31, 2017}}</ref> When creating the UI, Hashino wanted to demonstrate how a shift in perspective could alter a dull life into an exciting one in the context of the story. Early UI designs were so \"aggressively animated\" that it obscured what was happening in the game. Because of this, the animations were toned down and text orientation was altered, toning down the UI's graphical elements to present a balance between user-friendliness and style.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/> Rather than the use of sub-colors for earlier entries, the UI used only the primary red, black and white colors aside from health and magic point meters, with the menus using a special moving 3D model of Joker which would change position depending on the selected menu.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/>\n\nThe first character sketches were submitted in 2012.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaB\"/> Soejima worked closely with Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> Due to being high school students, Soejima found it difficult to make each main character's uniform design distinctive, so he expressed their individuality through their thief costumes.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Joker's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. Joker needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall art style and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of ''Persona 5'' revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by Joker voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, Joker was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the \"phantom thief\" premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew Joker and main cast in a style similar to [[sh\u014dnen manga]], but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the ''Persona'' series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, Joker was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine him as the type of person who made plans but did not share them with others.<ref name=\"FamSoejima\"/> The Persona designs, being based on characters from literature, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/>\n\nThe game's animated [[cutscene]]s were produced by [[Production I.G]] and Domerica, and were directed and supervised by Toshiyuki Kono.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"Domerica\"/> Kono was contacted three and a half years before the game's completion by Hashino: faced with the project, Kono felt a great deal of pressure in his role. ''Persona 5'' was the first time Production I.G had worked on the series, though many staff at the studio were fans. Despite this, the studio did not change their standard animation process, focusing on characters as they had done for many of their previous projects. The most important part of the cutscenes was getting the character's expressions right, particularly when it came to the general-mute protagonist. The game's animated opening sequence was directed by [[Sayo Yamamoto]].<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/> The concept behind the characters figure skating around the environment was done as a visual symbolization of the game's overall theme, breaking free of an oppressive force, and was similar to her work in ''[[Yuri on Ice]]''.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The scene where Joker first summoned his Persona was requested by Atlus to appear \"wild\", which again was difficult to Joker's purpose as an extension of the player. The blue flame effects related to the Persona were not created with CGI, but hand-drawn by the animators. All the anime cutscenes together were estimated as containing over an hour of footage.<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's original score was composed, performed, and produced by series sound director [[Shoji Meguro]].<ref name=\"P5liners\"/> Further contributions, among other general sound design, was handled by Toshiki Konishi, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Ryota Kozuka; all of them having previously worked on the series as well.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Meguro was given full creative freedom to work on the soundtrack, with around 80% of the tracks used in the game being his, which lasted around three years in total.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Seven tracks were performed in English by Lyn Inaizumi, a [[jazz]] and [[soul music]] singer.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/><ref name=\"LynTwitter\"/> Her first performance in a video game, Inaizumi claimed that the most difficult part of her contributions was performing a rap segment in the opening theme, \"Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There\".<ref name=\"PSCmusic\"/> The lyrics were written by Benjamin Franklin, while the ending song, \"Hoshi To Bokura To\", had lyrics written in Japanese by Shigeo Komori.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/>\n\nTo express the game's mood, Meguro incorporated strong [[acid jazz]] elements into the score.<ref name=\"SilComposer\"/> He also aimed to make the music sound more realistic than previous ''Persona'' games, aiming to match the game's visuals.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Meguro also changed the way the music flowed when compared to the last two ''Persona'' games. Instead of the opening and ending themes being conglomerates of the overall score, he described the entire score as a single continuous work. A recurring musical element he included was described as a \"[[Solmization|do-la]]\" syllable: the opening used \"so la re mi\" on strings as a hook, which then led into the \"do-la\" syllable for other tracks, including the normal battle theme. While he was creating the music, Meguro received positive comments from Hashino when he made early tracks created for an internal demo.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/>\n\nA three-disc soundtrack was released in Japan by Mastard Records on January 17, 2017.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Upon its debut, the album reached fifth on the [[Oricon]] charts with sales of over 29,000.<ref name=\"P5OSToricon\"/> The album featured 110 tracks with commentary from the sound team, while the cover and [[liner note]] artwork were designed by Soejima.<ref name=\"P5AlbumInfo\"/> In addition to the soundtrack, a 19-track disc featuring a selection of the main themes from the game, ''Persona 5: Sounds of the Rebellion'', was released as part of the North American and European collector's edition bundle.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> The complete soundtrack later received a localized English release on [[iTunes]] on April 18, 2017, and on vinyl later that year by [[iam8bit]].<ref name=\"P5ostItunes\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Arif|first1=Shabana|title=Persona 5's complete soundtrack is available to pre-order on vinyl as a 6 LP deluxe edition for $175|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|website=VG24/7|accessdate=January 2, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102141737/https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|archivedate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Sega promotional models and Persona 5 title, Taipei Game Show 20170123.jpg|thumb|Promotion of ''Persona 5'' at the 2017 Taipei Game Show]]\n''Persona 5'' was first announced with a teaser trailer in 2013, alongside spin-off games ''[[Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Persona 4: Dancing All Night]]'', and the [[PlayStation 3]] [[Porting|port]] of ''[[Persona 4 Arena Ultimax]]''.<ref name=\"PolyPersona\" /> The game was originally announced for a late 2014 release exclusively for the PlayStation 3.

The game is chronologically the sixth installment in the ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series, which is part of the larger ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' franchise. It was released for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in Japan in September 2016 and worldwide in April 2017, where it was published by Atlus in Japan and North America and by [[Deep Silver]] in Europe and Australia. An expanded version featuring new content, '''''Persona 5 Royal''''',{{efn|Known as ''Persona 5: The Royal'' {{nihongo||\u30da\u30eb\u30bd\u30ca5 \u30b6\u30fb\u30ed\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb|Perusona Faibu Za Roiyaru}} in Japanese}} was released in Japan in October 2019 and worldwide in March 2020.\n\n''Persona 5'' takes place in modern-day [[Tokyo]] and follows [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] after his transfer to Shujin Academy due to being put on probation for an assault of which he was falsely accused. During a school year, he and other students awaken to special powers, becoming a group of secret [[vigilante]]s known as the [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]]. They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from humanity's subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous games in the series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as the [[Persona (series)#Personas|Persona]]. The game incorporates role-playing and [[dungeon crawl]]ing elements alongside [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] scenarios.\n\n''Persona 5'' was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus led by game director and producer [[Katsura Hashino]]. Along with Hashino, returning staff from earlier ''Persona'' games included character designer [[Shigenori Soejima]] and music composer [[Shoji Meguro]]. Preparatory work began during the development of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning after the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011. First announced in 2013, ''Persona 5'' was delayed from its original late 2014 release date due to the game not being fully finished. The game's themes revolved around attaining freedom from the limitations of modern society, while its story was strongly inspired by [[picaresque fiction]] and the party's Personas being based on well-known literary outlaws and rebels.\n\n''Persona 5'' was met with critical acclaim, with praise given to its visual presentation and art direction, cast, gameplay, and music. The game is considered to be one of the greatest role-playing games of all time and was nominated for and won multiple awards. The game shipped over three million copies worldwide by the end of 2019, making it the best-selling entry in the overall ''Megami Tensei'' franchise. Several other media, including two spin-off games, ''[[Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight]]'' and ''[[Persona 5 Scramble]]'', as well as manga and [[Persona 5: The Animation|anime adaptations]], have also been released. The game's cast has also made appearances in other games, such as Joker appearing as a playable character in the 2018 crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{See also|Persona (series)#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of the Persona series}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = vertical\n| footer = [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], the game's protagonist, has two alternating lifestyles: a normal student life ''(top)'', and adventures into otherworldly locations ''(bottom)''.\n| image1 = Persona 5 Classroom.jpg\n| width1 = 250\n| image2 = Persona 5 Palace Combat.jpg\n| width2 = 250\n}}\n''Persona 5'' is a [[role-playing video game]] where the player takes on the role of a high school student, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], who lives out a single year while attending school in modern-day [[Tokyo]]. The game is governed by a day-night cycle and weather systems that determine general behavior similar to a [[social simulation game]]. The year is punctuated by both scripted and random events as Joker attends school. He can perform part-time jobs and pursue leisure activities or create battle items. These various activities raise character attributes, which grant passive [[Status effect#Buffs|buffing]] effects during battle.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/> When in the real world, the main protagonist can develop character relationships known as ''Confidants''; an evolution of the ''Social Link'' system from ''[[Persona 3]]'' and ''[[Persona 4]]''. With this system, the main protagonist can converse with and improve his relationship with other characters he meets, with some leading to possible romances. Improving Confidant ranks with [[Party (role-playing games)|party]] members unlocks various abilities for use in combat, such as the \"Baton Pass\" ability, which allows the player to directly select another character after a critical hit while granting a temporary attack boost.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/> Improving ranks with non-party Confidants grant other bonuses, such as giving access to new [[Item (gaming)|items]] and equipment and boosting [[experience point]] and yen gain.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nAlongside the normal school life is [[dungeon crawl]]ing gameplay of two different types within a realm called the Metaverse: story-specific dungeons called Palaces and randomly-generated Mementos dungeons. Both are populated by Shadows, physical manifestations of suppressed psyches that are modeled after mythological and religious figures. Within Mementos dungeons, the party can fulfill requests from [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) received from a \"Confidant\" links.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> While navigating, the party uses stealth to avoid the sight of enemy Shadows, and some areas hold puzzles that can be solved using an insight ability known as \"Third Eye\",<ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/> which highlights interactable objects and enemy strength compared to the party. When exploring story-centered Palaces, an \"Alertness Meter\" is present, where the party being spotted or fleeing combat results in security being raised. If security reaches 100%, the party is forced to leave the Palace. The Alertness level can be lowered by launching surprise attacks on and eliminating enemies, and also lowers automatically overnight.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/> Throughout Palaces are locations known as \"safe rooms\". In them, the player can [[Saved game|save their game]], heal their party, and [[fast travel]] to other safe rooms within the Palace.\n\nAs with previous entries in the series, the game uses a [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Turn-based|turn-based]] combat system: battles can be initiated when the party runs into an enemy, or they can launch a surprise attack and gain an advantage in battle. In battle, the party has access to both melee and gun weapons, in addition to being able to summon Personas, manifestations of the main characters' inner psyche used mainly for special attacks.<ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5FamBattle\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"ShackMasks\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |title=Persona 5 Royal New PS4 Game 2020?? |last=Teja|first=Ravi |publisher=Raviteja|date=March 4, 2020 |accessdate=March 4, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830213249/https://www.gamexeed.com/2020/03/persona-5-royal-new-ps4-game-2020.html |archivedate=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"ShackMasks\"/> If a character strikes an enemy's weakness, they knock the enemy down and are awarded an additional turn. If all enemies are knocked down, a \"Hold Up\" is triggered. During one, the party can launch a devastating \"All-Out Attack\", demand money or items, or enter a negotiation. Negotiation allows Joker to win the selected Shadow over to their side to become a new Persona: they can only be persuaded to join if Joker is their level or higher.<ref name=\"RPGgameplay\"/><ref name=\"PolyGameplay\"/><ref name=\"DigiGameplay\"/> Similar to previous entries, party members can be knocked out, and if the main character is knocked out, the game ends. At times, if a party member is knocked out, they can be captured by enemy Shadows, and is unable to return to the party if the resultant negotiation fails.<ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\nNew Personas are gained from battle through successful negotiation, and different Persona types are represented through different arcana linked to Confidant links. Personas can be combined, or \"fused\", or otherwise further manipulated within the Velvet Room, a realm Joker visits as part of his journey through the story.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/><ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/> In the Velvet Room, Personas can be fused with \"Guillotine\" fusion processes, with the resultant Persona inheriting skills and stats from its parents. The more skills a Persona has, the more are passed on to the fused Persona. How powerful Personas are through fusion depends on how advanced its associated Confidant link is. Also, Personas can be sacrificed in various ways, also styled after styles of capital punishment: \"Hanging\" grants a sacrificed Persona's experience points to another chosen Persona, and \"Electric Chair\" sacrifice one to create a high-end item. A Persona can also be sent into \"Solitary Confinement\", where they undergo intensive training and gain additional skills quicker than normal. The number of days a Persona must remain to gain strength lessens based on its arcana strength.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/>\n\nMinor multiplayer elements are incorporated into the game through the \"Thieves Guild\" feature. Similar to the \"Vox Populi\" system from ''Persona 4 Golden'', players have the option of seeing what activities other players did during any given day. Players can send messages to each other, in addition to affecting the Alertness meter in the player's favor, and aiding in battle when a party member is taken hostage by an enemy.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/><ref name=\"P5gameplayBits\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting and characters===\n{{Main Article|List of Persona 5 characters}}\n''Persona 5'' takes place within the ''Persona'' universe, revolving around a group of high school students who harness Personas, physical manifestations of their inner psyche.<ref name=\"GIpersona\"/> ''Persona 5'' is set in modern-day Tokyo, in April of the year \"20XX\", with navigable real-world locations within the city including [[Akihabara]], [[Shinjuku]] and [[Shibuya]].<ref name=\"P5year\"/> Alongside larger environments, there are specific locations that can be entered, such as shops, restaurants and movie theaters. A major setting throughout the game is Shujin Academy, a high school that the protagonist attends.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/> The second major location is the \"Metaverse\", a supernatural realm consisting of the physical manifestation of humanity's subconscious desires. In the Metaverse, people with corrupted enough desires form their own unique \"Palace\", which is modeled after their distorted perception of the world, along with a Shadow version of themselves possessing a \"Treasure\" symbolic of their desires.<ref name=\"FamTokyo\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"PMythDetail\"/> Returning from earlier entries is the Velvet Room, a place that exists for the growth of Persona users that shifts appearance depending on the current guest: in ''Persona 5'', it takes the form of a prison.<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe [[player character]] is a [[silent protagonist]], a commonplace feature in other ''Persona'' games, codenamed [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]]. He becomes the leader of a [[vigilante]] group known as the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, who change the hearts of criminals and other malevolent people through the Metaverse.<ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> He forms it with Morgana, a mysterious cat-like creature who serves as the Thieves' second-in-command, who wants to discover his origins and restore his true form. Other founding members include school delinquent Ryuji Sakamoto and fashion model Ann Takamaki. More people join the group throughout the game, including art prodigy Yusuke Kitagawa, student council president [[Makoto Niijima]], [[hikikomori]] computer hacker Futaba Sakura, and cultured corporate heiress Haru Okumura.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Also interacting with Joker are Goro Akechi, a high school detective; Sae Niijima, public prosecutor and Makoto's older sister; and the residents of the Velvet Room, Igor and his two assistants Caroline and Justine.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"KotakuLysis\"/> Joker also has interactions with other confidants, including his caretaker and Futaba's adoptive father Sojiro Sakura, classmate Yuuki Mishima, his teacher and part-time maid Sadayo Kawakami, arcade gamer Shinya Oda, journalist Ichiko Ohya, [[fortune teller]] Chihaya Mifune, [[shogi]] master Hifumi Togo, doctor Tae Takemi, politician Toranosuke Yoshida, and [[model gun]] store owner Munehisa Iwai.\n\n===Plot===\nAfter Joker defends a woman from being abused by a drunken man on the street, he is falsely charged with assault and put on [[probation]], resulting in expulsion from his school. Joker is sent to Tokyo to stay with his family associate Sojiro Sakura and attend Shujin Academy during his year-long probation. After his arrival, he is drawn into the Velvet Room, where Igor warns him that he must \"rehabilitate\" to avoid forthcoming ruin, and grants him access to a supernatural mobile app that leads Joker into the Metaverse and the Palace of the school's abusive volleyball coach Suguru Kamoshida. Joker meets Morgana, who informs him of the ability to change wicked people's hearts by stealing their \"Treasure\", the emotional root of their behavior, from the Palaces ruled by their Shadow selves. After successfully reforming Kamoshida, Ryuji, Joker, Ann, and Morgana form the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, stealing corruption from the hearts of adults to reform the city.\n\nAs the number of the Phantom Thieves' members and successes grows, they attract the attention of the public and police, including public prosecutor Sae Niijima and detective prodigy Goro Akechi. The Phantom Thieves learn that another secret group, including a black-masked assassin, is using the Metaverse to murder their targets and then framing the Phantom Thieves of Hearts for the killings. In pursuit of the conspiracy, the group is joined by Akechi, who is subsequently revealed to be the black-masked assassin. Escaping into hiding with Sae's help, the Phantom Thieves deduce that the conspiracy's leader is politician Masayoshi Shido, who has been using Akechi's ability to infiltrate the Metaverse to remove obstacles to his becoming Prime Minister and imposing his reforms on Japan, as well as the one who pressed assault charges against Joker. When the Phantom Thieves infiltrate Shido's Palace, they face Akechi, who reveals himself to be Shido's illegitimate son. He also reveals that he has been secretly plotting to exact his revenge on Shido for years of neglect and summons his true Persona: Loki. Once defeated, Akechi sacrifices himself to protect the Phantom Thieves from a group of enemies, allowing them to escape and reach Shido.\n\nDespite Shido's arrest and confession after his change of heart, the public remains uninterested and has lost trust in both authority and the Phantom Thieves. In response, the Phantom Thieves make a final heist to infiltrate the depths of Mementos and steal the treasure at its core. Inside, they discover that the public is in chaos and has chosen to give up their autonomy. The Phantom Thieves are then ejected from Mementos by the Treasure, taking form as the Holy Grail, and vanish after witnessing the Metaverse merge with reality. Waking in the Velvet Room, Joker confronts Igor, Caroline, and Justine. Caroline and Justine regain their memories and merge into Lavenza, their true form. Lavenza reveals the Igor Joker has been seeing in the Velvet room up until this point to be an imposter who imprisoned the real Igor. The imposter is then revealed to be [[Yaldabaoth]], the Holy Grail, who was created from humanity's wish to give up control. Through a bet made with Igor over humanity's goals, Yaldabaoth had given Joker and Akechi their abilities to see whether the world would be preserved or be destroyed through their actions, all while steering the game in his favor.\n\nJoker rejects Yaldabaoth's offer to return to his world at the cost of his freedom, and he, along with the rest of the Phantom Thieves, fight him. Joker's confidants rally the popular support of the people, rebelling against Yaldabaoth's control of humanity and allowing Joker to awaken his ultimate persona to destroy Yaldabaoth and the Metaverse. After Yaldabaoth's defeat, in order for Shido to be prosecuted, Joker must turn himself into the police. While Joker is incarcerated, the rest of the Phantom Thieves and his confidants successfully help secure evidence of Joker's innocence in the assault charge, leading to his conviction being overturned. By spring, Joker's friends drive him back to his hometown.\n\n===''Royal''===\nIn ''Persona 5 Royal'', two new characters interact with the Phantom Thieves: Kasumi Yoshizawa, an accomplished rhythmic gymnast who transferred to Shujin at the same time as the protagonist, and Takuto Maruki, a school counselor hired after Kamoshida is exposed. Kasumi awakens to her Persona after calling the protagonist to a new Palace in Odaiba that quickly vanishes. Maruki, in turn, talks to each of the Phantom Thieves, learning their deepest wishes. After defeating Yaldabaoth, the still-living Akechi turns himself over to Sae in the protagonist's place. At the beginning of the following year, the protagonist finds reality distorted; Akechi was released without reason, and each Phantom Thief member has had their deepest wish granted. The protagonist and Akechi, together with the also-aware Kasumi, return to the Odaiba Palace and investigate. The Palace's master is Maruki, who reveals that \"Kasumi\" is Sumire, sister to the original Kasumi, who died in a car accident saving Sumire.\n\nMaruki can use his Persona to alter a person's reality, with his first use of it being to make his then-girlfriend forget her parents' murder. Yaldabaoth's manipulation of the world drove Maruki and his Persona over the edge, and they became the new controllers of Mementos and warped all reality into a dream-like ideal. Sumire turns against the protagonist to protect her identity as \"Kasumi.\" The protagonist snaps his friends out of Maruki's reality, then frees Sumire from his influence. Depending on player choices, it is revealed that Akechi's survival is dependant on the new reality, and Maruki offers the protagonist the option of accepting it to save Akechi. Refusing the offer, the reformed Phantom Thieves, including Akechi and Sumire, defeat Maruki. Reality returns to normal, and with Akechi missing and the protagonist in prison.\n\nOn their final meeting after the protagonist's release, each member of the Phantom Thieves chooses to pursue their dreams within the current reality. On the day he is due to return home, the protagonist escapes tailing government agents with help from both the Phantom Thieves and a reformed Maruki. At the station, Sumire bids him farewell. If Akechi's confidant level is at its highest, and with the right dialogue choices, a man wearing Akechi's clothes is briefly seen passing through the train window that the protagonist is riding.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was developed by P-Studio, an internal development studio within Atlus dedicated to handling the ''Persona'' series. Preparatory development of the game began in 2008, following the release of ''[[Persona 4]]'', with full development beginning following the release of ''[[Catherine (video game)|Catherine]]'' in 2011.<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/><ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Hashino was only fully involved in development after ''Catherine'' was finished, later calling the latter game a test for the next ''Persona'' game's development. Development lasted five years.<ref name=\"PersonaBlog\"/><ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> ''Persona 5'' would be Hashino's last game in the series as the leader of P-Studio, as he would afterwards form a separate internal team called Studio Zero.<ref name=\"P5studioA\"/><ref name=\"P5studioB\"/> When production started, the staff consisted of around 40 people. During full production, this number expanded to 70: 15 planners, 15 programmers, and between 30 and 45 designers. These included the game's lead designer Naoya Maeda, who had previously done modeling work for the ''[[Trauma Center (video game series)|Trauma Center]]'' series. The general development was a challenge for the team, as they intentionally changed their development structure due to the more powerful hardware they were working with.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/>\n\nWhile the final game retained the turn-based system from earlier entries, one of the early design drafts was for an action-based system incorporating real-time elements foreign to the series. This idea was ultimately scrapped, but real-time command elements were introduced into the battle system, allowing the gameplay to evolve without extensive changes to the core system.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> A major new addition was the inclusions of unique dungeons with locked layouts as opposed to the dominant randomly generated dungeons of previous ''Persona'' games. This was done to both emulate the game's themes and provide veteran players with something different.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\"/> A returning feature from both earlier ''Persona'' games and the mainline ''[[Megami Tensei]]'' series was Negotiation: as it was considered a key part of the overall franchise by fans, Hashino decided to reintroduce it after being absent from the previous two mainline entries. The Negotiation system for ''Persona 5'' was tied into the origins of Shadows as suppressed psyches within the Collective Unconscious. The \"Hold Up\" function was inspired by scenes in films where the antagonist would hold people at gunpoint and make demands. These functions were incorporated due to the game being in part a celebration of the series' history.<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> While designing the gameplay elements, the weather, and environmental elements were all designed to reflect the real world. Dungeon layout was split into three distinct types: the Tokyo overworld environments, \"institutions\" such as Joker's high school, and dungeon environments.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Some segments took control away from the player aside from limited dialogue choices; this was chosen as it reflected the controlled environment of Japanese high schoolers.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/>\n\nWhile ''Catherine'' used the third-party [[Gamebryo]] [[game engine]], ''Persona 5'' used a specially-created engine. Hashino believed that the new engine would make rendering their ideas much easier, although it would result in a long wait by fans for the game.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaA\"/><ref name=\"CathBryon\"/> The event scene software was also developed internally by Atlus, with an estimated 1,160 being featured in the final game. The tools for developing and handling them were greatly expanded over the previous two entries to properly communicate them to players on the more advanced hardware.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> Character modeling, in general, was handled with a specially-developed toon shader which helped properly translate the character designs into the game, while also allowing for easy adjustment of shaders and lighting effects during fine-tuning.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> The characters were originally rendered realistically like in ''Catherine'', but the team felt that it was \"wrong\" for the ''Persona'' series. With this in mind, the team did some trial and error before finding a style that satisfied them, doing something similar for the interface and menu design.<ref name=\"P5magazine\"/> In contrast to ''Persona 4'', which had a general deformed look to hardware limitations on the variety of body shapes, the technology available to the team for ''Persona 5'' enabled unique customization for all relevant character models. Two different models were used for members of the main cast: a detailed model for real-time cutscenes, and a general-use model for general event scenes and gameplay.<ref name=\"CGMagInterview\"/> ''Persona 5'' was the first time a large number of Personas had been rendered in high definition, something which proved a grueling challenge for the team.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/>\n\n===Story and themes===\nThe original story concept was written by Hashino, while the scenario was co-written by Shinji Yamamoto and Yuichiro Tanaka.<ref name=\"P5credits\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/> The initial concept was for a storyline that diverged from the established paths of ''Persona 3'' and ''Persona 4'', with \"self-discovery\" and \"journey\" being its keywords.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Originally using the concept of a [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking trip]] around the world as a framing device for the story, Hashino decided to refocus on Japan in the wake of the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]].<ref name=\"4Gstory\"/> More specifically, it has been noted that the Japanese government's actions in response to the earthquake and tsunami's fallout, along with Japanese citizens' reactions to how the government acted during that time, may have served as partial influences on the game's themes.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|title=The Real-World Problems Behind Persona 5|last=McCarthy|first=Caty|date=May 5, 2017|website=USgamer|language=en|access-date=June 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603100720/https://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-real-world-problems-behind-persona-5|archive-date=June 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following that crisis and seeing how people were bonding in the face of it, Hashino decided to have the story take place solely in Japan, with the journeying being done through the ever-shifting Palaces.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\"/> Ultimately, the story's central concepts were inspired by equivalent social changes he saw in modern society, particularly in Japan.<ref name=\"PMythDetail\" /> Hashino also described the central theme of the game as being about freedom and how the characters attain it.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> He wanted to make the game more \"thematically approachable\" for newcomers to the series, and to be an emotional experience that left its audience with a strong sense of [[catharsis]] and the inspiration to take on problems in their lives.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/><ref name=\"SilCath\"/>\n\nThe narrative of ''Persona 5'' was designed like an omnibus, with the antagonists pursued by the party changing regularly.<ref name=\"P5persona\"/> As inspiration, the development team has also cited three main stories: the Chinese novel ''[[Water Margin]]'', the Japanese crime movie ''Hakuchuu no Shikaku'', and the Spanish novel ''[[Lazarillo de Tormes]]''.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> Furthermore, the setting and style was compared to a [[Picaresque novel|picaresque fiction]]; the team originally asked the question of how a character like [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin III]] might win appeal in modern society.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> This picaresque theme was carried over into the aesthetics of Persona fusion and sacrifice, which were themed after styles of capital punishment.<ref name=\"SilGameplayPersonas\"/> Having a more \"stereotypical\" theme enabled the team to create surprising story developments, mixing contemporary drama with the setting of the ''Persona'' series. The series' recurring motif of \"masks\" was used more overtly in the game's plot than previous entries as well,<ref name=\"SilP5Fam\"/> and the game's main locations were based heavily on their real-world counterparts.<ref name=\"P5FamGameplay\"/>\n\nThe main characters, according to Hashino, share a mindset that they \"no longer have a place where they belong in society\": the events of the game give them a sense of belonging.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> Hashino stated that while the last few games were about the protagonists chasing the antagonists, ''Persona 5'' would instead more prominently feature the antagonists and phenomena caused by them chasing the protagonists during the latter's activities. The characters have been described as \"juvenile academics,\"<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> with their activities as thieves being part of the way they break from societal norms and express themselves. Adhering with this concept, the game's main aim was to show the characters finding the courage to go outside the normal limits of society as set by previous generations.<ref name=\"GemHashino\"/> In contrast to previous ''Persona'' casts, the party of ''Persona 5'' willingly embrace the unfolding unusual events in their role of masked vigilantes rather than being dragged into them.<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/> The cast was originally going to be larger with character Hifumi Togo becoming a Phantom Thief, but as the story was already very large, she was relegated to an optional role as part of the Confidant system.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> Technological advances such as [[smartphones]] and the use of [[social media]] were integrated into both the story and gameplay due to their growing prevalence in modern society and how the public responds to real-world scandals.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe characters' initial Personas ([[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin|Ars\u00e8ne]], [[William Kidd|Captain Kidd]], [[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]], [[Zorro]], [[Ishikawa Goemon|Goemon]], [[Pope Joan|Johanna]], [[Necronomicon]], [[Milady de Winter|Milady]], [[Robin Hood]]) were themed after outlaws and picaresque heroes to reflect the function and dominant suppressed passions forming the Palace, and also represent aspects of their owners' personalities.<ref name=\"GemCharactersB\"/><ref name=\"GemCharactersA\"/><ref name=\"P5persona\"/><ref name=\"GIinterview\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> Joker's initial Persona was originally the German demon [[Mephistopheles]], but it was changed to Ars\u00e8ne as the latter character better fit the game's themes.<ref name=\"PSCsecrets\"/> The cast's alternate Personas ([[Satan]]ael, [[Sun Wukong|Seiten Taisei]], [[Hecate]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]], [[Susano-o|Kamu Susanoo]], [[Anat]], [[Prometheus]], [[Astarte]], [[Loki]]) are taken from mythical beings who act as tricksters or rebels.<ref name=\"Persona5Maniacus\"/><ref name=\"Persona5Artbook\"/> The three main inspirations behind Joker's alter ego were [[Ars\u00e8ne Lupin]], [[The Fiend with Twenty Faces]], and Japanese outlaw hero Ishikawa Goemon.<ref name=\"PMinspiration\"/> The name of Joker's high school, \"Shujin\", was chosen because it was a [[homonym]] of {{nihongo|''Sh\u016bjin''|\u56da\u4eba}}, the Japanese word for \"prisoner\".<ref name=\"KotakuPersonaB\"/> Following a trend from earlier entries, the Velvet Room assistants are named after characters from the novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' by [[Mary Shelley]].<ref name=\"PSeriesInfo\"/>\n\nThe use of adults as antagonists was a more overt expression of narrative elements previously explored in ''Persona 4''. The relation to police activities was also carried over from ''Persona 4'', but this time with the role of protagonists and antagonists reversed.<ref name=\"PSblogHashino\" /> Several writers have highlighted the parallels between the game's various antagonists and real incidents/figures in different sectors of Japanese society (e.g. political, corporate, academic), and how the game's story and characters serve as social commentary on life in Japan.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|title=The Real Japan Behind Persona 5|last=Gay|first=Elliot|date=May 12, 2017|website=Anime News Network|language=en|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630013134/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2017-05-12/the-real-japan-behind-persona-5/.116021|archive-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The game's villains and protagonists were also constructed to be parallels of each other, both groups being misfits trying to shape a world they saw as unsatisfactory or corrupted. This was intended to create moral ambiguity about the Phantom Thieves' actions, causing the player to question their concept of justice and their mission as a whole.<ref name=\"4Gstory\" /> In addition, the way a vocal minority online could draw attention to and shift public opinion on events and scandals in the news was cited as an inspiration for the ambiguous nature of the Phantom Thieves' actions.<ref name=\"USGp5Interview\" />\n\n===Art design===\n[[Shigenori Soejima]], who had worked on the last two main-series ''Persona'' games, returned as character designer.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> The game's art director was Masayoshi Suto, whose most notable work on earlier games included the [[user interface]] (UI) displays.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> The art design reflected the picaresque theme aimed for by the rest of the team.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> As the team considered previous ''Persona'' games to be \"fun\" but not well marketed, they designed the UI in such a way as to attract a larger, more mainstream audience.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/> According to Soejima, he was working on prospective designs for the game while ''Persona 4'' was still in development, with his designs evolving as the story for ''Persona 5'' came together.<ref name=\"RPGSinterview\"/> Aesthetically, the team felt that they were picking up where ''Persona 4'' left off. Its styling presentation was an unintentional reflection on the hurdles the team needed to overcome during development.<ref name= \"P5magazine\"/> Following the respective thematic coloring of ''Persona 3'' and ''4''{{'s}} blue and yellow, ''Persona 5'' used red, which was chosen to a harsh feeling.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/><ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Because of this, Suto tested multiple font colors until settling on black and white, as it stood out best against it.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/> There was also a wish, especially in the teaser image used for the game's announcement, which represented the main characters' being chained down by the rules of the modern world.<ref name=\"GematsuFreedom\"/> Soejima designed the logo to convey the high-speed existences of the young cast, while elements such as Joker's Persona Ars\u00e8ne were designed to appear old-fashioned by comparison. This presented challenges as Soejima needed to balance this with a strong sense of style.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The main aim for the game's environments was to create a sense of realism, with Tokyo being modeled after real locations.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Persona 5's In-Game Locations Compared To The Real World|url=https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|website=Kotaku|accessdate=January 27, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031184625/https://kotaku.com/persona-5s-in-game-locations-compared-to-the-real-world-1787125885|archivedate=October 31, 2017}}</ref> When creating the UI, Hashino wanted to demonstrate how a shift in perspective could alter a dull life into an exciting one in the context of the story. Early UI designs were so \"aggressively animated\" that it obscured what was happening in the game. Because of this, the animations were toned down and text orientation was altered, toning down the UI's graphical elements to present a balance between user-friendliness and style.<ref name=\"P5hashinoUI\"/> Rather than the use of sub-colors for earlier entries, the UI used only the primary red, black and white colors aside from health and magic point meters, with the menus using a special moving 3D model of Joker which would change position depending on the selected menu.<ref name=\"P5cedecUI\"/>\n\nThe first character sketches were submitted in 2012.<ref name=\"AndriaPersonaB\"/> Soejima worked closely with Hashino so the characters and environments reflected the game's themes.<ref name=\"Persona5Theme\"/> Due to being high school students, Soejima found it difficult to make each main character's uniform design distinctive, so he expressed their individuality through their thief costumes.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Joker's design was cited by Soejima as his most challenging recent work. Joker needed to both convey a taste of the game's overall art style and to act as an avatar for the player. As the main theme and narrative of ''Persona 5'' revolved around crime and vigilantes triggered by Joker voluntarily choosing that path, Soejima needed to convey this while allowing the character to suit whatever dialogue choices the player decided upon. Due to these difficulties, Joker was given multiple designs in a trial and error process to find the best one. As the \"phantom thief\" premise was a common stereotype in fiction, Soejima initially drew Joker and main cast in a style similar to [[sh\u014dnen manga]], but these designs were scrapped as they clashed with the ''Persona'' series' realistic aesthetics. As with previous entries, Joker was a silent character, so as with previous protagonist Soejima had to work out a way he could communicate without dialogue. His solution was to imagine him as the type of person who made plans but did not share them with others.<ref name=\"FamSoejima\"/> The Persona designs, being based on characters from literature, were intended to evoke both familiarity and surprise from players. Once the names were chosen, Soejima designed the Personas based on that character.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/>\n\nThe game's animated [[cutscene]]s were produced by [[Production I.G]] and Domerica, and were directed and supervised by Toshiyuki Kono.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/><ref name=\"Domerica\"/> Kono was contacted three and a half years before the game's completion by Hashino: faced with the project, Kono felt a great deal of pressure in his role. ''Persona 5'' was the first time Production I.G had worked on the series, though many staff at the studio were fans. Despite this, the studio did not change their standard animation process, focusing on characters as they had done for many of their previous projects. The most important part of the cutscenes was getting the character's expressions right, particularly when it came to the general-mute protagonist. The game's animated opening sequence was directed by [[Sayo Yamamoto]].<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/> The concept behind the characters figure skating around the environment was done as a visual symbolization of the game's overall theme, breaking free of an oppressive force, and was similar to her work in ''[[Yuri on Ice]]''.<ref name=\"GemDetails\"/> The scene where Joker first summoned his Persona was requested by Atlus to appear \"wild\", which again was difficult to Joker's purpose as an extension of the player. The blue flame effects related to the Persona were not created with CGI, but hand-drawn by the animators. All the anime cutscenes together were estimated as containing over an hour of footage.<ref name=\"P5FamIG\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's original score was composed, performed, and produced by series sound director [[Shoji Meguro]].<ref name=\"P5liners\"/> Further contributions, among other general sound design, was handled by Toshiki Konishi, Kenichi Tsuchiya, Atsushi Kitajoh, and Ryota Kozuka; all of them having previously worked on the series as well.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/><ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Meguro was given full creative freedom to work on the soundtrack, with around 80% of the tracks used in the game being his, which lasted around three years in total.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Seven tracks were performed in English by Lyn Inaizumi, a [[jazz]] and [[soul music]] singer.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/><ref name=\"P5Album\"/><ref name=\"LynTwitter\"/> Her first performance in a video game, Inaizumi claimed that the most difficult part of her contributions was performing a rap segment in the opening theme, \"Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There\".<ref name=\"PSCmusic\"/> The lyrics were written by Benjamin Franklin, while the ending song, \"Hoshi To Bokura To\", had lyrics written in Japanese by Shigeo Komori.<ref name=\"P5liners\"/>\n\nTo express the game's mood, Meguro incorporated strong [[acid jazz]] elements into the score.<ref name=\"SilComposer\"/> He also aimed to make the music sound more realistic than previous ''Persona'' games, aiming to match the game's visuals.<ref name=\"Meguro/Soejima\"/> Meguro also changed the way the music flowed when compared to the last two ''Persona'' games. Instead of the opening and ending themes being conglomerates of the overall score, he described the entire score as a single continuous work. A recurring musical element he included was described as a \"[[Solmization|do-la]]\" syllable: the opening used \"so la re mi\" on strings as a hook, which then led into the \"do-la\" syllable for other tracks, including the normal battle theme. While he was creating the music, Meguro received positive comments from Hashino when he made early tracks created for an internal demo.<ref name=\"FamMusicArt\"/>\n\nA three-disc soundtrack was released in Japan by Mastard Records on January 17, 2017.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> Upon its debut, the album reached fifth on the [[Oricon]] charts with sales of over 29,000.<ref name=\"P5OSToricon\"/> The album featured 110 tracks with commentary from the sound team, while the cover and [[liner note]] artwork were designed by Soejima.<ref name=\"P5AlbumInfo\"/> In addition to the soundtrack, a 19-track disc featuring a selection of the main themes from the game, ''Persona 5: Sounds of the Rebellion'', was released as part of the North American and European collector's edition bundle.<ref name=\"P5Album\"/> The complete soundtrack later received a localized English release on [[iTunes]] on April 18, 2017, and on vinyl later that year by [[iam8bit]].<ref name=\"P5ostItunes\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Arif|first1=Shabana|title=Persona 5's complete soundtrack is available to pre-order on vinyl as a 6 LP deluxe edition for $175|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|website=VG24/7|accessdate=January 2, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102141737/https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/01/persona-5s-complete-soundtrack-is-available-to-pre-order-on-vinyl-as-a-6-lp-deluxe-edition-for-175/|archivedate=January 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Sega promotional models and Persona 5 title, Taipei Game Show 20170123.jpg|thumb|Promotion of ''Persona 5'' at the 2017 Taipei Game Show]]\n''Persona 5'' was first announced with a teaser trailer in 2013, alongside spin-off games ''[[Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Persona 4: Dancing All Night]]'', and the [[PlayStation 3]] [[Porting|port]] of ''[[Persona 4 Arena Ultimax]]''.<ref name=\"PolyPersona\" /> The game was originally announced for a late 2014 release exclusively for the PlayStation 3.

According to director Katsura Hashino, the game was delayed to fully develop for the PlayStation 4, and improve the general quality of the game for both versions.<ref name=\"PersonaPS4\" /> The game's first gameplay trailer was revealed during a special livestream on February 5, 2015. A [[Blu-ray Disc]] containing an exclusive trailer for the game was bundled with first print copies of ''Persona 4: Dancing All Night'' in Japan on June 25, 2015.<ref name=\"ANNreveal\" /> The song used in the first gameplay trailer was an instrumental version of the main theme.<ref name=\"SilComposer\" /> During a special livestream for the game at the 2015 [[Tokyo Game Show]], it was announced that the game would be delayed once again to late 2016.<ref name=\"GIdelay\" /> Speaking in a staff interview, Hashino apologized for the delay and stated that it was necessary to deliver a high-quality product without having to hold back in terms of content.<ref name=\"PersonaDelay\" />\n\nIn April 2016, Atlus launched an official countdown relating to the game that counted down to May 5, 2016. Shortly after, a special [[livestream]] was announced titled ''Take Tokyo Tower'', which would coincide with the countdown date.

Following the cancellation of the tour, [[Robin Gibb]] told the press that the group was working on an album of acoustic versions of songs they had written for other artists. The project was later called ''Love Songs'', which featured some new recordings and was announced as the Bee Gees' new album in September 1994 and planned for release on 14 February (Valentine's Day) of 1995. However, their record company rejected the album.<ref name=\"rejected\">{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/94.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1994 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nAround 1994, the Bee Gees did record six songs, one of which was called \"Miracles Happen\" which was written and recorded to be the title song for a new film version of ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]''; the Bee Gees got the job in June 1994 and quickly returned this recording, with a boys\u2019 choir and a big string section backing them. The filmmakers however decided later to use only old Christmas songs. On the same session, they also did their own version of their compositions such as \"[[Emotion (Samantha Sang song)|Emotion]]\" ([[Samantha Sang]]), \"[[Heartbreaker (Dionne Warwick song)|Heartbreaker]]\" ([[Dionne Warwick]]), \"Love Never Dies\" and \"Rings Around the Moon\", which were later released as B-sides.<ref name=\"rejected\"/>\n\n==Recording==\nIn July 1995, they started with seven demos for what would become included on the album, along with four demos recorded in the second quarter of 1995. In the October 1995 sessions they recorded their rendition of \"[[Will You Love Me Tomorrow]]\" for a [[Carole King]] tribute album ''[[Tapestry Revisited: A Tribute to Carole King]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/95.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1995 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1996, they relocated to [[The Hit Factory]] in New York to record two songs. Around 1996, the Bee Gees used session musicians to complete the entire album, produced by [[Russ Titelman]]. Also in 1996, the Bee Gees recorded two songs with two members of [[P.M. Dawn]], Attrel Cordes and Jarett Cordes. The producer on \"With My Eyes Closed\" was [[Raphael Saadiq]]. \"[[Still Waters (Run Deep)]]\" was produced by [[Hugh Padgham]]. The last song recorded for the album was \"Closer than Close\" which features [[Maurice Gibb]]'s lead vocals produced by the brothers themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/96.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1996 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n{{Album reviews\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r261428|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n| rev2score = {{Rating|2.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-06-06/entertainment/9706060042_1_bee-gees-whitney-houston-album-ballads|last=Caro|first=Mark|work=chicagotribune.com|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|title=Review: Bee Gees Still Waters|date=6 June 1997|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev3Score = (C)<ref name=\"EW_review\">{{cite web|last=Schinder|first=Scott|title=''Still Waters'' Review|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,287805,00.html|work=ew.com|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=9 May 1997|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''\n| rev4score = {{Rating|2|4}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-10/entertainment/ca-57367_1_bee-gees-show|last=Gardner|first=Elysa|work=articles.latimes.com|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|title=Bee Gees Show Just a Glimmer of Old Magic|date=10 May 1997|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev5Score = {{rating|2|5}}<ref>{{Cite web|last=Moon|first=Tom|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622144804/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thebeegees/albums/album/112063/review/5944463/still_waters|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thebeegees/albums/album/112063/review/5944463/still_waters|archivedate=22 June 2008|date=22 April 1997|accessdate=16 April 2008|title=Music Review: ''Still Waters'' by the Bee Gees}}</ref>\n}}\nThe Bee Gees recorded further new songs in 1996 and 1997, and ''Still Waters'' was released in March 1997. Though receiving lukewarm reviews from critics, the album was their most successful album in almost twenty years; it was released at a time when the Bee Gees were being awarded for lifetime achievements, had recently been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and were regaining high exposure on television, particularly [[VH1]]. The album sold over 5 million copies worldwide,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} peaking at No. 2 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and reaching No. 11 in the United States. The Bee Gees made the album with a variety of top producers, including [[Russ Titelman]], [[David Foster]], [[Hugh Padgham]], and [[Arif Mardin]]. The first single off the album, \"[[Alone (Bee Gees song)|Alone]]\", was a worldwide hit, peaking at No. 5 in the UK and No. 28 in the United States, where it began as a \"hot shot debut\" at No. 34. \"[[I Could Not Love You More]]\" and \"[[Still Waters (Run Deep)]]\" also reached the UK top 20.\n\nIn a special agreement with [[Target Corporation|Target]], Polydor also sold a special edition of the album which included a bonus CD of songs from their ''VH1 Storytellers'' concert. This CD has never been made commercially available outside of the Target agreement.\n\n==Reception==\n\u201cThere is life in the old dog yet! The water is still flowing in the river under the family name of [[Bee Gees]]! The brothers [[Barry Gibb|Barry]], [[Maurice Gibb|Maurice]], and [[Robin Gibb]] did their best once again, for the umpteenth time, or rather to be even said, in their own style, as always,\u201d the album left a very good impression on the stuff of the newspaper \u201c''[[Muzykalnaya Gazeta]]''\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1997|orig-year=1997|title=\u041e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440 Bee Gees Still Waters|trans-title=Review of Still Waters by Bee Gees|url=http://www.nestor.minsk.by/mg/1997/26/mg72646.html|url-status=live|journal=[[Muzykalnaya Gazeta]]|language=ru|issue=26|pages=|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20190930034031/http://www.nestor.minsk.by/mg/1997/26/mg72646.html|archivedate=2019-09-30|via=|accessdate=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn 2003 [[Robin Gibb]] re-recorded the track \"My Lover's Prayer\" as a duet with [[Alistair Griffin]]. This reached No. 5 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] as a double A-side single with Griffin's solo recording of \"[[Bring It On (Alistair Griffin song)|Bring It On]]\". It also appears on Griffin's debut album ''[[Bring It On (Alistair Griffin album)|Bring It On]]'', which reached No. 12 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe album became one of the first of the Bee Gees' catalogue to be re-released on [[Reprise Records]] after the group regained the rights to all of their recordings in 2006.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Barry Gibb|Barry]], [[Robin

on 10 March 1997 in the UK by Polydor, and on 6 May the same year in the US by A&M.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1994, the Bee Gees and [[Polydor Records]] had planned a major tour to promote ''[[Size Isn't Everything]]'' (1993) but it was postponed in February the same year due to [[Barry Gibb]]'s trouble with arthritis in his back, right hand and right knee. Following the cancellation of the tour, [[Robin Gibb]] told the press that the group was working on an album of acoustic versions of songs they had written for other artists. The project was later called ''Love Songs'', which featured some new recordings and was announced as the Bee Gees' new album in September 1994 and planned for release on 14 February (Valentine's Day) of 1995. However, their record company rejected the album.<ref name=\"rejected\">{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/94.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1994 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nAround 1994, the Bee Gees did record six songs, one of which was called \"Miracles Happen\" which was written and recorded to be the title song for a new film version of ''[[Miracle on 34th Street]]''; the Bee Gees got the job in June 1994 and quickly returned this recording, with a boys\u2019 choir and a big string section backing them. The filmmakers however decided later to use only old Christmas songs. On the same session, they also did their own version of their compositions such as \"[[Emotion (Samantha Sang song)|Emotion]]\" ([[Samantha Sang]]), \"[[Heartbreaker (Dionne Warwick song)|Heartbreaker]]\" ([[Dionne Warwick]]), \"Love Never Dies\" and \"Rings Around the Moon\", which were later released as B-sides.<ref name=\"rejected\"/>\n\n==Recording==\nIn July 1995, they started with seven demos for what would become included on the album, along with four demos recorded in the second quarter of 1995. In the October 1995 sessions they recorded their rendition of \"[[Will You Love Me Tomorrow]]\" for a [[Carole King]] tribute album ''[[Tapestry Revisited: A Tribute to Carole King]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/95.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1995 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn March 1996, they relocated to [[The Hit Factory]] in New York to record two songs. Around 1996, the Bee Gees used session musicians to complete the entire album, produced by [[Russ Titelman]]. Also in 1996, the Bee Gees recorded two songs with two members of [[P.M. Dawn]], Attrel Cordes and Jarett Cordes. The producer on \"With My Eyes Closed\" was [[Raphael Saadiq]]. \"[[Still Waters (Run Deep)]]\" was produced by [[Hugh Padgham]]. The last song recorded for the album was \"Closer than Close\" which features [[Maurice Gibb]]'s lead vocals produced by the brothers themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/96.html |title=Gibb Songs: 1996 |last=Brennan |first=Joseph |accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n{{Album reviews\n| rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r261428|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n| rev2score = {{Rating|2.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-06-06/entertainment/9706060042_1_bee-gees-whitney-houston-album-ballads|last=Caro|first=Mark|work=chicagotribune.com|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|title=Review: Bee Gees Still Waters|date=6 June 1997|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev3Score = (C)<ref name=\"EW_review\">{{cite web|last=Schinder|first=Scott|title=''Still Waters'' Review|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,287805,00.html|work=ew.com|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|date=9 May 1997|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''\n| rev4score = {{Rating|2|4}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-10/entertainment/ca-57367_1_bee-gees-show|last=Gardner|first=Elysa|work=articles.latimes.com|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|title=Bee Gees Show Just a Glimmer of Old Magic|date=10 May 1997|accessdate=31 August 2011}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n| rev5Score = {{rating|2|5}}<ref>{{Cite web|last=Moon|first=Tom|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622144804/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thebeegees/albums/album/112063/review/5944463/still_waters|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thebeegees/albums/album/112063/review/5944463/still_waters|archivedate=22 June 2008|date=22 April 1997|accessdate=16 April 2008|title=Music Review: ''Still Waters'' by the Bee Gees}}</ref>\n}}\nThe Bee Gees recorded further new songs in 1996 and 1997, and ''Still Waters'' was released in March 1997. Though receiving lukewarm reviews from critics, the album was their most successful album in almost twenty years; it was released at a time when the Bee Gees were being awarded for lifetime achievements, had recently been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and were regaining high exposure on television, particularly [[VH1]]. The album sold over 5 million copies worldwide,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} peaking at No. 2 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and reaching No. 11 in the United States. The Bee Gees made the album with a variety of top producers, including [[Russ Titelman]], [[David Foster]], [[Hugh Padgham]], and [[Arif Mardin]]. The first single off the album, \"[[Alone (Bee Gees song)|Alone]]\", was a worldwide hit, peaking at No. 5 in the UK and No. 28 in the United States, where it began as a \"hot shot debut\" at No. 34. \"[[I Could Not Love You More]]\" and \"[[Still Waters (Run Deep)]]\" also reached the UK top 20.\n\nIn a special agreement with [[Target Corporation|Target]], Polydor also sold a special edition of the album which included a bonus CD of songs from their ''VH1 Storytellers'' concert. This CD has never been made commercially available outside of the Target agreement.\n\n==Reception==\n\u201cThere is life in the old dog yet! The water is still flowing in the river under the family name of [[Bee Gees]]! The brothers [[Barry Gibb|Barry]], [[Maurice Gibb|Maurice]], and [[Robin Gibb]] did their best once again, for the umpteenth time, or rather to be even said, in their own style, as always,\u201d the album left a very good impression on the stuff of the newspaper \u201c''[[Muzykalnaya Gazeta]]''\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=1997|orig-year=1997|title=\u041e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440 Bee Gees Still Waters|trans-title=Review of Still Waters by Bee Gees|url=http://www.nestor.minsk.by/mg/1997/26/mg72646.html|url-status=live|journal=[[Muzykalnaya Gazeta]]|language=ru|volume=26|pages=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190629104155/http://www.nestor.minsk.by/mg/1997/26/mg72646.html|archive-date=29 June 2019|via=|access-date=30 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn 2003 [[Robin Gibb]] re-recorded the track \"My Lover's Prayer\" as a duet with [[Alistair Griffin]]. This reached No. 5 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] as a double A-side single with Griffin's solo recording of \"[[Bring It On (Alistair Griffin song)|Bring It On]]\". It also appears on Griffin's debut album ''[[Bring It On (Alistair Griffin album)|Bring It On]]'', which reached No. 12 on the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe album became one of the first of the Bee Gees' catalogue to be re-released on [[Reprise Records]] after the group regained the rights to all of their recordings in 2006.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Barry Gibb|Barry]], [[Robin

Cities and counties have the authority to enact additional local sales and use taxes if they are passed by the voters in their area. These local taxes have a ceiling or cap; they cannot exceed $25 for each 1% of tax assessed. These additional taxes are collected by the state, which distributes the money back to the local jurisdictions monthly. Low-income taxpayers with a total annual household income of less than $12,000 are permitted a sales [[tax exemption]] for electricity usage.\n\nSales of alcoholic beverages account for added taxes. A 10% supplemental mixed drink tax is imposed on the sale of alcoholic beverages (excluding beer) at restaurants. A 4% tax is due on the sale of all [[mixed drink]]s (except beer and wine) sold for \"on-premises\" consumption. A 3% tax is due on beer sold for off-premises consumption.\n\n[[Property tax]]es are assessed on real and personal property; only 20% of the value is used as the tax base.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|United States}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.arkansasedc.com/ Arkansas Economic Development Commission]\n*[https://asbtdc.org/ Arkansas Small Business and Technology Development Center]\n\n{{Arkansas}}\n{{Economy of the United States by jurisdiction}}\n\n[[Category:Economy of Arkansas| ]]\n", "name_user": "99.35.202.255", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Arkansas"}

It is operated by Bangkok Mass Transit System PCL (BTSC), a subsidiary of [[BTS Group Holdings]], under a concession granted by the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] (BMA). The system consists of 48 stations along two lines: the [[Sukhumvit Line]] running northwards and south-eastwards, terminating at [[Kasetsart University BTS station|Kasetsart University]] and [[Kheha BTS station|Kheha]] respectively. The [[Silom Line]] which serves Silom and Sathon Roads, the central business district of Bangkok, terminates at [[National Stadium BTS station|National Stadium]] and [[Bang Wa BTS station|Bang Wa]]. The lines interchange at [[Siam BTS station|Siam station]] and have a combined [[Network length (transport)|route length]] of {{convert|53.5|km|mi|sp=us}}. The system is formally known as \"the Elevated Train in Commemoration of HM the King's 6th Cycle Birthday\" ({{lang|th|\u0e23\u0e16\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32\u0e40\u0e09\u0e25\u0e34\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e01\u0e35\u0e22\u0e23\u0e15\u0e34 6 \u0e23\u0e2d\u0e1a \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e23\u0e29\u0e32}}).\n\nBesides the BTS, [[Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan in Bangkok Metropolitan Region|Bangkok's rapid transit system]] includes the underground and elevated [[MRT (Bangkok)|Mass Rapid Transit]] (MRT) railway lines, the [[Bangkok BRT|Bus Rapid Transit System]] (BRT), and the elevated [[Airport Rail Link (Bangkok)|Airport Rail Link]] (ARL), serving several stations in the city before reaching [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bkk masstransit 2020 clear version english wiki-01.png|thumb|Map of Bangkok urban transit systems]]\n[[File:Sky Train Silom Bangkok Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|Skytrain departing [[Sala Daeng BTS station|Sala Daeng station]]]]\n[[File:Bangkok Skytrain interior.JPG|thumb|left|Interior of a train]]\n[[File:Bts-station-bangkok-large.jpg|thumb|A typical BTS station platform, showing platform screen doors]]\nPlans for mass transit in Bangkok began in the early-1980s. An early version of the Skytrain project was known as the [[Lavalin Skytrain]] because it was designed using the [[Vancouver SkyTrain]] as a model, adopting technology developed by [[SNC-Lavalin]]. Due to political interference, the concession with Lavalin was cancelled in June 1992,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=UMlFNn9pcEIC&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=lavalin+skytrain+cancelled+1992&source=bl&ots=yp9XkX1VyY&sig=jOz0QJLg92dEsU9O7qWm-YZc3YI&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=lavalin%20skytrain%20cancelled%201992&f=false|title=Building Social Capital in Thailand: Fibers, Finance and Infrastructure|last=Unger|first=Danny|date=1998-09-28|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521639316|language=en}}</ref> despite Bangkok's chronic [[traffic congestion]]. The [[Government of Thailand|Thai Government]] focused on increasing road and [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]] [[infrastructure]] in an attempt to reduce the congestion. This had little impact as the number of cars on the road continued to increase dramatically. The routes considered as part of the Skytrain project would become the basis for the [[MRT (Bangkok)|MRT system]] and are mainly underground. In the early-1990s, foundations and a viaduct for the Lavalin Skytrain were constructed in the middle of the [[Phra Pok Klao Bridge]] across the [[Chao Phraya River]]. The planned metro bridge remains unused but may become part of the MRT's future [[MRT Purple Line|Purple Line]].\n\nAnother abortive attempt at building an elevated rail network was the [[Bangkok Elevated Road and Train System]] (BERTS), which was terminated in 1998 after only 13.77 percent had been completed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/14/business/worldbusiness/thais-revisit-a-troubled-masstransit-project.html|title=Thais Revisit a Troubled Mass-Transit Project|last=Tribune|first=Thomas Crampton|date=1998-10-14|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref>\n\nShortly after it became clear that the Lavalin Skytrain had stalled, then-[[Governor of Bangkok|Governor]] Major General [[Chamlong Srimuang]] asked his deputy, Captain [[Kritsada Arunwong na Ayutthaya]], to create a new feeder system with a route along [[Sukhumvit Road|Sukhumvit]] and [[Silom Road]]s. Krisda and his team from the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) succeeded in finding a private investor. Krisda also convinced everyone concerned to allow the city supervise the project. [[Keeree Kanjanapas]] founded the Bangkok Transit System Corporation (BTSC) and it successfully financed the system and grew it from a feeder system to a full mass transit project. Thanayong Public Company Limited ({{SET|TYONG}},<ref name=\"TYONG\">{{cite web |url=http://www.btsgroup.co.th/en/about_us_history.php |title=Our History |publisher=BTS Group Holdings Public Company Limited|accessdate=2014-06-26}}</ref> {{lang-th|\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e29\u0e31\u0e17 \u0e18\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22\u0e07 \u0e08\u0e33\u0e01\u0e31\u0e14 (\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e19)}}) had a 28 percent stake in BTSC when the Skytrain began, and therefore in its early days the system was sometimes referred to as the \"Thanayong Skytrain\".\n\n[[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]], the supplier of the railway technology, and the Thai contractor, Italian Thai Development, built the system for BTSC. The \"Skytrain\" name was bestowed later by the press following the Vancouver example where the elevated metro had been named \"Skytrain\". Originally, the Skytrain depot was to be built underneath [[Lumphini Park]], but due to widespread objections from Bangkok residents it was constructed on a parcel of land on [[Phahonyothin Road]], replacing the old northern/northeastern bus terminal ([[Mo Chit Bus Terminal|Mo Chit]]). The current depot at Mo Chit is part of the proposed \"Bangkok Terminal\" project, where a large complex composed of a new regional bus terminal, [[park and ride]] facility, and other commercial development can be built directly above it.\n\nThe Skytrain system was opened on 5 December 1999<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/06/world/bangkok-opens-skytrain-but-will-it-ease-car-traffic.html|title=Bangkok Opens Skytrain, but Will It Ease Car Traffic?|last=Mydans|first=Seth|date=1999-12-06|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref> by Princess [[Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]]. It initially had lower-than-predicted ridership, with 200,000 passenger trips per day. Ticket revenue was only enough to meet the trains' operating cost, and not sufficient to service construction loans.  The Skytrain's daily passenger numbers have steadily increased since then. On 9 December 2005, more than 500,000 single trips were made on the Skytrain on a single day for the first time. By September 2012, the Skytrain served around 600,000 passengers on an average day, increasing to 650,000 on an average weekday in 2013.

Construction began on 13 December 2005 with completion originally expected within two years. However, problems with the tendering and installation of a new Bombardier open signalling system repeatedly pushed back the schedule. The extension finally opening on 15 May 2009. However, the single platform [[Saphan Taksin BTS station|Saphan Taksin station]] which has only one track, has caused repeated delays during rush hour. In 2012, the BMA announced plans to demolish Saphan Taksin station in the future. There are now plans to construct new platforms and remove the bottleneck and keep the station which provides an important link between river boats. The plan includes redesigning the road bridges either side of the viaduct to fit the new station.\n\n===2nd extension - Sukhumvit Line, east===\nA second extension, the 5.25&nbsp;km On Nut station (E09) to Bearing station (E14) started construction in August 2006.<ref>Groundbreaking starts on new BTS extension, ''Daily News'', 15 August 2006</ref> The 4 billion baht extension was again funded by the BMA.<ref>BTS extension budget cut, ''Bangkok Post'', 15 December 2006</ref> The original scheduled opening date was mid-2009.

Subsequently, the extension did not open until over two years later on 12 August 2011. The delay in opening prompted the BMA to offer free travel for this extension until the end of 2011 as compensation. A flat fare is charged for this section. The fee for this extension is separate from the distance based fare of the rest of the BTS network.\n\n===3rd extension - Silom Line, south===\nThe third extension to the network, a 5.3&nbsp;km, four station extension from Wongwian Yai (S8) to Bang Wa (S12) in Phasi Charoen District began construction in the 2nd quarter of 2011 with a deadline of the end of 2012. Only the stations had to be constructed as the viaduct had been completed some years prior. However, construction was delayed for many months by the Bangkok floods of late 2011. It eventually opened in stages.

Little by little, while escalators were installed and side bridges added, patronage increased. The opening of [[Siam Paragon]] Mall in 2004, at the time Thailand's most luxurious mall, boosted crowds at the system's central Siam station. The redevelopment of the [[Ratchaprasong]] and [[Siam]] districts as well as new \"skywalks\" fostered growing accessibility.\n\nRidership grew steadily with incremental expansion of the lines, and at peak hour, the trains sometimes depart without being able to take all waiting passengers. Average daily ridership first surpassed 200,000 in June 2001, 300,000 in November 2003, 400,000 in March 2006, 500,000 in August 2011, 600,000 in August 2013 and 700,000 in November 2017.<ref name=\"ridership-dec2018\" />\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 10em;\"\n|-\n| {{Graph:BTS Skytrain ridership}}\n|-\n| class=\"thumbcaption\" | Average daily ridership on the BTS Skytrain 2006\u20132018.<ref name=\"ridership-dec2018\" />\n|}\n\n===Ridership statistics ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year<ref name=\"ridership-dec2018\" />\n\n!Total ridership\n!Average daily ridership\n|-\n|1999\n|4,585,743\n|169,842\n|-\n|2000\n|55,092,671\n|150,469\n|-\n|2001\n|74,025,652\n|202,685\n|-\n|2002\n|93,493,981\n|256,033\n|-\n|2003\n|102,348,697\n|280,379\n|-\n|2004\n|115,681,448\n|316,068\n|-\n|2005\n|127,350,084\n|348,795\n|-\n|2006\n|140,048,849\n|383,635\n|-\n|2007\n|132,070,502\n|361,977\n|-\n|2008\n|136,350,007\n|372,551\n|-\n|2009\n|140,957,969\n|386,145\n|-\n|2010\n|143,102,971\n|392,376\n|-\n|2011\n|167,348,070\n|458,275\n|-\n|2012\n|194,113,068\n|530,422\n|-\n|2013\n|208,764,971\n|571,855\n|-\n|2014\n|219,422,367\n|598,984\n|-\n|2015\n|229,853,593\n|629,218\n|-\n|2016\n|237,047,435\n|647,752\n|-\n|2017\n|241,067,194\n|657,784\n|-\n|2018\n|240,139,471\n|658,123\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\" | Busiest stations<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prachachat.net/prachachat-top-story/news-145681|title=\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e42\u0e1c\u0e17\u0e47\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e1f\u0e4c\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35\u0e1a\u0e35\u0e17\u0e35\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e2a \"\u0e2a\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21-\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e28\u0e01-\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e15\" \u0e17\u0e30\u0e25\u0e38\u0e41\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e04\u0e19|website=|language=Thai|trans-title=Revealed!

It is operated by Bangkok Mass Transit System PCL (BTSC), a subsidiary of [[BTS Group Holdings]], under a concession granted by the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Administration]] (BMA). The system consists of 48 stations along two lines: the [[Sukhumvit Line]] running northwards and south-eastwards, terminating at [[Kasetsart University BTS station|Kasetsart University]] and [[Kheha BTS station|Kheha]] respectively. The [[Silom Line]] which serves Silom and Sathon Roads, the central business district of Bangkok, terminates at [[National Stadium BTS station|National Stadium]] and [[Bang Wa BTS station|Bang Wa]]. The lines interchange at [[Siam BTS station|Siam station]] and have a combined [[Network length (transport)|route length]] of {{convert|53.5|km|mi|sp=us}}. The system is formally known as \"the Elevated Train in Commemoration of HM the King's 6th Cycle Birthday\" ({{lang|th|\u0e23\u0e16\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32\u0e40\u0e09\u0e25\u0e34\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e01\u0e35\u0e22\u0e23\u0e15\u0e34 6 \u0e23\u0e2d\u0e1a \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e19\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e23\u0e29\u0e32}}).\n\nBesides the BTS, [[Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan in Bangkok Metropolitan Region|Bangkok's rapid transit system]] includes the underground and elevated [[MRT (Bangkok)|Mass Rapid Transit]] (MRT) railway lines, the [[Bangkok BRT|Bus Rapid Transit System]] (BRT), and the elevated [[Airport Rail Link (Bangkok)|Airport Rail Link]] (ARL), serving several stations in the city before reaching [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bkk masstransit 2020 clear version english wiki-01.png|thumb|Map of Bangkok urban transit systems]]\n[[File:Sky Train Silom Bangkok Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|left|Skytrain departing [[Sala Daeng BTS station|Sala Daeng station]]]]\n[[File:Bangkok Skytrain interior.JPG|thumb|left|Interior of a train]]\n[[File:Bts-station-bangkok-large.jpg|thumb|A typical BTS station platform, showing platform screen doors]]\nPlans for mass transit in Bangkok began in the early-1980s. An early version of the Skytrain project was known as the [[Lavalin Skytrain]] because it was designed using the [[Vancouver SkyTrain]] as a model, adopting technology developed by [[SNC-Lavalin]]. Due to political interference, the concession with Lavalin was cancelled in June 1992,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.th/books?id=UMlFNn9pcEIC&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=lavalin+skytrain+cancelled+1992&source=bl&ots=yp9XkX1VyY&sig=jOz0QJLg92dEsU9O7qWm-YZc3YI&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=lavalin%20skytrain%20cancelled%201992&f=false|title=Building Social Capital in Thailand: Fibers, Finance and Infrastructure|last=Unger|first=Danny|date=1998-09-28|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521639316|language=en}}</ref> despite Bangkok's chronic [[traffic congestion]]. The [[Government of Thailand|Thai Government]] focused on increasing road and [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]] [[infrastructure]] in an attempt to reduce the congestion. This had little impact as the number of cars on the road continued to increase dramatically. The routes considered as part of the Skytrain project would become the basis for the [[MRT (Bangkok)|MRT system]] and are mainly underground. In the early-1990s, foundations and a viaduct for the Lavalin Skytrain were constructed in the middle of the [[Phra Pok Klao Bridge]] across the [[Chao Phraya River]]. The planned metro bridge remains unused but may become part of the MRT's future [[MRT Purple Line|Purple Line]].\n\nAnother abortive attempt at building an elevated rail network was the [[Bangkok Elevated Road and Train System]] (BERTS), which was terminated in 1998 after only 13.77 percent had been completed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/14/business/worldbusiness/thais-revisit-a-troubled-masstransit-project.html|title=Thais Revisit a Troubled Mass-Transit Project|last=Tribune|first=Thomas Crampton|date=1998-10-14|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref>\n\nShortly after it became clear that the Lavalin Skytrain had stalled, then-[[Governor of Bangkok|Governor]] Major General [[Chamlong Srimuang]] asked his deputy, Captain [[Kritsada Arunwong na Ayutthaya]], to create a new feeder system with a route along [[Sukhumvit Road|Sukhumvit]] and [[Silom Road]]s. Krisda and his team from the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) succeeded in finding a private investor. Krisda also convinced everyone concerned to allow the city supervise the project. [[Keeree Kanjanapas]] founded the Bangkok Transit System Corporation (BTSC) and it successfully financed the system and grew it from a feeder system to a full mass transit project.

The \"Skytrain\" name was bestowed later by the press following the Vancouver example where the elevated metro had been named \"Skytrain\". Originally, the Skytrain depot was to be built underneath [[Lumphini Park]], but due to widespread objections from Bangkok residents it was constructed on a parcel of land on [[Phahonyothin Road]], replacing the old northern/northeastern bus terminal ([[Mo Chit Bus Terminal|Mo Chit]]). The current depot at Mo Chit is part of the proposed \"Bangkok Terminal\" project, where a large complex composed of a new regional bus terminal, [[park and ride]] facility, and other commercial development can be built directly above it.\n\nThe Skytrain system was opened on 5 December 1999<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/06/world/bangkok-opens-skytrain-but-will-it-ease-car-traffic.html|title=Bangkok Opens Skytrain, but Will It Ease Car Traffic?|last=Mydans|first=Seth|date=1999-12-06|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref> by Princess [[Maha Chakri Sirindhorn]]. It initially had lower-than-predicted ridership, with 200,000 passenger trips per day. Ticket revenue was only enough to meet the trains' operating cost, and not sufficient to service construction loans.  The Skytrain's daily passenger numbers have steadily increased since then. On 9 December 2005, more than 500,000 single trips were made on the Skytrain on a single day for the first time. By September 2012, the Skytrain served around 600,000 passengers on an average day, increasing to 650,000 on an average weekday in 2013. A record 760,000 passengers traveled on Sunday, 22 December 2013, a day of mass political protest in Bangkok.<ref>'Trains gain as rallies clog roads', ''Bangkok Post'', 26 December 2013</ref> The normal Sunday average is 400,000 passengers.

Construction began on 13 December 2005 with completion originally expected within two years. However, problems with the tendering and installation of a new Bombardier open signalling system repeatedly pushed back the schedule. The extension finally opening on 15 May 2009. However, the single platform [[Saphan Taksin BTS station|Saphan Taksin station]] which has only one track, has caused repeated delays during rush hour. In 2012, the BMA announced plans to demolish Saphan Taksin station in the future. There are now plans to construct new platforms and remove the bottleneck and keep the station which provides an important link between river boats. The plan includes redesigning the road bridges either side of the viaduct to fit the new station.\n\n===2nd extension - Sukhumvit Line, east===\nA second extension, the 5.25&nbsp;km On Nut station (E09) to Bearing station (E14) started construction in August 2006.<ref>Groundbreaking starts on new BTS extension, ''Daily News'', 15 August 2006</ref> The 4 billion baht extension was again funded by the BMA.<ref>BTS extension budget cut, ''Bangkok Post'', 15 December 2006</ref> The original scheduled opening date was mid-2009.

Subsequently, the extension did not open until over two years later on 12 August 2011. The delay in opening prompted the BMA to offer free travel for this extension until the end of 2011 as compensation. A flat fare is charged for this section. The fee for this extension is separate from the distance based fare of the rest of the BTS network.\n\n===3rd extension - Silom Line, south===\nThe third extension to the network, a 5.3&nbsp;km, four station extension from Wongwian Yai (S8) to Bang Wa (S12) in Phasi Charoen District began construction in the 2nd quarter of 2011 with a deadline of the end of 2012. Only the stations had to be constructed as the viaduct had been completed some years prior. However, construction was delayed for many months by the Bangkok floods of late 2011.

However, due to a combination of changes in government, a prolonged environmental study, and problems with locating a suitable train depot, the extension has been continually delayed.\n\nA further 16.5&nbsp;km, nine station extension from Saphan Mai to Lam Lukka was also planned once the extension to Saphan Mai had been completed.

However, this may also be built as a light rail (monorail) line.\n\n===Silom Line, south===\nAfter the opening of S11 & S12 on 5 December 2013, the BMA announced a new proposal to further extended the Silom Line by 7&nbsp;km from [[Bang Wa BTS station|Bang Wa (S12) station]], by six stations to Taling Chan, where it would connect with the [[SRT Light Red Line]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thairath.co.th/content/region/387159|title=\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e1f\u0e23\u0e35 1 \u0e40\u0e14\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19 \u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e23\u0e16\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32 \u0e15\u0e32\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19-\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e49\u0e32|accessdate=25 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIf approved, the proposed time frame would be for completion of design by 2015. Construction would be undertaken from 2016-2018 for a planned 2019 opening. Part of the basis for this further extension by the BMA is that it would provide proximate access to the Southern Bus Terminal. This proposal is currently under preliminary study by the BMA.\n\n===Silom Line, west===\nThe Silom Line is planned to be extended by one or two stations west along Rama 1 from National Stadium (W1) to link with the [[SRT Dark Red Line]] at Yot Se station. However, no time frame for this extension has been announced and this section of the Dark Red Line will not be built until further notice.\n\nOriginally, the plan was to extend the Silom Line west from National Stadium into Chinatown, then north to Democracy Monument where it would then run west to Rattanakosin Island and Sanum Luang, tunnel under the river to the Thonburi side before terminating at Phran Nok. However, this plan was shelved in 2009 and much of this route has been replaced by routing changes to the planned [[MRT Orange Line]].\n{{clear}}\n\nBTS Group Holdings will be bidding to manage more BTS and MRT lines in the future through financing built out of its BTS Rail Mass Transit Growth Infrastructure Fund after it got approval from the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2013.

All operate on {{RailGauge|1435mm|allk=on}}. All trains have four doors on each side per car, an air-conditioning unit, and LCD monitors for public announcement and advertising. Public announcements are spoken by actress Ratklao Amaradit. The power supply for all trains is at 750 V DC from the [[third rail]].\n\n===Siemens train===\n====First order (EMU-A)====\n[[File:Bangkok Skytrain exterior.JPG|250px|thumb|[[Siemens Modular Metro]] train (EMU-A1)]]\nThe rolling stock of BTS Skytrain, in use when the line opened in 1999, consisted of 35 [[Siemens Modular Metro]] trains from [[Siemens Mobility|Siemens]].

Their design was modified to the existing BTS's Siemens Modular Metro. The new trains were delivered late and only began service the Silom Line in December 2010. This was some 18 months after the [[Wong Wian Yai]] and [[Krung Thonburi Station|Krung Thonburi]] stations were opened in May 2009 during which time there was severe overcrowding on the Silom line.\n\nThese trains consist of two-motor cars and two-trailer cars (i.e., four-car trainsets) and feature LCD TVs for public announcements and advertising. An advanced digital voice announcement (DVA) and passenger information systems was installed.\n\n====Second order (EMU-B2)====\nIn September 2011, the BTSC ordered five more four-car trainsets of CNR rolling stock for 1.5 billion baht to prepare for the Silom Line extension to [[Bang Wa BTS Station|Bang Wa]] which was then due to open in December 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/business/telecom/258787/more-4-car-trains-on-bts-shopping-list |title=More 4-car trains on BTS shopping list |work=The Bangkok Post |date=29 September 2011 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> These five new train sets of rolling stock entered service on 29 November 2013 after the first two stations of the Silom Line extension to Bang Wa opened in January and February 2013, respectively.

Passengers Information Display)\n\n==Ridership==\nThe first years of operations saw limited ridership. The line had few direct ramps into malls and lacked escalators. Little by little, while escalators were installed and side bridges added, patronage increased. The opening of [[Siam Paragon]] Mall in 2004, at the time Thailand's most luxurious mall, boosted crowds at the system's central Siam station. The redevelopment of the [[Ratchaprasong]] and [[Siam]] districts as well as new \"skywalks\" fostered growing accessibility.\n\nRidership grew steadily with incremental expansion of the lines, and at peak hour, the trains sometimes depart without being able to take all waiting passengers. Average daily ridership first surpassed 200,000 in June 2001, 300,000 in November 2003, 400,000 in March 2006, 500,000 in August 2011, 600,000 in August 2013 and 700,000 in November 2017.<ref name=\"ridership-dec2018\" />\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 10em;\"\n|-\n| {{Graph:BTS Skytrain ridership}}\n|-\n| class=\"thumbcaption\" | Average daily ridership on the BTS Skytrain 2006\u20132018.<ref name=\"ridership-dec2018\" />\n|}\n\n===Ridership statistics ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year<ref name=\"ridership-dec2018\" />\n\n!Total ridership\n!Average daily ridership\n|-\n|1999\n|4,585,743\n|169,842\n|-\n|2000\n|55,092,671\n|150,469\n|-\n|2001\n|74,025,652\n|202,685\n|-\n|2002\n|93,493,981\n|256,033\n|-\n|2003\n|102,348,697\n|280,379\n|-\n|2004\n|115,681,448\n|316,068\n|-\n|2005\n|127,350,084\n|348,795\n|-\n|2006\n|140,048,849\n|383,635\n|-\n|2007\n|132,070,502\n|361,977\n|-\n|2008\n|136,350,007\n|372,551\n|-\n|2009\n|140,957,969\n|386,145\n|-\n|2010\n|143,102,971\n|392,376\n|-\n|2011\n|167,348,070\n|458,275\n|-\n|2012\n|194,113,068\n|530,422\n|-\n|2013\n|208,764,971\n|571,855\n|-\n|2014\n|219,422,367\n|598,984\n|-\n|2015\n|229,853,593\n|629,218\n|-\n|2016\n|237,047,435\n|647,752\n|-\n|2017\n|241,067,194\n|657,784\n|-\n|2018\n|240,139,471\n|658,123\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\" | Busiest stations<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prachachat.net/prachachat-top-story/news-145681|title=\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e42\u0e1c\u0e17\u0e47\u0e2d\u0e1b\u0e44\u0e1f\u0e1f\u0e4c\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35\u0e1a\u0e35\u0e17\u0e35\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e2a \"\u0e2a\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21-\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e28\u0e01-\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e2d\u0e0a\u0e34\u0e15\" \u0e17\u0e30\u0e25\u0e38\u0e41\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e04\u0e19|website=|language=Thai|trans-title=Revealed!

It was recorded live at [[Harvestworks#Studio_PASS|PASS]] (Public Access Synthesizer Studio), New York City in January 1981, and the Actual Festival at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] (Institute of Contemporary Arts), London in August 1981. The album was released on LP by Rift Records in 1982. [[RecRec Music]] reissued the album on CD in 1994.<ref name=Discogs/>\n\nThe PASS concert featured Frith and Ostertag, while the ICA concert featured Frith, Ostertag and Minton. Tape recordings made by Ostertag in [[Nicaragua]] in 1980 were played in both performances; other recordings from radio and TV shows were also used. The LP release included an insert with transcriptions and song lyrics, in Spanish and English, of the recordings used.<ref name=LinerNotes/>\n\n==Background==\nIn 1980 Ostertag spent time in [[Nicaragua]] recording songs and raising money for [[El Salvador]] guerrillas fighting the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]], who had seized power the year before.<ref name=Grella/>{{sfn|Ostertag|2009|p=178}} He used these tapes, plus additional recordings of radio and TV shows, in both ''Voice of America'' concerts. Ostertag's equipment was a keyboard-less, modular [[Serge synthesizer]], telephone answering machine cassette loops, and cassette players, modified to malfunction unpredictably.<ref name=Grella/>{{sfn|Ostertag|2009|p=179}} None of the musicians knew which tape would play next.<ref name=G\u00fcnther/>\n\nAt the ICA concert, vocalist Minton was recruited from the audience to replace Ostertag's synthesizer, which had been \"destroyed in a technical mishap\".{{sfn|Ostertag|2009|p=179}} Minton sang, Ostertag used his broken cassette players and a contact microphone, and Frith played a \"guitar\" he had made from \"a piece of scrap wood with some guitar strings stretched over a pickup\".{{sfn|Ostertag|2009|p=179}} Ostertag's later referred to the event as \"magical\".{{sfn|Ostertag|2009|p=179}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=AllMusic/>\n| rev2 = ''[[DownBeat]]''\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=Mandel/>\n}}\nA reviewer at ''Music and Sound Output'' described ''Voice of America'' as \"the oddest 'music' I've ever heard\"\u2014it has no traditional melody, harmony or rhythm, but is rather \"composed noise ... the sound of lives lived, and lives lost\".<ref name=MusicSoundOutput/> The reviewer said while it is [[Ambient music|ambient]], \"it sure isn't soothing\" like [[Brian Eno|Eno]]'s ''[[Ambient 1: Music for Airports|Music for Airports]]''.<ref name=MusicSoundOutput/>\n\nHoward Mandel wrote in a review in ''[[DownBeat]]'' that the \"metallic electronics\" on the album paints an alarming picture of events in South America.<ref name=Mandel/> He said in contrast, the [[Super Bowl]] and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' tapes bluntly dismiss North American culture. Mandel concluded that \"[p]rogrammatic, perhaps dogmatic, ''Voice of America'' would seem too obvious for critical comment, were new music lovers more committed to political study than they seem to be.\"<ref name=Mandel/>\n\nIn a review at [[:de:Babyblaue Seiten|Babyblaue Seiten]], Ralf J. G\u00fcnther wrote that to appreciate ''Voice of America'', the listener needs to understand the political climate in the United States and [[Nicaragua]] in the early 1980s.

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District. It was re-branded to its current name upon the opening of Tilikum Crossing bridge in 2015.<ref name=\"PS-Loop\">{{cite web|title=Portland Streetcar Loop Service |url=http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |publisher=[[Portland Streetcar]] |accessdate=September 7, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806004043/http://www.portlandstreetcar.org/node/193 |archivedate=August 6, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Broadway Bridge west end.jpg|thumb|left|The Broadway Bridge in 2009, prior to the installation of streetcar tracks]]\n\nPlans to expand the Portland Streetcar east of the [[Willamette River]] emerged in July 1997, at the same time the [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland City Council]] authorized the construction of the system's [[NS Line|first line]] on the west side, between [[Northwest District, Portland, Oregon|Northwest Portland]] and [[Portland State University|PSU]].

Operated by Portland Streetcar, Inc. and [[TriMet]], it consists of two distinct services: the '''A Loop''', which runs [[clockwise]], and the '''B Loop''', which runs counterclockwise. Each service travels a {{convert|4.4|mi|km|1|adj=on}} loop between [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|downtown Portland]] and the [[Central Eastside, Portland, Oregon|Central Eastside]], crossing the [[Willamette River]] on the [[Broadway Bridge (Portland)|Broadway Bridge]] in the north and [[Tilikum Crossing]] in the south. The line connects Portland's downtown, [[Pearl District, Portland, Oregon|Pearl District]], [[South Waterfront, Portland, Oregon|South Waterfront]], and [[Lloyd District, Portland, Oregon|Lloyd District]]. It serves the city's various landmarks and institutions, including the [[Rose Quarter, Portland, Oregon|Rose Quarter]], the [[Oregon Convention Center]], the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]] (OMSI), [[Oregon Health and Science University]] (OHSU), and [[Portland State University]] (PSU).\n\nPortland city officials first proposed building an eastside streetcar line in 1997, at the same time the city council authorized the construction of the [[NS Line|first streetcar line]] in downtown. After several years of planning, the city council adopted the Eastside Streetcar Alignment Study in 2003. Upon its inaugural service in 2012, the Loop Service was known as the '''Central Loop Line''' ('''CL Line'''). It initially ran from Southwest Market Street in downtown Portland to OMSI via the Pearl District.
