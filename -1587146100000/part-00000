Paton]] and won an award for her research poster at the end of the summer.<ref name=\":2\" /> While presenting her research poster at MIT, the dean from the [[New York University School of Medicine]] urged her to consider applying for graduate school at NYU.<ref name=\":3\" /> Despite these experiences, Marlin was still set on becoming a teacher.<ref name=\":0\" /> Upon graduation, Marlin was honored with the Distinguished Student Leader Award for her service as the President of the student government and then pursued a job back in New York City as an AP Biology Teacher.<ref name=\":0\" /> She quickly realized that she wanted to continue learning and applied for graduate programs, eventually deciding to matriculate into the [[New York University School of Medicine]] Graduate Program in Biology and Physiology.<ref name=\":2\" /> After 5 rotations, Marlin joined the lab of Dr. [[Robert Froemke]], a new principal investigator at the time.<ref name=\":3\" /> Froemke was actually so new that Marlin helped unpack boxes of equipment during her rotation and even bought some of her own lab materials for her rotation experiment.<ref name=\":3\" /> Despite a rocky start, Marlin had a very successful graduate experience.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Parental Behavior and Oxytocin ====\nMarlin's work centered around exploring the role of [[oxytocin]], often known as the \"love hormone\", in maternal behavior.<ref name=\":3\" /> On her way to elucidating the biological underpinnings of maternal behavior, Marlin first explored auditory cortex plasticity during critical periods of brain development.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Froemke|first=Robert C.|last2=Jones|first2=Bianca J.|date=November 2011|title=Development of auditory cortical synaptic receptive

excitatory-inhibitory balance in determining the duration of the critical period plasticity for auditory cortical frequency tuning, since after birth the [[auditory cortex]] is not yet tuned.<ref name=\":4\" /> This work laid the foundation for Marlin to be able to explore how oxytocin shapes [[social cognition]] and modifies neural circuits to enable mothers to retrieve pups when they emit ultrasonic stress calls.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Marlin|first=Bianca J.|last2=Mitre|first2=Mariela|last3=D'amour|first3=James A.|last4=Chao|first4=Moses V.|last5=Froemke|first5=Robert

mothers (or dams) respond to pup calls while virgin females do not, suggesting some sort of plasticity in the auditory cortex takes place to enable mothers to respond to their pups.<ref name=\":5\" /> Marlin hypothesized that this plasticity int h auditory cortex was due to oxytocin since virgins can begin to respond to pup calls when administered oxytocin.<ref name=\":5\" /> In fact, Marlin found that oxytocin receptors were more highly expressed in the left auditory cortex than the right, suggesting a pre-existing neural circuit specialized to process social information.<ref name=\":5\" /> They further found that oxytocin sensitized the auditory neural circuits in the left auditory cortex by disinhibiting auditory cortex neurons and long term change in excitatory-inhibitory balance in the auditory cortex.<ref name=\":5\" /> The increased balance accounted for the stable spike-timing precision that is observed in dams but not virgins allowing mothers, or oxytocin exposed virgins, to reliably respond to pup calls.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMarlin's findings were groundbreaking, not only showing functional [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralization]] of the mammalian brain but also a dedicated neural circuit, dependant on [[oxytocin]], for social behaviors and adaptation.<ref name=\":5\" /> Her discovery was highlighted in various press releases and articles such as National Geographic and Science Magazine, and it got to the top 100 Stories of 2015.<ref>{{Cite

at St. John's University, she pursued a dual degree in biology and adolescent education and was actively involved in student leadership and research.<ref name=\":2\" />\u00a0Her choice to pursue

Institute of Technology]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.storiesofwin.org/profiles/2019/11/13/dr-bianca-jones-marlin|title=Dr. Bianca Jones Marlin|website=Stories of

Paton]] and won an award for her research poster at the end of the summer.<ref name=\":2\" /> While presenting her research poster at MIT, the dean from the [[New York University School of Medicine]] urged her to consider applying for graduate school at NYU.<ref name=\":3\" /> Despite these experiences, Marlin was still set on becoming a teacher.<ref name=\":0\" /> Upon graduation, Marlin was honored with the Distinguished Student Leader Award for her service as the President of the student government and then pursued a job back in New York City as an AP Biology Teacher.<ref name=\":0\" /> She quickly realized that she wanted to continue learning and applied for graduate programs, eventually deciding to matriculate into the [[New York University School of Medicine]] Graduate Program in Biology and Physiology.<ref name=\":2\" /> After 5 rotations, Marlin joined the lab of Dr. [[Robert Froemke]], a new principal investigator at the time.<ref name=\":3\" /> Froemke was actually so new that Marlin helped unpack boxes of equipment during her rotation and even bought some of her own lab materials for her rotation experiment.<ref name=\":3\" /> Despite a rocky start, Marlin had a very successful graduate experience.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Parental Behavior and Oxytocin ====\nMarlin's work centered around exploring the role of [[oxytocin]], often known as the \"love hormone\", in maternal behavior.<ref name=\":3\" /> On her way to elucidating the biological underpinnings of maternal behavior, Marlin first explored auditory cortex plasticity during critical periods of brain development.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Froemke|first=Robert C.|last2=Jones|first2=Bianca J.|date=November 2011|title=Development of auditory cortical synaptic receptive

excitatory-inhibitory balance in determining the duration of the critical period plasticity for auditory cortical frequency tuning, since after birth the [[auditory cortex]] is not yet tuned.<ref name=\":4\" /> This work laid the foundation for Marlin to be able to explore how oxytocin shapes [[social cognition]] and modifies neural circuits to enable mothers to retrieve pups when they emit ultrasonic stress calls.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Marlin|first=Bianca J.|last2=Mitre|first2=Mariela|last3=D'amour|first3=James A.|last4=Chao|first4=Moses V.|last5=Froemke|first5=Robert

mothers (or dams) respond to pup calls while virgin females do not, suggesting some sort of plasticity in the auditory cortex takes place to enable mothers to respond to their pups.<ref name=\":5\" /> Marlin hypothesized that this plasticity int h auditory cortex was due to oxytocin since virgins can begin to respond to pup calls when administered oxytocin.<ref name=\":5\" /> In fact, Marlin found that oxytocin receptors were more highly expressed in the left auditory cortex than the right, suggesting a pre-existing neural circuit specialized to process social information.<ref name=\":5\" /> They further found that oxytocin sensitized the auditory neural circuits in the left auditory cortex by disinhibiting auditory cortex neurons and long term change in excitatory-inhibitory balance in the auditory cortex.<ref name=\":5\" /> The increased balance accounted for the stable spike-timing precision that is observed in dams but not virgins allowing mothers, or oxytocin exposed virgins, to reliably respond to pup calls.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMarlin's findings were groundbreaking, not only showing functional [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralization]] of the mammalian brain but also a dedicated neural circuit, dependant on [[oxytocin]], for social behaviors and adaptation.<ref name=\":5\" /> Her discovery was highlighted in various press releases and articles such as National Geographic and Science Magazine, and it got to the top 100 Stories of 2015.<ref>{{Cite

The sine of an acute angle is defined in the context of a [[right triangle]]: for the specified angle, it is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite that angle to the length of the longest side of the triangle (the [[hypotenuse]]).\n\nMore generally, the definition of sine (and other trigonometric functions) can be extended to any [[real number|real]] value in terms of the length of a certain line segment in a [[unit circle]]. More modern definitions express the sine as an [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] or as the solution of certain [[differential equation]]s, allowing their extension to arbitrary positive and negative values and even to [[complex number]]s.\n\nThe sine function is commonly used to model [[periodic function|periodic]] phenomena such as [[sound]] and light waves, the position and velocity of harmonic oscillators, sunlight intensity and day length, and average temperature variations throughout the year.\n\nThe function sine can be traced to the [[Jy\u0101, koti-jy\u0101 and utkrama-jy\u0101|''jy\u0101'' and ''ko\u1e6di-jy\u0101 '']] functions used in [[Gupta period]] [[Indian astronomy]] (''[[Aryabhatiya]]'', ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]''), via translation from Sanskrit to Arabic and then from Arabic to Latin.<ref name=\"Boyer, Carl B. 1991 p. 210\">[[Uta Merzbach|Uta C.

The three sides of the triangle are named as follows:\n\n* The ''opposite side'' is the side opposite to the angle of interest, in this case side&nbsp;''a''.\n* The ''hypotenuse'' is the side opposite the right angle, in this case side&nbsp;''h''. The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right-angled triangle.\n* The ''adjacent side'' is the remaining side, in this case side&nbsp;''b''.  It forms a side of (is adjacent to) both the angle of interest (angle ''A'') and the right angle.\n\nOnce such a triangle is chosen, the sine of the angle is equal to the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse, or:\n\n:<math>\\sin(\\alpha) = \\frac {\\textrm{opposite}} {\\textrm{hypotenuse}}</math>\n\nThe other trigonometric functions of the angle can be defined similarly; for example, the [[Trigonometric functions#cosine|cosine]] of the angle is the ratio between the adjacent side and the hypotenuse, while the [[Trigonometric functions#tangent|tangent]] gives the ratio between the opposite and adjacent sides.\n\nAs stated, the value <math>\\sin(\\alpha)</math> appears to depend on the choice of right triangle containing an angle of measure ''\u03b1''.  However, this is not the case: all such triangles are [[similarity (geometry)|similar]], and so the ratio is the same for each of them.\n\n== Unit circle definition ==\n[[File:Unit circle.svg|right|thumb|Unit circle: the radius has length 1. The variable ''t'' measures the [[angle]] referred to as ''\u03b8'' in the text.]]\nIn [[trigonometry]], a unit circle is the circle of radius one centered at the origin (0, 0) in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\nLet a line through the origin, making an angle of ''\u03b8'' with the positive half of the ''x''-axis, intersect the unit circle. The ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates of this point of intersection are equal to {{math|cos(''\u03b8'')}} and {{math|sin(''\u03b8'')}}, respectively. The point's distance from the origin is always&nbsp;1.\n\nUnlike the definitions with the right triangle or slope, the angle can be extended to the full set of real arguments by using the [[Unit circle#Trigonometric functions on the unit circle|unit circle]]. This can also be achieved by requiring certain symmetries and that sine be a [[periodic function]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"450px\" heights=\"275px\">\nFile:Circle_cos_sin.gif|Animation showing how the sine function (in red) <math>y = \\sin(\\theta)</math> is graphed from the ''y''-coordinate (red dot) of a point on the [[unit circle]] (in green) at an angle of ''\u03b8''.\n</gallery>\n\n== Identities ==\n{{Main|List of trigonometric identities}}\n\nExact identities (using [[radian]]s):\n\nThese apply for all values of <math>\\theta</math>.\n\n: <math>\n\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\csc(\\theta)}\n</math>\n\n=== Reciprocal ===\nThe [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of sine is cosecant, i.e., the reciprocal of {{math|sin(''A'')}} is {{math|csc(''A'')}}, or cosec(''A'').

As sine is non-[[injective]], it is not an exact inverse function but a partial inverse function. For example, {{math|sin(0) {{=}} 0}}, but also {{math|sin({{pi}}) {{=}} 0}}, {{math|sin(2{{pi}}) {{=}} 0}} etc. It follows that the arcsine function is multivalued: {{math|arcsin(0) {{=}} 0}}, but also {{math|arcsin(0) {{=}} {{pi}}}}, {{math|arcsin(0) {{=}} 2{{pi}}}}, etc. When only one value is desired, the function may be restricted to its [[principal branch]].

In computing, it is typically abbreviated to <code>sin</code>.\n\nSome CPU architectures have a built-in instruction for sine, including the Intel x87 FPUs since the 80387.\n\nIn programming languages, <code>sin</code> is typically either a built-in function or found within the language's standard math library.\n\nFor example, the [[C standard library]] defines sine functions within [[C mathematical functions|math.h]]: <code>sin([[Double-precision floating-point format|double]])</code>, <code>sinf([[Single-precision floating-point format|float]])</code>, and <code>sinl([[long double]])</code>. The parameter of each is a [[floating point]] value, specifying the angle in radians. Each function returns the same [[data type]] as it accepts. Many other trigonometric functions are also defined in [[C mathematical functions|math.h]], such as for cosine, arc sine, and hyperbolic sine (sinh).\n\nSimilarly, [[Python (programming language)|Python]] defines <code>math.sin(x)</code> within the built-in <code>math</code> module. Complex sine functions are also available within the <code>cmath</code> module, e.g. <code>cmath.sin(z)</code>. [[CPython]]'s math functions call the [[C (programming language)|C]] <code>math</code> library, and use a [[double-precision floating-point format]].\n\nThere is no standard algorithm for calculating sine. [[IEEE 754-2008]], the most widely used standard for floating-point computation, does not address calculating trigonometric functions such as sine.<ref>Grand Challenges of Informatics, Paul Zimmermann.

This can lead to different results for different algorithms, especially for special circumstances such as very large inputs, e.g. <code>sin(10{{sup|22}})</code>.\n\nA once common programming optimization, used especially in 3D graphics, was to pre-calculate a table of sine values, for example one value per degree. This allowed results to be looked up from a table rather than being calculated in real time. With modern CPU architectures this method may offer no advantage. {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} <!-- Looking up in a table essentially involves copying a number from one memory location to another. How can calculating a sine be as quick as that? A: depends on many things, but mainly if the value in memory is not in cache, then the cache-miss can be relatively expensive, whereas a trig function never needs to touch main memory (or alternative, it can be expensive for the rest of the code to have the CPU cache filled with trig tables, causing cache-misses elsewhere). Probably needs a more definitive answer. Have changed 'typically' to 'may' for now. -->\n\nThe [[CORDIC]] algorithm is commonly used in scientific calculators.\n\n=== Turns based implementations ===\n\nSome software libraries provide implementations of sine using the input angle in half-[[Turn (angle)|turns]], a half-turn being an angle of 180 degrees or <math>\\pi</math> radians.

In contrast, representing <math>2\\pi</math>, <math>\\pi</math>, and <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> in binary floating-point or binary scaled fixed-point always involves a loss of accuracy. \n\nTurns also have an accuracy advantage and efficiency advantage for computing modulo to one period. Computing modulo 1 turn or modulo 2 half-turns can be losslessly and efficiently computed in both floating-point and fixed-point. For example, computing modulo 1 or modulo 2 for a binary point scaled fixed-point value requires only a bit shift or bitwise AND operation. In contrast, computing modulo <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> involves inaccuracies in representing <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math>.\n\nFor applications involving angle sensors, the sensor typically provides angle measurements in a form directly compatible with turns or half-turns. For example, an angle sensor may count from 0 to 4096 over one complete revolution.<ref>\"[https://www.allegromicro.com/en/Products/Magnetic-Linear-And-Angular-Position-Sensor-ICs/Angular-Position-Sensor-ICs/AAS33051.aspx ALLEGRO Angle Sensor Datasheet]</ref> If half-turns are used as the unit for angle, then the value provided by the sensor directly and losslessly maps to a fixed-point data type with 11 bits to the right of the binary point. In contrast, if radians are used as the unit for storing the angle, then the inaccuracies and cost of multiplying the raw sensor integer by an approximation to <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2048}</math> would be incurred.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[\u0100ryabha\u1e6da's sine table]]\n* [[Bhaskara I's sine approximation formula]]\n* [[Discrete sine transform]]\n* [[Euler's formula]]\n* [[Generalized trigonometry]]\n* [[Hyperbolic function]]\n* [[Law of sines]]\n* [[List of periodic functions]]\n* [[List of trigonometric identities]]\n* [[Madhava series]]\n* [[Madhava's sine table]]\n* [[Optical sine theorem]]\n* [[Polar sine]]\u2014a generalization to vertex angles\n* [[Proofs of trigonometric identities]]\n* [[Sinc function]]\n* [[Sine and cosine transforms]]\n* [[Sine integral]]\n* [[Sine quadrant]]\n* [[Sine wave]]\n* [[Sine\u2013Gordon equation]]\n* [[Sinusoidal model]]\n* [[Trigonometric functions]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation | first1 = John C. | last1 = Traupman, Ph.D. | year = 1966 | title = The New College Latin & English Dictionary | publisher = Bantam | location = Toronto | isbn = 0-553-27619-0 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/boysgirlsbookabo00gard_0 }}\n* {{citation | title = Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary | location = Springfield | publisher =G. & C.

The sine of an acute angle is defined in the context of a [[right triangle]]: for the specified angle, it is the ratio of the length of the side that is opposite that angle to the length of the longest side of the triangle (the [[hypotenuse]]).\n\nMore generally, the definition of sine (and other trigonometric functions) can be extended to any [[real number|real]] value in terms of the length of a certain line segment in a [[unit circle]]. More modern definitions express the sine as an [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]] or as the solution of certain [[differential equation]]s, allowing their extension to arbitrary positive and negative values and even to [[complex number]]s.\n\nThe sine function is commonly used to model [[periodic function|periodic]] phenomena such as [[sound]] and light waves, the position and velocity of harmonic oscillators, sunlight intensity and day length, and average temperature variations throughout the year.\n\nThe function sine can be traced to the [[Jy\u0101, koti-jy\u0101 and utkrama-jy\u0101|''jy\u0101'' and ''ko\u1e6di-jy\u0101 '']] functions used in [[Gupta period]] [[Indian astronomy]] (''[[Aryabhatiya]]'', ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]''), via translation from Sanskrit to Arabic and then from Arabic to Latin.<ref name=\"Boyer, Carl B. 1991 p. 210\">[[Uta Merzbach|Uta C.

The three sides of the triangle are named as follows:\n\n* The ''opposite side'' is the side opposite to the angle of interest, in this case side&nbsp;''a''.\n* The ''hypotenuse'' is the side opposite the right angle, in this case side&nbsp;''h''. The hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right-angled triangle.\n* The ''adjacent side'' is the remaining side, in this case side&nbsp;''b''.  It forms a side of (is adjacent to) both the angle of interest (angle ''A'') and the right angle.\n\nOnce such a triangle is chosen, the sine of the angle is equal to the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse, or:\n\n:<math>\\sin(\\alpha) = \\frac {\\textrm{opposite}} {\\textrm{hypotenuse}}</math>\n\nThe other trigonometric functions of the angle can be defined similarly; for example, the [[Trigonometric functions#cosine|cosine]] of the angle is the ratio between the adjacent side and the hypotenuse, while the [[Trigonometric functions#tangent|tangent]] gives the ratio between the opposite and adjacent sides.\n\nAs stated, the value <math>\\sin(\\alpha)</math> appears to depend on the choice of right triangle containing an angle of measure ''\u03b1''.  However, this is not the case: all such triangles are [[similarity (geometry)|similar]], and so the ratio is the same for each of them.\n\n== Unit circle definition ==\n[[File:Unit circle.svg|right|thumb|Unit circle: the radius has length 1. The variable ''t'' measures the [[angle]] referred to as ''\u03b8'' in the text.]]\nIn [[trigonometry]], a unit circle is the circle of radius one centered at the origin (0, 0) in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\nLet a line through the origin, making an angle of ''\u03b8'' with the positive half of the ''x''-axis, intersect the unit circle. The ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates of this point of intersection are equal to {{math|cos(''\u03b8'')}} and {{math|sin(''\u03b8'')}}, respectively. The point's distance from the origin is always&nbsp;1.\n\nUnlike the definitions with the right triangle or slope, the angle can be extended to the full set of real arguments by using the [[Unit circle#Trigonometric functions on the unit circle|unit circle]]. This can also be achieved by requiring certain symmetries and that sine be a [[periodic function]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"450px\" heights=\"275px\">\nFile:Circle_cos_sin.gif|Animation showing how the sine function (in red) <math>y = \\sin(\\theta)</math> is graphed from the ''y''-coordinate (red dot) of a point on the [[unit circle]] (in green) at an angle of ''\u03b8''.\n</gallery>\n\n== Identities ==\n{{Main|List of trigonometric identities}}\n\nExact identities (using [[radian]]s):\n\nThese apply for all values of <math>\\theta</math>.\n\n: <math>\n\\sin(\\theta) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\theta \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\csc(\\theta)}\n</math>\n\n=== Reciprocal ===\nThe [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of sine is cosecant, i.e., the reciprocal of {{math|sin(''A'')}} is {{math|csc(''A'')}}, or cosec(''A'').

For example, {{math|sin(0) {{=}} 0}}, but also {{math|sin({{pi}}) {{=}} 0}}, {{math|sin(2{{pi}}) {{=}} 0}} etc. It follows that the arcsine function is multivalued: {{math|arcsin(0) {{=}} 0}}, but also {{math|arcsin(0) {{=}} {{pi}}}}, {{math|arcsin(0) {{=}} 2{{pi}}}}, etc. When only one value is desired, the function may be restricted to its [[principal branch]].

In computing, it is typically abbreviated to <code>sin</code>.\n\nSome CPU architectures have a built-in instruction for sine, including the Intel x87 FPUs since the 80387.\n\nIn programming languages, <code>sin</code> is typically either a built-in function or found within the language's standard math library.\n\nFor example, the [[C standard library]] defines sine functions within [[C mathematical functions|math.h]]: <code>sin([[Double-precision floating-point format|double]])</code>, <code>sinf([[Single-precision floating-point format|float]])</code>, and <code>sinl([[long double]])</code>. The parameter of each is a [[floating point]] value, specifying the angle in radians. Each function returns the same [[data type]] as it accepts. Many other trigonometric functions are also defined in [[C mathematical functions|math.h]], such as for cosine, arc sine, and hyperbolic sine (sinh).\n\nSimilarly, [[Python (programming language)|Python]] defines <code>math.sin(x)</code> within the built-in <code>math</code> module. Complex sine functions are also available within the <code>cmath</code> module, e.g. <code>cmath.sin(z)</code>. [[CPython]]'s math functions call the [[C (programming language)|C]] <code>math</code> library, and use a [[double-precision floating-point format]].\n\nThere is no standard algorithm for calculating sine. [[IEEE 754-2008]], the most widely used standard for floating-point computation, does not address calculating trigonometric functions such as sine.<ref>Grand Challenges of Informatics, Paul Zimmermann. September 20, 2006 \u2013 p. 14/31 {{cite web |url=http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~bjorner/ae-is-budapest/talks/Sept20pm2_Zimmermann.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-11 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716205108/http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~bjorner/ae-is-budapest/talks/Sept20pm2_Zimmermann.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}</ref> Algorithms for calculating sine may be balanced for such constraints as speed, accuracy, portability, or range of input values accepted. This can lead to different results for different algorithms, especially for special circumstances such as very large inputs, e.g. <code>sin(10{{sup|22}})</code>.\n\nA once common programming optimization, used especially in 3D graphics, was to pre-calculate a table of sine values, for example one value per degree. This allowed results to be looked up from a table rather than being calculated in real time. With modern CPU architectures this method may offer no advantage. {{citation needed|date=October 2012}} <!-- Looking up in a table essentially involves copying a number from one memory location to another. How can calculating a sine be as quick as that? A: depends on many things, but mainly if the value in memory is not in cache, then the cache-miss can be relatively expensive, whereas a trig function never needs to touch main memory (or alternative, it can be expensive for the rest of the code to have the CPU cache filled with trig tables, causing cache-misses elsewhere). Probably needs a more definitive answer. Have changed 'typically' to 'may' for now. -->\n\nThe [[CORDIC]] algorithm is commonly used in scientific calculators.\n\n=== Turns based implementations ===\n\nSome software libraries provide implementations of sine using the input angle in half-[[Turn (angle)|turns]], a half-turn being an angle of 180 degrees or <math>\\pi</math> radians. Representing angles in turns or half-turns has accuracy advantages and efficiency advantages in some cases.\n<ref>\"[https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/double.sinpi.html MATLAB Documentation sinpi]</ref>\n<ref>\"[https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.5.3/topics/Trig R Documentation sinpi]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

In contrast, representing <math>2\\pi</math>, <math>\\pi</math>, and <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> in binary floating-point or binary scaled fixed-point always involves a loss of accuracy. \n\nTurns also have an accuracy advantage and efficiency advantage for computing modulo to one period. Computing modulo 1 turn or modulo 2 half-turns can be losslessly and efficiently computed in both floating-point and fixed-point. For example, computing modulo 1 or modulo 2 for a binary point scaled fixed-point value requires only a bit shift or bitwise AND operation. In contrast, computing modulo <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math> involves inaccuracies in representing <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2}</math>.\n\nFor applications involving angle sensors, the sensor typically provides angle measurements in a form directly compatible with turns or half-turns. For example, an angle sensor may count from 0 to 4096 over one complete revolution.<ref>\"[https://www.allegromicro.com/en/Products/Magnetic-Linear-And-Angular-Position-Sensor-ICs/Angular-Position-Sensor-ICs/AAS33051.aspx ALLEGRO Angle Sensor Datasheet]</ref> If half-turns are used as the unit for angle, then the value provided by the sensor directly and losslessly maps to a fixed-point data type with 11 bits to the right of the binary point.

At the time, 70% of residential land was zoned for detached single-family homes. ''The New York Times'' explains that the United States, as a whole, is suffering from an acute shortage of affordable places to live, particularly in urban areas where economic opportunity is concentrated, leading to rising [[homelessness]] rates and housing prices. Studies have found that single-family neighborhoods exacerbates the problem of the rising cost of housing by limiting the supply of available units.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html|title=Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=2019-06-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-15|last2=Bui|first2=Quoctrung|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Many Minneapolis blocks today date to before the 1920s, with duplexes or small apartment buildings next to single-family homes. For years, those older buildings were considered \"nonconforming\" to the cities' ordinances. Under Minneapolis's new plan, that distinction will end as townhomes, duplexes and apartments will become the preferred norm. Therefore, most improvements of these ideas are not new, but rather retroactively undoing typical notions and policies set in the past. ''Slate Magazine'' explained that single-family home zoning was devised as a legal way to keep black Americans and other minorities from moving into certain neighborhoods, and it still functions as an effective barrier today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/business/2018/12/minneapolis-single-family-zoning-housing-racism.html|title=Minneapolis Just Passed the Most Important Housing Reform in America|last=Grabar|first=Henry|date=2018-12-07|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Thus, zoning was used as an indirect way to enact [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential racial segregation]]. Further, ''Politico Magazine'' explains that single-family-only neighborhoods, which were common of city and [[suburb]]an planning for years, and have been components of the American dream: streets lined with stand-alone houses, green lawns and plenty of room. Minneapolis' new plan would reshape the urban streetscape around walking and mass transit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://politi.co/2Ld7TSN|title=How Minneapolis Freed Itself From the Stranglehold of Single-Family Homes|last=Trickey|first=Erick|website=POLITICO Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Minneapolis's approach has been to upzone every single-family neighborhood at once. In addition to cost, single-family neighborhoods constrain the economic potential of cities by limiting growth and contributes to [[climate change]], by necessitating [[Urban sprawl|sprawl]] and long commutes.

At the time, 70% of residential land was zoned for detached single-family homes. ''The New York Times'' explains that the United States, as a whole, is suffering from an acute shortage of affordable places to live, particularly in urban areas where economic opportunity is concentrated, leading to rising [[homelessness]] rates and housing prices. Studies have found that single-family neighborhoods exacerbates the problem of the rising cost of housing by limiting the supply of available units.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/18/upshot/cities-across-america-question-single-family-zoning.html|title=Cities Start to Question an American Ideal: A House With a Yard on Every Lot|last=Badger|first=Emily|date=2019-06-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-15|last2=Bui|first2=Quoctrung|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Many Minneapolis blocks today date to before the 1920s, with duplexes or small apartment buildings next to single-family homes. For years, those older buildings were considered \"nonconforming\" to the cities' ordinances. Under Minneapolis's new plan, that distinction will end as townhomes, duplexes and apartments will become the preferred norm. Therefore, most improvements of these ideas are not new, but rather retroactively undoing typical notions and policies set in the past. ''Slate Magazine'' explained that single-family home zoning was devised as a legal way to keep black Americans and other minorities from moving into certain neighborhoods, and it still functions as an effective barrier today.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/business/2018/12/minneapolis-single-family-zoning-housing-racism.html|title=Minneapolis Just Passed the Most Important Housing Reform in America|last=Grabar|first=Henry|date=2018-12-07|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> Thus, zoning was used as an indirect way to enact [[Residential segregation in the United States|residential racial segregation]]. Further, ''Politico Magazine'' explains that single-family-only neighborhoods, which were common of city and [[suburb]]an planning for years, and have been components of the American dream: streets lined with stand-alone houses, green lawns and plenty of room.

Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n==Prime Minister==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire. Major paved the way for the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the 'Belfast Agreement', which was signed after he left office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Good-Friday-Agreement |title=Good Friday Agreement |encyclopedia= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= 15 April 2019}}</ref>\nIn March 1995, Major refused to answer the phone calls of United States President [[Bill Clinton]] for several days because of his anger at Clinton's decision to invite Gerry Adams to the [[White House]] for [[Saint Patrick's Day|St Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1243638,00.html|title='Mandela helped me survive Monicagate, Arafat could not make the leap to peace&nbsp;\u2013 and for days John Major wouldn't take my calls'|work=The Guardian |location=London | date= 21 June 2004 | accessdate=17 September 2006 | first=Alan | last=Rusbridger}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nFrom 1994 to 1997, Major [[privatisation of British Rail|privatised British Rail]], splitting it up into [[Passenger rail franchising in Great Britain|franchises to be run by the private sector]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=12| title=Railways Act 1993| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1903| website=The Railways Archive| publisher=originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office| accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref> The process was controversial at the time, and the [[Impact of the privatisation of British Rail|effect of privatising the railway]] is still disputed, with large growth in passenger numbers and increasing efficiency matched by large public subsidy<ref>{{cite news|title= Have train fares gone up or down since British Rail?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21056703|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=22 January 2013|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/regulation-industry/what-would-we-consider-a-successful-railway-system|title=What would we consider a successful railway system?|last=Southwood|first=Ben|date=19 August 2014|publisher=[[Adam Smith Institute]]|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> and concern about foreign companies running British railways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/revealed-how-the-world-gets-rich-from-privatising-british-public-services-9874048.html|title=Revealed: How the world gets rich \u2013 from privatising British public services|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate= 30 December 2015|date=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===\"Sleaze\"===\nAt the 1993 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Conference, Major began the \"[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]\" campaign, which he intended to also be about a wide variety of issues including the economy, education and policing, but which was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) purely in the context of returning to the moral and [[family values]] that they associated with the Conservative Party.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=403\u201308}}\n\nInstead of being well received, \"Back to Basics\" instead became synonymous with scandal, often exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail by [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.

He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n==Final years in Parliament==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]]. His [[1997 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]] were announced in August 1997.\n\nMajor remained active in Parliament after his resignation, regularly attending and contributing in debates. He stood down from the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], having announced his retirement live on [[BBC One]]'s breakfast television show with [[David Frost]] in October 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast_with_frost/962625.stm |title=Interview on ''Breakfast With Frost'' |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 October 2000 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Sir John Major - geograph.org.uk - 1367859.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Major by [[Shenda Amery]] in Huntingdon Library]]\nMajor's mild-mannered style and moderate political stance contrasted with that of Thatcher, and made him theoretically well-placed to act as a conciliatory and relatively uncontroversial leader of his party. In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters. Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion led by [[Bill Cash]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier. A series of scandals among leading Conservative MPs also did Major and his government no favours. His task became even more difficult after the well-received election of [[Tony Blair]] as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]] in July 1994.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM? | date=16 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMajor defended his government in his memoirs, focusing particularly on how under him the British economy had recovered from the recession of 1990\u20131992. He wrote that, \"During my premiership interest rates fell from 14% to 6%; unemployment was at 1.75&nbsp;million when I took office, and at 1.6&nbsp;million and falling upon my departure; and the government's annual borrowing rose from [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]0.5&nbsp;billion to nearly \u00a346&nbsp;billion at its peak before falling to \u00a31&nbsp;billion\".{{sfn|Major|2000|p=689}} [[Kenneth Clarke|Ken Clarke]] stated in 2016 that Major's reputation looked better as time went by, in the same way that [[Tony Blair]]'s legacy appeared to be in decline.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rice|first1=Michael|title=In Depth BBC Interview: Ken Clarke|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox24s3NylMI&t=1808s|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe former Labour MP [[Tony Banks, Baron Stratford|Tony Banks]] said of Major in 1994 that, \"He was a fairly competent Chairman of Housing on Lambeth Council.

Major's appearance was noted in its greyness, his prodigious [[philtrum]], and large glasses, all of which were exaggerated in caricatures. For example, in ''[[Spitting Image]]'', Major's puppet was changed from a circus performer to that of a grey man who ate dinner with his wife in silence, occasionally saying \"nice peas, dear\", while at the same time nursing an unrequited crush on his colleague [[Virginia Bottomley]] \u2013 an invention, but an ironic one in view of his affair with [[Edwina Currie]], which was not then a matter of public knowledge. By the end of his premiership his puppet would often be shown observing the latest fiasco and ineffectually murmuring \"oh dear\".\n\nThe media (particularly ''[[The Guardian]]'' cartoonist [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]]) used the allegation by [[Alastair Campbell]] that he had observed Major tucking his shirt into his underpants to [[caricature]] him wearing his pants outside his trousers,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cartoons/stevebell/0,MFEM,802577,00.html |title=If only we had known back then |work=The Guardian |location=London |author=Steve Bell |authorlink=Steve Bell (cartoonist) |date=1 October 2002 |accessdate=17 September 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223223113/http://www.guardian.co.uk/cartoons/stevebell/0%2CMFEM%2C802577%2C00.html |archivedate=23 February 2006 }}</ref> as a pale grey echo of both [[Superman]] and [[Supermac (cartoon)|Supermac]], a parody of [[Harold Macmillan]].

The magazine still runs one-off specials of this diary (with the age updated) on occasions when Major is in the news, such as on the breaking of the Edwina Currie story or the publication of his autobiography. The magazine also ran a series of cartoons called ''101 Uses for a John Major'' (based on a comic book of some ten years earlier, called ''[[101 Uses for a Dead Cat]]''), in which Major was illustrated serving a number of bizarre purposes, such as a train-spotter's anorak. <!-- Reference at http://catalogue.bl.uk/F/LG58CGKV3EVJCXLYJJH461GPDNH8KSVKIKFX4YQHYNUQ6PT4BD-02109?func=full-set-set&set_number=122950&set_entry=000001&format=999 requires sign-in -->\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton?

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1990 to 1997. Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

He later decided to undertake a correspondence course in banking. Major took up a post as an executive at the [[Standard Chartered |Standard Chartered Bank]] in May 1965 and he rose quickly through the ranks.

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n==Prime Minister==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

The [[Downing Street Declaration]] was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and [[Albert Reynolds]], the Irish [[Taoiseach]], with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire. Major paved the way for the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the 'Belfast Agreement', which was signed after he left office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Good-Friday-Agreement |title=Good Friday Agreement |encyclopedia= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= 15 April 2019}}</ref>\nIn March 1995, Major refused to answer the phone calls of United States President [[Bill Clinton]] for several days because of his anger at Clinton's decision to invite Gerry Adams to the [[White House]] for [[Saint Patrick's Day|St Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1243638,00.html|title='Mandela helped me survive Monicagate, Arafat could not make the leap to peace&nbsp;\u2013 and for days John Major wouldn't take my calls'|work=The Guardian |location=London | date= 21 June 2004 | accessdate=17 September 2006 | first=Alan | last=Rusbridger}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nFrom 1994 to 1997, Major [[privatisation of British Rail|privatised British Rail]], splitting it up into [[Passenger rail franchising in Great Britain|franchises to be run by the private sector]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=12| title=Railways Act 1993| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1903| website=The Railways Archive| publisher=originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office| accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref> The process was controversial at the time, and the [[Impact of the privatisation of British Rail|effect of privatising the railway]] is still disputed, with large growth in passenger numbers and increasing efficiency matched by large public subsidy<ref>{{cite news|title= Have train fares gone up or down since British Rail?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21056703|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=22 January 2013|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/regulation-industry/what-would-we-consider-a-successful-railway-system|title=What would we consider a successful railway system?|last=Southwood|first=Ben|date=19 August 2014|publisher=[[Adam Smith Institute]]|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> and concern about foreign companies running British railways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/revealed-how-the-world-gets-rich-from-privatising-british-public-services-9874048.html|title=Revealed: How the world gets rich \u2013 from privatising British public services|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate= 30 December 2015|date=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===\"Sleaze\"===\nAt the 1993 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Conference, Major began the \"[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]\" campaign, which he intended to also be about a wide variety of issues including the economy, education and policing, but which was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) purely in the context of returning to the moral and [[family values]] that they associated with the Conservative Party.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=403\u201308}}\n\nInstead of being well received, \"Back to Basics\" instead became synonymous with scandal, often exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail by [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n==Final years in Parliament==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]]. His [[1997 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Resignation Honours]] were announced in August 1997.\n\nMajor remained active in Parliament after his resignation, regularly attending and contributing in debates. He stood down from the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], having announced his retirement live on [[BBC One]]'s breakfast television show with [[David Frost]] in October 2000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast_with_frost/962625.stm |title=Interview on ''Breakfast With Frost'' |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 October 2000 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Sir John Major - geograph.org.uk - 1367859.jpg|thumb|upright|Bust of Major by [[Shenda Amery]] in Huntingdon Library]]\nMajor's mild-mannered style and moderate political stance contrasted with that of Thatcher, and made him theoretically well-placed to act as a conciliatory and relatively uncontroversial leader of his party. In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters. Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion led by [[Bill Cash]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier. A series of scandals among leading Conservative MPs also did Major and his government no favours. His task became even more difficult after the well-received election of [[Tony Blair]] as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]] in July 1994.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM? | date=16 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMajor defended his government in his memoirs, focusing particularly on how under him the British economy had recovered from the recession of 1990\u20131992. He wrote that, \"During my premiership interest rates fell from 14% to 6%; unemployment was at 1.75&nbsp;million when I took office, and at 1.6&nbsp;million and falling upon my departure; and the government's annual borrowing rose from [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]0.5&nbsp;billion to nearly \u00a346&nbsp;billion at its peak before falling to \u00a31&nbsp;billion\".{{sfn|Major|2000|p=689}} [[Kenneth Clarke|Ken Clarke]] stated in 2016 that Major's reputation looked better as time went by, in the same way that [[Tony Blair]]'s legacy appeared to be in decline.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rice|first1=Michael|title=In Depth BBC Interview: Ken Clarke|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox24s3NylMI&t=1808s|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe former Labour MP [[Tony Banks, Baron Stratford|Tony Banks]] said of Major in 1994 that, \"He was a fairly competent Chairman of Housing on Lambeth Council.

Less rainfall can be seen in this region, but the summer months give enough to sustain crops.\n\n==Climate==\nTemperatures are generally very high in Yemen, particularly in the coastal regions. Rainfall is limited, with variations based on elevation. The highlands enjoy a temperate, rainy summer with an average high temperature of {{convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1|abbr=on}} and a cool, moderately dry winter with temperatures occasionally dipping below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1|abbr=on}}.

It has a continental shelf of {{convert|200|nmi|mi km|1}} or to the edge of the continental margin.<ref name=cp/>\n\n==Natural resources==\nYemen's principal natural resources are oil and natural gas as well as agriculturally productive land in the west. Other natural resources include fish and seafood, rock salt, marble, and major unexplored  deposits of [[coal]], [[gold]], [[lead]], [[nickel]], and [[copper]].<ref name=cp/>\n\n==Land use==\nOnly 2.91 percent of Yemen is considered to be arable land, and less than 0.6 percent of the land is planted with permanent crops. About {{convert|6801|km2|sqmi}} of the land is irrigated. According to the [[United Nations]], Yemen has {{convert|19550|km2|sqmi}} of forest and other wooded land, which constitutes almost 4 percent of total land area.<ref name=cp/>\n\n==Environmental factors==\nYemen is subject to sandstorms and dust storms, resulting in soil erosion and crop damage. The country has very limited natural freshwater and consequently inadequate supplies of potable water. [[Desertification]] ([[land degradation]] caused by aridity) and [[overgrazing]] are also problems.<ref name=cp/> It is a party to international [[Biodiversity]], Climate Change, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, and [[Ozone Layer Protection]] agreements.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ym.html |title=Yemen |author=<!--Not Stated--> |date=<!--Not Stated--> |website=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] |access-date=23 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Disputed territory==\nA long-standing dispute between Saudi Arabia and Yemen was resolved in June 2000 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Jeddah (2000)|Treaty of Jeddah]]. This agreement provides coordinates for use in delineating the land and maritime border, including the section in the eastern desert region of Yemen that potentially contains significant amounts of oil. Friction between the two countries in recent years over security of the borders appears to have been alleviated by the establishment of joint border patrols.\n\nFollowing years of dispute between Yemen and [[Eritrea]] over ownership of the [[Hanish Islands]] and fishing rights in the Red Sea, in 1999 an international arbitration panel awarded sovereignty of the islands to Yemen. Relations between the two countries remain strained, however, and Yemen continues to protest Eritrean fishing in the disputed territory.<ref name=cp/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mountains in the Arabian Peninsula]]\n** [[Hadhramaut Mountains]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Geography of Asia}}\n{{Asia topic|Climate of}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of Yemen| ]]\n[[Category:Arabian Plate]]\n\n[[bn:\u0987\u09af\u09bc\u09c7\u09ae\u09c7\u09a8#\u09ad\u09c2\u0997\u09cb\u09b2]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox country geography\n| name                 = Yemen\n| image name           = \n| image size           = \n| image caption        = \n| image alt            = \n| map                  = Yemen relief location map.jpg\n| map size             = 250\n| map_alt              = Topographic map of Yemen\n| continent            = [[Asia]]\n| region               = [[Middle East]]\n| coordinates          = {{coord|15|N|48|E|type:country_region:YE|display=inline,title}}\n| area ranking         = 50th\n| km area              = 527,968\n| miles area           = \n| percent land         = \n| percent water        = \n| km coastline         = 1,906\n| miles coastline      = \n|exclusive economic zone= {{convert|552,669|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}| borders              = {{cvt|1,746|km|mi}} <br/>[[Oman]]: {{cvt|288|km|mi}} <br/>[[Saudi Arabia]]: {{cvt|1,458|km|mi}}\n| highest point        = [[Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb]]<br/> {{cvt|3,667|m|ft}}\n| lowest point         = [[Arabian Sea]]<br/> {{cvt|0|m|ft}}\n| longest river        = \n| largest lake         = \n| climate              = \n| terrain              = \n| natural resources    = Oil, Natural Gas, Rock Salt, Marble\n| natural hazards      = \n| environmental issues = \n}}\n\n[[Yemen]] is located in [[Southwest Asia]], at the southern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], between [[Oman]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].

The at sea testing began in 1960 after research and development in the late 1950s. The project's test requirement was to prove detection of a submerged submarine at {{cvt|500|nmi| mi km}}. The experiment, covering a number of years, involved a large active element and a massive receiver array.\n\n[[File:Project Artemis Receiving Array Module.png|150px|thumb|right|Artemis receiving field array module as implemented 1963.]]\nThe receiving array was a field of modules forming a three dimensional array laid from 1961 to 1963 on the slops of a seamount, the Plantagenet Bank ({{coord|31.983333|-65.183333}}), off [[Bermuda]]. The modules, attached to ten lines of cable, were {{cvt|57|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} masts with floats on top to keep them upright. Each module mounted sets of hydrophones. The receiving array terminated at [[Argus Island]], built on the seamount's top, with data processed at the laboratory that was also constructed for the project. The laboratory was then the The [[Naval Facility Bermuda#Tudor Hill Laboratory|Bermuda Research Detachment]] of the [[Naval Undersea Warfare Center|Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory]].\n\nThe active source array was to be suspended at {{cvt|1000|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} to {{cvt|1050|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} from the former tanker {{ship|USNS|Mission Capistrano||2}}. The 1440-element active array had a one megawatt acoustic output (120 dB) with a center frequency of 400 Hz.\n\nThough Artemis failed the final test and resulted in no operational system, it set the agenda for research in ocean acoustics and engineering such systems for the future.\n\n==Background==\nWorld War II experience prompted the U.S. Navy to examine the threat of Soviet submarines which had been improved by captured German technology. As a result of the threat being considered high risk sonic detection became a top priority. The Navy approached the National Science Foundation's Committee for Undersea Warfare for advice.{{sfn|Whitman|2005|}} Following the recommendations the Navy established a study under Massachusetts Institute of Technology auspices designated Project Hartwell which in 1950 recommended development of a long range passive acoustic detection system. By 13 November 1950 a letter contract had been issued to [[Western Electric]] to develop the bottom array system exploiting low frequencies. A test array was laid in the Bahamas off [[Eleuthera]] and upon successful tests with a U.S. submarine an order for six such systems was issued in 1952. The he [[SOSUS|Sound Surveillance System]] (SOSUS), its name and purpose classified, was given the unclassified name Project Caesar to cover its development and maintenance.{{sfn|Whitman|2005|}}{{sfn|IUSS/CAESAR Alumni Association\u2014History|}} In 1956, as the last of the Atalntic SOSUS systems were being installed, [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]] convened a summer study similar to the Hartwell study designated the [[Project Nobska|Nobska Study]] coordinated by the Committee on Undersea Warfare. Admiral Burke was particularly concerned with the threat of Soviet nuclear submarines in light of the capabilities of the nuclear submarine {{ship|USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|2}} had been demonstrated.{{sfn|IUSS/CAESAR Alumni Association\u2014History|}}{{sfn|Weir|2001|pp=274\u2014288}}\n\nMuch of the study focused on undersea warfare and the need for nuclear anti-submarine submarines but also, in looking at SOSUS, recommended research and development of potential long range, active sonar systems. It also focused on the need to understand the ocean environment.{{sfn|Weir|2001|pp=274\u2014288}} A particular area of investigation was whether an active system could be developed with the power and directivity to exploit ocean zones the passive system being installed might not.{{sfn|Weir|2001|p=281}} With respect to the Navy active sonar project designated Artemis, to run from 1958 to 1963, an understanding of the ocean environment was vital. If the project was to succeed the full efforts of every ocean scientist, technician and laboratory on the Atlantic coast was likely required yet there were only six to seven hundred such people that were qualified. The need to meet that requirement and long term antisubmarine needs of the Navy drove large increases in academic and research budgets for oceanography.{{sfn|Weir|2001|pp=337\u2014338}}\n\nAs Project Artemis was undergoing tests in the early 1960s SOSUS tracked the first U.S. ballistic missile submarine {{ship|USS|George Washington|SSBN-598|2}} across the atlantic in 1961. In June 1962 SOSUS made the first detection and classification of a Soviet diesel submarine, and during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October tracked Soviet [[Foxtrot-class submarine]] with correlated sighting by aircraft. On 6 July 1962 the SOSUS array terminating at [[Barbados]] demonstrated detection range by identifying a Soviet nuclear submarine transiting off Norway.{{sfn|IUSS/CAESAR Alumni Association\u2014History|}}\n\n==Project overview==\nA commercial contractor had proposed a long range, active sonar surveillance system to the Navy but a review by Hudson Laboratories showed there were flaws in the basic numbers upon which the proposal looked feasible. Frederick V. (Ted) Hunt of Harvard had proposed that a goal should be a scan of \"an ocean an hour\" that was based on the sound speed in seawater so that 3600 seconds equals 3600 miles so that round trip travel time would allow surveillance of an entire ocean from mid ocean. Though the consensus was that contractor's proposed system would not work as conceived there were possibilities something in the field of active sonar could work to meet Hunt's concept.{{sfn|Frosch|1981|}} [[Artemis]], Greek goddess of the hunt, was given to the project as a name for that relationship, making it unusual in not being a code word or acronym.{{sfn|Shor|1997|p=71}} Project Artemis experimental and system development effort's goal was to define requirements for a long range, low frequency, active, sonar capable of detecting a submerged submarine at about {{cvt|500|nmi| mi km}}.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|pp=59\u201460}} The concept was a possible undersea equivalent of the Arctic Distant Early Warning (DEW) radar system.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p=91}}\n\nArtemis involved nearly the entire national acoustics community at the time.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|pp=3, 59\u201461}} A [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] (BTL)<ref group=note>BTL was the research and development principal for technology used in the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS).

The Artemis system failed the test. Station keeping issues of the active array ship, degradation of the receiving system modules and poorly understood ocean acoustics were involved in the failure.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p=62\u201463}}\n\n[[File:Artemis Collapsed Module-Fig.16--100443.png|150px|thumb|right|Collapsed Module.]]\nNo operational system resulted from the effort but it defined the limitations of technology and understanding of underwater acoustics of the time. In particular understanding of scattering and reverberation was shown to be lacking. The Artemis receiving array was expected to demonstrate problems with multipath reflections but experienced considerable failure with floats upon which its configuration relied. Surveys by the submersible [[DSV Alvin|''Alvin'']] in 1966 and 1967 found multiple float failures with collapsed modules and other damage to standing modules.{{sfn|Mullarkey|Cobb|1966|p=1}}\n\nThe major technological limitation was found to be computing capability, particularly speed, that forced use of analog devices for beam steering and signal processing. Results in acoustics formed the basis for extensive ocean acoustics research going forward after the project's termination in the mid 1960s. The project successfully proved techniques for developing and deploying high powered, phased active hydrophone arrays.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p= 59, 62}}\n\n==Passive receiving array==\n[[File:Artemis Module connection to cable Fig7--00433.png|150px|thumb|right|Module connection to cable.]]\nThe receiving array, just as with the source, underwent significant changes from planning to the final test configuration. It was a three dimensional system of hydrophones laid by cable ships on the slope of the Plantagnet Bank seamount. The array cables terminated at Argus Island, the tower erected for the project on the bank. The tower passed the data to the laboratory built and staffed for the project at Tudor Hill, Bermuda.\n\n===Undersea array===\nThe passive receive array field consisted of ten parallel cables with 210 modules composed of {{cvt|57|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} masts mounting hydrophones. The cables were laid down the slope of Plantagenet Bank<ref group=note>Plantagenet Bank is often referred to as Argus Bank.</ref> in Bermuda. A 1961 array was to the north east of and parallel to array field string number one and a horizontal string, across the slope, was at right angles to the field at about {{cvt|3000|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Mullarkey|Cobb|1966|pp=1\u20143, 15, Figure 1}} The receiving field was approximately on the sound channel axis laid between {{cvt|2000|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|6000|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Mullarkey|Cobb|1966|pp=2, 6\u20147}}{{sfn|Urick|1974|p=12}}<ref group=note>Sources, some recollections, others more specific, vary on depths.

Each cable had special takeouts built into it at intervals from which wires to the hydrophones were connected. Each mast was clamped onto the special cable with takeouts. At the upper end of the approximately {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} cable a wire rope was attached and led to an explosively embedded anchor shot into the flat coral top of Plantagenet Bank. Tension of more than 40,000&nbsp;lb was applied to the wire rope and cable to lay it down the side of the bank in the straightest line possible. At one point all further construction ceased while a stopper was placed on the special cable because most of the connection to the wire rope had broken and the string was being held by a few strands of wire on the double drum winch on ''YFNB-1''2. The ''YFNB-12'' was held in place with four Murray and Tregurtha Diesel outboard engines placed on the corners and capable of 360 degree rotation, developing tremendous thrust in any direction.{{CN|date=April 2020}}<ref group=note>The information is from an anonymous personal recollection moved to [[Talk:Project Artemis]] in 2009.

The Tudor Hill Laboratory continued in operation until 30 September 1990 and was the only Atlantic Navy laboratory with access to an operational SOSUS system for research. The facilities were transferred to the Naval Facility with the understanding that NUSC would be provided support should a research need arise.{{sfn|Merrill|Wyld|1977|pp=274\u2014277}}<ref group=note>Naval Facility Bermuda itself was closed 30 September 1992.</ref> \n\nAfter the project and facilities had been transferred in 1966 with a later transfer of responsibilities to the Naval Research Laboratory in 1969 the Argus Island tower underwent an extensive structural review and repair cost estimates. The acoustic program review also showed the tower at its useful end. As a result the tower was slated for removal. Before demolition the sea cables terminating in the tower were tagged for identification and cut. In May 1976 the tower was toppled by demolitions.{{sfn|Flato|1976|pp=4, 9\u201410}} The tower's demolition removed a major navigation aid for sport fisherman.\n\n==Active source array==\nThe Artemis steering committee elected to produce a one megawatt acoustic output (120 dB) active source.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|pp=61, 91}} On 12 May 1958 the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Advisory Group for High Power, Deep Under- water Sound Source met and issued a report on 17 July that resulted in a general specification by The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) issued on 9 September. Five companies responded with widely varying proposals. One conclusion from review of the proposals was the necessity of having a back up of a second [[transducer]] design.{{sfn|McClinton|1967|pp=1\u20145, 71}} \n\nA fixed bottom site at Eleuthera had been considered with surveys done seeking such a site but the site was changed to Plantagenet Bank which was too far from Bermuda to make power and system cables economical. The deployment, support and operation from a ship then became specified.{{sfn|McClinton|1967|pp=3\u20145}}\n\nThe problems of power, amplification, instrumentation and other support were engineering problems that were relatively easily managed. The transducers for the array itself and its handling systems required pushing the state-of-the-art into entirely new areas of research and development.{{sfn|McClinton|1967|p=5}} Magnetostricthve and electromagnetic transducers were considered for the array itself with low power ceramic transducers to be used for the experimental use in developing the array.{{sfn|McClinton|1967|pp=6\u201414}} On 4 December 1958 [[Bendix Corporation]] was contracted through Hudson Laboratories to develop and produce a magnetostricthve transducer and on 28 August 1959 the first [[Frank Massa|Massa]] transducer was delivered to NRL. Despite redesign the Bendix effort on the magnetorestrictive transducer was unsuccessful, though the last model was retained as backup, and that effort was terminated on 8 June 1960 with replacement by Massa.{{sfn|McClinton|1967|pp=Appendix A}} The final design then settled on a large, 1440-transducer element \"billboard\" array of transducers.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|pp=61, 91}} \n\nIndividual elements passed tests but demonstrated problems when assembled into modules and the array itself due to mutual interference. An element with slightly lower radiation resistance would absorb power from higher power elements and fail to be followed by the next lower power element in a cascading failure that particularly damaged elements away from the array's edges.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|pp=61\u201462}}{{sfn|McClinton|1962|pp=9\u201414}}{{sfn|McClinton|1967|pp=43\u201445}} The Naval Research Laboratory had both a theoretical study and an active experimental program seeking a solution. The experimental study involved modules of the elements in test configurations using the {{ship|USS|Hunting||6}} to help determine the final array configuration. Ultimately transducers were replaced by electromechanical elements termed \"shaker boxes\" to reduce those failures.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|pp=61\u201462, Appendix 9: 3. Alan Berman, p. 2; 8.

The [[T2 tanker]] hull had sufficient space and structural integrity to allow installing array power and control systems and creating a large center well through which the array could be housed, lowered and operated.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p=61}}{{sfn|McClinton|1962|pp=3\u20144}} On 28 August 1958 specifications for conversion were completed with a contract for conversion with [[Avondale Shipyard|Avondale Marine Ways]] let on 7 January 1960. The ship engaged in array tests and was further modified until 3 November 1962 when the array was removed at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and the ship released for other work until re-installation the next March.{{sfn|McClinton|1967|pp=Appendix A}}\n\nThe mutual element interference problems resulted in redesign and re engineering that continued past the Bermuda experimental period to the end of the formal Artemis experiments. For example the array was tested in the [[Great Bahama Canyon|Northwest Providence Channel]], Bahamas, from 19 July through 3 August 1964  after the array elements' connections had been changed to all parallel rather than combined series-parallel connections to reduce the interference problems. The array was tested at frequencies from 350 to 500 cycles per second in steps. The array was then put through an endurance run at 350, 415, 430, and 450 cycles per second for two hours at power levels of 120, 200, 300 and 450 kilowatts. The maximum power could not be attained and element deflections continued to be a problem.{{sfn|Ferris|1965|pp=1\u20143, 8\u201410}} \n\n===Array description for original experiment===\nThe source array was {{convert|54|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|44.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|22.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} thick at bottom.

At the top of the structure were four hydrophones in three coordinate axes that provided array orientation relative to acoustic positioning hydrophones.{{sfn|McClinton|1962|p=6}}\n\nThe array development and tests continued after the main experiment at Bermuda in an effort to resolve issues with high powered active sources.\n\n===Ship modifications===\n[[File:ARTEMIS Equipment Arrangement \u2014 MISSION CAPISTRANO.png|150px|thumb|right|Equipment arrangement on USNS ''Mission Capistrano''.]]\nThe most significant modification was a center well through which the array could be lowered to operating depth, raised, and securely stowed. The well was {{cvt|40|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} wide by {{cvt|60|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long with bottom closure when the array was raised by means of a rolling door on the long axis.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p=61}}{{sfn|McClinton|1962|pp=6\u20148, 25\u201431 (illustrations)}}\n\nThe array as evolved for the main experiment was powered by a gas turbine generating plant aft of the ship's array well capable of producing three phase, 60 cycle current and rated at 8,000 kilowatts at 4160 volts. Controls protected the gas turbine from rapid load variance from 800 kw base to 8,000 full and to keep voltage variation at less than 2% and frequency variation at less than 1%. Forward of the array well was an amplifier room with the controls, switching mechanisms, transformers, instrumentation and electronic amplifiers to drive the transducers in the array.{{sfn|McClinton|1962|pp=3\u20146}}\n\nA 500-shaft horsepower, controllable-pitch screw propeller was installed in a transverse tunnel through the forefoot of the USNS ''Mission Capistrano''. The propeller, commonly called a bow thruster, delivered 11,250 pounds of thrust during dock trials. Its use was for the single purpose of controlling the vessel's heading when lying to in the open ocean. Under these conditions, it is reported capable of swinging the ship to any given bearing and maintaining it to within one degree of yaw in sea conditions of 15 knot winds and five foot waves upon six foot swells.\n\nThat system was not sufficient and the movement of the ship introduced doppler distortions that were unpredictable to the active array. A system of eight large outboard engines and station keeping on a bottom fixed transducer was planned. The project was terminated before the advanced ship station keeping and positioning system was implemented.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p=62}}\n\n==Feasibility of permanent installation==\nA feasibility study for developing the amplifier transducer and energy storage system to be associated with a nuclear-powered, remote, unattended high-power acoustic source was investigated. The results of this study indicated that such a system was feasible but no such system became operational. \n\nThe large masts and unwieldy components combined with the fact that [[SOSUS]] was more than effective in detecting submarines resulted in it remaining an experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last=Weir |first=Gary R. |title=The Navy, Science, and Professional History |publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command |year=2017 |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/needs-opportunities-modern-history-us-navy/navy-science-professional-history.html |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Political context==\nIn 1959 the Soviet Union was deploying its first generation Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, [[R-7 Semyorka]].

Artemis was considered part of an underwater Defense Early Warning system. However, it was discovered that the Soviet boats were particularly noisy. Rapid advances in computer technology and the development of signal processing algorithms, such as the [[Fast Fourier transform]], quickly gave the West the superior military position using multiple passive [[SOSUS]] arrays. In 1961, SOSUS tracked [[USS George Washington (SSBN-598)|USS ''George Washington'']] from the United States to the [[United Kingdom]]. The next year SOSUS detected and tracked the first Soviet Diesel submarine.\n\nThe Artemis active systems were eventually retired, since the passive systems proved adequate to detecting submarines that threatened the American coast. Largely because of the spy ring operated by [[John Anthony Walker]] in 1968, and the development of the submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, the need to send ballistic submarines directly to the American coast diminished. The Soviet Union began to rely more on a [[Bastion (naval)|Bastion]], whereby the latest generation of SSBN was deployed only in well-protected nearby waters. A mobile surveillance capability, called [[SURTASS]], was developed in the mid-1970s. This system passed Operational Evaluation ([[OPEVAL]]) in 1980 and the ships began to be deployed. By 1985 Soviet naval exercises in the North Sea were using as many as a 100 vessels, including attack submarines. Chief of Naval Operations enacted the ''Urgent Anti-Submarine Research Program'' (CUARP), whose centerpiece was to activate the SURTASS fleet with a low-frequency system, and to develop tactics for such a system. The mobile system was considerably smaller than the Artemis transducer array, weighing roughly one-sixth as much.\n\nWith the diminished threat of the Atlantic SSBN, vessels were equipped with [[Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System]] and deployed in the Pacific. New generations of [[Attack submarine]]s and [[Ballistic missile submarine]]s were being deployed by several countries. The low frequency active system is currently being deployed on the [[USNS Impeccable (T-AGOS-23)|USNS ''Impeccable'']].\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References cited==\n*{{cite report |last=Erskine |first=Fred T.

The at sea testing began in 1960 after research and development in the late 1950s. The project's test requirement was to prove detection of a submerged submarine at {{cvt|500|nmi| mi km}}. The experiment, covering a number of years, involved a large active element and a massive receiver array.\n\n[[File:Project Artemis Receiving Array Module.png|150px|thumb|right|Artemis receiving field array module as implemented 1963.]]\nThe receiving array was a field of modules forming a three dimensional array laid from 1961 to 1963 on the slops of a seamount, the Plantagenet Bank ({{coord|31.983333|-65.183333}}), off [[Bermuda]]. The modules, attached to ten lines of cable, were {{cvt|57|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} masts with floats on top to keep them upright. Each module mounted sets of hydrophones. The receiving array terminated at [[Argus Island]], built on the seamount's top, with data processed at the laboratory that was also constructed for the project. The laboratory was then the The [[Naval Facility Bermuda#Tudor Hill Laboratory|Bermuda Research Detachment]] of the [[Naval Undersea Warfare Center|Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory]].\n\nThe active source array was to be suspended at {{cvt|1000|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} to {{cvt|1050|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} from the former tanker {{ship|USNS|Mission Capistrano||2}}. The 1440-element active array had a one megawatt acoustic output (120 dB) with a center frequency of 400 Hz.\n\nThough Artemis failed the final test and resulted in no operational system, it set the agenda for research in ocean acoustics and engineering such systems for the future.\n\n==Background==\nWorld War II experience prompted the U.S. Navy to examine the threat of Soviet submarines which had been improved by captured German technology. As a result of the threat being considered high risk sonic detection became a top priority. The Navy approached the National Science Foundation's Committee for Undersea Warfare for advice.{{sfn|Whitman|2005|}} Following the recommendations the Navy established a study under Massachusetts Institute of Technology auspices designated Project Hartwell which in 1950 recommended development of a long range passive acoustic detection system. By 13 November 1950 a letter contract had been issued to [[Western Electric]] to develop the bottom array system exploiting low frequencies. A test array was laid in the Bahamas off [[Eleuthera]] and upon successful tests with a U.S. submarine an order for six such systems was issued in 1952. The he [[SOSUS|Sound Surveillance System]] (SOSUS), its name and purpose classified, was given the unclassified name Project Caesar to cover its development and maintenance.{{sfn|Whitman|2005|}}{{sfn|IUSS/CAESAR Alumni Association\u2014History|}} In 1956, as the last of the Atalntic SOSUS systems were being installed, [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]] convened a summer study similar to the Hartwell study designated the [[Project Nobska|Nobska Study]] coordinated by the Committee on Undersea Warfare. Admiral Burke was particularly concerned with the threat of Soviet nuclear submarines in light of the capabilities of the nuclear submarine {{ship|USS|Nautilus|SSN-571|2}} had been demonstrated.{{sfn|IUSS/CAESAR Alumni Association\u2014History|}}{{sfn|Weir|2001|pp=274\u2014288}}\n\nMuch of the study focused on undersea warfare and the need for nuclear anti-submarine submarines but also, in looking at SOSUS, recommended research and development of potential long range, active sonar systems. It also focused on the need to understand the ocean environment.{{sfn|Weir|2001|pp=274\u2014288}} A particular area of investigation was whether an active system could be developed with the power and directivity to exploit ocean zones the passive system being installed might not.{{sfn|Weir|2001|p=281}} With respect to the Navy active sonar project designated Artemis, to run from 1958 to 1963, an understanding of the ocean environment was vital. If the project was to succeed the full efforts of every ocean scientist, technician and laboratory on the Atlantic coast was likely required yet there were only six to seven hundred such people that were qualified. The need to meet that requirement and long term antisubmarine needs of the Navy drove large increases in academic and research budgets for oceanography.{{sfn|Weir|2001|pp=337\u2014338}}\n\nAs Project Artemis was undergoing tests in the early 1960s SOSUS tracked the first U.S. ballistic missile submarine {{ship|USS|George Washington|SSBN-598|2}} across the atlantic in 1961. In June 1962 SOSUS made the first detection and classification of a Soviet diesel submarine, and during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October tracked Soviet [[Foxtrot-class submarine]] with correlated sighting by aircraft. On 6 July 1962 the SOSUS array terminating at [[Barbados]] demonstrated detection range by identifying a Soviet nuclear submarine transiting off Norway.{{sfn|IUSS/CAESAR Alumni Association\u2014History|}}\n\n==Project overview==\nA commercial contractor had proposed a long range, active sonar surveillance system to the Navy but a review by Hudson Laboratories showed there were flaws in the basic numbers upon which the proposal looked feasible. Frederick V. (Ted) Hunt of Harvard had proposed that a goal should be a scan of \"an ocean an hour\" that was based on the sound speed in seawater so that 3600 seconds equals 3600 miles so that round trip travel time would allow surveillance of an entire ocean from mid ocean. Though the consensus was that contractor's proposed system would not work as conceived there were possibilities something in the field of active sonar could work to meet Hunt's concept.{{sfn|Frosch|1981|}} [[Artemis]], Greek goddess of the hunt, was given to the project as a name for that relationship, making it unusual in not being a code word or acronym.{{sfn|Shor|1997|p=71}} Project Artemis experimental and system development effort's goal was to define requirements for a long range, low frequency, active, sonar capable of detecting a submerged submarine at about {{cvt|500|nmi| mi km}}.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|pp=59\u201460}} The concept was a possible undersea equivalent of the Arctic Distant Early Warning (DEW) radar system.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p=91}}\n\nArtemis involved nearly the entire national acoustics community at the time.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|pp=3, 59\u201461}} A [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] (BTL)<ref group=note>BTL was the research and development principal for technology used in the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS).

The Artemis system failed the test. Station keeping issues of the active array ship, degradation of the receiving system modules and poorly understood ocean acoustics were involved in the failure.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p=62\u201463}}\n\n[[File:Artemis Collapsed Module-Fig.16--100443.png|150px|thumb|right|Collapsed Module.]]\nNo operational system resulted from the effort but it defined the limitations of technology and understanding of underwater acoustics of the time. In particular understanding of scattering and reverberation was shown to be lacking. The Artemis receiving array was expected to demonstrate problems with multipath reflections but experienced considerable failure with floats upon which its configuration relied. Surveys by the submersible [[DSV Alvin|''Alvin'']] in 1966 and 1967 found multiple float failures with collapsed modules and other damage to standing modules.{{sfn|Mullarkey|Cobb|1966|p=1}}\n\nThe major technological limitation was found to be computing capability, particularly speed, that forced use of analog devices for beam steering and signal processing. Results in acoustics formed the basis for extensive ocean acoustics research going forward after the project's termination in the mid 1960s. The project successfully proved techniques for developing and deploying high powered, phased active hydrophone arrays.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p= 59, 62}}\n\n==Passive receiving array==\n[[File:Artemis Module connection to cable Fig7--00433.png|150px|thumb|right|Module connection to cable.]]\nThe receiving array, just as with the source, underwent significant changes from planning to the final test configuration. It was a three dimensional system of hydrophones laid by cable ships on the slope of the Plantagnet Bank seamount. The array cables terminated at Argus Island, the tower erected for the project on the bank. The tower passed the data to the laboratory built and staffed for the project at Tudor Hill, Bermuda.\n\n===Undersea array===\nThe passive receive array field consisted of ten parallel cables with 210 modules composed of {{cvt|57|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} masts mounting hydrophones. The cables were laid down the slope of Plantagenet Bank<ref group=note>Plantagenet Bank is often referred to as Argus Bank.</ref> in Bermuda. A 1961 array was to the north east of and parallel to array field string number one and a horizontal string, across the slope, was at right angles to the field at about {{cvt|3000|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Mullarkey|Cobb|1966|pp=1\u20143, 15, Figure 1}} The receiving field was approximately on the sound channel axis laid between {{cvt|2000|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|6000|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Mullarkey|Cobb|1966|pp=2, 6\u20147}}{{sfn|Urick|1974|p=12}}<ref group=note>Sources, some recollections, others more specific, vary on depths.

Each cable had special takeouts built into it at intervals from which wires to the hydrophones were connected. Each mast was clamped onto the special cable with takeouts. At the upper end of the approximately {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} cable a wire rope was attached and led to an explosively embedded anchor shot into the flat coral top of Plantagenet Bank. Tension of more than 40,000&nbsp;lb was applied to the wire rope and cable to lay it down the side of the bank in the straightest line possible. At one point all further construction ceased while a stopper was placed on the special cable because most of the connection to the wire rope had broken and the string was being held by a few strands of wire on the double drum winch on ''YFNB-1''2. The ''YFNB-12'' was held in place with four Murray and Tregurtha Diesel outboard engines placed on the corners and capable of 360 degree rotation, developing tremendous thrust in any direction.{{CN|date=April 2020}}<ref group=note>The information is from an anonymous personal recollection moved to [[Talk:Project Artemis]] in 2009.

The Tudor Hill Laboratory continued in operation until 30 September 1990 and was the only Atlantic Navy laboratory with access to an operational SOSUS system for research. The facilities were transferred to the Naval Facility with the understanding that NUSC would be provided support should a research need arise.{{sfn|Merrill|Wyld|1977|pp=274\u2014277}}<ref group=note>Naval Facility Bermuda itself was closed 30 September 1992.</ref> \n\nAfter the project and facilities had been transferred in 1966 with a later transfer of responsibilities to the Naval Research Laboratory in 1969 the Argus Island tower underwent an extensive structural review and repair cost estimates. The acoustic program review also showed the tower at its useful end. As a result the tower was slated for removal. Before demolition the sea cables terminating in the tower were tagged for identification and cut. In May 1976 the tower was toppled by demolitions.{{sfn|Flato|1976|pp=4, 9\u201410}} The tower's demolition removed a major navigation aid for sport fisherman.\n\n==Active source array==\nThe Artemis steering committee elected to produce a one megawatt acoustic output (120 dB) active source.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|pp=61, 91}} On 12 May 1958 the Office of Naval Research (ONR) Advisory Group for High Power, Deep Under- water Sound Source met and issued a report on 17 July that resulted in a general specification by The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) issued on 9 September. Five companies responded with widely varying proposals. One conclusion from review of the proposals was the necessity of having a back up of a second [[transducer]] design.{{sfn|McClinton|1967|pp=1\u20145, 71}} \n\nA fixed bottom site at Eleuthera had been considered with surveys done seeking such a site but the site was changed to Plantagenet Bank which was too far from Bermuda to make power and system cables economical. The deployment, support and operation from a ship then became specified.{{sfn|McClinton|1967|pp=3\u20145}}\n\nThe problems of power, amplification, instrumentation and other support were engineering problems that were relatively easily managed. The transducers for the array itself and its handling systems required pushing the state-of-the-art into entirely new areas of research and development.{{sfn|McClinton|1967|p=5}} Magnetostricthve and electromagnetic transducers were considered for the array itself with low power ceramic transducers to be used for the experimental use in developing the array.{{sfn|McClinton|1967|pp=6\u201414}} On 4 December 1958 [[Bendix Corporation]] was contracted through Hudson Laboratories to develop and produce a magnetostricthve transducer and on 28 August 1959 the first [[Frank Massa|Massa]] transducer was delivered to NRL. Despite redesign the Bendix effort on the magnetorestrictive transducer was unsuccessful, though the last model was retained as backup, and that effort was terminated on 8 June 1960 with replacement by Massa.{{sfn|McClinton|1967|pp=Appendix A}} The final design then settled on a large, 1440-transducer element \"billboard\" array of transducers.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|pp=61, 91}} \n\nIndividual elements passed tests but demonstrated problems when assembled into modules and the array itself due to mutual interference. An element with slightly lower radiation resistance would absorb power from higher power elements and fail to be followed by the next lower power element in a cascading failure that particularly damaged elements away from the array's edges.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|pp=61\u201462}}{{sfn|McClinton|1962|pp=9\u201414}}{{sfn|McClinton|1967|pp=43\u201445}} The Naval Research Laboratory had both a theoretical study and an active experimental program seeking a solution. The experimental study involved modules of the elements in test configurations using the {{ship|USS|Hunting||6}} to help determine the final array configuration. Ultimately transducers were replaced by electromechanical elements termed \"shaker boxes\" to reduce those failures.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|pp=61\u201462, Appendix 9: 3. Alan Berman, p. 2; 8. Robert Chrisp, p. 2}}{{sfn|McClinton|1962|pp=10\u201412}} The array could not attain full power due to nonuniform displacement across the face of array at higher power.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p=91}}{{sfn|McClinton|1962|pp=10\u201416}} The problem of inter element coupling and cascading failure was never fully solved.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|pp=61\u201462}}\n\n[[File:AG-162 Mission Capistrano under conversion shoeing ARTEMIS array well.png|150px|thumb|right|USNS ''Mission Capistrano'' undergoing conversion showing Project ARTEMIS active source array well.]]\nThe World War II tanker ''Mission Capistrano'' was selected and modified for deploying the array. The [[T2 tanker]] hull had sufficient space and structural integrity to allow installing array power and control systems and creating a large center well through which the array could be housed, lowered and operated.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p=61}}{{sfn|McClinton|1962|pp=3\u20144}} On 28 August 1958 specifications for conversion were completed with a contract for conversion with [[Avondale Shipyard|Avondale Marine Ways]] let on 7 January 1960. The ship engaged in array tests and was further modified until 3 November 1962 when the array was removed at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and the ship released for other work until re-installation the next March.{{sfn|McClinton|1967|pp=Appendix A}}\n\nThe mutual element interference problems resulted in redesign and re engineering that continued past the Bermuda experimental period to the end of the formal Artemis experiments. For example the array was tested in the [[Great Bahama Canyon|Northwest Providence Channel]], Bahamas, from 19 July through 3 August 1964  after the array elements' connections had been changed to all parallel rather than combined series-parallel connections to reduce the interference problems. The array was tested at frequencies from 350 to 500 cycles per second in steps. The array was then put through an endurance run at 350, 415, 430, and 450 cycles per second for two hours at power levels of 120, 200, 300 and 450 kilowatts. The maximum power could not be attained and element deflections continued to be a problem.{{sfn|Ferris|1965|pp=1\u20143, 8\u201410}} \n\n===Array description for original experiment===\nThe source array was {{convert|54|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|44.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, and {{convert|22.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} thick at bottom. Combined with a support structure for the array itself the source assembly was {{convert|75.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} high with a weight of {{convert|690000|lb|kg}}.{{sfn|McClinton|1962|p=5}} The face of the array was tilted upward at eleven degrees so as to insonify the desired ocean layers from the {{convert|1200|ft|m|abbr=on}} operation depth finally selected.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p=61}}{{sfn|McClinton|1962|p=5}} The transducer elements were cubes of {{convert|1|ft|m|abbr=on}} weighing {{convert|160|lb|kg}} assembled in 72 element modules six elements wide by twelve elements high. Those modules were then assembled on the array in five module components stacked in four horizontal rows.{{sfn|McClinton|1962|p=5}} The optimal center frequency of 400 Hz proved in tests to be optimized with the actual modules at approximately 385 Hz and 405 Hz.{{sfn|McClinton|1962|p=12}}\n\nThe array assembly also had electrical equipment required to make the electrical connection between array transducers and the transmission cable and for measurement and control functions that were housed in tanks at the bottom of the array assembly. At the top of the structure were four hydrophones in three coordinate axes that provided array orientation relative to acoustic positioning hydrophones.{{sfn|McClinton|1962|p=6}}\n\nThe array development and tests continued after the main experiment at Bermuda in an effort to resolve issues with high powered active sources.\n\n===Ship modifications===\n[[File:ARTEMIS Equipment Arrangement \u2014 MISSION CAPISTRANO.png|150px|thumb|right|Equipment arrangement on USNS ''Mission Capistrano''.]]\nThe most significant modification was a center well through which the array could could be lowered to operating depth, raised, and securely stowed. The well was {{cvt|40|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} wide by {{cvt|60|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} long with bottom closure when the array was raised by means of a rolling door on the long axis.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p=61}}{{sfn|McClinton|1962|pp=6\u20148, 25\u201431 (illustrations)}}\n\nThe array as evolved for the main experiment was powered by a gas turbine generating plant aft of the ship's array well capable of producing three phase, 60 cycle current and rated at 8,000 kilowatts at 4160 volts. Controls protected the gas turbine from rapid load variance from 800 kw base to 8,000 full and to keep voltage variation at less than 2% and frequency variation at less than 1%. Forward of the array well was an amplifier room with the controls, switching mechanisms, transformers, instrumentation and electronic amplifiers to drive the transducers in the array.{{sfn|McClinton|1962|pp=3\u20146}}\n\nA 500-shaft horsepower, controllable-pitch screw propeller was installed in a transverse tunnel through the forefoot of the USNS ''Mission Capistrano''. The propeller, commonly called a bow thruster, delivered 11,250 pounds of thrust during dock trials. Its use was for the single purpose of controlling the vessel's heading when lying to in the open ocean. Under these conditions, it is reported capable of swinging the ship to any given bearing and maintaining it to within one degree of yaw in sea conditions of 15 knot winds and five foot waves upon six foot swells.\n\nThat system was not sufficient and the movement of the ship introduced doppler distortions that were unpredictable to the active array. A system of eight large outboard engines and station keeping on a bottom fixed transducer was planned. The project was terminated before the advanced ship station keeping and positioning system was implemented.{{sfn|Erskine|2013|p=62}}\n\n==Feasibility of permanent installation==\nA feasibility study for developing the amplifier transducer and energy storage system to be associated with a nuclear-powered, remote, unattended high-power acoustic source was investigated. The results of this study indicated that such a system was feasible but no such system became operational. \n\nThe large masts and unwieldy components combined with the fact that [[SOSUS]] was more than effective in detecting submarines resulted in it remaining an experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last=Weir |first=Gary R. |title=The Navy, Science, and Professional History |publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command |year=2017 |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/n/needs-opportunities-modern-history-us-navy/navy-science-professional-history.html |accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Political context==\nIn 1959 the Soviet Union was deploying its first generation Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, [[R-7 Semyorka]]. They were capable of delivering its payload at around 8,800&nbsp;km, with an accuracy (CEP) of around 5&nbsp;km. A single nuclear warhead was carried with a nominal yield of 3 megatons of TNT. However, they were very new and turned out to be very unreliable.\n\n[[Image:1st-SOUSE-sensors.png|thumb|right|First SOSUS sensors]][[Soviet submarine K-19|''K-19'']], the first nuclear-powered Russian boat, was commissioned on 30 April 1961. The military at that time considered the single greatest security threat to the USA the possibility of a submarine-delivered nuclear warhead placed near a major American city. Artemis was considered part of an underwater Defense Early Warning system. However, it was discovered that the Soviet boats were particularly noisy. Rapid advances in computer technology and the development of signal processing algorithms, such as the [[Fast Fourier transform]], quickly gave the West the superior military position using multiple passive [[SOSUS]] arrays. In 1961, SOSUS tracked [[USS George Washington (SSBN-598)|USS ''George Washington'']] from the United States to the [[United Kingdom]]. The next year SOSUS detected and tracked the first Soviet Diesel submarine.\n\nThe Artemis active systems were eventually retired, since the passive systems proved adequate to detecting submarines that threatened the American coast. Largely because of the spy ring operated by [[John Anthony Walker]] in 1968, and the development of the submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missiles, the need to send ballistic submarines directly to the American coast diminished. The Soviet Union began to rely more on a [[Bastion (naval)|Bastion]], whereby the latest generation of SSBN was deployed only in well-protected nearby waters. A mobile surveillance capability, called [[SURTASS]], was developed in the mid-1970s. This system passed Operational Evaluation ([[OPEVAL]]) in 1980 and the ships began to be deployed. By 1985 Soviet naval exercises in the North Sea were using as many as a 100 vessels, including attack submarines. Chief of Naval Operations enacted the ''Urgent Anti-Submarine Research Program'' (CUARP), whose centerpiece was to activate the SURTASS fleet with a low-frequency system, and to develop tactics for such a system. The mobile system was considerably smaller than the Artemis transducer array, weighing roughly one-sixth as much.\n\nWith the diminished threat of the Atlantic SSBN, vessels were equipped with [[Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System]] and deployed in the Pacific. New generations of [[Attack submarine]]s and [[Ballistic missile submarine]]s were being deployed by several countries. The low frequency active system is currently being deployed on the [[USNS Impeccable (T-AGOS-23)|USNS ''Impeccable'']].\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References cited==\n*{{cite report |last=Erskine |first=Fred T.
