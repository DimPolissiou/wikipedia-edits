Television producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and foundation executive [[Lloyd Morrisett]] developed the idea to form an organization to produce ''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television series which would help children, especially those from low-income families, prepare for school. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new series. Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was termed \"one of the most important television developments of the decade\".<ref name=\"davis125126\" />\n\n''Sesame Street'' premiered as a series on [[National Educational Television]] (NET) in the United States on November 10, 1969, and moved to NET's successor, the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]), in late 1970. The Workshop was formally incorporated in 1970. [[Gerald S. Lesser]] and [[Edward L. Palmer]] were hired to perform research for the series; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later termed the \"CTW model\". They also hired a staff of producers and writers. After the initial success of ''Sesame Street'', they began to plan for its continued survival, which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other television series. The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985.\n\nAfter ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the ''Sesame Street'' [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppets]] accounted for $15\u201317 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney resigned as CEO in 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement.\n\nOn June 5, 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop<ref>http://www.sesameworkshop.org/about-us/leadership-team/joan-ganz-cooney/</ref> to better represent its activities beyond television, and [[Gary Knell]] became CEO. [[H. Melvin Ming]] replaced Knell in 2011. In 2014, Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn.\n\nIn the main lobby of Sesame Workshop, the Sesame Street Muppets in interactive frames featured [[Elmo (Sesame Street)|Elmo]], [[Big Bird]], [[Cookie Monster]], [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]], [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]], [[Cookie Monster]], [[The Bear family|Baby Bear]], [[Count von Count]], [[Murray Monster|Murray]], [[Rosita (Sesame Street)|Rosita]], [[Abby Cadabby]], [[Grover]], Zoe, Telly, [[Oscar the Grouch]] and others.\n\nAt the main lobby, the characters from [[Sesame Street]] wear pajamas in interactive frames as [[Rosita (Sesame Street)|Rosita]] (her purple doll), Telly (his doll Freddy), [[Elmo (Sesame Street)|Elmo]] (Baby David), [[Abby Cadabby]] (Stuffed Frog Prince), Zoe (Mimi), [[Big Bird]] (Radar), [[Bert and Ernie]] (Rubber Duckie), [[Cookie Monster]] and [[Grover]] are singing a lullaby to [[Big Bird]] and go to sleep.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nDuring the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hellman | first = Peter | title = Street Smart: How Big Bird & Company Do It | journal = New York Magazine | volume = 20 | issue = 46 | page = 52 | date = 23 November 1987 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KOUCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48&vq=sesame+street&q=sesame%20street | issn = 0028-7369 | accessdate = 18 November 2019}}</ref> Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned better grades and learned more effectively.

Eventually, the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget.<ref>Davis, pp. 218\u2013219</ref>  By 2019, the U.S. government donated about four percent of the Workshop's budget, or less than $5 million a year.<ref name=\"guthrie2\"/>\n\n[[File:Jim Henson (1989).jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=A tall, thin man in his early fifties, with salty-gray hair and a full beard, and wearing a tuxedo.|[[Jim Henson]], creator of [[the Muppets]], in 1989]]\n\nFor the first time, a public broadcasting series had the potential to earn a great deal of money.  Immediately after its premiere, ''Sesame Street ''gained attention from marketers,<ref name=\"davis-203\" /> so the Workshop explored sources such as licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales, and became, as Cooney envisioned, a \"multiple media institution\".<ref name=\"cherow-197\">Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 197</ref> Licensing became the foundation of, as writer Louise Gikow stated, the Sesame Workshop endowment,<ref name=\"gikow-268\">Gikow, p. 268</ref> which had the potential to fund the organization and future productions and projects.<ref name=\"davis-205\" /> Muppet creator [[Jim Henson]] owned the trademarks to the [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppet characters]]: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control of all products and product decisions throughout its history; any product line associated with the series had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during broadcastings of ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Davis, pp. 203\u2013205</ref> As Davis reported, \"Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution\" in their marketing and licensing efforts.<ref>Davis, p. 204</ref> In the early 1970s, the CTW negotiated with the company [[Random House]] to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division. Random House and the CTW named [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]] to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the series' curriculum.<ref name=\"davis-205\">Davis, p. 205</ref>  By 2019, the Sesame Workshop had over 500 licensing agreements, and its total revenue in 2018 was $35 million.  A million children play with ''Sesame Street''-themed toys per day.<ref name=\"wallace\"/><ref name=\"guthrie\"/>\n\nSoon after the premiere of ''Sesame Street'', producers, educators, and officials of other nations began requesting that a version of the series be broadcast in their countries. [[CBS]] executive [[Michael Dann]] was required to quit his job at that network due to a change of corporate policy preceding the so-called \"[[rural purge]]\"; upon his ouster, he became vice-president of the CTW and Cooney's assistant.{{refn|group=note|Dann called the creation of the CTW \"one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of the mass media\".<ref>Lesser, p. 36</ref>}} Dann then began developing foreign versions of ''Sesame Street''<ref name=\"cole-147\"/> by arranging what were eventually termed [[International co-productions of Sesame Street|co-productions]], or independent programs with their own sets, characters, and curriculum goals. By 2009, ''Sesame Street'' had expanded into 140 countries;<ref>Gikow, p. 11</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in 2005 that income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million.<ref>Carvajal, Doreen (12 December 2005).

The Workshop decided that all materials its licensing program created would \"underscore and amplify\"<ref name=\"davis-205\" /> the series' curriculum. Coloring books, for example, were prohibited because the Workshop felt they would restrict children's imaginations.<ref name=\"gikow-268\" /> The CTW published ''Sesame Street Magazine'' in 1970, which incorporated the show's curriculum goals in a magazine format.<ref>Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 198</ref> As with the series, research was performed for the magazine, initially by CTW's research department for a year and a half, and then by the Magazine Research Group in 1975.<ref name=\"cherow-197\" />\n\nWorking with [[Random House]] editor Jason Epstein, the CTW hired Christopher Cerf to manage ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s book publishing program.<ref name=\"gikow-268\" /><ref name=\"davis-205\" /> During the division's first year, Cerf earned $900,000 for the CTW. He quit to become more involved with writing and composing music for the series,<ref>Davis, p. 206</ref> and was replaced eventually by Bill Whaley. Ann Kearns, vice president of licensing for the CTW in 2000, stated that Whaley was responsible for expanding the licensing to other products, and for creating a licensing model used by other children's series.<ref name=\"gikow-268\" /> As of 2019, the Workshop had published over 6,500 book titles.<ref name=\"guthrie\"/> and as researcher Renee Cherow-O'Leary stated in 2001, \"the print materials produced by CTW have been an enduring part of the legacy of Sesame Street\".<ref name=\"cherow-197\" /> In one of these books, for example, the death of the ''Sesame Street'' character [[Mr. Hooper]] was featured in a book entitled ''I'll Miss You, Mr. Hooper'', published soon after the series featured it in 1983.<ref>Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 210</ref>  In 2019, ''Parade Magazine'' reported that 20 million copies of ''[[The Monster at the End of This Book: Starring Lovable, Furry Old Grover|The Monster at the End of the Book]]'' and ''Another Monster at the End of this Book'' had been sold, making them the top two best-selling e-books sold.<ref name=\"wallace\"/>  Its [[YouTube]] channel had almost 5 million subscribers.<ref name=\"guthrie\"/>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Sesame Street}}\n\nAccording to director Jon Stone, the music of ''Sesame Street'' was unlike any other children's program on television.<ref>Gikow, p. 220</ref> For the first time, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and was related to its curriculum.<ref>Gikow, p. 227</ref> Cooney observed in her initial report that children had an \"affinity for commercial jingles\",<ref>Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 17</ref> so many of the show's songs were like television advertisements.\n\nTo attract the best composers and lyricists, and to encourage them to compose more music for the series, the CTW allowed songwriters to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. For the first time in children's television, the writers earned lucrative profits, which as Davis reported, \"helped the show sustain the level of public interest in the show\".<ref name=\"davis-256\">Davis, p. 256</ref> Scriptwriters often wrote their own lyrics to accompany their scripts.<ref name=\"davis-256\"/> Songwriters of note were [[Joe Raposo]], [[Jeff Moss]], [[Christopher Cerf (producer)|Christopher Cerf]], [[Tony Geiss]], and [[Norman Stiles]].

Television producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and foundation executive [[Lloyd Morrisett]] developed the idea to form an organization to produce ''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television series which would help children, especially those from low-income families, prepare for school. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new series. Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was termed \"one of the most important television developments of the decade\".<ref name=\"davis125126\" />\n\n''Sesame Street'' premiered as a series on [[National Educational Television]] (NET) in the United States on November 10, 1969, and moved to NET's successor, the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]), in late 1970. The Workshop was formally incorporated in 1970. [[Gerald S. Lesser]] and [[Edward L. Palmer]] were hired to perform research for the series; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later termed the \"CTW model\". They also hired a staff of producers and writers. After the initial success of ''Sesame Street'', they began to plan for its continued survival, which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other television series. The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985.\n\nAfter ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the ''Sesame Street'' [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppets]] accounted for $15\u201317 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees.

Operating costs included salaries, $6 million in rent for its [[Lincoln Center]] corporate offices, its production facilities in Queens, and the costs of producing content for its YouTube channels and other outlets.  The organization employed about 400 people, including \"several highly skilled puppeteers\".  Royalties and distribution fees, which accounted for $52.9 million in 2018, made up the Workshop's biggest revenue source.  Donations brought in $47.8 million, or 31 percent of its income.  Licensing revenue from games, toys, and clothing earned the SW $4.5 million.<ref name=\"guthrie2\"/>\n\n== Funding sources ==\nAfter ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since its funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them.<ref name=\"davis-203\">Davis, p. 203</ref> Although the organization was what Cooney termed \"the darling of the federal government for a brief period of two or three years\",<ref>Davis, p. 218</ref> its first ten years of existence was marked by conflicts between the two; in 1978, the [[US Department of Education]] refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of the CTW's fiscal year.<ref>O'Dell, p. 73</ref> According to Davis, the federal government was opposed to funding public television, but the Workshop used Cooney's prestige and fame, and the fact that there would be \"great public outcry\"<ref name=\"wershba-6\" /> if the series was de-funded, to withstand the government's attacks on PBS. Eventually, the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget.<ref>Davis, pp. 218\u2013219</ref>  By 2019, the U.S. government donated about four percent of the Workshop's budget, or less than $5 million a year.<ref name=\"guthrie2\"/>\n\n[[File:Jim Henson (1989).jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=A tall, thin man in his early fifties, with salty-gray hair and a full beard, and wearing a tuxedo.|[[Jim Henson]], creator of [[the Muppets]], in 1989]]\n\nFor the first time, a public broadcasting series had the potential to earn a great deal of money.  Immediately after its premiere, ''Sesame Street ''gained attention from marketers,<ref name=\"davis-203\" /> so the Workshop explored sources such as licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales, and became, as Cooney envisioned, a \"multiple media institution\".<ref name=\"cherow-197\">Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 197</ref> Licensing became the foundation of, as writer Louise Gikow stated, the Sesame Workshop endowment,<ref name=\"gikow-268\">Gikow, p. 268</ref> which had the potential to fund the organization and future productions and projects.<ref name=\"davis-205\" /> Muppet creator [[Jim Henson]] owned the trademarks to the [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppet characters]]: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control of all products and product decisions throughout its history; any product line associated with the series had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during broadcastings of ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Davis, pp. 203\u2013205</ref> As Davis reported, \"Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution\" in their marketing and licensing efforts.<ref>Davis, p. 204</ref> In the early 1970s, the CTW negotiated with the company [[Random House]] to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division. Random House and the CTW named [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]] to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the series' curriculum.<ref name=\"davis-205\">Davis, p. 205</ref>  By 2019, the Sesame Workshop had over 500 licensing agreements, and its total revenue in 2018 was $35 million.  A million children play with ''Sesame Street''-themed toys per day.<ref name=\"wallace\"/><ref name=\"guthrie\"/>\n\nSoon after the premiere of ''Sesame Street'', producers, educators, and officials of other nations began requesting that a version of the series be broadcast in their countries. [[CBS]] executive [[Michael Dann]] was required to quit his job at that network due to a change of corporate policy preceding the so-called \"[[rural purge]]\"; upon his ouster, he became vice-president of the CTW and Cooney's assistant.{{refn|group=note|Dann called the creation of the CTW \"one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of the mass media\".<ref>Lesser, p. 36</ref>}} Dann then began developing foreign versions of ''Sesame Street''<ref name=\"cole-147\"/> by arranging what were eventually termed [[International co-productions of Sesame Street|co-productions]], or independent programs with their own sets, characters, and curriculum goals. By 2009, ''Sesame Street'' had expanded into 140 countries;<ref>Gikow, p. 11</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in 2005 that income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million.<ref>Carvajal, Doreen (12 December 2005).

The Workshop decided that all materials its licensing program created would \"underscore and amplify\"<ref name=\"davis-205\" /> the series' curriculum. Coloring books, for example, were prohibited because the Workshop felt they would restrict children's imaginations.<ref name=\"gikow-268\" /> The CTW published ''Sesame Street Magazine'' in 1970, which incorporated the show's curriculum goals in a magazine format.<ref>Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 198</ref> As with the series, research was performed for the magazine, initially by CTW's research department for a year and a half, and then by the Magazine Research Group in 1975.<ref name=\"cherow-197\" />\n\nWorking with [[Random House]] editor Jason Epstein, the CTW hired Christopher Cerf to manage ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s book publishing program.<ref name=\"gikow-268\" /><ref name=\"davis-205\" /> During the division's first year, Cerf earned $900,000 for the CTW. He quit to become more involved with writing and composing music for the series,<ref>Davis, p. 206</ref> and was replaced eventually by Bill Whaley. Ann Kearns, vice president of licensing for the CTW in 2000, stated that Whaley was responsible for expanding the licensing to other products, and for creating a licensing model used by other children's series.<ref name=\"gikow-268\" /> As of 2019, the Workshop had published over 6,500 book titles.<ref name=\"guthrie\"/> and as researcher Renee Cherow-O'Leary stated in 2001, \"the print materials produced by CTW have been an enduring part of the legacy of Sesame Street\".<ref name=\"cherow-197\" /> In one of these books, for example, the death of the ''Sesame Street'' character [[Mr. Hooper]] was featured in a book entitled ''I'll Miss You, Mr. Hooper'', published soon after the series featured it in 1983.<ref>Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 210</ref>  In 2019, ''Parade Magazine'' reported that 20 million copies of ''[[The Monster at the End of This Book: Starring Lovable, Furry Old Grover|The Monster at the End of the Book]]'' and ''Another Monster at the End of this Book'' had been sold, making them the top two best-selling e-books sold.<ref name=\"wallace\"/>  Its [[YouTube]] channel had almost 5 million subscribers.<ref name=\"guthrie\"/>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Sesame Street}}\n\nAccording to director Jon Stone, the music of ''Sesame Street'' was unlike any other children's program on television.<ref>Gikow, p. 220</ref> For the first time, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and was related to its curriculum.<ref>Gikow, p. 227</ref> Cooney observed in her initial report that children had an \"affinity for commercial jingles\",<ref>Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 17</ref> so many of the show's songs were like television advertisements.\n\nTo attract the best composers and lyricists, and to encourage them to compose more music for the series, the CTW allowed songwriters to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. For the first time in children's television, the writers earned lucrative profits, which as Davis reported, \"helped the show sustain the level of public interest in the show\".<ref name=\"davis-256\">Davis, p. 256</ref> Scriptwriters often wrote their own lyrics to accompany their scripts.<ref name=\"davis-256\"/> Songwriters of note were [[Joe Raposo]], [[Jeff Moss]], [[Christopher Cerf (producer)|Christopher Cerf]], [[Tony Geiss]], and [[Norman Stiles]].

{"title_page": "Creative real estate investing", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Unreferenced|date=August 2008}}\n{{notability|date=December 2012}}\n}}\n\n'''Creative real estate investing''' is any non-traditional method of buying and selling [[real estate]]. [[Confidence tricks]] and [[pyramid schemes]] in the 20th and 21st century such as [[Nouveau Riche (real estate investment college)]] have embraced the term, leading contemporary usage of the term to be synonymous with unscrupulous practices.\n\n==Bird-dogging==\n\"Bird dogs\" get paid a referral fee for finding good deals for other [[investors]].  This is often where people begin their investing career as there is only time at stake. They are typically paid when the deal closes. Some birddogs will structure companies and partnership arrangements as they're frequently not real estate agents and may not be able to collect a \"referral fee\" for their services. These partnership are often structured utilizing a joint venture (JV) agreement.\n\n==Options==\n{{Main|Option (finance)}}\nAn option is defined as the right to buy a property for a specified price (strike price) during a specified period of time.  An owner of a property may sell an option for someone to buy it on or before a future date at a predetermined price.  The buyer of the option hopes the value of the property will either go up or is already low.  The seller receives a premium called \"option consideration\".  The buyer may then either exercise the option by buying the property or sell the option to someone else to exercise (or sell).  This is often done to obtain control over a property without much cash.  Option premiums are typically non-refundable.  The option represents an equitable interest in the property and may be recorded at the county recorders office.\n\n==Short sale or preforeclosure==\nWhen a property owner fails to make their [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] payments for a number of months they are in default<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsilver.com/the-lender/how-to-buy-foreclosed-homes-in-florida/|title=How To Buy Foreclosed Homes In Florida|date=2020-04-07|website=New Silver|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>.  The first step of the [[foreclosure]] process (which typically takes a number of months) that the lender will take is to file the notice of default.  This is a public document that is recorded.  The property owner will contract to sell the home conditioned upon the lender accepting a lesser amount than what is owed on the mortgage. Note that there are no similarities between a real estate short sale and selling a stock short.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, including the United States, the seller is responsible for taxes on the amount of the mortgage left unpaid after the sale as ordinary income.\n\nThe Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, enacted Dec 20, 2007, generally allows taxpayers to exclude income from the discharge of debt on their principal residence. Debt reduced through mortgage restructuring, as well as mortgage debt forgiven in connection with a foreclosure, qualifies for the relief.  The original effective date was through 2009 but in October 2008, legislation extended the relief through 2012.  Use IRS form 982 to handle the debt relief provision.\n\n== Hard money lenders ==\nThese are often used to finance projects that are unconventional, great deals, or where money is needed quickly.  Typically [[hard money lender]]s will lend 50-70% of the value of the property regardless of the sales price (unlike banks).  They will typically close loans in 2\u20137 days.

They may get paid via points (e.g. 1 point equals one percent of the total amount borrowed), interest rate (10-20% per year is common), and an equitable interest.  These will vary based on the size of the project and the agreed upon contract.  Hard money lenders are [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] based and typically require first position on the property.\n\n== Tax liens ==\n{{Main|Tax liens}}\nThis may not clearly fall in the category of \"real estate investing\", however it is worth mentioning.  Each state creates the system and rules for the [[lien]] or [[deed]] process so careful research is necessary.  In general, property owners are notified regarding the amount of taxes owed and are given a period of time to pay.  If the amount remains delinquent, the state will take one of the following paths (though some have created a hybrid):\n\n=== Tax lien state ===\nThe county in which the property is located sells the lien certificate at a sale or [[auction]].  Some states sell the lien for the [[wikt:delinquent|delinquent]] amount while others allow bidding to begin at that price.  The purchaser of the tax lien collects interest (predetermined by the state) from the home owner on the amount that was paid for the tax lien.  If the tax lien (with interest) goes unpaid during the redemption period, the investor may foreclose on the home.  Unlike most foreclosures, when a tax lien is foreclosed on, all other liens and mortgages are abolished and the property would be owned \"free and clear\".  Typically the lender will pay off the tax lien to avoid losing their [[house]] and/or property.\n\n=== Tax deed state ===\nThe [[county government]] sells the deed to the property at a public sale or auction.  The benefit for investors is the ability to purchase property at discounted rates, often for the amount owed in taxes.  When an account becomes delinquent, the property is listed at the tax assessor's office, some are even [[online]].  Properties with homes are usually purchased by investors (often referred to as sharks) prior to foreclosure.\n\n== Paper/notes/mortgage investing ==\nThis also is less of a \"creative real estate investing\" technique as typically described.  Mortgages are often sold by lenders to other lending institutions.  Investors can [[broker]] transactions by arranging buyers and sellers of notes to meet or by buying them and immediately selling them for a profit.\n\n== Flipping ==\n{{Main|Flipping}}\nFlipping is buying an under priced property and then quickly reselling it at market value.  Homes are typically sold below value by uninformed sellers or those in distress (like job loss or foreclosure).  Often a property is sold under market value because it is a \"fixer upper\".  Sometimes they require very little such as paint and carpet and other times they have [[mold]], [[asbestos]], or foundation issues.  These inherently hold more risk and more work, and therefore often have substantial profits.\n\n== Land trust ==\n{{Main|Land trust}}\nLand Trusts have traditionally been used as a [[non-profit]] entity to own property.  In recent years, many companies have developed methodologies that allow for Land Trusts to be used to acquire properties in [[foreclosure]] allowing homeowners to save their homes and making it possible for investors to see incredible returns.  In a Real Estate Investment model Land Trusts bring ease to the transaction. While some people believe that using a Land Trust also brings a benefit of not causing [[Due-on-sale clause]]s to force the [[refinancing]] of the subject property, this is only true when the  borrower is and remains a beneficiary of the trust and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property. While the use of Land Trusts by real estate investors does make it more difficult for a lender to discover a transfer has occurred, the loan can still be accelerated if it is discovered since a transfer has occurred.\n\nBy federal law a transfer to a trustee in an inter vivos trust (to which classification a ''residential property land trust'' belongs) cannot be considered a due-on-sale (''due-on-transfer'') violation unless all of one's beneficiary interest would have been transferred to another.  Title 12 of the US Code Para. 1701-j-3 - i.e., the [[Garn\u2013St. Germain Depository Institutions Act]] of 1982, specifically makes this point.\n\nWhat this means is that a partial beneficiary interest, of one to ninety-nine percent, can be given (assigned) to a co-beneficiary without triggering a lender's alienation recourse (i.e., the due-on-sale penalty requiring immediate satisfaction in-full of the mortgage loan.\n\nIn so much as the land trust is ''beneficiary-directed'' rather than being directed and managed by its trustee, a ''remainder agent'' (i.e., a party appointed to assume responsibility for the trust and its corpus in the event of the death or incapacity of the original director-manager beneficiary) can be a remainder ''beneficiary'' (co-beneficiary), rather than needing to be remainder ''trustee'', as would be the case with the standard, and far more common, trustee-directed inter vivos trust (i.e., the fully funded inter vivos family trust).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Private investment capital subscription]]\n* [[Real estate investing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Real estate investing]]\n[[Category:Real estate investment trusts]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Unreferenced|date=August 2008}}\n{{notability|date=December 2012}}\n}}\n\n'''Creative real estate investing''' is any non-traditional method of buying and selling [[real estate]]. [[Confidence tricks]] and [[pyramid schemes]] in the 20th and 21st century such as [[Nouveau Riche (real estate investment college)]] have embraced the term, leading contemporary usage of the term to be synonymous with unscrupulous practices.\n\n==Bird-dogging==\n\"Bird dogs\" get paid a referral fee for finding good deals for other [[investors]].  This is often where people begin their investing career as there is only time at stake. They are typically paid when the deal closes. Some birddogs will structure companies and partnership arrangements as they're frequently not real estate agents and may not be able to collect a \"referral fee\" for their services. These partnership are often structured utilizing a joint venture (JV) agreement.\n\n==Options==\n{{Main|Option (finance)}}\nAn option is defined as the right to buy a property for a specified price (strike price) during a specified period of time.  An owner of a property may sell an option for someone to buy it on or before a future date at a predetermined price.  The buyer of the option hopes the value of the property will either go up or is already low.  The seller receives a premium called \"option consideration\".  The buyer may then either exercise the option by buying the property or sell the option to someone else to exercise (or sell).  This is often done to obtain control over a property without much cash.  Option premiums are typically non-refundable.  The option represents an equitable interest in the property and may be recorded at the county recorders office.\n\n==Short sale or preforeclosure==\nWhen a property owner fails to make their [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] payments for a number of months they are in default.  The first step of the [[foreclosure]] process (which typically takes a number of months) that the lender will take is to file the notice of default.  This is a public document that is recorded.  The property owner will contract to sell the home conditioned upon the lender accepting a lesser amount than what is owed on the mortgage. Note that there are no similarities between a real estate short sale and selling a stock short.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, including the United States, the seller is responsible for taxes on the amount of the mortgage left unpaid after the sale as ordinary income.\n\nThe Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007, enacted Dec 20, 2007, generally allows taxpayers to exclude income from the discharge of debt on their principal residence. Debt reduced through mortgage restructuring, as well as mortgage debt forgiven in connection with a foreclosure, qualifies for the relief.  The original effective date was through 2009 but in October 2008, legislation extended the relief through 2012.  Use IRS form 982 to handle the debt relief provision.\n\n== Hard money lenders ==\nThese are often used to finance projects that are unconventional, great deals, or where money is needed quickly.  Typically [[hard money lender]]s will lend 50-70% of the value of the property regardless of the sales price (unlike banks).  They will typically close loans in 2\u20137 days.  [[Credit score]]s and [[income]] are often overlooked by hard money lenders, however they may ask to see a business plan or exit strategy for the project.  They may get paid via points (e.g. 1 point equals one percent of the total amount borrowed), interest rate (10-20% per year is common), and an equitable interest.  These will vary based on the size of the project and the agreed upon contract.  Hard money lenders are [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] based and typically require first position on the property.\n\n== Tax liens ==\n{{Main|Tax liens}}\nThis may not clearly fall in the category of \"real estate investing\", however it is worth mentioning.

The first time was in [[1450]], when they helped [[Francesco I Sforza]] become [[duke of Milan]]. In [[February]] the Venetians had sent an ambassador, Leonardo Venieri, to negotiate the city's surrender and help them defeat Sforza.

The first time was in [[1450]], when they helped [[Francesco I Sforza]] become [[duke of Milan]]. In [[February]] the Venetians had sent an ambassador, Leonardo Venieri, to negotiate the city's surrender and help them defeat Sforza. Giovanni Stampa marched onto the city with his army and killed Venieri on the stairs of [[Royal Palace of Milan|Palazzo Ducale]], ''de facto'' forcing Milan to surrender to Francesco I.

Far too long.--> \nThe story portrays the lives of two orphan girls, Isha and Ira who do not give up despite facing many hardships in life. Their mother died, their father abandoned them, and they are left to fend for themselves. Their father has to give them up because he is marrying someone else. They are sent to live in an orphanage with Devki and her brother Bhola.\n\nAt first the kids don't like them because they escaped and they had to starve. But Isha comes back because Ira was sick and she sprained her leg. Devki is trying to separate Isha and Ira by telling Ira bad stuff about Isha. Also Isha finds out that Tinnu (a boy whom also escaped the orphanage and they helped him but got caught by Bhola) is in the dark room and he had to starve because he helped Isha escape. Meanwhile, Vrinda (the person in charge of everyone) hates Isha because she caused a lot of trouble for them. But one day when a guy named Arjun comes to deliver food, he meets Vrinda. They become friends and Arjun writes Vrinda letters. They both fall in love. Bhola finds out and warns Vrinda. To get revenge Vrinda mixes spices in Bhola's breakfast. Bhola tells Devki and threatens Isha to tell the truth. Devki says that she will accept any condition if she says who did it. Isha takes the blame and tells Devki to release Tinnu. Tinnu is really very sick. Thakur and Fatima likes Isha now but Vrinda and Cutting are still upset. Thakur, Fatima, and Isha try to take care of Tinnu but their efforts are in vain. Isha collects money and the kids help her. Vrinda comes and wants to help and prove she's better than Isha, so they tell Vrinda to try to convince Devki to get a doctor. The doctor comes and cures Tinnu.\n\nJust as relation was going to be fixed as Isha gives rice with milk to Vrinda. Devki comes in and degrades Vrinda while teasing her by announcing Isha is the new manager for the kids, causing Vrinda to hate her more. Arjun becomes a famous businessman that wants to adopt Vrinda. He talks to Vrinda alone and they both confess their love to each other. Bhola finds out that that man was Arjun and tells Devki. Isha warns Vrinda about it and Arjun leaves, she covers up the ordeal. Devki tells her men to check all of Vrinda's belongings. A letter that Arjun gave to Vrinda falls out and Bhola sees this. While Devki is trying to get it Isha took it and ate it. When she goes to beat Isha, Ira bites her arm. Devki tries to hit Ira bit Isha stops her. Isha tells her that while she is here she will change everything. Devki is embarrassed and leaves. Vrinda apologizes to Isha for being mean to her and they both are friends now.\n\nOutside Tinnu sees Bhola and Devki talking to a foreigner. After the foreigner leaves, Devki tells the kids that she is sorry and tells them that they could do whatever they want to. Tinnu suspects her and tells Isha and Vrinda about this. Isha follows Devki and Bhola and finds out that the foreigner is the owner of the biggest adoption center in America. He wants two little cute girls so he can take them to America and someone could adopt them. Devki wants to sell Ira and Chutki to the foreigner. Isha is shocked and tells Arjun, Vrinda and Tinnu. When Devki is giving Ira and Chutki to the foreigner, Chetna comes. Devki kicks the foreigner out immediately. Every one were confused. They think that Chetna will buy one of the kids but Isha finds out that Chetna is the real owner of the place. She is really nice to all the children, gives them new clothes, good food, and new toys. On the day of Isha's birthday, Chetna organises a party for her. But Isha, Tinnu, Vrinda and all the kids plan to get Devki and Bhola kicked out from the orphanage. Isha calls some people to buy a child. Chetna sees this and Devki blames it on Bhola, who is then kicked out.\n\nThey all celebrate Isha's birthday and everyone is happy. Later one day, Isha goes to buy groceries with Calender. She sees a boy asking everyone about an orphanage and thinks he is a pickpocket. When he comes to her, they both drop their papers. Isha's paper had the groceries list and items, and his has the address to the orphanage. They accidentally pick up the wrong paper and he follows her there. He comes to the orphanage and everyone finds out his name: Samarth or Sam. He came from America and is Chetna's grandson. He tells everyone to hide him from Chetna for two days so Chetna doesn't send him back. Chetna gets a phone call from his mom saying he was supposed to go to summer camp but he's not there. Chetna is really worried and Devki thinks it's a good opportunity to send Chetna back but Isha tells her the truth. Sam is mad at Isha for telling Chetna the truth. Sam convinces Chetna to go to America with him and she agrees. Everyone is upset while Devki is happy. Meanwhile, Tinnu and Sam constantly fight a lot and argue. They both hate each other. Chetna borrows a baby from one of the guards and tells everyone on the street that until she is not adopted she won't go anywhere. The kids are all happy. Chetna tells Isha; she did it all this so Sam could become a responsible person. She assigns Isha, Tinnu and Sam to take care of the baby. Sam and Tinnu try to get along but they still fight. Sam is changing. Chetna is proud of Isha. Devki in a fit of greed for money teams up with Sam's mother to burn the orphanage. This causes all of the kids to be separated from each other, even Isha and Ira.\n\n===Ten years later===\nIsha tries to find Ira with the help of Devki. Isha works at a radio station as DJ Palak and has to go by the name Palak. Her only aim in joining the radio station is to find her sister, Ira. She hopes and prays Ira will listen to her and recognize her.\n\nIra grows up to be a rich and a spoiled brat. However, there is a humane side to her too. She grows up hating Isha because she believes Isha chose Kuhu over her.\n\nAngry about her past, Ira erases all memories of her childhood and even assumes a new identity. She changes her name to Kajal Kaushal. However, destiny brings Isha and Ira together once again. Unaware of their shared past, the duo meet and become best friends, as Ira invites DJ Palak (Isha) to her 18th birthday party and Isha finds it awkward that Kajal and Ira's birthday is on the same day. Everyone is happy until police come and arrest everyone at the party because there was something wrong. Palak doesn't get arrested because she was from the radio station and she helps Kajal by saying that she works there to.\n\nFate brings Samarth Ojha and Isha together too when he joins Isha's radio station as a trainee. Samarth Ojha (Sam) has come from abroad and joins the radio as a trainee. But Isha and the whole office discover that Sam is actually the owner of the radio station, he joins as a trainee because he learns that there was a lot of mess and fraud in the radio station.\n\nIsha and Ira are reunited, but Ira still hates Isha. Revati (Samarth's mom) absolutely loathes Isha and fills Ira's heart with hate towards her sister. Isha and Sam are to be married and Ira and Revati conjure many plans to stop the wedding. Isha finds out that Ira still loves Sam and hates her. Isha lets Ira marry Sam, but instead she gets married to Shravan (One of Palak's fans and is in love with Isha) who tied Sam up. Shravan and Ira don't get on, and they make each other miserable. Revathi pushes Isha off the balcony and thinks Isha is dead. Later on IRA and Shravan fall in love, Ira also realises her mistakes and apologises to Isha. Isha is haunting Revathi, and Isha is revealed to be alive, with the help of the family Revathi is exposed and arrested. A young boy comes to the House which is later revealed to be the sisters younger half brother Govinda. Revathi escapes jail and kidnaps Govinda, but his family saves him. Revathi is arrested again. Isha and Ira are reunited with their father. Govinda draws a picture which he names Chhoti si Zindagi.

Far too long.--> \nThe story portrays the lives of two orphan girls, Isha and Ira who do not give up despite facing many hardships in life. Their mother died, their father abandoned them, and they are left to fend for themselves. Their father has to give them up because he is marrying someone else. They are sent to live in an orphanage with Devki and her brother Bhola.\n\nAt first the kids don't like them because they escaped and they had to starve. But Isha comes back because Ira was sick and she sprained her leg. Devki is trying to separate Isha and Ira by telling Ira bad stuff about Isha. Also Isha finds out that Tinnu (a boy whom also escaped the orphanage and they helped him but got caught by Bhola) is in the dark room and he had to starve because he helped Isha escape. Meanwhile, Vrinda (the person in charge of everyone) hates Isha because she caused a lot of trouble for them. But one day when a guy named Arjun comes to deliver food, he meets Vrinda. They become friends and Arjun writes Vrinda letters. They both fall in love. Bhola finds out and warns Vrinda. To get revenge Vrinda mixes spices in Bhola's breakfast. Bhola tells Devki and threatens Isha to tell the truth. Devki says that she will accept any condition if she says who did it. Isha takes the blame and tells Devki to release Tinnu. Tinnu is really very sick. Thakur and Fatima likes Isha now but Vrinda and Cutting are still upset. Thakur, Fatima, and Isha try to take care of Tinnu but their efforts are in vain. Isha collects money and the kids help her. Vrinda comes and wants to help and prove she's better than Isha, so they tell Vrinda to try to convince Devki to get a doctor. The doctor comes and cures Tinnu.\n\nJust as relation was going to be fixed as Isha gives rice with milk to Vrinda. Devki comes in and degrades Vrinda while teasing her by announcing Isha is the new manager for the kids, causing Vrinda to hate her more. Arjun becomes a famous businessman that wants to adopt Vrinda. He talks to Vrinda alone and they both confess their love to each other. Bhola finds out that that man was Arjun and tells Devki. Isha warns Vrinda about it and Arjun leaves, she covers up the ordeal. Devki tells her men to check all of Vrinda's belongings. A letter that Arjun gave to Vrinda falls out and Bhola sees this. While Devki is trying to get it Isha took it and ate it. When she goes to beat Isha, Ira bites her arm. Devki tries to hit Ira bit Isha stops her. Isha tells her that while she is here she will change everything. Devki is embarrassed and leaves. Vrinda apologizes to Isha for being mean to her and they both are friends now.\n\nOutside Tinnu sees Bhola and Devki talking to a foreigner. After the foreigner leaves, Devki tells the kids that she is sorry and tells them that they could do whatever they want to. Tinnu suspects her and tells Isha and Vrinda about this. Isha follows Devki and Bhola and finds out that the foreigner is the owner of the biggest adoption center in America. He wants two little cute girls so he can take them to America and someone could adopt them. Devki wants to sell Ira and Chutki to the foreigner. Isha is shocked and tells Arjun, Vrinda and Tinnu. When Devki is giving Ira and Chutki to the foreigner, Chetna comes. Devki kicks the foreigner out immediately. Every one were confused. They think that Chetna will buy one of the kids but Isha finds out that Chetna is the real owner of the place. She is really nice to all the children, gives them new clothes, good food, and new toys. On the day of Isha's birthday, Chetna organises a party for her. But Isha, Tinnu, Vrinda and all the kids plan to get Devki and Bhola kicked out from the orphanage. Isha calls some people to buy a child. Chetna sees this and Devki blames it on Bhola, who is then kicked out.\n\nThey all celebrate Isha's birthday and everyone is happy. Later one day, Isha goes to buy groceries with Calender. She sees a boy asking everyone about an orphanage and thinks he is a pickpocket. When he comes to her, they both drop their papers. Isha's paper had the groceries list and items, and his has the address to the orphanage. They accidentally pick up the wrong paper and he follows her there. He comes to the orphanage and everyone finds out his name: Samarth or Sam. He came from America and is Chetna's grandson. He tells everyone to hide him from Chetna for two days so Chetna doesn't send him back. Chetna gets a phone call from his mom saying he was supposed to go to summer camp but he's not there. Chetna is really worried and Devki thinks it's a good opportunity to send Chetna back but Isha tells her the truth. Sam is mad at Isha for telling Chetna the truth. Sam convinces Chetna to go to America with him and she agrees. Everyone is upset while Devki is happy. Meanwhile, Tinnu and Sam constantly fight a lot and argue. They both hate each other. Chetna borrows a baby from one of the guards and tells everyone on the street that until she is not adopted she won't go anywhere. The kids are all happy. Chetna tells Isha; she did it all this so Sam could become a responsible person. She assigns Isha, Tinnu and Sam to take care of the baby. Sam and Tinnu try to get along but they still fight. Sam is changing. Chetna is proud of Isha. Devki in a fit of greed for money teams up with Sam's mother to burn the orphanage. This causes all of the kids to be separated from each other, even Isha and Ira.\n\n===Ten years later===\nIsha tries to find Ira with the help of Devki. Isha works at a radio station as DJ Palak and has to go by the name Palak. Her only aim in joining the radio station is to find her sister, Ira. She hopes and prays Ira will listen to her and recognize her.\n\nIra grows up to be a rich and a spoiled brat. However, there is a humane side to her too. She grows up hating Isha because she believes Isha chose Kuhu over her.\n\nAngry about her past, Ira erases all memories of her childhood and even assumes a new identity. She changes her name to Kajal Kaushal. However, destiny brings Isha and Ira together once again. Unaware of their shared past, the duo meet and become best friends, as Ira invites DJ Palak (Isha) to her 18th birthday party and Isha finds it awkward that Kajal and Ira's birthday is on the same day. Everyone is happy until police come and arrest everyone at the party because there was something wrong. Palak doesn't get arrested because she was from the radio station and she helps Kajal by saying that she works there to.\n\nFate brings Samarth Ojha and Isha together too when he joins Isha's radio station as a trainee. Samarth Ojha (Sam) has come from abroad and joins the radio as a trainee. But Isha and the whole office discover that Sam is actually the owner of the radio station, he joins as a trainee because he learns that there was a lot of mess and fraud in the radio station.\n\nIsha and Ira are reunited, but Ira still hates Isha. Revati (Samarth's mom) absolutely loathes Isha and fills Ira's heart with hate towards her sister. Isha and Sam are to be married and Ira and Revati conjure many plans to stop the wedding. Isha finds out that Ira still loves Sam and hates her. Isha lets Ira marry Sam, but instead she gets married to Shravan (One of Palak's fans and is in love with Isha) who tied Sam up. Shravan and Ira don't get on, and they make each other miserable. Revathi pushes Isha off the balcony and thinks Isha is dead. Later on IRA and Shravan fall in love, Ira also realises her mistakes and apologises to Isha. Isha is haunting Revathi, and Isha is revealed to be alive, with the help of the family Revathi is exposed and arrested. A young boy comes to the House which is later revealed to be the sisters younger half brother Govinda. Revathi escapes jail and kidnaps Govinda, but his family saves him. Revathi is arrested again. Isha and Ira are reunited with their father. Govinda draws a picture which he names Chhoti si Zindagi. The sisters have their happy ending.\n\n==Other telecasts==\nIt came back on 3 January 2012 on Disney Channel India.

It is thus an [[extracorporeal]] therapy.\n\nThe apheresis machine was invented by American medical technologist Herb Cullis in 1972.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Did you know? 10 Historical Facts about Blood Transfusion\n| first = | last = \n| website = \n| date = \n| accessdate = 2019-01-23\n| url = https://www.nzblood.co.nz/news/2015/did-you-know-10-historical-facts-about-blood-transfusion/\n| language =  \n| quote = \n}}</ref>\n\nOne of the uses of apheresis is for collecting stem cells.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Official CPC Certification Study Guide|last=Katherine|first=Abel|publisher=American Medical Association|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=128}}</ref> \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Method ==\n\nDepending on the substance that is being removed, different processes are employed in apheresis. If separation by [[density]] is required, [[centrifugation]] is the most common method. Other methods involve absorption onto beads coated with an absorbent material and filtration.\n\nThe centrifugation method can be divided into two basic categories:\n\n=== Continuous flow centrifugation ===\n\nContinuous flow centrifugation (CFC) historically required two [[venipunctures]] as the \"continuous\" means the blood is collected, spun, and returned simultaneously. Newer systems can use a single venipuncture. The main advantage of this system is the low extracorporeal volume (calculated by volume of the apheresis chamber, the donor's [[hematocrit]], and total blood volume of the donor) used in the procedure, which may be advantageous in the elderly and for children.\n\n=== Intermittent flow centrifugation ===\n\nIntermittent flow centrifugation works in cycles, taking blood, spinning/processing it and then giving back the unused parts to the donor in a [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]]. The main advantage is a single venipuncture site. To stop the blood from [[Coagulation|coagulating]], [[anticoagulant]] is automatically mixed with the blood as it is pumped from the body into the apheresis machine.\n\n=== Centrifugation variables ===\n\nThe centrifugation process itself has four variables that can be controlled to selectively remove desired components. The first is spin speed and bowl diameter, the second is \"sit time\" in centrifuge, the third is solutes added, and the fourth is not as easily controllable: plasma volume and cellular content of the donor. The end product in most cases is the classic sedimented blood sample with the [[Red blood cells|RBC's]] at the bottom, the [[buffy coat]] of platelets and [[White blood cells|WBC's]] ([[lymphocytes]]/[[granulocytes]], [[Polymorphonuclear leukocytes|PMN's]], [[basophils]], [[eosinophils]]/[[monocytes]]) in the middle and the plasma on top.\n\n== Types ==\n\n[[Image:Blood donation needle.jpg|thumb|480px|Disinfect, insert the cannula, pull out the cannula, dress the wound. The blue pressure cuff is controlled by the platelet apheresis machine in newer models.]]\n\nThere are numerous types of apheresis.\n\n=== Donation ===\n\nBlood taken from a healthy donor can be separated into its component parts during [[blood donation]], where the needed component is collected and the \"unused\" components are returned to the donor. [[Fluid replacement]] is usually not needed in this type of collection.  There are large categories of component collections:\n\n* [[Plasmapheresis]] \u2013 [[blood plasma]]. Plasmapheresis is useful in collecting FFP (fresh frozen plasma) of a particular ABO group.  Commercial uses aside from FFP for this procedure include immunoglobulin products, plasma derivatives, and collection of rare WBC and RBC antibodies.\n* [[Erythrocytapheresis]] \u2013 [[red blood cells]].  Erythrocytapheresis is the separation of [[erythrocytes]] from whole blood.  It is most commonly accomplished using the method of centrifugal sedimentation.  This process is used for red blood cell diseases such as sickle cell crises or severe malaria.  The automated red blood cell collection procedure for donating erythrocytes is referred to as 'Double Reds' or 'Double Red Cell Apheresis.'<ref>[http://www.cc.nih.gov/dtm/dtm_double_red_cell.htm dtm double red cell<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705090407/http://www.cc.nih.gov/dtm/dtm_double_red_cell.htm |date=July 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n* [[Plateletpheresis]] (thrombapheresis, thrombocytapheresis) \u2013 [[platelet|blood platelets]]. Plateletpheresis is the collection of platelets by apheresis while returning the RBCs, WBCs, and component plasma. The yield is normally the equivalent of between six and ten random platelet concentrates. Quality control demands the platelets from apheresis be equal to or greater than 3.0 \u00d7 10<sup>11</sup> in number and have a pH of equal to or greater than 6.2 in 90% of the products tested and must be used within five days.\n* [[Leukapheresis]] \u2013 [[leukocytes]] (white blood cells). Leukopheresis is the removal of [[Granulocyte|PMN]]s, basophils, eosinophils for transfusion into patients whose PMNs are ineffective or where traditional therapy has failed.  There is limited data to suggest the benefit of granulocyte infusion.  The complications of this procedure are the difficulty in collection and short shelf life (24 hours at 20 to 24&nbsp;\u00b0C).  Since the \"buffy coat\" layer sits directly atop the RBC layer, HES, a sedimenting agent, is employed to improve yield while minimizing RBC collection.  Quality control demands the resultant concentrate be 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> granulocytes in 75% of the units tested and that the product be irradiated to avoid graft-versus-host disease (inactivate lymphocytes).

That fluid must be replaced to keep correct intravascular volume. The fluid replaced is different at different institutions. If a [[Volume expander#Types|crystalloid]] like [[normal saline]] (NS) is used, the infusion amount should be triple what is removed as the 3:1 ratio of normal saline for plasma is needed to keep up [[oncotic pressure]]. Some institutions use [[normal serum albumin]], but it is costly and can be difficult to find. Some advocate using [[fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP) or a similar blood product, but there are dangers including citrate toxicity (from the anticoagulant), [[ABO incompatibility]], [[infection]], and cellular [[antigen]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Leukoreduction]]\n* [[Plasmapheresis]]\n* [[Venipuncture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/red_cells.html NIH]\n* [http://www.apheresis.org American Society for Apheresis]\n* [http://stemcellthailand.org/pheresis-blood-platelet-donation-apheresis-hemapheresis Apheresis in Blood Platelet Donation]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408114722/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBAPHER.html WebPath] Apheresis page.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041205170749/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBPROC.html WebPath] Blood Donation and Processing\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081103014400/http://www.thebloodconnection.org/blood_products.aspx#platelets Donating Platelet Apheresis: Facts and the FAQ]\n\n{{transfusion medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Hematology]]\n[[Category:Medical treatments]]\n[[Category:Nephrology procedures]]\n[[Category:Transfusion medicine]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the linguistic term|Apheresis (linguistics)}}\n{{redirect-distinguish|Pheresis|Phoresis}}\n{{More footnotes|article|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox interventions |\n  Name        = Apheresis |\n  Image       = Image:Apheresis.svg |\n  Caption     = Whole blood enters the centrifuge (1) and separates into plasma (2), leukocytes (3), and erythrocytes (4).

If separation by [[density]] is required, [[centrifugation]] is the most common method. Other methods involve absorption onto beads coated with an absorbent material and filtration.\n\nThe centrifugation method can be divided into two basic categories:\n\n=== Continuous flow centrifugation ===\n\nContinuous flow centrifugation (CFC) historically required two [[venipunctures]] as the \"continuous\" means the blood is collected, spun, and returned simultaneously. Newer systems can use a single venipuncture. The main advantage of this system is the low extracorporeal volume (calculated by volume of the apheresis chamber, the donor's [[hematocrit]], and total blood volume of the donor) used in the procedure, which may be advantageous in the elderly and for children.\n\n=== Intermittent flow centrifugation ===\n\nIntermittent flow centrifugation works in cycles, taking blood, spinning/processing it and then giving back the unused parts to the donor in a [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]]. The main advantage is a single venipuncture site. To stop the blood from [[Coagulation|coagulating]], [[anticoagulant]] is automatically mixed with the blood as it is pumped from the body into the apheresis machine.\n\n=== Centrifugation variables ===\n\nThe centrifugation process itself has four variables that can be controlled to selectively remove desired components. The first is spin speed and bowl diameter, the second is \"sit time\" in centrifuge, the third is solutes added, and the fourth is not as easily controllable: plasma volume and cellular content of the donor. The end product in most cases is the classic sedimented blood sample with the [[Red blood cells|RBC's]] at the bottom, the [[buffy coat]] of platelets and [[White blood cells|WBC's]] ([[lymphocytes]]/[[granulocytes]], [[Polymorphonuclear leukocytes|PMN's]], [[basophils]], [[eosinophils]]/[[monocytes]]) in the middle and the plasma on top.\n\n== Types ==\n\n[[Image:Blood donation needle.jpg|thumb|480px|Disinfect, insert the cannula, pull out the cannula, dress the wound. The blue pressure cuff is controlled by the platelet apheresis machine in newer models.]]\n\nThere are numerous types of apheresis.\n\n=== Donation ===\n\nBlood taken from a healthy donor can be separated into its component parts during [[blood donation]], where the needed component is collected and the \"unused\" components are returned to the donor. [[Fluid replacement]] is usually not needed in this type of collection.  There are large categories of component collections:\n\n* [[Plasmapheresis]] \u2013 [[blood plasma]]. Plasmapheresis is useful in collecting FFP (fresh frozen plasma) of a particular ABO group.  Commercial uses aside from FFP for this procedure include immunoglobulin products, plasma derivatives, and collection of rare WBC and RBC antibodies.\n* [[Erythrocytapheresis]] \u2013 [[red blood cells]].  Erythrocytapheresis is the separation of [[erythrocytes]] from whole blood.  It is most commonly accomplished using the method of centrifugal sedimentation.  This process is used for red blood cell diseases such as sickle cell crises or severe malaria.  The automated red blood cell collection procedure for donating erythrocytes is referred to as 'Double Reds' or 'Double Red Cell Apheresis.'<ref>[http://www.cc.nih.gov/dtm/dtm_double_red_cell.htm dtm double red cell<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705090407/http://www.cc.nih.gov/dtm/dtm_double_red_cell.htm |date=July 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n* [[Plateletpheresis]] (thrombapheresis, thrombocytapheresis) \u2013 [[platelet|blood platelets]]. Plateletpheresis is the collection of platelets by apheresis while returning the RBCs, WBCs, and component plasma. The yield is normally the equivalent of between six and ten random platelet concentrates. Quality control demands the platelets from apheresis be equal to or greater than 3.0 \u00d7 10<sup>11</sup> in number and have a pH of equal to or greater than 6.2 in 90% of the products tested and must be used within five days.\n* [[Leukapheresis]] \u2013 [[leukocytes]] (white blood cells). Leukopheresis is the removal of [[Granulocyte|PMN]]s, basophils, eosinophils for transfusion into patients whose PMNs are ineffective or where traditional therapy has failed.  There is limited data to suggest the benefit of granulocyte infusion.  The complications of this procedure are the difficulty in collection and short shelf life (24 hours at 20 to 24&nbsp;\u00b0C).  Since the \"buffy coat\" layer sits directly atop the RBC layer, HES, a sedimenting agent, is employed to improve yield while minimizing RBC collection.  Quality control demands the resultant concentrate be 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> granulocytes in 75% of the units tested and that the product be irradiated to avoid graft-versus-host disease (inactivate lymphocytes).  Irradiation does not affect PMN function.

That fluid must be replaced to keep correct intravascular volume. The fluid replaced is different at different institutions. If a [[Volume expander#Types|crystalloid]] like [[normal saline]] (NS) is used, the infusion amount should be triple what is removed as the 3:1 ratio of normal saline for plasma is needed to keep up [[oncotic pressure]]. Some institutions use [[normal serum albumin]], but it is costly and can be difficult to find. Some advocate using [[fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP) or a similar blood product, but there are dangers including citrate toxicity (from the anticoagulant), [[ABO incompatibility]], [[infection]], and cellular [[antigen]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Leukoreduction]]\n* [[Plasmapheresis]]\n* [[Venipuncture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/red_cells.html NIH]\n* [http://www.apheresis.org American Society for Apheresis]\n* [http://stemcellthailand.org/pheresis-blood-platelet-donation-apheresis-hemapheresis Apheresis in Blood Platelet Donation]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408114722/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBAPHER.html WebPath] Apheresis page.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041205170749/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBPROC.html WebPath] Blood Donation and Processing\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081103014400/http://www.thebloodconnection.org/blood_products.aspx#platelets Donating Platelet Apheresis: Facts and the FAQ]\n\n{{transfusion medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Hematology]]\n[[Category:Medical treatments]]\n[[Category:Nephrology procedures]]\n[[Category:Transfusion medicine]]\n", "name_user": "Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m", "label": "safe", "comment": "formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apheresis"}

In [[February]] the Venetians had sent an ambassador, Leonardo Venieri, to negotiate the city's surrender and help them defeat Sforza. Giovanni Stampa marched onto the city with his army and killed Venieri on the stairs of [[Royal Palace of Milan|Palazzo Ducale]], forcing Milan to surrender to Francesco I.

These sources argue that the Stampa settled between [[Gravedona]] and [[Milan]], ruling over the [[Val Bregaglia]] and much of the surrounding regions. The best evidence for this would be the city of [[Stampa]], named so by the family in honour of its ancestors<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_UzEi2tO3LaEC|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_UzEi2tO3LaEC/page/n276 271]|quote=stefano stampa atene.|title=Notizie storiche intorno al comune di Gravedona ed alle principali sue famiglie dai tempi pi\u00f9 remoti fino al 1865|last=Stampa|first=Giuseppe|date=1866|publisher=D.

The earliest document Litta could find dates back to [[1277]], when the [[Archbishop of Milan|archbishop]] [[Ottone Visconti]] became [[List of rulers of Milan|Lord of Milan]]; it consists in a list compiled by Ottone himself, granting several privileges to the most influential families of the city, including Arrigo Stampa . \n\nThe Stampa decided of the destiny of Milan on more than one occasion. The first time was in [[1450]], when they helped [[Francesco I Sforza]] become [[duke of Milan]]. In [[February]] the Venetians had sent an ambassador, Leonardo Venieri, to negotiate the city's surrender and help them defeat Sforza. Giovanni Stampa marched onto the city with his army and killed Venieri on the stairs of [[Royal Palace of Milan|Palazzo Ducale]], forcing Milan to surrender to Francesco I. The newly elected [[Duke]] was naturally obliged to the family, and rewarded them with many honours<ref>{{Cite book|last=Litta|first=Conte Pompeo|title=Famous Italian Families|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>. \n\n== Stampa di Soncino ==\nIn [[1536]] Massimiliano Stampa was created [[Marquess]] of [[Soncino, Lombardy|Soncino]] by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The family ruled over [[Milan]] until [[1876]], and the city flourished immensely under their guidance. Massimiliano Cesare Stampa, the last Marquess of Soncino, died without children and donated his [[Soncino's Castle|castle]] to the [[Soncino, Lombardy|city]].
