It refers to metrics related to human characteristics .\nBiometrics authentication (or realistic authentication) is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control. It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under surveillance.\n\nBiometric identifiers are the distinctive, measurable characteristics used to label and describe individuals. Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological versus behavioral characteristics. Physiological characteristics are related to the shape of the body. Examples include, but are not limited to [[fingerprint]], palm veins, [[Facial recognition system|facerecognition]], [[DNA]], palmprint, [[Hand geometry|handgeometry]], [[Iris recognition|irisrecognition]], retina and odour/scent. Behavioral characteristics are related to the pattern of behavior of a person, including but not limited to typing rhythm, gait, and [[Human voice|voice]]. Some researchers have coined the term behaviometrics to describe the latter class of [[biometrics]].\n\nMore traditional means of access control include [[Token ring|token-based identification systems]], such as a driver's [[license]] or [[passport]], and knowledge-based identification systems, such as a password or personal identification number. Since biometric identifiers are unique to individuals, they are more reliable in verifying identity than token and knowledge-based methods; however, the collection of biometric identifiers raises privacy concerns about the ultimate use of this information.\n\n==Biometric functionality==\nMany different aspects of human physiology, chemistry or behavior can be used for [[Biometrical Journal|biometric]] [[authentication]]. The selection of a particular biometric for use in a specific application involves a weighting of several factors. Jain ''et al.'' (1999)<ref name=Jain2>{{Cite book\n | title = Biometrics: Personal Identification in Networked Society\n | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publications\n | editor-last = Jain\n | editor-first = A.

More specifically, a trait with 'good' permanence will be reasonably invariant over time with respect to the specific matching [[Algorithm|algorithm.]]\n* Measurability (collectability) relates to the ease of acquisition or measurement of the trait. In addition, acquired data should be in a form that permits subsequent processing and extraction of the relevant feature sets. \n* Performance relates to the accuracy, speed, and robustness of technology used (see [[Biometrics#Performance|performance]] section for more details). \n* Acceptability relates to how well individuals in the relevant population accept the technology such that they are willing to have their biometric trait captured and assessed. \n* Circumvention relates to the ease with which a trait might be imitated using an artifact or substitute.\n\nProper biometric use is very application dependent. Certain biometrics will be better than others based on the required levels of convenience and security.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/biometrics-comes-age|title = Biometrics comes of age: despite accuracy and security concerns, biometrics are gaining in popularity|last = Bleicher|first = Paul|date = 2005|journal = Applied Clinical Trials|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 6 December 2019}}</ref> No single biometric will meet all the requirements of every possible application.<ref name=Jain2 />\n\n[[File:Biometric system diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.5]]The block diagram illustrates the two basic modes of a biometric system.<ref name=\"Jain1\">{{Cite book|last=Jain|first=Anil K.|title=Handbook of Biometrics|last2=Ross|first2=Arun|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=978-0-387-71040-2|editor-last=Jain|editor-first=AK|pages=1\u201322|chapter=Introduction to Biometrics|editor2-last=Flynn|editor3-last=Ross|editor3-first=A|chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/computer/image+processing/book/978-1-4419-4375-0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309042959/http://www.springer.com/computer/image+processing/book/978-1-4419-4375-0|archivedate=9 March 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}{{payment required}}</ref> First, in [[Authentication|verification]] (or authentication) mode the system performs a one-to-one comparison of a captured biometric with a specific template stored in a biometric database in order to verify the individual is the person they claim to be.

In the second step, some samples are matched with reference models to generate the genuine and impostor scores and calculate the threshold. The third step is the testing step. This process may use a [[smart card]], username or ID number (e.g. [[Personal identification number|PIN]]) to indicate which template should be used for comparison.<ref group=\"note\">Systems can be designed to use a template stored on media like an [[Biometric passport|e-Passport]] or [[smart card]], rather than a remote database.</ref> 'Positive recognition' is a common use of the verification mode, \"where the aim is to prevent multiple people from using the same identity\".<ref name=Jain1 />\n\nSecond, in identification mode the system performs a one-to-many comparison against a biometric database in an attempt to establish the identity of an unknown individual. The system will succeed in identifying the individual if the comparison of the biometric sample to a template in the [[database]] falls within a previously set threshold. Identification mode can be used either for 'positive recognition' (so that the user does not have to provide any information about the template to be used) or for 'negative recognition' of the person \"where the system establishes whether the person is who she (implicitly or explicitly) denies to be\".<ref name=Jain1 /> The latter function can only be achieved through biometrics since other methods of personal recognition such as [[passwords]], PINs or keys are ineffective.\n\nThe first time an individual uses a biometric system is called ''enrollment''. During enrollment, biometric information from an individual is captured and stored. In subsequent uses, biometric information is detected and compared with the information stored at the time of enrollment. Note that it is crucial that storage and retrieval of such systems themselves be secure if the biometric system is to be robust. Biometric data is stored and processed with database servers, encrypted tokens, or physical tokens, while more secure devices will use on-device storage of biometric templates. This type of storage ensures identity authentication without the transference of any sensitive biometric information over the internet to a different server or location.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miteksystems.com/blog/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-biometrics|title=Advantages and disadvantages of Biometrics {{!}} Mitek|website=www.miteksystems.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> The first block (sensor) is the interface between the real world and the system; it has to acquire all the necessary data. Most of the times it is an image acquisition system, but it can change according to the characteristics desired. The second block performs all the necessary pre-processing: it has to remove [[artifact (error)|artifact]]s from the sensor, to enhance the input (e.g. removing background noise), to use some kind of [[normalization (image processing)|normalization]], etc. In the third block, necessary features are extracted. This step is an important step as the correct features need to be extracted in an optimal way. A vector of numbers or an image with particular properties is used to create a ''template''. A template is a synthesis of the relevant characteristics extracted from the source. Elements of the biometric measurement that are not used in the comparison algorithm are discarded in the template to reduce the filesize and to protect the identity of the enrollee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ievoreader.com/how-biometric-data-is-stored/|title=How Biometric Data is Stored|date=2018-12-10|website=ievo Ltd|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> However, depending on the scope of the biometric system, original biometric image sources may be retained such as the PIV-cards used in the Federal Information Processing Standard Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors (FIPS 201).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grother|first=Patrick|last2=Salamon|first2=Wayne|last3=Chandramouli|first3=Ramaswamy|date=July 2013|title=Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification|url=https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-76-2.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=NIST SP 800\u201376\u20132|doi=10.6028/nist.sp.800-76-2|via=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the enrollment phase, the template is simply stored somewhere (on a card or within a database or both). During the matching phase, the obtained template is passed to a matcher that compares it with other existing templates, estimating the distance between them using any algorithm (e.g. [[Hamming distance]]).

In case of feature level fusion, the data itself or the features extracted from multiple biometrics are fused. Matching-score level fusion consolidates the scores generated by multiple [[classification rule|classifiers]] pertaining to different modalities. Finally, in case of decision level fusion the final results of multiple classifiers are combined via techniques such as [[majority voting]]. Feature level fusion is believed to be more effective than the other levels of fusion because the feature set contains richer information about the input biometric data than the matching score or the output decision of a classifier. Therefore, fusion at the feature level is expected to provide better recognition results.<ref name=dca />\n\n[[Spoof attack]]s consist in submitting fake biometric traits to biometric systems, and are a major threat that can curtail their security.

It measures the percent of invalid inputs that are incorrectly accepted. In case of similarity scale, if the person is an imposter in reality, but the matching score is higher than the threshold, then he is treated as genuine. This increases the FMR, which thus also depends upon the threshold value.<ref name=Choubisa />\n* '''False non-match rate''' (FNMR, also called FRR = False Reject Rate): the probability that the system fails to detect a match between the input pattern and a matching template in the database. It measures the percent of valid inputs that are incorrectly rejected.\n* '''[[Receiver operating characteristic]]''' or relative operating characteristic (ROC): The ROC plot is a visual characterization of the trade-off between the FMR and the FNMR. In general, the matching algorithm performs a decision based on a threshold that determines how close to a template the input needs to be for it to be considered a match. If the threshold is reduced, there will be fewer false non-matches but more false accepts. Conversely, a higher threshold will reduce the FMR but increase the FNMR. A common variation is the ''Detection error trade-off (DET)'', which is obtained using normal deviation scales on both axes. This more linear graph illuminates the differences for higher performances (rarer errors).\n* '''Equal error rate''' or crossover error rate (EER or CER): the rate at which both acceptance and rejection errors are equal. The value of the EER can be easily obtained from the ROC curve. The EER is a quick way to compare the accuracy of devices with different ROC curves. In general, the device with the lowest EER is the most accurate.\n* '''Failure to enroll rate''' (FTE or FER): the rate at which attempts to create a template from an input is unsuccessful. This is most commonly caused by low-quality inputs.\n* '''Failure to capture rate''' (FTC): Within automatic systems, the probability that the system fails to detect a biometric input when presented correctly.\n* '''Template capacity''': the maximum number of sets of data that can be stored in the system.\n\n==History==\n{{further|Biostatistics}}\n\nAn early cataloguing of fingerprints dates back to 1881 when [[Juan Vucetich]] started a collection of fingerprints of criminals in Argentina.<ref>[http://onin.com/fp/fphistory.html The History of Fingerprints] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312012330/http://onin.com/fp/fphistory.html |date=12 March 2013 }}.</ref> Josh Ellenbogen and Nitzan Lebovic argued that Biometrics originated in the identification systems of criminal activity developed by [[Alphonse Bertillon]] (1853\u20131914) and by [[Francis Galton|Francis Galton's]] theory of fingerprints and physiognomy.<ref>Josh Ellenbogen, ''Reasoned and Unreasoned Images: The Photography of Bertillon, Galton, and Marey'' (University Park, PA, 2012)</ref> According to Lebovic, Galton's work \"led to the application of mathematical models to fingerprints, phrenology, and facial characteristics\", as part of \"absolute identification\" and \"a key to both inclusion and exclusion\" of populations.<ref>Nitzan Lebovic, \"Biometrics or the Power of the Radical Center\", in ''Critical Inquiry'' 41:4 (Summer, 2015), 841\u2013868.</ref> Accordingly, \"the biometric system is the absolute political weapon of our era\" and a form of \"soft control\".<ref>Nitzan Lebovic, \"Biometrics or the Power of the Radical Center\", in ''Critical Inquiry'' 41:4 (Summer, 2015), p. 853.</ref> The theoretician [[David Lyon (sociologist)|David Lyon]] showed that during the past two decades biometric systems have penetrated the civilian market, and blurred the lines between governmental forms of control and private corporate control.<ref>David Lyon, ''Surveillance Society: Monitoring Everyday Life'' (Philadelphia, 2001).</ref> Kelly A.

Rattani, \"Adaptive Biometric System based on Template Update Procedures\", PhD thesis, University of Cagliari, Italy, 2010</ref> The two-fold advantages of these systems are solving the problem of limited training data and tracking the temporal variations of the input data through adaptation. Recently, adaptive biometrics have received a significant attention from the research community. This research direction is expected to gain momentum because of their key promulgated advantages. First, with an adaptive biometric system, one no longer needs to collect a large number of biometric samples during the enrollment process. Second, it is no longer necessary to enrol again or retrain the system from scratch in order to cope with the changing environment. This convenience can significantly reduce the cost of maintaining a biometric system. Despite these advantages, there are several open issues involved with these systems. For mis-classification error (false acceptance) by the biometric system, cause adaptation using impostor sample. However, continuous research efforts are directed to resolve the open issues associated to the field of adaptive biometrics. More information about adaptive biometric systems can be found in the critical review by Rattani ''et al.''\n\n==Recent advances in emerging biometrics==\nIn recent times, biometrics based on brain ([[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]]) and heart ([[Electrocardiography|electrocardiogram]]) signals have emerged.<ref>[R.

The advantage of such 'futuristic' technology is that it is more fraud resistant compared to conventional biometrics like fingerprints. However, such technology is generally more cumbersome and still has issues such as lower accuracy and poor reproducibility over time. \nThis new generation of biometrical systems is called [https://web.archive.org/web/20170404045422/http://hir.harvard.edu/behavioral-profiling-politics-intent/ biometrics of intent] and it aims to scan ''intent''.

Humanitarian efforts are motivated by promoting the welfare of individuals in need, however the use of biometrics as a form of surveillance humanitarianism can create conflict due to varying interests of the groups involved in the particular situation. Disputes over the use of biometrics between aid programs and party officials stalls the distribution of resources to people that need help the most. In July of 2019, the United Nations World Food Program and Houthi Rebels were involved in a large dispute over the use of biometrics to ensure resources are provided to the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Yemen whose lives are threatened. The refusal to cooperate with the interests of the United Nations World Food Program resulted in the suspension of food aid to the Yemen population. The use of biometrics may provide aid programs with valuable information, however its potential solutions may not be best suited for chaotic times of crisis.

According to Agamben, biometrics turn the human persona into a bare body. Agamben refers to the two words used by Ancient Greeks for indicating \"life\", ''zoe'', which is the life common to animals and humans, just life; and ''bios'', which is life in the human context, with meanings and purposes. Agamben envisages the reduction to bare bodies for the whole humanity.<ref>Agamben G.(1998), ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life''. Trans. Daniel Heller-Roazen.

The stark expansion of biometric technologies in both the public and private sector magnifies this concern. The increasing [[commodification]] of biometrics by the private sector adds to this danger of loss of human value.

If the item is secured with a biometric device, the damage to the owner could be irreversible, and potentially cost more than the secured property. For example, in 2005, Malaysian car thieves cut off the finger of a [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] owner when attempting to steal the car.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4396831.stm|title=Malaysia car thieves steal finger|last=Kent|first=Jonathan|date=31 March 2005|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=11 December 2010|location=Kuala Lumpur|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120203534/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4396831.stm|archivedate=20 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}<br /></ref>\n\n===Presentation attacks===\nIn the context of biometric systems, presentation attacks may also be called \"spoofing attacks\".\n\nAs per the recent ISO/IEC 30107 standard,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/cms/render/live/en/sites/isoorg/contents/data/standard/05/32/53227.html|title=ISO/IEC 30107-1:2016|last=14:00-17:00|website=ISO|language=en|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> presentation attacks are defined as \"presentation to the biometric capture subsystem with the goal of interfering with the operation of the biometric system\". These attacks can be either impersonation or obfuscation attacks. Impersonation attacks try to gain access by pretending to be someone else. Obfuscation attacks may, for example, try to evade [[face detection]] and face recognition systems.\n\nRecently several methods have been proposed to counteract presentation attacks.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2014|editor-last=Marcel|editor-first=S\u00e9bastien|editor2-last=Nixon|editor2-first=Mark S.|editor3-last=Li|editor3-first=Stan Z.|title=Handbook of Biometric Anti-Spoofing|journal=Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition|doi=10.1007/978-1-4471-6524-8|issn=2191-6586|isbn=978-1-4471-6523-1}}</ref> Today's sophisticated biometric systems use \"liveness\" elements to detect spoofs (a.k.a. fake images), and some [[Electronic fingerprint recognition|fingerprint scanners]] have pulse detectors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miteksystems.com/blog/looking-ahead-7-reasons-why-biometric-security-is-important-for-digital-identity|title=Looking ahead: 7 reasons why biometric security is important for digital identity {{!}} Mitek|website=www.miteksystems.com|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> Automated detection of a presentation attack is called a \"presentation attack detection\" (PAD).\n\n===Cancelable biometrics===\nOne advantage of passwords over biometrics is that they can be re-issued. If a token or a password is lost or stolen, it can be cancelled and replaced by a newer version. This is not naturally available in biometrics. If someone's face is compromised from a database, they cannot cancel or reissue it. If the electronic biometric identifier is stolen, it is nearly impossible to change a biometric feature. This renders the person's biometric feature questionable for future use in authentication, such as the case with the hacking of security-clearance-related background information from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in the United States.\n\nCancelable biometrics is a way in which to incorporate protection and the replacement features into biometrics to create a more secure system. It was first proposed by Ratha ''et al.''<ref>N. K. Ratha, J. H. Connell, and R. M. Bolle, \"[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Connell/publication/220353130_Enhancing_Security_and_Privacy_in_Biometrics-Based_Authentication_Systems/links/555a010508ae6fd2d8281b10/Enhancing-Security-and-Privacy-in-Biometrics-Based-Authentication-Systems.pdf Enhancing security and privacy in biometrics-based authentication systems]\", ''IBM Systems Journal'', vol. 40, pp. 614\u2013634, 2001.</ref>\n\n\"Cancelable biometrics refers to the intentional and systematically repeatable distortion of biometric features in order to protect sensitive user-specific data. If a cancelable feature is compromised, the distortion characteristics are changed, and the same biometrics is mapped to a new template, which is used subsequently. Cancelable biometrics is one of the major categories for biometric template protection purpose besides biometric cryptosystem.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Cancelable biometrics \u2013 Scholarpedia|journal = Scholarpedia|volume = 5|pages = 9201|df = dmy-all|doi = 10.4249/scholarpedia.9201|year = 2010|last1 = Hui|first1 = Lim|last2 = Jin|first2 = Andrew|doi-access = free}}</ref> In biometric cryptosystem, \"the error-correcting coding techniques are employed to handle intraclass variations.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feng|first=Y.

The first fingerprint-based cancelable biometric system was designed and developed by Tulyakov ''et al.''<ref>S. Tulyakov, F. Farooq, and V. Govindaraju, \"[https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~tulyakov/papers/tulyakov_ICAPR05_fingerprint_hash.pdf Symmetric Hash Functions for Fingerprint Minutiae]\", ''Proc. Int'l Workshop Pattern Recognition for Crime Prevention, Security, and Surveillance'', pp. 30\u201338, 2005</ref> Essentially, cancelable biometrics perform a distortion of the biometric image or features before matching. The variability in the distortion parameters provides the cancelable nature of the scheme. Some of the proposed techniques operate using their own recognition engines, such as Teoh ''et al.''<ref>A. B. J. Teoh, A. Goh, and D. C. L. Ngo, \"Random Multispace Quantization as an Analytic Mechanism for BioHashing of Biometric and Random Identity Inputs\", ''IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence'', vol. 28, pp. 1892\u20131901, 2006.</ref> and Savvides ''et al.'',<ref>M. Savvides, B. V. K. V. Kumar, and P. K. Khosla, \"'Corefaces' \u2013 Robust Shift-Invariant PCA based Correlation Filter for Illumination Tolerant Face Recognition\", presented at IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'04), 2004.</ref> whereas other methods, such as Dabbah ''et al.'',<ref>M. A. Dabbah, W. L. Woo, and S. S. Dlay, \"Secure Authentication for Face Recognition\", presented at Computational Intelligence in Image and Signal Processing, 2007. CIISP 2007. IEEE Symposium on, 2007.</ref> take the advantage of the advancement of the well-established biometric research for their recognition front-end to conduct recognition. Although this increases the restrictions on the protection system, it makes the cancellable templates more accessible for available biometric technologies\n\n===Soft biometrics===\n[[Soft biometrics]] traits are physical, behavioral or adhered human characteristics that have been derived from the way human beings normally distinguish their peers (e.g. height, gender, hair color). They are used to complement the identity information provided by the primary biometric identifiers. Although soft biometric characteristics lack the distinctiveness and permanence to recognize an individual uniquely and reliably, and can be easily faked, they provide some evidence about the users identity that could be beneficial. In other words, despite the fact they are unable to individualize a subject, they are effective in distinguishing between people. Combinations of personal attributes like gender, race, eye color, height and other visible identification marks can be used to improve the performance of traditional biometric systems.<ref>Ratha, N. K., J. H. Connell, and R. M. Bolle. (2001). \"Enhancing security and privacy in biometrics based authentication systems\". ''IBM Systems Journal'' 40(3): 614\u2013634.</ref> Most soft biometrics can be easily collected and are actually collected during enrollment. Two main ethical issues are raised by soft biometrics.<ref>Mordini E, Ashton H (2012), \"The Transparent Body \u2013 Medical Information, Physical Privacy and Respect for Body Integrity'\".

Magnuson in the National Defense Magazine entitled \"Defense Department Under Pressure to Share Biometric Data\" the United States has bilateral agreements with other nations aimed at sharing biometric data.<ref name=\"DefensePressureShare\">{{Cite journal\n |last1       = Magnuson\n |first1      = S\n |title       = Defense department under pressure to share biometric data.\n |website     = NationalDefenseMagazine.org\n |date        = January 2009\n |url         = http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/ARCHIVE/2009/JANUARY/Pages/DefenseDepartmentUnderPressuretoShareBiometricData.aspx\n |accessdate  = 20 February 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100312215019/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2009/January/Pages/DefenseDepartmentUnderPressuretoShareBiometricData.aspx\n |archivedate = 12 March 2010\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> To quote that article:\n{{cquote|''Miller [a consultant to the Office of Homeland Defense and America's security affairs] said the United States has bilateral agreements to share biometric data with about 25 countries. Every time a foreign leader has visited Washington during the last few years, the State Department has made sure they sign such an agreement.''}}\n\n===Likelihood of full governmental disclosure===\nCertain members of the civilian community are worried about how biometric data is used but full disclosure may not be forthcoming. In particular, the Unclassified Report of the United States' Defense Science Board Task Force on Defense Biometrics states that it is wise to protect, and sometimes even to disguise, the true and total extent of national capabilities in areas related directly to the conduct of security-related activities.<ref name=\"OnDefenseBiometrics\">{{Citation |mode=cs1\n |last        = Defense Science Board (DSB)\n |title       = On Defense Biometrics\n |series      = Unclassified Report of the Defense Science Board Task Force\n |publisher   = Office of the Under Secretary of Defense For Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics\n |date        = March 2007\n |place       = Washington, D.C.\n |chapter-url         = http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/ADA465930.pdf\n |accessdate  = 20 February 2010\n |page        = 84\n |chapter     = Chapter 17 \u00a7Recommendation 45\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110613155549/http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/reports/ADA465930.pdf\n |archivedate = 13 June 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> This also potentially applies to Biometrics.

It refers to metrics related to human characteristics .\nBiometrics authentication (or realistic authentication) is used in computer science as a form of identification and access control. It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under surveillance.\n\nBiometric identifiers are the distinctive, measurable characteristics used to label and describe individuals. Biometric identifiers are often categorized as physiological versus behavioral characteristics. Physiological characteristics are related to the shape of the body. Examples include, but are not limited to [[fingerprint]], palm veins, [[Facial recognition system|facerecognition]], [[DNA]], palmprint, [[Hand geometry|handgeometry]], [[Iris recognition|irisrecognition]], retina and odour/scent. Behavioral characteristics are related to the pattern of behavior of a person, including but not limited to typing rhythm, gait, and [[Human voice|voice]]. Some researchers have coined the term behaviometrics to describe the latter class of [[biometrics]].\n\nMore traditional means of access control include [[Token ring|token-based identification systems]], such as a driver's [[license]] or [[passport]], and knowledge-based identification systems, such as a password or personal identification number. Since biometric identifiers are unique to individuals, they are more reliable in verifying identity than token and knowledge-based methods; however, the collection of biometric identifiers raises privacy concerns about the ultimate use of this information.\n\n==Biometric functionality==\nMany different aspects of human physiology, chemistry or behavior can be used for [[Biometrical Journal|biometric]] [[authentication]]. The selection of a particular biometric for use in a specific application involves a weighting of several factors. Jain ''et al.''

More specifically, a trait with 'good' permanence will be reasonably invariant over time with respect to the specific matching [[Algorithm|algorithm.]]\n* Measurability (collectability) relates to the ease of acquisition or measurement of the trait. In addition, acquired data should be in a form that permits subsequent processing and extraction of the relevant feature sets. \n* Performance relates to the accuracy, speed, and robustness of technology used (see [[Biometrics#Performance|performance]] section for more details). \n* Acceptability relates to how well individuals in the relevant population accept the technology such that they are willing to have their biometric trait captured and assessed. \n* Circumvention relates to the ease with which a trait might be imitated using an artifact or substitute.\n\nProper biometric use is very application dependent. Certain biometrics will be better than others based on the required levels of convenience and security.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/biometrics-comes-age|title = Biometrics comes of age: despite accuracy and security concerns, biometrics are gaining in popularity|last = Bleicher|first = Paul|date = 2005|journal = Applied Clinical Trials|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 6 December 2019}}</ref> No single biometric will meet all the requirements of every possible application.<ref name=Jain2 />\n\n[[File:Biometric system diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.5]]The block diagram illustrates the two basic modes of a biometric system.<ref name=\"Jain1\">{{Cite book|last=Jain|first=Anil K.|title=Handbook of Biometrics|last2=Ross|first2=Arun|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=978-0-387-71040-2|editor-last=Jain|editor-first=AK|pages=1\u201322|chapter=Introduction to Biometrics|editor2-last=Flynn|editor3-last=Ross|editor3-first=A|chapter-url=https://www.springer.com/computer/image+processing/book/978-1-4419-4375-0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309042959/http://www.springer.com/computer/image+processing/book/978-1-4419-4375-0|archivedate=9 March 2011|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}{{payment required}}</ref> First, in [[Authentication|verification]] (or authentication) mode the system performs a one-to-one comparison of a captured biometric with a specific template stored in a biometric database in order to verify the individual is the person they claim to be.

In the second step, some samples are matched with reference models to generate the genuine and impostor scores and calculate the threshold. The third step is the testing step. This process may use a [[smart card]], username or ID number (e.g. [[Personal identification number|PIN]]) to indicate which template should be used for comparison.<ref group=\"note\">Systems can be designed to use a template stored on media like an [[Biometric passport|e-Passport]] or [[smart card]], rather than a remote database.</ref> 'Positive recognition' is a common use of the verification mode, \"where the aim is to prevent multiple people from using the same identity\".<ref name=Jain1 />\n\nSecond, in identification mode the system performs a one-to-many comparison against a biometric database in an attempt to establish the identity of an unknown individual. The system will succeed in identifying the individual if the comparison of the biometric sample to a template in the [[database]] falls within a previously set threshold. Identification mode can be used either for 'positive recognition' (so that the user does not have to provide any information about the template to be used) or for 'negative recognition' of the person \"where the system establishes whether the person is who she (implicitly or explicitly) denies to be\".<ref name=Jain1 /> The latter function can only be achieved through biometrics since other methods of personal recognition such as [[passwords]], PINs or keys are ineffective.\n\nThe first time an individual uses a biometric system is called ''enrollment''. During enrollment, biometric information from an individual is captured and stored. In subsequent uses, biometric information is detected and compared with the information stored at the time of enrollment. Note that it is crucial that storage and retrieval of such systems themselves be secure if the biometric system is to be robust. The first block (sensor) is the interface between the real world and the system; it has to acquire all the necessary data. Most of the times it is an image acquisition system, but it can change according to the characteristics desired. The second block performs all the necessary pre-processing: it has to remove [[artifact (error)|artifact]]s from the sensor, to enhance the input (e.g. removing background noise), to use some kind of [[normalization (image processing)|normalization]], etc. In the third block, necessary features are extracted. This step is an important step as the correct features need to be extracted in an optimal way. A vector of numbers or an image with particular properties is used to create a ''template''. A template is a synthesis of the relevant characteristics extracted from the source. Elements of the biometric measurement that are not used in the comparison algorithm are discarded in the template to reduce the filesize and to protect the identity of the enrollee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ievoreader.com/how-biometric-data-is-stored/|title=How Biometric Data is Stored|date=2018-12-10|website=ievo Ltd|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> However, depending on the scope of the biometric system, original biometric image sources may be retained such as the PIV-cards used in the Federal Information Processing Standard Personal Identity Verification (PIV) of Federal Employees and Contractors (FIPS 201).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grother|first=Patrick|last2=Salamon|first2=Wayne|last3=Chandramouli|first3=Ramaswamy|date=July 2013|title=Biometric Specifications for Personal Identity Verification|url=https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-76-2.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=NIST SP 800\u201376\u20132|doi=10.6028/nist.sp.800-76-2|via=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the enrollment phase, the template is simply stored somewhere (on a card or within a database or both). During the matching phase, the obtained template is passed to a matcher that compares it with other existing templates, estimating the distance between them using any algorithm (e.g. [[Hamming distance]]). The matching program will analyze the template with the input. This will then be output for a specified use or purpose (e.g. entrance in a restricted area), though it is a fear that the use of biometric data may face mission creep<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/08/09/2018-17079/agency-information-collection-activities-biometric-identity|title=Agency Information Collection Activities: Biometric Identity|date=2018-08-09|website=Federal Register|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Center%20for%20Democracy%20%20Technology%20Comment%20DHS-2019-0001%20%28003%29.pdf|title=Re: DHS 2019-00001, DHS Data Privacy and Integrity Advisory Council|last=Taylor|first=Sandra|date=25 February 2019|website=Department of Homeland Security|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref>.\nSelection of biometrics in any practical application depending upon the characteristic measurements and user requirements.<ref name=Choubisa /> In selecting a particular biometric, factors to consider include, performance, social acceptability, ease of circumvention and/or spoofing, robustness, population coverage, size of equipment needed and [[identity theft]] deterrence.

While unimodal biometric systems are limited by the integrity of their identifier, it is unlikely that several unimodal systems will suffer from identical limitations. Multimodal biometric systems can obtain sets of information from the same marker (i.e., multiple images of an iris, or scans of the same finger) or information from different biometrics (requiring fingerprint scans and, using voice recognition, a spoken passcode).<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJqxM8sAJmIC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780306822988 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | title = This is the 'biometric war' Michael Saylor was talking about | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2013/10/this-is-the-biometric-war-michael.html | date = 3 October 2013 | work = Washington Business Journal | author = Bill Flook | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131007031912/http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2013/10/this-is-the-biometric-war-michael.html | archivedate = 7 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nMultimodal biometric systems can fuse these unimodal systems sequentially, simultaneously, a combination thereof, or in series, which refer to sequential, parallel, hierarchical and serial integration modes, respectively.\nFusion of the biometrics information can occur at different stages of a recognition system. In case of feature level fusion, the data itself or the features extracted from multiple biometrics are fused. Matching-score level fusion consolidates the scores generated by multiple [[classification rule|classifiers]] pertaining to different modalities. Finally, in case of decision level fusion the final results of multiple classifiers are combined via techniques such as [[majority voting]]. Feature level fusion is believed to be more effective than the other levels of fusion because the feature set contains richer information about the input biometric data than the matching score or the output decision of a classifier. Therefore, fusion at the feature level is expected to provide better recognition results.<ref name=dca />\n\n[[Spoof attack]]s consist in submitting fake biometric traits to biometric systems, and are a major threat that can curtail their security. Multi-modal biometric systems are commonly believed to be intrinsically more robust to spoof attacks, but recent studies<ref>Zahid Akhtar, [http://pralab.diee.unica.it/sites/default/files/Akhtar_PhD2012.pdf \"Security of Multimodal Biometric Systems against Spoof Attacks\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104529/http://pralab.diee.unica.it/sites/default/files/Akhtar_PhD2012.pdf |date=2 April 2015 }}, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy, 6 March 2012.</ref> have shown that they can be evaded by spoofing even a single biometric trait.\n\n==Performance==\nThe following are used as performance metrics for biometric systems:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccert.edu.cn/education/cissp/hism/039-041.html|title=Characteristics of Biometric Systems|publisher=Cernet|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017165633/http://www.ccert.edu.cn/education/cissp/hism/039-041.html|archivedate=17 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* '''False match rate''' (FMR, also called FAR = False Accept Rate): the probability that the system incorrectly matches the input pattern to a non-matching template in the database. It measures the percent of invalid inputs that are incorrectly accepted. In case of similarity scale, if the person is an imposter in reality, but the matching score is higher than the threshold, then he is treated as genuine. This increases the FMR, which thus also depends upon the threshold value.<ref name=Choubisa />\n* '''False non-match rate''' (FNMR, also called FRR = False Reject Rate): the probability that the system fails to detect a match between the input pattern and a matching template in the database. It measures the percent of valid inputs that are incorrectly rejected.\n* '''[[Receiver operating characteristic]]''' or relative operating characteristic (ROC): The ROC plot is a visual characterization of the trade-off between the FMR and the FNMR. In general, the matching algorithm performs a decision based on a threshold that determines how close to a template the input needs to be for it to be considered a match. If the threshold is reduced, there will be fewer false non-matches but more false accepts. Conversely, a higher threshold will reduce the FMR but increase the FNMR. A common variation is the ''Detection error trade-off (DET)'', which is obtained using normal deviation scales on both axes. This more linear graph illuminates the differences for higher performances (rarer errors).\n* '''Equal error rate''' or crossover error rate (EER or CER): the rate at which both acceptance and rejection errors are equal. The value of the EER can be easily obtained from the ROC curve. The EER is a quick way to compare the accuracy of devices with different ROC curves. In general, the device with the lowest EER is the most accurate.\n* '''Failure to enroll rate''' (FTE or FER): the rate at which attempts to create a template from an input is unsuccessful. This is most commonly caused by low-quality inputs.\n* '''Failure to capture rate''' (FTC): Within automatic systems, the probability that the system fails to detect a biometric input when presented correctly.\n* '''Template capacity''': the maximum number of sets of data that can be stored in the system.\n\n==History==\n{{further|Biostatistics}}\n\nAn early cataloguing of fingerprints dates back to 1881 when [[Juan Vucetich]] started a collection of fingerprints of criminals in Argentina.<ref>[http://onin.com/fp/fphistory.html The History of Fingerprints] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312012330/http://onin.com/fp/fphistory.html |date=12 March 2013 }}.</ref> Josh Ellenbogen and Nitzan Lebovic argued that Biometrics originated in the identification systems of criminal activity developed by [[Alphonse Bertillon]] (1853\u20131914) and by [[Francis Galton|Francis Galton's]] theory of fingerprints and physiognomy.<ref>Josh Ellenbogen, ''Reasoned and Unreasoned Images: The Photography of Bertillon, Galton, and Marey'' (University Park, PA, 2012)</ref> According to Lebovic, Galton's work \"led to the application of mathematical models to fingerprints, phrenology, and facial characteristics\", as part of \"absolute identification\" and \"a key to both inclusion and exclusion\" of populations.<ref>Nitzan Lebovic, \"Biometrics or the Power of the Radical Center\", in ''Critical Inquiry'' 41:4 (Summer, 2015), 841\u2013868.</ref> Accordingly, \"the biometric system is the absolute political weapon of our era\" and a form of \"soft control\".<ref>Nitzan Lebovic, \"Biometrics or the Power of the Radical Center\", in ''Critical Inquiry'' 41:4 (Summer, 2015), p. 853.</ref> The theoretician [[David Lyon (sociologist)|David Lyon]] showed that during the past two decades biometric systems have penetrated the civilian market, and blurred the lines between governmental forms of control and private corporate control.<ref>David Lyon, ''Surveillance Society: Monitoring Everyday Life'' (Philadelphia, 2001).</ref> Kelly A.

Rattani, \"Adaptive Biometric System based on Template Update Procedures\", PhD thesis, University of Cagliari, Italy, 2010</ref> The two-fold advantages of these systems are solving the problem of limited training data and tracking the temporal variations of the input data through adaptation. Recently, adaptive biometrics have received a significant attention from the research community. This research direction is expected to gain momentum because of their key promulgated advantages. First, with an adaptive biometric system, one no longer needs to collect a large number of biometric samples during the enrollment process. Second, it is no longer necessary to enrol again or retrain the system from scratch in order to cope with the changing environment. This convenience can significantly reduce the cost of maintaining a biometric system. Despite these advantages, there are several open issues involved with these systems. For mis-classification error (false acceptance) by the biometric system, cause adaptation using impostor sample. However, continuous research efforts are directed to resolve the open issues associated to the field of adaptive biometrics. More information about adaptive biometric systems can be found in the critical review by Rattani ''et al.''\n\n==Recent advances in emerging biometrics==\nIn recent times, biometrics based on brain ([[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]]) and heart ([[Electrocardiography|electrocardiogram]]) signals have emerged.<ref>[R.

The advantage of such 'futuristic' technology is that it is more fraud resistant compared to conventional biometrics like fingerprints. However, such technology is generally more cumbersome and still has issues such as lower accuracy and poor reproducibility over time. \nThis new generation of biometrical systems is called [https://web.archive.org/web/20170404045422/http://hir.harvard.edu/behavioral-profiling-politics-intent/ biometrics of intent] and it aims to scan ''intent''. The technology will analyze physiological features such as eye movement, body temperature, breathing etc. and predict dangerous behaviour or hostile intent before it materializes into action.\n\nOn the portability side of biometric products, more and more vendors are embracing significantly miniaturized biometric authentication systems (BAS) thereby driving elaborate cost savings, especially for large-scale deployments.\n\n===Operator signatures===\nAn operator signature is a biometric mode where the manner in which a person using a device or complex system is recorded as a verification template.<ref name=\"langston2015\" /> One potential use for this type of biometric signature is to distinguish among remote users of [[Telerobotics|telerobotic]] surgery systems that utilize public networks for communication.<ref name=\"langston2015\">{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificcomputing.com/news/2015/05/researchers-hack-teleoperated-surgical-robot-reveal-security-flaws |title=Researchers hack Teleoperated Surgical Robot to Reveal Security Flaws |author=Langston, Jennifer |date=8 May 2015 |accessdate=17 May 2015 |work=[[Scientific Computing]] |location=New Jersey |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050336/http://www.scientificcomputing.com/news/2015/05/researchers-hack-teleoperated-surgical-robot-reveal-security-flaws |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Proposed requirement for certain public networks ===\n[[John Michael McConnell|John Michael (Mike) McConnell]], a former vice admiral in the [[United States Navy]], a former Director of [[United States Director of National Intelligence|U.S. National Intelligence]], and Senior Vice President of [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] promoted the development of a future capability to require biometric authentication to access certain public networks in his keynote speech<ref name=\"McConnell-Keynote\">{{Cite conference\n |last1       = McConnell\n |first1      = Mike\n |title       = KeyNote Address\n |conference  = Biometric Consortium Conference\n |date        = January 2009\n |place       = Tampa Convention Center, Tampa, Florida\n |url         = http://www.boozallen.com/consulting-services/services_article/42861927\n |accessdate  = 20 February 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100218024851/http://www.boozallen.com/consulting-services/services_article/42861927\n |archivedate = 18 February 2010\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100212102854/http://www.biometrics.org/bc2009/ 2009 Biometric Consortium Conference].\n\nA basic premise in the above proposal is that the person that has uniquely authenticated themselves using biometrics with the computer is in fact also the agent performing potentially malicious actions from that computer.

Disputes over the use of biometrics between aid programs and party officials stalls the distribution of resources to people that need help the most. In July of 2019, the United Nations World Food Program and Houthi Rebels were involved in a large dispute over the use of biometrics to ensure resources are provided to the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Yemen whose lives are threatened. The refusal to cooperate with the interests of the United Nations World Food Program resulted in the suspension of food aid to the Yemen population. The use of biometrics may provide aid programs with valuable information, however its potential solutions may not be best suited for chaotic times of crisis. Conflicts that are caused by deep-rooted political problems, in which the implementation of biometrics may not provide a long-term solution. <ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/opinion/data-humanitarian-aid.html</ref>\n\n===Human dignity===\nBiometrics have been considered also instrumental to the development of state authority<ref>Breckenridge K.

(2008). \"No to bio-political tattooing\". ''Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies'', 5(2), 201\u2013202. Reproduced from Le Monde (10 January 2004).</ref> Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] refused to enter the United States in protest at the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator (US-VISIT) program's requirement for visitors to be fingerprinted and photographed. Agamben argued that gathering of biometric data is a form of bio-political tattooing, akin to the tattooing of Jews during the Holocaust. According to Agamben, biometrics turn the human persona into a bare body. Agamben refers to the two words used by Ancient Greeks for indicating \"life\", ''zoe'', which is the life common to animals and humans, just life; and ''bios'', which is life in the human context, with meanings and purposes. Agamben envisages the reduction to bare bodies for the whole humanity.<ref>Agamben G.(1998), ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life''. Trans. Daniel Heller-Roazen. Stanford: Stanford University Press</ref> For him, a new bio-political relationship between citizens and the state is turning citizens into pure biological life (''zoe'') depriving them from their humanity (''bios''); and biometrics would herald this new world.\n\nIn [https://www.dukeupress.edu/dark-matters Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness], [[surveillance]] scholar [[Simone Browne (sociologist)|Simone Browne]] formulates a similar critique as Agamben, citing a recent study<ref name=\"Gao 169\u2013178\">{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221383488|chapter=Face Gender Classification on Consumer Images in a Multiethnic Environment|last=Gao|first=Wei|last2=Ai|first2=Haizhou|pages=169\u2013178|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-01793-3_18|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009123149/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221383488_Face_Gender_Classification_on_Consumer_Images_in_a_Multiethnic_Environment|archivedate=9 October 2016|df=dmy-all|title=Advances in Biometrics|volume=5558|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|year=2009|isbn=978-3-642-01792-6}}</ref> relating to biometrics [[Research and development|R&D]] that found that the gender classification system being researched \"is inclined to classify Africans as males and [[Mongoloid]]s as females.\"<ref name=\"Gao 169\u2013178\"/> Consequently, Browne argues that the conception of an objective biometric technology is difficult if such systems are subjectively designed, and are vulnerable to cause errors as described in the study above. The stark expansion of biometric technologies in both the public and private sector magnifies this concern. The increasing [[commodification]] of biometrics by the private sector adds to this danger of loss of human value. Indeed, corporations value the biometric characteristics more than the individuals value them.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=25+Fordham+Intell.+Prop.+Media+%26+Ent.+L.J.+831&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=a4b55d68b2513a0c985a62bb9064501d|title = Biometric Boom: How the private sector Commodifies Human characteristics|last = Walker|first = Elizabeth|date = 2015|journal = Fordham Intellectual Property, Media & Entertainment Law Journal|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170120172630/https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay|archivedate = 20 January 2017|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Browne goes on to suggest that modern society should incorporate a \"biometric consciousness\" that \"entails informed public debate around these technologies and their application, and accountability by the state and the private sector, where the ownership of and access to one's own body data and other intellectual property that is generated from one's body data must be understood as a right.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness|last=Browne|first=Simone|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=116}}</ref>\n\nOther scholars<ref>Mordini, E; Massari, S.

Critics in the US have also signalled a conflict with the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]].\n\n===Privacy and discrimination===\n{{see|privacy|right to privacy|medical privacy}}\nIt is possible that data obtained during biometric enrollment may be used in ways for which the enrolled individual has not consented. For example, most biometric features could disclose physiological and/or pathological medical conditions (e.g., some fingerprint patterns are related to chromosomal diseases, iris patterns could reveal genetic sex, hand vein patterns could reveal vascular diseases, most behavioral biometrics could reveal neurological diseases, etc.).<ref>Mordini E, Ashton H,(2012), \"The Transparent Body \u2013 Medical Information, Physical Privacy and Respect for Body Integrity\", in Mordini E, Tzovaras D (eds), ''Second Generation Biometrics: the Ethical and Social Context''. Springer-Verlag: Berlin</ref> Moreover, second generation biometrics, notably behavioral and electro-physiologic biometrics (e.g., based on [[electrocardiography]], [[electroencephalography]], [[electromyography]]), could be also used for [[emotion detection]].<ref>Mordini E, Tzovaras D,(2012), ''Second Generation Biometrics: the Ethical and Social Context''. Springer-Verlag: Berlin</ref>\n\nThere are three categories of privacy concerns:<ref>{{cite book\n | title=Security in Computing\n | last=Pfleeger\n | first=Charles\n | author2=Pfleeger, Shari\n | publisher=Pearson Education\n | year=2007\n | location=Boston\n | page=220\n | edition=4th\n | isbn=978-0-13-239077-4\n}}</ref>\n# Unintended functional scope: The authentication goes further than authentication, such as finding a tumor.\n# Unintended application scope: The authentication process correctly identifies the subject when the subject did not wish to be identified.\n# Covert identification: The subject is identified without seeking identification or authentication, i.e. a subject's face is identified in a crowd.\n\n===Danger to owners of secured items===\nWhen thieves cannot get access to secure properties, there is a chance that the thieves will stalk and assault the property owner to gain access. If the item is secured with a biometric device, the damage to the owner could be irreversible, and potentially cost more than the secured property. For example, in 2005, Malaysian car thieves cut off the finger of a [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] owner when attempting to steal the car.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4396831.stm|title=Malaysia car thieves steal finger|last=Kent|first=Jonathan|date=31 March 2005|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=11 December 2010|location=Kuala Lumpur|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120203534/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4396831.stm|archivedate=20 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}<br /></ref>\n\n===Presentation attacks===\nIn the context of biometric systems, presentation attacks may also be called \"spoofing attacks\".\n\nAs per the recent ISO/IEC 30107 standard,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/cms/render/live/en/sites/isoorg/contents/data/standard/05/32/53227.html|title=ISO/IEC 30107-1:2016|last=14:00-17:00|website=ISO|language=en|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> presentation attacks are defined as \"presentation to the biometric capture subsystem with the goal of interfering with the operation of the biometric system\". These attacks can be either impersonation or obfuscation attacks. Impersonation attacks try to gain access by pretending to be someone else. Obfuscation attacks may, for example, try to evade [[face detection]] and face recognition systems.\n\nRecently several methods have been proposed to counteract presentation attacks.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2014|editor-last=Marcel|editor-first=S\u00e9bastien|editor2-last=Nixon|editor2-first=Mark S.|editor3-last=Li|editor3-first=Stan Z.|title=Handbook of Biometric Anti-Spoofing|journal=Advances in Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition|doi=10.1007/978-1-4471-6524-8|issn=2191-6586|isbn=978-1-4471-6523-1}}</ref> Today's sophisticated biometric systems use \"liveness\" elements to detect spoofs (a.k.a. fake images), and some [[Electronic fingerprint recognition|fingerprint scanners]] have pulse detectors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miteksystems.com/blog/looking-ahead-7-reasons-why-biometric-security-is-important-for-digital-identity|title=Looking ahead: 7 reasons why biometric security is important for digital identity {{!}} Mitek|website=www.miteksystems.com|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> Automated detection of a presentation attack is called a \"presentation attack detection\" (PAD).\n\n===Cancelable biometrics===\nOne advantage of passwords over biometrics is that they can be re-issued. If a token or a password is lost or stolen, it can be cancelled and replaced by a newer version. This is not naturally available in biometrics. If someone's face is compromised from a database, they cannot cancel or reissue it. If the electronic biometric identifier is stolen, it is nearly impossible to change a biometric feature. This renders the person's biometric feature questionable for future use in authentication, such as the case with the hacking of security-clearance-related background information from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in the United States.\n\nCancelable biometrics is a way in which to incorporate protection and the replacement features into biometrics to create a more secure system. It was first proposed by Ratha ''et al.''<ref>N. K. Ratha, J. H. Connell, and R. M. Bolle, \"[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Connell/publication/220353130_Enhancing_Security_and_Privacy_in_Biometrics-Based_Authentication_Systems/links/555a010508ae6fd2d8281b10/Enhancing-Security-and-Privacy-in-Biometrics-Based-Authentication-Systems.pdf Enhancing security and privacy in biometrics-based authentication systems]\", ''IBM Systems Journal'', vol. 40, pp. 614\u2013634, 2001.</ref>\n\n\"Cancelable biometrics refers to the intentional and systematically repeatable distortion of biometric features in order to protect sensitive user-specific data. If a cancelable feature is compromised, the distortion characteristics are changed, and the same biometrics is mapped to a new template, which is used subsequently. Cancelable biometrics is one of the major categories for biometric template protection purpose besides biometric cryptosystem.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Cancelable biometrics \u2013 Scholarpedia|journal = Scholarpedia|volume = 5|pages = 9201|df = dmy-all|doi = 10.4249/scholarpedia.9201|year = 2010|last1 = Hui|first1 = Lim|last2 = Jin|first2 = Andrew|doi-access = free}}</ref> In biometric cryptosystem, \"the error-correcting coding techniques are employed to handle intraclass variations.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feng|first=Y.

The first fingerprint-based cancelable biometric system was designed and developed by Tulyakov ''et al.''<ref>S. Tulyakov, F. Farooq, and V. Govindaraju, \"[https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~tulyakov/papers/tulyakov_ICAPR05_fingerprint_hash.pdf Symmetric Hash Functions for Fingerprint Minutiae]\", ''Proc. Int'l Workshop Pattern Recognition for Crime Prevention, Security, and Surveillance'', pp. 30\u201338, 2005</ref> Essentially, cancelable biometrics perform a distortion of the biometric image or features before matching. The variability in the distortion parameters provides the cancelable nature of the scheme. Some of the proposed techniques operate using their own recognition engines, such as Teoh ''et al.''<ref>A. B. J. Teoh, A. Goh, and D. C. L. Ngo, \"Random Multispace Quantization as an Analytic Mechanism for BioHashing of Biometric and Random Identity Inputs\", ''IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence'', vol. 28, pp. 1892\u20131901, 2006.</ref> and Savvides ''et al.'',<ref>M. Savvides, B. V. K. V. Kumar, and P. K. Khosla, \"'Corefaces' \u2013 Robust Shift-Invariant PCA based Correlation Filter for Illumination Tolerant Face Recognition\", presented at IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'04), 2004.</ref> whereas other methods, such as Dabbah ''et al.'',<ref>M. A. Dabbah, W. L. Woo, and S. S. Dlay, \"Secure Authentication for Face Recognition\", presented at Computational Intelligence in Image and Signal Processing, 2007. CIISP 2007. IEEE Symposium on, 2007.</ref> take the advantage of the advancement of the well-established biometric research for their recognition front-end to conduct recognition. Although this increases the restrictions on the protection system, it makes the cancellable templates more accessible for available biometric technologies\n\n===Soft biometrics===\n[[Soft biometrics]] traits are physical, behavioral or adhered human characteristics that have been derived from the way human beings normally distinguish their peers (e.g. height, gender, hair color). They are used to complement the identity information provided by the primary biometric identifiers. Although soft biometric characteristics lack the distinctiveness and permanence to recognize an individual uniquely and reliably, and can be easily faked, they provide some evidence about the users identity that could be beneficial. In other words, despite the fact they are unable to individualize a subject, they are effective in distinguishing between people. Combinations of personal attributes like gender, race, eye color, height and other visible identification marks can be used to improve the performance of traditional biometric systems.<ref>Ratha, N. K., J. H. Connell, and R. M. Bolle. (2001). \"Enhancing security and privacy in biometrics based authentication systems\". ''IBM Systems Journal'' 40(3): 614\u2013634.</ref> Most soft biometrics can be easily collected and are actually collected during enrollment.
