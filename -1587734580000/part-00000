Entertainment]], a division of [[AT&T]]'s [[WarnerMedia]]. The channel was launched on October 1, 1992, and primarily broadcasts [[animation|animated]] [[television show|television series]], mostly children's programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. It operates usually from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM (ET/PT) and is targeted at children between ages 7 and 15<!-- Any changes to this information must be sourced, per WP:V. -->. Its overnight [[Dayparting|daypart]] block [[Adult Swim]] is aimed at young adults and is treated as a separate entity for promotional purposes and as a separate channel by [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] for [[Audience measurement|ratings]] purposes.<ref name=\"as_split\">{{cite web|url=https://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6516.html|title=Adult Swim/CN Split Cements Strategy|date=March 3, 2005|work=ICv2|publisher=GCO|accessdate=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107105221/http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6516.html|archive-date=November 7, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[Spanish language]] audio track for select programs is accessible via [[second audio program]]ing (SAP); some TV providers offer the Spanish feed as a separate channel by removing the main English-language audio track.\n\n\nCartoon Network was not the first [[cable channel]] to have relied on cartoons to attract an audience; however, it was the first 24-hour single-genre channel with animation as its main theme. Turner Broadcasting System had defied conventional wisdom before by launching [[CNN]], a channel providing 24-hour news coverage. The concept was previously thought unlikely to attract a sufficient audience to be particularly profitable, however the CNN experiment had been successful and Turner hoped that Cartoon Network would also find success.<ref name=\"Genre\">Mittell (2004), p. 80</ref>\n\nInitially, the channel would broadcast cartoons 24 hours a day. Most of the short cartoons were aired in half-hour or hour-long packages, usually separated by character or studio&nbsp;\u2013 ''Down Wit' Droopy D'' aired old [[Droopy|Droopy Dog]] shorts, ''The [[Tom and Jerry]] Show'' presented the classic cat-and-mouse team, and ''Bugs and Daffy Tonight'' provided classic [[Looney Tunes]] shorts. ''Late Night Black and White'' showed early [[black-and-white]] cartoons (mostly from the [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons from the 1930s, as well as black-and-white Merrie Melodies and MGM cartoons), and ''[[ToonHeads]]'' would show three shorts with a similar theme and provide trivia about the cartoons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There was also an afternoon cartoon block called ''[[High Noon Toons]]'', which was hosted by cowboy hand puppets (an example of the simplicity and imagination the network had in its early years). The majority of the classic animation that was shown on Cartoon Network no longer airs on a regular basis, but ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', still aired and lasted until 2017.\n\nA challenge for Cartoon Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems. When launched on October 1, 1992, the channel was only carried by 233 cable systems. However, it benefited from [[Product bundling|package deals]]. New subscribers to sister channels [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] could also get access to Cartoon Network through such deals. The high ratings of Cartoon Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it. By the end of 1994, Cartoon Network had become \"the fifth most popular cable channel in the United States\".<ref name=\"Genre\"/>\n\nFor the first few years of Cartoon Network's existence, programming meant for the channel would also be [[simulcast]] on TBS and/or TNT, both of which were still full-service cable networks that carried a variety of different programming genera, in order to increase the shows' (and Cartoon Network's) exposure; examples include ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Cartoon Planet]]'', ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'', and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.\n\nThe network's first exclusive original show was ''[[The Moxy Show]]'', an animation anthology series first airing in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoon Network Brings Some Fresh Faces to Life|url=https://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|first=Lee|last=Winfrey|date=February 12, 1995|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170405/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|archive-date=May 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first series produced by Cartoon Network was ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' in 1994, but the show mostly consisted of \"recycled animation cells\" from the archives of Hanna-Barbera, being an ironic [[deconstruction]] of a [[talk show]]. It featured live-action guests, mostly consisting of celebrities which were past their prime or [[counterculture]] figures. A running gag was that the production cost was dubbed \"minimal\". The series found its audience among young adults who appreciated its \"[[Hip (slang)|hip]]\" perspective.<ref name=\"Genre4\">Mittell (2004), p. 82-83</ref>\n\nKevin Sandler considered ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' instrumental in establishing Cartoon Network's appeal to older audiences. [[Space Ghost]], a 1960s [[superhero]] by Hanna-Barbera, was recast as the star of a [[talk show]] spoof. This was arguably the first time the network revived a \"classic animated icon\" in an entirely new context for comedic purposes. Grown-ups who had ceased enjoying the original takes on the characters could find amusement in the \"new ironic and self-referential context\" for them. Promotional shorts such as the \"Scooby-Doo Project\", a parody of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', gave similar treatments to the Scooby gang.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98-99</ref> However, there were less successful efforts at such revivals. ''[[A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith]]'' and ''[[Boo Boo Runs Wild]]'' (1999) were short cartoons featuring new takes on [[Yogi Bear]]'s supporting cast by [[John Kricfalusi]]. Their style of humor, sexual content and break in tone from the source material was rather out of place among the rest of the Cartoon Network shows, and the network rarely found a place for them in its programming.<ref name=\"Prime Time3\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 100</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Hanna-Barbera's new division [[Cartoon Network Studios]] was founded and started production on ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' (also known as ''World Premiere Toons'' and ''Cartoon Cartoons''). This show debuted in 1995, offering original animated shorts commissioned from Hanna-Barbera and various independent animators. The network promoted the series as an attempt to return to the \"classic days\" of studio animation, offering full animator control, high budgets, and no [[limited animation]]. The project was spearheaded by Cartoon Network executives, plus [[John Kricfalusi]] and [[Fred Seibert]]. Kricfalusi was the creator of  ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' and served as an advisor to the network, while Seibert was formerly one of the driving forces behind Nickelodeon's [[Nicktoons]] and would go on to produce the similar animation anthology series ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' and ''[[Random!

That show was called ''[[Sunday Pants]]''; it first aired on the day of October 2, 2005. ''Sunday Pants'' varies on different types of animation, from traditional hand-drawn animation to Flash, or even CGI, possibly making it similar to other shows such as ''[[Liquid Television]]'' on [[MTV]] or ''[[KaBlam!]]'' on [[Nickelodeon]]. The show was created by Craig \"Sven\" Gordon and Stuart Hill, and was produced at Spitfire Studios. The show has a similar concept to ''What a Cartoon!'', except that the shorts are 1\u20133 minutes long and the show is squeezed to be 23 minutes (without commercials). There are animated and live-action intervals in-between shorts. The live-action ones are performed by American band The Slacks, while the animated ones are animated by WeFail. The show lasted for less than a month, with its final airing taking place on October 23, 2005. In January 2006, the show was announced to be returning the month after but said return never came to fruition and the series was ultimately cancelled.\n\nTwo new Cartoon Network original series premiered in 2006: ''[[Squirrel Boy]]'' and ''[[Class of 3000]]''.

(TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', ''[[Power Players]]'', ''[[Total DramaRama]]'', ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' and ''[[Unikitty!]]''. In the past, Cartoon Network has also produced live-action programming, such as the live-action/animated hybrids ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'' and ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'', and shows such as ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'', ''[[Tower Prep]],'' and ''[[Incredible Crew]]''.\n\nIn addition, Cartoon Network reruns various ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, which have been in constant rotation from the network's launch in 1992 until 2017.

'''Cartoon Cartoons''' was once the branding for Cartoon Network's original [[animation|animated]] [[television show|television series]], but it has seldom been used by the network by 2003. The name was eventually discontinued in 2008.\n\n===Programming blocks===\nBy the early 2000s, Cartoon Network had established programming blocks aimed at different age demographics. The shows broadcast during the early morning had [[preschool]]ers as their target audience and mostly had [[prosocial behavior]] as a theme. The [[Toonami]] programming block, featured later in the day, mostly included anime shows and its target audience was [[preadolescence|tweens]] and [[Adolescence|teenagers]]. [[Prime time]] shows mostly included classic cartoons, featured as part of ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[The Chuck Jones Show]]'' and ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]''. Preschool programming was discontinued by 2007.\n\n===Current programming blocks===\n'''''[[Adult Swim]]''''' \u2013 A night time program block aimed at young adults, which airs content that is not suitable for children. It does not feature any advertising for Cartoon Network programming and, due to its long runtime and different demographics, is branded as a separate channel. Adult Swim airs a mix of live-action and animated comedies, including both original series such as ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', as well as acquired programming like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] shows and Japanese [[anime]], aired under the [[Toonami]] branding since May 2012, every Saturday night. Adult Swim is currently  broadcast daily from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adultswim.com/schedule|title=On-Air Schedule - Adult Swim|website=www.adultswim.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103072509/https://www.adultswim.com/schedule/|archive-date=November 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> ET/PT; its starting time has changed various times, from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. and to 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==Marketing==\nCartoon Network shows with established fan followings, such as ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', allowed the network to pursue licensing agreements with companies interested in selling series-related merchandise. For example, agreements with [[Kraft Foods]] led to widespread in-store advertising for Cartoon Network-related products. The network also worked on cross-promotion campaigns with both Kraft and [[Tower Records]]. In product development and marketing, the network has benefited from its relation to corporate parent [[Time Warner]], allowing for mutually beneficial relationships with various subsidiary companies.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 101-102</ref>\n\n[[Time Warner Cable]], the former cable television subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2009), distributes Cartoon Network as part of its packages. [[Turner Broadcasting System]], the subsidiary overseeing various Time Warner-owned networks, helped cross-promote Cartoon Network shows and at times arranged for swapping certain shows between the networks. For example, ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'', one of CN's original shows, was at times seen at [[Kids' WB]] (which was discontinued on May 24, 2008), while ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' and ''[[\u00a1Mucha Lucha!]]'',two of Kids' WB!'s original shows, were seen at Cartoon Network. In each case, the swap intended to cultivate a shared audience for the two networks. [[Time Inc.]], the former subsidiary overseeing the magazines of the corporate parent, ensured favorable coverage of Cartoon Network and advertising space across its publications. Printed advertisements for CN shows could appear in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids]]'' until Time Inc. was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner on June 9, 2014. [[AOL]], a now-former sibling company to Time Warner covering Internet services, helped promote Cartoon Network shows online by offering exclusive content for certain animated series, online [[sweepstakes]] and [[display advertising]] for CN.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n[[Warner Home Video]], the home video subsidiary, distributed VHS tapes, DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s featuring Cartoon Network shows. Select [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] VHS releases came with bonus cartoons from Cartoon Network. [[Rhino Entertainment]], the former record label subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2004), distributed cassette tapes and CDs with Cartoon Network-related music. These products were also available through the [[Warner Bros. Studio Store]]. [[DC Comics]], the comic book subsidiary, published a series featuring the Powerpuff Girls, indicating it could handle other CN-related characters. [[Warner Bros.]], the film studio subsidiary, released ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'' in 2002. Kevin Sandler considered it likely that this film would find its way to [[HBO]] or [[Cinemax]], two television network subsidiaries which regularly broadcast feature films. Sandler also viewed book [[tie-in]]s through [[Warner Books]] as likely, since it was the only area of marketing not covered yet by 2001.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n==Editing of ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts==\nCartoon Network has, during its history, broadcast most of the [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography|Warner Bros. animated shorts]] originally created between the 1920s and the 1960s, but the network edited out scenes depicting discharge of gunfire, alcohol ingestion, cowboys and Indians gags, tobacco, and politically incorrect humor. The unedited versions were kept from both broadcasting and wide release on the video market. ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' (1943), a politically incorrect but critically well-regarded short, was notably omitted entirely, while ''[[The Scarlet Pumpernickel]]'' (1950) and ''[[Feed the Kitty]]'' (1952), both well-regarded, had their finales heavily edited due to violence.<ref name=\"Prime Time6\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 105-107</ref>\n\nThere was media attention in June 2001 over a network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting. Cartoon Network formerly scheduled a 49-hour-long marathon annually known as ''June Bugs'', promising to broadcast every [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny animated short]] in chronological order. The network originally intended to include 12 shorts for its 2001 airing of the marathon (one of them part of the [[Censored Eleven]] list of ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons effectively shelved from distribution) that had become controversial for using [[ethnic and national stereotypes]], albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure few children were watching, with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time. The network's corporate parent considered it likely that there would be complaints concerning racial insensitivity. This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety. Laurie Goldberg, vice-president of public relations, defended the decision, stating, \"We're the leader in animation, but we're also one of the top-rated general entertainment networks. There are certain responsibilities that come with that\".<ref name=\"Prime Time6\"/>\n\n==Related projects==\n\n===Adult Swim===\n{{Main|Adult Swim}}\n\nAdult Swim (often stylized as [adult swim] or [as]) is a teen/adult-oriented nighttime programming service that airs on Cartoon Network from usually 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM [[Eastern time|ET]]/[[Pacific time|PT]] everyday in the United States, and broadcasts in countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; Adult Swim is treated by [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] as a separate network in its ratings reports (similar to the company's ratings treatment of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick at Nite]] and the now-defunct [[Nickmom]]) due to differing target demographics between it and Cartoon Network.<ref name=\"as_split\"/> The network features myriad stylistically variable animated and live-action shows, including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows mainly consisting of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated programming, and Japanese [[anime]], generally with minimal or no editing for content. The programs featured on Adult Swim are geared toward a mature audience, in contrast to the originally all-ages young teen and preteen daytime programming on Cartoon Network. Adult Swim moved its start time up an hour at 8pm on March 31, 2014. The 8pm hour was given back to Cartoon Network on numerous occasions, however, which used it to premiere ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Adventure Time: Stakes]]'' in 2015, new episodes of the [[Regular Show (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[Regular Show]]'' in 2016, new episodes of the [[The Amazing World of Gumball (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/11/20/steven-universe-future-official-trailer |title=Steven Universe Future Releases First Official Trailer |work=ComicBook.com |first=Rollin |last=Bishop |date=November 20, 2019 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Toonami===\n{{Main|Toonami}}\nToonami (a portmanteau of \"cartoon\" and \"[[tsunami]]\", suggesting a \"tidal wave\" of animated cartoons) is a brand of Cartoon Network, used initially for action-oriented programming blocks on Cartoon Network television channels worldwide, mostly showing American cartoons and Japanese anime, originating in the United States on March 17, 1997, and ending on September 20, 2008. It was revived on May 26, 2012, as a Saturday night anime block on Adult Swim, reclaiming their Saturday anime lineup, similar to its previous mature-geared \"Midnight Run\" incarnation which was that block's forerunner. The host was a muscular teenage robot named TOM, voiced by [[Steven Blum]].\n\nThe Toonami brand was subsequently used in the United Kingdom as the name of an action-oriented animation channel with two CGI hosts. It replaced a former Cartoon Network-owned channel, CNX, which had been a Toonami/live-action hybrid network.\n\nToonami was launched as a 24-hour channel in [[Toonami (Southeast Asia)|Asia]] in December 2012, in [[Toonami (India)|India]] in February 2015 and in [[Toonami (France)|France]] in February 2016. \"It really is the ultimate home of the action hero,\" said Sunny Saha from Turner International.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|title=Indian Television Dot Com&nbsp;\u2014 Toonami to launch in Hong Kong on 1 December|author=Anil Wanvari|work=indiantelevision.com|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701085333/http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|archive-date=July 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Boomerang===\n{{Main|Boomerang (TV network)}}\nBoomerang began as a programming block on Cartoon Network on December 8, 1992, and continued until October 2004, aimed towards the [[Baby boomer|Baby Boom]] generation. The block's start time changed frequently but was always aired in the weekends. On April 1, 2000, Boomerang received a new look and was spun off into its own cable channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/01/entertainment/ca-14752|title=Hanna-Barbera Cartoons Return on New Boomerang|first=Susan|last=King|date=April 1, 2000|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=August 31, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128082219/http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/01/entertainment/ca-14752|archive-date=November 28, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2017, an online Boomerang video-on-demand service was launched.

The network's HD content airs with letterboxing on the standard definition channel, and since May 13, 2013, the high definition feed is downscaled by the provider for the standard definition feed, resulting in all programming appearing in a 16:9 ratio with letterboxing. Unlike the other Turner networks, standard definition advertising is also stretched into 16:9 mode.\n\n===Cartoon Network Studios===\n{{Main|Cartoon Network Studios}}\n'''Cartoon Network Studios''' is a production studio located in the network's West Coast headquarters of [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[California]], which serves as the network's first animation studio division to provide original programs for the network.

By the time that the network debuted, Cartoon Network also operated a programming block (containing its cartoons) that aired on TCM, entitled \"Cartoon Network on TCM\".\n\nCartoon Network was not the first [[cable channel]] to have relied on cartoons to attract an audience; however, it was the first 24-hour single-genre channel with animation as its main theme. Turner Broadcasting System had defied conventional wisdom before by launching [[CNN]], a channel providing 24-hour news coverage. The concept was previously thought unlikely to attract a sufficient audience to be particularly profitable, however the CNN experiment had been successful and Turner hoped that Cartoon Network would also find success.<ref name=\"Genre\">Mittell (2004), p. 80</ref>\n\nInitially, the channel would broadcast cartoons 24 hours a day. Most of the short cartoons were aired in half-hour or hour-long packages, usually separated by character or studio&nbsp;\u2013 ''Down Wit' Droopy D'' aired old [[Droopy|Droopy Dog]] shorts, ''The [[Tom and Jerry]] Show'' presented the classic cat-and-mouse team, and ''Bugs and Daffy Tonight'' provided classic [[Looney Tunes]] shorts. ''Late Night Black and White'' showed early [[black-and-white]] cartoons (mostly from the [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons from the 1930s, as well as black-and-white Merrie Melodies and MGM cartoons), and ''[[ToonHeads]]'' would show three shorts with a similar theme and provide trivia about the cartoons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There was also an afternoon cartoon block called ''[[High Noon Toons]]'', which was hosted by cowboy hand puppets (an example of the simplicity and imagination the network had in its early years). The majority of the classic animation that was shown on Cartoon Network no longer airs on a regular basis, but ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', still aired and lasted until 2017.\n\nA challenge for Cartoon Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems. When launched on October 1, 1992, the channel was only carried by 233 cable systems. However, it benefited from [[Product bundling|package deals]]. New subscribers to sister channels [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] could also get access to Cartoon Network through such deals. The high ratings of Cartoon Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it. By the end of 1994, Cartoon Network had become \"the fifth most popular cable channel in the United States\".<ref name=\"Genre\"/>\n\nFor the first few years of Cartoon Network's existence, programming meant for the channel would also be [[simulcast]] on TBS and/or TNT, both of which were still full-service cable networks that carried a variety of different programming genera, in order to increase the shows' (and Cartoon Network's) exposure; examples include ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Cartoon Planet]]'', ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'', and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.\n\nThe network's first exclusive original show was ''[[The Moxy Show]]'', an animation anthology series first airing in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoon Network Brings Some Fresh Faces to Life|url=https://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|first=Lee|last=Winfrey|date=February 12, 1995|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170405/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|archive-date=May 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first series produced by Cartoon Network was ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' in 1994, but the show mostly consisted of \"recycled animation cells\" from the archives of Hanna-Barbera, being an ironic [[deconstruction]] of a [[talk show]]. It featured live-action guests, mostly consisting of celebrities which were past their prime or [[counterculture]] figures. A running gag was that the production cost was dubbed \"minimal\". The series found its audience among young adults who appreciated its \"[[Hip (slang)|hip]]\" perspective.<ref name=\"Genre4\">Mittell (2004), p. 82-83</ref>\n\nKevin Sandler considered ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' instrumental in establishing Cartoon Network's appeal to older audiences. [[Space Ghost]], a 1960s [[superhero]] by Hanna-Barbera, was recast as the star of a [[talk show]] spoof. This was arguably the first time the network revived a \"classic animated icon\" in an entirely new context for comedic purposes. Grown-ups who had ceased enjoying the original takes on the characters could find amusement in the \"new ironic and self-referential context\" for them. Promotional shorts such as the \"Scooby-Doo Project\", a parody of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', gave similar treatments to the Scooby gang.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98-99</ref> However, there were less successful efforts at such revivals. ''[[A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith]]'' and ''[[Boo Boo Runs Wild]]'' (1999) were short cartoons featuring new takes on [[Yogi Bear]]'s supporting cast by [[John Kricfalusi]]. Their style of humor, sexual content and break in tone from the source material was rather out of place among the rest of the Cartoon Network shows, and the network rarely found a place for them in its programming.<ref name=\"Prime Time3\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 100</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Hanna-Barbera's new division [[Cartoon Network Studios]] was founded and started production on ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' (also known as ''World Premiere Toons'' and ''Cartoon Cartoons''). This show debuted in 1995, offering original animated shorts commissioned from Hanna-Barbera and various independent animators. The network promoted the series as an attempt to return to the \"classic days\" of studio animation, offering full animator control, high budgets, and no [[limited animation]]. The project was spearheaded by Cartoon Network executives, plus [[John Kricfalusi]] and [[Fred Seibert]]. Kricfalusi was the creator of  ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' and served as an advisor to the network, while Seibert was formerly one of the driving forces behind Nickelodeon's [[Nicktoons]] and would go on to produce the similar animation anthology series ''[[Oh Yeah!

Three more series based on shorts debuted from 1997 to 1999: ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'' (the latter two as segments of the same show; ''I Am Weasel'' was later spun off into a separate show), ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'', and ''[[Mike, Lu & Og]]''.<ref name=\"Genre4\"/><ref name=\"Seibert\"/><ref name=\"Mike, Lu And Og\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/95956-Mike_Lu_And_Og.html|title=Mike, Lu And Og (1996)&nbsp;\u2013 What A Cartoon!

[[Linda Simensky]], vice president of original animation, reminded adults and teenage girls that cartoons could appeal to them as well. Kevin Sandler's article of them claimed that these cartoons were both less \"[[Ribaldry|bawdy]]\" than their counterparts at [[Comedy Central]] and less \"[[Social responsibility|socially responsible]]\" than their counterparts at [[Nickelodeon]]. Sandler pointed to the whimsical rebelliousness, high rate of exaggeration and self-consciousness of the overall output each individual series managed.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\"/>\n\nIn 1995, Cartoon Network launched \"Cartoon Network Online\" as an [[AOL|America Online]] exclusive website. It would later merge with ghostplanet.com as simply \"CartoonNetwork.com\", and featured games, videos, shopping, [[Cartoon Orbit]], which launched in 2000, and even promotions to movies, video games, food items, toys, etc., such as [[Campbell's Soup]], ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', the original ''[[Spy Kids]]'' trilogy, ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|the Cat in the Hat]]'', [[Juicy Drop Pop]], [[Wonder Ball]], ''[[Hot Wheels]]'', and so many more. In addition, CartoonNetwork.com also ran Cartoon Network's first online original series ''Web Premiere Toons'', which mostly featured interactive web cartoons that ran from 1999 to 2002.\n\nIn 1996, Cartoon Network decided to air preschool programming and air them every Sunday morning, such as hiring [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the makers of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on [[PBS Kids]], to make a show called ''[[Big Bag]]'', a live-action/puppet television program targeted at pre-school viewers, as well as ''[[Small World (U.S. TV series)|Small World]]'', a children's animated anthology show and variety show, in which showcased featured several segments from animated TV programs aimed at preschoolers from several countries around the world except for Japan, China, and Korea. ''Big Bag'' ran until 1998, and ''Small World'' ran until 2001.\n\nIn 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with [[Time Warner]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Turner To Merge Into Time Warner; A $7.5 Billion Deal|first=Mark|last=Lander|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|date=September 23, 1995|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513030130/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|archive-date=May 13, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> (ironically, Time Warner's predecessor [[Warner Communications]] had created rival [[Nickelodeon]], now owned by [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], in 1977).

That show was called ''[[Sunday Pants]]''; it first aired on the day of October 2, 2005. ''Sunday Pants'' varies on different types of animation, from traditional hand-drawn animation to Flash, or even CGI, possibly making it similar to other shows such as ''[[Liquid Television]]'' on [[MTV]] or ''[[KaBlam!]]'' on [[Nickelodeon]]. The show was created by Craig \"Sven\" Gordon and Stuart Hill, and was produced at Spitfire Studios. The show has a similar concept to ''What a Cartoon!'', except that the shorts are 1\u20133 minutes long and the show is squeezed to be 23 minutes (without commercials). There are animated and live-action intervals in-between shorts. The live-action ones are performed by American band The Slacks, while the animated ones are animated by WeFail. The show lasted for less than a month, with its final airing taking place on October 23, 2005. In January 2006, the show was announced to be returning the month after but said return never came to fruition and the series was ultimately cancelled.\n\nTwo new Cartoon Network original series premiered in 2006: ''[[Squirrel Boy]]'' and ''[[Class of 3000]]''.

(TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', ''[[Power Players]]'', ''[[Total DramaRama]]'', ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' and ''[[Unikitty!]]''. In the past, Cartoon Network has also produced live-action programming, such as the live-action/animated hybrids ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'' and ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'', and shows such as ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'', ''[[Tower Prep]],'' and ''[[Incredible Crew]]''.\n\nIn addition, Cartoon Network reruns various ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, which have been in constant rotation from the network's launch in 1992 until 2017. In its early days, Cartoon Network benefited from having access to a large collection of animated programming, including the libraries of [[Warner Bros.]] (''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and other series), and [[Hanna-Barbera]] (''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', and others). Turner's ownership of Hanna-Barbera gave the network access to an established animation studio, something chief rival Nickelodeon did not yet have.<ref name=\"Prime Time\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98</ref> Most of these series were removed by 1999 and moved to Boomerang in 2000.\n\n===Original series===\n{{see also|Cartoon Cartoons}}\nMuch of Cartoon Network's original programming originates from the network's in-house studio, [[Cartoon Network Studios]]. Beginning as a division of [[Hanna-Barbera]], this studio would produce some of the network's earliest original series, including ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. '''Cartoon Cartoons''' was once the branding for Cartoon Network's original [[animation|animated]] [[television show|television series]], but it has seldom been used by the network by 2003. The name was eventually discontinued in 2008.\n\n===Programming blocks===\nBy the early 2000s, Cartoon Network had established programming blocks aimed at different age demographics. The shows broadcast during the early morning had [[preschool]]ers as their target audience and mostly had [[prosocial behavior]] as a theme. The [[Toonami]] programming block, featured later in the day, mostly included anime shows and its target audience was [[preadolescence|tweens]] and [[Adolescence|teenagers]]. [[Prime time]] shows mostly included classic cartoons, featured as part of ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[The Chuck Jones Show]]'' and ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]''. Preschool programming was discontinued by 2007.\n\n===Current programming blocks===\n'''''[[Adult Swim]]''''' \u2013 A night time program block aimed at young adults, which airs content that is not suitable for children. It does not feature any advertising for Cartoon Network programming and, due to its long runtime and different demographics, is branded as a separate channel. Adult Swim airs a mix of live-action and animated comedies, including both original series such as ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', as well as acquired programming like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] shows and Japanese [[anime]], aired under the [[Toonami]] branding since May 2012, every Saturday night. Adult Swim is currently  broadcast daily from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adultswim.com/schedule|title=On-Air Schedule - Adult Swim|website=www.adultswim.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103072509/https://www.adultswim.com/schedule/|archive-date=November 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> ET/PT; its starting time has changed various times, from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. and to 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==Marketing==\nCartoon Network shows with established fan followings, such as ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', allowed the network to pursue licensing agreements with companies interested in selling series-related merchandise. For example, agreements with [[Kraft Foods]] led to widespread in-store advertising for Cartoon Network-related products. The network also worked on cross-promotion campaigns with both Kraft and [[Tower Records]]. In product development and marketing, the network has benefited from its relation to corporate parent [[Time Warner]], allowing for mutually beneficial relationships with various subsidiary companies.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 101-102</ref>\n\n[[Time Warner Cable]], the former cable television subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2009), distributes Cartoon Network as part of its packages. [[Turner Broadcasting System]], the subsidiary overseeing various Time Warner-owned networks, helped cross-promote Cartoon Network shows and at times arranged for swapping certain shows between the networks. For example, ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'', one of CN's original shows, was at times seen at [[Kids' WB]] (which was discontinued on May 24, 2008), while ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' and ''[[\u00a1Mucha Lucha!]]'',two of Kids' WB!'s original shows, were seen at Cartoon Network. In each case, the swap intended to cultivate a shared audience for the two networks. [[Time Inc.]], the former subsidiary overseeing the magazines of the corporate parent, ensured favorable coverage of Cartoon Network and advertising space across its publications. Printed advertisements for CN shows could appear in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids]]'' until Time Inc. was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner on June 9, 2014. [[AOL]], a now-former sibling company to Time Warner covering Internet services, helped promote Cartoon Network shows online by offering exclusive content for certain animated series, online [[sweepstakes]] and [[display advertising]] for CN.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n[[Warner Home Video]], the home video subsidiary, distributed VHS tapes, DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s featuring Cartoon Network shows. Select [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] VHS releases came with bonus cartoons from Cartoon Network. [[Rhino Entertainment]], the former record label subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2004), distributed cassette tapes and CDs with Cartoon Network-related music. These products were also available through the [[Warner Bros. Studio Store]]. [[DC Comics]], the comic book subsidiary, published a series featuring the Powerpuff Girls, indicating it could handle other CN-related characters. [[Warner Bros.]], the film studio subsidiary, released ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'' in 2002. Kevin Sandler considered it likely that this film would find its way to [[HBO]] or [[Cinemax]], two television network subsidiaries which regularly broadcast feature films. Sandler also viewed book [[tie-in]]s through [[Warner Books]] as likely, since it was the only area of marketing not covered yet by 2001.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n==Editing of ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts==\nCartoon Network has, during its history, broadcast most of the [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography|Warner Bros. animated shorts]] originally created between the 1920s and the 1960s, but the network edited out scenes depicting discharge of gunfire, alcohol ingestion, cowboys and Indians gags, tobacco, and politically incorrect humor. The unedited versions were kept from both broadcasting and wide release on the video market. ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' (1943), a politically incorrect but critically well-regarded short, was notably omitted entirely, while ''[[The Scarlet Pumpernickel]]'' (1950) and ''[[Feed the Kitty]]'' (1952), both well-regarded, had their finales heavily edited due to violence.<ref name=\"Prime Time6\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 105-107</ref>\n\nThere was media attention in June 2001 over a network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting. Cartoon Network formerly scheduled a 49-hour-long marathon annually known as ''June Bugs'', promising to broadcast every [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny animated short]] in chronological order. The network originally intended to include 12 shorts for its 2001 airing of the marathon (one of them part of the [[Censored Eleven]] list of ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons effectively shelved from distribution) that had become controversial for using [[ethnic and national stereotypes]], albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure few children were watching, with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time. The network's corporate parent considered it likely that there would be complaints concerning racial insensitivity. This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety. Laurie Goldberg, vice-president of public relations, defended the decision, stating, \"We're the leader in animation, but we're also one of the top-rated general entertainment networks. There are certain responsibilities that come with that\".<ref name=\"Prime Time6\"/>\n\n==Related projects==\n\n===Adult Swim===\n{{Main|Adult Swim}}\n\nAdult Swim (often stylized as [adult swim] or [as]) is a teen/adult-oriented nighttime programming service that airs on Cartoon Network from usually 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM [[Eastern time|ET]]/[[Pacific time|PT]] everyday in the United States, and broadcasts in countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; Adult Swim is treated by [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] as a separate network in its ratings reports (similar to the company's ratings treatment of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick at Nite]] and the now-defunct [[Nickmom]]) due to differing target demographics between it and Cartoon Network.<ref name=\"as_split\"/> The network features myriad stylistically variable animated and live-action shows, including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows mainly consisting of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated programming, and Japanese [[anime]], generally with minimal or no editing for content. The programs featured on Adult Swim are geared toward a mature audience, in contrast to the originally all-ages young teen and preteen daytime programming on Cartoon Network. Adult Swim moved its start time up an hour at 8pm on March 31, 2014. The 8pm hour was given back to Cartoon Network on numerous occasions, however, which used it to premiere ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Adventure Time: Stakes]]'' in 2015, new episodes of the [[Regular Show (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[Regular Show]]'' in 2016, new episodes of the [[The Amazing World of Gumball (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/11/20/steven-universe-future-official-trailer |title=Steven Universe Future Releases First Official Trailer |work=ComicBook.com |first=Rollin |last=Bishop |date=November 20, 2019 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Toonami===\n{{Main|Toonami}}\nToonami (a portmanteau of \"cartoon\" and \"[[tsunami]]\", suggesting a \"tidal wave\" of animated cartoons) is a brand of Cartoon Network, used initially for action-oriented programming blocks on Cartoon Network television channels worldwide, mostly showing American cartoons and Japanese anime, originating in the United States on March 17, 1997, and ending on September 20, 2008. It was revived on May 26, 2012, as a Saturday night anime block on Adult Swim, reclaiming their Saturday anime lineup, similar to its previous mature-geared \"Midnight Run\" incarnation which was that block's forerunner. The host was a muscular teenage robot named TOM, voiced by [[Steven Blum]].\n\nThe Toonami brand was subsequently used in the United Kingdom as the name of an action-oriented animation channel with two CGI hosts. It replaced a former Cartoon Network-owned channel, CNX, which had been a Toonami/live-action hybrid network.\n\nToonami was launched as a 24-hour channel in [[Toonami (Southeast Asia)|Asia]] in December 2012, in [[Toonami (India)|India]] in February 2015 and in [[Toonami (France)|France]] in February 2016. \"It really is the ultimate home of the action hero,\" said Sunny Saha from Turner International.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|title=Indian Television Dot Com&nbsp;\u2014 Toonami to launch in Hong Kong on 1 December|author=Anil Wanvari|work=indiantelevision.com|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701085333/http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|archive-date=July 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Boomerang===\n{{Main|Boomerang (TV network)}}\nBoomerang began as a programming block on Cartoon Network on December 8, 1992, and continued until October 2004, aimed towards the [[Baby boomer|Baby Boom]] generation.

All three dynasties claimed descent from [[Narakasura]].\n\nIn the reign of the Varman king, [[Bhaskaravarman]] (c. 600\u2013650 AD), the Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] visited the [[Kamrup region|region]] and recorded his travels. Later, after weakening and disintegration (after the Kamarupa-Palas), the Kamarupa tradition was extended to c. 1255 AD by the Lunar I (c. 1120\u20131185 AD) and Lunar II (c. 1155\u20131255 AD) dynasties.<ref name=\"HKBarpujariCHOA\" />\n\n=== Medieval era ===\n{{further|Kamata kingdom|Koch dynasty|Ahom kingdom|Chutiya kingdom|Kachari kingdom|Baro-Bhuyan}}\nThe Ahoms, a [[Tai peoples|Tai]] group, ruled [[Upper Assam]]<ref>Banikanta Kakati, ''Assamese:Its formation and development''</ref> The Shans built their kingdom and consolidated their power in Eastern Assam with the modern town of [[Sibsagar]] as their capital. Until the early 1500s, the Ahoms ruled a small kingdom in [[Sibsagar district]] and suddenly expanded during King Suhungmung's rule taking advantage of weakening rule of Chutia and Dimasa kingdoms. By 1681, the whole track down to the border of the modern district of Goalpara came permanently under their sway. Ahoms ruled for nearly 600 years (1228\u20131826 AD) with major expansions in the early 16th century at the cost of [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutia]] and [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa Kachari]] kingdoms. Since c. the 13th century AD, the nerve centre of Ahom polity was upper Assam; the kingdom was gradually extended to the [[Karatoya River]] in the 17th or 18th century. It was at its zenith during the reign of [[Sukhrungphaa]] or Sworgodeu Rudra Sinha (c. 1696\u20131714 AD).\n\nThe Chutiya rulers (1187\u20131673 AD), a [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] group by origin, held the regions on both the banks of Brahmaputra with its domain in the area eastwards from [[Biswanath Chariali|Vishwanath]] (north bank) and [[Dihing River|Buridihing]] (south bank), in [[Upper Assam]] and in the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. It was partially annexed in the early 1500s by the Ahoms, finally getting absorbed in 1673 AD. The rivalry between the Chutiyas and Ahoms for the supremacy of eastern Assam led to a series of battles between them from the early 16th century until the start of the 17th century, which saw great loss of men and money.\n\nThe Koch, another [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] dynasty, established sovereignty in c. 1510 AD. The Koch kingdom in Western Assam and present-day [[North Bengal]] was at its zenith in the early reign of [[Nara Narayan]] (c. 1540\u20131587 AD). It split into two in c. 1581 CE, the western part as a [[Moghul]] vassal and the eastern as an Ahom satellite state. Later, in 1682, [[Koch Hajo]] was entirely annexed by the Ahoms.\n\nAmong other dynasties, the [[Kachari Kingdom|Dimasa]], another [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] dynasty, (13th century-1854 AD) ruled from Dikhow River to central and southern Assam and had their capital at [[Dimapur]]. With the expansion of Ahom kingdom, by the early 17th century, the Chutiya areas were annexed and since c. 1536 AD the Kacharis remained only in [[Cachar]] and [[North Cachar]], and more as an Ahom ally than a competing force.\n\nDespite numerous invasions, mostly by the Muslim rulers, no western power ruled Assam until the arrival of the British. Though the [[Mughal empire|Mughals]] made seventeen attempts to invade, they were never successful. The most successful invader [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]], a governor of [[Aurangzeb]], briefly occupied [[Garhgaon]] (c. 1662\u201363 AD), the then capital, but found it difficult to prevent [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] attacks on his forces, forcing them to leave. The decisive victory of the Assamese led by general [[Lachit Borphukan]] on the Mughals, then under command of Raja Ram Singha, in the [[Battle of Saraighat]] in 1671 almost ended Mughal ambitions in this region. The Mughals were comprehensively defeated in the [[Battle of Itakhuli]] and expelled from Lower Assam during the reign of [[Supaatphaa|Gadadhar Singha]] in 1682 AD.<ref>\"In the Battle of Itakhuli in September 1682, the Ahom forces chased the defeated Mughals nearly one hundred kilometers back to the Manas river.

Although the number of speakers is growing, the percentage of Assam's population who have it as a mother tongue has fallen slightly. The various Bengali dialects and closely related languages are spoken by around 9 million people in Assam, and the portion of the population that speaks these languages has grown slightly. Hindi is the third most-spoken language.\n\nTraditionally, Assamese was the language of the common folk in the ancient [[Kamarupa kingdom]] and in the medieval kingdoms of [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa Kachari]], [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya Kachari]], Borahi Kachari, [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] and [[Koch kingdom|Koch Kachari Kingdom of Kamatapur]]. Traces of the language are found in many poems by Luipa, Sarahapa, and others, in [[Charyapada]] (c. 7th\u20138th century AD). Modern dialects such as Kamrupi and [[Goalpariya dialect|Goalpariya]] are remnants of this language. Moreover, Assamese in its traditional form was used by the ethno-cultural groups in the region as lingua-franca, which spread during the stronger kingdoms and was required for economic integration. Localised forms of the language still exist in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nLinguistically modern Assamese traces its roots to the version developed by the American Missionaries based on the local form used near [[Sivasagar]] (Xiw\u00f4xag\u00f4r) district. Assamese (''\u00d4x\u00f4miya'') is a rich language due to its hybrid nature and unique characteristics of pronunciation and softness. The presence of [[Voiceless velar fricative]] in Assamese makes it a unique among other similar [[Indo-Aryan languages]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Das|first=Ankur|last2=Deka|first2=Tusmita|title=The Allophonic Variation of the Assamese voiceless velar fricative /x/|url=https://www.academia.edu/35777293}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Assamese.html|title=Assamese|website=www.languagesgulper.com|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nBodo is an ancient language of Assam. Spatial distribution patterns of the ethno-cultural groups, cultural traits and the phenomenon of naming all the major rivers in the [[North-East India|North East Region]] with Bodo-Kachari words (e.g. [[Dihing]], Dibru, [[Dihong]], D/[[Teesta River|Tista]], and Dikrai) reveal that it was the most important language in ancient times. Bodo is now spoken largely in the Western Assam (BTAD). After years of neglect, now Bodo language is getting attention and its literature is developing. Other native languages of Tibeto-Burman origin and related to Bodo-Kachari are [[Deori language|Deori]], [[Mising language|Mising]], [[Karbi language|Karbi]], [[Rabha language|Rabha]], and [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThere are approximately 564,000 [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speakers spread all over the state forming about 2.12% of Assam's total population according to 2001 census.\n\nThere are speakers of [[Tai languages]] in Assam.

The Vaishanava Movement, the 15th century religio-cultural movement under the leadership of [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] (Sonkordeu) and his disciples have provided another dimension to Assamese culture. A renewed Hinduisation in local forms took place, which was initially greatly supported by the Koch and later by the Ahom Kingdoms. The resultant social institutions such as ''[[namghar]]'' and ''[[sattra]]'' (the Vaishnav Monasteries) have become part of the Assamese way of life. The movement contributed greatly towards language, literature, and performing and fine arts.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe modern culture has been influenced by events in the British and the post-British era. The language was standardised by American [[Baptist]] [[Missionary|Missionaries]] such as [[Nathan Brown (missionary)|Nathan Brown]], [[Miles Bronson and the Noctes|Dr. Miles Bronson]] and local pundits such as [[Hemchandra Barua]] with the form available in the [[Sibsagar]] (''Sivasagar'') District (the ex-nerve centre of the Ahom Kingdom).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIncreasing efforts of standardisation in the 20th century alienated the localised forms present in different areas and with the less-assimilated [[Ethnic groups|ethno-cultural groups]] (many source-cultures). However, Assamese culture in its hybrid form and nature is one of the richest, still developing and in true sense is a '[[cultural system]]' with sub-systems. Many source-cultures of the Assamese cultural-system are still surviving either as sub-systems or as sister entities, e.g. the; [[Bodo people|Bodo]] or [[Karbi people|Karbi]] or [[Mising people|Mishing]]. It is important to keep the broader system closer to its roots and at the same time focus on development of the sub-systems.\n\nSome of the common and unique cultural traits in the region are peoples' respect towards [[Betel nut|areca-nut]] and [[betel]] leaves, symbolic ([[gamosa]], arnai, etc.), [[Assam silk|traditional silk]] garments (e.g. [[mekhela chador]], traditional dress of Assamese women) and towards forefathers and elderly. Moreover, great hospitality and bamboo culture are common.\n\n=== Symbols ===\n{{See also|List of Assam state symbols|Jaapi}}\n[[File:Bihu Assam.jpg|thumb|upright|<center>Girl in traditional [[Mekhela chador]] dress with a[[Dhol]] wrapped with Gamosa</center>]]\n[[File:Jaapi with Gamosa.jpg|thumb|upright|<center>A decorative Assamese ''[[Jaapi]]'' laid over a Gamosa</center>]]\nSymbolism is an ancient cultural practice in Assam and is still a very important part of the Assamese way of life. Various elements are used to represent beliefs, feelings, pride, identity, etc. ''Tamulpan'', ''[[Xorai]]'' and ''Gamosa'' are three important symbolic elements in Assamese culture. ''Tamulpan'' (the areca nut and betel leaves) or ''guapan'' (gua from ''kwa'') are considered along with the Gamosa (a typical woven cotton or silk cloth with embroidery) as the offers of devotion, respect and friendship. The Tamulpan-tradition is an ancient one and is being followed since time-immemorial with roots in the aboriginal Austric culture. ''[[Xorai]]'' is a traditionally manufactured bell-metal article of great respect and is used as a container-medium while performing respectful offers. Moreover, symbolically many ethno-cultural groups use specific clothes to portray respect and pride.\n\nThere were many other symbolic elements and designs, but are now only found in literature, art, sculpture, architecture, etc. or in use today for only religious purposes. The typical designs of ''Assamese-lion'', ''dragon'', and ''flying-lion'' were used for symbolising various purposes and occasions. The archaeological sites such as the Madan Kamdev (c. 9th\u201310th centuries AD) exhibits mass-scale use of lions, dragon-lions and many other figures of demons to show case power and prosperity. The Vaishnava monasteries and many other architectural sites of the late medieval period display the use of lions and dragons for symbolic effects.\n\n=== Festivals and traditions ===\n{{Main|List of festivals in Assam}}\n{{See also|Domahi|Bohag Bihu|Magh Bihu|Bwisagu}}\n[[File:Assamese Jaapi .jpg|thumb|upright|A beautifully adorned [[Jaapi]]]]\n[[File:Bihu dancer with a horn.jpg|thumb|upright|left|<center>A [[Bihu]] dancer blowing a ''[[pepa (musical instrument)|pepa]]'' (horn)</center>]]\n[[File:Ali-ai-ligang.jpg|thumb|''Tribal'' \u2013 Mising girls dancing during Ali Ai Ligang (Spring Festival)]]\nThere are diversified important traditional festivals in Assam. Bihu is the most important and common and celebrated all over Assam. It is the Assamese new year celebrated in April of the Gregorian calendar. [[Christmas]] is observed with great merriment by [[Christians]] of various denominations, including [[Catholics]] and [[Protestants]], throughout Assam. [[Durga Puja]], a festival introduced and popularised by [[Bengalis]], is widely celebrated across the state. Muslims celebrate two Eids ([[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]]) with much eagerness all over Assam.[[File:Sattriya by Dancer Meenakshi Medhi.JPG|thumb|[[Sattriya|Sattriya Dance]] ]]\n\n[[Bihu]] is a series of three prominent festivals. Primarily a non-religious festival celebrated to mark the seasons and the significant points of a cultivator's life over a yearly cycle. Three Bihus, ''rongali'' or ''bohag'', celebrated with the coming of spring and the beginning of the sowing season; ''kongali'' or ''kati'', the barren bihu when the fields are lush but the barns are empty; and the ''[[Bhogali Bihu|bhogali]]'' or ''magh'', the thanksgiving when the crops have been harvested and the barns are full. Bihu songs and Bihu dance are associated to ''rongali'' bihu. The day before the each bihu is known as 'uruka'. The first day of 'rongali bihu' is called 'Goru bihu' (the bihu of the cows), when the cows are taken to the nearby rivers or ponds to be bathed with special care. In recent times the form and nature of celebration has changed with the growth of urban centres.\n\n[[Bwisagu]] is one of the popular seasonal festivals of the [[Bodo people|Bodos]]. Bwisagu start of the new year or age. Baisagu is a Boro word which originated from the word \"Baisa\" which means year or age, ang \"Agu\" that means starting or start.\n\nBeshoma is a festival of Deshi people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nenow.in/north-east-news/bihu-myriad-colours.html|title=Bihu \u2013 Its Myriad Colours|website=NORTHEAST NOW|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref> It is a celebration of sowing crop.

This festival is celebrated during the end of January. Officially 27 January has been declared as the day of Bushu Dima festival. The Dimasa people celebrate their festival by playing musical instruments- khram (a type of drum), muri (a kind of huge long flute). The people dances to the different tunes called \"murithai\" and each dance has got its name, the prominent being the \"Baidima\" There are three types of Bushu celebrated among the Dimasas Jidap, Surem and Hangsou.\n\nChavang Kut is a post harvesting festival of the [[Kuki people|Kuki]] people. The festival is celebrated on the first day of November every year. Hence, this particular day has been officially declared as a Restricted Holiday by the Assam government. In the past, the celebration was primarily important in the religio-cultural sense. The rhythmic movements of the dances in the festival were inspired by animals, agricultural techniques and showed their relationship with ecology. Today, the celebration witnesses the shifting of stages and is revamped to suit new contexts and interpretations. The traditional dances which form the core of the festival is now performed in out-of-village settings and are staged in a secular public sphere. In Assam, the Kukis mainly reside in the two autonomous districts of Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong.\n\nMoreover, there are other important traditional festivals being celebrated every year on different occasions at different places. Many of these are celebrated by different ethno-cultural groups (sub and sister cultures). Some of these are:\n{{columns | width = 180px | gap = 5px\n| col1 =\n* [[Me-Dam-Me-Phi]]\n* [[Ali Ai Ligang|Ali-Aye-Ligang]]\n* [[Rongker]]\n* Kherai\n* Garja\n* Bisu ([[Deori people|Deori]])\n| col2 =\n* Awnkham Gwrlwi Janai\n* Chojun/Swarak\n* Deusi Bhailo ( Traditional Nepalese songs that are sung during the festival of light \" Dipavali '' and also called \"Tihar\" )\n* Sokk-erroi\n* Hacha-kekan\n* Hapsa Hatarnai\n| col3 =\n* [[Porag]]\n* [[Bathow]]\n* [[Wangala]]\n* [[Bohuwa dance]]\n}}\n\nOther few yearly celebrations are Doul Utsav of Barpeta, [[Brahmaputra Beach Festival]], Guwahati, [[Kaziranga Elephant Festival]], Kaziranga and [[Dehing Patkai Festival]], Lekhapani, Karbi Youth Festival of Diphu and International Jatinga Festival, [[Jatinga]] can not be forgotten.

is a state in northeastern [[India]], situated south of the eastern [[Himalayas]] along the [[Brahmaputra Valley|Brahmaputra]] and [[Barak River]] valleys. Assam covers an area of {{convert|78438|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.

The Assamese economy is aided by [[wildlife tourism]] to [[Kaziranga National Park]] and [[Manas National Park]], which are [[World Heritage Site]]s. [[Shorea robusta|Sal tree]] forests are found in the state which, as a result of abundant rainfall, look green all year round. Assam receives more rainfall than most parts of India; this rain feeds the [[Brahmaputra River]], whose tributaries and [[oxbow lake]]s provide the region with a hydro-[[geomorphic]] environment.\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Main|Etymology of Assam}}\nThe precise etymology of the modern anglicised word \"Assam\" is ambiguous. In the classical period and up to the 12th century the region east of the [[Karatoya river]], largely congruent to present-day Assam, was called [[Kamarupa]], and alternatively, [[Pragjyotisha]].<ref>\"Prior to the thirteenth century the present region was called K\u0101mar\u016bpa or, alternatively, Pr\u0101gjyoti\u1e63apur\", Lahiri, Nayanjot., ''Pre-Ahom Assam'' (Delhi 1991) p. 14</ref> In medieval times the Mughals used ''Asham'' (eastern Assam) and Kamrup (western Assam),<ref>Sukalpa Bhattacharjee, C Joshua Thomas,2013,''Society, Representation and Textuality:The Critical Interface'' It deals with the expansion of the Mughal Empire in Bengal, Kamrup and Assam.</ref><ref>Satish Chandra (2005), ''Medieval India:Fro Sultanate to the Mughals Part \u2013 II'' They had support of many Hindu Rajas of Jessore, Kamrup (Western Assam), Cachar, Tippera, etc.</ref><ref>Peter Jackson,2003,''The Delhi Sultanate: A Political and Military History'', P. 141, into the region of Assam the Muslims called Kamrup or Kamrud</ref> and during the British colonial era, the British used Assam. Though many authors have associated the name with the 13th century Shan invaders<ref>\"The word 'Assamese' is an English one based on the anglicised form 'Assam' from the native word \"Asam\", which in its turn is connected with the Shans who invaded the Brahmaputra Valley in the 13th century.\" Kakati, Banikanta, ''Aspects of Early Assamese Literature'' (Gauhati University Press, 1953) p1; \"Assam is the English form of 'Asama' (i.e. peerless) which is apparently a Sanskritised form of the tribal name Ahom\", DC Sircar, ''Pragjyotisha-Kamarupa'' in ''The Comprehensive History of Assam'' Vol I (Guwahati, 1991) p59 cf1; Satyendra Nath Sharma, ''Assamese Literature'' (Wiesbaden : Harrassowitz, 1976) p1; \"The term 'Assam' is, relatively speaking, of recent origin and traces back to the tradition of the Ahoms who entered the Brahmaputra valley in the thirteenth century\", Nayanjot Lahir, ''Pre-Ahom Assam'' (Delhi 1991, based on PhD Thesis) p14; \"These references show that the term 'Axom or Asom' was earlier used to mean the Shan community...Subsequently, the term came to be used to mean also the territory they ruled\", M Taher, ''Geography of Assam'' (Delhi, 2001) pp. 2\u20133</ref> the precise origin of the name is not clear.  It was suggested by some that the Sanskrit word ''Asama'' (\"unequalled\", \"peerless\", etc.) was the root, which has been rejected by Kakati,<ref>\"...but most probably ''Asama'' meaning peerless or unequalled is a latter-day Sanskritisation of some earlier form like ''\u0100ch\u0101m'', Banikanta Kakati, ''Early Aspects of Assamese Literature'' (Gauhati, 1953) p. 2</ref> and more recent authors have concurred that it is a latter-day Sanskritization of a native name.<ref>Satyendra Nath Sharma, ''Assamese Literature'' (Wiesbaden : Harrassowitz, 1976) p. 1</ref> Among possible origins are Tai (''A-Cham'')<ref>\"In Tai the root ''cham'' means \"to be undefeated\".

The last of these rulers, also Naraka, was slain by [[Krishna]].  Naraka's son Bhagadatta became the king, who (it is mentioned in the Mahabharata) fought for the [[Kaurava]]s in the [[Kurukshetra War|battle of Kurukshetra]] with an army of ''[[kiratas]]'', ''[[chinas]]'' and ''dwellers of the eastern coast''.

Until the early 1500s, the Ahoms ruled a small kingdom in [[Sibsagar district]] and suddenly expanded during King Suhungmung's rule taking advantage of weakening rule of Chutia and Dimasa kingdoms. By 1681, the whole track down to the border of the modern district of Goalpara came permanently under their sway. Ahoms ruled for nearly 600 years (1228\u20131826 AD) with major expansions in the early 16th century at the cost of [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutia]] and [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa Kachari]] kingdoms. Since c. the 13th century AD, the nerve centre of Ahom polity was upper Assam; the kingdom was gradually extended to the [[Karatoya River]] in the 17th or 18th century. It was at its zenith during the reign of [[Sukhrungphaa]] or Sworgodeu Rudra Sinha (c. 1696\u20131714 AD).\n\nThe Chutiya rulers (1187\u20131673 AD), a [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] group by origin, held the regions on both the banks of Brahmaputra with its domain in the area eastwards from [[Biswanath Chariali|Vishwanath]] (north bank) and [[Dihing River|Buridihing]] (south bank), in [[Upper Assam]] and in the state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. It was partially annexed in the early 1500s by the Ahoms, finally getting absorbed in 1673 AD. The rivalry between the Chutiyas and Ahoms for the supremacy of eastern Assam led to a series of battles between them from the early 16th century until the start of the 17th century, which saw great loss of men and money.\n\nThe Koch, another [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] dynasty, established sovereignty in c. 1510 AD. The Koch kingdom in Western Assam and present-day [[North Bengal]] was at its zenith in the early reign of [[Nara Narayan]] (c. 1540\u20131587 AD). It split into two in c. 1581 CE, the western part as a [[Moghul]] vassal and the eastern as an Ahom satellite state. Later, in 1682, [[Koch Hajo]] was entirely annexed by the Ahoms.\n\nAmong other dynasties, the [[Kachari Kingdom|Dimasa]], another [[Bodo-Kachari people|Bodo-Kachari]] dynasty, (13th century-1854 AD) ruled from Dikhow River to central and southern Assam and had their capital at [[Dimapur]]. With the expansion of Ahom kingdom, by the early 17th century, the Chutiya areas were annexed and since c. 1536 AD the Kacharis remained only in [[Cachar]] and [[North Cachar]], and more as an Ahom ally than a competing force.\n\nDespite numerous invasions, mostly by the Muslim rulers, no western power ruled Assam until the arrival of the British. Though the [[Mughal empire|Mughals]] made seventeen attempts to invade, they were never successful. The most successful invader [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]], a governor of [[Aurangzeb]], briefly occupied [[Garhgaon]] (c. 1662\u201363 AD), the then capital, but found it difficult to prevent [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] attacks on his forces, forcing them to leave. The decisive victory of the Assamese led by general [[Lachit Borphukan]] on the Mughals, then under command of Raja Ram Singha, in the [[Battle of Saraighat]] in 1671 almost ended Mughal ambitions in this region. The Mughals were comprehensively defeated in the [[Battle of Itakhuli]] and expelled from Lower Assam during the reign of [[Supaatphaa|Gadadhar Singha]] in 1682 AD.<ref>\"In the Battle of Itakhuli in September 1682, the Ahom forces chased the defeated Mughals nearly one hundred kilometers back to the Manas river.

By the 1850s, the industry started seeing some profits.

The river with steep [[Canyon|gorges]] and rapids in Arunachal Pradesh entering Assam, becomes a [[braided river]] (at times 10&nbsp;mi/16&nbsp;km wide) and with tributaries, creates a flood plain (Brahmaputra Valley: 50\u201360&nbsp;mi/80\u2013100&nbsp;km wide, 600&nbsp;mi/1000&nbsp;km long).<ref name=\"RLSinghIndia\">{{Citation\n| first = R.

Although the number of speakers is growing, the percentage of Assam's population who have it as a mother tongue has fallen slightly. The various Bengali dialects and closely related languages are spoken by around 9 million people in Assam, and the portion of the population that speaks these languages has grown slightly. Hindi is the third most-spoken language.\n\nTraditionally, Assamese was the language of the common folk in the ancient [[Kamarupa kingdom]] and in the medieval kingdoms of [[Kachari kingdom|Dimasa Kachari]], [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya Kachari]], Borahi Kachari, [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] and [[Koch kingdom|Koch Kachari Kingdom of Kamatapur]]. Traces of the language are found in many poems by Luipa, Sarahapa, and others, in [[Charyapada]] (c. 7th\u20138th century AD). Modern dialects such as Kamrupi and [[Goalpariya dialect|Goalpariya]] are remnants of this language. Moreover, Assamese in its traditional form was used by the ethno-cultural groups in the region as lingua-franca, which spread during the stronger kingdoms and was required for economic integration. Localised forms of the language still exist in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nLinguistically modern Assamese traces its roots to the version developed by the American Missionaries based on the local form used near [[Sivasagar]] (Xiw\u00f4xag\u00f4r) district. Assamese (''\u00d4x\u00f4miya'') is a rich language due to its hybrid nature and unique characteristics of pronunciation and softness. The presence of [[Voiceless velar fricative]] in Assamese makes it a unique among other similar [[Indo-Aryan languages]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Das|first=Ankur|last2=Deka|first2=Tusmita|title=The Allophonic Variation of the Assamese voiceless velar fricative /x/|url=https://www.academia.edu/35777293}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Assamese.html|title=Assamese|website=www.languagesgulper.com|access-date=21 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nBodo is an ancient language of Assam. Spatial distribution patterns of the ethno-cultural groups, cultural traits and the phenomenon of naming all the major rivers in the [[North-East India|North East Region]] with Bodo-Kachari words (e.g. [[Dihing]], Dibru, [[Dihong]], D/[[Teesta River|Tista]], and Dikrai) reveal that it was the most important language in ancient times. Bodo is now spoken largely in the Western Assam (BTAD). After years of neglect, now Bodo language is getting attention and its literature is developing. Other native languages of Tibeto-Burman origin and related to Bodo-Kachari are [[Deori language|Deori]], [[Mising language|Mising]], [[Karbi language|Karbi]], [[Rabha language|Rabha]], and [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThere are approximately 564,000 [[Nepali language|Nepali]] speakers spread all over the state forming about 2.12% of Assam's total population according to 2001 census.\n\nThere are speakers of [[Tai languages]] in Assam.

A renewed Hinduisation in local forms took place, which was initially greatly supported by the Koch and later by the Ahom Kingdoms. The resultant social institutions such as ''[[namghar]]'' and ''[[sattra]]'' (the Vaishnav Monasteries) have become part of the Assamese way of life. The movement contributed greatly towards language, literature, and performing and fine arts.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe modern culture has been influenced by events in the British and the post-British era. The language was standardised by American [[Baptist]] [[Missionary|Missionaries]] such as [[Nathan Brown (missionary)|Nathan Brown]], [[Miles Bronson and the Noctes|Dr. Miles Bronson]] and local pundits such as [[Hemchandra Barua]] with the form available in the [[Sibsagar]] (''Sivasagar'') District (the ex-nerve centre of the Ahom Kingdom).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIncreasing efforts of standardisation in the 20th century alienated the localised forms present in different areas and with the less-assimilated [[Ethnic groups|ethno-cultural groups]] (many source-cultures). However, Assamese culture in its hybrid form and nature is one of the richest, still developing and in true sense is a '[[cultural system]]' with sub-systems. Many source-cultures of the Assamese cultural-system are still surviving either as sub-systems or as sister entities, e.g. the; [[Bodo people|Bodo]] or [[Karbi people|Karbi]] or [[Mising people|Mishing]]. It is important to keep the broader system closer to its roots and at the same time focus on development of the sub-systems.\n\nSome of the common and unique cultural traits in the region are peoples' respect towards [[Betel nut|areca-nut]] and [[betel]] leaves, symbolic ([[gamosa]], arnai, etc.), [[Assam silk|traditional silk]] garments (e.g. [[mekhela chador]], traditional dress of Assamese women) and towards forefathers and elderly.

Various elements are used to represent beliefs, feelings, pride, identity, etc. ''Tamulpan'', ''[[Xorai]]'' and ''Gamosa'' are three important symbolic elements in Assamese culture. ''Tamulpan'' (the areca nut and betel leaves) or ''guapan'' (gua from ''kwa'') are considered along with the Gamosa (a typical woven cotton or silk cloth with embroidery) as the offers of devotion, respect and friendship. The Tamulpan-tradition is an ancient one and is being followed since time-immemorial with roots in the aboriginal Austric culture. ''[[Xorai]]'' is a traditionally manufactured bell-metal article of great respect and is used as a container-medium while performing respectful offers. Moreover, symbolically many ethno-cultural groups use specific clothes to portray respect and pride.\n\nThere were many other symbolic elements and designs, but are now only found in literature, art, sculpture, architecture, etc. or in use today for only religious purposes. The typical designs of ''Assamese-lion'', ''dragon'', and ''flying-lion'' were used for symbolising various purposes and occasions. The archaeological sites such as the Madan Kamdev (c. 9th\u201310th centuries AD) exhibits mass-scale use of lions, dragon-lions and many other figures of demons to show case power and prosperity. The Vaishnava monasteries and many other architectural sites of the late medieval period display the use of lions and dragons for symbolic effects.\n\n=== Festivals and traditions ===\n{{Main|List of festivals in Assam}}\n{{See also|Domahi|Bohag Bihu|Magh Bihu|Bwisagu}}\n[[File:Assamese Jaapi .jpg|thumb|upright|A beautifully adorned [[Jaapi]]]]\n[[File:Bihu dancer with a horn.jpg|thumb|upright|left|<center>A [[Bihu]] dancer blowing a ''[[pepa (musical instrument)|pepa]]'' (horn)</center>]]\n[[File:Ali-ai-ligang.jpg|thumb|''Tribal'' \u2013 Mising girls dancing during Ali Ai Ligang (Spring Festival)]]\nThere are diversified important traditional festivals in Assam. Bihu is the most important and common and celebrated all over Assam. It is the Assamese new year celebrated in April of the Gregorian calendar. [[Christmas]] is observed with great merriment by [[Christians]] of various denominations, including [[Catholics]] and [[Protestants]], throughout Assam. [[Durga Puja]], a festival introduced and popularised by [[Bengalis]], is widely celebrated across the state. Muslims celebrate two Eids ([[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]]) with much eagerness all over Assam.[[File:Sattriya by Dancer Meenakshi Medhi.JPG|thumb|[[Sattriya|Sattriya Dance]] ]]\n\n[[Bihu]] is a series of three prominent festivals. Primarily a non-religious festival celebrated to mark the seasons and the significant points of a cultivator's life over a yearly cycle. Three Bihus, ''rongali'' or ''bohag'', celebrated with the coming of spring and the beginning of the sowing season; ''kongali'' or ''kati'', the barren bihu when the fields are lush but the barns are empty; and the ''[[Bhogali Bihu|bhogali]]'' or ''magh'', the thanksgiving when the crops have been harvested and the barns are full. Bihu songs and Bihu dance are associated to ''rongali'' bihu. The day before the each bihu is known as 'uruka'. The first day of 'rongali bihu' is called 'Goru bihu' (the bihu of the cows), when the cows are taken to the nearby rivers or ponds to be bathed with special care. In recent times the form and nature of celebration has changed with the growth of urban centres.\n\n[[Bwisagu]] is one of the popular seasonal festivals of the [[Bodo people|Bodos]]. Bwisagu start of the new year or age. Baisagu is a Boro word which originated from the word \"Baisa\" which means year or age, ang \"Agu\" that means starting or start.\n\nBeshoma is a festival of Deshi people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nenow.in/north-east-news/bihu-myriad-colours.html|title=Bihu \u2013 Its Myriad Colours|website=NORTHEAST NOW|language=en-US|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref> It is a celebration of sowing crop. The Beshoma starts on the last day of Chaitra and goes on till the sixth of Baisakh.

This festival is celebrated during the end of January. Officially 27 January has been declared as the day of Bushu Dima festival. The Dimasa people celebrate their festival by playing musical instruments- khram (a type of drum), muri (a kind of huge long flute). The people dances to the different tunes called \"murithai\" and each dance has got its name, the prominent being the \"Baidima\" There are three types of Bushu celebrated among the Dimasas Jidap, Surem and Hangsou.\n\nChavang Kut is a post harvesting festival of the [[Kuki people|Kuki]] people. The festival is celebrated on the first day of November every year. Hence, this particular day has been officially declared as a Restricted Holiday by the Assam government. In the past, the celebration was primarily important in the religio-cultural sense. The rhythmic movements of the dances in the festival were inspired by animals, agricultural techniques and showed their relationship with ecology. Today, the celebration witnesses the shifting of stages and is revamped to suit new contexts and interpretations. The traditional dances which form the core of the festival is now performed in out-of-village settings and are staged in a secular public sphere. In Assam, the Kukis mainly reside in the two autonomous districts of Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong.\n\nMoreover, there are other important traditional festivals being celebrated every year on different occasions at different places. Many of these are celebrated by different ethno-cultural groups (sub and sister cultures).

On one side were newly-established [[republic]]s, led by [[History of Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser's Egypt]], and on the other side were [[wikt:traditionalist|traditionalist]] [[monarchy|kingdoms]] led by King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]] of [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nNasser espoused [[secularism|secular]], [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] [[Arab nationalism|nationalism]] and [[Arab socialism|socialism]] as a response to the [[Islamism]] and [[Rentier state|rentierism]] of the kingdoms, as well as their perceived complicity in [[Western world|Western]] meddling in the region. He also established himself as the foremost defender of Arab and [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestinian]] honor against the humiliation brought on by the independence of [[Israel]] and its victory in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war|1948 war]]. Gradually, so-called [[Nasserism]] gained the support of other Arab presidents as they replaced monarchies in their countries, notably in [[Syria]], [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], [[Yemen Arab Republic|North Yemen]], and [[History of Sudan (1969\u201385)|Sudan]]. A number of [[Arab Union|attempts to unite]] these states in various configurations were made, but all ultimately failed.\n\nIn turn, the monarchies, namely [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Jordan]], [[Morocco]], and the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|Gulf states]], drew closer together as they sought to counter Nasser's influence through a variety of direct and indirect means.<ref name=gold-75-led>{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Dore|title=Hatred's Kingdom|date=2003|publisher=Regnery|location=Washington, DC|page=75|quote=Even before he became king, Faisal turned to [[Islam]] as a counterweight to Nasser's [[Arab socialism]].

London: Oxford University Press, 1971.</ref> Despite the moniker, though, the Arab Cold War was not per se a clash between [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Communism|communist]] economic systems. What tied it into the wider conflict between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] was that the U.S. backed the Saudi-led monarchies, while the Soviets supported the Nasserist republics, even though in theory almost all of the Arab states were part of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and the nominally-socialist republics ruthlessly suppressed their own [[Communist party|communist parties]].\n\nBy the late 1970s, the Arab Cold War is considered to have ended due to a number of factors. The Soviet Union was unable to keep pace with the U.S. in supporting its Arab allies, the secular republics. These regimes became increasingly discredited among the public due to their stagnation, corruption, and continued failure to defeat Israel in the [[Six Day War|1967]] and [[Yom Kippur War|1973 wars]]. Nasser's successor [[Anwar Sadat]] [[Camp David Accords|made peace with Israel]] in 1978, and Islamism rose in popularity, culminating in the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] that established [[Iran]] as a regional power and made Egypt and Saudi Arabia allies in a new [[Iran-Saudi Arabia proxy conflict|proxy conflict]] oriented around conflict between [[Shia-Sunni relations|Shia and Sunni Muslim]] states.\n\n==Background==\nOver the period, the history of the Arab states varies widely. In 1956, the year of the [[Suez Crisis]], only [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Sudan]], among the Arab states were republics; all, to some degree, subscribed to the Arab nationalist ideology, or at least paid lip-service to it. Jordan and Iraq were both [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] monarchies; [[Morocco]], [[Kingdom of Libya|Libya]], Saudi Arabia, and [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|North Yemen]] all had independent dynasties; and [[French Algeria|Algeria]], [[Aden Protectorate|South Yemen]], [[Oman]], and the [[Trucial States]] remained under colonial rule. By 1960, [[Iraq]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], and [[Yemen Arab Republic|North Yemen]] had republican governments or Arab nationalist insurgencies while Lebanon had a [[1958 Lebanon crisis|near-civil war]] between US-aligned and Arab nationalist factions within the government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nBecause conflicts in the period varied over time and with different locations and perspectives, it is dated differently, depending on sources.

To use Islam as a counterweight to Nasser's Arab socialism, Saudi Arabia sponsored an international Islamic conference in Mecca in 1962. It created the [[Muslim World League]], dedicated to spreading Islam and fostering Islamic solidarity. The League was \"extremely effective\" in promoting Islam, particularly conservative [[Wahhabi]] Islam, and also served to combat \"radical alien ideologies\" (such as Arab socialism) in the Muslim world.<ref name=gold-76>{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Dore|title=Hatred's Kingdom|date=2003|publisher=Regnery|location=Washington, DC|page=75\u20136}}</ref>\n\nParticularly after the Six Day War, Islamic revival strengthened throughout the Arab World. After Nasser's death in 1970, his successor, Anwar Sadat, emphasized religion and economic liberalization rather than Arab nationalism and socialism.

On one side were newly-established [[republic]]s, led by [[History of Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser's Egypt]], and on the other side were [[wikt:traditionalist|traditionalist]] [[monarchy|kingdoms]] led by King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]] of [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\nNasser espoused [[secularism|secular]], [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] [[Arab nationalism|nationalism]] and [[Arab socialism|socialism]] as a response to the [[Islamism]] and [[Rentier state|rentierism]] of the kingdoms, as well as their perceived complicity in [[Western world|Western]] meddling in the region. He also established himself as the foremost defender of Arab and [[Palestine Liberation Organization|Palestinian]] honor against the humiliation brought on by the independence of [[Israel]] and its victory in the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war|1948 war]]. Gradually, so-called [[Nasserism]] gained the support of other Arab presidents as they replaced monarchies in their countries, notably in [[Syria]], [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], [[Yemen Arab Republic|North Yemen]], and [[History of Sudan (1969\u201385)|Sudan]]. A number of [[Arab Union|attempts to unite]] these states in various configurations were made, but all ultimately failed.\n\nIn turn, the monarchies, namely [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Jordan]], [[Morocco]], and the [[Gulf Cooperation Council|Gulf states]], drew closer together as they sought to counter Nasser's influence through a variety of direct and indirect means.<ref name=gold-75-led>{{cite book|last1=Gold|first1=Dore|title=Hatred's Kingdom|date=2003|publisher=Regnery|location=Washington, DC|page=75|quote=Even before he became king, Faisal turned to [[Islam]] as a counterweight to Nasser's [[Arab socialism]].

London: Oxford University Press, 1971.</ref> Despite the moniker, though, the Arab Cold War was not per se a clash between [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Communism|communist]] economic systems. What tied it into the wider conflict between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] was that the U.S. backed the Saudi-led monarchies, while the Soviets supported the Nasserist republics, even though in theory almost all of the Arab states were part of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and the nominally-socialist republics ruthlessly suppressed their own [[Communist party|communist parties]].\n\nBy the late 1970s, the Arab Cold War is considered to have ended due to a number of factors. The Soviet Union was unable to keep pace with the U.S. in supporting its Arab allies, the secular republics. These regimes became increasingly discredited among the public due to their stagnation, corruption, and continued failure to defeat Israel in the [[Six Day War|1967]] and [[Yom Kippur War|1973 wars]]. Nasser's successor [[Anwar Sadat]] [[Camp David Accords|made peace with Israel]] in 1978, and Islamism rose in popularity, culminating in the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] that established [[Iran]] as a regional power and made Egypt and Saudi Arabia allies in a new [[Iran-Saudi Arabia proxy conflict|proxy conflict]] oriented around conflict between [[Shia-Sunni relations|Shia and Sunni Muslim]] states.\n\n==Background==\nOver the period, the history of the Arab states varies widely. In 1956, the year of the [[Suez Crisis]], only [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Sudan]], among the Arab states were republics; all, to some degree, subscribed to the Arab nationalist ideology, or at least paid lip-service to it. Jordan and Iraq were both [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] monarchies; [[Morocco]], [[Kingdom of Libya|Libya]], Saudi Arabia, and [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|North Yemen]] all had independent dynasties; and [[French Algeria|Algeria]], [[Aden Protectorate|South Yemen]], [[Oman]], and the [[Trucial States]] remained under colonial rule. By 1960, [[Iraq]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], and [[Yemen Arab Republic|North Yemen]] had republican governments or Arab nationalist insurgencies while Lebanon had a [[1958 Lebanon crisis|near-civil war]] between US-aligned and Arab nationalist factions within the government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nBecause conflicts in the period varied over time and with different locations and perspectives, it is dated differently, depending on sources.

Their primary role is the protection of RAAF equipment, personnel, assets and facilities during operations. While ADGs train to counter [[special forces]] as the primary ground threat to the projection of air power, ADGs are themselves conventional forces. Other duties include training RAAF personnel in weapon handling and basic ground defence tactics.\n\nADGs are commanded by [[commissioned officer]]s known as Ground Defence Officers (GRDEFO) who receive initial training at the [[Australian Army]]'s [[Royal Military College, Duntroon|Royal Military College (RMC), Duntroon]]. Following graduation from RMC, GRDEFOs undertake the Army Regimental Officer Basic Course (Infantry) prior to RAAF-specific training at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School|RAAF Security and Fire School (RAAFSFS)]], [[RAAF Base Amberley]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nADGs do not operate [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]], which are the responsibility of the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. They are comparable to the British [[RAF Regiment|Royal Air Force Regiment]], [[USAF Security Forces]], and the [[RNZAF Security Forces]].\n\n==Current structure==\nFormerly, graduates from the RAAF Security & Fire School were placed into either 1AFDS or 2AFDS.  However, in late 2013, with the future procurement of new aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were merged with the RAAF Security Police, Airbase Protection and RAAF Military Working Dog Handlers to form Numbers 1 & 2 Security Forces Squadrons (SECFOR), boosting the strength and capability of protecting the new assets.  Along with these changes, 1SECFOR was relocated to RAAF Base Williamtown, and 3AFDS was re-activated as 3SECFOR, and based at RAAF Base Edinburgh. The ADG mustering may be broadly divided into those positions contained within a Security Forces Squadron and those within other units. Within [[Combat Support Group RAAF|Combat Support Group]], [[No. 95 Wing RAAF|No. 95 Wing]] commands the three Security Forces Squadrons.<ref name=structure>{{cite web |url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/?RAAF-pgmUdI54oD/7ZI5LVP3JEZ6o3NEOB/BC |title=Structure of the RAAF |publisher=Royal Australian Air Force |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n*[[No. 1 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Security Forces Squadron]] (1SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Amberley]]\n*[[No. 2 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 2 Security Forces Squadron]] (2SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Williamtown]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref>\n* [[No. 3 Security Forces Squadron RAAF|No. 3 Security Forces Squadron]] (3 SECFOR)\u2014[[RAAF Base Edinburgh]].<ref name=structure/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.defencejobs.gov.au/jobs/air-force/airfield-defence-guard |title=Airfield Defence Guard |work=Defence Jobs |accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nSecurity Forces Squadrons are deployable tactical units, broadly comparable in size and structure to an infantry independent rifle company, capable of providing force protection for RAAF elements or other formations. 2AFDS comprises four Rifle Flights and a Support Flight; each Rifle Flight consists of four 10-man Sections and a Headquarters element of one GRDEFO, a SGT and a signaller. Support Flight contains communications, signals, field engineering and reconnaissance elements (including snipers) and is commanded by a GRDEFO and an ADG Flight Sergeant. 1AFDS is an integrated unit of permanent and reserve members; while it is headquartered at RAAF Base Edinburgh, [[South Australia]], it has reserve Rifle Flights located in [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. In recent history 1AFDS has relocated to Amberley and has gained more permanent members with 3 rifle flights and is working closely with 2AFDS.<ref>[[#refRAAFWeb|Royal Australian Air Force website]] Accessed on 22 June 2008</ref>\n\nPermanent Air Force NCOs may be posted to a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any major RAAF base in Australia or to certain training units within [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]]. GDTS staff undertake both a training role and provide specialist advice to unit commanders. Reserve NCOs may be posted to a SECFOR Squadron, or to an instructional post or Reserve Airbase Protection Flight within one of the RAAF's 'City' Squadrons (Nos. 13, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 & 31 SQNs). ADG Warrant Officers (WOFFs) may be posted to staff or policy positions within a higher headquarters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1929\u20131939===\nFrom 1929 the RAAF began to establish an Aerodrome Defence Scheme (ADS), primarily utilizing aircrafthands to provide local defence of airfields, although it was initially limited in scope. Following the acquisition of the required equipment training began in 1931, including in both anti-aircraft and ground defence roles. Between 1931 and 1939 this also included exercises with the Army, during which Aerodrome Defence Sections defended an area against attacks by Australian Army units and RAAF aircraft. In 1939 it was directed that the scheme be expanded to include all units and stations.{{sfn|Cawardine|2017|pp=40\u201350}}\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:ADGs with Vickers Gun 1944.jpg|thumb|Aerodrome Defence Guards manning a Vickers Gun, 1944]]While the RAAF did not face a significant ground threat in the first years of [[World War II]], an Air Force Guard mustering was proposed in 1940.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.2.</ref> This mustering was to receive training in infantry tactics to defend RAAF bases against attack and would be modelled on the Royal Air Force Regiment. The idea never progressed and those recruited for the task were assigned to other musterings. Following the [[bombing of Darwin]] in 1942 and ground attacks on Allied air bases, it was realised that the RAAF needed to defend its own airfields and that ground defence training was required for RAAF personnel. Following a request to the Army, Lieutenant Colonel H.H. Carr was seconded to the RAAF from [[2/22nd Battalion (Australia)|2/22 Battalion AIF]] in May 1942. Further secondments of infantry officers and NCOs followed and the RAAF Defence School was established at Hamilton, Victoria in September of that year. The school commenced training Army and RAAF officers and NCOs as Aerodrome Defence Officers and Aerodrome Defence Instructors, who were then posted to RAAF units to deliver ground defence training.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.4.</ref>\n\nIn October 1942, the [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|Security Guards Unit]] was formed at [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone Field]], [[Northern Territory]].<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.28.</ref> All RAAF guards were posted to this unit, irrespective of where they were serving. The Security Guards Unit was charged with providing guards for operational bases both within Australia and overseas. Trainees were instructed in the employment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s, ground patrolling, scouting and hand-to-hand combat. At first the unit had a strength of 567 personnel, increasing to 943 by July 1943; in that year the unit moved to Darwin.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.162.</ref> The unit was renamed [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron]] in April 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.164.</ref>[[Image:Gravestone of LAC Thomas Irvine, RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine, Labuan]]\n\nA second unit, the Defence Pool, was established at [[Noemfoor]] in December 1944.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.163.</ref> It is believed that guards may have been trained at the Security Guards Unit and then posted to the Defence Pool for operational deployment. A detachment of the Defence Pool was deployed to [[Morotai]] island in early 1945 in order to prepare a camp for the arrival of the main party of the unit. The Defence Pool was subsequently ordered to be disbanded on 28 March 1945; however a reconsideration led to the establishment of No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron. By May of that year ADGs had participated in a number of operations, including the recapture of [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]],<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.217.</ref> [[Brunei]] and [[Balikpapan]].<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.20.</ref> They had also suffered casualties, among them Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine and Corporal Clarence Tully<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.224.</ref> who were killed during Japanese raids on [[Juwata Airport|Tarakan airfield]]. LAC Irvine died on 5 May 1945<ref>[[#refOdgers1957|Odgers 1957]], p.458.</ref> and is believed to be the first ADG killed by enemy action; he is buried in the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery on Labuan Island.\n\n===1945\u20131965===\nFollowing the end of hostilities, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were disbanded on 19 November 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Aerodrome Defence Officers (ADOs) and Aerodrome Defence Instructors (ADIs) were retained to deliver basic ground defence instruction to RAAF members during initial and continuation training. A significant proportion of RAAF National Service recruits received training in ground defence techniques. This included the use of the .303 rifle, Thompson Sub-Machine Gun, Bren Light Machine Gun and hand grenades, in addition to fieldcraft skills. No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron was re-established at Mallala, South Australia as a National Service unit in 1951, then once again disbanded in 1952. There is evidence to suggest that the RAAF considered the introduction of an armoured car capability in the 1950s,<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.332.</ref> with ADIs attending training on [[T17E1 Staghound|Staghound]] vehicles with the Army at [[Puckapunyal]];<ref>[[#refWalker2007|Walker 2007]] p.144.</ref> this project was never brought to fruition.\n\nIn June 1965 a submission to the Air Board requested the establishment of 455 positions to provide for the defence of the eleven major RAAF bases in Australia, as well as overseas bases in Malaysia, Thailand and South Vietnam.<ref>[[#refWilson1999|Wilson 1999]], p.85.</ref> In the end, the ADG mustering was re-established in October 1965<ref name=\"Wilson\">[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.79.</ref> with an authorised strength of 220 new positions in addition to the remustering of all Drill Instructors and ADIs.<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.64.</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Vietnam War]], Australia was asked to increase its level of commitment. To meet these new demands, the RAAF deployed a number of aircraft to Phan Rang Airbase, South Vietnam, in 1966. The [[USAF Air Police|USAF Security Police]] unit assigned to the base, asked the RAAF to contribute to the defence of the base.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nADG Flights were deployed to South Vietnam with 2 Squadron at [[Phan Rang Air Base]] and No. 1 Operational Support Unit (1OSU) at [[Vung Tau]]. ADGs were also deployed to [[Ubon|Ubon Air Base]], [[Thailand]] to protect the RAAF detachment based there, including 79 Squadron flying Sabre jets. In Vietnam ADGs conducted both static security tasks and security patrols outside the base perimeter,<ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.302.</ref> thus disrupting the Viet Cong ability to conduct stand-off attacks against the bases. Corporal N.E. Power became the first airman to win the [[Military Medal]] (MM) since the Second World War for a night action on 11 February 1970, during which an enemy reconnaissance party was successfully ambushed near the perimeter of the Phan Rang base.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], p.238.</ref><ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.318.</ref> Airfield Defence Guards also provided most of the door gunners on [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters with [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No. 9 Squadron]] during the war.<ref>[[#refOdgers1974|Odgers 1974]], p.87.</ref><ref>[[#refHaran2004|Haran 2004]], p.26.</ref>\n\nWhen the government of South Vietnam collapsed in 1975, Australia ordered the evacuation of its embassy in Saigon.

It\nregularly deployed on RAAF and joint exercises such as those in the Kangaroo series along with occasional deployments to Malaysia and New Zealand.\n\nNew capabilities were trialled, such as scout dogs to aid in detection and tracking of enemy parties and the employment on Exercise Pitch Black 1990 of [[M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier]]s from the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment to provide armoured mobility for the QRF. Both capabilities may be considered to have matured in recent years with the attachment of Security Police (SECPOL) Military Working Dog (MWD) teams to ADG patrols and the introduction into RAAF service of the [[Bushmaster IMV|Bushmaster]] [[armored personnel carrier|Infantry Mobility Vehicles]].<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsJuly132006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> In 1992 2AFDS became the first non-flying unit to be awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]].<ref>[[#refArmstrong1992|Armstrong 1992]], p.1</ref>\n\nThe period saw a generational change in weapons and equipment on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms were replaced by the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, apprentice and initial officer training. The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for every member of the RAAF; at the same time the Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3\u20135 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.\n\nIn 1992 1AFDS was reformed at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], [[Northern Territory]] as a Ready Reserve unit. The Ready Reserve Scheme involved recruits enlisting for 12 months full-time service, completing identical recruit and trade training to that undertaken by regular airmen, followed by 4 years part-time service.<ref>[[#refSmith2006|Smith 2006]], p.36.</ref> The cadre staff of 1AFDS consisted of Permanent Air Force (PAF) GRDEFOs and ADG NCOs; while the Ready Reserve Scheme was abolished in 1996, the RAAF implemented the Ground Defence Reserve Group based upon a similar concept, although with the full-time service commitment reduced to 9 months. This scheme is still in operation.\n\nAs individuals or in small groups, ADGs and GREDFOs deployed on peacekeeping operations in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], were attached to Army units providing [[Rifle Company Butterworth]] rotations and deployed to the Middle East with [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No. 33 Squadron]] in 1998. 2AFDS also deployed a Rifle Flight to assist with the evacuation of civilians from [[Cambodia]] in 1997 as part of [[Operation Vista]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n===East Timor===\nWhilst preparing for deployment to Exercise Crocodile 99, 2AFDS, along with No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron (381ECSS) and 382ECSS, were warned out for duty in East Timor on [[Operation Warden]]. Both 381ECSS and 382ECSS had ADGs and GRDEFOs on strength. 2AFDS and 381ECSS commenced deployment to Comoro Airfield, Dili, on 20 September 1999;<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.39.</ref> 381ECSS began arriving at Cakung Airfield, Baucau on 11 October 1999.<ref>[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.56.</ref> 2AFDS undertook static security, access control and reconnaissance patrol tasks, in addition to establishing observation posts and providing a Quick Reaction Force (QRF).

Following severe rioting in April 2006, members of 2AFDS were deployed as part of the ADF response to support police in reestablishing law and order.

These have included [[Operation Gold]], the provision of ADF support to the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000; [[Operation Deluge]], the provision of security to the 2007 Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum meetings in Sydney; and [[Operation Ramp]],<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsSep72006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 15 July 2008</ref> the evacuation of Australian and foreign nationals from [[Lebanon]] in 2006 during the conflict between Israeli forces and [[Hezbollah]].\n\n2AFDS was presented with a squadron [[War flag|standard]] by the [[Governor-General of Australia]], Her Excellency Ms [[Quentin Bryce]], at RAAF Base Amberley on 19 May 2011<ref>{{cite news |last=Stackpool |first=Andrew |url=http://airforcenews.realviewdigital.com/?xml=defencenews_airforce.xml&iid=48995&startpage=6&crd=0&searchKey=2AFDS |title=Rain fails to spoil colourful days |accessdate=13 January 2015 |newspaper=Air Force News |date=9 June 2011 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nMembers are enlisted as ADGs in the Permanent Air Force for an initial period of service of four years; those joining the Ground Defence Reserve Group are employed on full-time service for 11 months, followed by 4 years part-time service. Once a candidate has successfully completed RAAF recruit training they attend the 15-week ADG Basic course at the [[RAAF Security and Fire School]] (RAAFSFS) RAAF Amberley, Queensland. Upon completion of trade training ADGs may wear the blue-grey beret which identifies them as a ground defence specialist.\n\nAirmen graduate from ADG Basic course with the rank of Aircraftman (AC) and are posted to one of the 3 Security Forces Squadrons. Following a further 12 months service and favourable reporting, ADGs are reclassified to the rank of Leading Aircraftman (LAC). Post-graduate training may be undertaken to qualify in communications, field engineering/assault pioneer, direct fire support weapons, close personal protection and sniping;<ref>[[#refDFRTWeb|Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> the majority of these courses being undertaken at Army training establishments. Further promotion is based upon minimum periods in rank, successful completion of appropriate trade and promotion courses, performance reporting and availability of positions. All ADGs must qualify as weapon instructors prior to promotion to NCO rank. Out of mustering postings may be available, with ADGs having served within [[Australia's Federation Guard]], as career advisers within a Defence Recruiting Centre and as Military Skills Instructors (MSIs) at [[No. 1 Recruit Training Unit RAAF|No. 1 Recruit Training Unit (1RTU)]], [[RAAF Base Wagga|RAAF Base Wagga Wagga]] and Officer Training School (OTS), [[RAAF Base East Sale]].\n\n==Duties and mission roles==\n[[File:Royal Australian Air Force security forces conduct a patrol through Tarin Kowt in March 2013.jpg|thumb|RAAF security force personnel patrolling through [[Tarin Kowt]] in Afghanistan during 2013]]\nADGs form the basis of the Air Force's ground combat force, protecting Base assets, infrastructure and personnel against attack by enemy ground forces. For planning purposes, a nominal Area of Operations (AO) for RAAF ground defence is usually extends to five kilometres from the airfield [[perimeter fence]]; in practice, however, the AO assigned to ADGs is determined by variables such as available forces, terrain, vegetation etc. ADGs are trained and equipped to locate, fix and destroy enemy ground forces, ideally during the reconnaissance phase of any intended attack on RAAF assets. This is achieved by the deployment of multiple patrol teams, usually consisting of 4\u20135 members, undertaking reconnaissance patrols, observation and listening posts. These teams are supported by specialist elements including snipers operating in a counter-sniper role. Once the enemy are located, forces are concentrated to engage and destroy their capability to complete their task. ADGs also provide a Base Commander with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) mounted in wheeled vehicles. QRF teams are heavily armed and act as a mobile reserve to provide a counter-attack or counter-penetration capability should an enemy evade the patrol screen.\n\nIn addition to their operational role ADG instructors provide essential ground defence training to the remainder of the RAAF. This includes instruction in weapon handling, ground defence and security tactics and Chemical, Biological, Radiologican and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) may be posted to instructional positions at 1RTU; OTS; the [[Australian Defence Force Academy|Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA)]], [[Canberra]]; [[Combat Survival Training School RAAF|Combat Survival Training School]] (CSTS, also known as COMSURV), [[RAAF Base Townsville]]; RAAF Security & Fire School, RAAF Base Amberley or a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any RAAF Base in Australia.\n\n===Tasks performed by ADGs===\n[[File:RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules during Cope North 2018.jpg|thumb|A RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules aircraft during an exercise in 2018]]\n* patrolling over extended periods over arduous terrain and in extreme climatic conditions carrying a specified load necessary to accomplish the mission;\n* foot and vehicle patrolling by day and by night in and around both established and bare base airfields and through vegetated or urban environments in all extremities of weather conditions and locations within or outside of Australia;\n* manning of Observation Posts (OPs), Listening Posts (LPs) and standing patrols to detect and interdict enemy movement\n* Quick Reaction Force (QRF) duties in response to identified threats;\n* Aircraft Security Operations providing protection to both aircraft and infrastructure;\n* construction of field defences and obstacles such as weapon pits and bunkers, fences and vehicle check points (VCPs);\n* search and clearance operations;\n* manning of crew served weapons such as machine guns and anti-armour weapons;\n* security for special events;\n* instruction on small arms including pistols, rifles, shotguns and [[Light Support Weapon]]s (LSWs);\n* instruction in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence; and\n* instruction in individual and unit ground defence tactics and techniques.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:RAAF Bushmaster.JPG|thumb|An RAAF Bushmaster]]\nThe weapons and equipment issued to ADGs are similar to standard [[Royal Australian Infantry Corps|Australian infantry]] [[Weaponry of the Australian Army|equipment]].\n\n===Weapons===\n* [[Browning Hi-Power|L9A1/L9A3 Self Loading Pistol (Browning Hi-Power)]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5|Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun]]\n* [[Steyr AUG|F88 Austeyr rifle (Steyr AUG)]]\n* [[SR-25|SR25 Marksman Rifle]]\n* [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|Accuracy International SR-98 sniper rifle]]\n* [[FN Minimi|F89 Light Support Weapon (Minimi)]]\n* [[FN MAG|MAG58 General-Purpose Machine Gun]]\n* [[M203 grenade launcher]]<ref>[http://www.airforce.gov.au/adg/weapons.aspx RAAF Airfield Defence Guard webpage] Retrieved: 6 January 2009.</ref> (as part of the [[F88 Austeyr#Australian|F88 GLA Austeyr rifle]])\n* [[M72 LAW|M72 Light Anti-armour Weapon]]\n* [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]]\n* F1 hand grenade\n* [[Remington Model 870]] 12-gauge shotgun\n\nThe primary weaponry used by ADGs consists of the F88 Austeyr (with or without the M203 Grenade Launcher Attachment), F89 Minimi, and the Browning Hi-Power Self Loading Pistol.

However, in late 2013, with the future procurement of new aircraft, such as the F-35 Lightning II, both Airfield Defence Squadrons were merged with the RAAF Security Police, Airbase Protection and RAAF Military Working Dog Handlers to form Numbers 1 & 2 Security Forces Squadrons (SECFOR), boosting the strength and capability of protecting the new assets.  Along with these changes, 1SECFOR was relocated to RAAF Base Williamtown, and 3AFDS was re-activated as 3SECFOR, and based at RAAF Base Edinburgh. The ADG mustering may be broadly divided into those positions contained within a Security Forces Squadron and those within other units.

Support Flight contains communications, signals, field engineering and reconnaissance elements (including snipers) and is commanded by a GRDEFO and an ADG Flight Sergeant. 1AFDS is an integrated unit of permanent and reserve members; while it is headquartered at RAAF Base Edinburgh, [[South Australia]], it has reserve Rifle Flights located in [[New South Wales]], South Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]]. In recent history 1AFDS has relocated to Amberley and has gained more permanent members with 3 rifle flights and is working closely with 2AFDS.<ref>[[#refRAAFWeb|Royal Australian Air Force website]] Accessed on 22 June 2008</ref>\n\nPermanent Air Force NCOs may be posted to a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any major RAAF base in Australia or to certain training units within [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Air Force Training Group]].

Following the acquisition of the required equipment training began in 1931, including in both anti-aircraft and ground defence roles. Between 1931 and 1939 this also included exercises with the Army, during which Aerodrome Defence Sections defended an area against attacks by Australian Army units and RAAF aircraft. In 1939 it was directed that the scheme be expanded to include all units and stations.{{sfn|Cawardine|2017|pp=40\u201350}}\n\n===Second World War===\n[[Image:ADGs with Vickers Gun 1944.jpg|thumb|Aerodrome Defence Guards manning a Vickers Gun, 1944]]While the RAAF did not face a significant ground threat in the first years of [[World War II]], an Air Force Guard mustering was proposed in 1940.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.2.</ref> This mustering was to receive training in infantry tactics to defend RAAF bases against attack and would be modelled on the Royal Air Force Regiment. The idea never progressed and those recruited for the task were assigned to other musterings. Following the [[bombing of Darwin]] in 1942 and ground attacks on Allied air bases, it was realised that the RAAF needed to defend its own airfields and that ground defence training was required for RAAF personnel. Following a request to the Army, Lieutenant Colonel H.H. Carr was seconded to the RAAF from [[2/22nd Battalion (Australia)|2/22 Battalion AIF]] in May 1942. Further secondments of infantry officers and NCOs followed and the RAAF Defence School was established at Hamilton, Victoria in September of that year. The school commenced training Army and RAAF officers and NCOs as Aerodrome Defence Officers and Aerodrome Defence Instructors, who were then posted to RAAF units to deliver ground defence training.<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.4.</ref>\n\nIn October 1942, the [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|Security Guards Unit]] was formed at [[Livingstone Airfield|Livingstone Field]], [[Northern Territory]].<ref>[[#refKerr1985|Kerr 1985]], p.28.</ref> All RAAF guards were posted to this unit, irrespective of where they were serving. The Security Guards Unit was charged with providing guards for operational bases both within Australia and overseas. Trainees were instructed in the employment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft gun]]s, ground patrolling, scouting and hand-to-hand combat. At first the unit had a strength of 567 personnel, increasing to 943 by July 1943; in that year the unit moved to Darwin.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.162.</ref> The unit was renamed [[No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF|No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron]] in April 1945.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.164.</ref>[[Image:Gravestone of LAC Thomas Irvine, RAAF.jpg|thumb|left|Gravestone of Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine, Labuan]]\n\nA second unit, the Defence Pool, was established at [[Noemfoor]] in December 1944.<ref>[[#refRAAFHistoricalSection1995|RAAF Historical Section 1995]], p.163.</ref> It is believed that guards may have been trained at the Security Guards Unit and then posted to the Defence Pool for operational deployment. A detachment of the Defence Pool was deployed to [[Morotai]] island in early 1945 in order to prepare a camp for the arrival of the main party of the unit. The Defence Pool was subsequently ordered to be disbanded on 28 March 1945; however a reconsideration led to the establishment of No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron. By May of that year ADGs had participated in a number of operations, including the recapture of [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]],<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.217.</ref> [[Brunei]] and [[Balikpapan]].<ref>[[#refBaker1971|Baker 1971]], p.20.</ref> They had also suffered casualties, among them Leading Aircraftman Thomas Irvine and Corporal Clarence Tully<ref>[[#refStanley1997|Stanley 1997]], p.224.</ref> who were killed during Japanese raids on [[Juwata Airport|Tarakan airfield]].

A significant proportion of RAAF National Service recruits received training in ground defence techniques. This included the use of the .303 rifle, Thompson Sub-Machine Gun, Bren Light Machine Gun and hand grenades, in addition to fieldcraft skills. No. 1 Airfield Defence Squadron was re-established at Mallala, South Australia as a National Service unit in 1951, then once again disbanded in 1952. There is evidence to suggest that the RAAF considered the introduction of an armoured car capability in the 1950s,<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.332.</ref> with ADIs attending training on [[T17E1 Staghound|Staghound]] vehicles with the Army at [[Puckapunyal]];<ref>[[#refWalker2007|Walker 2007]] p.144.</ref> this project was never brought to fruition.\n\nIn June 1965 a submission to the Air Board requested the establishment of 455 positions to provide for the defence of the eleven major RAAF bases in Australia, as well as overseas bases in Malaysia, Thailand and South Vietnam.<ref>[[#refWilson1999|Wilson 1999]], p.85.</ref> In the end, the ADG mustering was re-established in October 1965<ref name=\"Wilson\">[[#refWilson2003|Wilson 2003]], p.79.</ref> with an authorised strength of 220 new positions in addition to the remustering of all Drill Instructors and ADIs.<ref>[[#refStephens1995|Stephens 1995]], p.64.</ref> After the outbreak of the [[Vietnam War]], Australia was asked to increase its level of commitment. To meet these new demands, the RAAF deployed a number of aircraft to Phan Rang Airbase, South Vietnam, in 1966. The [[USAF Air Police|USAF Security Police]] unit assigned to the base, asked the RAAF to contribute to the defence of the base.\n\n===Vietnam War===\nADG Flights were deployed to South Vietnam with 2 Squadron at [[Phan Rang Air Base]] and No. 1 Operational Support Unit (1OSU) at [[Vung Tau]]. ADGs were also deployed to [[Ubon|Ubon Air Base]], [[Thailand]] to protect the RAAF detachment based there, including 79 Squadron flying Sabre jets. In Vietnam ADGs conducted both static security tasks and security patrols outside the base perimeter,<ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.302.</ref> thus disrupting the Viet Cong ability to conduct stand-off attacks against the bases. Corporal N.E. Power became the first airman to win the [[Military Medal]] (MM) since the Second World War for a night action on 11 February 1970, during which an enemy reconnaissance party was successfully ambushed near the perimeter of the Phan Rang base.<ref>[[#refCoulthard-Clark1995|Coulthard-Clark 1995]], p.238.</ref><ref>[[#refBennett1995|Bennett 1995]], p.318.</ref> Airfield Defence Guards also provided most of the door gunners on [[UH-1 Iroquois]] helicopters with [[No. 9 Squadron RAAF|No. 9 Squadron]] during the war.<ref>[[#refOdgers1974|Odgers 1974]], p.87.</ref><ref>[[#refHaran2004|Haran 2004]], p.26.</ref>\n\nWhen the government of South Vietnam collapsed in 1975, Australia ordered the evacuation of its embassy in Saigon.

It\nregularly deployed on RAAF and joint exercises such as those in the Kangaroo series along with occasional deployments to Malaysia and New Zealand.\n\nNew capabilities were trialled, such as scout dogs to aid in detection and tracking of enemy parties and the employment on Exercise Pitch Black 1990 of [[M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier]]s from the Army's 2nd Cavalry Regiment to provide armoured mobility for the QRF. Both capabilities may be considered to have matured in recent years with the attachment of Security Police (SECPOL) Military Working Dog (MWD) teams to ADG patrols and the introduction into RAAF service of the [[Bushmaster IMV|Bushmaster]] [[armored personnel carrier|Infantry Mobility Vehicles]].<ref>[[#refAirForceNewsJuly132006|Air Force News website]] Accessed on 10 July 2008</ref> In 1992 2AFDS became the first non-flying unit to be awarded the [[Gloucester Cup|Duke of Gloucester Cup]].<ref>[[#refArmstrong1992|Armstrong 1992]], p.1</ref>\n\nThe period saw a generational change in weapons and equipment on issue to ADGs; jungle green uniforms were replaced by the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform (DPCU), the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]] (SLR), M16 and F1 Sub-Machine Gun were replaced by the F88 Austeyr assault rifle and Vietnam-era radios were replaced with the Raven series of VHF and HF sets. ADGs continued to deliver weapon and ground defence training to RAAF personnel and provided the majority of instructors for recruit, apprentice and initial officer training. The scope of this role, the longest and most continuous of the ADG mustering and its predecessors, may be gauged by the delivery of conversion training from the L1A1 SLR to the F88 rifle for every member of the RAAF; at the same time the Ground Defence Training Sections, manned on each base by 3\u20135 ADGs and GRDEFOs, commenced delivery of additional ground defence training for all RAAF members as the service transitioned to an expeditionary role.\n\nIn 1992 1AFDS was reformed at [[RAAF Base Tindal]], [[Northern Territory]] as a Ready Reserve unit. The Ready Reserve Scheme involved recruits enlisting for 12 months full-time service, completing identical recruit and trade training to that undertaken by regular airmen, followed by 4 years part-time service.<ref>[[#refSmith2006|Smith 2006]], p.36.</ref> The cadre staff of 1AFDS consisted of Permanent Air Force (PAF) GRDEFOs and ADG NCOs; while the Ready Reserve Scheme was abolished in 1996, the RAAF implemented the Ground Defence Reserve Group based upon a similar concept, although with the full-time service commitment reduced to 9 months. This scheme is still in operation.\n\nAs individuals or in small groups, ADGs and GREDFOs deployed on peacekeeping operations in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], were attached to Army units providing [[Rifle Company Butterworth]] rotations and deployed to the Middle East with [[No. 33 Squadron RAAF|No. 33 Squadron]] in 1998. 2AFDS also deployed a Rifle Flight to assist with the evacuation of civilians from [[Cambodia]] in 1997 as part of [[Operation Vista]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n===East Timor===\nWhilst preparing for deployment to Exercise Crocodile 99, 2AFDS, along with No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron (381ECSS) and 382ECSS, were warned out for duty in East Timor on [[Operation Warden]].

Following severe rioting in April 2006, members of 2AFDS were deployed as part of the ADF response to support police in reestablishing law and order. A further link with the Solomon Islands exists via Protective Service Officer Adam Dunning of the Australian Federal Police, who was shot and killed in Honiara in December 2004. Although deployed to the Solomon Islands in his civilian role, Dunning was a reservist ADG and had previously served with 2AFDS in East Timor.\n\n===Iraq===\n[[Image:USAF RAAF guards 031103-F-0000S-001.jpg|thumb|Two Airfield Defence Guards (at left and second from the right) with members of the USAF 447th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron at [[Baghdad International Airport]]]]\nAs part of [[Operation Catalyst]], ADGs provided force protection to the RAAF air traffic control detachment at Baghdad International Airport, during 2003\u201304.<ref>[[#refDoDWeb|Dept of Defence website]] Accessed on 6 July 2008</ref> Thirteen ADGs from 2AFDS deployed to Baghdad with Security Detachment (SECDET) 13, the Australian combat team providing security for the Australian Embassy and close protection for officials.<ref>[[#refNyhan2008|Nyhan 2008]], p.9</ref> The ADGs were integrated within the infantry component of SECDET 13, drawn from the [[7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (7RAR).

For planning purposes, a nominal Area of Operations (AO) for RAAF ground defence is usually extends to five kilometres from the airfield [[perimeter fence]]; in practice, however, the AO assigned to ADGs is determined by variables such as available forces, terrain, vegetation etc. ADGs are trained and equipped to locate, fix and destroy enemy ground forces, ideally during the reconnaissance phase of any intended attack on RAAF assets. This is achieved by the deployment of multiple patrol teams, usually consisting of 4\u20135 members, undertaking reconnaissance patrols, observation and listening posts. These teams are supported by specialist elements including snipers operating in a counter-sniper role. Once the enemy are located, forces are concentrated to engage and destroy their capability to complete their task. ADGs also provide a Base Commander with a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) mounted in wheeled vehicles. QRF teams are heavily armed and act as a mobile reserve to provide a counter-attack or counter-penetration capability should an enemy evade the patrol screen.\n\nIn addition to their operational role ADG instructors provide essential ground defence training to the remainder of the RAAF. This includes instruction in weapon handling, ground defence and security tactics and Chemical, Biological, Radiologican and Nuclear (CBRN) defence. Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs) may be posted to instructional positions at 1RTU; OTS; the [[Australian Defence Force Academy|Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA)]], [[Canberra]]; [[Combat Survival Training School RAAF|Combat Survival Training School]] (CSTS, also known as COMSURV), [[RAAF Base Townsville]]; RAAF Security & Fire School, RAAF Base Amberley or a Ground Defence Training Section (GDTS) at any RAAF Base in Australia.\n\n===Tasks performed by ADGs===\n[[File:RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules during Cope North 2018.jpg|thumb|A RAAF security forces member with a C-130J Hercules aircraft during an exercise in 2018]]\n* patrolling over extended periods over arduous terrain and in extreme climatic conditions carrying a specified load necessary to accomplish the mission;\n* foot and vehicle patrolling by day and by night in and around both established and bare base airfields and through vegetated or urban environments in all extremities of weather conditions and locations within or outside of Australia;\n* manning of Observation Posts (OPs), Listening Posts (LPs) and standing patrols to detect and interdict enemy movement\n* Quick Reaction Force (QRF) duties in response to identified threats;\n* Aircraft Security Operations providing protection to both aircraft and infrastructure;\n* construction of field defences and obstacles such as weapon pits and bunkers, fences and vehicle check points (VCPs);\n* search and clearance operations;\n* manning of crew served weapons such as machine guns and anti-armour weapons;\n* security for special events;\n* instruction on small arms including pistols, rifles, shotguns and [[Light Support Weapon]]s (LSWs);\n* instruction in Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) defence; and\n* instruction in individual and unit ground defence tactics and techniques.\n\n==Equipment==\n[[File:RAAF Bushmaster.JPG|thumb|An RAAF Bushmaster]]\nThe weapons and equipment issued to ADGs are similar to standard [[Royal Australian Infantry Corps|Australian infantry]] [[Weaponry of the Australian Army|equipment]].\n\n===Weapons===\n* [[Browning Hi-Power|L9A1/L9A3 Self Loading Pistol (Browning Hi-Power)]]\n* [[Heckler & Koch MP5|Heckler & Koch MP5 sub-machine gun]]\n* [[Steyr AUG|F88 Austeyr rifle (Steyr AUG)]]\n* [[SR-25|SR25 Marksman Rifle]]\n* [[Accuracy International Arctic Warfare|Accuracy International SR-98 sniper rifle]]\n* [[FN Minimi|F89 Light Support Weapon (Minimi)]]\n* [[FN MAG|MAG58 General-Purpose Machine Gun]]\n* [[M203 grenade launcher]]<ref>[http://www.airforce.gov.au/adg/weapons.aspx RAAF Airfield Defence Guard webpage] Retrieved: 6 January 2009.</ref> (as part of the [[F88 Austeyr#Australian|F88 GLA Austeyr rifle]])\n* [[M72 LAW|M72 Light Anti-armour Weapon]]\n* [[Carl Gustav recoilless rifle]]\n* F1 hand grenade\n* [[Remington Model 870]] 12-gauge shotgun\n\nThe primary weaponry used by ADGs consists of the F88 Austeyr (with or without the M203 Grenade Launcher Attachment), F89 Minimi, and the Browning Hi-Power Self Loading Pistol.
