Elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number. The standard form of the table consists of a grid with rows called [[Periodic table period|periods]] and columns called [[Periodic table group|groups]].\n\nThe '''history of the periodic table''' reflects over two centuries of growth in the understanding of the chemical and physical properties of the elements, with major contributions made by [[Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier]], [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]], [[John Alexander Reina Newlands|John Newlands]], [[Julius Lothar Meyer]], [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], [[Glenn T.

R. (2006). ''The Periodic Table: Its Story ad Its Significance''; New York City, New York; Oxford University Press.</ref> Around 330 BCE, the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more ''roots'', an idea that had originally been suggested by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]]. The four roots, which were later renamed as ''elements'' by [[Plato]], were ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[fire (classical element)|fire]]''. Similar ideas about these four elements also existed in other ancient traditions, such as [[Indian philosophy]].\n\n== First categorizations ==\n\nThe history of the periodic table is also a history of the [[Timeline of chemical elements discoveries|discovery of the chemical elements]]. The first person in history to discover a new element was [[Hennig Brand]], a [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] [[Germans|German]] merchant. Brand tried to discover the [[Philosopher's Stone]]\u2014a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base [[metal]]s into gold. In 1669 (or later), his experiments with [[Distillation|distilled]] human [[urine]] resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called \"cold fire\" (''kaltes Feuer'').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/discoveryoftheel002045mbp#page/n135/mode/2up|title=Discovery of the Elements|last1=Weeks|first1=Mary|date=1956|publisher=Journal of Chemical Education|edition=6th|location=Easton, Pennsylvania, USA|page=122}}</ref> He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when Irish chemist [[Robert Boyle]] rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings. The discovery of phosphorus helped to raise the question of what it meant for a substance to be an element.\n\n[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Hennig Brand |[[Hennig Brand]], as shown in ''[[The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus]]'']]\n\nIn 1661, Boyle defined an element as \"those primitive and simple Bodies of which the mixt ones are said to be composed, and into which they are ultimately resolved.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/scepticalchymis00BoylA#page/16/mode/2up|title=The Skeptical Chymist|last1=Boyle|first1=Robert|date=1661|publisher=J. Crooke|location=London, England|page=16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1789, French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] wrote ''[[Trait\u00e9 \u00c9l\u00e9mentaire de Chimie]]'' (''Elementary Treatise of Chemistry''), which is considered to be the first modern [[textbook]] about [[chemistry]]. Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements.

Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table.

In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.<ref name=\"pastfuture\" />\n\nEven as Mendeleev corrected positions of some elements, he thought that some relationships that he could find in his grand scheme of periodicity could not be found because some elements were still undiscovered, and thus he believed these elements that were still undiscovered would have properties that could be deduced from the expected relationships with other elements. In 1870, he first tried to characterize the yet undiscovered elements, and he gave detailed [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|predictions]] for three elements, which he termed eka-boron, eka-aluminium, and eka-silicium. In 1871, he expanded his predictions further as well as named a few more elements, although he noted that the principles described for those three elements can be used to describe other missing elements, noting that he wouldn't for that reason describe the elements himself.{{Efn|1=Those elements Mendeleev explicitly mentioned, saying he would be most interested to see them discovered were: eka-caesium, dvi-caesium, eka-niobium, eka-tantalum, eka-manganese, tri-manganese, as well as a \"the entire ninth row and even almost a whole big period (starting with Ce = 140)\".}}\n\nCompared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev's 1869 list misplaces seven then-known elements: [[indium]], [[thorium]] and the five rare earths \u2014 [[yttrium]], [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], erbium, and [[didymium]] (the latter two were later found to be mixtures of different elements); ignoring those would allow to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight. These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights.{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|p=159}} Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by a half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]).{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|pp=174\u2013175}} Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. \n\nMendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]] with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements,  which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew was is now called [[tungsten]]).<ref name=\"scimag19\">{{cite journal|last=Cheisson|first=T.|last2=Schelter|first2=E.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here.

Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]].

Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s.

In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table. By this time he had already seen the publication of Mendeleev's first periodic table, but his work appears to have been largely independent.<ref name=scerri06/>\n\nRussian chemist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] arranged the elements by [[atomic mass]], corresponding to relative [[molar mass]].

Mendeleev also figured some spots in his ordering had no element to match, and he left gaps on account of future discoveries of these elements, using the elements before and after those missing ones to predict their properties.

It has gaps in row 0 (hypothesized elements lighter than hydrogen) and row 9 (lanthanides).]]\n\n=== Mendeleev's predictions and inability to incorporate the rare earth metals ===\nIn addition to the predictions of scandium, gallium, and germanium that were quickly realized, Mendeleev's 1871 table left many more spaces for undiscovered elements, though he did not provide detailed predictions of their properties. In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.<ref name=\"pastfuture\" />\n\nEven as Mendeleev corrected positions of some elements, he thought that some relationships that he could find in his grand scheme of periodicity could not be found because some elements were still undiscovered, and thus he believed these elements that were still undiscovered would have properties that could be deduced from the expected relationships with other elements. In 1870, he first tried to characterize the yet undiscovered elements, and he gave detailed [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|predictions]] for three elements, which he termed eka-boron, eka-aluminium, and eka-silicium. In 1871, he expanded his predictions further as well as named a few more elements, although he noted that the principles described for those three elements can be used to describe other missing elements, noting that he wouldn't for that reason describe the elements himself.{{Efn|1=Those elements Mendeleev explicitly mentioned, saying he would be most interested to see them discovered were: eka-caesium, dvi-caesium, eka-niobium, eka-tantalum, eka-manganese, tri-manganese, as well as a \"the entire ninth row and even almost a whole big period (starting with Ce = 140)\".}}\n\nCompared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev's 1869 list misplaces seven then-known elements: [[indium]], [[thorium]] and the five rare earths \u2014 [[yttrium]], [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], erbium, and [[didymium]] (the latter two were later found to be mixtures of different elements); ignoring those would allow to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight. These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights.{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|p=159}} Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by a half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]).{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|pp=174\u2013175}} Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. \n\nMendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]] with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements,  which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew was is now called [[tungsten]]).<ref name=\"scimag19\">{{cite journal|last=Cheisson|first=T.|last2=Schelter|first2=E.

These radioactive elements (termed \"radioelements\") were accordingly placed at the bottom of the periodic table, as they were known to have greater atomic weights than stable elements, although their exact order was not known. Researchers believed there were still more radioactive elements yet to be discovered, and during the next decade, the [[decay chain#Actinide alpha decay chain|decay chain]]s of thorium and uranium were extensively studied. Many new radioactive substances were found, including the noble gas [[radon]], and their chemical properties were investigated.{{r|ley196610}} By 1912, almost 50 different radioactive substances had been found in the decay chains of thorium and uranium. American chemist [[Bertram Boltwood]] proposed several decay chains linking these radioelements between uranium and lead.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here. Another thing to be mentioned (probably) here is the emergence of the 18=column table -->In 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2\u00b71<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>).

Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93).

From left to right: Yzma, Kronk, Kuzco (in llama form), and Pacha.]]\nThe following are fictional characters from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s 2000 animated film ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', its [[direct-to-video]] sequel ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'', and the spin-off television series ''[[The Emperor's New School]]''.\n\n==Kuzco==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5999F0\n| name        = Emperor Kuzco\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = '''''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''''' (2000)\n| creator     = [[Mark Dindal]] <br>[[Roger Allers]] (original character from ''Kingdom of the Sun'')\n| lbl1 = Voiced by\n| data1 = [[David Spade]] (films, video games; movie stock footage)<br>[[J.

For example, when he is shown beautiful girls in hopes one of them will be his wife, he rudely insults all of them and continues to sing about himself and be pampered by his servants. His name is a reference to the ancient Incan city of [[Cusco]]. Throughout the series, he turns into various [[animal]]s.\n\nIn ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', Kuzco is turned into a [[llama]] by the malevolent [[#Yzma|Yzma]], following her termination as his adviser. He is presumed dead, and finds himself lost in the jungle. Kuzco teams up with [[#Pacha|Pacha]], a llama herder, who helps Kuzco turn back into a human again, regaining his humility and his throne. Kuzco learns the meaning of [[friendship]] and generosity throughout the film.\n\nIn ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'', Kuzco plays a significantly smaller role. He occasionally shows up onscreen acting as if he's the director and breaks the [[fourth wall]] by talking to the audience. He admits he has changed: \"I'm nice now. Didn't you see the first movie?\" However, he remains arrogant; near the end of the film, he shows up in women's clothing, claiming he is [[#Kronk|Kronk]]'s wife, announcing, \"You like how I weaseled my way into this movie?\"\n\nIn ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'', to remain emperor, Kuzco must to go to Kuzco Academy, a school he instituted and financed; He must pass all his classes, but Yzma and Kronk are out to make sure he fails. If he fails even one class, he will not be emperor, and Yzma will take over the empire. In the series Kuzco develops a love interest named [[#Malina|Malina]].\n\nIn the episode \"Father O Mine,\" Kuzco's real father appears in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]. He is a strong, muscular man, and was emperor before Kuzco. According to Kuzco and Yzma, he was lost at sea on a trip when Kuzco was just a baby; thereby granting the throne to Kuzco. It is revealed that Kuzco and his father share two things: a llama birthmark and the same necklace. In another episode, it is revealed that Kuzco has a fear of frogs after a traumatic childhood experience with them as a baby. In another, it is discovered that Kuzco's favorite food is Mudka's Meat Mug which is the only thing he orders. In \"Graduation Groove\", Kuzco completed school and got to be emperor again; having grown attached to Pacha's family, he lets them move into the palace with him. Kuzco and Malina also become an official couple and are seen going on a date together.\n\n=== Other Appearances ===\nKuzco commonly appears at [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]], just like other Disney characters. He also occasionally appears at [[Disney's House of Mouse|House Of Mouse]].\n\n==Pacha==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5999F0\n| name        = Pacha\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = '''''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''''' (2000)\n| creator     = [[Mark Dindal]] <br>[[Roger Allers]] (original character from ''Kingdom of the Sun'')\n| lbl1 = Voiced by\n| data1 = [[John Goodman]] (films, TV series; Season 2)<br>[[Fred Tatasciore]] (TV series; Season 1)<br>[[Bill Farmer]] (video game)\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\n'''Pacha''' is a portly farmer from the countryside of the Incas. He was a character added during the production process that completely revamped the story.  The original role to assist emperor-turned-llama Kuzco was to be female, and a potential love interest for the cold-hearted teen.  The major overhaul of story made the film a [[Buddy film|buddy movie]], with Pacha and Kuzco having to work through the adventure together. His name is possibly a reference to Incan emperor [[Pachacuti]].\n\nPacha is a laid-back [[peasant]] and family man, and a subject in the egotistic Emperor [[Kuzco]]'s kingdom. His bravery, kindness, and value of both [[friendship]] and [[family]] helps Kuzco change into a friendly and accommodating young man. Pacha is married to Chicha, who is pregnant with Yupi when first seen. During the time of the first movie they have two children: their daughter, Chaca, and their younger son Tipo. Yupi is born before the movie's final scene and appears in all spin-off material.\n\nIn ''The Emperor's New Groove'', Pacha is summoned to the palace by [[Kuzco]] and is told that his house on the hill will be destroyed to make room for Kuzco's summer home. Surprised and appalled that the emperor could be so careless, he travels home to tell Chicha and his two children (Chaca and Tipo) that they have to leave their ancestral home. However, before he can tell them, he discovers that Kuzco has been transformed into a [[llama]] and dropped in the back of his cart. He is initially reluctant to help Kuzco, since the emperor seems to make it clear that he still intends to destroy Pacha's village. Over time, however, Pacha gradually helps Kuzco to start thinking of people other than himself, and he eventually cleans up his act. The two set out to turn Kuzco back to a human by getting to [[Yzma]]'s lab. Upon returning to being human, Kuzco lets Pacha keep his village and even spends his summer vacation with Pacha's family.\n\nIn ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'', the story revolves around [[#Kronk|Kronk]], but Pacha is one of Kronk's friends. In one scene he disguises himself as \"Pachita\", Kronk's mother-in-law. He was once again voiced by Goodman.\n\nIn ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'', he continues his fatherly role to Kuzco and lets the young emperor-to-be live with him and his family while Kuzco goes to school. He always gives Kuzco advice to help him out of any situation. For example, when Kuzco was transformed into a rabbit, he told Kuzco to \"Make the best of what you've got,\" which in this case was speed. As a result of the events of the original film, Kuzco and Pacha share an attachment as both friends and surrogate father and son.\n\nIn the series Pacha's voice acting was taken over by [[Fred Tatasciore]], and then again by Goodman later in the series.\n\n==Yzma==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5999F0\n| name        = Yzma\n| image       = \n| caption     = Yzma in \"''The Emperor's New School''\"\n| first       = '''''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''''' (2000)\n| last        = \n| creator     = [[Mark Dindal]] <br>[[Roger Allers]] (original character from ''Kingdom of the Sun'')\n| lbl1 = Voiced by\n| data1 = [[Eartha Kitt]] (films, TV series, video game)<br>[[Grey DeLisle]] (as Yasmin)<br>[[Candi Milo]] (after Kitt's death)<br>Mark Dindal (as a cat)\n| alias       = Principal Amzy\nNurse Mazy\n| noinfo = yes\n| family = Momma Azma (mother)\n| children    = Zevon and Yzla (Descendants)\n| relatives = Zim (nephew)<br>Zam (nephew)\n}}\n'''Yzma''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|i\u02d0|z|m|\u0259}} is Kuzco's primary parental guardian and advisor. In the [[English language|English]] version, she was voiced by [[Eartha Kitt]], who received three [[Annie Awards]] and two [[Emmy]] Awards for the role.\n\nYzma's character in the series is seen to be cruel, but comically eccentric, often calling herself beautiful even though all other characters in the series consider her appearance \"scary beyond all reason\". She is intelligent and comes up with grandiose plans and schemes with a set objective in mind, but fails to pay attention to the minor details of it. More often than not, such neglect causes the scheme to backfire on her. Yzma is seen to possess vast knowledge in [[alchemy]], as she accidentally uses extract of llama on Kuzco, thinking that it was poison. In the first film, [[#Kronk|Kronk]] states that she should re-label her potions, because everything she makes in her \"secret lab\" has exactly the same pinkish color. It is implied that Yzma practices [[Black magic|magic]], but this is never shown. She is portrayed as more of a [[mad scientist]], though she claims to be a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorceress]].\n\nOriginally serving as the Emperor Kuzco's advisor, she is later fired after meddling in his affairs and attempting to act as Empress in his absence. Furious at her termination, Yzma conspires with her assistant Kronk to assassinate Kuzco. The two head to the \"secret lab\"\u2014which apparently everybody already knows about\u2014to concoct a plan to harm Kuzco. The film producers have stated that she is a complicated thinker; an example given with her original plan to kill Emperor Kuzco. The plan involved her turning him into a flea, putting him in a box, putting that box into another box and then mailing that box to herself only to smash it with a hammer. But after thinking it over (and partially because she knocked over some poison onto a plant), she decides to save on postage and simply poison him. The concept of her formulating a nonsensical plan before settling on an easier-to-pull-off idea (always a potion) would later be used as a [[running gag]] on the series.<ref>In the commentary on the ''Emperor's New Groove'' DVD</ref>\n\nYzma also appears in the direct-to-DVD sequel ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]''. During the first half of the film, she sells [[Placebo|sewer sludge]] to the old people, telling them that it is a youth potion, but once Kronk finds out her potion is a fake, the old people chase her down, where she uses a potion to transform herself into a rabbit, to prevent them from attacking her. She is then immediately carried off by a large bird of prey. At the end of the movie, in a nest outside the restaurant, Yzma (still in rabbit form) witnesses the bird's chicks hatch but they immediately reveal themselves to be viciously carnivorous and prepare to attack Yzma, who screams for dear life. Her appearance in the television series implies that she survived this situation.\n\nIn ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'', Yzma constantly plots to get Kuzco to fail his classes at Kuzco Academy, allowing her to become empress; to this end, she poses as Amzy (her first name spelled backwards), the principal of Kuzco Academy. Kronk is constantly fooled by her disguise, but Kuzco knows it's her. Her plans mainly consist of transforming Kuzco into different animals to foil his attempts to pass a class, though they often work to his advantage. In the episode \"Monster Masquerade\", Yzma takes a [[cobra]] form similar to Jafar's from the Disney film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. In \u201cGraduation Groove\u201d, the series finale, Yzma is demoted to Kronk's secretary for firing him earlier in the episode.\n\nYzma shares many of Kuzco's negative traits including arrogance, unreliability and [[narcissism]]. Some of Yzma's known relatives appear at times in the series. They include her twin nephews, [[Zim and Zam]], (voiced by [[Dylan and Cole Sprouse]]) who appear in \"Chipmunky Business\", and her mother Azma, (voiced by [[Ellen Albertini Dow]]) who appears in \"The Bride of Kuzco\" and appears just as frail as Yzma (possibly even more so) and converses by sighs and coughs. In one episode, Yzma remarks that her plots to destroy Kuzco are primarily due to her mother constantly nagging her. A [[running gag]] throughout the show is that Yzma is often referred to as, and mistaken for, a [[dinosaur]] (a reference to the first movie, in which Kuzco states that she is \"living proof that dinosaurs once roamed the Earth\"). In one episode, he also calls her a wrinklesaurous and old dinosaur.\n\n===In Pop Culture===\nIn the animated series, ''[[Descendants: Wicked World]],'' it's revealed that she has a son named Zevon, played by [[Bradley Steven Perry]].\n\n==Kronk==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5999F0\n| name        = Kronk\n| image       = \n| caption     = Kronk in \"''The Emperor's New School''\"\n| first       = '''''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''''' (2000)\n| creator     = [[Mark Dindal]]\n| lbl1 = Voiced by\n| data1 = [[Patrick Warburton]]\n| alias = Nurse Kronk<br> Principal Kronk (or Knork)\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\n'''Kronk Pepikrankenitz'''<ref>His last name is revealed in ''The Emperor's New School'' episode, \"Clash of the Families.\"</ref> is the 28-year old muscular henchman of [[#Yzma|Yzma]], the royal adviser to Emperor Kuzco from ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''. He also starred as in his own film, ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'', and is a recurring character in the TV series, ''[[The Emperor's New School]]''.  Kronk is the most recurring of all recurring characters in the franchise, serving as the franchise's comic relief (even breaking the [[fourth wall]] now and then); and in all of his appearances, he is voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]]. Like [[Homer Simpson]], he is quite knowledgeable, but his moments of knowledge are often overshadowed by slow wit (his defining trait, and an irritation to Kuzco and Yzma).\n\nDespite working for the villain Yzma, he is surprisingly courteous and patient. Whenever he faces a moral dilemma, smaller versions of Kronk, his [[shoulder angel]] and devil, appear, but they usually bicker and mock one another instead of helping Kronk with the problem at hand.\n\nHe is revealed to be a great [[Cooking|cook]] who can make such things as spinach puffs and [[fondue]], and also has a secret recipe for [[foie gras]]. He also knows a variety of recipes and kitchen slang, as revealed in first film when he takes over for the chef. He is capable of incredible superhuman athletics, such as running from a school to his house and back in mere seconds, and climbing a mountain (while having a seat tied to his body with Yzma riding atop). Through the animated series, it is learned that Kronk comes from a family of athletic health and fitness advocates. It was revealed in the episode of ''The Emperor's New School'' \"Oops, All Doodles\" that Kronk has a talent for drawing. In addition, Kronk is shown to be [[Judaism|Jewish]]; in the film ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'', he fantasizes about marrying Miss Birdwell in a Jewish ceremony, complete with him stepping on a glass.\n\nIn ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', Kronk is [[Yzma]]'s henchman, and helps her turn [[Kuzco]] into a [[llama]]. He almost throws Kuzco over a [[waterfall]], but has a change of heart and drops him on [[Pacha (The Emperor's New Groove)|Pacha]]'s cart instead of killing him by accident. When he reveals his failure, Kronk then helps Yzma find him. He is shown as a sympathetic character through Yzma's mistreatment of him and his ability to \"speak [[Squirrel]].\"\n\nHe stars in the spin-off-ish sequel, starting as head chef and owner of a restaurant called Mudka's. He is happy with his new position, rather than his position with Yzma. However, Yzma eventually tricks him into helping her with a fake \"youth potion\" to con money out of elderly villagers. He develops a love interest, named Birdwell, and his father, Papi (voiced by [[John Mahoney]]) is introduced.\n\nIn the animated television series, Kronk plays the role of hero, villain, sidekick of (n)either side, or a combination of these roles in varying episodes. He is Yzma's henchman and also Kuzco's classmate and close friend. Though he frequently helps Yzma with her schemes, he just as often helps Kuzco out of them. As a running gag, he can never remember that Principal Amzy is really Yzma, and as a result, thinks he is in trouble when Yzma calls for him (In the last episode, he tells Yzma how obvious her disguise is, but when asked how long he has known, he replies \"About three episodes back.\"). Another running gag revolves around Kronk attempting to activate access to the secret lab, as originated from the original film with the secret lab's access procedure: more often than not, he constantly pulls the wrong one, and as a result Yzma constantly gets booby-trapped before fixing the error. In a rather fitting irony of the show's outcome, Kuzco appoints Kronk as his new advisor (since he sometimes gives thoughtful, eloquent advice), while Yzma is made Kronk's assistant.\n\n==Other characters==\n*'''Chicha''': Pacha's protective wife. Throughout most of the first film, she is heavily pregnant with her third child, Yupi, who is born before the final scene. She was voiced by [[Wendie Malick]].\n*'''Chaca''' and '''Tipo''': Pacha and Chicha's children, who constantly try to one-up each other and compete for their father's attentions. Chaca is a little 7-year-old<ref name=\"groove\">Mentioned in ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]''.</ref> girl, has [[pigtail]]s, a yellow shawl and a red skirt with her bellybutton showing up. Her name is not mentioned in the first film, though. Her younger brother is Tipo, who is a 5-year-old.<ref name=\"groove\"/> In their first film, he has a [[nightmare]] about Kuzco and Pacha tied to the log in a vine. In ''Kronk's New Groove'', they join Kronk's Junior Chipmunks at Camp Chippamunka. They were respectively voiced by Kellyann Kelso and Eli Russell Linnetz, and Jessie Flower and [[Shaun Baumel]] in later appearances.\n*'''Matta''': the waitress at Mudka's Meat Hut. In ''The Emperor's New School'', she is Kuzco Academy's lunch lady. Matta likes to cook weird stuff such as octopus burgers, and speaks in cafeteria speech when she talks. She was voiced by [[Patti Deutsch]].\n*'''Rudy''': is an old man who first appears accidentally interrupting Kuzco's \"groove\", for which he is thrown out a window. He warns Pacha about this, and Kuzco apologizes to him at the end of the film, which he accepts with good grace. In ''Kronk's New Groove'', Rudy and his friends from the old folks' home are tricked by Yzma, who sells them sewer slime as a youth potion. They have to sell their home to pay for it, but Kronk gives them their home back. Rudy was voiced by [[John Fiedler]] and currently by [[Travis Oates]].\n*'''Bucky''': a [[squirrel]] whom Kuzco first encounters; after Kuzco is rude to him, Bucky attempts to wake the [[black jaguar]]s by popping a [[balloon modelling|balloon llama]], but when he fails, Kuzco accidentally wakes them himself. Bucky later tells Kronk and Yzma which way Kuzco went, and appears in the final scene as Kronk's helper in teaching squirrel talking. Bucky makes various appearances in ''The Emperor's New School''. He was Kuzco's tutor in the episode \"Squeakend at Bucky's\". Bucky was voiced by [[Bob Bergen]] in all of his appearances.\n*'''Miss Birdwell''': Kronk's love interest in ''Kronk's New Groove''. Like Kronk, Birdwell is a camp counselor. When Tipo pulls a prank to win the camp championships and is caught, Kronk protects the boy at the cost of alienating his love. However, at the end of the film, Tipo reunites them and Kronk wins Birdwell's love. In the credits, it is hinted that the two got married. She was voiced by [[Tracey Ullman]].\n*'''Papi''': Kronk's father. Though he has few appearances in ''Kronk's New Groove'', he is instrumental to the plot of the film as Kronk is always trying to get Papi's approval. He was voiced by [[John Mahoney]]. In ''The Emperor's New School'' episode, \"Clash of the Families,\" Papi makes a return appearance, this time voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]].\n\n==Introduced in ''The Emperor's New School''==\n\n===Malina===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour  = #5999F0\n| name    = Malina\n| image   = \n| caption = \n| first   = '''''[[The Emperor's New School]]'''''\n| creator = [[Mark Dindal]]\n| lbl1 = Voiced by\n| data1 = [[Jessica DiCicco]]\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\n'''Malina''' is the only major character from that series that has not previously appeared in either ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' or ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]''. She is Kuzco's good friend and love interest. However, he has a not-so-secret crush on her (he often calls her \"a hottie hot hottie\" or \" the hottiest hot hottie in hottie-ville\").\n\nMalina is a [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]] and the school council president who also is very smart. She prints the Academy's [[newspaper|news scroll]] (which later leads her to be a reporter of the Kuzconian Times). She is a straight-A+ student, which is apparently a requirement for the cheerleading squad (a twist to most stereotypical \"airheaded\" cheerleaders). She is driven to excel almost to the point of having a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] if she does not do everything perfectly perfect (a prime example of a [[Type A personality]]), and has a very moral mindset which the show uses as a foil against Kuzco's [[slacker]] life-choices.\n\nMalina also has an incredibly strong sense of winning every contest she enters by any means, which first appeared in the episode \"The Emperor's New Tuber\" in which Malina was determined to fill all the spots on the Whack-A-Weasel arcade game on the high score board with her name (the last person on the list was [[Yzma]]). Also, both her devil and angel sides encouraged her to cheat in the potato growing contest despite her angel side was supposed to \"tell her not to do it\", in which she responded that she was not about to lose her perfect record.\n\nIn the second season, Malina shows that she is not as perfect as most people think. For example, she is sometimes headstrong, and shows greed, mentioned by Kuzco in the episode \"Gold Fool's\". Malina is also very strict and has a serious face referred to as 'The Stare' by Kuzco and Kronk. In \"Oops, All Doodles\", it is revealed that Malina's doodles are drawn in a [[super deformed]] [[anime]]-style. Malina is also set with a challenge before her: get Kuzco to do the right thing. She tries to reason with him about cheating, being selfish, not thinking of others and superstitions that make no sense. Malina mentors Kuzco because she wants to help him graduate and learn how to become a good emperor.\n\nMalina is the smart side of her group of friends. She always has to show Kuzco the correct decision to take (though he rarely listens). Malina seems to know what Kuzco is thinking, as she has commented on what he was saying in his head multiple times. She is incredibly observant, as she is instantly and accurately able to figure out many of Kuzco's wrongdoings despite not witnessing them herself. As shown in the episode \"The Mystery of Machu Picchu\", she has a pink [[rabbit]] stuffed animal, named Floopy, similar to Kuzco's 'Wompy.'(Malina: I always take her on trips. She makes me feel safe. Kuzco: Malina gone loco.) At the end of the episode, it shows a picture of Kuzco, Malina, Wompy, and Floopy. In the episode \"The Emperor's New Musical\" at the end Kuzco and Malina kiss. She makes the comment, \"Wow\", although she claims it was just acting.\n\nAt the end of the episode \"Working Girl\" after she got fired from Mudkas so Yatta can get re-hired with help from Kuzco she asks him on a date but he can't go because he ate too much food at Mudkas so he can talk to her and ended up having a sick moment.\n\nShe often also uses Kuzco's crush to get him to do the right thing. It has been proved that Malina likes Kuzco, for example in one episode, she seems to look forward to a date with Kuzco that she had accepted reluctantly; in the episode \"The Emperor's New Musical,\" she admitted that she was beginning to genuinely like him. In \"Everybody Loves Kuzco,\" after Kuzco was infected with a cutie potion, the two went on an actual date; afterward, she came on to him and got ditched by Kuzco. In \"Come Fly With Me,\" while Kuzco was spying on Malina, she does admit that she has feelings for him, but his personality annoys her at times and is why she helps him to change. In \"Too Many Malinas\" Kuzco uses Yzma's machine to get rid of Malina's annoying traits. One of those traits was \"Smochy Malina\" whom Kuzco dates with. At the end she says that she loves Kuzco but he doesn't notice.\n\nLater in \"Auction Action,\" Kuzco uses Yatta to make Malina, successfully, jealous. She in turn uses Kronk. Later in the episode, during an argument between the two, she admits again that she does like Kuzco, much to her own chagrin as she then lowers her head stating \"Oh no, I can't believe I just told him that.\" In \"Kuzcokazooza\" It is stated that she does like Kuzco but is disappointed that he does not think about others. Also in this episode, she gets jealous when she thinks he has a girlfriend. In the final episode of the series, at the end she goes on a date with Kuzco straight after he is made emperor and happily becomes his girlfriend.\n\n===Minor characters===\nThe following is a list of minor characters from ''[[The Emperor's New School]]''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n|-\n!

For example, when he is shown beautiful girls in hopes one of them will be his wife, he rudely insults all of them and continues to sing about himself and be pampered by his servants. His name is a reference to the ancient Incan city of [[Cusco]]. Throughout the series, he turns into various [[animal]]s.\n\nIn ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', Kuzco is turned into a [[llama]] by the malevolent [[#Yzma|Yzma]], following her termination as his adviser. He is presumed dead, and finds himself lost in the jungle. Kuzco teams up with [[#Pacha|Pacha]], a llama herder, who helps Kuzco turn back into a human again, regaining his humility and his throne. Kuzco learns the meaning of [[friendship]] and generosity throughout the film.\n\nIn ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'', Kuzco plays a significantly smaller role. He occasionally shows up onscreen acting as if he's the director and breaks the [[fourth wall]] by talking to the audience. He admits he has changed: \"I'm nice now. Didn't you see the first movie?\" However, he remains arrogant; near the end of the film, he shows up in women's clothing, claiming he is [[#Kronk|Kronk]]'s wife, announcing, \"You like how I weaseled my way into this movie?\"\n\nIn ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'', to remain emperor, Kuzco must to go to Kuzco Academy, a school he instituted and financed; He must pass all his classes, but Yzma and Kronk are out to make sure he fails. If he fails even one class, he will not be emperor, and Yzma will take over the empire. In the series Kuzco develops a love interest named [[#Malina|Malina]].\n\nIn the episode \"Father O Mine,\" Kuzco's real father appears in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]. He is a strong, muscular man, and was emperor before Kuzco. According to Kuzco and Yzma, he was lost at sea on a trip when Kuzco was just a baby; thereby granting the throne to Kuzco. It is revealed that Kuzco and his father share two things: a llama birthmark and the same necklace. In another episode, it is revealed that Kuzco has a fear of frogs after a traumatic childhood experience with them as a baby. In another, it is discovered that Kuzco's favorite food is Mudka's Meat Mug which is the only thing he orders. In \"Graduation Groove\", Kuzco completed school and got to be emperor again; having grown attached to Pacha's family, he lets them move into the palace with him. Kuzco and Malina also become an official couple and are seen going on a date together.\n\n=== Other Appearances ===\nKuzco commonly appears at [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Parks]], just like other Disney characters. He also occasionally appears at [[Disney's House of Mouse|House Of Mouse]].\n\n==Pacha==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5999F0\n| name        = Pacha\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| first       = '''''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''''' (2000)\n| creator     = [[Mark Dindal]] <br>[[Roger Allers]] (original character from ''Kingdom of the Sun'')\n| lbl1 = Voiced by\n| data1 = [[John Goodman]] (films, TV series; Season 2)<br>[[Fred Tatasciore]] (TV series; Season 1)<br>[[Bill Farmer]] (video game)\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\n'''Pacha''' is a portly farmer from the countryside of the Incas. He was a character added during the production process that completely revamped the story.  The original role to assist emperor-turned-llama Kuzco was to be female, and a potential love interest for the cold-hearted teen.  The major overhaul of story made the film a [[Buddy film|buddy movie]], with Pacha and Kuzco having to work through the adventure together. His name is possibly a reference to Incan emperor [[Pachacuti]].\n\nPacha is a laid-back [[peasant]] and family man, and a subject in the egotistic Emperor [[Kuzco]]'s kingdom. His bravery, kindness, and value of both [[friendship]] and [[family]] helps Kuzco change into a friendly and accommodating young man. Pacha is married to Chicha, who is pregnant with Yupi when first seen. During the time of the first movie they have two children: their daughter, Chaca, and their younger son Tipo. Yupi is born before the movie's final scene and appears in all spin-off material.\n\nIn ''The Emperor's New Groove'', Pacha is summoned to the palace by [[Kuzco]] and is told that his house on the hill will be destroyed to make room for Kuzco's summer home. Surprised and appalled that the emperor could be so careless, he travels home to tell Chicha and his two children (Chaca and Tipo) that they have to leave their ancestral home. However, before he can tell them, he discovers that Kuzco has been transformed into a [[llama]] and dropped in the back of his cart. He is initially reluctant to help Kuzco, since the emperor seems to make it clear that he still intends to destroy Pacha's village. Over time, however, Pacha gradually helps Kuzco to start thinking of people other than himself, and he eventually cleans up his act. The two set out to turn Kuzco back to a human by getting to [[Yzma]]'s lab. Upon returning to being human, Kuzco lets Pacha keep his village and even spends his summer vacation with Pacha's family.\n\nIn ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'', the story revolves around [[#Kronk|Kronk]], but Pacha is one of Kronk's friends. In one scene he disguises himself as \"Pachita\", Kronk's mother-in-law. He was once again voiced by Goodman.\n\nIn ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'', he continues his fatherly role to Kuzco and lets the young emperor-to-be live with him and his family while Kuzco goes to school. He always gives Kuzco advice to help him out of any situation. For example, when Kuzco was transformed into a rabbit, he told Kuzco to \"Make the best of what you've got,\" which in this case was speed. As a result of the events of the original film, Kuzco and Pacha share an attachment as both friends and surrogate father and son.\n\nIn the series Pacha's voice acting was taken over by [[Fred Tatasciore]], and then again by Goodman later in the series.\n\n==Yzma==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5999F0\n| name        = Yzma\n| image       = \n| caption     = Yzma in \"''The Emperor's New School''\"\n| first       = '''''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''''' (2000)\n| last        = \n| creator     = [[Mark Dindal]] <br>[[Roger Allers]] (original character from ''Kingdom of the Sun'')\n| lbl1 = Voiced by\n| data1 = [[Eartha Kitt]] (films, TV series, video game)<br>[[Grey DeLisle]] (as Yasmin)<br>[[Candi Milo]] (after Kitt's death)<br>Mark Dindal (as a cat)\n| alias       = Principal Amzy\nNurse Mazy\n| noinfo = yes\n| family = Momma Azma (mother)\n| children    = Zevon and Yzla (Descendants)\n| relatives = Zim (nephew)<br>Zam (nephew)\n}}\n'''Yzma''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|i\u02d0|z|m|\u0259}} is Kuzco's primary parental guardian and advisor. In the [[English language|English]] version, she was voiced by [[Eartha Kitt]], who received three [[Annie Awards]] and two [[Emmy]] Awards for the role.\n\nYzma's character in the series is seen to be cruel, but comically eccentric, often calling herself beautiful even though all other characters in the series consider her appearance \"scary beyond all reason\". She is intelligent and comes up with grandiose plans and schemes with a set objective in mind, but fails to pay attention to the minor details of it. More often than not, such neglect causes the scheme to backfire on her. Yzma is seen to possess vast knowledge in [[alchemy]], as she accidentally uses extract of llama on Kuzco, thinking that it was poison. In the first film, [[#Kronk|Kronk]] states that she should re-label her potions, because everything she makes in her \"secret lab\" has exactly the same pinkish color. It is implied that Yzma practices [[Black magic|magic]], but this is never shown. She is portrayed as more of a [[mad scientist]], though she claims to be a [[Magician (fantasy)|sorceress]].\n\nOriginally serving as the Emperor Kuzco's advisor, she is later fired after meddling in his affairs and attempting to act as Empress in his absence. Furious at her termination, Yzma conspires with her assistant Kronk to assassinate Kuzco. The two head to the \"secret lab\"\u2014which apparently everybody already knows about\u2014to concoct a plan to harm Kuzco. The film producers have stated that she is a complicated thinker; an example given with her original plan to kill Emperor Kuzco. The plan involved her turning him into a flea, putting him in a box, putting that box into another box and then mailing that box to herself only to smash it with a hammer. But after thinking it over (and partially because she knocked over some poison onto a plant), she decides to save on postage and simply poison him. The concept of her formulating a nonsensical plan before settling on an easier-to-pull-off idea (always a potion) would later be used as a [[running gag]] on the series.<ref>In the commentary on the ''Emperor's New Groove'' DVD</ref>\n\nYzma also appears in the direct-to-DVD sequel ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]''. During the first half of the film, she sells [[Placebo|sewer sludge]] to the old people, telling them that it is a youth potion, but once Kronk finds out her potion is a fake, the old people chase her down, where she uses a potion to transform herself into a rabbit, to prevent them from attacking her. She is then immediately carried off by a large bird of prey. At the end of the movie, in a nest outside the restaurant, Yzma (still in rabbit form) witnesses the bird's chicks hatch but they immediately reveal themselves to be viciously carnivorous and prepare to attack Yzma, who screams for dear life. Her appearance in the television series implies that she survived this situation.\n\nIn ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'', Yzma constantly plots to get Kuzco to fail his classes at Kuzco Academy, allowing her to become empress; to this end, she poses as Amzy (her first name spelled backwards), the principal of Kuzco Academy. Kronk is constantly fooled by her disguise, but Kuzco knows it's her. Her plans mainly consist of transforming Kuzco into different animals to foil his attempts to pass a class, though they often work to his advantage. In the episode \"Monster Masquerade\", Yzma takes a [[cobra]] form similar to Jafar's from the Disney film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''. In \u201cGraduation Groove\u201d, the series finale, Yzma is demoted to Kronk's secretary for firing him earlier in the episode.\n\nYzma shares many of Kuzco's negative traits including arrogance, unreliability and [[narcissism]]. Some of Yzma's known relatives appear at times in the series. They include her twin nephews, [[Zim and Zam]], (voiced by [[Dylan and Cole Sprouse]]) who appear in \"Chipmunky Business\", and her mother Azma, (voiced by [[Ellen Albertini Dow]]) who appears in \"The Bride of Kuzco\" and appears just as frail as Yzma (possibly even more so) and converses by sighs and coughs. In one episode, Yzma remarks that her plots to destroy Kuzco are primarily due to her mother constantly nagging her. A [[running gag]] throughout the show is that Yzma is often referred to as, and mistaken for, a [[dinosaur]] (a reference to the first movie, in which Kuzco states that she is \"living proof that dinosaurs once roamed the Earth\"). In one episode, he also calls her a wrinklesaurous and old dinosaur.\n\n===In Pop Culture===\nIn the animated series, ''[[Descendants: Wicked World]],'' it's revealed that she has a son named Zevon, played by [[Bradley Steven Perry]].\n\n==Kronk==\n{{Infobox character\n| colour      = #5999F0\n| name        = Kronk\n| image       = \n| caption     = Kronk in \"''The Emperor's New School''\"\n| first       = '''''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''''' (2000)\n| creator     = [[Mark Dindal]]\n| lbl1 = Voiced by\n| data1 = [[Patrick Warburton]]\n| alias = Nurse Kronk<br> Principal Kronk (or Knork)\n| noinfo = yes\n}}\n'''Kronk Pepikrankenitz'''<ref>His last name is revealed in ''The Emperor's New School'' episode, \"Clash of the Families.\"</ref> is the 28-year old muscular henchman of [[#Yzma|Yzma]], the royal adviser to Emperor Kuzco from ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]''. He also starred as in his own film, ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'', and is a recurring character in the TV series, ''[[The Emperor's New School]]''.  Kronk is the most recurring of all recurring characters in the franchise, serving as the franchise's comic relief (even breaking the fourth wall now and then); and in all of his appearances, he is voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]]. Like [[Homer Simpson]], he is quite knowledgeable, but his moments of knowledge are often overshadowed by slow wit (his defining trait, and an irritation to Kuzco and Yzma).\n\nDespite working for the villain Yzma, he is surprisingly courteous and patient. Whenever he faces a moral dilemma, smaller versions of Kronk, his [[shoulder angel]] and devil, appear, but they usually bicker and mock one another instead of helping Kronk with the problem at hand.\n\nHe is revealed to be a great [[Cooking|cook]] who can make such things as spinach puffs and [[fondue]], and also has a secret recipe for [[foie gras]]. He also knows a variety of recipes and kitchen slang, as revealed in first film when he takes over for the chef. He is capable of incredible superhuman athletics, such as running from a school to his house and back in mere seconds, and climbing a mountain (while having a seat tied to his body with Yzma riding atop). Through the animated series, it is learned that Kronk comes from a family of athletic health and fitness advocates. It was revealed in the episode of ''The Emperor's New School'' \"Oops, All Doodles\" that Kronk has a talent for drawing. In addition, Kronk is shown to be [[Judaism|Jewish]]; in the film ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'', he fantasizes about marrying Miss Birdwell in a Jewish ceremony, complete with him stepping on a glass.\n\nIn ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', Kronk is [[Yzma]]'s henchman, and helps her turn [[Kuzco]] into a [[llama]]. He almost throws Kuzco over a [[waterfall]], but has a change of heart and drops him on [[Pacha (The Emperor's New Groove)|Pacha]]'s cart instead of killing him by accident. When he reveals his failure, Kronk then helps Yzma find him. He is shown as a sympathetic character through Yzma's mistreatment of him and his ability to \"speak [[Squirrel]].\"\n\nHe stars in the spin-off-ish sequel, starting as head chef and owner of a restaurant called Mudka's. He is happy with his new position, rather than his position with Yzma. However, Yzma eventually tricks him into helping her with a fake \"youth potion\" to con money out of elderly villagers. He develops a love interest, named Birdwell, and his father, Papi (voiced by [[John Mahoney]]) is introduced.\n\nIn the animated television series, Kronk plays the role of hero, villain, sidekick of (n)either side, or a combination of these roles in varying episodes. He is Yzma's henchman and also Kuzco's classmate and close friend. Though he frequently helps Yzma with her schemes, he just as often helps Kuzco out of them. As a running gag, he can never remember that Principal Amzy is really Yzma, and as a result, thinks he is in trouble when Yzma calls for him (In the last episode, he tells Yzma how obvious her disguise is, but when asked how long he has known, he replies \"About three episodes back.\"). Another running gag revolves around Kronk attempting to activate access to the secret lab, as originated from the original film with the secret lab's access procedure: more often than not, he constantly pulls the wrong one, and as a result Yzma constantly gets booby-trapped before fixing the error. In a rather fitting irony of the show's outcome, Kuzco appoints Kronk as his new advisor (since he sometimes gives thoughtful, eloquent advice), while Yzma is made Kronk's assistant.\n\n==Other characters==\n*'''Chicha''': Pacha's protective wife. Throughout most of the first film, she is heavily pregnant with her third child, Yupi, who is born before the final scene. She was voiced by [[Wendie Malick]].\n*'''Chaca''' and '''Tipo''': Pacha and Chicha's children, who constantly try to one-up each other and compete for their father's attentions.

She is Kuzco's good friend and love interest. However, he has a not-so-secret crush on her (he often calls her \"a hottie hot hottie\" or \" the hottiest hot hottie in hottie-ville\").\n\nMalina is a [[Cheerleading|cheerleader]] and the school council president who also is very smart. She prints the Academy's [[newspaper|news scroll]] (which later leads her to be a reporter of the Kuzconian Times). She is a straight-A+ student, which is apparently a requirement for the cheerleading squad (a twist to most stereotypical \"airheaded\" cheerleaders). She is driven to excel almost to the point of having a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] if she does not do everything perfectly perfect (a prime example of a [[Type A personality]]), and has a very moral mindset which the show uses as a foil against Kuzco's [[slacker]] life-choices.\n\nMalina also has an incredibly strong sense of winning every contest she enters by any means, which first appeared in the episode \"The Emperor's New Tuber\" in which Malina was determined to fill all the spots on the Whack-A-Weasel arcade game on the high score board with her name (the last person on the list was [[Yzma]]). Also, both her devil and angel sides encouraged her to cheat in the potato growing contest despite her angel side was supposed to \"tell her not to do it\", in which she responded that she was not about to lose her perfect record.\n\nIn the second season, Malina shows that she is not as perfect as most people think. For example, she is sometimes headstrong, and shows greed, mentioned by Kuzco in the episode \"Gold Fool's\". Malina is also very strict and has a serious face referred to as 'The Stare' by Kuzco and Kronk. In \"Oops, All Doodles\", it is revealed that Malina's doodles are drawn in a [[super deformed]] [[anime]]-style. Malina is also set with a challenge before her: get Kuzco to do the right thing. She tries to reason with him about cheating, being selfish, not thinking of others and superstitions that make no sense. Malina mentors Kuzco because she wants to help him graduate and learn how to become a good emperor.\n\nMalina is the smart side of her group of friends. She always has to show Kuzco the correct decision to take (though he rarely listens). Malina seems to know what Kuzco is thinking, as she has commented on what he was saying in his head multiple times. She is incredibly observant, as she is instantly and accurately able to figure out many of Kuzco's wrongdoings despite not witnessing them herself. As shown in the episode \"The Mystery of Machu Picchu\", she has a pink [[rabbit]] stuffed animal, named Floopy, similar to Kuzco's 'Wompy.'(Malina: I always take her on trips. She makes me feel safe. Kuzco: Malina gone loco.) At the end of the episode, it shows a picture of Kuzco, Malina, Wompy, and Floopy. In the episode \"The Emperor's New Musical\" at the end Kuzco and Malina kiss. She makes the comment, \"Wow\", although she claims it was just acting.\n\nAt the end of the episode \"Working Girl\" after she got fired from Mudkas so Yatta can get re-hired with help from Kuzco she asks him on a date but he can't go because he ate too much food at Mudkas so he can talk to her and ended up having a sick moment.\n\nShe often also uses Kuzco's crush to get him to do the right thing. It has been proved that Malina likes Kuzco, for example in one episode, she seems to look forward to a date with Kuzco that she had accepted reluctantly; in the episode \"The Emperor's New Musical,\" she admitted that she was beginning to genuinely like him. In \"Everybody Loves Kuzco,\" after Kuzco was infected with a cutie potion, the two went on an actual date; afterward, she came on to him and got ditched by Kuzco. In \"Come Fly With Me,\" while Kuzco was spying on Malina, she does admit that she has feelings for him, but his personality annoys her at times and is why she helps him to change. In \"Too Many Malinas\" Kuzco uses Yzma's machine to get rid of Malina's annoying traits. One of those traits was \"Smochy Malina\" whom Kuzco dates with. At the end she says that she loves Kuzco but he doesn't notice.\n\nLater in \"Auction Action,\" Kuzco uses Yatta to make Malina, successfully, jealous. She in turn uses Kronk. Later in the episode, during an argument between the two, she admits again that she does like Kuzco, much to her own chagrin as she then lowers her head stating \"Oh no, I can't believe I just told him that.\" In \"Kuzcokazooza\" It is stated that she does like Kuzco but is disappointed that he does not think about others. Also in this episode, she gets jealous when she thinks he has a girlfriend. In the final episode of the series, at the end she goes on a date with Kuzco straight after he is made emperor and happily becomes his girlfriend.\n\n===Minor characters===\nThe following is a list of minor characters from ''[[The Emperor's New School]]''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%;\"\n|-\n!
