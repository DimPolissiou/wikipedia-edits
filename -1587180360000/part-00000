Engraving by Pierre Landry from 1672 after a lost painting by  [[Nicolaes Maes]].<br>Under the portrait, a quatrain by [[Guy Patin]].]]\n\n*The ''heroic stanza'' or ''elegiac stanza'' ([[iambic pentameter]], rhyming ABAB or AABB; from [[Thomas Gray]]'s \"[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]\")\n<poem style=\"margin-left:3em\">\nThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\nThe lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,\nThe plowman homeward plods his weary way,\nAnd leaves the world to darkness and to me.\n</poem>\n*The [[Ruba'i]] form of rhymed quatrain was favored by [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]], among others. This work was a major inspiration for [[Edward Fitzgerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald's]] ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', written in Persian. The ''ruba'i'' was a particularly widespread verse form: the form ''rubaiyat'' reflects the plural. One of FitzGerald's verses<ref>Verse VII, see [[s:The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (tr. Fitzgerald, 5th edition)|''Rubaiyat'' version at Wikisource]]</ref> may serve to illustrate:\n<poem style=\"margin-left:3em\">\nCome, fill the Cup, and in the fire of Spring\nYour Winter garment of Repentance fling:\n   The Bird of Time has but a little way\nTo flutter\u2014and the Bird is on the Wing.\n</poem>\n*The [[Midnight Songs poetry]] form is from Fourth Century China, consisting of regular five-character lines, with each quatrain formed from a pair of rhymed couplets. The person matter involves the personal thoughts and feelings of a courtesan during the four seasons, into which the quatrains are individually assigned.\n*[[Shairi]] (also known as Rustavelian Quatrain) is an AAAA rhyming form used mainly in [[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]].\n*The [[Shichigon-zekku]] form used on [[Classical Chinese poetry]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] poetry. This type of quatrain uses a seven characters length of line. Both rhyme and rhythm are key elements, although the former is not restricted to falling at the end of the phrase.\n*[[Ballad]] meter (The examples from \"The Unquiet Grave\" and \"The Wife of Usher's Well\" are both examples of ballad meter.)\n*[[Decasyllabic quatrain]] used by [[John Dryden]] in ''[[Annus Mirabilis (poem)|Annus Mirabilis]]'', [[William Davenant]] in ''[[Gondibert]]'', and [[Thomas Gray]]\n*Various [[hymn]]s employ specific forms, such as the ''common meter'', ''long meter'', and ''short meter''.\n*In the Malay tradition, [[syair]], [[pantun]] and [[pantoum]] are arranged in quatrains.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bell number]]\n*[[Combination]]\n*[[Enclosed rhyme]]\n*[[Rhyme scheme]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* http://www.uni.edu/~gotera/CraftOfPoetry/quatrain.html\n\n{{Poetic forms}}\n\n[[Category:Stanzaic form]]\n", "name_user": "24.245.83.5", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eForms:this was all wrong so i fixed it dash-william)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatrain"}

She requested to be awoken at 6:45{{nbsp}}am, and started the day with a long prayer at her window, thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting, sometimes loudly asking the reason for her longevity and why she was the only one alive in her family. Seated on her armchair she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands (\"a distinguished woman must have beautiful hands\"), then the legs. Nurses noted that she moved faster than other residents who were 30 years younger. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk and [[rusks]].\n\nShe washed herself unassisted with a [[flannel]] cloth rather than taking a shower, applying first soap, then olive oil and powder to her face. She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed ''daube'' ([[braising|braised beef]]) but was not keen on boiled fish.

The first part records her daily routine, and the second presents her medical history. She stated that she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember which vaccine(s). Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken any medicine, not even herbal teas. She did not contract [[German measles]], [[chickenpox]], or urinary infections, and was not prone to hypertension or diabetes. In April 1986, aged 111, she was sent to hospital for [[heart failure]] and treated with [[digoxin]]. Later she suffered from [[arthropathy]] in the ankles, elbows, and wrists, which was successfully treated with [[anti-inflammatory]] medication. Her arterial blood pressure was 140mm/70mm, her pulse 84/min. Her height was {{cvt|150|cm|ftin}}, and her weight {{cvt|45|kg}}, showing little variation from previous years. She scored well on mental tests, except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events.\n\nAnalysis of her blood samples were in [[Reference ranges for blood tests|normal ranges]] between ages 111\u2013114, with no signs of dehydration, anemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the [[HLA system]] revealed the presence of the [[HLA-DR1|DR1 allele]], common among centenarians. A cardiological assessment revealed a moderate left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] hypertrophy with a mild left [[atrial]] dilatation and [[Premature heart beat|extrasystolic arrhythmia]]. Radiology revealed diffuse [[osteoporosis]], as well as incipient [[osteoarthritis]] in the right hip. An ultrasound exam showed no anomalies of internal organs.<ref name=Garoyan1990 />{{rp|22\u201342}} At this stage, Calment was still in good health, and continued to walk without a cane.<ref name=Garoyan1990 />{{rp|22\u201342}} She fell in January 1990 (aged 114) and fractured her [[femur]], which required surgery.<ref name=validation /> Subsequently, Calment used a wheelchair,<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|1\u201313}} and she abandoned her daily routine.<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|85\u201392}}\n\nAt the age of 115, Calment attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with her attending doctor, Dr. Victor L\u00e8bre, to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. According to their year-long analysis, Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to undergo a routine operation to restore her eyesight; she had a moderately weak heart, a chronic cough (\"caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco\"), and bouts of [[rheumatism]]. On the other hand, her digestion was always good, she slept well, and did not have [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. During the last years, she was {{cvt|137|cm|ftin}} tall, and weighed {{cvt|40|kg}}; she confirmed that she had always been small, and had lost weight in recent years. Her eyes were [[eye color|light gray]], and her [[Human hair color#Gray and white|white hair]] had once been chestnut brown.<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|1\u201313}}\n\nAt the age of 118, she was submitted to repeated neurophysiological tests and a [[CT scan]]. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency were comparable to those of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. [[Frontal lobe|Frontal brain lobe]] functions were relatively spared from deterioration, and there was no evidence of progressive [[neurological disease]], depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was observed to improve slightly over the six-month period.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ritchie |first1=Karen |institution=[[INSERM]] |title=Mental status examination of an exceptional case of longevity: J.

They all had exhibited strong characters, but not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical fitness declined markedly, especially after age 105.

The first part records her daily routine, and the second presents her medical history. She stated that she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember which vaccine(s). Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken any medicine, not even herbal teas. She did not contract [[German measles]], [[chickenpox]], or urinary infections, and was not prone to hypertension or diabetes. In April 1986, aged 111, she was sent to hospital for [[heart failure]] and treated with [[digoxin]]. Later she suffered from [[arthropathy]] in the ankles, elbows, and wrists, which was successfully treated with [[anti-inflammatory]] medication. Her arterial blood pressure was 140mm/70mm, her pulse 84/min. Her height was {{cvt|150|cm|ftin}}, and her weight {{cvt|45|kg}}, showing little variation from previous years. She scored well on mental tests, except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events.\n\nAnalysis of her blood samples were in [[Reference ranges for blood tests|normal ranges]] between ages 111\u2013114, with no signs of dehydration, anemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the [[HLA system]] revealed the presence of the [[HLA-DR1|DR1 allele]], common among centenarians. A cardiological assessment revealed a moderate left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] hypertrophy with a mild left [[atrial]] dilatation and [[Premature heart beat|extrasystolic arrhythmia]]. Radiology revealed diffuse [[osteoporosis]], as well as incipient [[osteoarthritis]] in the right hip. An ultrasound exam showed no anomalies of internal organs.<ref name=Garoyan1990 />{{rp|22\u201342}} At this stage, Calment was still in good health, and continued to walk without a cane.<ref name=Garoyan1990 />{{rp|22\u201342}} She fell in January 1990 (aged 114) and fractured her [[femur]], which required surgery.<ref name=validation /> Subsequently, Calment used a wheelchair,<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|1\u201313}} and she abandoned her daily routine.<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|85\u201392}}\n\nAt the age of 115, Calment attracted the attention of researchers Jean-Marie Robine and Dr. Michel Allard, who collaborated with her attending doctor, Dr. Victor L\u00e8bre, to interview her, verify her age and identify factors promoting her longevity. According to their year-long analysis, Calment's vision was severely impaired by bilateral cataracts, yet she refused to undergo a routine operation to restore her eyesight; she had a moderately weak heart, a chronic cough (\"caused no doubt by her previous use of tobacco\"), and bouts of [[rheumatism]]. On the other hand, her digestion was always good, she slept well, and did not have [[Urinary incontinence|incontinence]]. During the last years, she was {{cvt|137|cm|ftin}} tall, and weighed {{cvt|40|kg}}; she confirmed that she had always been small, and had lost weight in recent years. Her eyes were [[eye color|light gray]], and her [[Human hair color#Gray and white|white hair]] had once been chestnut brown.<ref name=Allard1998 />{{rp|1\u201313}}\n\nAt the age of 118, she was submitted to repeated neurophysiological tests and a [[CT scan]]. The tests showed that her verbal memory and language fluency were comparable to those of persons with the same level of education in their eighties and nineties. [[Frontal lobe|Frontal brain lobe]] functions were relatively spared from deterioration, and there was no evidence of progressive [[neurological disease]], depressive symptoms or other functional illness. Her cognitive functioning was observed to improve slightly over the six-month period.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ritchie |first1=Karen |institution=[[INSERM]] |title=Mental status examination of an exceptional case of longevity: J.

They concluded that the lives of these people differed widely and that they had just a few common traits: most of them were female (only two were male), most smoked little or not at all, and they had never been obese. They all had exhibited strong characters, but not all were domineering personalities. Although they aged slowly, all became very frail and their physical fitness declined markedly, especially after age 105. In their final years, they required wheelchairs and were nearly blind and deaf. \"But they did not fear death, and they appeared to be reconciled to the fact their lives would soon end.\"<ref>{{cite book | title=Jeanne Calment and her successors.

Caitlin\u2019s mother, Mary, delivers a graveside speech. Mary assures her daughter that she will be fine and Caitlin, supported by visiting best friend Hannah, returns to her third-year studies at the Glasgow School of Art.\n\nCaitlin attends a seminar given by her lecturer, Fiona. Mary phones Caitlin to say that she misses her and wants her to come back, but Caitlin explains that she has too much on. Caitlin cries after hanging up, and Hannah tries to cheer her up with an evening in, drinking and dancing. In high spirits, they spy a guy spraying graffiti on the street corner opposite and chase him down the street and into a party. He sits by Caitlin on a sofa as Hannah dances before them and then pulls Caitlin to her feet to join in.\n\nThe next day, giving a lecture on abstract expressionism, Fiona tells Caitlin, Hannah and the class that women have been overlooked and written out of history in the art books. It is up to them to change things, says Fiona. Caitlin meets with the guy from the party. He is Rory and he invites her on a date to go to a museum. She accepts, and they talk art as they view the pieces, agreeing that the time for it to be decorative is past \u2013 art should be what you see in the street each day. Caitlin, who is struggling to settle upon a format or theme for her end-of-year presentation, says that she wants to paint more, and duly begins work on a huge canvas. Frustrated, she throws paint all over her work, scarring it. Mary, meanwhile, is also revealed to be an artist. Alone in her large, sterile house, she is struggling to get back to work after Leonard\u2019s death, and likewise trashes her creation as she sculpts with clay.\n\nCaitlin receives a message on her phone and rushes home to see her mum. She finds her passed out, drunk. Awakening her, Caitlin explains that she can\u2019t be there for her right now, and that she needs to know that she\u2019s alright. Mary apologizes and assures her that it won\u2019t happen again. In another lecture, Hannah sits next to a student who introduces herself as Stacey. \n\nCaitlin is again working on her canvas and again marring it as she loses her temper. Mary achieves her own small breakthrough as she begins to sketch. Stacey calls Hannah and they agree to go out to dinner despite Hannah having loose plans with Caitlin that evening. When Caitlin later texts her, Hannah texts back that she should join her at the club she\u2019s in. Caitlin dances with Rory, while Hannah gets with Stacey. Both couples wind up back at the house, making out in Caitlin and Hannah\u2019s respective bedrooms, though Rory is too drunk for things to progress.\n\nThe next morning, in the kitchen, Caitlin and Hannah have a vicious row in front of Stacey and Rory. It begins over who drank the almond milk but rapidly progresses to more personal resentments. Caitlin storms off to go and paint her canvas. Hannah, working on her own presentation, creates a mosaic of apology notes. She also leaves a conciliatory note in Caitlin\u2019s bedroom, asking her to call her. Caitlin returns home to see her mum and pour out her heart, admitting that she feels threatened by Stacey. Mary soothes her and assures her that Hannah will be feeling every bit as bad. \n\nBack in Glasgow working on her canvas, Caitlin is interrupted by Hannah arriving to apologize. They hug and make up. Rory also turns up later but Caitlin tells him that she just want to do her own thing right now. For the class\u2019s final lecture, they are visited by Turner Prize-winning Scottish artist Catherine Hendricks, who talks of how her troubled life and celebrated art intersect. Later, Catherine accompanies Fiona to take a look at Caitlin\u2019s presentation, which mixes painted canvasses with painted fabrics. Caitlin tells Catherine of her father\u2019s passing and of how she\u2019s processed it through her work. Catherine, talking from experience, informs her that its meaning will change over the years, and then invites Caitlin to be her assistant on a project in London. Caitlin accepts but says that she does her best work in tandem with Hannah, who is also invited along. That night, Caitlin and Hannah celebrate with champagne.\n\nCaitlin visits her dad\u2019s grave. She tells him that she is leaving for London and that it feels like things are finally falling into place after being a mess for so long. She also tells him that she loves him.

Years later, Erik and Paul move houses, with their parents, from [[Houston, Texas]] to Lake Windsor Downs in [[Tangerine, Florida]]. Erik, the older son, looks forward to a [[football scholarship]] at the University of his choice. Paul, the younger son, is visually impaired and legally blind but plays soccer. His family credits his visual injury to an incident, which he does not remember, in which, at a young age, he continued to stare at a [[solar eclipse]] despite his parent's warnings not to. Soon after they unpack, Paul goes for a tour of his new school, where characters Mike Costello and his brother Joey are introduced. One day Costello is killed by lightning; whereupon Erik and his friend Arthur Bauer tell jokes after hearing the news, even though Mike was one of their teammates. On his first day of school, Paul meets Coach Walski, the coach of the soccer team, and tries out for the team, but is later told that his visual impairment prevents his eligibility, and blames this on his mother's revelation of the impairment to the school administrators\n\nWhile Paul is at school, a field of portable classrooms collapses into a [[sinkhole]]. Many people, including Paul and Joey, try to rescue those trapped, and no one is seriously injured. The emergency relocation plan gives the students the choice to stay at Lake Windsor, their present school, with a different schedule and more crowded classes, or to transfer to Tangerine Middle School, on the other, poorer side of the county; and Paul chooses Tangerine Middle, to play soccer again. When he arrives at Tangerine Middle School, he is shown around by a girl named Theresa. At lunch, Paul asks Theresa about the soccer team. Theresa tells Paul that her brother, Tino, is a member. She brings Paul to a soccer meet after school and he joins. At first, Paul's teammates Victor, the team captain, and Tino hesitate to befriend him; but a victory in the first game of the season (against the aggressive Palmetto Whippoorwills) convinces Victor to do so. Paul then persuades Joey Costello to join the school. After a quarrel with Paul, Joey returns to Lake Windsor. Throughout the story, houses in Paul's neighborhood are fumigated for termites and many of the houses are robbed by Erik and his friend Arthur. A man named Luis is introduced as the older brother of Theresa and Tino. Luis works at his parents' citrus farm and is developing a new kind of [[tangerine]] called the Golden Dawn. While at Paul's house for a school project, Tino makes fun at how Erik fell down while attempting to a kick an extra point during an earlier football game, so Erik slaps him. Luis goes to Erik's football practice to confront him with this; but Erik distracts him while signaling his friend Arthur to strike Luis from behind using a blackjack. This is witnessed by Paul, and Luis is found dead six days later from an [[aneurysm]]. Arthur had hit Luis hard enough to cause his aneurysm to weaken, and eventually burst 6 days later. Paul is told by Theresa not to go to the funeral because he is Erik's brother, and he grieves alone.\n\nOn Senior Awards Night, Tino and Victor attack Erik and Arthur as revenge for killing Luis. The football coach restrains Tino, but Paul distracts him by jumping on his back, so that Tino and Victor can escape. Paul runs back to his house, where a confrontation with a furious Arthur and Erik causes Paul to finally fully recall the memory he had been repressing\u2014after spray-painting a wall and wrongfully assuming that Paul had turned them in, Erik restrained Paul while Vincent Castor (his lackey at the time, mirroring Erik's relationship with Arthur) sprayed paint into Paul's eyes as punishment. Paul confronts his parents about their concealment of the event. His mother cries and they admit to lying about the eclipse, stating that they were only trying to ensure that Paul never hated Erik. Paul's father finally breaks down as well when Paul questions whether they thought Paul hating himself would be better instead.\n\nLater, Paul's mother discovers a gym bag in the Fishers' garage full of items that had gone missing from the tented houses in the neighborhood and holds a meeting to reveal that Erik and Arthur are the cause of the missing items. Paul's father presents restitution proposed by the sheriff, which, if signed by all the robbery victims, would result in all victims being compensated in exchange for Erik and Arthur not having charges pressed against them. Reluctantly, the victims agree. As they leave, they find the police, led to the house by Joey, waiting outside to arrest Erik and Arthur for the murder of Luis. Paul tells the police what he saw instead of covering for his brother, and Arthur is arrested while Erik is placed under House Arrest. Paul agrees to give the police a full statement to help convict them.\n\nShortly afterward, it was found that one of the star players and quarterback on the Lake Windsor team actually lived in Tangerine, causing all of the Football team's records to be nullified, and destroying Erik's football legacy.\n\nBack at the school, Paul and his mother meet with the principal, who informs him that Tino and Victor have been suspended for three weeks for attacking a student. Since Paul attacked a staff member, he was expelled from all public schools in the county. As Paul and his mother leave the school, the kids outside express approval towards him for his actions defending Tino and Victor.\n\nPaul is enrolled in private school, his only choice after his expulsion. Despite this setback, Paul resolves to continue playing for the War Eagles. The book ends with Paul being driven to his third school of the year by his father, thinking about Mike Costello and Luis and taking in the sight and smell of the orange groves. He gets emotional just thinking about what had happened to them and the effects it had on their families.\n\n==Awards==\n*[[Rebecca Caudill]] Young Reader's Book Award Nominee (2001) \n*[[South Carolina Book Award]] for Junior Book Award (2000)\n*[[Michigan Library]] Association Thumbs Up!
