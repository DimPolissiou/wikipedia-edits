[[James Dean]] remains the only actor to have been posthumously nominated in this category on more than one occasion. At age 29, [[Adrien Brody]] became the youngest actor to win this award for ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' (2002), while [[Henry Fonda]], at age 76, became the oldest winner for ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]''.

He was a longtime director of the [[Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology]] at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\n==Education and early life==\nLack was born in London, the oldest of four children of Harry Lambert Lack [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|FRCS]], who later became President of the [[British Medical Association]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=n.p.|year=2007|title=Harry Lambert Lack, M.D., F.R.C.S|journal=The Journal of Laryngology & Otology|volume=58|issue=3|pages=135\u2013136|doi=10.1017/S0022215100011038|pmc=|pmid=|doi-access=free}}</ref> The name 'Lack' is derived from 'Lock'. His father grew up in a farming family from Norfolk and became a leading ear, nose and throat surgeon at the [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]]. Although his father had some interest in birds as a boy it does not appear that he influenced David's interest. His mother Kathleen was the daughter of Lt. Col. McNeil Rind of the [[British Indian Army|Indian army]]. Kathleen's father was Scottish and on her mother's side was part Irish, Greek and Georgian.<ref name=\"thorpe\" /> Kathleen had been an actor and was a supporter of women's suffrage. At home they organized meetings of the poetry society. David was schooled at home until seven and then went to the Open Air School in Regent's Park before going to The Hall, Hampstead followed by Foster's School, Stubbington and [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk]]. Lack was taught biology at Gresham's by W.H. Foy and G.H.

In 1935 he made his first trip to the United States as a chaperone for a Dartington Hall student returning to California. Here he met [[Joseph Grinnell]] and [[Robert McCabe]] and gave a talk at the [[Cooper Ornithological Society|Cooper Ornithological Club]]. In New York, he met [[Ernst Mayr]] at the American Museum of Natural History. He returned via the ''[[SS Bremen (1928)|SS Bremen]]'', only one of about four English speakers on the German ship.<ref>Anderson (2013):43-45.</ref> He was only in the Galapagos for part of that year, starting August 1938. With the data that he collected in the Galapagos, especially on the finches he went to the United States. April to August 1939 was spent at the [[California Academy of Sciences]] which held a large collection of the finches of Galapagos that had been studied earlier by [[Harry Swarth]] and at [[Ernst Mayr]]'s home in [[New Jersey]]. While in the US he made a study of the tricoloured blackbird with John T. Emlen.<ref>Anderson (2013):58-59.</ref>  He returned home in September 1939, after the outbreak of war.<ref>Provine, William B (1986) ''Sewall Wright and evolutionary biology''. Chicago. {{ISBN|0226684733}} p. 406</ref> Lack published ''The Galapagos Finches (Geospizinae), A Study in Variation'' in which he examined variations within species across islands and considered that many of them were non-adaptive and due to founder effect and genetic drift.<ref>Anderson (2013):59-60.</ref> Lack's first major work was ''The Life of the Robin'', which was based on four years of field work that he conducted while teaching at [[Dartington Hall|Dartington Hall School]]. He examined robin behaviour, song, territory, pairing and breeding using ringing to mark and track individual birds.<ref>Anderson (2013):25-27.</ref> The manuscript was completed in 1942 and it went through five editions from 1943 to 1970. One of Lack's students at Dartington Hall was [[Eva Ibbotson]]. A colleague who helped in filming some of the robins for Lack was the geography teacher Bill Hunter. In 1934 Lack went to Tanganyika on an invitation from [[Reginald Ernest Moreau|R.E. Moreau]].<ref>Anderson (2013):34-35.</ref>\n[[File:Apus apus 01.jpg|thumb|upright|The Common Swift, one of many subjects studied by Lack.]]\n\nLack was committed to pacificism and debated the philosophy even during his Dartington days with the founder of the college, [[Leonard Knight Elmhirst]]. During [[World War II]] Lack however served with a [[British Army]] unit called the Army Operational Research Group on the Orkney Islands working on [[radar]] use. During this work he met other biologists who had been inducted into the war including [[George C. Varley|George Varley]], an entomologist who introduced him to the idea of density-dependent regulation of animal populations.<ref>Anderson (2013):47.</ref> Lack's observations on spurious echoes produced by birds would later allow him to establish the field of [[radar ornithology]] to study [[bird migration]].<ref>Anderson (2013):48-49.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Fox, A.D.|author2=Beasley, Patrick D.L.|year=2010|title=David Lack and the birth of radar ornithology|journal=Archives of Natural History|volume=37|issue=2|pages=325\u2013332|doi=10.3366/anh.2010.0013}}</ref> Lack was released from wartime duty in August 1945 so as to take a position to as Director (succeeding [[Wilfred Backhouse Alexander|W.B. Alexander]]) of the [[Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology]] at [[Oxford University]], a position that he held until his death in 1973.\n\nLack's work in ornithology was almost entirely based on studies of the ''living bird''. He was one of the pioneers of life-history studies in Britain, especially those based on quantitative approaches, when some traditional ornithologists of the time were focussing their studies on morphology and geographic distribution.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = K. | title = The Ibis: Transformations in a Twentieth Century British Natural History Journal | doi = 10.1007/s10739-004-1499-3 | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 515\u2013555 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> Lack's major scientific research included work on [[population biology]] and density dependent regulation. His work suggested that natural selection favoured [[avian clutch size|clutch size]]s that ensured the greatest number of surviving young. This interpretation was however debated by [[V.C. Wynne-Edwards]] who suggested that clutch size was density-independent. This was one of the earliest debates on [[group selection]]. Lack's studies were based on [[nidicolous]] birds and some recent studies have suggested that his findings may not hold for other groups such as seabirds.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Ydenberg, R.C.  |author2=Bertram, D.F. |year=1989|title= Lack's clutch size hypothesis and brood enlargement studies on colonial seabirds|journal=Colonial Waterbirds|volume=12|issue=1|pages= 134\u2013137|doi=10.2307/1521328|jstor=1521328 }}</ref>\n\nAs a mentor for numerous doctoral students, Lack followed a hands-off method, letting students decide their own research topics. He encouraged students to sort out their ideas and find the \"simplest explanation, which was probably best.\" He would make students work on their papers and give only one reading to their thesis asking them to choose either a draft or a final version to submit.<ref>Anderson (2013):159-160.</ref>\n\nHe wrote numerous papers in ornithological journals, and had a knack of choosing memorable titles: he once claimed to have single-handedly caused the renaming of a group of birds through the submission of a scientific paper with the title \"Territory and Polygamy in a Bishop\". This 1935 publication was subsequently titled \"Territory and polygamy in a bishop bird, ''[[Euplectes hordeaceus|Euplectes hordeacea]] hordeacea'' (Linn.)\" in the journal ''Ibis'' as the journal editor felt that the title might cause misunderstanding.<ref>Anderson (2013):39.</ref>\n\n=== Darwin's finches ===\nLack's most famous work is ''Darwin's Finches,'' a landmark study whose title linked [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s name with the [[Galapagos]] group of species and popularised the term \"[[Darwin's finches]]\" in 1947, though the term had been introduced by [[Percy Lowe]] in 1936.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Steinheimer | first1 = F.

Ratcliffe and Peter T. Boag). {{ISBN|0-521-25243-1}}</ref> This change of mind, according to Lack's Preface, came about as a result of his reflections on his own data whilst he was doing war work. The effect of this change in interpretation is to put the emphasis for speciation onto natural selection for appropriate food handling instead of seeing it primarily as a by-product of an isolating mechanism. In this way his work contributed to the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]], in which [[natural selection]] came to be seen as the prime mover in evolution, and not random or mutational events. Lack's work laid the foundations for the much more extensive work of [[Peter and Rosemary Grant]] and their colleagues.<ref>Grant, Peter R. 1999. ''Ecology and evolution of Darwin's finches''. Princeton NJ.</ref> Lack's work feeds into studies of island biogeography which continue the same range of issues presented by the Galapagos fauna on a more varied canvas.<ref>MacArthur R. and Wilson E.O. 1967. ''The theory of island biogeography''. Princeton 1967.</ref> According to [[Ernst Mayr]],\n\n:\"The person who more than anyone else deserves credit for reviving an interest in the ecological significance of species was David Lack... It is now quite clear that the process of speciation is not completed by the acquisition of isolating mechanisms but requires also the acquisition of adaptations that permit co-existence with potential competitors.\"<ref name=Mayr274>Mayr, Ernst (1985).

Lack was then an assistant to the editor of the ''Ibis''.<ref>Anderson (2013):62.</ref> Lack postulated what is now known as Lack's Principle, which states that \"the clutch size of each species of bird has been adapted by natural selection to correspond with the largest number of young for which the parents can, on average, provide enough food\".<ref>Lack D (1954) The regulation of animal numbers.

''The Natural Regulation of Animal Numbers'' is one of Lack's most frequently cited works. Here he gave primacy to natural selection in determining the rate of reproduction and he especially countered the idea that it was adjusted with mortality rates so that constant populations are maintained. It was critiqued by [[J. B. S. Haldane|J.B.S. Haldane]] who found it lacking mathematical precision and biased to bird studies. The other major critic was [[V. C. Wynne-Edwards|V.C. Wynne-Edwards]] with whom he clashed for nearly a decade.<ref>Anderson (2013):78-81.</ref> Lack followed up on the criticisms in his later books including Population Studies of Birds (1966).\n\n===Published books===\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n*Lack, David. 1943.

Elizabeth Silva was born in Hertfordshire in 1916 and took an early interest in music. She wished to joined the Royal Academy of Music in London but the war led to her serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service as an ambulance driver in Europe. After the war she applied for work and due to her interest in birds she sent her resume to [[R. S. R. Fitter|Richard Fitter]] who passed it on to David Lack with a note \"Here's another for your reject file.\" Lack however interviewed her and appointed her as a secretary. Noting her interest in birds, he also invited her to serve as a field assistant for studies in the Wytham Woods. She also helped in the study of swifts. One day Elizabeth did not return to her office after her observations of the swifts and David, worried that she might have fallen off a ladder, found her engrossed in observation. They became engaged in 1948 and were married on July 9, 1949. The best man was George Varley.<ref>Anderson (2013):105-107.</ref> They had four children: Peter Lack (born 1952, a biologist), [[Andrew Lack]] (born 1953, also a biologist and academic), Paul Lack (born 1957, a freelance teacher), and Catherine Lack (born 1959, a university chaplain).<ref name=\"anderson\" /> In Oxford, the Lacks initially lived in a flat in [[Park Town, Oxford]], and later on [[Boars Hill]], just south of Oxford. Lack enjoyed music and was also a fan of field hockey and tennis in which he also participated.<ref>Anderson (2013):119-107.</ref> Lack died from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma despite radiation treatments.<ref>Anderson (2013):214-215.</ref>\n\n===Religious beliefs===\nLack's parents belonged to the Church of England and he was an agnostic as an early adult but became a convert to [[Anglicanism]] in 1948, possibly influenced by Dan and Mary Neylan, friends at Dartington Hall.<ref>Anderson (2013):127.</ref> He sought to find a compromise between science and religion and wrote, in 1957, ''Evolutionary theory and Christian belief,'' on the relationship between Christian faith and evolutionary theory. Lack believed that evolution could not account for morality, truth, beauty, free will, self-awareness and individual responsibility.<ref>Anderson (2013):123-124.</ref> This book foreshadows, in some ways, the non-overlapping magisteria conception of the relationship between [[religion and science]] later popularised by [[Stephen Jay Gould]].\n\n[[Arthur Cain]] remarked of him \"David Lack was the only religious man I knew at that period who did not allow his religion to dictate his view of natural selection.\"<ref>Cain, A.

He was a longtime director of the [[Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology]] at the [[University of Oxford]].\n\n==Education and early life==\nLack was born in London, the oldest of four children of Harry Lambert Lack [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|FRCS]], who later became President of the [[British Medical Association]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=n.p.|year=2007|title=Harry Lambert Lack, M.D., F.R.C.S|journal=The Journal of Laryngology & Otology|volume=58|issue=3|pages=135\u2013136|doi=10.1017/S0022215100011038|pmc=|pmid=|doi-access=free}}</ref> The name 'Lack' is derived from 'Lock'. His father grew up in a farming family from Norfolk and became a leading ear, nose and throat surgeon at the [[Royal London Hospital|London Hospital]]. Although his father had some interest in birds as a boy it does not appear that he influenced David's interest. His mother Kathleen was the daughter of Lt. Col. McNeil Rind of the [[British Indian Army|Indian army]]. Kathleen's father was Scottish and on her mother's side was part Irish, Greek and Georgian.<ref name=\"thorpe\" /> Kathleen had been an actor and was a supporter of women's suffrage. At home they organized meetings of the poetry society. David was schooled at home until seven and then went to the Open Air School in Regent's Park before going to The Hall, Hampstead followed by Foster's School, Stubbington and [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk]]. Lack was taught biology at Gresham's by W.H. Foy and G.H. Lockett.<ref>Anderson (2013):6-9.</ref> He went to [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]] and received a BA second class in 1933 after studying botany, zoology and geology for part I of the Tripos and zoology for part II.<ref>Anderson (2013):15.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Lack, David|year=1973|title=My life as an amateur ornithologist|journal=Ibis|volume=115|pages=421\u2013431|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1973.tb01982.x}}</ref>\n\nUntil the age of fifteen, Lack lived in a large house in Devonshire Place, London. The family spent their summers in New Romney Kent where Lack became familiar with the local birds especially on Romney Marsh.<ref>Anderson (2013):6-7.</ref> By the age of nine, he had learnt the names of most birds and had written out an alphabetically arranged life-list.<ref name=thorpe/> In 1926, Lack won the Holland-Martin Natural History Prize for an essay on \"Three Birds of Kelling Heath\".<ref>Anderson (2013):12.</ref> In 1928, with an essay on 'My favourite birds' he was the national winner of the senior prize (a silver medal) in the Public School Essay Competition, organised by the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]].<ref>\"Public School Essay Competition\", ''The Times'', 17 December 1928; p. 12; Issue 45078; col C</ref> David did not wish to follow his father's profession in medicine and took an interest in zoology. His father then considered entomology which was then the only professional field in zoology and found work for David at the Frankfurt museum in the summer of 1929. He spent four months pinning insects in the [[Naturmuseum Senckenberg|Senckenberg Museum]] and fount it \u201cextremely\u201d boring.<ref>Anderson (2013):14.</ref> He joined the Cambridge Ornithological Club whose members included [[Peter Scott]], [[Arthur Duncan]], [[Dominic Serventy]], and [[Tom Harrisson]].

In 1935 he made his first trip to the United States as a chaperone for a Dartington Hall student returning to California. Here he met [[Joseph Grinnell]] and [[Robert McCabe]] and gave a talk at the [[Cooper Ornithological Society|Cooper Ornithological Club]]. In New York, he met [[Ernst Mayr]] at the American Museum of Natural History. He returned via the ''[[SS Bremen (1928)|SS Bremen]]'', only one of about four English speakers on the German ship.<ref>Anderson (2013):43-45.</ref> He was only in the Galapagos for part of that year, starting August 1938. With the data that he collected in the Galapagos, especially on the finches he went to the United States. April to August 1939 was spent at the [[California Academy of Sciences]] which held a large collection of the finches of Galapagos that had been studied earlier by [[Harry Swarth]] and at [[Ernst Mayr]]'s home in [[New Jersey]]. While in the US he made a study of the tricoloured blackbird with John T. Emlen.<ref>Anderson (2013):58-59.</ref>  He returned home in September 1939, after the outbreak of war.<ref>Provine, William B (1986) ''Sewall Wright and evolutionary biology''. Chicago. {{ISBN|0226684733}} p. 406</ref> Lack published ''The Galapagos Finches (Geospizinae), A Study in Variation'' in which he examined variations within species across islands and considered that many of them were non-adaptive and due to founder effect and genetic drift.<ref>Anderson (2013):59-60.</ref> Lack's first major work was ''The Life of the Robin'', which was based on four years of field work that he conducted while teaching at [[Dartington Hall|Dartington Hall School]]. He examined robin behaviour, song, territory, pairing and breeding using ringing to mark and track individual birds.<ref>Anderson (2013):25-27.</ref> The manuscript was completed in 1942 and it went through five editions from 1943 to 1970. One of Lack's students at Dartington Hall was [[Eva Ibbotson]]. A colleague who helped in filming some of the robins for Lack was the geography teacher Bill Hunter. In 1934 Lack went to Tanganyika on an invitation from [[Reginald Ernest Moreau|R.E. Moreau]].<ref>Anderson (2013):34-35.</ref>\n[[File:Apus apus 01.jpg|thumb|upright|The Common Swift, one of many subjects studied by Lack.]]\n\nLack was committed to pacificism and debated the philosophy even during his Dartington days with the founder of the college, [[Leonard Knight Elmhirst]]. During [[World War II]] Lack however served with a [[British Army]] unit called the Army Operational Research Group on the Orkney Islands working on [[radar]] use. During this work he met other biologists who had been inducted into the war including [[George C. Varley|George Varley]], an entomologist who introduced him to the idea of density-dependent regulation of animal populations.<ref>Anderson (2013):47.</ref> Lack's observations on spurious echoes produced by birds would later allow him to establish the field of [[radar ornithology]] to study [[bird migration]].<ref>Anderson (2013):48-49.</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Fox, A.D.|author2=Beasley, Patrick D.L.|year=2010|title=David Lack and the birth of radar ornithology|journal=Archives of Natural History|volume=37|issue=2|pages=325\u2013332|doi=10.3366/anh.2010.0013}}</ref> Lack was released from wartime duty in August 1945 so as to take a position to as Director (succeeding [[Wilfred Backhouse Alexander|W.B. Alexander]]) of the [[Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology]] at [[Oxford University]], a position that he held until his death in 1973.\n\nLack's work in ornithology was almost entirely based on studies of the ''living bird''. He was one of the pioneers of life-history studies in Britain, especially those based on quantitative approaches, when some traditional ornithologists of the time were focussing their studies on morphology and geographic distribution.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = K. | title = The Ibis: Transformations in a Twentieth Century British Natural History Journal | doi = 10.1007/s10739-004-1499-3 | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 515\u2013555 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> Lack's major scientific research included work on [[population biology]] and density dependent regulation. His work suggested that natural selection favoured [[avian clutch size|clutch size]]s that ensured the greatest number of surviving young. This interpretation was however debated by [[V.C. Wynne-Edwards]] who suggested that clutch size was density-independent. This was one of the earliest debates on [[group selection]]. Lack's studies were based on [[nidicolous]] birds and some recent studies have suggested that his findings may not hold for other groups such as seabirds.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Ydenberg, R.C.  |author2=Bertram, D.F. |year=1989|title= Lack's clutch size hypothesis and brood enlargement studies on colonial seabirds|journal=Colonial Waterbirds|volume=12|issue=1|pages= 134\u2013137|doi=10.2307/1521328|jstor=1521328 }}</ref>\n\nAs a mentor for numerous doctoral students, Lack followed a hands-off method, letting students decide their own research topics. He encouraged students to sort out their ideas and find the \"simplest explanation, which was probably best.\" He would make students work on their papers and give only one reading to their thesis asking them to choose either a draft or a final version to submit.<ref>Anderson (2013):159-160.</ref>\n\nHe wrote numerous papers in ornithological journals, and had a knack of choosing memorable titles: he once claimed to have single-handedly caused the renaming of a group of birds through the submission of a scientific paper with the title \"Territory and Polygamy in a Bishop\". This 1935 publication was subsequently titled \"Territory and polygamy in a bishop bird, ''[[Euplectes hordeaceus|Euplectes hordeacea]] hordeacea'' (Linn.)\" in the journal ''Ibis'' as the journal editor felt that the title might cause misunderstanding.<ref>Anderson (2013):39.</ref>\n\n=== Darwin's finches ===\nLack's most famous work is ''Darwin's Finches,'' a landmark study whose title linked [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s name with the [[Galapagos]] group of species and popularised the term \"[[Darwin's finches]]\" in 1947, though the term had been introduced by [[Percy Lowe]] in 1936.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Steinheimer | first1 = F.

Ratcliffe and Peter T. Boag). {{ISBN|0-521-25243-1}}</ref> This change of mind, according to Lack's Preface, came about as a result of his reflections on his own data whilst he was doing war work. The effect of this change in interpretation is to put the emphasis for speciation onto natural selection for appropriate food handling instead of seeing it primarily as a by-product of an isolating mechanism. In this way his work contributed to the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]], in which [[natural selection]] came to be seen as the prime mover in evolution, and not random or mutational events. Lack's work laid the foundations for the much more extensive work of [[Peter and Rosemary Grant|Peter and Rosemary Grant]] and their colleagues.<ref>Grant, Peter R. 1999. ''Ecology and evolution of Darwin's finches''.

''The theory of island biogeography''. Princeton 1967.</ref> According to [[Ernst Mayr]],\n\n:\"The person who more than anyone else deserves credit for reviving an interest in the ecological significance of species was David Lack... It is now quite clear that the process of speciation is not completed by the acquisition of isolating mechanisms but requires also the acquisition of adaptations that permit co-existence with potential competitors.\"<ref name=Mayr274>Mayr, Ernst (1985).

''The Natural Regulation of Animal Numbers'' is one of Lack's most frequently cited works. Here he gave primacy to natural selection in determining the rate of reproduction and he especially countered the idea that it was adjusted with mortality rates so that constant populations are maintained. It was critiqued by [[J. B. S. Haldane|J.B.S. Haldane]] who found it lacking mathematical precision and biased to bird studies. The other major critic was [[V. C. Wynne-Edwards|V.C. Wynne-Edwards]] with whom he clashed for nearly a decade.<ref>Anderson (2013):78-81.</ref> Lack followed up on the criticisms in his later books including Population Studies of Birds (1966).\n\n===Published books===\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n*Lack, David. 1943.

Elizabeth Silva was born in Hertfordshire in 1916 and took an early interest in music. She wished to joined the Royal Academy of Music in London but the war led to her serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service as an ambulance driver in Europe. After the war she applied for work and due to her interest in birds she sent her resume to [[R. S. R. Fitter|Richard Fitter]] who passed it on to David Lack with a note \"Here's another for your reject file.\" Lack however interviewed her and appointed her as a secretary. Noting her interest in birds, he also invited her to serve as a field assistant for studies in the Wytham Woods. She also helped in the study of swifts. One day Elizabeth did not return to her office after her observations of the swifts and David, worried that she might have fallen off a ladder, found her engrossed in observation. They became engaged in 1948 and were married on July 9, 1949. The best man was George Varley.<ref>Anderson (2013):105-107.</ref> They had four children: Peter Lack (born 1952, a biologist), [[Andrew Lack]] (born 1953, also a biologist and academic), Paul Lack (born 1957, a freelance teacher), and Catherine Lack (born 1959, a university chaplain).<ref name=\"anderson\" /> In Oxford, the Lacks initially lived in a flat in [[Park Town, Oxford]], and later on [[Boars Hill]], just south of Oxford. Lack enjoyed music and was also a fan of field hockey and tennis in which he also participated.<ref>Anderson (2013):119-107.</ref> Lack died from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma despite radiation treatments.<ref>Anderson (2013):214-215.</ref>\n\n===Religious beliefs===\nLack's parents belonged to the Church of England and he was an agnostic as an early adult but became a convert to [[Anglicanism]] in 1948, possibly influenced by Dan and Mary Neylan, friends at Dartington Hall.<ref>Anderson (2013):127.</ref> He sought to find a compromise between science and religion and wrote, in 1957, ''Evolutionary theory and Christian belief,'' on the relationship between Christian faith and evolutionary theory. Lack believed that evolution could not account for morality, truth, beauty, free will, self-awareness and individual responsibility.<ref>Anderson (2013):123-124.</ref> This book foreshadows, in some ways, the non-overlapping magisteria conception of the relationship between [[religion and science]] later popularised by [[Stephen Jay Gould]].\n\n[[Arthur Cain]] remarked of him \"David Lack was the only religious man I knew at that period who did not allow his religion to dictate his view of natural selection.\"<ref>Cain, A.

{"title_page": "1913 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Cleanup|reason=drop caps as per [[MOS:HEADINGS]]|date=April 2020}}\nThe 1913 [[Auckland Rugby League]] season was the 5th season of the Auckland Rugby league. It followed the [[1912 Auckland Rugby League season]].\n\nThe first grade competition began on 3 May with the same 6 teams that had competed in the 1912 season, however [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] pulled out of the competition midway through the season as they struggled to put a full team on the field. The Eden Ramblers also pulled out at the same time. [[North Shore Albions]] were crowned champions for the first time.\n\nOther clubs competing in lower grades were [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote Ramblers]] now known as the Northcote Tigers, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie Wanderers]], who later became known as the Ellerslie Eagles. A match was also played between Avondale and New Lynn in [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]] on 13 September. The match was won by New Lynn by 23 points to 8.\n\n===Charles Savory Controversy===\nIn a match involving Ponsonby and Manukau in Onehunga, [[Charles Savory]] was accused of kicking an opponent. The incident was not seen by the referee but an [[Auckland Rugby League]] official claimed to have seen it and as a result Savory was banned for life by Auckland Rugby League. Savory had been selected to play for New Zealand on their tour of Australia and as a result of the ban was unable to make the trip. When the evidence was presented to New Zealand League they said that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the penalty and refused to confirm it. Auckland Rugby League then decided to strike Savory off the list of registered players thus making him ineligible to play in Auckland. Auckland selector [[Ronald MacDonald (rugby league)|Ronald MacDonald]] chose Savory to play against Wellington in their match on 23 August but was told at an Auckland Rugby League meeting that he was ineligible and they questioned why he had chosen him to play. MacDonald replied \"one reason is because he is one of the best forwards in the Dominion. What was he suspended for?\". A lengthy discussion followed and MacDonald refused to withdraw Savory's name from selection and a motion was then passed that MacDonald be removed from his position as Auckland selector. This was carried unanimously with Mr Angus Campbell appointed selector, and [[Morgan Hayward]] chosen to replace Savory in the side for the match with Wellington.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Football Resentment/League Selector Replaced/\"Savory Shall Not Play\"\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=199\n| date = 1913-08-21\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130821.2.87\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===Death of a Player===\nTragedy struck in May in a 3rd grade match between [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] when 26 year old Adolphus Theodore Bust was killed. The death occurred at Ellerslie. He was said to have collided with an opposing player and the two of them fell to the ground with a third player falling on top of them. The other two men rose to their feet to carry on playing but Bust remained stationary on the ground. Dr. Baber was called to attend from his residence in Remuera but he found that Bust's spinal cord was fractured near the base of the skull and he recommended he be taken to hospital however Bust's father decided to have him taken to his home in Ellerslie. He was unable to be revived and died at 8.30am the following morning.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Footballers Death/Spinal Cord Fractured/Accident at Ellerslie\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=124\n| date = 1913-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130526.2.59\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref> After the incident the deceased father said he witnessed the incident and was satisfied that it was an accident. Martin Ellis, the player involved in the tackle said that he was running down the field and Bust was waiting to tackle him and had dived and caught Ellis by the legs but his neck struck him on the hip and they both fell to the ground. The coroner returned the verdict that nobody was to blame for the death.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Killed at Football\n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=125\n| date = 1913-05-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130527.2.86\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1912 Auckland Rugby League season|1912]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=5th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=\t1913}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1914 Auckland Rugby League season|1914]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Myers Cup (First Grade Competition)==\nEighteen regular season matches were played before [[North Shore Albions]] were awarded the title.\n\n===Final Standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Albions]]\n|7||5||1||1||80||55||'''11'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|7||4||0||3||117||53||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|7||3||2||2||60||46||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby RFC|Ponsonby United]]\n|7||4||0||3||103||65||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Eden Ramblers]]\n|5||1||0||4||18||124||'''2'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]]\n|5||0||1||4||21||56||'''1'''\n|-\n|}\n\n===Myers Cup Fixtures===\n======Round 1======\n[[Karl Ifwersen]] had switched codes and made his debut appearance for North Shore.

[[North Shore Albions]] were crowned champions for the first time.\n\nOther clubs competing in lower grades were [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote Ramblers]] now known as the Northcote Tigers, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie Wanderers]], who later became known as the Ellerslie Eagles. A match was also played between Avondale and New Lynn in [[Avondale, Auckland|Avondale]] on 13 September. The match was won by New Lynn by 23 points to 8.\n\n===Charles Savory Controversy===\nIn a match involving Ponsonby and Manukau in Onehunga, [[Charles Savory]] was accused of kicking an opponent. The incident was not seen by the referee but an [[Auckland Rugby League]] official claimed to have seen it and as a result Savory was banned for life by Auckland Rugby League. Savory had been selected to play for New Zealand on their tour of Australia and as a result of the ban was unable to make the trip. When the evidence was presented to New Zealand League they said that the evidence was not sufficient to justify the penalty and refused to confirm it. Auckland Rugby League then decided to strike Savory off the list of registered players thus making him ineligible to play in Auckland. Auckland selector [[Ronald MacDonald (rugby league)|Ronald MacDonald]] chose Savory to play against Wellington in their match on 23 August but was told at an Auckland Rugby League meeting that he was ineligible and they questioned why he had chosen him to play. MacDonald replied \"one reason is because he is one of the best forwards in the Dominion. What was he suspended for?\". A lengthy discussion followed and MacDonald refused to withdraw Savory's name from selection and a motion was then passed that MacDonald be removed from his position as Auckland selector. This was carried unanimously with Mr Angus Campbell appointed selector, and [[Morgan Hayward]] chosen to replace Savory in the side for the match with Wellington.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Football Resentment/League Selector Replaced/\"Savory Shall Not Play\"\n| page =7\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=199\n| date = 1913-08-21\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130821.2.87\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n===Death of a Player===\nTragedy struck in May in a 3rd grade match between [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] when 26 year old Adolphus Theodore Bust was killed. The death occurred at Ellerslie. He was said to have collided with an opposing player and the two of them fell to the ground with a third player falling on top of them. The other two men rose to their feet to carry on playing but Bust remained stationary on the ground. Dr. Baber was called to attend from his residence in Remuera but he found that Bust's spinal cord was fractured near the base of the skull and he recommended he be taken to hospital however Bust's father decided to have him taken to his home in Ellerslie. He was unable to be revived and died at 8.30am the following morning.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Footballers Death/Spinal Cord Fractured/Accident at Ellerslie\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=124\n| date = 1913-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130526.2.59\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref> After the incident the deceased father said he witnessed the incident and was satisfied that it was an accident. Martin Ellis, the player involved in the tackle said that he was running down the field and Bust was waiting to tackle him and had dived and caught Ellis by the legs but his neck struck him on the hip and they both fell to the ground. The coroner returned the verdict that nobody was to blame for the death.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Killed at Football\n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=XLIV| issue=125\n| date = 1913-05-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19130527.2.86\n| accessdate = 2019-12-27}}</ref>\n\n{{s-start}}\n        {{s-bef|before=[[1912 Auckland Rugby League season|1912]]}}\n        {{s-ttl|title=5th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n        |years=\t1913}}\n        {{s-aft|after=[[1914 Auckland Rugby League season|1914]]}}\n        {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Myers Cup (First Grade Competition)==\nEighteen regular season matches were played before [[North Shore Albions]] were awarded the title.\n\n===Final Standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175 |Team\n!width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld\n!width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W\n!width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D\n!width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L\n!width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F\n!width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A\n!width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[North Shore Albions]]\n|7||5||1||1||80||55||'''11'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Newton Rangers]]\n|7||4||0||3||117||53||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[City Rovers]]\n|7||3||2||2||60||46||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Ponsonby RFC|Ponsonby United]]\n|7||4||0||3||103||65||'''8'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Eden Ramblers]]\n|5||1||0||4||18||124||'''2'''\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]]\n|5||0||1||4||21||56||'''1'''\n|-\n|}\n\n===Myers Cup Fixtures===\n======Round 1======\n[[Karl Ifwersen]] had switched codes and made his debut appearance for North Shore.

He made one [[Super Bowl]] appearance in [[Super Bowl XLVI|XLVI]].\n\nDuring the 2013 off-season, Hernandez was arrested and charged for the murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianc\u00e9e. Following his arrest, Hernandez was immediately [[Dismissal (employment)#High-profile firings|released]] by the Patriots. He was found guilty of [[first-degree murder]] in 2015 and sentenced to serve [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life in prison]] without the possibility of [[Parole in the United States|parole]] at the [[Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center]].<ref name=\"guilty\" /> While on trial for Lloyd's murder, he was also [[Indictment#United States|indicted]] for the 2012 double [[homicide]] of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, but he was [[acquitted]] after a 2017 trial.\n\nDays after being acquitted of the double homicide, Hernandez was found dead in his cell. His death was ruled a [[suicide]] by hanging. His conviction for Lloyd's murder was initially [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] under the doctrine of [[abatement ab initio|abatement ''ab initio'']] because Hernandez died during its [[appeal]],<ref name=\"Yan\" /> but it was reinstated in 2019 following an appeal from [[prosecutor]]s and Odin Lloyd's family.<ref name=\"gaffin\" /> After his death, Hernandez was diagnosed with severe [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), which may have affected his actions and emotional stability and may have been a contributing factor in some of his criminal behavior.<ref name=\"waste\" />\n\n== Early life ==\n===Family===\nAaron Josef Hernandez was born in [[Bristol, Connecticut]], and raised on Greystone Avenue.<ref name=\"smile\" /> He was the son of Dennis Hernandez, of Puerto Rican descent, and Terri Valentine-Hernandez, of Italian descent.<ref name=\"smile\" /> As an adult, Hernandez remembered his mother throwing his father out of the house on multiple occasions, but always letting him back in.<ref name=\"smile\" /> The couple married in 1986, divorced in 1991, and remarried in 1996.<ref name=\"smile\" /> In 1991, they filed for [[bankruptcy]].<ref name=\"smile\" /> Hernandez would later state there was constant fighting going on in the home.<ref name=\"smile\" /> Both parents would be arrested and involved in crime during their lives.<ref name=\"smile\" />\n\nHernandez had an older brother, Dennis Jonathan Jr., known as D.J.<ref name=\"smile\" /> Their father pushed them to excel, including through sports, but was often [[domestic abuse|abusive]] towards both the boys and their mother.<ref name=\"smile\" /><ref name=\"levenson\" /> Publicly, their father projected an image of someone who had some run-ins with the police but turned his life around to become a good father and citizen.<ref name=\"smile\" />\n\nHernandez's father died in January 2006, from complications from [[hernia]] surgery, when Hernandez was 16.<ref name=\"Varela\" /> According to his mother, Hernandez was greatly affected by his father's death, and he acted out his grief by rebelling against authority figures.<ref name=\"kelly\" /><ref name=\"Reynolds\" /> Those who knew him said he never got over his father's death.<ref name=\"smile\" />\n\nHernandez became [[family estrangement|estranged]] from his mother, and largely moved in with Tanya Singleton, his older cousin.<ref name=\"smile\" /> Following Dennis' death, the family learned that Terri Hernandez and Singleton's husband, Jeff Cummings, had been having an [[extramarital affair]].<ref name=\"smile\" /><ref name=\"swamp\" /> After the affair became public, Singleton and Cummings divorced, and Cummings moved in with Terri.<ref name=\"smile\" /> This \"enraged\" Hernandez.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> It was while he was living with Singleton that Hernandez became more involved in criminal activity.<ref name=\"smile\" />\n\nIn a jailhouse conversation, Hernandez accused his mother, Terri, of failing to obtain medication for his [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], which he said caused him to struggle in school.<ref name=\"smile\" /> In another call, he told her, \"There's so many things I would love to talk to you [about], so you can know me as a person.

He finished the season with nine receptions for 151 yards and two touchdowns. Though he excelled his freshman year, he was benched in the season opener of his sophomore year due to a failed drug test.<ref name=\"swamp\" />  Following that, he started eleven of thirteen games during the [[2008 Florida Gators football team|2008 season]] in place of the injured [[Cornelius Ingram]], and finished the season with 34 receptions for 381 yards and five touchdowns. In the [[2009 BCS National Championship Game]] against the [[2008 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma Sooners]], Hernandez led the Gators in receiving yards with 57 on five receptions, as the Gators defeated the Sooners 24\u201314 to win their second BCS championship in three seasons.<ref name=\"Tebow\" />\n\nAs a junior in [[2009 Florida Gators football team|2009]], and after leading the team in receptions with 68 for 850 yards and five touchdowns, Hernandez won the [[John Mackey Award]] given annually to the nation's best tight end.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> He was also a first-team All-[[Southeastern Conference]] selection and was recognized as a first-team [[2009 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] by the [[Associated Press]], ''[[College Football News]]'' and ''[[The Sporting News]].''<ref name=\"ufmediaguide\" /> During his final game, he threw the ball into the stands to celebrate a touchdown.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> The [[Touchdown celebration#NCAA football|excessive display risked a personal foul penalty]], but sportswriters saw an athlete with little to lose personally if he chose to go into the NFL instead of returning for another year of collegiate football.\n\nMeyer had wanted to throw Hernandez off the team for his chronic marijuana use, but relented after an appeal from Tebow.<ref name=\"swamp\" />  However, after Hernandez's junior year Meyer told him that he would not be welcome back for a fourth year and that he would have to try to get picked up by a professional team in the [[2010 NFL Draft]].<ref name=\"swamp\" /><ref name=\"Gators\" /> Hernandez finished his college career with 111 receptions for 1,382 yards and twelve touchdowns.<ref name=\"Noboa\" /> Florida coaches aligned Hernandez with [[Maurkice Pouncey|Maurkice]] and [[Mike Pouncey]].

On March 17, 2010, Hernandez participated at Florida's pro day and performed all of the combine drills. His time in the 40-yard dash would have ranked fourth among all tight ends at the NFL Combine.

The previous day, the Patriots drafted [[Arizona Wildcats football|Arizona]] [[tight end]] [[Rob Gronkowski]]. Hernandez was the sixth tight end drafted in 2010. Despite his being considered a top tight end prospect, multiple teams reportedly chose not to draft him because \"he was a problem.\"<ref name=\"run\" />\n\nHernandez's draft stock fell due to multiple off-the-field issues during college, rumors of multiple failed drug tests, and character concerns. Multiple teams elected to remove Hernandez from their draft boards entirely due to character concerns, including the [[Indianapolis Colts]], [[Cincinnati Bengals]], and [[Miami Dolphins]].<ref name=\"Wesseling\" /> Hernandez received the lowest possible score in \"social maturity\" in a pre-draft report.<ref name=\"ki2\" /> The Patriots signed [[free agent]] [[Alge Crumpler]] and drafted Hernandez and Gronkowski after they overhauled the tight end position by releasing [[Benjamin Watson]] and opting to not re-sign [[Chris Baker (tight end)|Chris Baker]] and backup [[Michael Matthews (American football)|Michael Matthews]].<ref name=\"preseason\" /><ref name=\"Young\" />\n\nOn April 27, 2010, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported from multiple sources that Hernandez admitted to scouts and team representatives during interviews at the NFL Combine that he had a history of [[marijuana]] use and had failed multiple drug tests while in college.<ref name=\"Breer\" /> Later that day, the Patriots released a statement from Hernandez, who said he had failed only one drug test while in college and was candid about it to interested teams at the NFL Combine.<ref name=\"swamp\" /><ref name=\"Albert\" /> He wrote a letter to every team offering to be tested every other week during his rookie season.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> Patriots owner [[Robert Kraft]] later said, after Hernandez's arrest, that the Patriots drafted him after he gained their trust and said they had \"absolutely nothing to worry about\" in a letter sent to Patriots Director of Player Personnel [[Nick Caserio]] before the draft.<ref name=\"letter\" />\n\nOn June 8, 2010, the Patriots signed Hernandez to a four-year, $2.37 million [[contract]] that included a [[signing bonus]] of $200,000.<ref name=\"uLrpr\" /> The terms of his contract limited Hernandez's signing bonus to $200,000, which was less than half the signing bonus received by Patriots' fourth-round pick (118th overall) [[placekicker]] [[Stephen Gostkowski]] in [[2006 New England Patriots season|2006]]. The Patriots declined to give Hernandez the expected $500,000 signing bonus as a precautionary measure.<ref name=\"0iBg5\" /> To compensate for the smaller signing bonus, he received a contract that included a series of roster and workout bonuses up to an additional $700,000. If Hernandez reached all bonuses and escalators he could receive an annual salary comparable to a third-rounder, but would have to \"walk the straight and narrow line to do so\".<ref name=\"G5zKV\" />\n\n===2010===\nThroughout training camp, Hernandez competed to be a starting tight end against Crumpler, Gronkowski, and [[Rob Myers]]. Hernandez had an impressive preseason alongside Gronkowski.

Hernandez started the 2010 season as the youngest player on any active roster in the NFL.<ref name=\"run\" />\n\nHernandez made his professional regular season debut and first career start in the [[2010 New England Patriots season|Patriots' season-opener]] against the [[2010 Cincinnati Bengals season|Bengals]] and recorded one reception for 45-yards during their 38\u201324 victory.

Together, they combined for 87 receptions for 1,109 receiving yards and 16 receiving touchdowns.\n\nThe Patriots finished the 2010 season first in the [[AFC East]] with a 14\u20132 record and earned a first round [[bye (sports)|bye]]. On January 16, 2011, Hernandez started in his first career playoff game and caught one pass for a four-yard gain as the Patriots lost 28\u201321 against the [[2010 New York Jets|New York Jets]] in the AFC Divisional Round.<ref name=\"5vOfT\" />\n\n===2011===\nOn February 21, 2011, it was reported that Hernandez had undergone hip surgery after injuring it in Week 15.<ref name=\"JGp2A\" /> He entered training camp slated as a backup tight end and competed to be the secondary tight end against Crumpler and [[Lee Smith (American football)|Lee Smith]].\n[[File:Aaron Hernandez cropped.jpg|thumb|Hernandez in December 2011]]\nDuring training camp, wide receiver [[Chad Johnson (wide receiver)|Chad Johnson]] arrived in a trade from the Bengals. Hernandez immediately let Johnson, who then legally had the last name \"Ochocinco\" based on his uniform number, have the No. 85, choosing to go back to his college number of No. 81, which was worn in 2010 by [[wide receiver]] [[Randy Moss]], but became available after Moss was traded to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in 2010.<ref name=\"J4Nnu\" /> Johnson and Hernandez both claimed no compensation was arranged and the transaction was a kind gesture between teammates and nothing more.<ref name=\"money\" /> Hernandez's attorney, [[Jose Baez (lawyer)|Jose Baez]], claimed Hernandez saw an opportunity after the arrival of Johnson and offered No. 85 to Johnson for $75,000.<ref name=\"money\" /> It was claimed by Baez that Johnson countered with a $50,000 offer that Hernandez accepted.<ref name=\"money\" /> The money was reportedly used to finance a wholesale marijuana purchase by Hernandez for his cousin's husband, T.L.

Hernandez also finished 31st in the league with 910 receiving yards and tied for 21st with seven touchdown receptions.<ref name=\"716V9\" />\n\nAccording to [[NBC Sports]], Hernandez and Gronkowski were the first pair of tight-ends in NFL history to catch at least five touchdowns each in consecutive seasons for the same team. In 2011, they also set NFL records for yardage, receptions, and touchdowns by tight ends on one team, combining for 169 receptions, 2,237 yards, and 24 touchdowns. The previous records for receptions and yards by multiple tight ends on a single team were set in [[1984 San Diego Chargers season|1984]] by the [[San Diego Chargers]], who used four tight ends to  combine for 163 receptions and 1,927 yards;<ref name=\"lZaEn\" /> The success of the Hernandez-Gronkowski tandem revolutionized the tight end position.<ref name=\"xZPxH\" /> Multiple teams attempted to recreate the success of the Patriots' \"12 Personnel\" that used two-tight end sets. Hernandez was considered to be the top H-Back in the league in 2011 and the tandem of Hernandez and Gronkowski widely regarded as one of the top offensive tandems in the league.<ref name=\"w86gh\" /> The combination of Hernandez and Gronkowski tied for the most touchdown receptions in 2011 with the [[2011 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers']] wide receiver tandem of [[Jordy Nelson]] and [[Greg Jennings]]. They also had the most receptions of any offensive tandem in 2011 and finished fourth in receiving yards among all offensive tandems. Hernandez and Gronkowski were by far the top tight end combination in 2011. Their 2,237 receiving yards finished first among all tight end tandems in 2011 with the [[2011 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers']] tight end combination of [[Jeremy Shockey]] and [[Greg Olsen (American football)|Greg Olsen]] coming in second with 995 combined receiving yards.<ref name=\"Oc3Py\" /><ref name=\"o0hnQ\" />\n\nThe Patriots finished first in the AFC East with a 13\u20133 record and earned a first round bye.

In addition, he asked Baez to pass along thanks to specific musicians whose songs Hernandez found inspiring.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" /> The other two notes were addressed to Hernandez's fianc\u00e9e and daughter.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" /> In contrast to the straightforward letter to Baez, the lawyer described the other notes as written in a disjointed and markedly \"ominous\" tone.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" /> The letter to his daughter was described by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' as \"strange, rambling, mystical, and tender\".<ref name=\"waste\" /> In these notes, Hernandez described entering a \"timeless realm\" and announced he would see his family in heaven.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" />\n\nPrison officials had not observed any signs that Hernandez was at risk for suicide, so he had not been put on around-the-clock watch.<ref name=\"bbckills\" /> Upon completion of the [[autopsy]] by the medical examiner, the death was officially ruled a [[suicide by hanging]]. At the request of his family, Hernandez's brain was released to [[Boston University]] to be studied for signs of [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease found in people who have had a severe blow or repeated blows to the head, including football players who suffer [[concussion]]s.<ref name=\"waste\" /><ref name=\"CTE\" /> Baez quickly disputed any claim of suicide and stated that he would initiate his own investigation of the death.<ref name=\"shocked\" /> However, in 2018, Baez wrote that he was initially suspicious of the suicide finding, given Hernandez's optimistic demeanor after the acquittal in the double homicide.

It led to issues in his sexuality.\"<ref name=\"Shanahan\" /> SanSoucie stated that Hernandez was terrified that his father would find out about his homosexuality.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAfter listening to more than 300 recorded phone calls, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that Hernandez was \"prone to going on [[homophobia|homophobic]] rants\" and that, in one phone call, he admitted he was attracted to men and said it made him \"angry all the time.\"<ref name=\"room\" /> Patriots receiver [[Brandon Lloyd]] said that he had been warned by teammate [[Wes Welker]] that Hernandez would expose his genitalia and talk about gay sex.<ref name=\"run\" />\n\nProsecutors threatened to raise the issue of his sexuality during the 2012 double homicide trial, a prospect that frightened Hernandez.<ref name=\"room\" /><ref name=\"Shanahan\" /> He wished to keep his sexuality a secret.<ref name=\"bethea\" /> After his death, Jenkins stated that she saw no indication that he was gay.<ref name=\"ormseth\" /><ref name=\"Fiancee\" /> She said, \"I wish I had known how he felt, just so we could have talked about it. I wouldn't have disowned him. I would have been supportive.\"<ref name=\"Fiancee\" />\n\n===Paranoia===\nD.J. described Hernandez as growing increasingly [[paranoia|paranoid]] as an adult, believing the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and others were out to get him.<ref name=\"levenson\" /> D.J. said that Hernandez slept with a large knife by his bed and collected a number of weapons for protection.<ref name=\"levenson\" /> After the [[Aaron Hernandez#2013 Miami shooting of Alexander Bradley|2013 shooting of Alexander Bradley]], Hernandez hired a friend from [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]], [[Connecticut]] to serve as his bodyguard 24 hours a day.<ref name=\"killer\" /> He also began acquiring a large number of weapons and installed a sophisticated surveillance system in his home.<ref name=\"ki3\" /> Shortly thereafter, Hernandez approached Coach [[Bill Belichick]] \"in a state of deepening paranoia,\" saying he feared for his family's safety.<ref name=\"run\" /> Hernandez's agent testified that Hernandez requested the meeting because he was in fear for his life.<ref name=\"killer\" /> Hernandez requested a transfer to a team on the other side of the country, but the request was denied.<ref name=\"killer\" />\n\nIn April 2013, Hernandez purchased a used car with two handguns and two rifles inside.<ref name=\"killer\" /> He also purchased a [[Chevrolet Suburban]] that had been outfitted as an [[Armored car (VIP)|armored car]].<ref name=\"killer\" /> He had secret compartments installed in vehicles to store firearms.<ref name=\"ki2\" /> When being driven, he refused to travel in cars without tinted windows for fear that one of his enemies might see him.<ref name=\"killer\" /> Teammates said that Hernandez was prone to wild mood swings and became more agitated as time went on.<ref name=\"run\" /> He was said to go from being hyper-masculine to talking about cuddling with his mother.<ref name=\"run\" /> As a Patriot, he smoked large quantities of [[marijuana]] and used other drugs, including [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"run\" />\n\n===Brain damage===\nAfter his death, researchers at [[Boston University]] studied Hernandez's brain and diagnosed him with [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), stage 3 of 4,<ref name=\"waste\" /><ref name=\"BU_CTE\" /><ref name=\"belson\" /> and described Hernandez's brain as a classic case of the pathology.<ref name=\"belson\" /><ref name=\"branch\" /><ref name=\"ever\" /> CTE is caused by repeated head trauma.<ref name=\"waste\" /> Hernandez had two confirmed concussions since he began playing football at eight years old, but the ''Boston Globe'' believes \"he undoubtedly took other punishing hits to the head that were never recorded.\"<ref name=\"waste\" /> CTE is associated with cumulative injuries. In a phone conversation recorded in prison, Hernandez said \"I'm like a grandpa. All my bones are so sore.\"<ref name=\"ki2\" />\n\nThe researchers suggested that the CTE, which results in poor judgment, lack of impulse control, or aggression, anger, paranoia, emotional volatility, and rage behaviors, may explain some of Hernandez's criminal acts and other behavior.<ref name=\"waste\" /><ref name=\"BU_CTE\" /> Sam Gandy of [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in New York said, \"It's impossible for me to look at the severity of CTE and Mr. Hernandez's brain and not think that that had a profound effect on his behavior.\"<ref name=\"waste\" /> Hernandez suffered from [[migraine]]s in prison, and had trouble with memory.<ref name=\"waste\" /> Jose Baez wrote that he saw symptoms consistent with CTE from his earliest meetings with Hernandez: Hernandez sometimes showed keen [[insight]] and observational skills, while other times he had gaps in memory that were highly unusual for a young person.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" />\n\nAfter release of the Boston University statement, Hernandez's fianc\u00e9e and daughter sued the Patriots and the NFL for causing Hernandez's death and depriving his daughter of her father's companionship, arguing that Hernandez's NFL career had caused what researchers described as \"the most severe case of [CTE] medically seen\" in a person at his age.<ref name=\"waste\" /><ref name=\"br\" /> The suit was dismissed in February 2019 because the deadline to opt out of a class action suit against the league had been missed.<ref name=\"dale\" />\n\n==In other media==\nHernandez's arrest, conviction, and death attracted a great deal of media attention, especially because of increasing concerns about CTE in athletes. His life was the focus of a 2018 ''[[Boston Globe]]'' Spotlight Team investigation and a podcast called \"Gladiator: Aaron Hernandez & Football, Inc.\"<ref name=\"netflix\" />\n\nA [[Netflix]] documentary entitled ''[[Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez]]'' was released for streaming on January 15, 2020.<ref name=\"netflix\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|American

Hernandez's career came to an abrupt end in 2013 after his arrest and conviction for the [[murder of Odin Lloyd]].\n\nRecognized as an [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] at the [[Florida Gators football|University of Florida]],<ref name=\"Bort\" /> Hernandez was drafted by the Patriots in the fourth round of the [[2010 NFL Draft]]. Alongside teammate [[Rob Gronkowski]], he formed one of the league's most dominant tight-end duos, becoming the first pair of tight ends to score at least five touchdowns each in consecutive seasons for the same team. He made one [[Super Bowl]] appearance in [[Super Bowl XLVI|XLVI]].\n\nDuring the 2013 off-season, Hernandez was arrested and charged for the murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianc\u00e9e. Following his arrest, Hernandez was immediately [[Dismissal (employment)#High-profile firings|released]] by the Patriots. He was found guilty of [[first-degree murder]] in 2015 and sentenced to serve [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life in prison]] without the possibility of [[Parole in the United States|parole]] at the [[Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center]].<ref name=\"guilty\" /> While on trial for Lloyd's murder, he was also [[Indictment#United States|indicted]] for the 2012 double [[homicide]] of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, but he was [[acquitted]] after a 2017 trial.\n\nDays after being acquitted of the double homicide, Hernandez was found dead in his cell. His death was ruled a [[suicide]] by hanging. His conviction for Lloyd's murder was initially [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] under the doctrine of [[abatement ab initio|abatement ''ab initio'']] because Hernandez died during its [[appeal]],<ref name=\"Yan\" /> but it was reinstated in 2019 following an appeal from [[prosecutor]]s and Odin Lloyd's family.<ref name=\"gaffin\" /> After his death, Hernandez was diagnosed with severe [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), which may have affected his actions and emotional stability and may have been a contributing factor in some of his criminal behavior.<ref name=\"waste\" />\n\n== Early life ==\n===Family===\nAaron Josef Hernandez was born in [[Bristol, Connecticut]], and raised on Greystone Avenue.<ref name=\"smile\" /> He was the son of Dennis Hernandez, of Puerto Rican descent, and Terri Valentine-Hernandez, of Italian descent.<ref name=\"smile\" /> As an adult, Hernandez remembered his mother throwing his father out of the house on multiple occasions, but always letting him back in.<ref name=\"smile\" /> The couple married in 1986, divorced in 1991, and remarried in 1996.<ref name=\"smile\" /> In 1991, they filed for [[bankruptcy]].<ref name=\"smile\" /> Hernandez would later state there was constant fighting going on in the home.<ref name=\"smile\" /> Both parents would be arrested and involved in crime during their lives.<ref name=\"smile\" />\n\nHernandez had an older brother, Dennis Jonathan Jr., known as D.J.<ref name=\"smile\" /> Their father pushed them to excel, including through sports, but was often [[domestic abuse|abusive]] towards both the boys and their mother.<ref name=\"smile\" /><ref name=\"levenson\" /> Publicly, their father projected an image of someone who had some run-ins with the police but turned his life around to become a good father and citizen.<ref name=\"smile\" />\n\nHernandez's father died in January 2006, from complications from [[hernia]] surgery, when Hernandez was 16.<ref name=\"Varela\" /> According to his mother, Hernandez was greatly affected by his father's death, and he acted out his grief by rebelling against authority figures.<ref name=\"kelly\" /><ref name=\"Reynolds\" /> Those who knew him said he never got over his father's death.<ref name=\"smile\" />\n\nHernandez became [[family estrangement|estranged]] from his mother, and largely moved in with Tanya Singleton, his older cousin.<ref name=\"smile\" /> Following Dennis' death, the family learned that Terri Hernandez and Singleton's husband, Jeff Cummings, had been having an [[extramarital affair]].<ref name=\"smile\" /><ref name=\"swamp\" /> After the affair became public, Singleton and Cummings divorced, and Cummings moved in with Terri.<ref name=\"smile\" /> This \"enraged\" Hernandez.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> It was while he was living with Singleton that Hernandez became more involved in criminal activity.<ref name=\"smile\" />\n\nIn a jailhouse conversation, Hernandez accused his mother, Terri, of failing to obtain medication for his [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], which he said caused him to struggle in school.<ref name=\"smile\" /> In another call, he told her, \"There's so many things I would love to talk to you [about], so you can know me as a person. But I never could tell you. And you're gonna die without even knowing your son.\"<ref name=\"smile\" />\n\n===Abuse===\nThe beatings Hernandez's father gave him and his brother were sometimes for no reason at all or were alcohol-related, but often came when their father believed they were not trying hard enough in school or athletics.<ref name=\"smile\" /> D.J. and Hernandez lived in constant fear of their father, but also revered him.<ref name=\"smile\" /><ref name=\"levenson\" /> Hernandez once came to school with a [[black eye]] that his coach believed resulted from his father hitting him.<ref name=\"smile\" /> His father once punched Hernandez's youth football coach after a dispute about coaching methods.<ref name=\"smile\" />\n\nAccording to Hernandez's brother D.J., Hernandez was also [[Child sexual abuse|sexually molested]] as a child.<ref name=\"smile\" /><ref name=\"levenson\" /> A teenage boy in his babysitter's house forced Hernandez to perform [[oral sex]] on him beginning when Hernandez was six years old and continuing for several years.<ref name=\"levenson\" /><ref name=\"ki3\" /> \n\n===High school football career===\nHernandez attended [[Bristol Central High School]], where he played for the Bristol Rams [[high school football|football]] team.<ref name=\"ki1\" /> He was also an exceptional basketball player and track runner.<ref name=\"ki1\" /> He started as a [[wide receiver]] before becoming a [[tight end]], and also played [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"ufprofile\" /> As a senior, he was Connecticut's [[Gatorade Player of the Year awards|Gatorade Football Player of the Year]] after making 67 [[reception (American football)|receptions]] for 1,807 yards and 24 [[touchdown]]s on offense and 72 [[Tackle (football move)|tackles]], twelve [[Quarterback sack|sacks]], three forced [[fumble]]s, two fumble recoveries, and four blocked kicks on defense.<ref name=\"ufprofile\" /><ref name=\"ki1\" /> He was also a [[All-American Bowl (high school football)|US Army All-American]].<ref name=\"ki1\" />\n\nThe 1,807 receiving yards and 24 touchdowns were state records.<ref name=\"smile\" /> Hernandez's 31 career touchdowns tied the state record. He also set the state record for receiving yards in a single game with 376, the seventh-best in national high school history; he set a national high school record for yards receiving per game with 180.7. Hernandez was considered the top tight-end recruit in 2007 by [[Scout.com]].<ref name=\"Scout\" /> He was not known for working hard as a child, but by high school, when he was nearly 6'2\" tall, he worked harder than anyone else on the team.<ref name=\"smile\" />\n\nDuring one game in 2006, Hernandez took a blindside hit to the head so hard that he was knocked out cold.<ref name=\"smile\" /> An ambulance had to take him off the field.<ref name=\"smile\" />\n\n=== Social life ===\nHernandez was popular in school.<ref name=\"smile\" /> He first began dating his future fianc\u00e9e, Shayanna Jenkins, during high school.<ref name=\"smile\" /><ref name=\"run\" /> The two had known each other since elementary school.<ref name=\"run\" /> He also smoked a large quantity of [[marijuana]], smoking before school, practices, and games.<ref name=\"smile\" /> His social life included \"a sizable amount of drinking\" in addition to the marijuana.<ref name=\"smile\" />\n\n== College career ==\n\n=== Recruitment ===\nAt first, Hernandez committed to play at the [[University of Connecticut]]<ref name=\"kelly\" /> with his brother D.J., but ultimately chose to play for the [[University of Florida]] under head coach [[Urban Meyer]].<ref name=\"smile\" /><ref name=\"ufmediaguide\" /> Meyer flew to Connecticut and convinced Hernandez's principal to allow him to graduate more than a semester early.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> This allowed Hernandez to move to Florida, join the team, and learn the playbook shortly after his 17th birthday.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' later opined that {{quote|There was no way, except physically, he was ready for this. The young man who came to [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] wasn't academically prepared or emotionally grounded for college life, according to previously undisclosed college records and recordings of phone calls Hernandez later made from jail. He had graduated high school more than a semester early \u2014 not because he was a great student but because he was a great football player. ... The athletic gifts were obvious, but behind them was an angry teenager struggling with an abusive upbringing, a growing dependence on drugs, and questions about his own sexual identity.<ref name=\"swamp\" />}} Meyer was aided in the recruitment by [[Steve Addazio]], a Connecticut native, and Florida quarterback [[Tim Tebow]].<ref name=\"swamp\" /> Addazio and Meyer told Hernandez that they believed he had the potential to play in the [[National Football League]] (NFL).<ref name=\"swamp\" /> Hernandez's principal later said that the two were persuasive and heavily pressured Hernandez, but in retrospect that it was a mistake to allow him to graduate early.<ref name=\"swamp\" />\n\nHernandez was not academically prepared for college and had to take remedial courses at [[Santa Fe Community College (Florida)|Santa Fe Community College]].<ref name=\"swamp\" /> Many of his teammates, particularly those whom Meyer convinced to come to Gainesville early, did likewise.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> Meyer later said that he found Hernandez to be \"a distressed person\" when he arrived on campus and tried to steer him in the right direction.<ref name=\"swamp\" />\n\n=== Florida Gators football ===\nBetween practices, games, team meetings, and other events, Hernandez put 40 to 60 hours a week into football, nearly year-round.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> He later said that he was high on drugs every time he took the field.<ref name=\"swamp\" />\n\nAs a freshman in [[2007 Florida Gators football team|2007]], Hernandez started three games for the Florida Gators. He finished the season with nine receptions for 151 yards and two touchdowns. Though he excelled his freshman year, he was benched in the season opener of his sophomore year due to a failed drug test.<ref name=\"swamp\" />  Following that, he started eleven of thirteen games during the [[2008 Florida Gators football team|2008 season]] in place of the injured [[Cornelius Ingram]], and finished the season with 34 receptions for 381 yards and five touchdowns. In the [[2009 BCS National Championship Game]] against the [[2008 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma Sooners]], Hernandez led the Gators in receiving yards with 57 on five receptions, as the Gators defeated the Sooners 24\u201314 to win their second BCS championship in three seasons.<ref name=\"Tebow\" />\n\nAs a junior in [[2009 Florida Gators football team|2009]], and after leading the team in receptions with 68 for 850 yards and five touchdowns, Hernandez won the [[John Mackey Award]] given annually to the nation's best tight end.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> He was also a first-team All-[[Southeastern Conference]] selection and was recognized as a first-team [[2009 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] by the [[Associated Press]], ''[[College Football News]]'' and ''[[The Sporting News]].''<ref name=\"ufmediaguide\" /> During his final game, he threw the ball into the stands to celebrate a touchdown.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> The [[Touchdown celebration#NCAA football|excessive display risked a personal foul penalty]], but sportswriters saw an athlete with little to lose personally if he chose to go into the NFL instead of returning for another year of collegiate football.\n\nMeyer had wanted to throw Hernandez off the team for his chronic marijuana use, but relented after an appeal from Tebow.<ref name=\"swamp\" />  However, after Hernandez's junior year Meyer told him that he would not be welcome back for a fourth year and that he would have to try to get picked up by a professional team in the [[2010 NFL Draft]].<ref name=\"swamp\" /><ref name=\"Gators\" /> Hernandez finished his college career with 111 receptions for 1,382 yards and twelve touchdowns.<ref name=\"Noboa\" /> Florida coaches aligned Hernandez with [[Maurkice Pouncey|Maurkice]] and [[Mike Pouncey]]. He reportedly grew close with the twins after rooming with them and staff considered the Pounceys a positive influence on Hernandez.<ref name=\"entry\" />\n\n=== Academics ===\nHernandez was always trying to be \"the life of the party,\" according to a teammate.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> His classes his first year included [[bowling]], theater appreciation, wildlife issues, and a course entitled \"plants, gardening and you.\"<ref name=\"swamp\" /> During his first semester, he largely earned Bs.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> He made the conference honor roll during his sophomore year, but as a junior got a D in a class on poverty and did not complete his second attempt at an introductory statistics class.<ref name=\"swamp\" />\n\n== Professional career ==\nOn January 6, 2010, Hernandez announced his decision to forgo his remaining eligibility and enter the [[2010 NFL Draft]].<ref name=\"early\" /> He attended the [[NFL Scouting Combine]], but was unable to perform any physical drills after tearing a muscle in his back during the offseason. On March 17, 2010, Hernandez participated at Florida's pro day and performed all of the combine drills. His time in the 40-yard dash would have ranked fourth among all tight ends at the NFL Combine. Hernandez also performed 30 repetitions of 225 pounds on the [[bench press]] and would have been the top performance of all tight ends, surpassing [[Dennis Pitta]]'s top performance of 27 repetitions.<ref name=\"Numbers\" /><ref name=\"Combine\" /> \n{{external media \n| video1 =\n[http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-videos/09000d5d8177eb75/2010-Draft-Vignettes-Aaron-Hernandez-Florida 2010 NFL Draft Profile: Aaron Hernandez]\n}}\nNFL analyst [[Mike Mayock]] stated \"off the field concerns\" and concerns over Hernandez' physical size were hurting his draft stock, but believed Hernandez would still be drafted in the second round.<ref name=\"SBNation\" /> At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, he was projected to be a second round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts.

The previous day, the Patriots drafted [[Arizona Wildcats football|Arizona]] [[tight end]] [[Rob Gronkowski]]. Hernandez was the sixth tight end drafted in 2010. Despite his being considered a top tight end prospect, multiple teams reportedly chose not to draft him because \"he was a problem.\"<ref name=\"run\" />\n\nHernandez's draft stock fell due to multiple off-the-field issues during college, rumors of multiple failed drug tests, and character concerns. Multiple teams elected to remove Hernandez from their draft boards entirely due to character concerns, including the [[Indianapolis Colts]], [[Cincinnati Bengals]], and [[Miami Dolphins]].<ref name=\"Wesseling\" /> Hernandez received the lowest possible score in \"social maturity\" in a pre-draft report.<ref name=\"ki2\" /> The Patriots signed [[free agent]] [[Alge Crumpler]] and drafted Hernandez and Gronkowski after they overhauled the tight end position by releasing [[Benjamin Watson]] and opting to not re-sign [[Chris Baker (tight end)|Chris Baker]] and backup [[Michael Matthews (American football)|Michael Matthews]].<ref name=\"preseason\" /><ref name=\"Young\" />\n\nOn April 27, 2010, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported from multiple sources that Hernandez admitted to scouts and team representatives during interviews at the NFL Combine that he had a history of [[marijuana]] use and had failed multiple drug tests while in college.<ref name=\"Breer\" /> Later that day, the Patriots released a statement from Hernandez, who said he had failed only one drug test while in college and was candid about it to interested teams at the NFL Combine.<ref name=\"swamp\" /><ref name=\"Albert\" /> He wrote a letter to every team offering to be tested every other week during his rookie season.<ref name=\"swamp\" /> Patriots owner [[Robert Kraft]] later said, after Hernandez's arrest, that the Patriots drafted him after he gained their trust and said they had \"absolutely nothing to worry about\" in a letter sent to Patriots Director of Player Personnel [[Nick Caserio]] before the draft.<ref name=\"letter\" />\n\nOn June 8, 2010, the Patriots signed Hernandez to a four-year, $2.37 million [[contract]] that included a [[signing bonus]] of $200,000.<ref name=\"uLrpr\" /> The terms of his contract limited Hernandez's signing bonus to $200,000, which was less than half the signing bonus received by Patriots' fourth-round pick (118th overall) [[placekicker]] [[Stephen Gostkowski]] in [[2006 New England Patriots season|2006]]. The Patriots declined to give Hernandez the expected $500,000 signing bonus as a precautionary measure.<ref name=\"0iBg5\" /> To compensate for the smaller signing bonus, he received a contract that included a series of roster and workout bonuses up to an additional $700,000. If Hernandez reached all bonuses and escalators he could receive an annual salary comparable to a third-rounder, but would have to \"walk the straight and narrow line to do so\".<ref name=\"G5zKV\" />\n\n===2010===\nThroughout training camp, Hernandez competed to be a starting tight end against Crumpler, Gronkowski, and [[Rob Myers]]. Hernandez had an impressive preseason alongside Gronkowski. Their preseason performance would ultimately foreshadow their future success as one of the top tight end tandems in league history.<ref name=\"preseason\" /> Head coach [[Bill Belichick]] named Hernandez the third tight end on the Patriots depth chart, behind Crumpler and Gronkowski.<ref name=\"xYM8E\" /> Hernandez was used as the receiving tight end option with Crumpler inserted for plays that required [[Blocking (American football)|blocking]]. Hernandez started the 2010 season as the youngest player on any active roster in the NFL.<ref name=\"run\" />\n\nHernandez made his professional regular season debut and first career start in the [[2010 New England Patriots season|Patriots' season-opener]] against the [[2010 Cincinnati Bengals season|Bengals]] and recorded one reception for 45-yards during their 38\u201324 victory. On September 19, 2010, he caught a season-high six receptions for a total of 101 receiving yards during the Patriots' 28\u201314 loss at the [[2010 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] in Week 2. Hernandez became the youngest player since 1960 to have more than 100 receiving yards in a single game. In Week 3, Hernandez led all Patriots receivers with six catches for 65-yards during a 38\u201330 win against the [[2010 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]]. He also had his first career carry for a three-yard gain against the Bills in Week 3. On November 7, 2010, Hernandez caught five passes for 48-yards and scored the first two touchdowns of his career during a 34\u201314 loss at the [[2010 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]] in Week 9. He caught his first career [[touchdown]] on a two-yard pass by Patriots' [[quarterback]] [[Tom Brady]] during the second quarter. His second touchdown of the game was scored on a one-yard pass by Brady in the fourth quarter.<ref name=\"3JLX2\" />\n\nOn December 19, 2010, Hernandez made four catches for 31-yards and  caught two touchdown passes in the Patriots' 31\u201327 win against the [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] in Week 15.<ref name=\"1Qcna\" /><ref name=\"iBRt9\" /> His two-touchdown performance earned him the [[Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week]]. Hernandez was inactive for the last two games of the regular season (Weeks 16\u201317) due to a hip injury.<ref name=\"injury\" /> He finished his rookie season in [[2010 NFL season|2010]] with 45 receptions for 563 receiving yards and six touchdown receptions 14 games and seven starts.<ref name=\"eTe5B\" /> Hernandez and Gronkowski began having success as Belichick increased the use of two-tight end sets to capitalize on their exceptional receiving ability. Together, they combined for 87 receptions for 1,109 receiving yards and 16 receiving touchdowns.\n\nThe Patriots finished the 2010 season first in the [[AFC East]] with a 14\u20132 record and earned a first round [[bye (sports)|bye]]. On January 16, 2011, Hernandez started in his first career playoff game and caught one pass for a four-yard gain as the Patriots lost 28\u201321 against the [[2010 New York Jets|New York Jets]] in the AFC Divisional Round.<ref name=\"5vOfT\" />\n\n===2011===\nOn February 21, 2011, it was reported that Hernandez had undergone hip surgery after injuring it in Week 15.<ref name=\"JGp2A\" /> He entered training camp slated as a backup tight end and competed to be the secondary tight end against Crumpler and [[Lee Smith (American football)|Lee Smith]].\n[[File:Aaron Hernandez cropped.jpg|thumb|Hernandez in December 2011]]\nDuring training camp, wide receiver [[Chad Johnson (wide receiver)|Chad Johnson]] arrived in a trade from the Bengals. Hernandez immediately let Johnson, who then legally had the last name \"Ochocinco\" based on his uniform number, have the No. 85, choosing to go back to his college number of No. 81, which was worn in 2010 by [[wide receiver]] [[Randy Moss]], but became available after Moss was traded to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in 2010.<ref name=\"J4Nnu\" /> Johnson and Hernandez both claimed no compensation was arranged and the transaction was a kind gesture between teammates and nothing more.<ref name=\"money\" /> Hernandez's attorney, [[Jose Baez (lawyer)|Jose Baez]], claimed Hernandez saw an opportunity after the arrival of Johnson and offered No. 85 to Johnson for $75,000.<ref name=\"money\" /> It was claimed by Baez that Johnson countered with a $50,000 offer that Hernandez accepted.<ref name=\"money\" /> The money was reportedly used to finance a wholesale marijuana purchase by Hernandez for his cousin's husband, T.L. Singleton, who later paid Hernandez back $120,000 for the loan.<ref name=\"money\" />\n\nBelichick named Hernandez the secondary starting tight end to start the regular season, alongside primary tight end Gronkowski.<ref name=\"HkGbl\" /> Belichick continued to increase the use of the Patriots \"12 personnel\" and began using Hernandez as an H-back lined up in the slot to dictate pass coverages.<ref name=\"8iFpe\" /> He started in the [[2011 New England Patriots season|Patriots' 2011 season-opener]] at the [[2011 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] and caught seven passes for 103-yards and scored on a one-yard touchdown pass by Brady during the third quarter of a 38\u201324 victory.<ref name=\"ZfIRt\" /> The following week, Hernandez made seven receptions for 62-yards and a touchdown before exiting in the third quarter of the Patriots' 35\u201321 win against the [[2011 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] due to a knee injury.

Hernandez was perceived as a snub for the Pro Bowl by many analysts who argued he was more deserving than San Diego Chargers' tight end [[Antonio Gates]].<ref name=\"vsZDK\" /> He finished the season with a career-high 79 receptions for 910 receiving yards and seven touchdown receptions in 14 games and 12 starts.<ref name=\"career\" /> Hernandez ranked 15th among all players in receptions in 2011 and fifth among tight ends. New England Patriots' wide receiver [[Wes Welker]] finished first in the league with 122 receptions and Gronkowski finished fifth among all players with 90 total receptions in 2011. Hernandez also finished 31st in the league with 910 receiving yards and tied for 21st with seven touchdown receptions.<ref name=\"716V9\" />\n\nAccording to [[NBC Sports]], Hernandez and Gronkowski were the first pair of tight-ends in NFL history to catch at least five touchdowns each in consecutive seasons for the same team.

The previous records for receptions and yards by multiple tight ends on a single team were set in [[1984 San Diego Chargers season|1984]] by the [[San Diego Chargers]], who used four tight ends to  combine for 163 receptions and 1,927 yards;<ref name=\"lZaEn\" /> The success of the Hernandez-Gronkowski tandem revolutionized the tight end position.<ref name=\"xZPxH\" /> Multiple teams attempted to recreate the success of the Patriots' \"12 Personnel\" that used two-tight end sets. Hernandez was considered to be the top H-Back in the league in 2011 and the tandem of Hernandez and Gronkowski widely regarded as one of the top offensive tandems in the league.<ref name=\"w86gh\" /> The combination of Hernandez and Gronkowski tied for the most touchdown receptions in 2011 with the [[2011 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers']] wide receiver tandem of [[Jordy Nelson]] and [[Greg Jennings]]. They also had the most receptions of any offensive tandem in 2011 and finished fourth in receiving yards among all offensive tandems. Hernandez and Gronkowski were by far the top tight end combination in 2011. Their 2,237 receiving yards finished first among all tight end tandems in 2011 with the [[2011 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers']] tight end combination of [[Jeremy Shockey]] and [[Greg Olsen (American football)|Greg Olsen]] coming in second with 995 combined receiving yards.<ref name=\"Oc3Py\" /><ref name=\"o0hnQ\" />\n\nThe Patriots finished first in the AFC East with a 13\u20133 record and earned a first round bye.

Although Carson initially identified Hernandez as such, other witnesses that night described the shooter as looking like a black male, possibly with cornrows. When Mullins re-interviewed Carson, Carson rescinded his statement of the shooter matching Hernandez and said he never saw Hernandez at the scene, but assumed he was the shooter because \"they had words earlier at the club.\" <ref name=\"2KeRw\" />\n\n===2011 Plainville fight===\nAt 3:45&nbsp;a.m. on April 30, 2011, police responded to a fight in front of Hernandez's rented townhouse in [[Plainville, Massachusetts]].<ref name=\"run\" /> A high school friend had been pulled over earlier in the evening after driving Hernandez home from a Boston bar.<ref name=\"run\" /> The driver was weaving in and out of lanes and traveling at 120 miles per hour in a work zone and on a highway with a speed limit of 55 miles per hour.<ref name=\"run\" />  The [[Massachusetts State Police|Massachusetts State Trooper]] who pulled the car over did not arrest the driver because he recognized Hernandez in the passenger seat.<ref name=\"run\" /> The Plainville police also recognized Hernandez, and told the two to go indoors.<ref name=\"run\" />\n\n=== 2012 Boston double homicide ===\nHernandez was investigated in connection with a double homicide that took place on July 16, 2012, near the Cure Lounge in Boston's [[South End, Boston|South End]].<ref name=\"killer\" /><ref name=\"steC1\" /> Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, both immigrants from [[Cape Verde]] and living in [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]], were killed by gunshots fired into their vehicle.<ref name=\"cbsnews\" /> Witnesses testified that Hernandez's silver SUV pulled up next to the victims and someone from his car yelled, \"What's up now, [[nigger]]s?\"<ref name=\"cbsnews\" /> Someone from the car then fired five shots, killing the two immigrants.<ref name=\"cbsnews\" /> Police immediately identified Hernandez, who was then playing for the Patriots, in the club's security camera footage, but thought it was a coincidence that the NFL star happened to be at the club that evening.<ref name=\"cbsnews\" />\n\nOn May 15, 2014, Hernandez was [[indictment|indicted]] on murder charges for the killings of de Abreu and Furtado,<ref name=\"qgBYJ\" /> with additional charges of armed assault and [[attempted murder]] associated with shots fired at the surviving occupants in the vehicle.<ref name=\"ZG5Ok\" /> The trial began March 1, 2017.<ref name=\"Spwpg\" /> The [[prosecution]] case was strongly based on testimony by Bradley, a known drug dealer who had been feuding with Hernandez since the NFL player allegedly shot him in the face and left him to die.<ref name=\"room\" /> Hernandez and Bradley each claimed the other person pulled the trigger.<ref name=\"cbsnews\" />\n\n[[Jose Baez (lawyer)|Jose Baez]], Hernandez's attorney, argued that the proposed motive was implausible, and Hernandez was a suspect of convenience to close two unsolved murders.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" /> Bradley alleged that Hernandez was angered after the victims spilled a drink on him at a nightclub several hours before the shooting and killed them in retaliation.<ref name=\"killer\" /> Security camera footage confirmed Hernandez was in the club for less than ten minutes.<ref name=\"killer\" /> In that time he calmly posed for a photo with a fan, and left by himself \u2014 contradicting Bradley's testimony that he departed with Hernandez.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" /> Furthermore, Baez characterized the police investigation as extraordinarily sloppy (e.g., the victims' bodies were kept in their bullet-riddled vehicle as it was towed away from the shooting scene, a major protocol violation) with no physical evidence tying Hernandez to the murders.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" />\n\nAccording to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', there is \"powerful evidence that [Hernandez] was at the scene and played a role in their deaths.\"<ref name=\"waste\" /> On April 14, 2017, Hernandez was [[acquittal|acquitted]] of the murders and most of the other charges but found guilty of illegal possession of a handgun.<ref name=\"tfu3P\" />\n\n=== 2013 traffic stop ===\nIn January 2013, Hernandez and Bradley partied at Cure again.<ref name=\"cbsnews\" />  At 2:20&nbsp;a.m., Bradley was pulled over on the [[Southeast Expressway (Boston)|Southeast Expressway]] doing 105 miles per hour.<ref name=\"cbsnews\" />  According to the State Police he was \"wobbly drunk.\"<ref name=\"cbsnews\" /> Hernandez tried to get his friend out of trouble by saying, \"Trooper, I am Aaron Hernandez.

The attorney representing the Lloyd family, Thomas M. Quinn, III, argued that Hernandez was rightfully convicted of Lloyd's murder and that the conviction was unfairly wiped out. Quinn also argued that Hernandez killed himself knowing of the technicality that would get his conviction thrown out, and that, \"He should not be able to accomplish in death, what he never would have been able to do in life.\" (159)\n\nOn March 13, 2019, the Supreme Judicial Court reinstated Hernandez's conviction, but stated that the trial record would note that his conviction was \"neither affirmed nor reversed\"; the appeal was rendered [[Mootness|moot]] because Hernandez died while the case was on appeal.<ref name=\"KqEcE\" /> The Court, in their ruling, also officially ended the practice of abatement ''ab initio'', ruling that it was outdated, never made sense, and that it was \"no longer consonant with the circumstances of contemporary life, if, in fact, it ever was.\" After the ruling, Hernandez' estate vowed to appeal the ruling further.\n\n== Prison ==\n''[[The Boston Globe]]'' described Hernandez as being \"strangely content\" while in jail, an attitude that confounded his fianc\u00e9e Shayanna Jenkins.<ref name=\"room\" /> He told his mother that, \"I've been the most relaxed and less stressed in jail than I have out of jail.\"<ref name=\"room\" /> He was, however, punished on multiple occasions for breaking prison rules, including screaming and banging on his cell door.<ref name=\"room\" />  Over the course of his four years behind bars, he increasingly turned to the [[Bible]] and became more religious.<ref name=\"room\" /> The ''Globe'' said that prison officials \"seemed to turn a blind eye to Hernandez's drug use [and] neglected to safeguard their famous inmate.\"<ref name=\"room\" />\n\nHernandez could speak to Jenkins on the phone, and often did twice a day, but she was facing [[perjury]] charges related to his arrest.<ref name=\"room\" /> He only saw his daughter when Jenkins' mother brought her to visit.<ref name=\"room\" /> While in prison, he reconciled with his own mother, from whom he had been [[family estrangement|estranged]] for many years.<ref name=\"room\" />\n\nWhile being held at the [[Bristol County Jail]], Hernandez was kept in a segregated unit, an \"especially grim section\" that normally housed the [[mental illness|mentally ill]] and violent.<ref name=\"room\" /> He asked to move out of segregation, but Sheriff [[Thomas M. Hodgson]] would not allow it.<ref name=\"room\" /> Hernandez believed that Hodgson exploited his incarceration for publicity.<ref name=\"calls\" />\n\nAfter his conviction for the murder of Lloyd, Hernandez was transferred to the [[Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center]], a [[Maximum security prison|maximum security]] prison where inmates typically spend twenty hours a day in their cells.<ref name=\"room\" /> In the two years he spent in the prison, Hernandez was disciplined dozens of times.<ref name=\"room\" /> His lawyer claimed that he was taunted relentlessly by guards.<ref name=\"room\" /> While in prison, Hernandez continued to work out and anticipated returning to the NFL.<ref name=\"calls\" />\n\nTwo days before his death, reporter [[Michele McPhee]] appeared on the ''[[Kirk and Callahan]]'' [[sports radio]] show, during which she and the two hosts used [[innuendo]] to imply that Hernandez was gay.<ref name=\"bethea\" /> It has been suggested that this outing may have played a role in Hernandez's suicide.<ref name=\"bethea\" />\n\n== Death ==\nOn April 19, 2017, at 3:05&nbsp;am [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]\u2014five days after Hernandez was acquitted of the 2012 Boston double homicide of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado\u2014correction officers found Hernandez [[hanging]] by his bedsheets from the window in his cell at the [[Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center]] in [[Lancaster, Massachusetts|Lancaster]], [[Massachusetts]]. He was transported to [[UMass Memorial Health Care#Facilities|UMass Memorial Hospital-Leominster]], where he was pronounced dead at 4:07&nbsp;am.<ref name=\"globe-2017-04-19\" /><ref name=\"cnn-death\" /><ref name=\"bostonherald-death\" /><ref name=\"auto\" /> He had been smoking [[Synthetic cannabinoids|K2]], a drug associated with [[psychosis]], within thirty hours of his death.<ref name=\"waste\" />\n\nState Department of Correction spokesman Christopher Fallon first said that no [[suicide note]] was found in the initial search of the two-person cell, which Hernandez occupied alone.<ref name=\"IMH1s\" /> [[Shampoo]] was found covering the floor, [[cardboard]] was wedged under the cell door to make it difficult for someone to enter, and there were drawings in blood on the walls showing an unfinished pyramid and the [[Eye of Providence|all-seeing eye of God]], with the word \"[[Illuminati]]\" written in capital letters underneath.<ref name=\"eye\" /> On April 20, 2017, investigators reported that three handwritten notes were next to a [[Bible]] opened to [[John 3:16]] and that \"John 3:16\" was written on his forehead in red ink.<ref name=\"found\" />\n\n[[Jose Baez (lawyer)|Jose Baez]], Hernandez's attorney, reprinted the contents of the notes in his 2018 book ''Unnecessary Roughness''.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" /> One short letter was addressed to Baez, thanking him for securing the acquittal in the double homicide and anticipating an appeal in the Odin Lloyd case. In addition, he asked Baez to pass along thanks to specific musicians whose songs Hernandez found inspiring.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" /> The other two notes were addressed to Hernandez's fianc\u00e9e and daughter.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" /> In contrast to the straightforward letter to Baez, the lawyer described the other notes as written in a disjointed and markedly \"ominous\" tone.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" /> The letter to his daughter was described by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' as \"strange, rambling, mystical, and tender\".<ref name=\"waste\" /> In these notes, Hernandez described entering a \"timeless realm\" and announced he would see his family in heaven.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" />\n\nPrison officials had not observed any signs that Hernandez was at risk for suicide, so he had not been put on around-the-clock watch.<ref name=\"bbckills\" /> Upon completion of the [[autopsy]] by the medical examiner, the death was officially ruled a [[suicide by hanging]]. At the request of his family, Hernandez's brain was released to [[Boston University]] to be studied for signs of [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease found in people who have had a severe blow or repeated blows to the head, including football players who suffer [[concussion]]s.<ref name=\"waste\" /><ref name=\"CTE\" /> Baez quickly disputed any claim of suicide and stated that he would initiate his own investigation of the death.<ref name=\"shocked\" /> However, in 2018, Baez wrote that he was initially suspicious of the suicide finding, given Hernandez's optimistic demeanor after the acquittal in the double homicide. But he later came to believe Hernandez had taken his own life, with CTE being a major contributing factor.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n===Relationships===\nIn 2007, Hernandez began dating Shayanna Jenkins, a girl he had known since elementary school. Their daughter was born in 2012,<ref name=\"cbsboston\" /> the same month that the couple became engaged and that Hernandez purchased a $1.3&nbsp;million, {{convert|8130|sqfoot|sqm}}, four-story home with an in-ground pool in [[North Attleborough, Massachusetts|North Attleborough]], [[Massachusetts]], where the family lived together.<ref name=\"run\" /><ref name=\"McLaughlin\" /> Jenkins moved in with Hernandez in 2011, during his second season with the Patriots.<ref name=\"run\" />\n\nAfter she discovered him cheating on her, Jenkins moved out but returned in the summer of 2012.<ref name=\"run\" /> During Hernandez's trial for the murder of Odin Lloyd, it was claimed that Hernandez had flirted with and kissed the nanny who took care of his daughter.<ref name=\"wetzel\" /> Jenkins testified in court that she wanted to make their relationship work, and that it required her to compromise on some of his behavior.<ref name=\"shayanna\" /> She told police that she cooked and cleaned and she knew her role.<ref name=\"run\" /> Hernandez and Jenkins never married.<ref name=\"40Q3B\" />\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nFollowing Hernandez's death, a high school teammate, Dennis SanSoucie, described a secret [[homosexual]] relationship between the two between the 7th and 11th grades.<ref name=\"smile\" /><ref name=\"ki1\" /> The teammate stated that Hernandez had many sexual partners during this time.<ref name=\"ki1\" /> Hernandez's brother D.J., mother Terri, and attorney George Leontire report that Hernandez came out as gay to his mother and ex-girlfriend while in prison.<ref name=\"levenson\" /><ref name=\"room\" /><ref name=\"calls\" /><ref name=\"ormseth\" /> Leontire, who is also gay,<ref name=\"ki3\" /> said his client \"clearly was gay\" and described the \"immense pain that it caused him\" and the self-hatred that came from growing up in a culture that was anti-gay.<ref name=\"Shanahan\" /> According to Leontire, Hernandez believed that the sexual abuse he experienced as a boy caused him to become gay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> A college girlfriend said that \"he never dealt with [the sexual abuse]. It led to issues in his sexuality.\"<ref name=\"Shanahan\" /> SanSoucie stated that Hernandez was terrified that his father would find out about his homosexuality.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAfter listening to more than 300 recorded phone calls, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported that Hernandez was \"prone to going on [[homophobia|homophobic]] rants\" and that, in one phone call, he admitted he was attracted to men and said it made him \"angry all the time.\"<ref name=\"room\" /> Patriots receiver [[Brandon Lloyd]] said that he had been warned by teammate [[Wes Welker]] that Hernandez would expose his genitalia and talk about gay sex.<ref name=\"run\" />\n\nProsecutors threatened to raise the issue of his sexuality during the 2012 double homicide trial, a prospect that frightened Hernandez.<ref name=\"room\" /><ref name=\"Shanahan\" /> He wished to keep his sexuality a secret.<ref name=\"bethea\" /> After his death, Jenkins stated that she saw no indication that he was gay.<ref name=\"ormseth\" /><ref name=\"Fiancee\" /> She said, \"I wish I had known how he felt, just so we could have talked about it. I wouldn't have disowned him. I would have been supportive.\"<ref name=\"Fiancee\" />\n\n===Paranoia===\nD.J. described Hernandez as growing increasingly [[paranoia|paranoid]] as an adult, believing the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and others were out to get him.<ref name=\"levenson\" /> D.J. said that Hernandez slept with a large knife by his bed and collected a number of weapons for protection.<ref name=\"levenson\" /> After the [[Aaron Hernandez#2013 Miami shooting of Alexander Bradley|2013 shooting of Alexander Bradley]], Hernandez hired a friend from [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]], [[Connecticut]] to serve as his bodyguard 24 hours a day.<ref name=\"killer\" /> He also began acquiring a large number of weapons and installed a sophisticated surveillance system in his home.<ref name=\"ki3\" /> Shortly thereafter, Hernandez approached Coach [[Bill Belichick]] \"in a state of deepening paranoia,\" saying he feared for his family's safety.<ref name=\"run\" /> Hernandez's agent testified that Hernandez requested the meeting because he was in fear for his life.<ref name=\"killer\" /> Hernandez requested a transfer to a team on the other side of the country, but the request was denied.<ref name=\"killer\" />\n\nIn April 2013, Hernandez purchased a used car with two handguns and two rifles inside.<ref name=\"killer\" /> He also purchased a [[Chevrolet Suburban]] that had been outfitted as an [[Armored car (VIP)|armored car]].<ref name=\"killer\" /> He had secret compartments installed in vehicles to store firearms.<ref name=\"ki2\" /> When being driven, he refused to travel in cars without tinted windows for fear that one of his enemies might see him.<ref name=\"killer\" /> Teammates said that Hernandez was prone to wild mood swings and became more agitated as time went on.<ref name=\"run\" /> He was said to go from being hyper-masculine to talking about cuddling with his mother.<ref name=\"run\" /> As a Patriot, he smoked large quantities of [[marijuana]] and used other drugs, including [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"run\" />\n\n===Brain damage===\nAfter his death, researchers at [[Boston University]] studied Hernandez's brain and diagnosed him with [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE), stage 3 of 4,<ref name=\"waste\" /><ref name=\"BU_CTE\" /><ref name=\"belson\" /> and described Hernandez's brain as a classic case of the pathology.<ref name=\"belson\" /><ref name=\"branch\" /><ref name=\"ever\" /> CTE is caused by repeated head trauma.<ref name=\"waste\" /> Hernandez had two confirmed concussions since he began playing football at eight years old, but the ''Boston Globe'' believes \"he undoubtedly took other punishing hits to the head that were never recorded.\"<ref name=\"waste\" /> CTE is associated with cumulative injuries. In a phone conversation recorded in prison, Hernandez said \"I'm like a grandpa. All my bones are so sore.\"<ref name=\"ki2\" />\n\nThe researchers suggested that the CTE, which results in poor judgment, lack of impulse control, or aggression, anger, paranoia, emotional volatility, and rage behaviors, may explain some of Hernandez's criminal acts and other behavior.<ref name=\"waste\" /><ref name=\"BU_CTE\" /> Sam Gandy of [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in New York said, \"It's impossible for me to look at the severity of CTE and Mr. Hernandez's brain and not think that that had a profound effect on his behavior.\"<ref name=\"waste\" /> Hernandez suffered from [[migraine]]s in prison, and had trouble with memory.<ref name=\"waste\" /> Jose Baez wrote that he saw symptoms consistent with CTE from his earliest meetings with Hernandez: Hernandez sometimes showed keen [[insight]] and observational skills, while other times he had gaps in memory that were highly unusual for a young person.<ref name=\"Baez2018\" />\n\nAfter release of the Boston University statement, Hernandez's fianc\u00e9e and daughter sued the Patriots and the NFL for causing Hernandez's death and depriving his daughter of her father's companionship, arguing that Hernandez's NFL career had caused what researchers described as \"the most severe case of [CTE] medically seen\" in a person at his age.<ref name=\"waste\" /><ref name=\"br\" /> The suit was dismissed in February 2019 because the deadline to opt out of a class action suit against the league had been missed.<ref name=\"dale\" />\n\n==In other media==\nHernandez's arrest, conviction, and death attracted a great deal of media attention, especially because of increasing concerns about CTE in athletes. His life was the focus of a 2018 ''[[Boston Globe]]'' Spotlight Team investigation and a podcast called \"Gladiator: Aaron Hernandez & Football, Inc.\"<ref name=\"netflix\" />\n\nA [[Netflix]]
