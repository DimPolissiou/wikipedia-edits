in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

Aerospace organizations research, design, manufacture, operate, or maintain [[aircraft]] or [[spacecraft]]. Aerospace activity is very diverse, with a multitude of commercial, industrial and military applications.\n\nAerospace is not the same as [[airspace]], which is the physical air space directly above a location on the ground. The beginning of space and the ending of the [[air]] is considered as 100&nbsp;km above the ground according to the physical explanation that the air pressure is too low for a lifting body to generate meaningful lift force without exceeding orbital velocity.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Where does space begin? - Aerospace Engineering, Aviation News, Salary, Jobs and Museums|url = http://aerospaceengineering.aero/where-does-space-begin/|website = Aerospace Engineering, Aviation News, Salary, Jobs and Museums|accessdate = 2015-11-10|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117034012/http://aerospaceengineering.aero/where-does-space-begin/|archivedate = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nIn most industrial countries, the aerospace industry is a cooperation of public and private industries. For example, several countries have a civilian [[space program]] funded by the [[government]] through tax collection, such as [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] in the United States, [[European Space Agency]] in Europe, the [[Canadian Space Agency]] in Canada, [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] in India, [[JAXA|Japanese Aeronautics Exploration Agency]] in Japan, [[myanmar]], [[Russian Federal Space Agency|RKA]] in Russia, [[China National Space Administration]] in China, [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission|SUPARCO]] in Pakistan, [[Iranian Space Agency]] in Iran, and [[Korea Aerospace Research Institute]] (KARI) in South Korea.\n\nAlong with these public space programs, many companies produce technical tools and components such as [[spacecraft|spaceship]]s and [[satellite]]s. Some known companies involved in space programs include [[Boeing]], [[Cobham plc|Cobham]], [[Airbus]], [[SpaceX]], [[Lockheed Martin]], [[United Technologies]], [[MacDonald Dettwiler]] and [[Northrop Grumman]]. These companies are also involved in other areas of aerospace such as the construction of aircraft.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of aviation|Timeline of space exploration}}\n\nModern aerospace began with Engineer [[George Cayley]] in 1799. Cayley proposed an aircraft with a \"fixed wing and a horizontal and vertical tail,\" defining characteristics of the modern airplane.<ref name=\"Intro to Flight\">{{cite book|last=Jr|first=John D. Anderson|title=Introduction to flight|year=2008|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-07-352939-4|edition=6th}}</ref>\n\nThe 19th century saw the creation of the [[Aeronautical Society of Great Britain]] (1866), the American Rocketry Society, and the [[Institute of Aeronautical Sciences]], all of which made aeronautics a more serious scientific discipline.<ref name=\"Intro to Flight\" /> Airmen like [[Otto Lilienthal]], who introduced [[Camber (aerodynamics)|cambered]] [[airfoil]]s in 1891, used gliders to analyze [[aerodynamic force]]s.<ref name=\"Intro to Flight\" /> The [[Wright brothers]] were interested in Lilienthal's work and read several of his publications.<ref name=\"Intro to Flight\" /> They also found inspiration in [[Octave Chanute]], an [[airman]] and the author of ''Progress in Flying Machines'' (1894).<ref name=\"Intro to Flight\" /> It was the preliminary work of Cayley, Lilienthal, Chanute, and other early aerospace engineers that brought about the first powered sustained flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina on December 17, 1903, by the Wright brothers.\n\nWar and science fiction inspired scientists and engineers like [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] and [[Wernher von Braun]] to achieve flight beyond the atmosphere. World War II inspired Wernher von Braun to create the V1 and V2 rockets.\n\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957 started the [[Space Age]], and on July 20, 1969 [[Apollo 11]] achieved the first manned moon landing.<ref name=\"Intro to Flight\" /> In April 1981, the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] launched, the start of regular manned access to orbital space. A sustained human presence in orbital space started with \"[[Mir]]\" in 1986 and is continued by the \"[[International Space Station]]\".<ref name=\"Intro to Flight\" /> [[Commercialization of space|Space commercialization]] and [[space tourism]] are more recent features of aerospace.\n\n==Manufacturing==\n{{Main|Aerospace manufacturer}}\nAerospace manufacturing is a high-technology industry that produces \"aircraft, guided missiles, space vehicles, aircraft engines, propulsion units, and related parts\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov|title=United States Bureau of Labor Statistics|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423042046/http://www.bls.gov/|archivedate=2013-04-23}}</ref> Most of the industry is geared toward governmental work.  For each [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM), the US government has assigned a [[Commercial and Government Entity code|Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code]]. These codes help to identify each manufacturer, repair facilities, and other critical aftermarket vendors in the aerospace industry.\n\nIn the United States, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) are the two largest consumers of aerospace technology and products. Others include the very large airline industry. The aerospace industry employed 472,000 wage and salary workers in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs006.htm|title=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Aerospace Product and Parts Manufacturing|accessdate=2009-07-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090814074317/http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs006.htm| archivedate= 14 August 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Most of those jobs were in Washington state and in California, with [[Missouri]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Texas]] also being important. The leading aerospace manufacturers in the U.S. are [[Boeing]], [[United Technologies Corporation]], [[SpaceX]], [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Lockheed Martin]]. These manufacturers are facing an increasing labor shortage as skilled U.S. workers age and retire. Apprenticeship programs such as the Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Council (AJAC) work in collaboration with Washington state aerospace employers and community colleges to train new manufacturing employees to keep the industry supplied.\n\nImportant locations of the civilian aerospace industry worldwide include [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state ([[Boeing]]), [[California]] ([[Boeing]], [[Lockheed Martin]], etc.); [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada ([[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], [[Pratt & Whitney Canada]]); [[Toulouse]], France ([[Airbus]]/[[EADS]]); [[Hamburg]], Germany ([[Airbus]]/[[EADS]]); and [[S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos]], Brazil ([[Embraer]]), [[Quer\u00e9taro]], Mexico (Bombardier Aerospace, General Electric Aviation) and [[Mexicali]], Mexico (United Technologies Corporation, [[Gulfstream Aerospace]]).\n\nIn the European Union, aerospace companies such as [[EADS]], [[BAE Systems]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], [[Dassault Group|Dassault]], [[Saab AB]] and [[Leonardo S.p.A.]] (formerly Finmeccnica)<ref>{{cite web|title=It's Official: Finmeccanica Is Now Leonardo|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/industry/2016/04/28/leonardo-finmeccanica/83671264/|website=Defensenews}}</ref> account for a large share of the global aerospace industry and research effort, with the [[European Space Agency]] as one of the largest consumers of aerospace technology and products.\n\nIn India, [[Bangalore]] is a major center of the aerospace industry, where [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]], the [[National Aerospace Laboratories]] and the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] are headquartered. The [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) launched India's first Moon orbiter, [[Chandrayaan-1]], in October 2008.\n\nIn Russia, large aerospace companies like [[Oboronprom]] and the [[United Aircraft Building Corporation]] (encompassing [[Mikoyan]], [[Sukhoi]], [[Ilyushin]], [[Tupolev]], [[Yakovlev]], and [[Irkut (company)|Irkut]] which includes [[Beriev]]) are among the major global players in this industry. The historic [[Soviet Union]] was also the home of a major aerospace industry.\n\nThe United Kingdom formerly attempted to maintain its own large aerospace industry, making its own [[airline]]rs and warplanes, but it has largely turned its lot over to cooperative efforts with continental companies, and it has turned into a large import customer, too, from countries such as the United States. However, the UK has a very active aerospace sector, including the second largest defence contractor in the world, [[BAE Systems]], supplying fully assembled aircraft, aircraft components, sub-assemblies and sub-systems to other manufacturers, both in Europe and all over the world.\n\nCanada has formerly manufactured some of its own designs for jet warplanes, etc. (e.g. the [[CF-100]] fighter), but for some decades, it has relied on imports from the United States and Europe to fill these needs. However Canada still manufactures some military aircraft although they are generally not combat capable. Another notable example was the late 1950s development of the [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]], a supersonic fighter-interceptor that was cancelled in 1959 a highly controversial decision.\n\nFrance has continued to make its own warplanes for its air force and navy, and Sweden continues to make its own warplanes for the Swedish Air Force&mdash;especially in support of its position as a [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] country. (See [[Saab AB]].) Other European countries either team up in making [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] (such as the [[Panavia Tornado]] and the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]]), or else to import them from the United States.\n\n[[Pakistan]] has a developing aerospace engineering industry. The [[National Engineering and Scientific Commission]], [[Khan Research Laboratories]] and [[Pakistan Aeronautical Complex]] are among the premier organizations involved in research and development in this sector. Pakistan has the capability of designing and manufacturing guided rockets, missiles and space vehicles. The city of [[Kamra]] is home to the [[Pakistan Aeronautical Complex]] which contains several factories. This facility is responsible for manufacturing the [[MFI-17 Mushshak|MFI-17]], [[MFI-395 Super Mushshak|MFI-395]], [[Hongdu JL-8|K-8]] and [[JF-17 Thunder]] aircraft. Pakistan also has the capability to design and manufacture both armed and unarmed [[unmanned aerial vehicles]].\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, Beijing, [[Xi'an]], [[Chengdu]], Shanghai, [[Shenyang]] and [[Nanchang]] are major research and manufacture centers of the aerospace industry. China has developed an extensive capability to design, test and produce military aircraft, missiles and space vehicles. Despite the cancellation in 1983 of the experimental [[Shanghai Y-10]], China is still developing its civil aerospace industry.\n\nThe [[aircraft parts industry]] was born out of the sale of second-hand or used aircraft parts from the aerospace manufacture sector.  Within the United States there is a specific process that parts brokers or resellers must follow.  This includes leveraging a certified repair station to [[aircraft maintenance|overhaul]] and \"tag\" a part.  This certification guarantees that a part was repaired or overhauled to meet OEM specifications.  Once a part is overhauled its value is determined from the supply and demand of the aerospace market.  When an airline has an [[aircraft on ground|aircraft on the ground]], the part that the airline requires to get the plane back into service becomes invaluable.  This can drive the market for specific parts.  There are several online marketplaces that assist with the commodity selling of aircraft parts.\n\nIn the aerospaces & defense industry, a lot of consolidation has appeared over the last couple of decades. Between 1988 and 2011, worldwide more than 6,068 [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers & acquisitions]] with a total known value of 678 bil.

It implies that the system or equipment can be operated properly and without causing any danger, risk, damage or injury.\n\nFunctional safety is crucial in the aerospace industry, which allows no compromises or negligence. In this respect, supervisory bodies, such as the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA\n),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easa.eu.int/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620150922/http://www.easa.eu.int/ |archivedate=2013-06-20 }} European Aviation Safety Agency</ref> regulate the aerospace market with strict certification standards. This is meant to reach and ensure the highest possible level of safety. The standards AS 9100 in America, EN 9100 on the European market or JISQ 9100 in Asia particularly address the aerospace and aviation industry. These are standards applying to the functional safety of aerospace vehicles. Some companies are therefore specialized in the certification, inspection verification and testing of the vehicles and spare parts to ensure and attest compliance with the appropriate regulations.\n\n==Spinoffs==\nSpinoffs refer to any technology that is a direct result of coding or products created by NASA and redesigned for an alternate purpose.<ref name=\"spinoff.nasa.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2015/pdf/Spinoff2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016211503/http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2015/pdf/Spinoff2015.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-16 }}</ref> These technological advancements are one of the primary results of the aerospace industry, with $5.2 billion worth of revenue generated by spinoff technology, including computers and cellular devices.<ref name=\"spinoff.nasa.gov\"/> These spinoffs have applications in a variety of different fields including medicine, transportation, energy, consumer goods, public safety and more.<ref name=\"spinoff.nasa.gov\"/> NASA publishes an annual report called \"Spinoffs\", regarding many of the specific products and benefits to the aforementioned areas in an effort to highlight some of the ways funding is put to use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/37079/benefits-of-space-exploration/|title=What Are The Benefits Of Space Exploration? - Universe Today|date=26 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321111726/http://www.universetoday.com/37079/benefits-of-space-exploration/|archivedate=21 March 2015}}</ref> For example, in the most recent edition of this publication, \"Spinoffs 2015\", endoscopes are featured as one of the medical derivations of aerospace achievement.<ref name=\"spinoff.nasa.gov\"/> This device enables more precise and subsequently cost-effective neurosurgery by reducing complications through a minimally invasive procedure that abbreviates hospitalization.<ref name=\"spinoff.nasa.gov\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Main|Outline of aerospace}}\n* [[Aerodynamics]]\n* [[Aeronautics]]\n* [[Aerospace engineering]]\n* [[Aircraft]]\n* [[Astronautics]]\n* [[NewSpace]]\n* [[List of space agencies|Space agencies]] (List of)\n* [[Space exploration]]\n* [[Spacecraft]]\n* [[wikt:Appendix:Aviation, aerospace, and aeronautical terms|Wiktionary: Aviation, aerospace, and aeronautical terms]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|aerospace}}\n\n[[Category:Aerospace| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Airspace}}\n{{For|the corporation|The Aerospace Corporation}}\n[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A view of the Earth's atmosphere with the Moon beyond]]\n'''Aerospace''' is the human effort in [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[business]] to fly in the [[atmosphere]] of Earth ([[aeronautics]]) and surrounding [[outer space|space]] ([[astronautics]]). Aerospace organizations research, design, manufacture, operate, or maintain [[aircraft]] or [[spacecraft]]. Aerospace activity is very diverse, with a multitude of commercial, industrial and military applications.\n\nAerospace is not the same as [[airspace]], which is the physical air space directly above a location on the ground. The beginning of space and the ending of the [[air]] is considered as 100&nbsp;km above the ground according to the physical explanation that the air pressure is too low for a lifting body to generate meaningful lift force without exceeding orbital velocity.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Where does space begin? - Aerospace Engineering, Aviation News, Salary, Jobs and Museums|url = http://aerospaceengineering.aero/where-does-space-begin/|website = Aerospace Engineering, Aviation News, Salary, Jobs and Museums|accessdate = 2015-11-10|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117034012/http://aerospaceengineering.aero/where-does-space-begin/|archivedate = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nIn most industrial countries, the aerospace industry is a cooperation of public and private industries. For example, several countries have a civilian [[space program]] funded by the [[government]] through tax collection, such as [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] in the United States, [[European Space Agency]] in Europe, the [[Canadian Space Agency]] in Canada, [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] in India, [[JAXA|Japanese Aeronautics Exploration Agency]] in Japan, [[myanmar]], [[Russian Federal Space Agency|RKA]] in Russia, [[China National Space Administration]] in China, [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission|SUPARCO]] in Pakistan, [[Iranian Space Agency]] in Iran, and [[Korea Aerospace Research Institute]] (KARI) in South Korea.\n\nAlong with these public space programs, many companies produce technical tools and components such as [[spacecraft|spaceship]]s and [[satellite]]s. Some known companies involved in space programs include [[Boeing]], [[Cobham plc|Cobham]], [[Airbus]], [[SpaceX]], [[Lockheed Martin]], [[United Technologies]], [[MacDonald Dettwiler]] and [[Northrop Grumman]]. These companies are also involved in other areas of aerospace such as the construction of aircraft.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of aviation|Timeline of space exploration}}\n\nModern aerospace began with Engineer [[George Cayley]] in 1799.

World War II inspired Wernher von Braun to create the V1 and V2 rockets.\n\nThe launch of Sputnik 1 in October 1957 started the [[Space Age]], and on July 20, 1969 [[Apollo 11]] achieved the first manned moon landing.<ref name=\"Intro to Flight\" /> In April 1981, the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] launched, the start of regular manned access to orbital space.

For each [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM), the US government has assigned a [[Commercial and Government Entity code|Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code]]. These codes help to identify each manufacturer, repair facilities, and other critical aftermarket vendors in the aerospace industry.\n\nIn the United States, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) are the two largest consumers of aerospace technology and products. Others include the very large airline industry. The aerospace industry employed 472,000 wage and salary workers in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs006.htm|title=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Aerospace Product and Parts Manufacturing|accessdate=2009-07-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090814074317/http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs006.htm| archivedate= 14 August 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Most of those jobs were in Washington state and in California, with [[Missouri]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Texas]] also being important. The leading aerospace manufacturers in the U.S. are [[Boeing]], [[United Technologies Corporation]], [[SpaceX]], [[Northrop Grumman]] and [[Lockheed Martin]]. These manufacturers are facing an increasing labor shortage as skilled U.S. workers age and retire. Apprenticeship programs such as the Aerospace Joint Apprenticeship Council (AJAC) work in collaboration with Washington state aerospace employers and community colleges to train new manufacturing employees to keep the industry supplied.\n\nImportant locations of the civilian aerospace industry worldwide include [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state ([[Boeing]]), [[California]] ([[Boeing]], [[Lockheed Martin]], etc.); [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada ([[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]], [[Pratt & Whitney Canada]]); [[Toulouse]], France ([[Airbus]]/[[EADS]]); [[Hamburg]], Germany ([[Airbus]]/[[EADS]]); and [[S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos]], Brazil ([[Embraer]]), [[Quer\u00e9taro]], Mexico (Bombardier Aerospace, General Electric Aviation) and [[Mexicali]], Mexico (United Technologies Corporation, [[Gulfstream Aerospace]]).\n\nIn the European Union, aerospace companies such as [[EADS]], [[BAE Systems]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], [[Dassault Group|Dassault]], [[Saab AB]] and [[Leonardo S.p.A.]] (formerly Finmeccnica)<ref>{{cite web|title=It's Official: Finmeccanica Is Now Leonardo|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/industry/2016/04/28/leonardo-finmeccanica/83671264/|website=Defensenews}}</ref> account for a large share of the global aerospace industry and research effort, with the [[European Space Agency]] as one of the largest consumers of aerospace technology and products.\n\nIn India, [[Bangalore]] is a major center of the aerospace industry, where [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]], the [[National Aerospace Laboratories]] and the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] are headquartered. The [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] (ISRO) launched India's first Moon orbiter, [[Chandrayaan-1]], in October 2008.\n\nIn Russia, large aerospace companies like [[Oboronprom]] and the [[United Aircraft Building Corporation]] (encompassing [[Mikoyan]], [[Sukhoi]], [[Ilyushin]], [[Tupolev]], [[Yakovlev]], and [[Irkut (company)|Irkut]] which includes [[Beriev]]) are among the major global players in this industry. The historic [[Soviet Union]] was also the home of a major aerospace industry.\n\nThe United Kingdom formerly attempted to maintain its own large aerospace industry, making its own [[airline]]rs and warplanes, but it has largely turned its lot over to cooperative efforts with continental companies, and it has turned into a large import customer, too, from countries such as the United States. However, the UK has a very active aerospace sector, including the second largest defence contractor in the world, [[BAE Systems]], supplying fully assembled aircraft, aircraft components, sub-assemblies and sub-systems to other manufacturers, both in Europe and all over the world.\n\nCanada has formerly manufactured some of its own designs for jet warplanes, etc. (e.g. the [[CF-100]] fighter), but for some decades, it has relied on imports from the United States and Europe to fill these needs. However Canada still manufactures some military aircraft although they are generally not combat capable. Another notable example was the late 1950s development of the [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]], a supersonic fighter-interceptor that was cancelled in 1959 a highly controversial decision.\n\nFrance has continued to make its own warplanes for its air force and navy, and Sweden continues to make its own warplanes for the Swedish Air Force&mdash;especially in support of its position as a [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] country. (See [[Saab AB]].) Other European countries either team up in making [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] (such as the [[Panavia Tornado]] and the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]]), or else to import them from the United States.\n\n[[Pakistan]] has a developing aerospace engineering industry. The [[National Engineering and Scientific Commission]], [[Khan Research Laboratories]] and [[Pakistan Aeronautical Complex]] are among the premier organizations involved in research and development in this sector. Pakistan has the capability of designing and manufacturing guided rockets, missiles and space vehicles. The city of [[Kamra]] is home to the [[Pakistan Aeronautical Complex]] which contains several factories. This facility is responsible for manufacturing the [[MFI-17 Mushshak|MFI-17]], [[MFI-395 Super Mushshak|MFI-395]], [[Hongdu JL-8|K-8]] and [[JF-17 Thunder]] aircraft. Pakistan also has the capability to design and manufacture both armed and unarmed [[unmanned aerial vehicles]].\n\nIn the People's Republic of China, Beijing, [[Xi'an]], [[Chengdu]], Shanghai, [[Shenyang]] and [[Nanchang]] are major research and manufacture centers of the aerospace industry. China has developed an extensive capability to design, test and produce military aircraft, missiles and space vehicles. Despite the cancellation in 1983 of the experimental [[Shanghai Y-10]], China is still developing its civil aerospace industry.\n\nThe [[aircraft parts industry]] was born out of the sale of second-hand or used aircraft parts from the aerospace manufacture sector.  Within the United States there is a specific process that parts brokers or resellers must follow.  This includes leveraging a certified repair station to [[aircraft maintenance|overhaul]] and \"tag\" a part.  This certification guarantees that a part was repaired or overhauled to meet OEM specifications.  Once a part is overhauled its value is determined from the supply and demand of the aerospace market.  When an airline has an [[aircraft on ground|aircraft on the ground]], the part that the airline requires to get the plane back into service becomes invaluable.  This can drive the market for specific parts.  There are several online marketplaces that assist with the commodity selling of aircraft parts.\n\nIn the aerospaces & defense industry, a lot of consolidation has appeared over the last couple of decades. Between 1988 and 2011, worldwide more than 6,068 [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers & acquisitions]] with a total known value of 678 bil.

It implies that the system or equipment can be operated properly and without causing any danger, risk, damage or injury.\n\nFunctional safety is crucial in the aerospace industry, which allows no compromises or negligence. In this respect, supervisory bodies, such as the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA\n),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easa.eu.int/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620150922/http://www.easa.eu.int/ |archivedate=2013-06-20 }} European Aviation Safety Agency</ref> regulate the aerospace market with strict certification standards. This is meant to reach and ensure the highest possible level of safety. The standards AS 9100 in America, EN 9100 on the European market or JISQ 9100 in Asia particularly address the aerospace and aviation industry. These are standards applying to the functional safety of aerospace vehicles. Some companies are therefore specialized in the certification, inspection verification and testing of the vehicles and spare parts to ensure and attest compliance with the appropriate regulations.\n\n==Spinoffs==\nSpinoffs refer to any technology that is a direct result of coding or products created by NASA and redesigned for an alternate purpose.<ref name=\"spinoff.nasa.gov\">{{cite web |url=http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2015/pdf/Spinoff2015.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016211503/http://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2015/pdf/Spinoff2015.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-16 }}</ref> These technological advancements are one of the primary results of the aerospace industry, with $5.2 billion worth of revenue generated by spinoff technology, including computers and cellular devices.<ref name=\"spinoff.nasa.gov\"/> These spinoffs have applications in a variety of different fields including medicine, transportation, energy, consumer goods, public safety and more.<ref name=\"spinoff.nasa.gov\"/> NASA publishes an annual report called \"Spinoffs\", regarding many of the specific products and benefits to the aforementioned areas in an effort to highlight some of the ways funding is put to use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/37079/benefits-of-space-exploration/|title=What Are The Benefits Of Space Exploration? - Universe Today|date=26 January 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321111726/http://www.universetoday.com/37079/benefits-of-space-exploration/|archivedate=21 March 2015}}</ref> For example, in the most recent edition of this publication, \"Spinoffs 2015\", endoscopes are featured as one of the medical derivations of aerospace achievement.<ref name=\"spinoff.nasa.gov\"/> This device enables more precise and subsequently cost-effective neurosurgery by reducing complications through a minimally invasive procedure that abbreviates hospitalization.<ref name=\"spinoff.nasa.gov\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Main|Outline of aerospace}}\n* [[Aerodynamics]]\n* [[Aeronautics]]\n* [[Aerospace engineering]]\n* [[Aircraft]]\n* [[Astronautics]]\n* [[NewSpace]]\n* [[List of space agencies|Space agencies]] (List of)\n* [[Space exploration]]\n* [[Spacecraft]]\n* [[wikt:Appendix:Aviation, aerospace, and aeronautical terms|Wiktionary: Aviation, aerospace, and aeronautical terms]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|aerospace}}\n\n[[Category:Aerospace| ]]\n", "name_user": "Thtatithticth", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eManufacturing:Make style consistent.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace"}

A [[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Private Act of Parliament]] allowed it to use public money to buy {{convert|226|acre}} of [[marsh]]y grazing land on the western edge of Birkenhead. Plots of land on the edge of the proposed park were then sold off in order to finance its construction.

Several miles of drainage pipes were laid to remove the water from the marshy land. During construction, hundreds of tonnes of stone and earth were moved to create well-drained terraces, hills, rockeries and lakes. It also led to the diversion of Old Bidston Road and the loss of a direct route between [[Claughton, Merseyside|Claughton]] and [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]].\nPaxton planted trees and shrubs at various places so visitors would enjoy the surprise of unexpected views or hidden features as they wandered through the park. Buildings included the Swiss Bridge, Boathouse, Norman Lodges, Gothic Lodge, Castellated Lodge and Italian Lodge. The [[Grand Entrance to Birkenhead Park|Grand Entrance]], which is one of several into the park, was built to look like a classical [[triumphal arch]]. \n[[File:Eisteddfod stone, Birkenhead Park (1).JPG|thumb|250px|[[National Eisteddfod of Wales|Eisteddfod stone]] within the Park.]]\nDuring the [[First World War]], part of the park was used as a training ground by the 3rd Battalion of the [[Cheshire Regiment]]. Recruits stayed at the Birkenhead Barracks on Grange Road West. [[Conscientious objectors]] were sent to the 3rd Cheshires because the battalion had a tough reputation. The family of a local trade unionist and \"conchie\", George Beardsworth, watched as he was repeatedly beaten and thrown over an obstacle course in the park.

Birkenhead park was influential on the design of public parks both in the UK and internationally and it is considered a landmark in the history of public parks.<ref name=\"historicengland.org.uk\"/>\n\nIn 1850, American landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] arrived by ship in [[Liverpool]]. During his stay in Northwest England, he paid a visit to Birkenhead Park along with several other public gardens. He noted Birkenhead was \"a model town\" which was built \"all in accordance with the advanced science, taste, and enterprising spirit that are supposed to distinguish the nineteenth century\".<ref>{{harvnb|Olmsted|1852|p=83}}</ref>\nIn 1858, he and [[Calvert Vaux]] won the competition to design a new park, [[Central Park]], for the rapidly growing city of [[New York City|New York]].\n \nOlmsted, who was influenced by the park, was greatly impressed by Paxton's designs. In his book ''Walks and Talks of an American Farmer in England'', he wrote about its social value as an aesthetic form:\n<blockquote>\nfive minutes of admiration, and a few more spent studying the manner in which art had been employed to obtain from nature so much beauty, and I was ready to admit that in democratic America there was nothing to be thought of as comparable with this People\u2019s Garden.<ref name=\"Olmsted-79\">{{harvnb|Olmsted|1852|p=79}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOlmsted also commented on the \"perfection\" of the park's gardening:\n<blockquote>\nI cannot undertake to describe the effect of so much taste and skill as had evidently been employed; I will only tell you, that we passed by winding paths, over acres and acres, with a constant varying surface, where on all sides were growing every variety of shrubs and flowers, with more than natural grace, all set in borders of greenest, closest turf, and all kept with consummate neatness.<ref name=\"Olmsted-79\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nBirkenhead Park was used as a template for the creation of [[Sefton Park]], which opened in Liverpool in 1872.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Points of interest==\n[[File:Birkenhead Park cricket pavilion 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The gabled cricket pavilion]]\n[[File:Jackson monument, Birkenhead Park front.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Jackson Memorial drinking fountain]]\nThe [[Grand Entrance to Birkenhead Park|Grand Entrance]] is at the northeast entrance to Birkenhead Park.

The [[Grand Entrance to Birkenhead Park|Grand Entrance]] was designed by [[Lewis Hornblower]] and is at the northeast corner; it consists of three arches flanked by lodges and is in [[Ionic order|Ionic]] style. The Swiss Bridge, a pedestrian span of stringer construction, is unique as being the only [[covered bridge]] of traditional wooden construction in the United Kingdom. There is also a [[Pavilion]] called the Roman Boathouse standing by the lake in the park, the upper storey of which was originally intended to be a bandstand. There are a large number of historic listed lodges of various designs within the grounds of the park.\n\nThe park has a modern visitor centre, caf\u00e9, children's play area, woodland walks and various sporting facilities and clubs.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roman pavilion, Birkenhead Park 2019-1.jpg|thumb|250px|Roman Pavilion and Boathouse]]\n[[File:Swiss Bridge, Birkenhead Park 2019-1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Swiss Bridge over the lake.]]\nIn 1841 an [[Improvement commissioners|Improvement Commission]] within Birkenhead's local government proposed the idea of a municipal park. A [[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Private Act of Parliament]] allowed it to use public money to buy {{convert|226|acre}} of [[marsh]]y grazing land on the western edge of Birkenhead. Plots of land on the edge of the proposed park were then sold off in order to finance its construction. The park plan was designed by [[Joseph Paxton]] and the building was supervised by [[Edward Kemp (landscape architect)|Edward Kemp]] because both had previously worked on redesigning the gardens at [[Chatsworth House]].<ref name=\"trees\"/> Entrances, gateways, lodges, and other structures were designed for the park by [[Lewis Hornblower]] and John Robertson.{{sfnp|Hartwell|Hyde|Hubbard|Pevsner|2011|pp=144\u2013146|ps=}}  Meanwhile, high-class residential accommodation was being built both around the park and in other areas, such as Clifton Park, the layout and buildings designed by Walter Scott and [[Charles Reed (architect)|Charles Reed]].{{sfnp|Hartwell|Hyde|Hubbard|Pevsner|2011|pp=159\u2013151|ps=}}  Although some large houses and private villas were initially built by local merchants and wealthier business people, the [[Long Depression]] in the latter 19th century meant many plots remained undeveloped well into early 20th century.<ref name=\"trees\">{{cite book|title=Trees in Towns and Cities: A History of British Urban Arboriculture|first=Mark|last= Johnston|publisher=Windgather Press|year= 2015|ISBN= 9781909686656|page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tgJDCwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA154&dq=economic%20long%20depression%20birkenhead%20park&pg=PA154#v=onepage&q=economic%20conditions&f=false 154]}}</ref>\n\nThe park took five years to build and was officially opened on 5 April 1847<ref name=\"historicengland.org.uk\">{{Cite web |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1000994 |title=BIRKENHEAD PARK, Non Civil Parish - 1000994 |website=Historic England |access-date=2020-04-02 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> by [[Lord Morpeth]], an estimated 10,000 people attended on that day.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolparks.org/red/docs/parks/birkenhead_park/index.html |title=Birkenhead Park |website=Liverpool Parks |access-date=2020-04-02 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The park had an informal style rather than a structured neatly arranged urban garden. Several miles of drainage pipes were laid to remove the water from the marshy land. During construction, hundreds of tonnes of stone and earth were moved to create well-drained terraces, hills, rockeries and lakes. It also led to the diversion of Old Bidston Road and the loss of a direct route between [[Claughton, Merseyside|Claughton]] and [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]].\nPaxton planted trees and shrubs at various places so visitors would enjoy the surprise of unexpected views or hidden features as they wandered through the park. Buildings included the Swiss Bridge, Boathouse, Norman Lodges, Gothic Lodge, Castellated Lodge and Italian Lodge. The [[Grand Entrance to Birkenhead Park|Grand Entrance]], which is one of several into the park, was built to look like a classical [[triumphal arch]]. \n[[File:Eisteddfod stone, Birkenhead Park (1).JPG|thumb|250px|[[National Eisteddfod of Wales|Eisteddfod stone]] within the Park.]]\nDuring the [[First World War]], part of the park was used as a training ground by the 3rd Battalion of the [[Cheshire Regiment]]. Recruits stayed at the Birkenhead Barracks on Grange Road West. [[Conscientious objectors]] were sent to the 3rd Cheshires because the battalion had a tough reputation. The family of a local trade unionist and \"conchie\", George Beardsworth, watched as he was repeatedly beaten and thrown over an obstacle course in the park.

Prior to Birkenhead all parks had been created by private individuals or private organisations and access was held privately, although it could be given to the public. Birkenhead park was influential on the design of public parks both in the UK and internationally and it is considered a landmark in the history of public parks.<ref name=\"historicengland.org.uk\"/>\n\nIn 1850, American landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] arrived by ship in [[Liverpool]]. During his stay in Northwest England, he paid a visit to Birkenhead Park along with several other public gardens. He noted Birkenhead was \"a model town\" which was built \"all in accordance with the advanced science, taste, and enterprising spirit that are supposed to distinguish the nineteenth century\".<ref>{{harvnb|Olmsted|1852|p=83}}</ref>\nIn 1858, he and [[Calvert Vaux]] won the competition to design a new park, [[Central Park]], for the rapidly growing city of [[New York City|New York]].\n \nOlmsted, who was influenced by the park, was greatly impressed by Paxton's designs. In his book ''Walks and Talks of an American Farmer in England'', he wrote about its social value as an aesthetic form:\n<blockquote>\nfive minutes of admiration, and a few more spent studying the manner in which art had been employed to obtain from nature so much beauty, and I was ready to admit that in democratic America there was nothing to be thought of as comparable with this People\u2019s Garden.<ref name=\"Olmsted-79\">{{harvnb|Olmsted|1852|p=79}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOlmsted also commented on the \"perfection\" of the park's gardening:\n<blockquote>\nI cannot undertake to describe the effect of so much taste and skill as had evidently been employed; I will only tell you, that we passed by winding paths, over acres and acres, with a constant varying surface, where on all sides were growing every variety of shrubs and flowers, with more than natural grace, all set in borders of greenest, closest turf, and all kept with consummate neatness.<ref name=\"Olmsted-79\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nBirkenhead Park was used as a template for the creation of [[Sefton Park]], which opened in Liverpool in 1872.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Points of interest==\n[[File:Birkenhead Park cricket pavilion 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The gabled cricket pavilion]]\n[[File:Jackson monument, Birkenhead Park front.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Jackson Memorial drinking fountain]]\nThe [[Grand Entrance to Birkenhead Park|Grand Entrance]] is at the northeast entrance to Birkenhead Park.

{"title_page": "Discernment of Spirits", "text_new": "'''Discernment of Spirits''' is a term used in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]] and Charismatic (Evangelist) Christian [[theology]] to indicate judging various spiritual agents for their moral influence.  These agents are:\n# from within the human soul itself, known as [[concupiscence]]\n# [[Divine Grace]]\n# [[Angel]]s\n# [[Devil]]s\nThe first and the last being evil, and the second and third good, the judgment required is to discern the cause of a given impulse.  Although some people are regarded as having a special gift to perceive this by intuitive light, most people are regarded as needing study and reflection, and possibly the direction of others.\n\nThis judgment can be made in two ways. The first is by a ''[[charism]]'' or [[spiritual gift]] divinely granted to certain individuals for the discerning of spirits by [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] ([[1 Corinthians]] 12:10). The second way to discern spirits is by reflection and theological study. This second method then is an acquired human knowledge; however, it is always gained \"with the assistance of grace, by the reading of the Holy Bible, of works on theology and asceticism, of autobiographies, and the correspondence of the most distinguished ascetics\".<ref name=\"cathen\">{{Catholic|last= Debuchy | first = Paul |title = Discernment of Spirits | encyclopedia = The Catholic Encyclopedia | volume = 5 | publisher = Robert Appleton Company | year = 1909 | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05028b.htm | accessdate = 18 June 2011 |inline =1}}</ref>\n\n==Orthodox views==\nApostle Paul mentions the gift of discerning of spirits in 1 Cor. 12:10. St. [[John Chrysostom]] in the interpretation of this passage says that these words mean the ability to tell who is spiritual and who is not, who is prophet and who is not since at the time of Apostle Paul, there were false prophets deluding people.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[http://bible.optina.ru/new:1kor:12:08 Interpretation of 1 Cor. 12:8]</ref> St. [[Ephrem the Syrian]] in the interpretation of the same words says that the gift of discerning of spirits is good management of the church.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[http://bible.optina.ru/new:1kor:12:10 Interpretation of 1 Cor. 12:10]</ref>\n\nIn everyday life, the most often needed kind of discernment of spirits is discernment of thoughts (if the person analyzes his thoughts at all). Besides thoughts, discernment of spirits can be applied to the judgment of such phenomena as night dreams, visions, miracles, prophecies, and other supernatural gifts.\n\nIn an ideal case, the main tool of discernment could be the person's conscience. But in reality, that relates only to the people of holy life. St. Hilarion of Optina writes: \"To the question of yours, whether your conscience can accurately show you your errors, I will answer this way - you should not trust your conscience much, because it has not yet been cleansed as it should\".<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[https://www.optina.ru/starets/ilarion_letters_4/#48 Letters of St. Hilarion of Optina. Letter 48.]</ref> Because of this perversion of the conscience, basic discernment of good and evil is helped through reading of the Bible and its interpretation from the Holy Fathers. Further discernment is described in such books as: [[Philokalia]] (a collection of writings of Holy Fathers), [[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]] by St. John Climacus, and \"Letters\" by Sts. Barsanuphius and John the Prophet. [[Theophan the Recluse]] writes: \"whoever wants to know more precisely what the discernment of thoughts is, let him read the book of answers of Barsanuphius and John, the clairvoyant recluses. Concerning every deed, the thoughts can double and triple - what should be done? If a passionate thought appeared as it is in comparison with a passionless one, then it would be easy to determine; but usually with someone who has begun to pay attention to himself, passionate thoughts are not in their form, but always under specious cover. Therefore, there is always a danger of acting as if for good, and yet it will be out of passion. In the mentioned book all sorts of cases are discussed by the enlightened mind of the clairvoyant elders; it presents a detailed science of how to guess the fate of God's truth in this regard\".<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[https://lib.pravmir.ru/library/readbook/2925 Selected Psalms Interpreted by St. Theophan the Recluse.]</ref> In another place: \"read [the writings of] [[Macarius of Egypt|Macarius the Great]] and especially the [[The Ladder of Divine Ascent|Ladder]] where it is said a lot about discernment of thoughts.\"<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.xpa-spb.ru/libr/Feofan-Zatvornik/sobranie-pisem-4-705.html Letters of St. Theophan the Recluse. Letter 705.]</ref>\n\nAccording to [[John of Damascus]], the virtue of discernment (discrimination) \"is greater than any other virtue; and is the queen and crown of all the virtues\".<ref>Philokalia, Vol.2, St. John of Damaskos, On the Virtues and the Vices.</ref>\n\nThe key to discernment is humility, as well as its two manifestations: consulting with others and praying about everything we want to do: \"Discrimination is born of humility. On its possessor it confers spiritual insight, as both Moses and St [[John Climacus]] say: such a man foresees the hidden designs of the enemy and foils them before they are put into operation. It is as David states: \u2018And my eyes looked down upon my enemies\u2019 (Ps. 14:7. LXX).<...> If you have not received this gift you should not think, say or do anything without consulting others about it, and without a basis of firm faith and pure prayer. Without such faith and such prayer you will never truly achieve discrimination\".<ref>Philokalia, Vol.3, St. Peter of Damaskos, Book 1. A Treasury of Divine Knowledge, True Discrimination.</ref>\n\n[[John Cassian]] writes in \"Conferences\" that discernment \"is only secured by true humility. And of this humility the first proof is given by reserving everything (not only what you do but also what you think), for the scrutiny of the elders, so as not to trust at all in your own judgment but to acquiesce in their decisions in all points, and to acknowledge what ought to be considered good or bad by their traditions\".<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/NPNF2-11/Npnf2-11-50.htm St. John Cassian, \"Conferences\". The Second Conference of Abbot Moses. On Discretion, Chapter X. The answer how true discretion may be gained.]</ref>\nAlso it is important that \"all extremes are equally harmful\".<ref>Philokalia, Vol.1, St. John Cassian, On the Holy Fathers of Sketis And on Discrimination. Written for Abba Leontios.</ref>\n\nThe Bible confirms the importance of counsel: \"Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders, and they will explain to you\" (Deut 32:7); \"Where there is strife, there is pride, but wisdom is found in those who take advice\" (Prov 13:10); \"Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed\" (Prov 15:22); \"Plans are established by seeking advice; so if you wage war, obtain guidance\" (Prov 20:18); \"Surely you need guidance to wage war, and victory is won through many advisers\" (Prov 24:6); \"Gold and silver provide security, but good advice is better\" (Sir 40:25); \"If you find someone with understanding, get up early to call on him; wear out his doorstep with your visits\" (Sir 6:36).\n\nJohn Climacus devoted large chapter of his book to discernment, namely Step 26. In particular, he writes that \"those who wish to learn the will of the Lord must first mortify their own will. Then, having prayed to God with faith and honest simplicity, and having asked the fathers or even the brothers with humility of heart and no thought of doubt, they should accept their advice as from the mouth of God, even if their advice be contrary to their own view, and even if those consulted are not very spiritual. For God is not unjust, and will not lead astray souls who with faith and innocence humbly submit to the advice and judgment of their neighbour. Even if those who were asked were brute beasts, yet He who speaks is the Immaterial and Invisible One. Those who allow themselves to be guided by this rule without having any doubts are filled with great humility. For if someone expounded his problems on a harp,(Cf. Psalm 48, 4) how much better, do you think, can a rational mind and reasonable soul teach than an inanimate object\"; \"some of those who were seeking the will of God laid aside all attachments; they submitted to the Lord their own thought about this or that inclination of the soul, I mean whether to perform an action or to resist it; they submitted their mind stripped of its own will to Him, offering fervent prayer for a set number of days. In this way they attained to a knowledge of His will, either through the spiritual Mind spiritually communicating with their mind or through the complete disappearance from their soul of their cherished intention. Others  on  account  of  the  trouble  and  distractions  which  attended  their  undertaking  concluded that these disturbances came from God, according to him who said: We wanted to come to you time and again but Satan hindered us. (Thess 2.18) Others,  on  the  contrary,  recognized  that  their  action  was  pleasing  to  God  from  its  unexpected success, declaring: God co-operates with everyone who deliberately chooses to do good. He who has obtained God within him through illumination, both in actions requiring haste and in actions allowing of delay, is assured of His will by the second way, only without a definite period of time\". Athanasius of Crete comments on the last phrase that when discerning God's will, the ones who have God in them do not look at the obstacles but look at the God's help in the matter. Also, \"in all our actions, the intention must be sought from the Lord, whether in those that require haste or in those that require to be postponed. For all actions free from attachment and from all impurity will be imputed to us for good if they have been done especially for the Lord\u2019s sake and not for anyone else, even though these deeds are not entirely good\".<ref>St. John Climacus. The Ladder of Divine Ascent. Step 26.

That is, the very topic is for the ones with high measures. Otherwise, there is a danger of being ridiculed and deceived by the demons. Only after such preface, St. Barsanuphius writes: \"do nothing without counsel\"(Cf. Sir 32.19) even if it appears to be good to you; for the light of the demons is later revealed as darkness. If, then, you hear or think or see something, with the slightest turmoil in your heart, then learn that this comes from the demons\". In other words (in Letter 21), \"every thought that does not previously possess the calmness of humility is not according to God but is clearly a form of righteousness coming from the left hand. For our Lord comes with calmness, whereas all that comes from the adversary occurs with turmoil and the commotion of wrath; indeed, if they seem to put on \u201csheep\u2019s clothing,\u201d you should know that \u201cinwardly, they are ravenous wolves.\u201d (Mt 7.15) So they are manifested by their turmoil. For it is said: \u201cYou shall know them by their fruits.\u201d (Mt 7.16)\". When there is nobody to ask, St. Barsanuphius advises to pray 3 times (for 3 days in a row or, in case of emergency, 3 times in one day (Cf. Mt 26.44)) about every deed we want to know about whether it is from God or from the demons, and observe where the heart inclines, even to the slightest degree.<ref>[http://oprelesti.ru/index.php/what-is-spiritual-delusion/671-about-discernment-of-thoughts Sts.

Barsanuphius the Great.]</ref> That is, discernment without counsel is allowed by St. Barsanuphius when absolutely necessary because hermits visit people rarely. In another place (Letter 265 of abba Dorotheos) St. Barsanuphius writes that he prays that God granted abba Dorotheos the gift of discernment, but without heart labor no one gets it (in the Russian translation, it is translated as \"pain\" or \"trouble\" instead of \"labor\").\n\n===Divine and demonic help===\nWhen someone prays to God, his prayer is executed and he receives \"help\", but at this moment, he feels pride, that is a sign of demonic origin of this \"help\". St. Barsanuphius says: \"when you have been praying and feel that your prayer has been heard, if indeed you are elated, it is clear that yon have neither prayed according to God nor have you received the help of God, but rather the feeling that worked in you was from the demons so that your heart might be elated. For whenever assistance comes from God, the soul is never elated; instead, it is always humbled. The soul will be amazed at how the great mercy of God condescends to show mercy on sinners, who are unworthy and who always irritate him. And that soul offers exceeding thanks to his glorious and ineffable goodness; for he has not handed us what accords with our sins, but rather, in his great forbearance, he shows long-suffering and mercy. And so the soul is no longer elated, but [only trembles] and gives glory.\"<ref>Sts. Barsanuphius and John the Prophet. Letters. Letter 421.</ref>\n\n===Discernment of night dreams===\nSimilar to discernment of thoughts, confusion and turmoil after a night dream is the sign of its demonic origin. St. Theophan the Recluse writes in a letter: \"your night dream should not be trusted already because it confused you.\"<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[https://www.optina.ru/lec_mac/42/#128 Letters of Macarius of Optina. Prelest.]</ref> Elder Joseph the Hesychast also writes in a letter about disturbance after demonic dreams: \"however, one must be cautious and discerning here, too, my child, and must not believe in dreams, but must recognize whether they are from God or from the demons. But since not everyone has this discernment, one should not believe in them at all. However, dreams from God can be recognized. Sometimes one sees them in deep sleep, other times in a light sleep, as if sleeping but not really sleeping and for a short duration. And when he wakes up, he is full of joy, and his mind meditates on them, and they bring him theoria. For years and years he brings them to mind, and they are unforgettable. On the contrary, dreams from the demons fill the soul with disturbance. When one wakes up and the mind tries to recall them, he is filled with fear, and his heart does not accept them. But even during sleep as he sees them, they are not stationary, but they change into forms and shapes, into places and ways, into actions and movements. From these changes and the disturbance and the unpleasantness, you are able to recognize where they are from. There are also other things proceeding from the imagination and from overeating, but it is not necessary to point them out.\"<ref>Elder Joseph the Hesychast. Monastic Wisdom. Epistle to Hesychast Hermit. Ch. 5.</ref> \n\nSt. Ambrose of Optina also says that it is better not to believe night dreams at all: if one will believe dreams, he can go completely mad.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[https://www.optina.ru/starets/amvrosiy_letters_chart2_42/#424 Letters of St. Ambrose of Optina.

[[Evagrius Ponticus|Evagrius]] writes: \"it is impossible to receive knowledge without having made the first, second, and third renunciation[s]. The first renunciation is to voluntarily leave all worldly things for the knowledge of God; the second is the casting aside of evil which occurs through the grace of Christ our Savior and the zeal of the human person; the third renunciation is separation from ignorance concerning those things that are naturally manifested to people in accordance with their state.\" <ref>[http://www.ldysinger.com/Evagrius/04_Peri-Log/00a_start.htm Evagrius. On thoughts. Ch 26.]</ref> Other Fathers specify the renunciations differently, but this is not a contradiction but a supplement. St. John Cassian writes: \"The first is that by which as far as the body is concerned we make light of all the wealth and goods of this world; the second, that by which we reject the fashions and vices and former affections of soul and flesh; the third, that by which we detach our soul from all present and visible things, and contemplate only things to come, and set our heart on what is invisible.\" <ref>[https://st-takla.org/books/en/ecf/211/2110624.html St. John Cassian.

The Ladder of Divine Ascent. Step 2. 9.</ref>\n\n===Cases of right and wrong discernment===\nWhen something demonic is accepted as Divine, i.e. when there is an error in discernment of spirits, this may result in [[Prelest|spiritual delusion]] because the latter by the definition of St. Ignatius (Brianchaninov) is \"man\u2019s assimilation of falsehood which he accepts as truth\". The degree of delusion is the degree of such assimilation. There are many stories in the lives of the saints when people were deceived by false visions of the demons in the form of Lord Jesus and Angels (2 Cor 11:14). For example, [[Nicetas of Novgorod]]. In the early life, he was deluded by an \"angel\" as if being sent to help him after he recklessly attempted the feat of seclusion.<ref>[https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2011/01/saint-nikitas-of-kiev-caves-and-bishop.html Living of St. Nikitas of the Kiev Caves.]</ref> \n\nSt. [[Symeon the Stylite]] was deluded by demons who showed him a chariot wanting to take him to Heaven as it was with Prophet Elias. The chariot disappeared when St. Symeon wanted to enter it but made the sign of the Cross.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[http://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%96%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D1%81%D0%B2%D1%8F%D1%82%D1%8B%D1%85_%28%D0%94%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%29/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8F%D0%B1%D1%80%D1%8C/1 Living of Saint Symeon the Stylite]</ref>\n\nWhen St. Pachomius the Great was living in solitude, the Devil appeared in front of him as \"Christ\" and said: \"Greetings, Pachomius, I am Christ paying you a visit, my faithful friend.\" But St. Pachomius was in turmoil and had confusing thoughts. So he understood the delusion and rejected the vision: \"Devil, depart from me, cursed are you and your visions and your insidious arts. You have no place among the servants of God.\"<ref>[http://www.vitae-patrum.org.uk/page16.html Life of St. Pachomius. Chapter XLVIII.]</ref>\n\nMore cases are described in the article about [[Prelest]].\n\n==Ignatian view (Roman Catholic)==\n\nFor [[St. Ignatius of Loyola|Ignatius of Loyola]], there are two signs to judge:  evil spirits act on the imagination and the senses, and the good spirit, upon reason and conscience.  Then, they can be judged by their mode of action and by the end they seek.<ref name=\"cathen\"/> The discernment of spirits is part of everyone's spiritual journey.  No one who is trying to make spiritual progress should attempt to do so alone - a [[spiritual director]] is required.  A director assists a Christian in examining the motives, desires, [[consolation]]s, and [[suffering|desolation]]s in one's life.  Objectively, one can know what is right from looking at the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] in a thorough [[examination of conscience]].  But the broader picture of one's life is often not so clear.  A Christian should, according to St. Ignatius, share everything with a director who can see things objectively, without being swayed by the emotions or passion.  Discerning whether the good spirit (the influence of God, the Church, one's soul) or the bad spirit (the influence of Satan, the world, the flesh) is at work requires calm, rational reflection.  The good spirit brings us to peaceful, joyful decisions.  The bad spirit often brings us to make quick, emotional, conflicted decisions.  A spiritual director can assist both by personal experience, listening with care, and giving an objective analysis. Ignatius lays out his 23 rules for the discernment of spirits in his [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|''Spiritual Exercises'']] manual for those who direct others through [[Retreat (spiritual)#Roman Catholicism|retreats]].\n\n==Pentecostal and charismatic view==\n\nDiscernment of spirits is particularly important among [[Pentecostal]] and [[charismatic movement|charismatic]] Christians because of their emphasis on the operation of all the spiritual gifts within their churches. It becomes necessary then to be able to determine whether the exercise of a spiritual gift (such as [[prophecy]] or an [[interpretation of tongues]]) comes from the Holy Spirit, an evil spirit, or merely the human spirit.<ref name=foundations338>Guy P. Duffield and Nathaniel M. Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', 1983, (Los Angeles: Foursquare Media, 2008), p. 340-341.</ref> They believe that every Christian is able to judge and responsible for judging whether such an occurrence is helpful and edifying to the church; however, they also believe that there are those individuals who have been given the spiritual gift of discerning of spirits by the power of the Holy Spirit. It is important to note that the discerning of spirits does not involve the judging of people. The gift of discerning of spirits is also believed to be necessary in distinguishing [[demonic possession]] from mental or physical illness.<ref name=foundations497-501>Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', 497-501.</ref> This is important in the actual practice of deliverance, otherwise known as exorcism or the casting out of demons, which was part of the great commission that Jesus gave his disciples and future generations of believers. According to the late Albert Taylor, in \"Ministering Below the Surface \u2013 a practical guide to Inner Healing and Deliverance\", discerning of spirits can also be learnt. \n\nAdditionally, many Charismatics and those in Pentecostal churches believe that the gift of discernment of Spirits allows certain individuals to see spirits. The story about Elisha and the host of angels (cf. 2 Kings 6:15-17) is given as an example along with many other modern examples in the Book 'School of the Seers' by Dr. Jonathan Welton.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jonathan |last=Welton|title=The School of the Seers: A Practical Guide on How to See in the Unseen Realm|location= [[Shippensburg, Pennsylvania]]|publisher= Destiny Image Publishers|year= 2009}}</ref>\n\nDiscernment is the ability to make wise decisions in difficult situations.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Psychometry (paranormal)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05028b.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' \"Discernment of Spirits\"]\n*[http://www.didymus.org/rules-for-the-discerning-of-spirits.html Rules for the Discerning of Spirits: A Brief Summary of the Church's Traditional Teaching ]\n\n{{Private revelation}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Catholic theology and doctrine]]\n[[Category:Catholic spirituality]]\n[[Category:Spiritual gifts]]\n", "text_old": "'''Discernment of Spirits''' is a term used in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic]] and Charismatic (Evangelist) Christian [[theology]] to indicate judging various spiritual agents for their moral influence.  These agents are:\n# from within the human soul itself, known as [[concupiscence]]\n# [[Divine Grace]]\n# [[Angel]]s\n# [[Devil]]s\nThe first and the last being evil, and the second and third good, the judgment required is to discern the cause of a given impulse.  Although some people are regarded as having a special gift to perceive this by intuitive light, most people are regarded as needing study and reflection, and possibly the direction of others.\n\nThis judgment can be made in two ways. The first is by a ''[[charism]]'' or [[spiritual gift]] divinely granted to certain individuals for the discerning of spirits by [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] ([[1 Corinthians]] 12:10). The second way to discern spirits is by reflection and theological study. This second method then is an acquired human knowledge; however, it is always gained \"with the assistance of grace, by the reading of the Holy Bible, of works on theology and asceticism, of autobiographies, and the correspondence of the most distinguished ascetics\".<ref name=\"cathen\">{{Catholic|last= Debuchy | first = Paul |title = Discernment of Spirits | encyclopedia = The Catholic Encyclopedia | volume = 5 | publisher = Robert Appleton Company | year = 1909 | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05028b.htm | accessdate = 18 June 2011 |inline =1}}</ref>\n\n==Orthodox views==\nApostle Paul mentions the gift of discerning of spirits in 1 Cor. 12:10. St. [[John Chrysostom]] in the interpretation of this passage says that these words mean the ability to tell who is spiritual and who is not, who is prophet and who is not since at the time of Apostle Paul, there were false prophets deluding people.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[http://bible.optina.ru/new:1kor:12:08 Interpretation of 1 Cor. 12:8]</ref> St. [[Ephrem the Syrian]] in the interpretation of the same words says that the gift of discerning of spirits is good management of the church.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[http://bible.optina.ru/new:1kor:12:10 Interpretation of 1 Cor. 12:10]</ref>\n\nIn everyday life, the most often needed kind of discernment of spirits is discernment of thoughts (if the person analyzes his thoughts at all). Besides thoughts, discernment of spirits can be applied to the judgment of such phenomena as night dreams, visions, miracles, prophecies, and other supernatural gifts.\n\nIn an ideal case, the main tool of discernment could be the person's conscience. But in reality, that relates only to the people of holy life. St. Hilarion of Optina writes: \"To the question of yours, whether your conscience can accurately show you your errors, I will answer this way - you should not trust your conscience much, because it has not yet been cleansed as it should\".<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[https://www.optina.ru/starets/ilarion_letters_4/#48 Letters of St. Hilarion of Optina. Letter 48.]</ref> Because of this perversion of the conscience, basic discernment of good and evil is helped through reading of the Bible and its interpretation from the Holy Fathers. Further discernment is described in such books as: [[Philokalia]] (a collection of writings of Holy Fathers), [[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]] by St. John Climacus, and \"Letters\" by Sts. Barsanuphius and John the Prophet. [[Theophan the Recluse]] writes: \"whoever wants to know more precisely what the discernment of thoughts is, let him read the book of answers of Barsanuphius and John, the clairvoyant recluses. Concerning every deed, the thoughts can double and triple - what should be done? If a passionate thought appeared as it is in comparison with a passionless one, then it would be easy to determine; but usually with someone who has begun to pay attention to himself, passionate thoughts are not in their form, but always under specious cover. Therefore, there is always a danger of acting as if for good, and yet it will be out of passion. In the mentioned book all sorts of cases are discussed by the enlightened mind of the clairvoyant elders; it presents a detailed science of how to guess the fate of God's truth in this regard\".<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[https://lib.pravmir.ru/library/readbook/2925 Selected Psalms Interpreted by St. Theophan the Recluse.]</ref> In another place: \"read [the writings of] [[Macarius of Egypt|Macarius the Great]] and especially the [[The Ladder of Divine Ascent|Ladder]] where it is said a lot about discernment of thoughts.\"<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.xpa-spb.ru/libr/Feofan-Zatvornik/sobranie-pisem-4-705.html Letters of St. Theophan the Recluse. Letter 705.]</ref>\n\nAccording to [[John of Damascus]], the virtue of discernment (discrimination) \"is greater than any other virtue; and is the queen and crown of all the virtues\".<ref>Philokalia, Vol.2, St. John of Damaskos, On the Virtues and the Vices.</ref>\n\nThe key to discernment is humility, as well as its two manifestations: consulting with others and praying about everything we want to do: \"Discrimination is born of humility. On its possessor it confers spiritual insight, as both Moses and St [[John Climacus]] say: such a man foresees the hidden designs of the enemy and foils them before they are put into operation. It is as David states: \u2018And my eyes looked down upon my enemies\u2019 (Ps. 14:7. LXX).<...> If you have not received this gift you should not think, say or do anything without consulting others about it, and without a basis of firm faith and pure prayer. Without such faith and such prayer you will never truly achieve discrimination\".<ref>Philokalia, Vol.3, St. Peter of Damaskos, Book 1. A Treasury of Divine Knowledge, True Discrimination.</ref>\n\n[[John Cassian]] writes in \"Conferences\" that discernment \"is only secured by true humility. And of this humility the first proof is given by reserving everything (not only what you do but also what you think), for the scrutiny of the elders, so as not to trust at all in your own judgment but to acquiesce in their decisions in all points, and to acknowledge what ought to be considered good or bad by their traditions\".<ref>[http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/NPNF2-11/Npnf2-11-50.htm St. John Cassian, \"Conferences\".

Written for Abba Leontios.</ref>\n\nThe Bible confirms the importance of counsel: \"Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders, and they will explain to you\" (Deut 32:7); \"Where there is strife, there is pride, but wisdom is found in those who take advice\" (Prov 13:10); \"Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed\" (Prov 15:22); \"Plans are established by seeking advice; so if you wage war, obtain guidance\" (Prov 20:18); \"Surely you need guidance to wage war, and victory is won through many advisers\" (Prov 24:6); \"Gold and silver provide security, but good advice is better\" (Sir 40:25); \"If you find someone with understanding, get up early to call on him; wear out his doorstep with your visits\" (Sir 6:36).\n\nJohn Climacus devoted large chapter of his book to discernment, namely Step 26. In particular, he writes that \"those who wish to learn the will of the Lord must first mortify their own will. Then, having prayed to God with faith and honest simplicity, and having asked the fathers or even the brothers with humility of heart and no thought of doubt, they should accept their advice as from the mouth of God, even if their advice be contrary to their own view, and even if those consulted are not very spiritual. For God is not unjust, and will not lead astray souls who with faith and innocence humbly submit to the advice and judgment of their neighbour. Even if those who were asked were brute beasts, yet He who speaks is the Immaterial and Invisible One. Those who allow themselves to be guided by this rule without having any doubts are filled with great humility. For if someone expounded his problems on a harp,(Cf. Psalm 48, 4) how much better, do you think, can a rational mind and reasonable soul teach than an inanimate object\"; \"some of those who were seeking the will of God laid aside all attachments; they submitted to the Lord their own thought about this or that inclination of the soul, I mean whether to perform an action or to resist it; they submitted their mind stripped of its own will to Him, offering fervent prayer for a set number of days. In this way they attained to a knowledge of His will, either through the spiritual Mind spiritually communicating with their mind or through the complete disappearance from their soul of their cherished intention. Others  on  account  of  the  trouble  and  distractions  which  attended  their  undertaking  concluded that these disturbances came from God, according to him who said: We wanted to come to you time and again but Satan hindered us. (Thess 2.18) Others,  on  the  contrary,  recognized  that  their  action  was  pleasing  to  God  from  its  unexpected success, declaring: God co-operates with everyone who deliberately chooses to do good. He who has obtained God within him through illumination, both in actions requiring haste and in actions allowing of delay, is assured of His will by the second way, only without a definite period of time\". Athanasius of Crete comments on the last phrase that when discerning God's will, the ones who have God in them do not look at the obstacles but look at the God's help in the matter. Also, \"in all our actions, the intention must be sought from the Lord, whether in those that require haste or in those that require to be postponed. For all actions free from attachment and from all impurity will be imputed to us for good if they have been done especially for the Lord\u2019s sake and not for anyone else, even though these deeds are not entirely good\".<ref>St. John Climacus.

Regarding discernment of subtle thoughts he says, following [[Nilus of Sinai]] and [[Hesychius of Jerusalem]], that one should cut out all thoughts, both good and evil: the ascetic should keep the mind \"deaf and dumb\" and keep the heart free of any thought, even if it seemed good; because, from experience, passionate thoughts follow dispassionate ones.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[https://mospat.ru/church-and-time/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/journal49.pdf Archbishop Ambrose of Gatchina.

Path to Salvation. Short Review of Ascetics. Part III.]</ref>\n\n[[Barsanuphius of Palestine|Barsanuphius the Great]] writes in \"Letters\" that in order to become spiritual and be able to discern, the person should put away not only sins but natural desires as well (Letter 124). That is, the very topic is for the ones with high measures. Otherwise, there is a danger of being ridiculed and deceived by the demons. Only after such preface, St. Barsanuphius writes: \"do nothing without counsel\"(Cf. Sir 32.19) even if it appears to be good to you; for the light of the demons is later revealed as darkness. If, then, you hear or think or see something, with the slightest turmoil in your heart, then learn that this comes from the demons\". In other words (in Letter 21), \"every thought that does not previously possess the calmness of humility is not according to God but is clearly a form of righteousness coming from the left hand. For our Lord comes with calmness, whereas all that comes from the adversary occurs with turmoil and the commotion of wrath; indeed, if they seem to put on \u201csheep\u2019s clothing,\u201d you should know that \u201cinwardly, they are ravenous wolves.\u201d (Mt 7.15) So they are manifested by their turmoil. For it is said: \u201cYou shall know them by their fruits.\u201d (Mt 7.16)\". When there is nobody to ask, St. Barsanuphius advises to pray 3 times (for 3 days in a row or, in case of emergency, 3 times in one day (Cf. Mt 26.44)) about every deed we want to know about whether it is from God or from the demons, and observe where the heart inclines, even to the slightest degree.<ref>[http://oprelesti.ru/index.php/what-is-spiritual-delusion/671-about-discernment-of-thoughts Sts. Barsanuphius and John the Prophet. Extracts from the Letters about Discernment.]</ref> Note that Letter 21 (where St. Barsanuphius tells how to discern a thought without counsel) was written to abba John who was preparing for hermitic life.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[http://www.pravenc.ru/text/376982.html Orthodox Encyclopedia. Barsanuphius the Great.]</ref> That is, discernment without counsel is allowed by St. Barsanuphius when absolutely necessary because hermits visit people rarely. In another place (Letter 265 of abba Dorotheos) St. Barsanuphius writes that he prays that God granted abba Dorotheos the gift of discernment, but without heart labor no one gets it (in the Russian translation, it is translated as \"pain\" or \"trouble\" instead of \"labor\").\n\n===Divine and demonic help===\nWhen someone prays to God, his prayer is executed and he receives \"help\", but at this moment, he feels pride, that is a sign of demonic origin of this \"help\". St. Barsanuphius says: \"when you have been praying and feel that your prayer has been heard, if indeed you are elated, it is clear that yon have neither prayed according to God nor have you received the help of God, but rather the feeling that worked in you was from the demons so that your heart might be elated. For whenever assistance comes from God, the soul is never elated; instead, it is always humbled. The soul will be amazed at how the great mercy of God condescends to show mercy on sinners, who are unworthy and who always irritate him. And that soul offers exceeding thanks to his glorious and ineffable goodness; for he has not handed us what accords with our sins, but rather, in his great forbearance, he shows long-suffering and mercy. And so the soul is no longer elated, but [only trembles] and gives glory.\"<ref>Sts. Barsanuphius and John the Prophet. Letters. Letter 421.</ref>\n\n===Discernment of night dreams===\nSimilar to discernment of thoughts, confusion and turmoil after a night dream is the sign of its demonic origin. St. Theophan the Recluse writes in a letter: \"your night dream should not be trusted already because it confused you.\"<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[https://www.optina.ru/lec_mac/42/#128 Letters of Macarius of Optina. Prelest.]</ref> Elder Joseph the Hesychast also writes in a letter about disturbance after demonic dreams: \"however, one must be cautious and discerning here, too, my child, and must not believe in dreams, but must recognize whether they are from God or from the demons. But since not everyone has this discernment, one should not believe in them at all. However, dreams from God can be recognized. Sometimes one sees them in deep sleep, other times in a light sleep, as if sleeping but not really sleeping and for a short duration. And when he wakes up, he is full of joy, and his mind meditates on them, and they bring him theoria. For years and years he brings them to mind, and they are unforgettable. On the contrary, dreams from the demons fill the soul with disturbance. When one wakes up and the mind tries to recall them, he is filled with fear, and his heart does not accept them. But even during sleep as he sees them, they are not stationary, but they change into forms and shapes, into places and ways, into actions and movements. From these changes and the disturbance and the unpleasantness, you are able to recognize where they are from. There are also other things proceeding from the imagination and from overeating, but it is not necessary to point them out.\"<ref>Elder Joseph the Hesychast. Monastic Wisdom. Epistle to Hesychast Hermit. Ch. 5.</ref> \n\nSt. Ambrose of Optina also says that it is better not to believe night dreams at all: if one will believe dreams, he can go completely mad.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[https://www.optina.ru/starets/amvrosiy_letters_chart2_42/#424 Letters of St. Ambrose of Optina.

On dreams and Visions. 2016. P. 199]</ref> that true miracles must:\n* be worthy of the name of God and must be contained in the Holy Scriptures and Holy Tradition;\n* be accomplished by the means by which the Savior and His saints performed miracles;\n* not deny each other and do not oppose one to the other;\n* not contradict the Scripture and Sacred Tradition;\n* have the salvation of the human soul as the goal;\n* provide benefit for and promote spiritual life, not death and sin.\n\nThe one who performs true miracles must:\n* tell only the truth, lead a blameless life and not pursue personal interests and selfish goals;\n* correct the morals of those who see a miracle and\n* give these people the confidence and power of the Spirit of God;\n* testify of the work of God's Providence.\n\n===Three renunciations===\n\nHoly Fathers write that it is impossible to receive the gift of discernment without \"three renunciations\": separation from the world, inner fight with passions, acquisition of prayer and deep spiritual knowledge. [[Evagrius Ponticus|Evagrius]] writes: \"it is impossible to receive knowledge without having made the first, second, and third renunciation[s]. The first renunciation is to voluntarily leave all worldly things for the knowledge of God; the second is the casting aside of evil which occurs through the grace of Christ our Savior and the zeal of the human person; the third renunciation is separation from ignorance concerning those things that are naturally manifested to people in accordance with their state.\" <ref>[http://www.ldysinger.com/Evagrius/04_Peri-Log/00a_start.htm Evagrius. On thoughts. Ch 26.]</ref> Other Fathers specify the renunciations differently, but this is not a contradiction but a supplement. St. John Cassian writes: \"The first is that by which as far as the body is concerned we make light of all the wealth and goods of this world; the second, that by which we reject the fashions and vices and former affections of soul and flesh; the third, that by which we detach our soul from all present and visible things, and contemplate only things to come, and set our heart on what is invisible.\" <ref>[https://st-takla.org/books/en/ecf/211/2110624.html St. John Cassian. Conferences. Conference of Abbot Paphnutius. Ch. 6. An account of the three sorts of renunciations.]</ref> St. John Climacus writes: \"no one can enter crowned into the heavenly bridechamber without first making the three renunciations. He has to turn away from worldly concerns, from men, from family; he must cut selfishness away; and thirdly, he must rebuff the vanity that follows obedience.\" <ref>St. John Climacus. The Ladder of Divine Ascent. Step 2. 9.</ref>\n\n===Cases of right and wrong discernment===\nWhen something demonic is accepted as Divine, i.e. when there is an error in discernment of spirits, this may result in [[Prelest|spiritual delusion]] because the latter by the definition of St. Ignatius (Brianchaninov) is \"man\u2019s assimilation of falsehood which he accepts as truth\". The degree of delusion is the degree of such assimilation. There are many stories in the lives of the saints when people were deceived by false visions of the demons in the form of Lord Jesus and Angels (2 Cor 11:14). For example, [[Nicetas of Novgorod]]. In the early life, he was deluded by an \"angel\" as if being sent to help him after he recklessly attempted the feat of seclusion.<ref>[https://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2011/01/saint-nikitas-of-kiev-caves-and-bishop.html Living of St. Nikitas of the Kiev Caves.]</ref> \n\nSt. [[Symeon the Stylite]] was deluded by demons who showed him a chariot wanting to take him to Heaven as it was with Prophet Elias. The chariot disappeared when St. Symeon wanted to enter it but made the sign of the Cross.<ref>{{in lang|ru}}[http://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%96%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D1%81%D0%B2%D1%8F%D1%82%D1%8B%D1%85_%28%D0%94%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%29/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D1%8F%D0%B1%D1%80%D1%8C/1 Living of Saint Symeon the Stylite]</ref>\n\nWhen St. Pachomius the Great was living in solitude, the Devil appeared in front of him as \"Christ\" and said: \"Greetings, Pachomius, I am Christ paying you a visit, my faithful friend.\" But St. Pachomius was in turmoil and had confusing thoughts. So he understood the delusion and rejected the vision: \"Devil, depart from me, cursed are you and your visions and your insidious arts. You have no place among the servants of God.\"<ref>[http://www.vitae-patrum.org.uk/page16.html Life of St. Pachomius. Chapter XLVIII.]</ref>\n\nMore cases are described in the article about [[Prelest]].\n\n==Ignatian view (Roman Catholic)==\n\nFor [[St. Ignatius of Loyola|Ignatius of Loyola]], there are two signs to judge:  evil spirits act on the imagination and the senses, and the good spirit, upon reason and conscience.  Then, they can be judged by their mode of action and by the end they seek.<ref name=\"cathen\"/> The discernment of spirits is part of everyone's spiritual journey.  No one who is trying to make spiritual progress should attempt to do so alone - a [[spiritual director]] is required.  A director assists a Christian in examining the motives, desires, [[consolation]]s, and [[suffering|desolation]]s in one's life.  Objectively, one can know what is right from looking at the [[Ten Commandments]] and the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] in a thorough [[examination of conscience]].  But the broader picture of one's life is often not so clear.  A Christian should, according to St. Ignatius, share everything with a director who can see things objectively, without being swayed by the emotions or passion.  Discerning whether the good spirit (the influence of God, the Church, one's soul) or the bad spirit (the influence of Satan, the world, the flesh) is at work requires calm, rational reflection.  The good spirit brings us to peaceful, joyful decisions.  The bad spirit often brings us to make quick, emotional, conflicted decisions.  A spiritual director can assist both by personal experience, listening with care, and giving an objective analysis. Ignatius lays out his 23 rules for the discernment of spirits in his [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|''Spiritual Exercises'']] manual for those who direct others through [[Retreat (spiritual)#Roman Catholicism|retreats]].\n\n==Pentecostal and charismatic view==\n\nDiscernment of spirits is particularly important among [[Pentecostal]] and [[charismatic movement|charismatic]] Christians because of their emphasis on the operation of all the spiritual gifts within their churches. It becomes necessary then to be able to determine whether the exercise of a spiritual gift (such as [[prophecy]] or an [[interpretation of tongues]]) comes from the Holy Spirit, an evil spirit, or merely the human spirit.<ref name=foundations338>Guy P. Duffield and Nathaniel M. Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', 1983, (Los Angeles: Foursquare Media, 2008), p. 340-341.</ref> They believe that every Christian is able to judge and responsible for judging whether such an occurrence is helpful and edifying to the church; however, they also believe that there are those individuals who have been given the spiritual gift of discerning of spirits by the power of the Holy Spirit. It is important to note that the discerning of spirits does not involve the judging of people. The gift of discerning of spirits is also believed to be necessary in distinguishing [[demonic possession]] from mental or physical illness.<ref name=foundations497-501>Duffield and Van Cleave, ''Foundations of Pentecostal Theology'', 497-501.</ref> This is important in the actual practice of deliverance, otherwise known as exorcism or the casting out of demons, which was part of the great commission that Jesus gave his disciples and future generations of believers. According to the late Albert Taylor, in \"Ministering Below the Surface \u2013 a practical guide to Inner Healing and Deliverance\", discerning of spirits can also be learnt. \n\nAdditionally, many Charismatics and those in Pentecostal churches believe that the gift of discernment of Spirits allows certain individuals to see spirits. The story about Elisha and the host of angels (cf. 2 Kings 6:15-17) is given as an example along with many other modern examples in the Book 'School of the Seers' by Dr. Jonathan Welton.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jonathan |last=Welton|title=The School of the Seers: A Practical Guide on How to See in the Unseen Realm|location= [[Shippensburg, Pennsylvania]]|publisher= Destiny Image Publishers|year= 2009}}</ref>\n\nDiscernment is the ability to make wise decisions in difficult situations.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Psychometry (paranormal)]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05028b.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' \"Discernment of Spirits\"]\n*[http://www.didymus.org/rules-for-the-discerning-of-spirits.html Rules for the Discerning of Spirits: A Brief Summary of the Church's Traditional Teaching ]\n\n{{Private revelation}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Catholic theology and doctrine]]\n[[Category:Catholic spirituality]]\n[[Category:Spiritual gifts]]\n", "name_user": "John B123", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changed <references> to reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discernment_of_Spirits"}

Such actions are motivated by reports showing younger generations shunning terrestrial TV, and PSBs have been told to adapt to avoid becoming insignificant.\n\n=== Establishment of joint venture & US launch ===\nTalks between the BBC and ITV to launch a Netflix-style streaming service took place in March 2016, with [[NBCUniversal]] also initially in the talks.\n\nFollowing increased competition for the public service broadcasters from streaming giants, the BBC and ITV announced plans to create a Netflix-style TV service.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/13/bbc-and-itv-to-launch-britbox-on-demand-service-in-us|title=BBC and ITV to launch BritBox on-demand service in US|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=2016-12-13|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> The BBC and ITV did announce several shows they will be running on Britbox including ''New Blood'', ''Tutankhamun'', ''The Moonstone, In The Dark,'' Cold ''Feet'' and crime series ''Silent Witness'' on launch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitaltveurope.com/2016/12/14/bbc-itv-amc-pact-for-britbox-us-svod-service/|title=BBC, ITV, AMC pact for BritBox US SVOD service|date=2016-12-14|website=Digital TV Europe|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n=== International expansion ===\n\n==== Launch in Canada ====\nOn 14 February 2018, BritBox launched in Canada. Soumya Sriraman, President, BritBox North America, said, \u201cWe know that Canadians have a deep affinity for British culture and the extraordinary television programs produced in the UK, so launching BritBox in Canada has always been at the top of our list. The fact that we can also, for the first time ever, premiere some of the most popular British programs and big special events such as Trooping the Colour as soon as 24 hours after their UK premiere is \u2013 hopefully \u2013 the cherry on the sundae.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/britbox-launches-canada|title=BritBox Launches in Canada|website=Press Centre|language=en|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Launch in UK ====\nIn February 2019, it was announced that BritBox would be launched in the UK later in the year as a rival to [[Netflix]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47383559|title=BBC and ITV set to launch Netflix rival|date=27 February 2019|work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> Journalist [[Mark Lawson]] likened the proposed project to [[BBC Worldwide]]'s previous failed platform, Project Kangaroo, which was expected to launch in 2008, and described it as \"bizarre\" and \"hugely risky\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/27/britbox-this-bizarre-netflix-rival-will-surely-bomb|title=BritBox: the bizarre Netflix rival that will surely bomb|date=27 February 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> In March 2019, [[Channel 4]] confirmed interest in collaborating with the [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].<ref name=\"Channel 4\">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a26751093/channel-4-boss-confirms-interest-joining-britbox-alongside-bbc-itv/|title=Channel 4 boss confirms interest in joining BritBox alongside BBC and ITV|last1=Mehmedova|first1=Filiz|date=7 March 2019|publisher=[[DigitalSpy]]|accessdate=9 March 2019}}</ref> Currently, ''McMafia'', ''Last Tango in Halifax'', ''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' and the sitcom ''Gavin & Stacey'' have been confirmed to be available on the UK version.<ref name=\"Channel 4\" />\n\nIn July 2019, the BBC and ITV announced they had signed an agreement to launch BritBox in the UK in the last quarter of 2019.<ref>[https://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail/ITV/14155960.html Full Stream Ahead for BritBox in UK as ITV & BBC Sign Agreement] ITV 19 July 2019</ref> \n\nOn 20 September 2019, ITV announced they had reached a deal with Viacom (now ViacomCBS) for Channel 5 and Comedy Central UK content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/britbox/press-releases/channel-5-and-comedy-central-join-britbox-line|title=Channel 5 and Comedy Central join BritBox line-up|website=Press Centre}}</ref> This was followed by an announcement on 27 September that Samsung TVs, Freeview Play and YouView would be the first distribution platforms <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/britbox/press-releases/britbox-confirms-first-wave-distribution-partners|title=BritBox confirms first wave of distribution partners|website=Press Centre}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, BritBox launched its [[Beta release|\"testing phase\"]] (beta) in the United Kingdom, in which users can sign up for a free trial to have a \"snapshot of what will be there at launch\".<ref name=\"trial\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2019-10-15/britbox-releases-beta-version-free-trial/|title=Britbox releases Beta version for users to sign up to 30 day free trial|last=Carr|first=Flora|date=15 October 2019|website=Radio Times|access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOne day before UK launch, on 6 November 2019, the Guardian reported that Channel 4 is to join BritBox after the two signed a 3-year deal to provide 1000+ hours of content from All 4 \"with a range of comedy, drama and non-scripted programmes from across the service, including new series, and for the first time to any streamer, an exclusive Film4 curated service featuring iconic British films\".<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\"itv.com\" /> This means for the first time, all the UK's traditional channels have managed to successfully bring together programmes on a single streaming service.

BritBox is anticipated to launch in Australia in later 2020 with British content from across the past decades, including classic and contemporary box sets from the UK, to be directly available to Australian viewers via a wide range of mobile and connected home devices.\n\nBritBox Australia will be run as a 50/50 Joint Venture between ITV and BBC Studios, and ITV says, the service will draw on the experience of the teams and technology used to successfully launch BritBox in North America and the UK while also recruiting a local team to conduct Australian operations.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/britbox-launch-australia|title=BritBox To Launch In Australia|website=Press Centre|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n=== One million users & profitability ===\nOn 5 December 2019, ITV's subscription video on demand Group Director Reemah Sakaan said in an interview that the service in North America, reached profitability<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/55970875|title=ITV, BBC's BritBox hits profit in North America, coming to more devices in UK|website=www.spglobal.com|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>, this was followed in 2020 by news, the service in NA surpassed 1 million users.<ref name=\":10\" /> A research study commissioned by the UK media regulator [[Ofcom]] previously predicted that BritBox could grab 2 million UK subscribers by the year 2023, alongside newly launched U.S.-based SVODs [[Disney+]] and [[Apple TV+]].\n\n== Ownership ==\nBritBox is a joint venture of BBC Studios and ITV plc, shown in the tagline \"by BBC & ITV\".

In response to this, BritBox has announced that it would not include classic homegrown series that are deemed to be inappropriate for modern audiences.\n\nBritBox bosses have said a range of older shows, such as the BBC's ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'' and ''[[It Ain't Half Hot Mum]]'', as well as ITV's ''[[Love Thy Neighbour (1972 TV series)|Love Thy Neighbour]]'', will not appear on the service because of content deemed racist or otherwise unacceptable.<ref name=\"TuckerHudson\">{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Grant|last2=Hudson|first2=Jack|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/britbox-opens-up-racist-doctor-who-can-of-worms-kv9pt68x5|title=BritBox opens up 'racist Doctor Who' can of worms|work=The Sunday Times|date=8 March 2020|access-date=8 March 2020}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Reemah Sakaan, the senior ITV executive responsible for launching the subscription video-on-demand service, said \u201cWe also recomply everything that goes on to BritBox [with modern TV viewing standards]. There\u2019s also the ability to create bespoke warnings around key programming.\u201d\n\nSakaan confirmed that ''Till Death Us Do Part'', first aired on [[BBC One|BBC1]] in 1965, which features the bigoted character [[Alf Garnett]], and ITV's 1970s series ''Love Thy Neighbour'', a sitcom about a [[West Indian]] couple who move next door to a [[White British]] couple, will not appear on the service. Some individual episodes of some shows that appear on BritBox such as BBC's ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial from the original run (''[[The Talons of Weng-Chiang]]'', 1977) are also deemed problematic. In the ''Doctor Who'' serial, people of Chinese extraction are termed \"inscrutable Chinks\" and an English actor performs in \"yellowface\". However, it is understood that no ''Fawlty Towers'' episodes will be cut from the service but will run with warnings of offensive language instead. The ''Doctor Who'' serial from 1977 has a warning attached indicating \"Contains stereotypes that some may find offensive.\"<ref name=\"TuckerHudson\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/nov/07/britbox-uk-networks-plan-to-tackle-netflix-amazon-and-apple-tv|title=BritBox: 'inappropriate' classic UK TV shows to be kept off service|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=2019-11-07|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-11-13|last2=Waterson|first2=Jim|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-exclusive deals ===\nThe sale of rights to BBC and Channel 5 content has caused some reporters to be wary of BritBox's viability as a platform for new content, due to deals with larger SVODs to exclusively stream newer BBC content and non-exclusive deals with Sky and Now TV to access Channel 5 box sets.<ref name=\"Amaya\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicon.com/2019/08/01/hbo-max-gets-doctor-who-and-other-bbc-series-in-new-streaming-deal/|title=HBO Max Gets Doctor Who And Other BBC Series In New Streaming Deal|last=Amaya|first=Erik|date=2019-08-01|website=COMICON|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> However, many BBC Studios' deals have given licences to some of its content to many other SVODs on a non-exclusive basis.

This followed the launches of the broadcasters' own video-on-demand services.\n\nOn Wednesday, 4 February 2009, Project Kangaroo was blocked by the then [[Competition Commission]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/04/project-kangaroo-blocked-by-competition-commission|title=Project Kangaroo blocked by Competition Commission|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=2009-02-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> \n\nThe commission stated that the case surrounding Kangaroo was about the control of valuable UK-originated TV content. \"BBC Worldwide, ITV and Channel 4 together control the vast majority of this material, which puts them in a very strong position as wholesalers of TV content to restrict competition from other current and future providers of video-on-demand services to UK viewers,\" said Peter Freeman, the chairman of the Competition Commission, in its final report on Project Kangaroo. \"We thought viewers would benefit from better video-on-demand [VoD] services if the parties \u2013 possibly in conjunction with other new and/or already established providers of VoD \u2013 competed with each other.\"\n\nA Channel 4 spokesperson said at the time, \"This is a disproportionate remedy and a missed opportunity in the further development of British broadcasting.\"\n\nAfter the planned Project Kangaroo was blocked, the system's assets were sold to transmitter firm [[Arqiva]] and this led to the development of the service [[SeeSaw (Internet television)|SeeSaw]], which operated from February 2010 to October 2011, with content from the BBC, Channel 4, and Channel 5, some of which (such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'') now appears on BritBox.\n\n=== Rise of streaming ===\nSince the rise of [[Netflix]] and subsequent other Subscription Video on Demand services (SVODs), [[Europe|European]] PSBs and media companies in particular, have started to find ways to compete with the increasing dominance of American SVODs, and many old rivalries have also been put aside in Europe and to collaborate by creating joint SVODs, such the like of BritBox but also [[France]]'s Salto (backed by networks [[TF1 Group|TF1]], [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]] and [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]]), and [[Germany|German]]-based [[:de:Joyn_(Streaminganbieter)|Joyn]] (a joint venture between [[ProSiebenSat.1 Media|ProSiebenSat.1]] and [[Discovery, Inc.|Discovery]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/european-broadcasters-unite-take-netflix-global-streamers-1217336|title=A European Union of TV?

Some individual episodes of some shows that appear on BritBox such as BBC's ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial from the original run (''[[The Talons of Weng-Chiang]]'', 1977) are also deemed problematic.

In this context, \"integrity\" means \"behave as intended\", and a \"platform\" is any computer device regardless of its [[operating system]]. It is to ensure that the [[boot process]] starts from a trusted combination of hardware and software, and continues until the operating system has fully booted and [[Application software|applications]] are running.\n\nThe responsibility of assuring said integrity using TPM is with the firmware and the operating system. For example, [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface]] (UEFI) can use TPM to form a [[Root of Trust|root of trust]]: The TPM contains several Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) that allow secure storage and reporting of security relevant metrics. These metrics can be used to detect changes to previous configurations and decide how to proceed. Good examples can be found in [[Linux Unified Key Setup]] (LUKS),<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web | url = https://github.com/shpedoikal/tpm-luks | title = LUKS support for storing keys in TPM NVRAM | year = 2013 | accessdate = December 19, 2013 | website = github.com}}</ref> [[BitLocker]] and [[PrivateCore]] vCage memory encryption. (See below.)\n\nAn example of TPM use for platform integrity is the [[Trusted Execution Technology]] (TXT), which creates a chain of trust. It could remotely attest that a computer is using the specified hardware and software.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/trusted-execution-technology-security-paper.pdf|title=Intel Trusted Execution Technology|last=Greene|first=James|year=2012|publisher=Intel|type=white paper|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Disk encryption===\n[[Full disk encryption]] utilities, such as [[dm-crypt]] and [[BitLocker]], can use this technology to protect the keys used to encrypt the computer's storage devices and provide integrity [[authentication]] for a trusted boot pathway that includes firmware and [[boot sector]].\n\n===Password protection===\nOperating systems often require [[authentication]] (involving a [[password]] or other means) to protect keys, data or systems. If the authentication mechanism is implemented in software only, the access is prone to [[dictionary attack]]s. Since TPM is implemented in a dedicated hardware module, a dictionary attack prevention mechanism was built in, which effectively protects against guessing or automated dictionary attacks, while still allowing the user a sufficient and reasonable number of tries. Without this level of protection, only passwords with high complexity would provide sufficient protection.\n\n===Other uses and concerns===\nAny application can use a TPM chip for:\n* [[Digital rights management]]\n* Protection and enforcement of [[software license]]s\n* Prevention of [[cheating in online games]]<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book| format = Google Books | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cUhpq98Zb8AC&pg=PA124 |title= Autonomic and Trusted Computing: 4th International Conference | publisher = ATC | year = 2007 | accessdate= May 31, 2014| isbn = 9783540735465 }}</ref>\n\nOther uses exist, some of which give rise to [[privacy]] concerns.

They are theoretically the most secure type of TPM because the routines implemented in hardware should be{{Vague|date=September 2019}} more resistant to {{clarify |date=September 2019 |reason=Hardware bugs or software bugs? |text=bugs}} versus routines implemented in software, and their packages are required to implement some tamper resistance.\n* '''Integrated TPMs''' are part of another chip. While they use hardware that resists software bugs, they are not required to implement tamper resistance. [[Intel]] has integrated TPMs in some of its [[chipset]]s.\n* '''Firmware TPMs''' are software-only solutions that run in a CPU's [[trusted execution environment]]. Since these TPMs are entirely software solutions that run in trusted execution environments, these TPMs are more likely to be vulnerable to software bugs. AMD, Intel and Qualcomm have implemented firmware TPMs.\n* '''Software TPMs''' are software emulators of TPMs that run with no more protection than a regular program gets within an operating system. They depend entirely on the environment that they run in, so they provide no more security than what can be provided by the normal execution environment, and they are vulnerable to their own software bugs and attacks that are penetrating the normal execution environment. They are useful for development purposes.\n* '''Virtual TPMs''' are provided by a [[hypervisor]].

11889''') is an international standard for a [[secure cryptoprocessor]], a dedicated microcontroller designed to secure hardware through integrated cryptographic keys.\n\n== History ==\nTrusted Platform Module (TPM) was conceived by a [[computer industry]] consortium called [[Trusted Computing Group]] (TCG), and was standardized by [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and  [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) in 2009 as ISO/IEC 11889.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50970 |title=ISO/IEC 11889-1:2009 \u2013

In this context, \"integrity\" means \"behave as intended\", and a \"platform\" is any computer device regardless of its [[operating system]]. It is to ensure that the [[boot process]] starts from a trusted combination of hardware and software, and continues until the operating system has fully booted and [[Application software|applications]] are running.\n\nThe responsibility of assuring said integrity using TPM is with the firmware and the operating system. For example, [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface]] (UEFI) can use TPM to form a [[Root of Trust|root of trust]]: The TPM contains several Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) that allow secure storage and reporting of security relevant metrics. These metrics can be used to detect changes to previous configurations and decide how to proceed. Good examples can be found in [[Linux Unified Key Setup]] (LUKS),<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web | url = https://github.com/shpedoikal/tpm-luks | title = LUKS support for storing keys in TPM NVRAM | year = 2013 | accessdate = December 19, 2013 | website = github.com}}</ref> [[BitLocker]] and [[PrivateCore]] vCage memory encryption. (See below.)\n\nAn example of TPM use for platform integrity is the [[Trusted Execution Technology]] (TXT), which creates a chain of trust. It could remotely attest that a computer is using the specified hardware and software.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/white-papers/trusted-execution-technology-security-paper.pdf|title=Intel Trusted Execution Technology|last=Greene|first=James|year=2012|publisher=Intel|type=white paper|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Disk encryption===\n[[Full disk encryption]] utilities, such as [[dm-crypt]] and [[BitLocker]], can use this technology to protect the keys used to encrypt the computer's storage devices and provide integrity [[authentication]] for a trusted boot pathway that includes firmware and [[boot sector]].\n\n===Password protection===\nOperating systems often require [[authentication]] (involving a [[password]] or other means) to protect keys, data or systems. If the authentication mechanism is implemented in software only, the access is prone to [[dictionary attack]]s. Since TPM is implemented in a dedicated hardware module, a dictionary attack prevention mechanism was built in, which effectively protects against guessing or automated dictionary attacks, while still allowing the user a sufficient and reasonable number of tries. Without this level of protection, only passwords with high complexity would provide sufficient protection.\n\n===Other uses and concerns===\nAny application can use a TPM chip for:\n* [[Digital rights management]]\n* Protection and enforcement of [[software license]]s\n* Prevention of [[cheating in online games]]<ref name=\":2\">{{cite book| format = Google Books | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cUhpq98Zb8AC&pg=PA124 |title= Autonomic and Trusted Computing: 4th International Conference | publisher = ATC | year = 2007 | accessdate= May 31, 2014| isbn = 9783540735465 }}</ref>\n\nOther uses exist, some of which give rise to [[privacy]] concerns.

They are theoretically the most secure type of TPM because the routines implemented in hardware should be{{Vague|date=September 2019}} more resistant to {{clarify |date=September 2019 |reason=Hardware bugs or software bugs? |text=bugs}} versus routines implemented in software, and their packages are required to implement some tamper resistance.\n* '''Integrated TPMs''' are part of another chip. While they use hardware that resists software bugs, they are not required to implement tamper resistance. [[Intel]] has integrated TPMs in some of its [[chipset]]s.\n* '''Firmware TPMs''' are software-only solutions that run in a CPU's [[trusted execution environment]]. Since these TPMs are entirely software solutions that run in trusted execution environments, these TPMs are more likely to be vulnerable to software bugs. AMD, Intel and Qualcomm have implemented firmware TPMs.\n* '''Software TPMs''' are software emulators of TPMs that run with no more protection than a regular program gets within an operating system. They depend entirely on the environment that they run in, so they provide no more security than what can be provided by the normal execution environment, and they are vulnerable to their own software bugs and attacks that are penetrating the normal execution environment. They are useful for development purposes.\n* '''Virtual TPMs''' are provided by a [[hypervisor]]. Therefore, they rely on the hypervisor to provide them with an isolated execution environment that is hidden from the software running inside [[virtual machines]] to secure their code from the software in the virtual machines. They can provide a security level comparable to a firmware TPM.\n\nThe official TCG reference implementation of the TPM 2.0 Specification has been developed by [[Microsoft]].
