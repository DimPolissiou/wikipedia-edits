While the mission is to contribute to the transformation of smallholder farmers\u2019 lives by: \n* understanding the constraints to animal health and how to overcome them; \n* engaging the animal health industry; and\u00a0 \n* ensuring awareness, availability and adoption of effective animal health interventions. \n \n\nThe intended beneficiaries of GALVmed's work are many of the 900 million people worldwide who rely on livestock for their livelihoods.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moredun|title= Visit Bill Gates discuss progress development livestock vaccines|url= http://www.moredun.org.uk/news/visit-bill-gates-discuss-progress-development-livestock-vaccines}}</ref>\n\nGALVmed's purpose is \"protecting livestock, improving human lives\" and its mission is to make a real difference to the livelihoods of resource poor farmers by providing animal health tools within a sustainable economic framework.<ref>{{cite web|last=Charity Commission|title=Register of Charities|url=\thttp://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1115606&SubsidiaryNumber=0}}</ref>\n\nGALVmed achieves its aims by: catalysing interactions with and between others as well as facilitating, supporting and forming partnerships (e.g. veterinarians, governments, policy makers, NGOs) and employing consultants.\n\n==History==\nOriginally GALVmed was known as the Global Alliance for Livestock Vaccines (GALV). GALV was founded in 2004. \nEarlier, in the early 2000s,scoping work under the DFID Animal Health Programme (AHP),<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Animal Health Programme|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50007/}}</ref> identified the need for an organisation to promote the creation of a consortium to invest in research to produce livestock vaccines, diagnostics and other products for the control of tropical livestock diseases, which the private pharmaceutical sector was not  funding at the time. \nAs a result, the AHP went on to facilitate the establishment of GALV with an appropriate legal and institutional framework and its first business plan. It was envisaged that GALV would work in a similar way to the [[GAVI Alliance]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Web Archives|title=Archives|url=http://www.dfid-ahp.org.uk/downloads/Ann_Rep_2004-5_-_FINAL.pdf|archive-date=October 19, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019235440/http://www.dfid-ahp.org.uk/downloads/Ann_Rep_2004-5_-_FINAL.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> a similar organisation but with a human health agenda.\n\nThe inception phase of GALV ran from October 2004 to March 2005. It was funded through a \u00a3300,000 grant from [[DFID]] with the objective of establishing a global public-private partnership to develop new vaccines against diseases that inflict the livestock of poor people.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50092/Default.aspx}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the brief inception phase, DFID provided GALV (later GALVmed) with core and project funding totalling UK\u00a35.6 million during the period April 2005 to November 2011. Of this total, \u00a33 million was joint funding in partnership with the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] (BMGF)for phase 1 of what is now known as the Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed). This change of name reflected the recognition by GALV/GALVmed's management and board that although vaccines were important, the development of other types of veterinary medicines, including drugs, would also be relevant in some cases. Together DFID and BMGF provided a total of \u00a320 million for phase 1, which was scheduled to run from September 2008 until August 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50092/Default.aspx}}</ref>\n\nThroughout GALVmed phase 1, the organisation had as its mission statement and strapline \"protecting livestock, saving human life\" (PLSHL).Known as the PLSHL project, protecting livestock reflected the predominant focus on preventive veterinary medicines, especially vaccines, while saving human life indicated that two of the four key diseases GALVmed was targeting were [[zoonotic]]. The stated goal for phase 1 was to improve the health of livestock and increase food security and human health of poor livestock keepers in low-income countries.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50092/Default.aspx}}</ref> \nDuring phase 1, GALVmed focused on four key diseases: [[East Coast fever]] (ECF) that affects cattle, [[Rift Valley fever]] (RVF)that affects cattle, sheep, goats, camels and also people, porcine cysticercosis, that affects pigs and also people, and [[Newcastle disease]], that affects poultry.\n\nFor these diseases, GALVmed and partners aimed to identify suitable mechanisms for the development of control tools (vaccines, diagnostics and pharmaceuticals) and to facilitate their access and adoption. They also aimed to develop data-driven decision making tools and to communicate, network and support advocacy and global access strategy requirements of project delivery.<br />\n \nThe PLSHL project also comprised funding to assess existing vaccines and diagnostics on a further three diseases: [[contagious caprine pleuropneumonia]] (CCPP), that is a sheep and goat disease, [[contagious bovine pleuropneumonia]](CBPP), that is a cattle disease and [[peste des petits ruminants]] (PPR), which is sheep and goat disease. In addition, exploratory activities were undertaken on [[African swine fever]].\n\nBy the end of phase 1, DFID reported that GALVmed and partners had made four vaccines available to poor livestock keepers. Two vaccines, one for the tick-borne cattle disease ECF and one emergency vaccine for the cattle, sheep and goat disease RVF, were reported to be already in wide use in Africa.\n\nPhase 2 followed with another joint funding of US$51 million from BMGF (80 percent) and DFID (20 percent). It ran from 2012 to 2017. In commenting on the awarding of the phase 2 grant, the UK International Development Secretary, Andrew Mitchell, explained that, \u201cGALVmed has pioneered work to identify vaccines, medicine and early diagnostic solutions to tackle some of the most devastating livestock diseases that affect poor farmers in the developing world. This new funding from the British taxpayer and from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will ensure that these innovative solutions are produced at scale and that solutions can get to those who need them most, at an affordable price.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|title= Gates Foundation and the UK Government award GALVmed additional US$ 51 million|url= http://www.galvmed.org/gates-foundation-and-dfid-award-galvmed-additional-us-51-million}}</ref>\n \nIn view of the progress made during GALVmed phase 1 and 2, BMGF and DFID decided to jointly fund a new programme, Veterinary Innovations Transforming Animal Health and Livelihoods (VITAL) which will run from 2018 to 2022. The VITAL programme aims to make a significant contribution towards transformational change in the smallholder livestock health landscape by developing a portfolio of high impact products and initiating a range of private sector market initiatives operating at scale in the smallholder sector. For the VITAL programme, DFID and BMGF jointly committed to providing US$50 million with DFID contributing 20 percent and BMGF 80 percent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Charity Commission|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/SIR/ENDS06/0001115606_SIR_20130331_E.PDF}}</ref>\n\nIn awarding the VITAL funding, Bill Gates, who is the co-Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said that \"for over a billion people living in the world\u2019s poorest countries, agriculture and livestock are a lifeline out of poverty. The science and research being led by the great minds here in Edinburgh are making huge strides in improving the health and productivity of livestock. With this investment in GALVmed, we can take advantage of the UK\u2019s leading R&D capabilities to fight the spread of livestock diseases, both protecting animals in the developing world and here in the UK. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2019s investment of $40 million dollars will help GALVmed make vaccines, medicines and diagnostics accessible to millions of the world\u2019s poorest smallholder farmers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.galvmed.org/news/bill-gates-visits-edinburgh-showcase-british-excellence-research-development-announces-new-40-million-investment-galvmed-boost-british-livestock-research-worlds-poore/|title=Bill Gates visits Edinburgh to showcase British excellence in research and development and Announces new $40 million investment in GALVmed to boost British livestock research for world\u2019s poorest people|website=GALVmed|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-27}}\n</ref> \n\nWhile the focus for GALVmed phase 1 and 2 was targeting specific diseases such Newcastle disease, RVF, CBPP, ECF and CCPP affecting poor smallholder farmers in Africa and south Asia, the VITAL programme focuses on delivering a portfolio of animal health products to smallholder farmers. The broad objectives of the VITAL project are (1) Developing six new high impact livestock vaccines, ready for commercial production and suitable for widespread use by smallholders in Africa and South Asia in the control of major livestock diseases. (2)Partnering the animal health industry in establishing five large scale portfolio distribution networks in Africa and Asia.

Other partners included the African Union Panafrican Veterinary Vaccine Centre (AU-PANVAC) and the centre de coop\u00e9ration internationale enrechercheagronomique pour le d\u00e9veloppement (CIRAD).\n \nGALVmed led the implementation of a VACNADA component to improve the capacity of eight African laboratories to make quality assured vaccines in more efficient ways that met internationally recognised quality standards and best practices. Staff from selected national vaccine producing laboratories, identified through a needs assessment, received training in laboratory and vaccine operation management, had their laboratory facilities upgraded and technical support provided for the implementation of quality assurance and standardisation of the production process of selected vaccines.<ref>{{cite web|last=AU-IBAR|title= Current Programmes and Projects|url= http://au-ibar.org/library/publications/57-en/programmes-and-projects/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=99&Itemid=445}}</ref><br />\n \nIn 2011, DFID awarded GALVmed an additional grant worth \u00a38,010,708 to support the development of an integrated package of tools and policies and implement it as a cost-effective control of animal African trypanosomosis (AAT). The objective was to develop a new robust field diagnostic tool for AAT, new trypanocidal drugs and to establish the basis for the development of a vaccine for AAT.  The Controlling AAT project was scheduled to run until February 2014,.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Controlling African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/60796/Default.aspx}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Controlling African Animal Trypanosomosis (AAT)|url= http://devtracker.dfid.gov.uk/projects/GB-1-202040/}}</ref><br />\n \nThe DFID funding for AAT was subsequently complemented by a grant worth US$1,421,722 awarded by BMGF in January 2014 to undergo Phase 2 of the project. The stated purpose of the BMGF grant was to develop safe and effective drugs against drug-resistant AAT as well as a diagnostic test for field diagnosis of infection in cattle and to improve the quality control of existing trypanocidal drugs used by smallholder livestock keepers in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|title= How We Work|url= http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/Quick-Links/Grants-Database/Grants/2014/01/OPP1100291}}</ref>\n\nGALVmed is also part of the consortium awarded US$1.8 million by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia BEN-1 Vaccine Evaluation project. The project is exploring the potential efficacy of a vaccine to combat [[contagious bovine pleuropneumonia]] which is a major constraint to cattle production in many areas of sub-Saharan Africa where 18 countries are reported to be affected by this disease.<ref>{{cite web|last=CAAS|title= HVRI to lead the Bill & Melinda Gates project on Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia BEN-1 Vaccine Evaluation|url= http://www.caas.cn/en/newsroom/international_cooperation_update/235999.shtml}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, GALVmed received funding from [https://agresults.org/ AgResults] to implement the Brucellosis Vaccine Prize Initiative,  a US$30 million global competition, which invites animal health innovators (\u2018Solvers\u2019) to submit their proposals for \u2013 and ultimately develop \u2013 a suitable vaccine that is efficacious, safe and viable for use against ''Brucella melitensis'' a pathogen causing Brucellosis that particularly affects smallholder farmers in the developing world.\n\nAnd in 2018, GALVmed partnered with Boehringer Ingelheim on the \u201cLastMile\u201d, the initiative which is funded by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This integrated, solutions-driven initiative aims to address crucial animal health challenges by creating consistent availability of animal medical resources in hard-to-reach areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. It targets ruminants, such as sheep, goats and cattle, and will further expand to include poultry.

In addition, product development activities were undertaken in Europe, Asia, North & Latin America and Australia.\n\nduring these phases, GALVmed worked on 12 viral, bacterial and protozoal diseases that affect cattle, sheep and goats, pigs and poultry, some of which are zoonotic. The 12 diseases are:\n\n'''Cattle diseases''':\n* East Coast fever (Theileriosis)\n* Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia\n* Trypanosomosis\n* [[Lumpy skin disease]]\n\n'''Sheep and goats diseases''':\n* Peste des petits ruminants\n* Contagious caprinepleuropneumonia\n* Sheep & goat pox\n* [[Brucellosis]]\n\n'''Pigs diseases''':\n* Porcine cysticercosis (zoonotic)\n* African swine fever\n\n'''Poultry diseases''':\n* Newcastle disease\n\n'''Multi-species diseases''':\n* Rift Valley fever (zoonotic)\n\nTwenty different veterinary products were also actively worked upon at various stages in the exploratory-proof of concept-development-registration-commercialization continuum: 11 vaccines, 4 pharmaceutical and 2 diagnostic products.\n\nUnder the '''VITAL programme''', GALVmed is undertaking two complimentary strands of work, Product Development and Market Development. \n\nThe '''Product Development''' projects include:\n* Small ruminant systemic multivalent vaccine\n* Small ruminant reproductive multivalent vaccine\n* PPR-SGP Combination vaccine\n* CBPP-LSD RVF combination vaccine\n* ND-Gumboro combination vaccine\n* Negatively marked PPR vaccine\n* ND-FP concurrent use vaccine field studies\n* Product Registration Expansion\n* ASF vaccine\n* Animal African Trypanosomosis\n* High Release Titre ND vaccine \n\n'''Market Development''' activities include:\n* Asia initiative \u2013 a manufacturer driven & led enterprise\n* East Africa initiative \u2013 multi manufacturer\n* West Africa initiative \u2013 multi manufacturer\n* West Africa \u2013 a manufacturer-distributor driven & managed entreprise\n* West Africa \u2013 upstream enterprise \n* Sensitisation of R&D products\n* Last Mile project with Boehringer Ingelheim\n\n==Key projects==\n'''Newcastle disease''': One of GALVmed's projects has focused on the prevention of Newcastle disease in the chickens kept by poor women in Nepal. \nGALVmed, in partnership with the NGO Heifer International Nepal, has established a vaccine supply system that has transformed backyard poultry keeping. Whereas previously these women regularly lost 90 percent of their small flocks to the disease, now, thanks to vaccination, they have built up profitable small-scale enterprises. These have not only enabled them to pay their children's school fees and meet medical bills, but have also empowered the women who report that they now enjoy more respect from their husbands.\n \nVaccination is carried out by trained community animal health workers who buy vaccines and offer vaccination services to the women on payment of a small fee. Following a recent assessment of the project, the BMGF concluded that, \u201cThis is possibly the easiest, quickest and most economic way of reaching out to the poor of the world with visible results in helping alleviate poverty.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last=The Times|title= Farmers take Bill Gates\u2019s \u00a325m tip: care for the animals to beat poverty|url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/scotland/article4307623.ece}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, GALVmed announced it was to bring Newcastle disease vaccination to 100,000 backyard poultry farmers in the Mayurbhanj district of Orissa, India. In partnership with [[Hester Biosciences|Hester Biosciences Limited]], GALVmed will use the thermostable Lasota vaccine for Newcastle disease. Although this vaccine needs to be transported and stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius, at village-level, it can be kept in room temperature for 10 days at 37 degrees Celsius. This means that the 237 local vaccinators will be able to stock up on the vaccine and not need to make frequent trips to the retailer for fresh stocks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Animal Pharm|title= India targeted in Newcastle disease vaccine plan|url= https://www.agra-net.net/agra/animal-pharm/regions/india/india-targeted-in-newcastle-disease-vaccine-plan-467426.htm}}</ref>\n\n'''East Coast fever:''' From the outset a major focus of GALVmed's work has been ECF.

GALV was founded in 2004. \nEarlier, in the early 2000s,scoping work under the DFID Animal Health Programme (AHP),<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Animal Health Programme|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50007/}}</ref> identified the need for an organisation to promote the creation of a consortium to invest in research to produce livestock vaccines, diagnostics and other products for the control of tropical livestock diseases, which the private pharmaceutical sector was not  funding at the time. \nAs a result, the AHP went on to facilitate the establishment of GALV with an appropriate legal and institutional framework and its first business plan. It was envisaged that GALV would work in a similar way to the [[GAVI Alliance]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Web Archives|title=Archives|url=http://www.dfid-ahp.org.uk/downloads/Ann_Rep_2004-5_-_FINAL.pdf|archive-date=October 19, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019235440/http://www.dfid-ahp.org.uk/downloads/Ann_Rep_2004-5_-_FINAL.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> a similar organisation but with a human health agenda.\n\nThe inception phase of GALV ran from October 2004 to March 2005. It was funded through a \u00a3300,000 grant from [[DFID]] with the objective of establishing a global public-private partnership to develop new vaccines against diseases that inflict the livestock of poor people.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50092/Default.aspx}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the brief inception phase, DFID provided GALV (later GALVmed) with core and project funding totalling UK\u00a35.6 million during the period April 2005 to November 2011. Of this total, \u00a33 million was joint funding in partnership with the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] (BMGF)for phase 1 of what is now known as the Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed). This change of name reflected the recognition by GALV/GALVmed's management and board that although vaccines were important, the development of other types of veterinary medicines, including drugs, would also be relevant in some cases. Together DFID and BMGF provided a total of \u00a320 million for phase 1, which was scheduled to run from September 2008 until August 2015.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50092/Default.aspx}}</ref>\n\nThroughout GALVmed phase 1, the organisation had as its mission statement and strapline \"protecting livestock, saving human life\" (PLSHL).Known as the PLSHL project, protecting livestock reflected the predominant focus on preventive veterinary medicines, especially vaccines, while saving human life indicated that two of the four key diseases GALVmed was targeting were [[zoonotic]]. The stated goal for phase 1 was to improve the health of livestock and increase food security and human health of poor livestock keepers in low-income countries.<ref>{{cite web|last=DFID|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50092/Default.aspx}}</ref> \nDuring phase 1, GALVmed focused on four key diseases: [[East Coast fever]] (ECF) that affects cattle, [[Rift Valley fever]] (RVF)that affects cattle, sheep, goats, camels and also people, porcine cysticercosis, that affects pigs and also people, and [[Newcastle disease]], that affects poultry.\n\nFor these diseases, GALVmed and partners aimed to identify suitable mechanisms for the development of control tools (vaccines, diagnostics and pharmaceuticals) and to facilitate their access and adoption. They also aimed to develop data-driven decision making tools and to communicate, network and support advocacy and global access strategy requirements of project delivery.<br />\n \nThe PLSHL project also comprised funding to assess existing vaccines and diagnostics on a further three diseases: [[contagious caprine pleuropneumonia]] (CCPP), that is a sheep and goat disease, [[contagious bovine pleuropneumonia]](CBPP), that is a cattle disease and [[peste des petits ruminants]] (PPR), which is sheep and goat disease. In addition, exploratory activities were undertaken on [[African swine fever]].\n\nBy the end of phase 1, DFID reported that GALVmed and partners had made four vaccines available to poor livestock keepers. Two vaccines, one for the tick-borne cattle disease ECF and one emergency vaccine for the cattle, sheep and goat disease RVF, were reported to be already in wide use in Africa.\n\nPhase 2 followed with another joint funding of US$51 million from BMGF (80 percent) and DFID (20 percent). It ran from 2012 to 2017. In commenting on the awarding of the phase 2 grant, the UK International Development Secretary, Andrew Mitchell, explained that, \u201cGALVmed has pioneered work to identify vaccines, medicine and early diagnostic solutions to tackle some of the most devastating livestock diseases that affect poor farmers in the developing world. This new funding from the British taxpayer and from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will ensure that these innovative solutions are produced at scale and that solutions can get to those who need them most, at an affordable price.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last=Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation|title= Gates Foundation and the UK Government award GALVmed additional US$ 51 million|url= http://www.galvmed.org/gates-foundation-and-dfid-award-galvmed-additional-us-51-million}}</ref>\n \nIn view of the progress made during GALVmed phase 1 and 2, BMGF and DFID decided to jointly fund a new programme, Veterinary Innovations Transforming Animal Health and Livelihoods (VITAL) which will run from 2018 to 2022. The VITAL programme aims to make a significant contribution towards transformational change in the smallholder livestock health landscape by developing a portfolio of high impact products and initiating a range of private sector market initiatives operating at scale in the smallholder sector. For the VITAL programme, DFID and BMGF jointly committed to providing US$50 million with DFID contributing 20 percent and BMGF 80 percent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Charity Commission|title= Global Alliance for Livestock Veterinary Medicines (GALVmed)|url= http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/SIR/ENDS06/0001115606_SIR_20130331_E.PDF}}</ref>\n\nIn awarding the VITAL funding, Bill Gates, who is the co-Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, said that \"for over a billion people living in the world\u2019s poorest countries, agriculture and livestock are a lifeline out of poverty.

This integrated, solutions-driven initiative aims to address crucial animal health challenges by creating consistent availability of animal medical resources in hard-to-reach areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. It targets ruminants, such as sheep, goats and cattle, and will further expand to include poultry. Through this project, Boehringer Ingelheim helps smallholder farmers, in Africa, access to veterinary medicines reaffirming its strong social commitment to make a difference to human and animal lives where it is needed.\n\n==Organisation==\nGALVmed is a company limited by guarantee and a registered charity in both Scotland, England and Wales.\nIts head office is located in Edinburgh, Scotland. \nGALVmed has regional offices in New Delhi and Nairobi.\nGALVmed has 31 staff members and long-term consultants in addition to advisors and contracted consultants.

The 12 diseases are:\n\n'''Cattle diseases''':\n* East Coast fever (Theileriosis)\n* Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia\n* Trypanosomosis\n* [[Lumpy skin disease]]\n\n'''Sheep and goats diseases''':\n* Peste des petits ruminants\n* Contagious caprinepleuropneumonia\n* Sheep & goat pox\n* [[Brucellosis]]\n\n'''Pigs diseases''':\n* Porcine cysticercosis (zoonotic)\n* African swine fever\n\n'''Poultry diseases''':\n* Newcastle disease\n\n'''Multi-species diseases''':\n* Rift Valley fever (zoonotic)\n\nTwenty different veterinary products were also actively worked upon at various stages in the exploratory-proof of concept-development-registration-commercialization continuum: 11 vaccines, 4 pharmaceutical and 2 diagnostic products.\n\nUnder the '''VITAL programme''', GALVmed is undertaking two complimentary strands of work, Product Development and Market Development. \n\nThe '''Product Development''' projects include:\n* Small ruminant systemic multivalent vaccine\n* Small ruminant reproductive multivalent vaccine\n* PPR-SGP Combination vaccine\n* CBPP-LSD RVF combination vaccine\n* ND-Gumboro combination vaccine\n* Negatively marked PPR vaccine\n* ND-FP concurrent use vaccine field studies\n* Product Registration Expansion\n* ASF vaccine\n* Animal African Trypanosomosis\n* High Release Titre ND vaccine \n\n'''Market Development''' activities include:\n* Asia initiative \u2013 a manufacturer driven & led enterprise\n* East Africa initiative \u2013 multi manufacturer\n* West Africa initiative \u2013 multi manufacturer\n* West Africa \u2013 a manufacturer-distributor driven & managed entreprise\n* West Africa \u2013 upstream enterprise \n* Sensitisation of R&D products\n* Last Mile project with Boehringer Ingelheim\n\n==Key projects==\n'''Newcastle disease''': One of GALVmed's projects has focused on the prevention of Newcastle disease in the chickens kept by poor women in Nepal. \nGALVmed, in partnership with the NGO Heifer International Nepal, has established a vaccine supply system that has transformed backyard poultry keeping. Whereas previously these women regularly lost 90 percent of their small flocks to the disease, now, thanks to vaccination, they have built up profitable small-scale enterprises. These have not only enabled them to pay their children's school fees and meet medical bills, but have also empowered the women who report that they now enjoy more respect from their husbands.\n \nVaccination is carried out by trained community animal health workers who buy vaccines and offer vaccination services to the women on payment of a small fee. Following a recent assessment of the project, the BMGF concluded that, \u201cThis is possibly the easiest, quickest and most economic way of reaching out to the poor of the world with visible results in helping alleviate poverty.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|last=The Times|title= Farmers take Bill Gates\u2019s \u00a325m tip: care for the animals to beat poverty|url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/scotland/article4307623.ece}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, GALVmed announced it was to bring Newcastle disease vaccination to 100,000 backyard poultry farmers in the Mayurbhanj district of Orissa, India. In partnership with [[Hester Biosciences|Hester Biosciences Limited]], GALVmed will use the thermostable Lasota vaccine for Newcastle disease. Although this vaccine needs to be transported and stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius, at village-level, it can be kept in room temperature for 10 days at 37 degrees Celsius. This means that the 237 local vaccinators will be able to stock up on the vaccine and not need to make frequent trips to the retailer for fresh stocks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Animal Pharm|title= India targeted in Newcastle disease vaccine plan|url= https://www.agra-net.net/agra/animal-pharm/regions/india/india-targeted-in-newcastle-disease-vaccine-plan-467426.htm}}</ref>\n\n'''East Coast fever:''' From the outset a major focus of GALVmed's work has been ECF. GALVmed has invested heavily in providing infrastructure and business and technical support to the Centre for Tick and Tick Borne Diseases in Lilongwe, Malawi. In December 2014, CTTBD became the African Union centre of excellence in ECF vaccine production within Africa when it began production on the Muguga Cocktail vaccine against ECF. The one-shot-for-life vaccine will help protect 25 million cattle across 11 countries. The Muguga Cocktail ECF vaccine was originally developed by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and its predecessor, the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) and the Kenya Agricultural Research institute \u2013 now known as the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO).<ref>{{cite web|last=Animal Pharm|title= Africa's top ECF vaccine facility upgraded|url=https://cttbdlaunch.wordpress.com/}}</ref>\n\n==Key Achievements==\nBy the end of phase two, GALVmed reported the following key achievements<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.galvmed.org/galvmedat10/index.html|title=GALVmed @10 - A decade of protecting livestock, improving human lives|website=www.galvmed.org|access-date=2020-01-27}}</ref>\n\n* 10 products delivered \n* Proof of Concept achieved for 8 products \n* 6,000+ compounds screened, 1 potential trypanocide, several backup candidates for Trypanosomosis\n* 8 products commercialised \n* 1.67 million cattle vaccinated against ECF\n* 170 million ND vaccines sold \n* Over 2.5 million households reached \n* USD$ 167 million estimated value of livestock disease mortalities averted \n* Over 12,400 vaccinators trained\n* EAC MRP system established, 1 product registered, 2 under review\n* FARM Africa Business plan development supported resulting in successful establishment of livestock social enterprise Sidai \n* Manufacturing capability of 8 African laboratories enhanced \n\n==Key partnerships==\nPartnerships are central to GALVmed's approach; it currently has 200 active partnerships.

The contract stipulated that Tottenham would receive 40% of any future transfer profit, in addition to the payments already made. His move was proved to be one of the bargains of the season as Taarabt scored 19 goals in 44 league appearances that season for the West London club. With his unpredictable skill and reputation for never giving the opposition defence an easy 90 minutes, Taarabt went on to win the Championship Player of the Year award and gained a place in the Championship's best XI, which also featured teammate [[Paddy Kenny]].\n\nIn March 2011, Taarabt missed two matches when he returned to France for family matters as one of his cousins had been killed by Algerians. In the international Morocco\u2013Algeria match, Taarabt picked up a booking and was lucky not to be sent off. In the return fixture Morocco manager [[Erik Gerets]] opted to drop Taarabt to the substitutes' bench. Taarabt decided to not turn up to the international fixture and vowed to never play for his country again. However, several months later, Taarabt wanted to play for Morocco again, which Gerets reluctantly allowed, but said that if Taarabt acted irrationally again, he would not play for his country while he was in charge.\n\nSome notable moments during the season were against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] (an away 2\u20132 draw), where Taarabt picked up a brace, scoring a wonder goal in the process. During the home match against the same opposition, Taarabt scored the winner which took QPR back to the top of the Championship.\n\n====2011\u201312 season====\n[[File:Adel Taarabt.jpg|thumb|upright|Taarabt playing for [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in 2011]]\n\nThe [[2011\u201312 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season|2011\u201312 season]] marked Taarabt's first real foray into the Premier League, for although having been featured in English football's highest tier as a Tottenham player, he had never made a breakthrough into the Spurs' starting XI. The start of the season held much optimism for both QPR and Taarabt, yet this soon gave way to speculation that he would move away, and his name was associated with the likes of [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and [[S.S.C.

The contract stipulated that Tottenham would receive 40% of any future transfer profit, in addition to the payments already made. His move was proved to be one of the bargains of the season as Taarabt scored 19 goals in 44 league appearances that season for the West London club. With his unpredictable skill and reputation for never giving the opposition defence an easy 90 minutes, Taarabt went on to win the Championship Player of the Year award and gained a place in the Championship's best XI, which also featured teammate [[Paddy Kenny]].\n\nIn March 2011, Taarabt missed two matches when he returned to France for family matters as one of his cousins had been killed by Algerians. In the international Morocco\u2013Algeria match, Taarabt picked up a booking and was lucky not to be sent off. In the return fixture Morocco manager [[Erik Gerets]] opted to drop Taarabt to the substitutes' bench. Taarabt decided to not turn up to the international fixture and vowed to never play for his country again. However, several months later, Taarabt wanted to play for Morocco again, which Gerets reluctantly allowed, but said that if Taarabt acted irrationally again, he would not play for his country while he was in charge.\n\nSome notable moments during the season were against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] (an away 2\u20132 draw), where Taarabt picked up a brace, scoring a wonder goal in the process. During the home match against the same opposition, Taarabt scored the winner which took QPR back to the top of the Championship.\n\n====2011\u201312 season====\n[[File:Adel Taarabt.jpg|thumb|upright|Taarabt playing for [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in 2011]]\n\nThe [[2011\u201312 Queens Park Rangers F.C. season|2011\u201312 season]] marked Taarabt's first real foray into the Premier League, for although having been featured in English football's highest tier as a Tottenham player, he had never made a breakthrough into the Spurs' starting XI. The start of the season held much optimism for both QPR and Taarabt, yet this soon gave way to speculation that he would move away, and his name was associated with the likes of [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and [[S.S.C.

It features the [[Marvel Comics]] characters ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' in a side-scrolling [[Beat 'em up|brawling]] and [[Shoot 'em up|shooting]] adventure to defeat the evil [[Red Skull]]. The game received ports for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Gear]]. A different Data East game was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe Red Skull has assembled an army of supervillains and other henchmen in a plot to take over the world. Along with battling generic enemies, players also face [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], the [[Living Laser]], [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], [[Sentinel (comics)|a Sentinel]], [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], [[Ultron]], the assassin [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], and finally the Red Skull himself.\n\nPlayers can choose to play as one of four members of the Avengers: [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. Each character can fight hand-to-hand; throw select items when on the ground; and use a ranged special attack, either a projectile weapon (Captain America's shield and Hawkeye's arrows) or an energy beam (Iron Man and Vision), known as that character's \"Avenger Attack.\" During a jump, Captain America and Hawkeye can attack with a flying kick, while Iron Man and Vision instead attack by firing their energy beams at a 45 degree angle. Other Avengers, including the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Wonder Man]], and [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], appear when special power-ups are collected, allowing those characters to temporarily assist the players' characters.\n\nMost game levels feature side-scrolling fighting, with free movement as in traditional arcade brawlers. Occasionally, players take flight for side-scrolling flying & shooting sequences; Iron Man and Vision fly on their own, while Captain America and Hawkeye use flying machines.\n\n==Versions==\n[[Image:Captain America and The Avengers (Arcade) gameplay.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of the 1991 two-player arcade version.]]\nThe original arcade game was sold in two forms. One version allowed four players to play simultaneously, with each player position controlling a specific character. An alternate version featured two-player gameplay, with players able to select from any of the available four characters.\n\n==Ports and related releases==\nData East released a home version of the game in North America for the [[Sega Genesis]] co-developed with ISCO/Opera House.<ref>http://www.isco-inc.co.jp/Web_izen/game_etc.htm</ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20161220184805/http://opera-house.co.jp/works.html</ref> This version was published in Europe by [[Sega]] for the [[Mega Drive]]. The game was later licensed to [[Mindscape (company)|Mindscape]], who released its own ports of the arcade game for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Gear]]. The versions published by Mindscape were developed by [[Realtime Associates]].<ref name=\"RealTime\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rtassoc.com/pastprojects.html |title=Realtime Associates - Past Projects |accessdate=2011-04-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525031458/http://www.rtassoc.com/pastprojects.html |archivedate=2011-05-25 }}</ref>\n\nData East also released a different [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game with the same title. The NES version is a side-scrolling action platform game.

It features the [[Marvel Comics]] characters ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' in a side-scrolling [[Beat 'em up|brawling]] and [[Shoot 'em up|shooting]] adventure to defeat the evil [[Red Skull]]. The game received ports for the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], [[Game Boy]] and [[Game Gear]]. A different Data East game was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe Red Skull has assembled an army of supervillains and other henchmen in a plot to take over the world. Along with battling generic enemies, players also face [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], the [[Living Laser]], [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]], [[Sentinel (comics)|a Sentinel]], [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]], the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], [[Juggernaut (comics)| Juggernaut]], [[Ultron]], the assassin [[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], and finally the Red Skull himself.\n\nPlayers can choose to play as one of four members of the Avengers: [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]], and [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. Each character can fight hand-to-hand; throw select items when on the ground; and use a ranged special attack, either a projectile weapon (Captain America's shield and Hawkeye's arrows) or an energy beam (Iron Man and Vision), known as that character's \"Avenger Attack.\" During a jump, Captain America and Hawkeye can attack with a flying kick, while Iron Man and Vision instead attack by firing their energy beams at a 45 degree angle. Other Avengers, including the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Wonder Man]], and [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], appear when special power-ups are collected, allowing those characters to temporarily assist the players' characters.\n\nMost game levels feature side-scrolling fighting, with free movement as in traditional arcade brawlers. Occasionally, players take flight for side-scrolling flying & shooting sequences; Iron Man and Vision fly on their own, while Captain America and Hawkeye use flying machines.\n\n==Versions==\n[[Image:Captain America and The Avengers (Arcade) gameplay.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of the 1991 two-player arcade version.]]\nThe original arcade game was sold in two forms. One version allowed four players to play simultaneously, with each player position controlling a specific character. An alternate version featured two-player gameplay, with players able to select from any of the available four characters.\n\n==Ports and related releases==\nData East released a home version of the game in North America for the [[Sega Genesis]] co-developed with ISCO/Opera House. <ref> http://www.isco-inc.co.jp/Web_izen/game_etc.htm </ref><ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20161220184805/http://opera-house.co.jp/works.html </ref> This version was published in Europe by [[Sega]] for the [[Mega Drive]].

It was held in [[Marrakech]], Morocco, on 7\u201318 November 2016. The conference incorporated the twenty-second [[Conference of the parties|Conference of the Parties]] ('''COP22'''), the twelfth meeting of the parties for the [[Kyoto Protocol]] ('''CMP12'''), and the first meeting of the parties for the [[Paris Agreement]] ('''CMA1'''). The purpose of the conference was to discuss and implement plans about combatting climate change and to \"[demonstrate] to the world that the implementation of the Paris Agreement is underway\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/meetings/marrakech_nov_2016/meeting/9567.php|title=Marrakech Climate Change Conference - November 2016|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-21}}</ref> Participants work together to come up with global solutions to [[climate change]].\n\nThe conference was presided over by [[Salaheddine Mezouar]], the Moroccan [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Morocco)|Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maghrebemergent.com/actualite/maghrebine/54192-maroc-les-preparatifs-vont-bon-train-a-marrakech-pour-la-tenue-de-la-cop22-en-2016.html|title=Maroc - Les pr\u00e9paratifs vont bon train \u00e0 Marrakech pour la tenue de la COP22 en 2016 - Maghreb Emergent|last=Xinhua|website=www.maghrebemergent.com|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref> Approximately 20,000 participants were expected to attend.\n\nOn 2 May 2016, events firm GL Events signed the service contract. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] also lent its support to the preparation for COP 22\".\n\n==Background==\n=== United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ===\nThe participants in the conference are members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ('''UNFCCC'''). The aim of this convention is to prevent \"dangerous human interference with the climate system\".<ref name=\"Change\">{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/items/6036.php|title=Introduction to the Convention|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> It is closely related to both the [[UN Convention on Biological Diversity]] and the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]]; all three are considered 'Rio Conventions' adopted at the [[Earth Summit|Rio Earth Summit]] in 1992. There are seven steps that the UNFCCC lists as a \"summary of the convention\".<ref name=\"Change\"/>\n# The problem of climate change is recognized as a threat to human safety.\n# [[Greenhouse gas]] emissions, especially in industrialized countries, must be reduced and countries are pressured to reduce emissions.\n# Advanced countries must take action to reduce emissions and lead the way for developing nations.\n# Advanced countries will help developing nations by providing financial and technological support.\n# Both advanced and developing countries submit reports on climate change policies and greenhouse gas emissions.\n# In developing countries, clean growth is emphasized as to limit the augmentation of greenhouse gas emissions while the nation industrializes.\n# In order to increase quality of life in the presence of climate change, the convention will address and adapt to adverse effects of climate change when necessary.\n\n=== The Kyoto Protocol ===\nThe Marrakech Conference is a continuation of regular global summits organised by United Nations following the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. The Kyoto Protocol was written in 1997 at COP3, but was not officially adopted until 16 February 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/background/items/2879.php|title=A Summary of the Kyoto Protocol|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> It was in effect from 2008 to 2012. It implemented strict regulations to ensure global emission reduction. There are three main mechanisms that a country can utilize to help reduce emissions: international emissions trading, clean development mechanisms, and joint implementation.<ref name=\"unfccc.int\">{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php|title=Kyoto Protocol|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref>\n\nThe Protocol is also meant to assist countries in adapting to the conditions of climate change. Additionally, the [[UN Climate Change Secretariat]] receives reports from Parties, verifies transactions, and holds Parties accountable. The UNFCC considers the Kyoto Protocol a \"first step\" to climate change resistance.<ref name=\"unfccc.int\"/>\n\n=== The Paris Agreement ===\nThe [[Paris Agreement]] aims to prevent the rise of global temperatures. This is regulated by reports sent in by the Parties, meant to increase transparency of actions taken by both developing nations and advanced ones. It also has measures to increase countries' ability to adapt to conditions of climate change. The means of change that a country can take are called \"nationally determined contributions\". '''NDC'''<nowiki/>'s are essentially the efforts that each country will take to reduce their emissions. The period of effect for this agreement began on 4 November 2016. So far, it has been ratified by 132 out of 197 Parties at the convention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php|title=The Paris Agreement - main page|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Conference of the Parties (UNCCD)|Preceding COPs]] ===\n==== 2009: Copenhagen (COP15) ====\nThe Copenhagen Conference was intended to follow on from Kyoto, and culminated in the Copenhagen Accord, a 3-page text laying out common international intentions regarding climate change (reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, limiting global warming to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C and providing 30 billion dollars for 2010\u20132012). Despite these goals, the conference was generally considered a failure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8426835.stm|title=Why did Copenhagen fail to deliver a climate deal?|date=22 December 2009|publisher=BBC News|access-date=3 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal|title=Low targets, goals dropped: Copenhagen ends in failure|last=Vidal|first=John|date=2009-12-18|last2=Stratton|first2=Allegra|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Goldenberg|first3=Suzanne|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==== 2011: Durban (COP17) ====\nThe aim of the Durban Conference was to start negotiations from scratch in order to prepare the path for future negotiations. The Ah Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action was created to \"close the ambition gap\" that existed between greenhouse-gas emission commitments made by nations and the aim to keep climate change below an increase of 2&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/bodies/body/6645.php|title=Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==== 2014: Lima (COP20) ====\nThe priority of the Lima Conference was to redouble efforts to keep to the aim of keeping climate change under an increase of 2&nbsp;\u00b0C between the present day and 2100. The conference opened with a preparatory document on a future COP21 agreement in Paris and by adopting a 37-page text.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conference of the parties|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=Lima|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== 2015: Paris (COP21) ====\nThe 195 countries participating in the conference adopted the first worldwide climate agreement, a binding treaty that aims to limit climate change to a temperature increase of under 2&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris/index_en.htm|title=Paris Agreement - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref>\n\n== Attendees ==\nThe convention's attendees can be sorted into one of three categories: parties, observers, or members of the press/media.\n\n=== Parties ===\nThere are three distinct groups that a nation can be placed in if they are considered a \"party\". These are [[Annex I]], [[Annex II]], and [[Non-Annex I Parties|Non-Annex I]]. The organization of parties decides the level of participation of each country. It determines if the country is required to give financial aid to others, how often they must send reports, and the strictness of regulations in their country. The Annex I title refers to industrialized countries involved in either the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] ('''OECD''') in 1992 or countries in economic transition ('''EIT'''). Annex II refers to countries in OECD but not EIT. These parties are required to help less advanced countries financially. They are also expected to take extra measures to transition to climate friendly technologies in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Non-Annex countries are developing and particularly vulnerable to climate change due to location, economic situations, or other issues institutionalized into the country. Another title is \"least developed countries\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/parties_and_observers/items/2704.php|title=Parties & Observers|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> This indicates that the nation is limited in their ability to respond to climate change issues. This label indicates to other parties the extra level of support necessary.\n\n=== Observers ===\nObserver organizations include the United Nations Systems and its specialized agencies, inter-governmental organizations ('''IGOs'''), and non-governmental organizations ('''NGOs''').<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/parties_and_observers/observer_organizations/items/9524.php|title=Observer organizations and civil society|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> Observer organizations must apply and be accepted by the COP to send representatives to any meeting or presentation related to the UNFCCC.

However, each year a different theme is chosen and focused on. The twenty-second session dealt mainly with water management and decarbonizing energy supplies.<ref name=\"cop22.org|title=COP22\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cop22.org|title=COP22 Marrakech Morocco - Sustainable Innovation Forum in partnership with United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) {{!}} COP22 Marrakech|website=www.cop22.org|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> COP22 took place on 14 and 15 November during the UNFCCC in Marrakech.<ref name=\"cop22.org|title=COP22\"/> The ways in which the [[Paris Agreement]] will be applied, as well as the agenda for negotiations, were on the agenda for COP22. [[Nik Gowing]], known as a British journalist, chaired the event.\n\n=== African Dimension to COP22 ===\nOn the margins of COP22, a summit involving \"around 30 African heads of state\" took place on 16 November 2016 in Marrakesh. This summit focused primarily on climate negotiations, in the backdrop of Africa being the part of the world that is the most threatened by global warming. On a more local note, the city of Marrakesh also took the opportunity to create for itself a greener image; for example, it has provided 300 bicycles for public use as part of a municipal [[Bicycle-sharing system|bicycle-sharing]] scheme.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://aujourdhui.ma/economie/cop22-300-velos-libre-service-a-marrakech|title=Cop22: 300 v\u00e9los libre-service \u00e0 Marrakech|newspaper=Aujourd'hui le Maroc|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Presentation of [[SuRe]] \u2013 The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure ===\nOn 14 November, the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) presented the newly launched [[SuRe]] \u2013 The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure at the Climate Summit for Local and Regional Leaders.<ref>http://www.gib-foundation.org/news/</ref>\nGIB participated in a dialogue on \"financing the sustainable transition of territories\" to contribute to the Marrakech Roadmap for Action definition.\n\n=== 14 November ===\n==== Water Management and Conservation Forum ====\nDetailed issues relating to water transportation, infrastructure in the context of water storage, [[sustainable distribution]], innovation for conservation, and accelerating efforts for new technologies.

It was held in [[Marrakech]], Morocco, on 7\u201318 November 2016. The conference incorporated the twenty-second [[Conference of the parties|Conference of the Parties]] ('''COP22'''), the twelfth meeting of the parties for the [[Kyoto Protocol]] ('''CMP12'''), and the first meeting of the parties for the [[Paris Agreement]] ('''CMA1'''). The purpose of the conference was to discuss and implement plans about combatting climate change and to \"[demonstrate] to the world that the implementation of the Paris Agreement is underway\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/meetings/marrakech_nov_2016/meeting/9567.php|title=Marrakech Climate Change Conference - November 2016|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-21}}</ref> Participants work together to come up with global solutions to [[climate change]].\n\nThe conference was presided over by [[Salaheddine Mezouar]], the Moroccan [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Morocco)|Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maghrebemergent.com/actualite/maghrebine/54192-maroc-les-preparatifs-vont-bon-train-a-marrakech-pour-la-tenue-de-la-cop22-en-2016.html|title=Maroc - Les pr\u00e9paratifs vont bon train \u00e0 Marrakech pour la tenue de la COP22 en 2016 - Maghreb Emergent|last=Xinhua|website=www.maghrebemergent.com|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref> Approximately 20,000 participants were expected to attend.\n\nOn 2 May 2016, events firm GL Events signed the service contract. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] also lent its support to the preparation for COP 22\".\n\n==Background==\n=== United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ===\nThe participants in the conference are members of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ('''UNFCCC'''). The aim of this convention is to prevent \"dangerous human interference with the climate system\".<ref name=\"Change\">{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/items/6036.php|title=Introduction to the Convention|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> It is closely related to both the [[UN Convention on Biological Diversity]] and the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]]; all three are considered 'Rio Conventions' adopted at the [[Earth Summit|Rio Earth Summit]] in 1992. There are seven steps that the UNFCCC lists as a \"summary of the convention\".<ref name=\"Change\"/>\n# The problem of climate change is recognized as a threat to human safety.\n# [[Greenhouse gas]] emissions, especially in industrialized countries, must be reduced and countries are pressured to reduce emissions.\n# Advanced countries must take action to reduce emissions and lead the way for developing nations.\n# Advanced countries will help developing nations by providing financial and technological support.\n# Both advanced and developing countries submit reports on climate change policies and greenhouse gas emissions.\n# In developing countries, clean growth is emphasized as to limit the augmentation of greenhouse gas emissions while the nation industrializes.\n# In order to increase quality of life in the presence of climate change, the convention will address and adapt to adverse effects of climate change when necessary.\n\n=== The Kyoto Protocol ===\nThe Marrakech Conference is a continuation of regular global summits organised by United Nations following the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. The Kyoto Protocol was written in 1997 at COP3, but was not officially adopted until 16 February 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/background/items/2879.php|title=A Summary of the Kyoto Protocol|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> It was in effect from 2008 to 2012. It implemented strict regulations to ensure global emission reduction. There are three main mechanisms that a country can utilize to help reduce emissions: international emissions trading, clean development mechanisms, and joint implementation.<ref name=\"unfccc.int\">{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/items/2830.php|title=Kyoto Protocol|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref>\n\nThe Protocol is also meant to assist countries in adapting to the conditions of climate change. Additionally, the [[UN Climate Change Secretariat]] receives reports from Parties, verifies transactions, and holds Parties accountable. The UNFCC considers the Kyoto Protocol a \"first step\" to climate change resistance.<ref name=\"unfccc.int\"/>\n\n=== The Paris Agreement ===\nThe [[Paris Agreement]] aims to prevent the rise of global temperatures. This is regulated by reports sent in by the Parties, meant to increase transparency of actions taken by both developing nations and advanced ones. It also has measures to increase countries' ability to adapt to conditions of climate change. The means of change that a country can take are called \"nationally determined contributions\". '''NDC'''<nowiki/>'s are essentially the efforts that each country will take to reduce their emissions. The period of effect for this agreement began on 4 November 2016. So far, it has been ratified by 132 out of 197 Parties at the convention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9485.php|title=The Paris Agreement - main page|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref>\n\n=== [[Conference of the Parties (UNCCD)|Preceding COPs]] ===\n==== 2009: Copenhagen (COP15) ====\nThe Copenhagen Conference was intended to follow on from Kyoto, and culminated in the Copenhagen Accord, a 3-page text laying out common international intentions regarding climate change (reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, limiting global warming to 2&nbsp;\u00b0C and providing 30 billion dollars for 2010\u20132012).

The Ah Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action was created to \"close the ambition gap\" that existed between greenhouse-gas emission commitments made by nations and the aim to keep climate change below an increase of 2&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/bodies/body/6645.php|title=Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==== 2014: Lima (COP20) ====\nThe priority of the Lima Conference was to redouble efforts to keep to the aim of keeping climate change under an increase of 2&nbsp;\u00b0C between the present day and 2100. The conference opened with a preparatory document on a future COP21 agreement in Paris and by adopting a 37-page text.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conference of the parties|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=|location=Lima|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== 2015: Paris (COP21) ====\nThe 195 countries participating in the conference adopted the first worldwide climate agreement, a binding treaty that aims to limit climate change to a temperature increase of under 2&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/international/negotiations/paris/index_en.htm|title=Paris Agreement - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref>\n\n== Attendees ==\nThe convention's attendees can be sorted into one of three categories: parties, observers, or members of the press/media.\n\n=== Parties ===\nThere are three distinct groups that a nation can be placed in if they are considered a \"party\". These are [[Annex I]], [[Annex II]], and [[Non-Annex I Parties|Non-Annex I]]. The organization of parties decides the level of participation of each country. It determines if the country is required to give financial aid to others, how often they must send reports, and the strictness of regulations in their country. The Annex I title refers to industrialized countries involved in either the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] ('''OECD''') in 1992 or countries in economic transition ('''EIT'''). Annex II refers to countries in OECD but not EIT. These parties are required to help less advanced countries financially. They are also expected to take extra measures to transition to climate friendly technologies in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Non-Annex countries are developing and particularly vulnerable to climate change due to location, economic situations, or other issues institutionalized into the country. Another title is \"least developed countries\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/parties_and_observers/items/2704.php|title=Parties & Observers|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> This indicates that the nation is limited in their ability to respond to climate change issues. This label indicates to other parties the extra level of support necessary.\n\n=== Observers ===\nObserver organizations include the United Nations Systems and its specialized agencies, inter-governmental organizations ('''IGOs'''), and non-governmental organizations ('''NGOs''').<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/parties_and_observers/observer_organizations/items/9524.php|title=Observer organizations and civil society|last=Change|first=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> Observer organizations must apply and be accepted by the COP to send representatives to any meeting or presentation related to the UNFCCC. NGOs can be businesses, labor unions, research or academic institutes, native populations, gender-affiliated groups, youth groups, environmental activists, farmers, and agriculturists.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Around 2,000 NGOs and 100 IGOs were admitted to the 2016 conference.

However, each year a different theme is chosen and focused on. The twenty-second session dealt mainly with water management and decarbonizing energy supplies.<ref name=\"cop22.org|title=COP22\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cop22.org|title=COP22 Marrakech Morocco - Sustainable Innovation Forum in partnership with United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) {{!}} COP22 Marrakech|website=www.cop22.org|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref> COP22 took place on 14 and 15 November during the UNFCCC in Marrakech.<ref name=\"cop22.org|title=COP22\"/> The ways in which the [[Paris Agreement]] will be applied, as well as the agenda for negotiations, were on the agenda for COP22. [[Nik Gowing]], known as a British journalist, chaired the event.\n\n=== African Dimension to COP22 ===\nOn the margins of COP22, a summit involving \"around 30 African heads of state\" took place on 16 November 2016 in Marrakesh. This summit focused primarily on climate negotiations, in the backdrop of Africa being the part of the world that is the most threatened by global warming. On a more local note, the city of Marrakesh also took the opportunity to create for itself a greener image; for example, it has provided 300 bicycles for public use as part of a municipal [[Bicycle-sharing system|bicycle-sharing]] scheme.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://aujourdhui.ma/economie/cop22-300-velos-libre-service-a-marrakech|title=Cop22: 300 v\u00e9los libre-service \u00e0 Marrakech|newspaper=Aujourd'hui le Maroc|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Presentation of [[SuRe]] \u2013 The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure ===\nOn 14 November, the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) presented the newly launched [[SuRe]] \u2013 The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure at the Climate Summit for Local and Regional Leaders.<ref>http://www.gib-foundation.org/news/</ref>\nGIB participated in a dialogue on \"financing the sustainable transition of territories\" to contribute to the Marrakech Roadmap for Action definition.\n\n=== 14 November ===\n==== Water Management and Conservation Forum ====\nDetailed issues relating to water transportation, infrastructure in the context of water storage, sustainable distribution, innovation for conservation, and accelerating efforts for new technologies.

Three different versions were developed to suit three different platform capabilities, each with a markedly different gameplay. The [[Amiga]]/[[Atari ST]] version was released in 1991, as was the [[ZX Spectrum]]/[[Amstrad CPC]] version, while the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version was released in 1992.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===NES version===\n\nThe NES version of the game has five levels, each of which are divided into two different types of stages. The first stage involves controlling the international teen heroes (Planeteers) flying their Eco-Jet to an enemy fortress, while trying to avoid the instant death that occurs by touching any of the scenery or getting hit by the various projectiles or birds. The second stage involves controlling [[Captain Planet]] himself as he fights his way to an ecovillain from the TV series.\n\nThe NES version features levels set in the [[Yellowstone National Park]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Africa]] and [[Antarctica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/nes/587172-captain-planet-and-the-planeteers/faqs/37547|title=Captain Planet and the Planeteers|publisher=Gamefaqs|language=English|date=January 2005|accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Amiga/Atari ST version===\n\nThe Amiga/Atari version has five stages, one for each Planeteer, and a final stage in which Captain Planet could be controlled.

{"title_page": "Ergonomics in Canada", "text_new": "This article describes the origins of some of the institutions and agencies contributing to the development and practice of '''ergonomics in Canada'''.\n\nErgonomics in Canada, as in other countries, found its genesis in military procurement. Following [[World War II|the Second World War]], military scientists at the Defence Research Board Toronto recognised the basic tenet of ergonomics\u2013that operators (in this case servicemen and women) work more safely and more effectively when the design of the work situation takes account of their anatomical, physiological and psychological characteristics&nbsp;\u2013 and adopted it as a significant component of their work.<ref group=fn>For a brief history of ergonomics at DCIEM, see Sharon McFadden, Communiqu\u00e9 1989, 19(6):1-3 (Calgary, Alberta: ACE).</ref> In due course, the Defence and Civil Institute of [[Environmental medicine|Environmental Medicine]] (DCIEM), as this agency was oddly renamed, became the birthplace, in 1968, of the [[Human factors|Human Factors]] Association of Canada (HFAC), the Canadian organisation affiliated to the [[International Ergonomics Association]].<ref>{{citation |title=The Encyclopedia Americana |volume=14 |page=545}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984 the Association adopted the name Human Factors Association of Canada/Association canadienne d\u2019ergonomie. In this year also it entered the international scene by sponsoring the International Conference on Occupational Ergonomics in Toronto. In 1999 it changed its name once more, this time to the Association of Canadian Ergonomists/Association canadienne d\u2019ergonomie (ACE).\n\nThe twenty-nine founding members of the original organisation<ref group=fn>A photograph of the founding members was published in Communiqu\u00e9 1982, 12(2):2, together with the minutes of the founding meeting.</ref> were mostly military or ex-military persons or functionaries of other government departments. A few were academics; only two were women. In its early days ACE (or HFAC, as it then was) did not make many waves. Members met at least once a year to present papers to each other, but it did not engage seriously in questions of academic and professional status and development. The prevailing mode changed in 1981 when members were persuaded to forsake the [[Muskoka Lakes]] in order to hold the annual conference in Toronto. Ergonomists from places outside [[southern Ontario]] were now able to find the venue and the organisation began its expansion.\n\nApart from providing a birthplace for ACE, DCIEM also provided its original name. In establishing DCIEM, the Department of [[Defense (military)|National Defence]] had \"recognized the importance of human factors\", and DCIEM claimed \"the human factors of command systems\" as one of its areas of competence. In 1968, prevailing opinion in North America was that the term human factors correctly described the domain of interest and did so more appropriately than the term ergonomics. The new association was therefore named accordingly.<ref group=fn>For an account of the first meeting, see Leslie Innes, Communiqu\u00e9 1988 18(3):1-3.</ref> It thrived for many years with that name but whether the decision impeded, in certain respects, the development of ergonomics in Canada remains questionable.\n\nIn 1980 the Government of Quebec established in Montreal the Institut de recherche en sant\u00e9 et en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de travail (IRSST) to undertake research aimed at promoting [[Occupational safety and health|occupational health and safety]]. From its inception, ergonomics research constituted a significant part of the activity of IRSST, but unlike that of DCIEM, this research was wholly directed to industrial objectives as distinct from what were the military objectives of the latter. IRSST was also distinctive in having representatives of employer organisations and [[trade union]]s sitting on its administrative board. In other respects, the two agencies were alike in being government sponsored and, for the most part, government funded, and in giving considerable support to the professional and scientific activities of ACE.<ref group=fn>For an account of the early development of ergonomics in Quebec, see Denis Gigu\u00e8re and Robert Gilbert, L'Ergonomie au Qu\u00e9bec, paper presented at the 20th Annual Conference of ACE (HFAC/ACE) 1987.</ref>\n\nIn 1984 the [[National Research Council of Canada]] established the Associate Committee for the [[Industrial applicability|Industrial Application]] of Ergonomics. Drawing members from government agencies, the universities, industry and commerce, and trade unions, the Committee was mandated to promote the application of ergonomics to industry on the assumption that this either was not, or was inadequately, being done already. Committee members set out across Canada to bring the message to workers, managers and employers, with diverse results. In one city two hundred persons attended a one-day workshop sponsored by the Committee while in another barely a dozen turned up. In these workshops the speakers endeavoured to stress the broad scope of ergonomics, pointing out that ergonomics was pertinent not only to occupational health and safety but also to efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nThe Associate Committee sponsored surveys and seminars implicating government occupational health and safety agencies, ergonomics teachers, trade unions and ACE and successfully raised awareness of the issues. It tried equally to implicate industrialists and engineers but with mixed results (although [[Bell-Northern Research|Bell Northern Research]] at this time employed the biggest single group of ergonomists in Canada, working on the design of its [[Product (business)|consumer products]]). The Committee succeeded in co-sponsoring (with ACE) the appointment of an industry [[technical advisor]] by the NRC Industrial Research Assistance Program but failed to persuade the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to establish a grants committee for ergonomics. As a legacy, the Committee left a series of useful publications.<ref group=fn>The publications of the Associate Committee include Obstacles to the occupational applications of ergonomics 1986, Education for ergonomics 1986, Ergonomics at work 1988, The role of ergonomics in implementing the provisions of occupational health and safety legislation 1989, Proceedings of the national workshop on education and ergonomics 1989, and The role of ergonomics in trade union activity 1990.

Following [[World War II|the Second World War]], military scientists at the Defence Research Board Toronto recognised the basic tenet of ergonomics\u2013that operators (in this case servicemen and women) work more safely and more effectively when the design of the work situation takes account of their anatomical, physiological and psychological characteristics&nbsp;\u2013 and adopted it as a significant component of their work.<ref group=fn>For a brief history of ergonomics at DCIEM, see Sharon McFadden, Communiqu\u00e9 1989, 19(6):1-3 (Calgary, Alberta: ACE).</ref> In due course, the Defence and Civil Institute of [[Environmental medicine|Environmental Medicine]] (DCIEM), as this agency was oddly renamed, became the birthplace, in 1968, of the [[Human factors|Human Factors]] Association of Canada (HFAC), the Canadian organisation affiliated to the [[International Ergonomics Association]].<ref>{{citation |title=The Encyclopedia Americana |volume=14 |page=545}}</ref>\n\nIn 1984 the Association adopted the name Human Factors Association of Canada/Association canadienne d\u2019ergonomie. In this year also it entered the international scene by sponsoring the International Conference on Occupational Ergonomics in Toronto. In 1999 it changed its name once more, this time to the Association of Canadian Ergonomists/Association canadienne d\u2019ergonomie (ACE).\n\nThe twenty-nine founding members of the original organisation<ref group=fn>A photograph of the founding members was published in Communiqu\u00e9 1982, 12(2):2, together with the minutes of the founding meeting.</ref> were mostly military or ex-military persons or functionaries of other government departments. A few were academics; only two were women. In its early days ACE (or HFAC, as it then was) did not make many waves. Members met at least once a year to present papers to each other, but it did not engage seriously in questions of academic and professional status and development. The prevailing mode changed in 1981 when members were persuaded to forsake the [[Muskoka Lakes]] in order to hold the annual conference in Toronto. Ergonomists from places outside [[southern Ontario]] were now able to find the venue and the organisation began its expansion.\n\nApart from providing a birthplace for ACE, DCIEM also provided its original name. In establishing DCIEM, the Department of [[Defense (military)|National Defence]] had \"recognized the importance of human factors\", and DCIEM claimed \"the human factors of command systems\" as one of its areas of competence. In 1968, prevailing opinion in North America was that the term human factors correctly described the domain of interest and did so more appropriately than the term ergonomics. The new association was therefore named accordingly.<ref group=fn>For an account of the first meeting, see Leslie Innes, Communiqu\u00e9 1988 18(3):1-3.</ref> It thrived for many years with that name but whether the decision impeded, in certain respects, the development of ergonomics in Canada remains questionable.\n\nIn 1980 the Government of Quebec established in Montreal the Institut de recherche en sant\u00e9 et en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de travail (IRSST) to undertake research aimed at promoting [[Occupational safety and health|occupational health and safety]]. From its inception, ergonomics research constituted a significant part of the activity of IRSST, but unlike that of DCIEM, this research was wholly directed to industrial objectives as distinct from what were the military objectives of the latter. IRSST was also distinctive in having representatives of employer organisations and [[trade union]]s sitting on its administrative board. In other respects, the two agencies were alike in being government sponsored and, for the most part, government funded, and in giving considerable support to the professional and scientific activities of ACE.<ref group=fn>For an account of the early development of ergonomics in Quebec, see Denis Gigu\u00e8re and Robert Gilbert, L'Ergonomie au Qu\u00e9bec, paper presented at the 20th Annual Conference of ACE (HFAC/ACE) 1987.</ref>\n\nIn 1984 the [[National Research Council of Canada]] established the Associate Committee for the [[Industrial applicability|Industrial Application]] of Ergonomics. Drawing members from government agencies, the universities, industry and commerce, and trade unions, the Committee was mandated to promote the application of ergonomics to industry on the assumption that this either was not, or was inadequately, being done already. Committee members set out across Canada to bring the message to workers, managers and employers, with diverse results. In one city two hundred persons attended a one-day workshop sponsored by the Committee while in another barely a dozen turned up. In these workshops the speakers endeavoured to stress the broad scope of ergonomics, pointing out that ergonomics was pertinent not only to occupational health and safety but also to efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nThe Associate Committee sponsored surveys and seminars implicating government occupational health and safety agencies, ergonomics teachers, trade unions and ACE and successfully raised awareness of the issues. It tried equally to implicate industrialists and engineers but with mixed results (although [[Bell-Northern Research|Bell Northern Research]] at this time employed the biggest single group of ergonomists in Canada, working on the design of its [[Product (business)|consumer products]]). The Committee succeeded in co-sponsoring (with ACE) the appointment of an industry [[technical advisor]] by the NRC Industrial Research Assistance Program but failed to persuade the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to establish a grants committee for ergonomics. As a legacy, the Committee left a series of useful publications.<ref group=fn>The publications of the Associate Committee include Obstacles to the occupational applications of ergonomics 1986, Education for ergonomics 1986, Ergonomics at work 1988, The role of ergonomics in implementing the provisions of occupational health and safety legislation 1989, Proceedings of the national workshop on education and ergonomics 1989, and The role of ergonomics in trade union activity 1990.
