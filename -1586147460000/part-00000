The format prior to the merger with Ha! included several original and unconventional programs such as ''Onion World'' with [[Rich Hall]] and ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', as well as laid-back variety/talk shows hosted by comedians, including ''The Sweet Life'' with [[Rachel Sweet]], ''[[Night After Night with Allan Havey]]'', ''[[Sports Monster]]'', and ''[[The Higgins Boys and Gruber]]'', the latter of whom performed sketches in between showings of vintage television series like ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'', ''[[Clutch Cargo]]'', and ''[[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp]]''.\n\nThe standard format for The Comedy Channel's shows usually involved the various hosts introducing clips culled from the acts of stand-up comedians as well as classic comedies of the 1970s and 1980s, such as ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Kentucky Fried Movie]]'', presented in a style similar to music videos. In the early days, certain hours of the day when clips were shown without \"host segments\" were dubbed ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]''. In 1990, hosts under this title, [[Jon Stewart]] and [[Patty Rosborough]], were introduced. Comedian [[Marc Maron]] also hosted the series.\n\nWhile The Comedy Channel broadcast mostly low-budget original programming,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/01/the-origin-and-early-programs-of-comedy-central |title=The Origin and Early Programs of Comedy Central |author=Boone, Brian |date=January 12, 2012 |work=Splitsider |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315124954/http://splitsider.com/2012/01/the-origin-and-early-programs-of-comedy-central |archive-date=March 15, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Ha!'s schedule featured sitcom and sketch comedy reruns (many of which had been previously licensed for sister network [[Nick at Nite]]) as well as complete 90-minute reruns of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' from the sixth through 16th seasons.\n\nAfter two years of limited distribution, the two channels merged into one, relaunching on [[April Fools' Day|April 1]], 1991 as CTV: The Comedy Network; it later changed its name to Comedy Central on June 1, 1991<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fredalan.org/post/48928291883/the-naming-of-comedy-central|title=The naming of Comedy Central.|first=Peter|last=Vidani|publisher=}}</ref> to prevent issues with the [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] broadcast television network [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], which would eventually be its Canadian content partner through [[The Comedy Network]] when that channel started operations six years later.

Except for the cult favorite ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', the channel had a relatively small viewership. A notable early success was ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' with [[Bill Maher]], which after showing promise on Comedy Central was quickly snapped up by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Additionally, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' had got its start with original host [[Craig Kilborn]], although it would take a few more years for the show to reach high popularity (and a shift toward a focus on political humor) with the introduction of [[Jon Stewart]] (who was former co-host of ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'' from 1991).\n\n''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'' was also a notable original program from this era, as well as the game show ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]''. Successful non-original programming included Canadian comedy group ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'' and British shows such as the U.K. edition of ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' (the predecessor of the U.S. version, featuring much of the same American cast as would later be seen in the U.S.) and the sitcom ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]''. Some later seasons of ''AbFab'', as it was informally known, were partially financed by Comedy Central. Comedy Central also had the national rights to broadcast reruns of Seattle's ''[[Almost Live!]]'' between 1992 and 1993.\n\nAn earlier variant of the 1992 logo has the \"Comedy Central\" text bigger, almost taking up the marquee sign; that variant lasted until 1995.\n\n===1997\u201399===\nThe channel made a breakthrough when ''[[South Park]]'' premiered in 1997. Being one of the first major basic cable shows to carry the [[TV Parental Guidelines|TV-MA]] rating for mature audiences, the show was considered too controversial to be picked up by any mainstream network;<ref name=\"nytsp\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/10/business/media-broadcasting-comedy-central-makes-most-irreverent-profitable-new-cartoon.html | title=MEDIA: BROADCASTING; Comedy Central makes the most of an irreverent, and profitable, new cartoon hit | publisher=The New York Times | date=November 10, 1997 | accessdate=December 3, 2014 | author=Carter, Bill}}</ref> the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] (known for ''[[The Simpsons]]'') for example refused to pick up the series due to the over-the-top offensive content at the time.

The management of the network said that the transmitter of the 1992 and 1997 logos was said to \"communicate the 1950s broadcast era\". In 2002, [[Comedy Central Records]] was formed as a means of releasing albums by comedians that have appeared on the network.<ref name=\"presscentral\">{{cite web | url=http://press.cc.com/ | title=Home | publisher=Press Central | accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince 2003, Comedy Central has created a [[Comedy Central Roast|tradition]] of roasting comedians in the style of the [[New York Friars' Club]] roasts. During these roasts, friends of the roastee, along with other comedians, take turns making fun of the roastee, the other roasters, and occasionally audience members. So far, the roastees have included [[Denis Leary]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/leary_roast/index.jhtml |title=Official site |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Jeff Foxworthy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_foxworthy/index.jhtml |title=Comedy Central Roast of Jeff Foxworthy |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Pamela Anderson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_anderson/index.jhtml |title=Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[William Shatner]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_shatner/index.jhtml |title=Roast of Shatner |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Flavor Flav]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_flavor_flav/index.jhtml |title=Comedy Central Roast of Flavor Flav official site |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Bob Saget]], [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Rob Reiner]], [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Donald Trump]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[James Franco]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Bruce Willis]], and [[Alec Baldwin]].\n\n====The ''Secret Stash''====\nThe success of ''South Park'', despite its mature content, encouraged the network to continue to push the limits on adult language. Every Saturday and Sunday at 1 a.m. ET, a movie, comedy special, or animated program is shown unedited for language as part of a block called the ''Secret Stash''. It premiered on July 4, 2003, with the unedited cable television debut of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. Though no language is censored on the Secret Stash, most nudity in the programs is still edited out, except for limited nudity allowed in animated programs such as ''[[Drawn Together]]'', and [[Buttocks|rear nudity]].\n\n===2004\u201306===\nIn late 2004, it was reported that the four highest-rated shows on Comedy Central were, in descending order, ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[Reno 911!]]''. Shortly thereafter, [[Dave Chappelle]] backed out of the much-anticipated third season of ''Chappelle's Show''.<ref>[https://www.today.com/popculture/comedy-central-air-chappelles-remainders-wbna10337064 Comedy Central to air Chappelle remainders], [[MSNBC]], December 12, 2005.</ref> Meanwhile, ''The Daily Show'' continued to climb in the ratings. In October 2005, on the occasion of a new three-year contract for ''South Park'' and the launch of ''Daily Show'' spin-off ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', it was reported that ''South Park'' and ''The Daily Show'' were the two highest-[[Nielsen ratings|rated]] shows on Comedy Central. Comedy Central chief [[Doug Herzog]] was reported as saying that he hoped to continue to air new seasons of ''South Park'' forever, and that ''The Colbert Report'' fulfilled a long-held plan to extend the ''Daily Show'' brand.\n\nOn April 5, 2006, in a controversial two-part episode arc titled \"[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]\" and \"[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]\", ''South Park'' touched the issue of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|recent protest]] over the Danish cartoon drawings depicting the Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]]. The image of Muhammad did not appear in the episode. The episode also mocked fellow cartoon ''[[Family Guy]]''. On April 13, 2006, Comedy Central issued a statement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/04/13/165631-south-park-creators-skewer-own-network |title='South Park' Creators Skewer Own Network |publisher=Newsvine |date=April 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> which appears to confirm that the network prohibited the show's creators from airing an image of Muhammad. The statement reads, ''\"In light of recent world events, we feel we made the right decision.\"'' An anonymous source close to the show indicated{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} that ''South Park'' creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] were informed of the policy several weeks earlier and wrote this story arc in protest. This was a change of policy for Comedy Central, having allowed ''South Park'' to portray an image of Muhammad in an earlier episode, \"[[Super Best Friends]]\". Oddly enough, an image of Muhammad was still briefly visible in the opening credits of the \"Cartoon Wars\" episodes (the image had been there as a call-back to \"Super Best Friends\").\n\n===2007\u20132010===\nOn January 15, 2007, MTV Networks International launched Comedy Central in Germany which is available for free throughout Europe.

The format prior to the merger with Ha! included several original and unconventional programs such as ''Onion World'' with [[Rich Hall]] and ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', as well as laid-back variety/talk shows hosted by comedians, including ''The Sweet Life'' with [[Rachel Sweet]], ''[[Night After Night with Allan Havey]]'', ''[[Sports Monster]]'', and ''[[The Higgins Boys and Gruber]]'', the latter of whom performed sketches in between showings of vintage television series like ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'', ''[[Clutch Cargo]]'', and ''[[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp]]''.\n\nThe standard format for The Comedy Channel's shows usually involved the various hosts introducing clips culled from the acts of stand-up comedians as well as classic comedies of the 1970s and 1980s, such as ''[[Young Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Kentucky Fried Movie]]'', presented in a style similar to music videos. In the early days, certain hours of the day when clips were shown without \"host segments\" were dubbed ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]''. In 1990, hosts under this title, [[Jon Stewart]] and [[Patty Rosborough]], were introduced. Comedian [[Marc Maron]] also hosted the series.\n\nWhile The Comedy Channel broadcast mostly low-budget original programming,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/01/the-origin-and-early-programs-of-comedy-central |title=The Origin and Early Programs of Comedy Central |author=Boone, Brian |date=January 12, 2012 |work=Splitsider |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315124954/http://splitsider.com/2012/01/the-origin-and-early-programs-of-comedy-central |archive-date=March 15, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Ha!'s schedule featured sitcom and sketch comedy reruns (many of which had been previously licensed for sister network [[Nick at Nite]]) as well as complete 90-minute reruns of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' from the sixth through 16th seasons.\n\nAfter two years of limited distribution, the two channels merged into one, relaunching on [[April Fools' Day|April 1]], 1991 as CTV: The Comedy Network; it later changed its name to Comedy Central on June 1, 1991<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fredalan.org/post/48928291883/the-naming-of-comedy-central|title=The naming of Comedy Central.|first=Peter|last=Vidani|publisher=}}</ref> to prevent issues with the [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] broadcast television network [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], which would eventually be its Canadian content partner through [[The Comedy Network]] when that channel started operations six years later.

Except for the cult favorite ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', the channel had a relatively small viewership. A notable early success was ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' with [[Bill Maher]], which after showing promise on Comedy Central was quickly snapped up by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Additionally, ''[[The Daily Show]]'' had got its start with original host [[Craig Kilborn]], although it would take a few more years for the show to reach high popularity (and a shift toward a focus on political humor) with the introduction of [[Jon Stewart]] (who was former co-host of ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'' from 1991).\n\n''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'' was also a notable original program from this era, as well as the game show ''[[Win Ben Stein's Money]]''. Successful non-original programming included Canadian comedy group ''[[The Kids in the Hall]]'' and British shows such as the U.K. edition of ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway? (UK TV series)|Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'' (the predecessor of the U.S. version, featuring much of the same American cast as would later be seen in the U.S.) and the sitcom ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]''. Some later seasons of ''AbFab'', as it was informally known, were partially financed by Comedy Central. Comedy Central also had the national rights to broadcast reruns of Seattle's ''[[Almost Live!]]'' between 1992 and 1993.\n\nAn earlier variant of the 1992 logo has the \"Comedy Central\" text bigger, almost taking up the marquee sign; that variant lasted until 1995.\n\n===1997\u201399===\nThe channel made a breakthrough when ''[[South Park]]'' premiered in 1997. Being one of the first major basic cable shows to carry the [[TV Parental Guidelines|TV-MA]] rating for mature audiences, the show was considered too controversial to be picked up by any mainstream network;<ref name=\"nytsp\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/10/business/media-broadcasting-comedy-central-makes-most-irreverent-profitable-new-cartoon.html | title=MEDIA: BROADCASTING; Comedy Central makes the most of an irreverent, and profitable, new cartoon hit | publisher=The New York Times | date=November 10, 1997 | accessdate=December 3, 2014 | author=Carter, Bill}}</ref> the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] (known for ''[[The Simpsons]]'') for example refused to pick up the series due to the over-the-top offensive content at the time. As [[word of mouth]] spread, the number of people who requested that Comedy Central be added to their cable providers increased, and the channel became available in over 50% of American homes by 1998.\n\n===2000\u201303===\n[[File:Comedy Central logo.svg|thumb|left|145px|Comedy Central logo used from 2000 to 2010.]]\nOn November 13, 2000, Comedy Central introduced a modernized version of its globe logo, by straightening the buildings and removing the transmitter and marquee. The management of the network said that the transmitter of the 1992 and 1997 logos was said to \"communicate the 1950s broadcast era\". In 2002, [[Comedy Central Records]] was formed as a means of releasing albums by comedians that have appeared on the network.<ref name=\"presscentral\">{{cite web | url=http://press.cc.com/ | title=Home | publisher=Press Central | accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince 2003, Comedy Central has created a [[Comedy Central Roast|tradition]] of roasting comedians in the style of the [[New York Friars' Club]] roasts. During these roasts, friends of the roastee, along with other comedians, take turns making fun of the roastee, the other roasters, and occasionally audience members. So far, the roastees have included [[Denis Leary]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/leary_roast/index.jhtml |title=Official site |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Jeff Foxworthy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_foxworthy/index.jhtml |title=Comedy Central Roast of Jeff Foxworthy |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Pamela Anderson]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_anderson/index.jhtml |title=Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[William Shatner]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_shatner/index.jhtml |title=Roast of Shatner |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Flavor Flav]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/roast_flavor_flav/index.jhtml |title=Comedy Central Roast of Flavor Flav official site |publisher=Comedy Central |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Bob Saget]], [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Rob Reiner]], [[David Hasselhoff]], [[Donald Trump]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Roseanne Barr]], [[James Franco]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Rob Lowe]], [[Bruce Willis]], and [[Alec Baldwin]].\n\n====The ''Secret Stash''====\nThe success of ''South Park'', despite its mature content, encouraged the network to continue to push the limits on adult language. Every Saturday and Sunday at 1 a.m. ET, a movie, comedy special, or animated program is shown unedited for language as part of a block called the ''Secret Stash''. It premiered on July 4, 2003, with the unedited cable television debut of ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut]]''. Though no language is censored on the Secret Stash, most nudity in the programs is still edited out, except for limited nudity allowed in animated programs such as ''[[Drawn Together]]'', and [[Buttocks|rear nudity]].\n\n===2004\u201306===\nIn late 2004, it was reported that the four highest-rated shows on Comedy Central were, in descending order, ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' and ''[[Reno 911!]]''. Shortly thereafter, [[Dave Chappelle]] backed out of the much-anticipated third season of ''Chappelle's Show''.<ref>[https://www.today.com/popculture/comedy-central-air-chappelles-remainders-wbna10337064 Comedy Central to air Chappelle remainders], [[MSNBC]], December 12, 2005.</ref> Meanwhile, ''The Daily Show'' continued to climb in the ratings. In October 2005, on the occasion of a new three-year contract for ''South Park'' and the launch of ''Daily Show'' spin-off ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', it was reported that ''South Park'' and ''The Daily Show'' were the two highest-[[Nielsen ratings|rated]] shows on Comedy Central. Comedy Central chief [[Doug Herzog]] was reported as saying that he hoped to continue to air new seasons of ''South Park'' forever, and that ''The Colbert Report'' fulfilled a long-held plan to extend the ''Daily Show'' brand.\n\nOn April 5, 2006, in a controversial two-part episode arc titled \"[[Cartoon Wars Part I]]\" and \"[[Cartoon Wars Part II]]\", ''South Park'' touched the issue of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|recent protest]] over the Danish cartoon drawings depicting the Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]]. The image of Muhammad did not appear in the episode. The episode also mocked fellow cartoon ''[[Family Guy]]''. On April 13, 2006, Comedy Central issued a statement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/04/13/165631-south-park-creators-skewer-own-network |title='South Park' Creators Skewer Own Network |publisher=Newsvine |date=April 13, 2006 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref> which appears to confirm that the network prohibited the show's creators from airing an image of Muhammad. The statement reads, ''\"In light of recent world events, we feel we made the right decision.\"'' An anonymous source close to the show indicated{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} that ''South Park'' creators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] were informed of the policy several weeks earlier and wrote this story arc in protest. This was a change of policy for Comedy Central, having allowed ''South Park'' to portray an image of Muhammad in an earlier episode, \"[[Super Best Friends]]\". Oddly enough, an image of Muhammad was still briefly visible in the opening credits of the \"Cartoon Wars\" episodes (the image had been there as a call-back to \"Super Best Friends\").\n\n===2007\u20132010===\nOn January 15, 2007, MTV Networks International launched Comedy Central in Germany which is available for free throughout Europe.

However, the [[fair copy]], penned by the same scribe as the draft copy, and which was in the possession of Lucy and on which she registered a copyright, includes in the narrative a copy of the 1838 version of the first vision, beginning with Joseph's words \"I was at this time in my fifteenth year.\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1845|p=73}}</ref> After the first vision account, Lucy continues with \"From this time until the 21st of Sep. 1823, Joseph continued as usual to labor with his father; and nothing during this interval occured of very great importance...\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1845|p=78}}</ref> At this point Lucy describes the visitations of Moroni and the promise of the golden plates, followed by the death of [[Alvin Smith (brother of Joseph Smith)|Alvin]], in November 1823.\n\nLucy then states that she and some of her children sought comfort in the religious revival after Alvin's death. This statement has been taken to refer to her and three of the children ([[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel]], and Sophronia) joining the Presbyterian church.<ref>\"Lucy said that soon after Alvin's death, Palmyra experienced 'a great revival in religion, and the whole neighborhood was very much aroused to the subject, and we among the rest flocked to meeting house to see if there was a word of comfort for us that might relieve our over charged feelings.' She eventually decided to join the Presbyterian church.\"{{Harv|Vogel|2004|p=58}}.</ref> If so, and if Joseph's statement that they joined this church in the same year as his first vision is accurate, then the first vision would have taken place in 1824.<ref>[[Marvin Hill]] has written, \"I am inclined to agree that the religious turmoil that Smith described which led to some family members joining the Presbyterians and to much sectarian bitterness does not fit well into the 1820 context detailed by Backman. ... Indicating that the angel had told Smith of the plates prior to the revival, Lucy added that for a long time after Alvin's death the family could not bear any talk about the golden plates, for the subject had been one of great interest to him and any reference to the plates stirred sorrowful memories. She said she attended the revival with hope of gaining solace for Alvin's loss. That kind of detail is just the sort that gives validity to Lucy's chronology. She would not have been likely to make up such a reaction for herself or the family nor mistake the time when it happened. I am persuaded that it was 1824 when Lucy joined the Presbyterians.\" {{Harv|Hill|1982|p=39}}.</ref> However, this conclusion requires ignoring both Joseph's statement that the first vision occurred during his fifteenth year and Lucy's chronology in the fair copy. Alternatively, [[D.

In the canonized version, Smith wrote that the First Vision occurred in \"the second year after our removal to Manchester.\"<ref name=\"Joseph Smith\u2013History 1:5\"/> The evidence for the date of this move has been interpreted by believers as supporting 1820 and by non-believers as supporting 1824.<ref>Manchester land assessment records show an increase in assessed value of the Smith property in 1823. Because the tax assessment of the Smiths' Manchester land rose in 1823, critics argue that the Smiths completed their Manchester cabin in 1822, which suggests an approximate date of 1824 for the First Vision. Joseph Smith, Sr. was first taxed for Manchester land in 1820. In 1821 and 1822, the land was valued at $700, but in 1823, the property was assessed at $1000, which may indicate \"that the Smiths had completed construction of their cabin and cleared a significant portion of their land\" {{harv|Vogel|2000|pp=443\u201344}}. In response, some Mormon apologists argue that in 1818, the Smiths mistakenly constructed a cabin 59 feet north of the actual property line (which would have been in Palmyra rather than Manchester) and the 1823 increase in the property assessment was related to the completion of a wood frame home on the Manchester side of the Palmyra\u2013Manchester township line. The latter interpretation would lend support for dating the First Vision to 1820 {{Harv|Ray|2002|pp=4\u20135}}. For a counter argument\u2014that there was a second cabin on the Smith property in Manchester\u2014see {{harvnb|Vogel|2000|pp=416\u201319}}. Vogel argues that based on archaeological and documentary evidence, the Manchester cabin was constructed prior to the Smiths' building of their frame home. \"To argue for the existence of only the Jennings cabin, which the Smiths inadvertently built on the Palmyra side of the township line, one must assume that the error was perpetuated not only by the Smiths but also by authorities in both counties. However, the existence of the names of Joseph Sr., Alvin, and Hyrum on the Palmyra road lists for 1820\u201322 strongly argues that both the Smiths and village authorities understood that the cabin was in Palmyra township.\"(419)</ref>\n\nIn the 1838 account Smith said that this vision occurred \"on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty.\"<ref>[[Joseph Smith\u2013History]] [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.14?lang=eng 1:14].</ref> Two Latter-day saints, researching weather reports and maple sugar production records, argue in a non-peer-reviewed magazine article that the most likely exact date for the First Vision was Palm Sunday, March 26, 1820.<ref>{{citation |title=Oh, How Lovely Was the Morning: Sun 26 Mar 1820? |work=[[Meridian Magazine]] |date=October 9, 2002 |first=John C. |last=Lefgren }}.

In the \"Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ,\" Smith recounted his early history, noting\n\n<blockquote>\"For, after that it truly was manifested unto [Smith] that he had received remission of his sins, he was entangled again in the vanities of the world, but after truly repenting, God visited him by an holy angel ... and gave unto him power, by the means which was before prepared that he should translate a book.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Howe|1831}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nNo further explanation of this \"manifestation\" is provided.

Cheesman]], a graduate student at Brigham Young University. This is a handwritten manuscript apparently composed about 1833 and either written or dictated by Joseph Smith. It contains an account of the early experiences of the Mormon prophet and includes the story of the first vision. While the story varies in some details from the version presently accepted, enough is there to indicate that at least as early as 1833 Joseph Smith contemplated writing and perhaps publishing it. The manuscript has apparently lain in the L.D.S. Church Historian's office for many years, and yet few if any who saw it realized its profound historical significance.\" {{harv|Allen|1966|p=35}}</ref>  Sometime around 1930, the pages on which the account was written were torn from the letter book, removed from the Church Historian's collection and placed into a private safe in the custody of Apostle [[Joseph Fielding Smith]].  In 1952, General Authority [[Levi E. Young]] met with amateur historian LaMar Peterson and told him of a \"strange account\" in Joseph's handwriting that did not mention God the Father.  In 1964, Peterson told [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] about the account, and they subsequently asked permission from Joseph Fielding Smith to see it, but were denied.  In 1964, Smith authorized the showing of the account to Paul R. Cheesman, a BYU student working on his master's thesis.

In one issue, Cowdery explained that Smith was confused by the different religions and local revivals during his \"15th year\" (1820), leading him to wonder which church was true. In the next issue of the biography, Cowdery explained that reference to Smith's \"15th year\" was a typographical error, and that actually the revivals and religious confusion took place in Smith's \"17th year.\"\n\nTherefore, according to Cowdery, the religious confusion led Smith to pray in his bedroom, late on the night of September 23, 1823, after the others had gone to sleep, to know which of the competing denominations was correct and whether \"a Supreme being did exist.\" In response, an angel appeared and granted him forgiveness of his sins. The remainder of the story roughly parallels Smith's later description of a visit by an angel in 1823 who told him about the [[golden plates]]. Thus, Cowdery's account, containing a single vision, differs from Smith's 1832 account, which contains two separate visions, one in 1821 prompted by religious confusion (the First Vision) and a separate one regarding the plates on September 22, 1822. Cowdery's account also differs from Smith's 1842 account, which includes a First Vision in 1820 and a second vision on September 22, 1823.\n\n===1835 Smith accounts===\nOn November 9, 1835, Smith dictated an account of the First Vision in his diary after telling it to a stranger<ref>The stranger was [[Robert Matthews (religious figure)|Robert Matthias]], a religious con-artist using the alias \"Joshua the Jewish minister\". Bushman, ''Rough Stone Rolling'', 275-76.</ref> who had visited his home earlier that day.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=22\u201324}}.</ref> Smith said that when perplexed about religions matters, he had gone to a grove to pray<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=23}}.</ref> but that his tongue seemed swollen in his mouth and that he had been interrupted twice by the sound of someone walking behind him.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=23\u201324}}.</ref> Finally, as he prayed, he said his tongue was loosed, and he saw a pillar of fire in which an unidentified \"personage\" appeared.<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\">{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=24}}.</ref> Then another unidentified personage told Smith his sins were forgiven and \"testified unto [Smith] that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> An interlineation in the text notes, \"and I saw many angels in this vision.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> Smith said this vision occurred when he was 14 years old and that when he was 17, he \"saw another vision of angels in the night season after I had retired to bed\" (referring to the later visit of the [[angel Moroni]] who showed him the location of the [[golden plates]]).<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> Smith identified none of these personages or angels with \"the Lord\" as he had in 1832.<ref>Abanes,{{specify|date=April 2012}} 16: [http://www.irr.org/mit/First-Vision-Scans/first-vision-1835A.html the 1835 account] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414033852/http://www.irr.org/mit/First-Vision-Scans/first-vision-1835A.html |date=April 14, 2005 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}. In 1835, Smith approved the \"[[Lectures on Faith]]\", an orderly presentation of Mormonism (probably written by [[Sidney Rigdon]]) in which it was taught that although Jesus Christ had a tangible body of flesh, God the Father was a spiritual presence\u2014a view not out of harmony with orthodox Christian belief. The \"Lectures on Faith\" were canonized by the LDS Church and included as part of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] until de-canonized after 1921. (Bushman,''Rough Stone Rolling'', 283\u201384.)</ref>\n\nA few days later, on November 14, 1835, Smith told the story to another visitor, Erastus Holmes.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=35}}.</ref> In his journal, Smith said that he had recited his life story \"up to the time I received the first visitation of angels, which was when I was about fourteen years old.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=35\u201336}}. When LDS Church historian [[B. H. Roberts]] included this account into his ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''2''':312, he changed the words \"first visitation of angels\" to \"first vision.\"</ref>\n\n===1838 Smith account===\n\nIn 1838, Smith began dictating a history, introduced as \"I have been induced to write this history ... in relation both to myself and the Church.\"<ref>The original 1838 manuscript has been lost, but the account was copied to manuscripts dating from 1839, which indicates that the year of writing was 1838, a fact also confirmed by Smith's journal entries. See {{Harvtxt|Jessee|1969|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> This history included a new account of the First Vision, later published in three issues of ''[[Times and Seasons]]''.<ref>''[[Times and Seasons]]'', March and April, vol. 3 nos. 9, 11.</ref> This version was later incorporated into the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]], which was canonized by the LDS Church in 1880, as [[Joseph Smith\u2013History]]. Thus, it is often called the [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng \"canonized version\"] of the First Vision story.\n\nThis version differs from the 1840 version because it includes the proclamation, \"This is My Beloved Son, hear Him\" from one of the personages, whereas the 1840 version does not. The canonized version says that in the spring of 1820, during a period of \"confusion and strife among the different denominations\" following an \"unusual excitement on the subject of religion\", Smith had debated which of the various Christian groups he should join. While in turmoil, he read from the [[Epistle of James]]: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"<ref>James 1:5; [[Joseph Smith\u2013History]].</ref>\n\nOne morning, deeply impressed by this scripture, the fourteen-year-old Smith went to the woods near his home, knelt, and began his first vocal prayer. Almost immediately he was confronted by an evil power that prevented speech. A darkness gathered around him, and Smith believed that he would be destroyed. He continued the prayer silently, asking for God's assistance though still resigned to destruction. At this moment a light brighter than the sun descended towards him, and he was delivered from the evil power.\n\nIn the light, Smith \"saw two personages standing in the air\". One pointed to the other and said, \"This is My Beloved Son, hear Him.\" Smith asked which religious sect he should join and was told to join none of them because all existing religions had corrupted the teachings of Jesus Christ.<ref>''See'' [[Great Apostasy]].</ref>\n\nIn his 1838 account, Smith wrote that he made an oblique reference to the vision to his mother in 1820, telling her the day it happened that he had \"learned for [him]self that [[Presbyterian]]ism is not true.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 6}}</ref> Lucy did not mention this conversation in her memoirs in her own words, but included the narrative from Joseph's 1838 account directly.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1853|p=78}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url= http://woodlandinstitute.com/joseph/first-vision/pubSeerPg5JosephSmith1838.php |title=The First Vision: 1838 Joseph Smith History Account |work=Woodland Institute |publisher=[[Richard N.

Porter, the Methodist minister, George Lane, may have passed very near the Smith home and preached at a camp meeting along the way in July 1820. \"In the pursuit of his ministerial duties Rev. Lane was in the geographical proximity of Joseph Smith on a number of occasions between the years 1819-1825. The nature degree or indeed the actuality of their acquaintanceship during this interval poses a number of interesting possibilities .... In July 1820 Lane would have had to pass through the greater Palmyra-Manchester vicinity..unless he went by an extremely circuitous route. Present records do not specify Lane's itinerary or exact route ... but they do for Lane's friend, Rev. George Peck .... [Peck's] conference route took him north to Ithaca, then on to a camp meeting in the Holland Purchase, subsequently passing along the Ridge Road to Rochester .... As Rev. Peck, [Lane] may even have stopped at a camp meeting somewhere along the way. A preacher of his standing would always be a welcome guest.\" {{harv|Porter|1969|p=335}}.

As a result, he said, he received immediate criticism in the community. There is little if any evidence, however, that by the early 1830s Joseph Smith was telling the story in public. At least if he were telling it, no one seemed to consider it important enough to have recorded it ''at the time'', and no one was criticizing him for it.\"</ref> None of the earliest [[anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] literature mentioned the First Vision.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1966|p=31}}: \"Apparently not until 1843, when the ''New York Spectator'' printed a reporter's account of an interview with Joseph Smith, did a ''non-Mormon'' source publish any reference to the story of the first vision.\"</ref> Smith also said he told others about the vision during the 1820s, and some family members said that they had heard him mention it, but none prior to 1823, when Smith said he had his second vision.<ref>{{Harvnb|Palmer|2002|p=245}}: \"There is no evidence of prejudice resulting from this first vision.  If his report that 'all the sects...united to persecute me' were accurate, one would expect to find some hint of this in the local newspapers, narratives by ardent critics, and in the affidavits D. P. Hurlbut gathered in 1833. The record is nevertheless silent on this issue. No one, friend or foe, in New York or Pennsylvania remember either that there was 'great persecution' or even that Joseph claimed to have had a vision. Not even his family remembers it.\"</ref> Joseph's mother recorded the 1820-23 persecution of Joseph in her memoir, stating \"From this time until the 21st of Sep. 1823, Joseph continued as usual to labor with his father; and nothing during this interval occurred of very great importance; though he suffered, as one would naturally suppose every kind of opposition and persecution from the different orders of religion.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1845|p=78}}</ref>\n\n===1840 Pratt account===\nIn September 1840, [[Orson Pratt]] published a version of the First Vision in England.<ref>Orson Pratt, \"Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions\", Orson Pratt, Ballantyne and Huges publ, 1840 (reprinted in [[Dean Jessee|Jessee]],{{specify|date=April 2012}} vol. 1 pp. 149\u201360)</ref>  This version states that after Smith saw the light, \"his mind was caught away, from the natural objects with which he was surrounded; and he was enwrapped in a heavenly vision.\"<ref name=\"Pratt 1840 5\">{{Harvnb|Pratt|1840|p=5}}</ref> Pratt's account referred to \"two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in their features or likeness\".<ref name=\"Pratt 1840 5\"/>\n\n===1842 Wentworth Letter===\nIn 1842, two years before his death, Smith wrote to [[John Wentworth (mayor)|John Wentworth]], editor of the ''[[Chicago Democrat]]'', outlining the basic beliefs of his church and including an account of the First Vision.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1842a|pp=706\u2013710}}.</ref> Smith said that he had been \"about fourteen years of age\" when he had received the First Vision.<ref name=\"Harv|Smith|1842a|pp=706\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1842a|pp=706}}</ref> Like the Pratt account, Smith's [[Wentworth letter]] said that his \"mind was taken away from the objects with which I was surrounded, and I was enwrapped in a heavenly vision.\"<ref name=\"Harv|Smith|1842a|pp=706\"/> and had seen \"two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in features, and likeness, surrounded with a brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noon-day.\"<ref name=\"Harv|Smith|1842a|pp=707\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1842a|pp=707}}</ref> Smith said he was told that no religious denomination \"was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom\" and that he was \"expressly commanded to 'go not after them.'\"<ref name=\"Harv|Smith|1842a|pp=707\"/>\n\n===Smith's accounts found in later reminiscences===\nLate in his life, Smith's brother [[William Smith (Mormonism)|William]] gave two accounts of the First Vision, dating it to 1823,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1883|pp=6\u20138}}</ref> when William was twelve years old. William said the religious excitement in Palmyra had occurred in 1822\u201323 (rather than the actual date of 1824\u201325);<ref>{{Harvnb|Persuitte|2000|p=26}}</ref> that it was stimulated by the preaching of a Methodist, the Rev. George Lane, a \"great revival preacher\"; and that his mother and some of his siblings had then joined the Presbyterian church.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1883|p=6}}</ref>\n\nWilliam Smith said he based his account on what Joseph had told William and the rest of his family the day after the First Vision:<ref name=\"Smith 1883 6, 8\u20139\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1883|pp=6, 8\u20139}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[A] light appeared in the heavens, and descended until it rested upon the trees where he was.

Joseph's own salvation gave way to the opening of a new era of history.\")</ref> In early accounts, Smith seems reluctant to talk about the vision; in later versions, various details are mentioned that were not mentioned in the earliest narratives.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=39\u201340}} (\"At first, Joseph was reluctant to talk about his vision .... When he described the First Vision in 1832, he abbreviated the experience.\")</ref>\n\n[[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] cite the multiple versions of the First Vision as evidence that it may have been fabricated by Smith.<ref>{{Citation |title=Mormonism: Shadow or Reality? |first=Jerald and Sandra |last=Tanner |authorlink=Jerald and Sandra Tanner |publisher=Utah Lighthouse Ministry |year=1987 |edition=5th |pages=143\u201362}}</ref> For instance, they have specifically pointed out that it is unclear between various versions whether Smith was 14 or 15 at the time of the vision; whether he attended a contemporaneous religious revival; whether the supernatural personages told Smith that his sins were forgiven; whether the personages were angels, Jesus, God, or some combination; and whether Smith had already determined for himself that all churches were false before he experienced the vision. However, [[Stephen Prothero]] argues that any historian should expect to find differences in narratives written many years apart, and that the key elements are present in all the accounts.<ref>{{cite book|title=American Jesus: How the Son of God Became a National Icon Publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux| year=2003 |page=171}} (\"Any good lawyer (or historian) would expect to find contradictions or competing narratives written down years apart and decades after the event.

In each case, God tells him to remain aloof from all Christian denominations, as something better is in store.\")</ref>\n\nSome believers view differences in the accounts as overstated. [[Richard L. Anderson]] wrote, \"What are the main problems of interpreting so many accounts? The first problem is the interpreter. One person perceives harmony and interconnections while another overstates differences.\"<ref name=\"Anderson\">\"One person perceives harmony and interconnections while another overstates differences. Think of how you retell a vivid event in your life\u2014marriage, first day on the job, or an automobile accident. A record of all your comments would include short and long versions, along with many bits and pieces. Only by blending these glimpses can an outsider reconstruct what originally happened. The biggest trap is comparing description in one report with silence in another. By assuming that what is not said is not known, some come up with arbitrary theories of an evolution in the Prophet's story. Yet we often omit parts of an episode because of the chance of the moment, not having time to tell everything, or deliberately stressing only a part of the original event in a particular situation. This means that any First Vision account contains some fraction of the whole experience. Combining all reliable reports will recreate the basics of Joseph Smith's quest and conversation with the Father and Son.\"{{Harv|Anderson|1996}}</ref> Other believers view the differences in the accounts as reflective of Smith's increase in maturity and knowledge over time.<ref>\"I've actually studied the various accounts of Joseph's First Vision, and I'm struck by the difference in his recountings.

Early adherents were unaware of the details of the vision until 1840, when the earliest accounts were published in [[Great Britain]]. An account of the First Vision was not published in the United States until 1842, shortly before [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]]. [[Jan Shipps]] has written that the vision was \"practically unknown\" until an account of it was published in 1842.<ref>{{harvnb|Shipps|1985|p=30}}. The first extant account of the First Vision is the manuscript account in Joseph Smith, \"Manuscript History of the Church\" (1839); the first published account is Orson Pratt, \"An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions and of the Late Discovery of Ancient American Records\" (Edinburgh: Ballantyne and Hughes, 1840); and the first American publication is Smith's letter to John Wentworth in ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' '''3''' (March 1842): 706\u201308, only two years before Smith's assassination.

Now he was called by God the Father and Jesus Christ in 1820 during an extended revival, was forbidden to join any existing church, and was greatly persecuted by institutions and individuals for sharing his vision of God. This version is not supported by historical evidence.\" (253\u201354)</ref>\n\nLeaders of the LDS Church have acknowledged that the First Vision as well as the [[Book of Mormon]] and Smith himself constitute \"stumbling blocks for many.\" [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Neal A. Maxwell]] wrote:\n<blockquote>In our own time, Joseph Smith, the First Vision, and the Book of Mormon constitute stumbling blocks for many\u2014around which they cannot get\u2014unless they are meek enough to examine all the evidence at hand, not being exclusionary as a result of accumulated attitudes in a secular society. Humbleness of mind is the initiator of expansiveness of mind.<ref>Neal A. Maxwell, ''Meek and Lowly'' (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1987) p. 76.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a 2007 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary, [[Richard Mouw]], an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Theology|theologian]] and student of Mormonism, summarized his feelings about the First Vision:\n<blockquote>My instinct is to attribute a sincerity to Joseph Smith. And yet at the same time, as an evangelical Christian, I do not believe that the members of the godhead really appeared to him and told him that he should start on a mission of, among other things, denouncing the kinds of things that I believe as a Presbyterian. I can't believe that. And yet at the same time, I really don't believe that he was simply making up a story that he knew to be false in order to manipulate people and to gain power over a religious movement. And so I live with the mystery.<ref>{{citation |contribution-url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/etc/script.html |contribution=Part One (Night One Transcript) |title=The Mormons |author=''[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]'' and ''[[American Experience]]'' |editor=[[Helen Whitney]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|title-link=The Mormons (film) }}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==Side by Side Comparison of Joseph Smith Vision Accounts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | Summer 1832 History<ref>\"History, circa Summer 1832,\" p. 1, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-summer-1832/1</ref> \n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | November 1835 Journal<ref>\"Journal, 1835\u20131836,\" p. 23, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-1835-1836/24</ref> \n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | 1838 History<ref>\"History, circa June 1839\u2013circa 1841 [Draft 2],\" p. 2, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-june-1839-circa-1841-draft-2/2</ref> \n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | 1842 Wentworth Letter<ref>\"\u201cChurch History,\u201d 1 March 1842,\" p. 706, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/church-history-1-march-1842/1</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | My mind became exceedingly distressed, for I became convicted of my sins, and by searching the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatized from the true and living faith, and there was no society or denomination that was built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament. I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world, for I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday, today, and forever, that he was no respecter of persons, for he was God.\n|  style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | \nBeing wrought up in my mind respecting the subject of religion, and looking at the different systems taught the children of men, I knew not who was right or who was wrong. \n|  style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | \nMy mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant. The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists, and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were in error. On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and disprove all others.\n\nIn the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be aright, which is it, and how shall I know it?\n\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | When about fourteen years of age, I began to reflect upon the importance of being prepared for a future state, and upon enquiring about the plan of salvation, I found that there was a great clash in religious sentiment; if I went to one society, they referred me to one plan, and another to another, each one pointing to his own particular creed as the summum bonum of perfection. Considering that all could not be right, and that God could not be the author of so much confusion, I determined to investigate the subject more fully, believing that if God had a church it would not be split up into factions, and that if he taught one society to worship one way, and administer in one set of ordinances, he would not teach another principles which were diametrically opposed. \n\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | For I looked upon the sun, the glorious luminary of the earth, and also the moon, rolling in their majesty through the heavens, and also the stars shining in their courses, and the earth also upon which I stood, and the beasts of the \ufb01eld, and the fowls of heaven, and the \ufb01sh of the waters, and also man walking forth upon the face of the earth in majesty and in the strength of beauty, whose power and intelligence in governing the things which are so exceedingly great and marvelous, even in the likeness of him who created them. And when I considered upon these things, my heart exclaimed, \u201cWell hath the wise man said, \u2018It is a fool that saith in his heart, there is no God.\u2019\u201d My heart exclaimed, \u201cAll, all these bear testimony and bespeak an omnipotent and omnipresent power, a being who maketh laws and decreeth and bindeth all things in their bounds, who \ufb01lleth eternity, who was and is and will be from all eternity to eternity.\u201d And I considered all these things and that that being seeketh such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nAnd considering it of the first importance that I should be right in matters that involve eternal consequences, being thus perplexed in mind I retired to the silent grove and bowed down before the Lord, under a realizing sense that he had said (if the Bible be true), \u201cAsk, and you shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened; seek, and you shall find,\u201d and again, \u201cIf any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\u201d  Information was what I most desired at this time, and with a fixed determination to obtain it, \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nWhile I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n\nNever did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.\n\nAt length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to \u201cask of God,\u201d concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nBelieving the word of God, I had confidence in the declaration of James; \u201cIf any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.\u201d\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| Therefore, I cried unto the Lord for mercy, for there was none else to whom I could go and obtain mercy.  And the Lord heard my cry in the wilderness, and while in the attitude of calling upon the Lord, in the sixteenth year of my age,\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| I called upon the Lord for the first time in the place above stated. Or in other words, I made a fruitless attempt to pray; my tongue seemed to be swollen in my mouth, so that I could not utter. I heard a noise behind me, like some person walking towards me. I strove again to pray but could not. The noise of walking seemed to draw nearer. I sprung up on my feet and looked around but saw no person or thing that was calculated to produce the noise of walking.\n\nI kneeled again. My mouth was opened and my tongue liberated, and I called on the Lord in mighty prayer. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nSo, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally.\n\nAfter I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.  But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction\u2014not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being\u2014just at this moment of great alarm,\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nI retired to a secret place in a grove and began to call upon the Lord.  While fervently engaged in supplication, my mind was taken away from the objects with which I was surrounded, \n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | a pillar of light above the brightness of the sun at noonday came down from above and rested upon me. I was \ufb01lled with the spirit of God, and the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| A pillar of fire appeared above my head. It presently rested down upon me and filled me with joy unspeakable. A personage appeared in the midst of this pillar of flame, which was spread all around and yet nothing consumed. Another personage soon appeared, like unto the first. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|  I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.\n\nIt no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other\u2014This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|  and I was enwrapped in a heavenly vision and saw two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in features and likeness, surrounded with a brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noonday. \n\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | And he spake unto me, saying, \u201cJoseph, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way, walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of glory. I was crucified for the world, that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life. Behold, the world lieth in sin at this time, and none doeth good, no, not one. They have turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments. They draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me. And mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth, to visit them according to their ungodliness and to bring to pass that which hath been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and apostles. Behold and lo, I come quickly, as it is written of me, in the cloud, clothed in the glory of my Father.\u201d\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| He said unto me, \u201cThy sins are forgiven thee.\u201d He testified unto me that Jesus Christ is the son of God. And I saw many angels in this vision.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)\u2014and which I should join.\n\nI was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that: \u201cthey draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.\u201d\n\nHe again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time. When I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up into heaven. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| They told me that all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines and that none of them was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom. And I was expressly commanded to \u201cgo not after them,\u201d at the same time receiving a promise that the fulness of the gospel should at some future time be made known unto me.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | My soul was \ufb01lled with love, and for many days I could rejoice with great joy. The Lord was with me, but I could \ufb01nd none that would believe the heavenly vision. Nevertheless, I pondered these things in my heart.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| I was about fourteen years old when I received this first communication.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon recovering in some degree, I went home. And as I leaned up to the fireplace, mother inquired what the matter was. I replied, \u201cNever mind, all is well\u2014I am well enough off.\u201d I then said to my mother, \u201cI have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true.\u201d It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Allen\n | first = James B.\n | author-link = James B.

Smith described it as a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]  in which he received instruction from [[God the Father]] and [[Jesus Christ]]. \n\nAccording to the account Smith told in 1838, he went to the woods to pray about which church to join but fell into the grip of an evil power that nearly overcame him. At the last moment, he was rescued by two shining \"Personages\" (implied to be [[God the Father]] and [[Jesus]]) who hovered above him. One of the beings told Smith not to join any existing churches because all taught incorrect doctrines.\n\nSmith wrote several accounts of the vision between 1832 and 1842, two of which were published in his lifetime. <ref>{{citation |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/topics/first-vision-accounts |title= First Vision Accounts |work= churchofjesuschrist.org |publisher= The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}</ref> Consistency of the accounts is a subject of debate, whether variations are indicators of significant shifts in Smith's theology or are simply changing emphasis of minor details. <ref>James B.

However, the [[fair copy]], penned by the same scribe as the draft copy, and which was in the possession of Lucy and on which she registered a copyright, includes in the narrative a copy of the 1838 version of the first vision, beginning with Joseph's words \"I was at this time in my fifteenth year.\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1845|p=73}}</ref> After the first vision account, Lucy continues with \"From this time until the 21st of Sep. 1823, Joseph continued as usual to labor with his father; and nothing during this interval occured of very great importance...\" <ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1845|p=78}}</ref> At this point Lucy describes the visitations of Moroni and the promise of the golden plates, followed by the death of [[Alvin Smith (brother of Joseph Smith)|Alvin]], in November 1823.\n\nLucy then states that she and some of her children sought comfort in the religious revival after Alvin's death. This statement has been taken to refer to her and three of the children ([[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]], [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel]], and Sophronia) joining the Presbyterian church.<ref>\"Lucy said that soon after Alvin's death, Palmyra experienced 'a great revival in religion, and the whole neighborhood was very much aroused to the subject, and we among the rest flocked to meeting house to see if there was a word of comfort for us that might relieve our over charged feelings.' She eventually decided to join the Presbyterian church.\"{{Harv|Vogel|2004|p=58}}.</ref> If so, and if Joseph's statement that they joined this church in the same year as his first vision is accurate, then the first vision would have taken place in 1824.<ref>[[Marvin Hill]] has written, \"I am inclined to agree that the religious turmoil that Smith described which led to some family members joining the Presbyterians and to much sectarian bitterness does not fit well into the 1820 context detailed by Backman. ... Indicating that the angel had told Smith of the plates prior to the revival, Lucy added that for a long time after Alvin's death the family could not bear any talk about the golden plates, for the subject had been one of great interest to him and any reference to the plates stirred sorrowful memories. She said she attended the revival with hope of gaining solace for Alvin's loss. That kind of detail is just the sort that gives validity to Lucy's chronology. She would not have been likely to make up such a reaction for herself or the family nor mistake the time when it happened. I am persuaded that it was 1824 when Lucy joined the Presbyterians.\" {{Harv|Hill|1982|p=39}}.</ref> However, this conclusion requires ignoring both Joseph's statement that the first vision occurred during his fifteenth year and Lucy's chronology in the fair copy. Alternatively, [[D. Michael Quinn]] says that Joseph Smith's account is a conflation of events over several years, a typical biographical device for streamlining the narrative.<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|2006|p=12}}.</ref>\n\nLocal moves of the Smith family have also been used in attempts to identify the date of the vision. In the canonized version, Smith wrote that the First Vision occurred in \"the second year after our removal to Manchester.\"<ref name=\"Joseph Smith\u2013History 1:5\"/> The evidence for the date of this move has been interpreted by believers as supporting 1820 and by non-believers as supporting 1824.<ref>Manchester land assessment records show an increase in assessed value of the Smith property in 1823. Because the tax assessment of the Smiths' Manchester land rose in 1823, critics argue that the Smiths completed their Manchester cabin in 1822, which suggests an approximate date of 1824 for the First Vision. Joseph Smith, Sr. was first taxed for Manchester land in 1820. In 1821 and 1822, the land was valued at $700, but in 1823, the property was assessed at $1000, which may indicate \"that the Smiths had completed construction of their cabin and cleared a significant portion of their land\" {{harv|Vogel|2000|pp=443\u201344}}. In response, some Mormon apologists argue that in 1818, the Smiths mistakenly constructed a cabin 59 feet north of the actual property line (which would have been in Palmyra rather than Manchester) and the 1823 increase in the property assessment was related to the completion of a wood frame home on the Manchester side of the Palmyra\u2013Manchester township line. The latter interpretation would lend support for dating the First Vision to 1820 {{Harv|Ray|2002|pp=4\u20135}}. For a counter argument\u2014that there was a second cabin on the Smith property in Manchester\u2014see {{harvnb|Vogel|2000|pp=416\u201319}}. Vogel argues that based on archaeological and documentary evidence, the Manchester cabin was constructed prior to the Smiths' building of their frame home. \"To argue for the existence of only the Jennings cabin, which the Smiths inadvertently built on the Palmyra side of the township line, one must assume that the error was perpetuated not only by the Smiths but also by authorities in both counties. However, the existence of the names of Joseph Sr., Alvin, and Hyrum on the Palmyra road lists for 1820\u201322 strongly argues that both the Smiths and village authorities understood that the cabin was in Palmyra township.\"(419)</ref>\n\nIn the 1838 account Smith said that this vision occurred \"on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty.\"<ref>[[Joseph Smith\u2013History]] [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.14?lang=eng 1:14].</ref> Two Latter-day saints, researching weather reports and maple sugar production records, argue in a non-peer-reviewed magazine article that the most likely exact date for the First Vision was Palm Sunday, March 26, 1820.<ref>{{citation |title=Oh, How Lovely Was the Morning: Sun 26 Mar 1820? |work=[[Meridian Magazine]] |date=October 9, 2002 |first=John C. |last=Lefgren }}.

In the \"Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ,\" Smith recounted his early history, noting\n\n<blockquote>\"For, after that it truly was manifested unto [Smith] that he had received remission of his sins, he was entangled again in the vanities of the world, but after truly repenting, God visited him by an holy angel ... and gave unto him power, by the means which was before prepared that he should translate a book.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Howe|1831}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\nNo further explanation of this \"manifestation\" is provided.

Cheesman]], a graduate student at Brigham Young University. This is a handwritten manuscript apparently composed about 1833 and either written or dictated by Joseph Smith. It contains an account of the early experiences of the Mormon prophet and includes the story of the first vision. While the story varies in some details from the version presently accepted, enough is there to indicate that at least as early as 1833 Joseph Smith contemplated writing and perhaps publishing it. The manuscript has apparently lain in the L.D.S.

In 1952, General Authority [[Levi E. Young]] met with amateur historian LaMar Peterson and told him of a \"strange account\" in Joseph's handwriting that did not mention God the Father.  In 1964, Peterson told [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]] about the account, and they subsequently asked permission from Joseph Fielding Smith to see it, but were denied.

In one issue, Cowdery explained that Smith was confused by the different religions and local revivals during his \"15th year\" (1820), leading him to wonder which church was true. In the next issue of the biography, Cowdery explained that reference to Smith's \"15th year\" was a typographical error, and that actually the revivals and religious confusion took place in Smith's \"17th year.\"\n\nTherefore, according to Cowdery, the religious confusion led Smith to pray in his bedroom, late on the night of September 23, 1823, after the others had gone to sleep, to know which of the competing denominations was correct and whether \"a Supreme being did exist.\" In response, an angel appeared and granted him forgiveness of his sins. The remainder of the story roughly parallels Smith's later description of a visit by an angel in 1823 who told him about the [[golden plates]]. Thus, Cowdery's account, containing a single vision, differs from Smith's 1832 account, which contains two separate visions, one in 1821 prompted by religious confusion (the First Vision) and a separate one regarding the plates on September 22, 1822. Cowdery's account also differs from Smith's 1842 account, which includes a First Vision in 1820 and a second vision on September 22, 1823.\n\n===1835 Smith accounts===\nOn November 9, 1835, Smith dictated an account of the First Vision in his diary after telling it to a stranger<ref>The stranger was [[Robert Matthews (religious figure)|Robert Matthias]], a religious con-artist using the alias \"Joshua the Jewish minister\". Bushman, ''Rough Stone Rolling'', 275-76.</ref> who had visited his home earlier that day.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=22\u201324}}.</ref> Smith said that when perplexed about religions matters, he had gone to a grove to pray<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=23}}.</ref> but that his tongue seemed swollen in his mouth and that he had been interrupted twice by the sound of someone walking behind him.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=23\u201324}}.</ref> Finally, as he prayed, he said his tongue was loosed, and he saw a pillar of fire in which an unidentified \"personage\" appeared.<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\">{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=24}}.</ref> Then another unidentified personage told Smith his sins were forgiven and \"testified unto [Smith] that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> An interlineation in the text notes, \"and I saw many angels in this vision.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> Smith said this vision occurred when he was 14 years old and that when he was 17, he \"saw another vision of angels in the night season after I had retired to bed\" (referring to the later visit of the [[angel Moroni]] who showed him the location of the [[golden plates]]).<ref name=\"Smith 1835 24\"/> Smith identified none of these personages or angels with \"the Lord\" as he had in 1832.<ref>Abanes,{{specify|date=April 2012}} 16: [http://www.irr.org/mit/First-Vision-Scans/first-vision-1835A.html the 1835 account] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414033852/http://www.irr.org/mit/First-Vision-Scans/first-vision-1835A.html |date=April 14, 2005 }}{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2012}}. In 1835, Smith approved the \"[[Lectures on Faith]]\", an orderly presentation of Mormonism (probably written by [[Sidney Rigdon]]) in which it was taught that although Jesus Christ had a tangible body of flesh, God the Father was a spiritual presence\u2014a view not out of harmony with orthodox Christian belief. The \"Lectures on Faith\" were canonized by the LDS Church and included as part of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] until de-canonized after 1921. (Bushman,''Rough Stone Rolling'', 283\u201384.)</ref>\n\nA few days later, on November 14, 1835, Smith told the story to another visitor, Erastus Holmes.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|p=35}}.</ref> In his journal, Smith said that he had recited his life story \"up to the time I received the first visitation of angels, which was when I was about fourteen years old.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1835|pp=35\u201336}}. When LDS Church historian [[B. H. Roberts]] included this account into his ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''2''':312, he changed the words \"first visitation of angels\" to \"first vision.\"</ref>\n\n===1838 Smith account===\n\nIn 1838, Smith began dictating a history, introduced as \"I have been induced to write this history ... in relation both to myself and the Church.\"<ref>The original 1838 manuscript has been lost, but the account was copied to manuscripts dating from 1839, which indicates that the year of writing was 1838, a fact also confirmed by Smith's journal entries. See {{Harvtxt|Jessee|1969|pp=6\u20137}}.</ref> This history included a new account of the First Vision, later published in three issues of ''[[Times and Seasons]]''.<ref>''[[Times and Seasons]]'', March and April, vol. 3 nos. 9, 11.</ref> This version was later incorporated into the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]], which was canonized by the LDS Church in 1880, as [[Joseph Smith\u2013History]]. Thus, it is often called the [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng \"canonized version\"] of the First Vision story.\n\nThis version differs from the 1840 version because it includes the proclamation, \"This is My Beloved Son, hear Him\" from one of the personages, whereas the 1840 version does not. The canonized version says that in the spring of 1820, during a period of \"confusion and strife among the different denominations\" following an \"unusual excitement on the subject of religion\", Smith had debated which of the various Christian groups he should join. While in turmoil, he read from the [[Epistle of James]]: \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"<ref>James 1:5; [[Joseph Smith\u2013History]].</ref>\n\nOne morning, deeply impressed by this scripture, the fourteen-year-old Smith went to the woods near his home, knelt, and began his first vocal prayer. Almost immediately he was confronted by an evil power that prevented speech. A darkness gathered around him, and Smith believed that he would be destroyed. He continued the prayer silently, asking for God's assistance though still resigned to destruction. At this moment a light brighter than the sun descended towards him, and he was delivered from the evil power.\n\nIn the light, Smith \"saw two personages standing in the air\". One pointed to the other and said, \"This is My Beloved Son, hear Him.\" Smith asked which religious sect he should join and was told to join none of them because all existing religions had corrupted the teachings of Jesus Christ.<ref>''See'' [[Great Apostasy]].</ref>\n\nIn his 1838 account, Smith wrote that he made an oblique reference to the vision to his mother in 1820, telling her the day it happened that he had \"learned for [him]self that [[Presbyterian]]ism is not true.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Roberts|1902|loc=vol. 1, ch. 1, p. 6}}</ref> Lucy did not mention this conversation in her memoirs in her own words, but included the narrative from Joseph's 1838 account directly.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1853|p=78}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url= http://woodlandinstitute.com/joseph/first-vision/pubSeerPg5JosephSmith1838.php |title=The First Vision: 1838 Joseph Smith History Account |work=Woodland Institute |publisher=[[Richard N.

Porter, the Methodist minister, George Lane, may have passed very near the Smith home and preached at a camp meeting along the way in July 1820. \"In the pursuit of his ministerial duties Rev. Lane was in the geographical proximity of Joseph Smith on a number of occasions between the years 1819-1825. The nature degree or indeed the actuality of their acquaintanceship during this interval poses a number of interesting possibilities ....

Present records do not specify Lane's itinerary or exact route ... but they do for Lane's friend, Rev. George Peck .... [Peck's] conference route took him north to Ithaca, then on to a camp meeting in the Holland Purchase, subsequently passing along the Ridge Road to Rochester .... As Rev. Peck, [Lane] may even have stopped at a camp meeting somewhere along the way. A preacher of his standing would always be a welcome guest.\" {{harv|Porter|1969|p=335}}.

As a result, he said, he received immediate criticism in the community. There is little if any evidence, however, that by the early 1830s Joseph Smith was telling the story in public. At least if he were telling it, no one seemed to consider it important enough to have recorded it ''at the time'', and no one was criticizing him for it.\"</ref> None of the earliest [[anti-Mormonism|anti-Mormon]] literature mentioned the First Vision.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1966|p=31}}: \"Apparently not until 1843, when the ''New York Spectator'' printed a reporter's account of an interview with Joseph Smith, did a ''non-Mormon'' source publish any reference to the story of the first vision.\"</ref> Smith also said he told others about the vision during the 1820s, and some family members said that they had heard him mention it, but none prior to 1823, when Smith said he had his second vision.<ref>{{Harvnb|Palmer|2002|p=245}}: \"There is no evidence of prejudice resulting from this first vision.

In each case, God tells him to remain aloof from all Christian denominations, as something better is in store.\")</ref>\n\nSome believers view differences in the accounts as overstated. [[Richard L. Anderson]] wrote, \"What are the main problems of interpreting so many accounts? The first problem is the interpreter. One person perceives harmony and interconnections while another overstates differences.\"<ref name=\"Anderson\">\"One person perceives harmony and interconnections while another overstates differences. Think of how you retell a vivid event in your life\u2014marriage, first day on the job, or an automobile accident. A record of all your comments would include short and long versions, along with many bits and pieces. Only by blending these glimpses can an outsider reconstruct what originally happened. The biggest trap is comparing description in one report with silence in another. By assuming that what is not said is not known, some come up with arbitrary theories of an evolution in the Prophet's story. Yet we often omit parts of an episode because of the chance of the moment, not having time to tell everything, or deliberately stressing only a part of the original event in a particular situation. This means that any First Vision account contains some fraction of the whole experience. Combining all reliable reports will recreate the basics of Joseph Smith's quest and conversation with the Father and Son.\"{{Harv|Anderson|1996}}</ref> Other believers view the differences in the accounts as reflective of Smith's increase in maturity and knowledge over time.<ref>\"I've actually studied the various accounts of Joseph's First Vision, and I'm struck by the difference in his recountings.

Early adherents were unaware of the details of the vision until 1840, when the earliest accounts were published in [[Great Britain]]. An account of the First Vision was not published in the United States until 1842, shortly before [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]]. [[Jan Shipps]] has written that the vision was \"practically unknown\" until an account of it was published in 1842.<ref>{{harvnb|Shipps|1985|p=30}}. The first extant account of the First Vision is the manuscript account in Joseph Smith, \"Manuscript History of the Church\" (1839); the first published account is Orson Pratt, \"An Interesting Account of Several Remarkable Visions and of the Late Discovery of Ancient American Records\" (Edinburgh: Ballantyne and Hughes, 1840); and the first American publication is Smith's letter to John Wentworth in ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' '''3''' (March 1842): 706\u201308, only two years before Smith's assassination.

Palmer, a retired LDS religious instructor was [[Excommunication (LDS Church)|disfellowshipped]] by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after publishing this book. Palmer concludes his chapter, \"The 1832 account describes Joseph's experience most accurately. Smith's 1832 description does not forbid him from joining a church, nor does it mention a revival or persecution. Instead, he became convicted of his sins from reading the scriptures and received forgiveness from the Savior in a personal epiphany. He stated that his call to God's work came in 1823 from an angel, later identified as Moroni. When a crisis developed around the Book of Mormon in 1838, he conflated several events into one. Now he was called by God the Father and Jesus Christ in 1820 during an extended revival, was forbidden to join any existing church, and was greatly persecuted by institutions and individuals for sharing his vision of God. This version is not supported by historical evidence.\" (253\u201354)</ref>\n\nLeaders of the LDS Church have acknowledged that the First Vision as well as the [[Book of Mormon]] and Smith himself constitute \"stumbling blocks for many.\" [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Neal A. Maxwell]] wrote:\n<blockquote>In our own time, Joseph Smith, the First Vision, and the Book of Mormon constitute stumbling blocks for many\u2014around which they cannot get\u2014unless they are meek enough to examine all the evidence at hand, not being exclusionary as a result of accumulated attitudes in a secular society. Humbleness of mind is the initiator of expansiveness of mind.<ref>Neal A. Maxwell, ''Meek and Lowly'' (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Company, 1987) p. 76.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a 2007 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary, [[Richard Mouw]], an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Theology|theologian]] and student of Mormonism, summarized his feelings about the First Vision:\n<blockquote>My instinct is to attribute a sincerity to Joseph Smith. And yet at the same time, as an evangelical Christian, I do not believe that the members of the godhead really appeared to him and told him that he should start on a mission of, among other things, denouncing the kinds of things that I believe as a Presbyterian. I can't believe that. And yet at the same time, I really don't believe that he was simply making up a story that he knew to be false in order to manipulate people and to gain power over a religious movement. And so I live with the mystery.<ref>{{citation |contribution-url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/etc/script.html |contribution=Part One (Night One Transcript) |title=The Mormons |author=''[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]'' and ''[[American Experience]]'' |editor=[[Helen Whitney]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]|title-link=The Mormons (film) }}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==Side by Side Comparison of Joseph Smith Vision Accounts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | Summer 1832 History<ref>\"History, circa Summer 1832,\" p. 1, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-summer-1832/1</ref> \n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | November 1835 Journal<ref>\"Journal, 1835\u20131836,\" p. 23, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/journal-1835-1836/24</ref> \n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | 1838 History<ref>\"History, circa June 1839\u2013circa 1841 [Draft 2],\" p. 2, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-circa-june-1839-circa-1841-draft-2/2</ref> \n! style=\"width: 25%;\" | 1842 Wentworth Letter<ref>\"\u201cChurch History,\u201d 1 March 1842,\" p. 706, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed February 23, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/church-history-1-march-1842/1</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | My mind became exceedingly distressed, for I became convicted of my sins, and by searching the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatized from the true and living faith, and there was no society or denomination that was built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament. I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world, for I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday, today, and forever, that he was no respecter of persons, for he was God.\n|  style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | \nBeing wrought up in my mind respecting the subject of religion, and looking at the different systems taught the children of men, I knew not who was right or who was wrong. \n|  style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | \nMy mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant. The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists, and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were in error. On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and disprove all others.\n\nIn the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be aright, which is it, and how shall I know it?\n\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | When about fourteen years of age, I began to reflect upon the importance of being prepared for a future state, and upon enquiring about the plan of salvation, I found that there was a great clash in religious sentiment; if I went to one society, they referred me to one plan, and another to another, each one pointing to his own particular creed as the summum bonum of perfection. Considering that all could not be right, and that God could not be the author of so much confusion, I determined to investigate the subject more fully, believing that if God had a church it would not be split up into factions, and that if he taught one society to worship one way, and administer in one set of ordinances, he would not teach another principles which were diametrically opposed. \n\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | For I looked upon the sun, the glorious luminary of the earth, and also the moon, rolling in their majesty through the heavens, and also the stars shining in their courses, and the earth also upon which I stood, and the beasts of the \ufb01eld, and the fowls of heaven, and the \ufb01sh of the waters, and also man walking forth upon the face of the earth in majesty and in the strength of beauty, whose power and intelligence in governing the things which are so exceedingly great and marvelous, even in the likeness of him who created them. And when I considered upon these things, my heart exclaimed, \u201cWell hath the wise man said, \u2018It is a fool that saith in his heart, there is no God.\u2019\u201d My heart exclaimed, \u201cAll, all these bear testimony and bespeak an omnipotent and omnipresent power, a being who maketh laws and decreeth and bindeth all things in their bounds, who \ufb01lleth eternity, who was and is and will be from all eternity to eternity.\u201d And I considered all these things and that that being seeketh such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nAnd considering it of the first importance that I should be right in matters that involve eternal consequences, being thus perplexed in mind I retired to the silent grove and bowed down before the Lord, under a realizing sense that he had said (if the Bible be true), \u201cAsk, and you shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened; seek, and you shall find,\u201d and again, \u201cIf any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\u201d  Information was what I most desired at this time, and with a fixed determination to obtain it, \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nWhile I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\n\nNever did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.\n\nAt length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to \u201cask of God,\u201d concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nBelieving the word of God, I had confidence in the declaration of James; \u201cIf any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him.\u201d\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| Therefore, I cried unto the Lord for mercy, for there was none else to whom I could go and obtain mercy.  And the Lord heard my cry in the wilderness, and while in the attitude of calling upon the Lord, in the sixteenth year of my age,\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| I called upon the Lord for the first time in the place above stated. Or in other words, I made a fruitless attempt to pray; my tongue seemed to be swollen in my mouth, so that I could not utter. I heard a noise behind me, like some person walking towards me. I strove again to pray but could not. The noise of walking seemed to draw nearer. I sprung up on my feet and looked around but saw no person or thing that was calculated to produce the noise of walking.\n\nI kneeled again. My mouth was opened and my tongue liberated, and I called on the Lord in mighty prayer. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nSo, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally.\n\nAfter I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.  But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction\u2014not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being\u2014just at this moment of great alarm,\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \nI retired to a secret place in a grove and began to call upon the Lord.  While fervently engaged in supplication, my mind was taken away from the objects with which I was surrounded, \n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | a pillar of light above the brightness of the sun at noonday came down from above and rested upon me. I was \ufb01lled with the spirit of God, and the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| A pillar of fire appeared above my head. It presently rested down upon me and filled me with joy unspeakable. A personage appeared in the midst of this pillar of flame, which was spread all around and yet nothing consumed. Another personage soon appeared, like unto the first. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|  I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.\n\nIt no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other\u2014This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"|  and I was enwrapped in a heavenly vision and saw two glorious personages who exactly resembled each other in features and likeness, surrounded with a brilliant light which eclipsed the sun at noonday. \n\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | And he spake unto me, saying, \u201cJoseph, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way, walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of glory. I was crucified for the world, that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life. Behold, the world lieth in sin at this time, and none doeth good, no, not one. They have turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments. They draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me. And mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth, to visit them according to their ungodliness and to bring to pass that which hath been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and apostles. Behold and lo, I come quickly, as it is written of me, in the cloud, clothed in the glory of my Father.\u201d\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| He said unto me, \u201cThy sins are forgiven thee.\u201d He testified unto me that Jesus Christ is the son of God. And I saw many angels in this vision.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)\u2014and which I should join.\n\nI was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that: \u201cthey draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof.\u201d\n\nHe again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time. When I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up into heaven. \n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| They told me that all religious denominations were believing in incorrect doctrines and that none of them was acknowledged of God as his church and kingdom. And I was expressly commanded to \u201cgo not after them,\u201d at the same time receiving a promise that the fulness of the gospel should at some future time be made known unto me.\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | My soul was \ufb01lled with love, and for many days I could rejoice with great joy. The Lord was with me, but I could \ufb01nd none that would believe the heavenly vision. Nevertheless, I pondered these things in my heart.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| I was about fourteen years old when I received this first communication.\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon recovering in some degree, I went home. And as I leaned up to the fireplace, mother inquired what the matter was. I replied, \u201cNever mind, all is well\u2014I am well enough off.\u201d I then said to my mother, \u201cI have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true.\u201d It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?\n|style=\"vertical-align: top;\"| \n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Allen\n | first = James B.\n | author-link = James B.

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most recognisable Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behaviour sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again.

He executed designs for a number of ballets including ''Labyrinth'' (1942), ''Sentimental Colloquy'', ''Mad Tristan'', and ''The Cafe of Chinitas'' (all 1944).<ref name=\":1\">Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 431-43</ref> In 1945 he created the dream sequence for Alfred Hitchcock's film ''Spellbound''.<ref name=\":2\">Gibson, Ian (1997) p 434-45</ref> He also produced art work and designs for products such as perfumes, cosmetics, hosiery and ties.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 430-31</ref>\n\n====== Post War in United States (1946-48) ======\nIn 1946 Dal\u00ed worked with Walt Disney and animator John Hench on an unfinished animated film ''[[Destino]]''.<ref name=\":3\">Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 436-38</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed exhibited new work at the Bignou Gallery from November 1947 to January 1948. The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''. The proportions of the latter work were worked out in collaboration with a mathematician.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 440-42</ref>\n\nIn early 1948 Dal\u00ed's ''50 Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship'' was published.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was charged with assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting. In 1949 he painted a study for ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and showed it to Pope Pius XII during an audience arranged to discuss his marriage to Gala.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 450-53</ref> This work was a precursor to the phase Dal\u00ed dubbed \"Nuclear Mysticism,\" a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism and Catholic mysticism.  In paintings such as ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]],'' ''[[Christ of Saint John of the Cross|The Christ of Saint John on the Cross]]'' and ''[[The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory]],'' Dal\u00ed sought to synthesize Christian [[iconography]] with images of material disintegration inspired by [[nuclear physics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|title=Salvador Dal\u00ed Bio, Art on 5th|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504050531/http://www.arton5th.com/Dali/bio.html|archive-date=4 May 2006|access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 461-63</ref> His later Nuclear Mysticism works included ''[[La Gare de Perpignan]]'' (1965) and ''[[The Hallucinogenic Toreador]]'' (1968\u201370).\n\nDal\u00ed's keen interest in natural science and [[mathematics and art|mathematics]] was further manifested by the proliferation of images of DNA and [[rhinoceros horn]] shapes in works from the mid-1950s.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

Some are in ruin from wear and tear, while others have been lost entirely. The Egyptian structures are among the largest constructions ever conceived and built by humans. They constitute one of the most potent and enduring symbols of Ancient Egyptian civilization. Temples and tombs built by a pharaoh famous for her projects, [[Hatshepsut]], were massive and included many colossal statues of her. Pharaoh [[Tutankamun]]'s rock-cut tomb in the Valley of the Kings was full of jewelry and antiques. In some late myths, [[Ptah]] was identified as the primordial mound and had called creation into being, he was considered the deity of craftsmen, and in particular, of stone-based crafts. [[Imhotep]], who was included in the [[Egyptian pantheon]], was the first documented engineer.<ref>{{cite we\nurl=http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/history_engineering.htm |title=What is Civil Engineering: Imhotep |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112195627/http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/history_engineering.htm |archivedate=2008-01-12 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:PHAROS2006.jpg|thumb|right|222px|The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] on the island of Pharos.]]\nIn [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Hellenistic Egypt]], [[lighthouse]] technology was developed, the most famous example being the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]]. Alexandria was a port for the ships that traded the goods manufactured in Egypt or imported into Egypt. A giant cantilevered hoist lifted cargo to and from ships. The lighthouse itself was designed by [[Sostratus of Cnidus]] and built in the 3rd century BC (between 285 and 247&nbsp;BC) on the island of Pharos in [[Alexandria, Egypt]], which has since become a peninsula. This lighthouse was renowned in its time and knowledge of it was never lost. A 2006 drawing of it created from the study of many references, is shown at the right.\n\n====Monuments====\n{{main|Egyptian pyramids|Egyptian pyramid construction techniques}}\nThe Nile valley has been the site of one of the most influential [[civilization]]s in the world with its architectural monuments, which include the [[pyramids of Giza]] and the [[Great Sphinx]]\u2014among the largest and most famous buildings in the world.\n\n[[File:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg|222px|thumb|Giza Plateau, Cairo. Khafre's pyramid in the background]]\nThe most famous [[pyramid]]s are the [[Egyptian pyramids]]\u2014huge structures built of brick or stone, some of which are among the largest constructions by humans. Pyramids functioned as [[tomb]]s for [[pharaoh]]s. In Ancient Egypt, a pyramid was referred to as ''mer'', literally \"place of ascendance.\" The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] is the largest in Egypt and one of the largest in the world. The base is over {{convert|13|acre|m2}} in area. It is one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]], and the only one of the seven to survive into modern times. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians capped the peaks of their pyramids with gold and covered their faces with polished white limestone, although many of the stones used for the finishing purpose have fallen or been removed for use on other structures over the millennia.\n\nThe [[Red Pyramid]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] (c.26th century BC), named for the light crimson hue of its exposed granite surfaces, is the third largest of [[Egyptian pyramids]]. [[Menkaure's Pyramid]], likely dating to the same era, was constructed of [[limestone]] and granite blocks. The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (c. [[26th century BC|2580 BC]]) contains a huge granite [[sarcophagus]] fashioned of \"Red [[Aswan]] Granite.\" The mostly ruined [[Black Pyramid]] dating from the reign of [[Amenemhat III]] once had a polished granite [[pyramidion]] or capstone, now on display in the main hall of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]] (see [[Dahshur]]). Other uses in [[Ancient Egypt]],<ref>[http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/Harrell/Egypt/Mosques/CAIRO_Rocks_1.htm eeescience utoledo.edu : Cairo Rocks]</ref> include [[column]]s, door [[lintel]]s, [[Sill plate|sill]]s, [[jamb]]s, and wall and floor [[wiktionary:veneer|veneer]].\n\nThe ancient Egyptians had some of the first monumental stone buildings (such as in [[Sakkara]]). How the [[Egyptians]] worked the solid [[granite]] is still a matter of debate. Archaeologist [[Patrick Hunt (archeologist)|Patrick Hunt]]<ref>[http://hebsed.home.comcast.net/hunt.htm Arce/Nc Archives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014031747/http://hebsed.home.comcast.net/hunt.htm |date=October 14, 2007 }}</ref> has postulated that the Egyptians used [[Emery (mineral)|emery]] shown to have higher [[Hardenability|hardness]] on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Regarding construction, of the various methods possibly used by builders, the [[lever]] moved and uplifted [[obelisk]]s weighing more than 100 [[Tonne|tons]].\n\n====Obelisks and pillars====\n[[Obelisk]]s were a prominent part of the architecture of the ancient Egyptians, who placed them in pairs at the entrances of various monuments and important buildings, such as temples. In 1902, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica wrote, \"The earliest temple obelisk still in position is that of [[Senusret I]] of the XIIth Dynasty at Heliopolis (68&nbsp;feet high)\". The word \"obelisk\" is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because Herodotus, the great traveler, was the first writer to describe the objects. Twenty-nine ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the ''unfinished obelisk'' being built by [[Hatshepsut]] to celebrate her sixteenth year as pharaoh. It broke while being carved out of the quarry and was abandoned when another one was begun to replace it. The broken one was found at Aswan and provides the only insight into the methods of how they were hewn. The obelisk symbolized the sky deity [[Ra]] and during the brief religious reformation of Akhenaten, was said to be a petrified ray of the Aten, the sun disk. It is hypothesized by [[New York University]] [[Egyptologist]] Patricia Blackwell Gary and ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'' senior editor Richard Talcott that the shapes of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pyramid]] and Obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the [[sun]] (the sun-god [[Ra]] being the Egyptians' greatest deity).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Patricia Blackwell Gary |author2=Richard Talcott |title=Stargazing in Ancient Egypt |journal=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |pages=62\u20137 |date=June 2006 }}</ref> It was also thought that the deity existed within the structure. The Egyptians also used [[Column|pillar]]s extensively.\n\nIt is unknown whether the Ancient Egyptians had [[kite]]s, but a team led by Maureen Clemmons and Mory Gharib raised a 5,900-pound, {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} obelisk into vertical position with a kite, a system of pulleys, and a support frame.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web |url=http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12164.html |title=Caltech researchers successfully raised an obelisk with a kite to test theory about ancient pyramids |access-date=2007-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328212434/http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12164.html |archive-date=2007-03-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Maureen Clemmons developed the idea that the ancient Egyptians used kites for work.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Ramps have been reported as being widely used in Ancient Egypt. A ramp is an inclined plane, or a plane surface set at an angle (other than a right angle) against a horizontal surface. The inclined plane permits one to overcome a large resistance by applying a relatively small force through a longer distance than the load is to be raised. In civil engineering the slope (ratio of rise/run) is often referred to as a grade or gradient. An inclined plane is one of the commonly-recognized simple machines. Maureen Clemmons subsequently led a team of researchers demonstrating a kite made of natural material and reinforced with shellac (which according to their research pulled with 97% the efficiency of nylon), in a 9&nbsp;mph wind, would easily pull an average 2-ton pyramid stone up the 1st two courses of a pyramid (in collaboration with Cal Poly, Pomona, on a 53-stone pyramid built in Rosamond, CA). \n[[File:Wells egyptian ship red sea.png|thumb|222px|Egyptian ship, 1250&nbsp;B.C.

They were made by winding molten glass around a metal bar and were highly prized as a trading commodity, especially blue beads, which were believed to have magical powers. The [[Egyptians]] made small jars and bottles using the core-formed method. Glass threads were wound around a bag of sand tied to a rod. The glass was continually reheated to fuse the threads together. The glass-covered sand bag was kept in motion until the required shape and thickness was achieved. The rod was allowed to cool, then finally the bag was punctured and the sand poured out and reused . The Egyptians also created the first colored glass rods which they used to create colorful beads and decorations. They also worked with cast glass, which was produced by pouring molten glass into a mold, much like [[iron]] and the more modern [[crucible steel]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/arts_and_crafts/Susan_Hampton/Roman_Glass.html#Origin%20Myth| title = Glassmaking in Antiquity| accessdate = 2007-03-21| author = Susan Hampton| publisher = The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405113459/http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/arts_and_crafts/Susan_Hampton/Roman_Glass.html| archivedate= 5 April 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Astronomy===\n{{main|Egyptian astronomy}}\n{{related|[[Egyptian calendar]]|[[Archaeoastronomy]]}}\nThe Egyptians were a practical people and this is reflected in their astronomy<ref>Ronald A Wells, \"Archaeoastronomy in Egypt\", in Walker, Christopher, Ed ''Astronomy before the telescope'', British Museum Press, 1996 p.28</ref> in contrast to Babylonia where the first astronomical texts were written in astrological terms.<ref>John Britton and Christopher Walker, Astrology and Astronomy in Mesopotamia, in Walker, Christopher, Ed ''Astronomy before the telescope'', British Museum Press, 1996 p. 42</ref> Even before Upper and Lower Egypt were unified in 3000 BCE, observations of the night sky had influenced the development of a religion in which many of its principal deities were heavenly bodies. In Lower Egypt, priests built circular mud-brick walls with which to make a false horizon where they could mark the position of the sun as it rose at dawn, and then with a plumb-bob note the northern or southern turning points (solstices). This allowed them to discover that the sun disc, personified as Ra, took 365 days to travel from his birthplace at the winter solstice and back to it. Meanwhile, in Upper Egypt a lunar calendar was being developed based on the behavior of the moon and the reappearance of [[Sirius]] in its [[heliacal rising]] after its annual absence of about 70 days.<ref>Tyldesley, Joyce, Pyramids: The Real Story Behind Egypt's Ancient Monuments, Viking, 2003, p. 74</ref>\n\nAfter unification, problems with trying to work with two calendars (both depending upon constant observation) led to a merged, simplified civil calendar with twelve 30-day months, three seasons of four months each, plus an extra five days, giving a 365-year day but with no way of accounting for the extra quarter day each year. Day and night were split into 24 units, each personified by a deity. A sundial found on Seti I's cenotaph with instructions for its use shows us that the daylight hours were at one time split into 10 units, with 12 hours for the night and an hour for the morning and evening twilights.<ref>{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto E.

Out of Egyptian myths such as those around Ra and the sky goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] came the development of the [[Egyptian calendar]], time keeping, and even concepts of royalty. An astronomical ceiling in the burial chamber of [[Ramesses VI]] shows the sun being born from Nut in the morning, traveling along her body during the day and being swallowed at night.\n\nDuring the [[Fifth Dynasty]] six kings built sun temples in honour of Ra. The temple complexes built by [[Niuserre]] at [[Abu Gurab]] and [[Userkaf]] at [[Abusir]] have been excavated and have astronomical alignments, and the roofs of some of the buildings could have been used by observers to view the stars, calculate the hours at night and predict the sunrise for religious festivals.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n[[File:Dendera.jpg|222px|thumb|The [[Dendera Zodiac]] was on the ceiling of the Greco-Roman temple of Hathor at Dendera]]\n\nClaims have been made that [[precession of the equinoxes]] was known in [[Ancient Egypt]] prior to the time of [[Hipparchus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=De Santillana |first=G. |last2=Von Dechend |first2=H. |title=Hamlet's Mill |year=1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ql7ATHGee50C |publisher=David R.

For instance, from the Middle Kingdom onwards they used a table with entries for each month to tell the time of night from the passing of constellations. These went in error after a few centuries because of their calendar and precession, but were copied (with scribal errors) long after they lost their practical usefulness or the possibility of understanding and use of them in the current years, rather than the years in which they were originally used.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian medicine}}\nThe [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document which attempts to describe and analyze the brain: given this, it might be seen as the very beginnings of [[neuroscience]].

Papyrus was produced in Egypt as early as 3000&nbsp; BC, and was sold to ancient [[Greece]] and [[Rome]]. The establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]] limited the supply of papyrus for others. According to the Roman historian [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] ([[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] records, xiii.21), as a result of this, [[parchment]] was invented under the patronage of [[Eumenes II of Pergamon]] to build his rival library at [[Pergamon]]. However, this is a myth; parchment had been in use in Anatolia and elsewhere long before the rise of Pergamon.\n\n[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], a [[phonetic]] [[writing system]], served as the basis for the [[Phoenician alphabet]] from which later alphabets, such as Hebrew, Greek, and Latin were derived. With this ability, writing and record-keeping, the Egyptians developed one of the \u2014if not ''the''\u2014 first [[Decimal|decimal system]].<ref>Georges Ifrah, The Universal History of Numbers.

According to Lucas and Harris, \u201creeds were plastered with clay in order to keep out of heat and cold more effectually\u201d.<ref>A. Lucas and J. Harris, \"Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries\" (New York: Courier Corporation, 2012), 48.</ref> Other tools that were used were \"limestone, chiseled stones, wooden mallets, and stone hammers\".<ref>A.

Some are in ruin from wear and tear, while others have been lost entirely. The Egyptian structures are among the largest constructions ever conceived and built by humans. They constitute one of the most potent and enduring symbols of Ancient Egyptian civilization. Temples and tombs built by a pharaoh famous for her projects, [[Hatshepsut]], were massive and included many colossal statues of her. Pharaoh [[Tutankamun]]'s rock-cut tomb in the Valley of the Kings was full of jewelry and antiques. In some late myths, [[Ptah]] was identified as the primordial mound and had called creation into being, he was considered the deity of craftsmen, and in particular, of stone-based crafts. [[Imhotep]], who was included in the [[Egyptian pantheon]], was the first documented engineer.<ref>{{cite we\nurl=http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/history_engineering.htm |title=What is Civil Engineering: Imhotep |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112195627/http://whatiscivilengineering.csce.ca/history_engineering.htm |archivedate=2008-01-12 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:PHAROS2006.jpg|thumb|right|222px|The [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] on the island of Pharos.]]\nIn [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Hellenistic Egypt]], [[lighthouse]] technology was developed, the most famous example being the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]]. Alexandria was a port for the ships that traded the goods manufactured in Egypt or imported into Egypt. A giant cantilevered hoist lifted cargo to and from ships. The lighthouse itself was designed by [[Sostratus of Cnidus]] and built in the 3rd century BC (between 285 and 247&nbsp;BC) on the island of Pharos in [[Alexandria, Egypt]], which has since become a peninsula. This lighthouse was renowned in its time and knowledge of it was never lost. A 2006 drawing of it created from the study of many references, is shown at the right.\n\n====Monuments====\n{{main|Egyptian pyramids|Egyptian pyramid construction techniques}}\nThe Nile valley has been the site of one of the most influential [[civilization]]s in the world with its architectural monuments, which include the [[pyramids of Giza]] and the [[Great Sphinx]]\u2014among the largest and most famous buildings in the world.\n\n[[File:Egypt.Giza.Sphinx.01.jpg|222px|thumb|Giza Plateau, Cairo. Khafre's pyramid in the background]]\nThe most famous [[pyramid]]s are the [[Egyptian pyramids]]\u2014huge structures built of brick or stone, some of which are among the largest constructions by humans. Pyramids functioned as [[tomb]]s for [[pharaoh]]s. In Ancient Egypt, a pyramid was referred to as ''mer'', literally \"place of ascendance.\" The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] is the largest in Egypt and one of the largest in the world. The base is over {{convert|13|acre|m2}} in area. It is one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]], and the only one of the seven to survive into modern times. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians capped the peaks of their pyramids with gold and covered their faces with polished white limestone, although many of the stones used for the finishing purpose have fallen or been removed for use on other structures over the millennia.\n\nThe [[Red Pyramid]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] (c.26th century BC), named for the light crimson hue of its exposed granite surfaces, is the third largest of [[Egyptian pyramids]]. [[Menkaure's Pyramid]], likely dating to the same era, was constructed of [[limestone]] and granite blocks. The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (c. [[26th century BC|2580 BC]]) contains a huge granite [[sarcophagus]] fashioned of \"Red [[Aswan]] Granite.\" The mostly ruined [[Black Pyramid]] dating from the reign of [[Amenemhat III]] once had a polished granite [[pyramidion]] or capstone, now on display in the main hall of the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]] (see [[Dahshur]]). Other uses in [[Ancient Egypt]],<ref>[http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/Harrell/Egypt/Mosques/CAIRO_Rocks_1.htm eeescience utoledo.edu : Cairo Rocks]</ref> include [[column]]s, door [[lintel]]s, [[Sill plate|sill]]s, [[jamb]]s, and wall and floor [[wiktionary:veneer|veneer]].\n\nThe ancient Egyptians had some of the first monumental stone buildings (such as in [[Sakkara]]). How the [[Egyptians]] worked the solid [[granite]] is still a matter of debate. Archaeologist [[Patrick Hunt (archeologist)|Patrick Hunt]]<ref>[http://hebsed.home.comcast.net/hunt.htm Arce/Nc Archives] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014031747/http://hebsed.home.comcast.net/hunt.htm |date=October 14, 2007 }}</ref> has postulated that the Egyptians used [[Emery (mineral)|emery]] shown to have higher [[Hardenability|hardness]] on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Regarding construction, of the various methods possibly used by builders, the [[lever]] moved and uplifted [[obelisk]]s weighing more than 100 [[Tonne|tons]].\n\n====Obelisks and pillars====\n[[Obelisk]]s were a prominent part of the architecture of the ancient Egyptians, who placed them in pairs at the entrances of various monuments and important buildings, such as temples. In 1902, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica wrote, \"The earliest temple obelisk still in position is that of [[Senusret I]] of the XIIth Dynasty at Heliopolis (68&nbsp;feet high)\". The word \"obelisk\" is of Greek rather than Egyptian origin because Herodotus, the great traveler, was the first writer to describe the objects. Twenty-nine ancient Egyptian obelisks are known to have survived, plus the ''unfinished obelisk'' being built by [[Hatshepsut]] to celebrate her sixteenth year as pharaoh. It broke while being carved out of the quarry and was abandoned when another one was begun to replace it. The broken one was found at Aswan and provides the only insight into the methods of how they were hewn. The obelisk symbolized the sky deity [[Ra]] and during the brief religious reformation of Akhenaten, was said to be a petrified ray of the Aten, the sun disk. It is hypothesized by [[New York University]] [[Egyptologist]] Patricia Blackwell Gary and ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'' senior editor Richard Talcott that the shapes of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pyramid]] and Obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the [[sun]] (the sun-god [[Ra]] being the Egyptians' greatest deity).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Patricia Blackwell Gary |author2=Richard Talcott |title=Stargazing in Ancient Egypt |journal=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |pages=62\u20137 |date=June 2006 }}</ref> It was also thought that the deity existed within the structure. The Egyptians also used [[Column|pillar]]s extensively.\n\nIt is unknown whether the Ancient Egyptians had [[kite]]s, but a team led by Maureen Clemmons and Mory Gharib raised a 5,900-pound, {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} obelisk into vertical position with a kite, a system of pulleys, and a support frame.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web |url=http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12164.html |title=Caltech researchers successfully raised an obelisk with a kite to test theory about ancient pyramids |access-date=2007-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328212434/http://pr.caltech.edu/media/Press_Releases/PR12164.html |archive-date=2007-03-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Maureen Clemmons developed the idea that the ancient Egyptians used kites for work.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Ramps have been reported as being widely used in Ancient Egypt. A ramp is an inclined plane, or a plane surface set at an angle (other than a right angle) against a horizontal surface. The inclined plane permits one to overcome a large resistance by applying a relatively small force through a longer distance than the load is to be raised. In civil engineering the slope (ratio of rise/run) is often referred to as a grade or gradient. An inclined plane is one of the commonly-recognized simple machines. Maureen Clemmons subsequently led a team of researchers demonstrating a kite made of natural material and reinforced with shellac (which according to their research pulled with 97% the efficiency of nylon), in a 9&nbsp;mph wind, would easily pull an average 2-ton pyramid stone up the 1st two courses of a pyramid (in collaboration with Cal Poly, Pomona, on a 53-stone pyramid built in Rosamond, CA). \n[[File:Wells egyptian ship red sea.png|thumb|222px|Egyptian ship, 1250&nbsp;B.C.

They were made by winding molten glass around a metal bar and were highly prized as a trading commodity, especially blue beads, which were believed to have magical powers. The [[Egyptians]] made small jars and bottles using the core-formed method. Glass threads were wound around a bag of sand tied to a rod. The glass was continually reheated to fuse the threads together. The glass-covered sand bag was kept in motion until the required shape and thickness was achieved. The rod was allowed to cool, then finally the bag was punctured and the sand poured out and reused . The Egyptians also created the first colored glass rods which they used to create colorful beads and decorations. They also worked with cast glass, which was produced by pouring molten glass into a mold, much like [[iron]] and the more modern [[crucible steel]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/arts_and_crafts/Susan_Hampton/Roman_Glass.html#Origin%20Myth| title = Glassmaking in Antiquity| accessdate = 2007-03-21| author = Susan Hampton| publisher = The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070405113459/http://www.unc.edu/courses/rometech/public/content/arts_and_crafts/Susan_Hampton/Roman_Glass.html| archivedate= 5 April 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Astronomy===\n{{main|Egyptian astronomy}}\n{{related|[[Egyptian calendar]]|[[Archaeoastronomy]]}}\nThe Egyptians were a practical people and this is reflected in their astronomy<ref>Ronald A Wells, \"Archaeoastronomy in Egypt\", in Walker, Christopher, Ed ''Astronomy before the telescope'', British Museum Press, 1996 p.28</ref> in contrast to Babylonia where the first astronomical texts were written in astrological terms.<ref>John Britton and Christopher Walker, Astrology and Astronomy in Mesopotamia, in Walker, Christopher, Ed ''Astronomy before the telescope'', British Museum Press, 1996 p. 42</ref> Even before Upper and Lower Egypt were unified in 3000 BCE, observations of the night sky had influenced the development of a religion in which many of its principal deities were heavenly bodies. In Lower Egypt, priests built circular mud-brick walls with which to make a false horizon where they could mark the position of the sun as it rose at dawn, and then with a plumb-bob note the northern or southern turning points (solstices). This allowed them to discover that the sun disc, personified as Ra, took 365 days to travel from his birthplace at the winter solstice and back to it. Meanwhile, in Upper Egypt a lunar calendar was being developed based on the behavior of the moon and the reappearance of [[Sirius]] in its [[heliacal rising]] after its annual absence of about 70 days.<ref>Tyldesley, Joyce, Pyramids: The Real Story Behind Egypt's Ancient Monuments, Viking, 2003, p. 74</ref>\n\nAfter unification, problems with trying to work with two calendars (both depending upon constant observation) led to a merged, simplified civil calendar with twelve 30-day months, three seasons of four months each, plus an extra five days, giving a 365-year day but with no way of accounting for the extra quarter day each year. Day and night were split into 24 units, each personified by a deity. A sundial found on Seti I's cenotaph with instructions for its use shows us that the daylight hours were at one time split into 10 units, with 12 hours for the night and an hour for the morning and evening twilights.<ref>{{Cite book | edition = 2 | publisher = [[Dover Publications]] | last = Neugebauer | first = Otto | author-link = Otto E.

Out of Egyptian myths such as those around Ra and the sky goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]] came the development of the [[Egyptian calendar]], time keeping, and even concepts of royalty. An astronomical ceiling in the burial chamber of [[Ramesses VI]] shows the sun being born from Nut in the morning, traveling along her body during the day and being swallowed at night.\n\nDuring the [[Fifth Dynasty]] six kings built sun temples in honour of Ra. The temple complexes built by [[Niuserre]] at [[Abu Gurab]] and [[Userkaf]] at [[Abusir]] have been excavated and have astronomical alignments, and the roofs of some of the buildings could have been used by observers to view the stars, calculate the hours at night and predict the sunrise for religious festivals.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n[[File:Dendera.jpg|222px|thumb|The [[Dendera Zodiac]] was on the ceiling of the Greco-Roman temple of Hathor at Dendera]]\n\nClaims have been made that [[precession of the equinoxes]] was known in [[Ancient Egypt]] prior to the time of [[Hipparchus]].<ref>{{cite book |last=De Santillana |first=G. |last2=Von Dechend |first2=H. |title=Hamlet's Mill |year=1977 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ql7ATHGee50C |publisher=David R.

Fagan|page=123|chapter=Esoteric Egypt}}</ref>\n\nNote however that the Egyptian observation of a slowly changing stellar alignment over a multi-year period does not necessarily mean that they understood or even cared what was going on. For instance, from the Middle Kingdom onwards they used a table with entries for each month to tell the time of night from the passing of constellations. These went in error after a few centuries because of their calendar and precession, but were copied (with scribal errors) long after they lost their practical usefulness or the possibility of understanding and use of them in the current years, rather than the years in which they were originally used.\n\n===Medicine===\n{{main|Ancient Egyptian medicine}}\nThe [[Edwin Smith Papyrus]] is one of the first medical documents still extant, and perhaps the earliest document which attempts to describe and analyze the brain: given this, it might be seen as the very beginnings of [[neuroscience]].

The sound design for ''[[Backdraft (film)|Backdraft]]'', prepared from scratch, would become the precursor for his sound for ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.

Rydstrom also worked with ''Terminator 2'' director [[James Cameron]] on a new 5.1 surround mix for the original ''Terminator.''\n\nGary's sound work on ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' led to further innovations, as he and his team set out to create dinosaur sounds by mixing together numerous different animal vocalizations to make the audience feel as though giant bellowing prehistoric beasts surrounded them.
