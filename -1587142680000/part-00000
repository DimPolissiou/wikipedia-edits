The act was introduced in the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of the Parliament, on 19 July 2019 by the [[Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment|Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment]], [[Thawar Chand Gehlot]], in light of the lapse of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2018. The 2019 act and the immediately preceding 2018 bill, were both preceded by a 2016 version,. They were met with protests and criticism by transgender persons, lawyers, and activists in India. The 2016 bill was sent to a Standing Committee which submitted its report in July  2017. Following this, the Lok Sabha tabled and passed a newer version of the bill in December 2018. However, it did not incorporate many of the committee's recommendations. Although members of the Opposition criticised the 2019 act and assured transgender persons of not voting in favour of it, it was passed by the Lok Sabha on 5 August 2019 and by the [[Rajya Sabha]], the upper house of the Parliament, on 26 November 2019. The President assented to it on 5 December 2019, upon which the act was notified in the [[Gazette of India]]. It was brought into effect from 10 January 2020 onwards vide a notification in the Gazette on the same day.\n\nFollowing protests by the [[LGBT|queer community]] against the 2016 and 2018 bills, the 2019 act has done away with few of the severely criticised provisions of the 2018 bill, such as criminalisation of begging and the establishment of a District Screening Committee to process applications for issuance of transgender person certificates. However, it fails to incorporate yet other principles in line with the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] judgment in ''[[National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India]]'' (''NALSA v. UOI'') in 2014, such as the right of transgender persons to self-perceived gender identity without undergoing [[sex reassignment surgery]], and mandatory reservations in jobs and educational institutions. The act has also been criticised for the lesser punishment for crimes against transgender persons compared with punishment for crimes against [[cisgender|cisgender persons]].\n\nIn January 2014, while judicial pronouncement in the ''NALSA'' petition was pending, the ministry had published an Expert Committee Report on issues relating to transgender persons, after consultations with transgender persons. [[Tiruchi Siva]], of the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] party, had introduced the [[Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014|Rights of Transgender Persons Bill]] in 2014, in the Rajya Sabha, which was passed by the house in 2015. The 2014 bill contains provisions progressive to those in the bills introduced in between 2016 and 2019, but has been pending in the Lok Sabha since 2015. Prior to the [[Indian general elections, 2019|2019 general elections]], parties such as the [[Indian National Congress]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] had promised in their respective electoral manifestoes to, respectively, withdraw the 2018 bill \u2014 while introducing a new one consulting members of the queer community \u2014 and pass the 2014 bill.\n\n==History and background==\n[[File:Hijra and companions in Eastern Bengal.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Hijras in eastern Bengal, ''circa'' 1860]]\n{{LGBT rights}}\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court of India delivered its judgment in ''National Legal Services Authority v.

Bill, 2014|The Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014]]\n| summary =\n| keywords =\n| status = In force\n\n}}\n\nThe '''Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019''' is an [[Act (law)|act]] of the [[Parliament of India]] with the objective to provide for protection of rights of [[Transgender|transgender persons]], their welfare, and other related matters. The act was introduced in the [[Lok Sabha]], the lower house of the Parliament, on 19 July 2019 by the [[Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment|Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment]], [[Thawar Chand Gehlot]], in light of the lapse of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2018. The 2019 act and the immediately preceding 2018 bill, were both preceded by a 2016 version,. They were met with protests and criticism by transgender persons, lawyers, and activists in India. The 2016 bill was sent to a Standing Committee which submitted its report in July  2017. Following this, the Lok Sabha tabled and passed a newer version of the bill in December 2018. However, it did not incorporate many of the committee's recommendations. Although members of the Opposition criticised the 2019 act and assured transgender persons of not voting in favour of it, it was passed by the Lok Sabha on 5 August 2019 and by the [[Rajya Sabha]], the upper house of the Parliament, on 26 November 2019. The President assented to it on 5 December 2019, upon which the act was notified in the [[Gazette of India]]. It was brought into effect from 10 January 2020 onwards vide a notification in the Gazette on the same day.\n\nFollowing protests by the [[LGBT|queer community]] against the 2016 and 2018 bills, the 2019 act has done away with few of the severely criticised provisions of the 2018 bill, such as criminalisation of begging and the establishment of a District Screening Committee to process applications for issuance of transgender person certificates. However, it fails to incorporate yet other principles in line with the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] judgment in ''[[National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India]]'' (''NALSA v. UOI'') in 2014, such as the right of transgender persons to self-perceived gender identity without undergoing [[sex reassignment surgery]], and mandatory reservations in jobs and educational institutions. The act has also been criticised for the lesser punishment for crimes against transgender persons compared with punishment for crimes against [[cisgender|cisgender persons]].\n\nIn January 2014, while judicial pronouncement in the ''NALSA'' petition was pending, the ministry had published an Expert Committee Report on issues relating to transgender persons, after consultations with transgender persons. [[Tiruchi Siva]], of the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] party, had introduced the [[Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014|Rights of Transgender Persons Bill]] in 2014, in the Rajya Sabha, which was passed by the house in 2015. The 2014 bill contains provisions progressive to those in the bills introduced in between 2016 and 2019, but has been pending in the Lok Sabha since 2015. Prior to the [[Indian general elections, 2019|2019 general elections]], parties such as the [[Indian National Congress]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] had promised in their respective electoral manifestoes to, respectively, withdraw the 2018 bill \u2014 while introducing a new one consulting members of the queer community \u2014 and pass the 2014 bill.\n\n==History and background==\n[[File:Hijra and companions in Eastern Bengal.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Hijras in eastern Bengal, ''circa'' 1860]]\n{{LGBT rights}}\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court of India delivered its judgment in ''National Legal Services Authority v.

It was co-written by Bowie and [[Brian Eno]], produced by Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]], and recorded in July and August 1977 at [[Hansa Tonstudio|Hansa Studio by the Wall]]. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|12th studio album of the same name]], backed with the song \"[[V-2 Schneider]]\". A product of Bowie's [[Berlin Trilogy|\"Berlin\" period]], the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or United States after its release, but it has since become one of his [[signature song]]s. In January 2016, following Bowie's death, the song reached a new peak of number 12 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} has been cited as Bowie's second-most covered song after \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': pp. 90\u201392</ref>\n\nInspired by the sight of Bowie's producer-engineer Tony Visconti embracing his lover by the [[Berlin Wall]], the song tells the story of two lovers, one from [[East Berlin|East]] and one from [[West Berlin]].

The other parts consist of [[synthesizer]] parts by Eno using an [[Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd|EMS]] [[VCS3]] to produce detuned low-frequency drones, with the beat frequencies from the three [[oscillators]], producing a juddering effect.

It was co-written by Bowie and [[Brian Eno]], produced by Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]], and recorded in July and August 1977 at [[Hansa Tonstudio|Hansa Studio by the Wall]]. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|12th studio album of the same name]], backed with the song \"[[V-2 Schneider]]\". A product of Bowie's [[Berlin Trilogy|\"Berlin\" period]], the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or United States after its release, but it has since become one of his [[signature song]]s. In January 2016, following Bowie's death, the song reached a new peak of number 12 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} has been cited as Bowie's second-most covered song after \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': pp. 90\u201392</ref>\n\nInspired by the sight of Bowie's producer-engineer Tony Visconti embracing his lover by the [[Berlin Wall]], the song tells the story of two lovers, one from [[East Berlin|East]] and one from [[West Berlin]]. Bowie's performance of {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} on [[Berlin Wall#David Bowie, 1987|June 6, 1987]], at the German [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] in [[West Berlin]] has been considered a catalyst to the later [[fall of the Berlin Wall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/david-bowie-death/423483/|work=The Atlantic|last=Ford|first=Matt|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=11 January 2016|title=Remembering David Bowie|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112083919/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/david-bowie-death/423483/|archive-date=12 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/11/10749546/david-bowie-berlin-wall-heroes|work=Vox|last=Fisher|first=Max|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=11 January 2016|title=David Bowie at the Berlin Wall: the incredible story of a concert and its role in history|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113052820/http://www.vox.com/2016/1/11/10749546/david-bowie-berlin-wall-heroes|archive-date=13 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-berlin-wall.com/videos/david-bowie-plays-berlin-711/|publisher=Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=9 November 2014|title=The Berlin Wall \u2013 A multimedia history: David Bowie plays Berlin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114015829/http://www.the-berlin-wall.com/videos/david-bowie-plays-berlin-711/|archive-date=14 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Following his [[Death of David Bowie|death]] in January 2016, the German government thanked Bowie for \"helping to bring down the Wall\", adding \"you are now among Heroes\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/11/germany-to-david-bowie-thank-you-for-helping-to-bring-down-the-berlin-wall/ |title=Germany to David Bowie: Thank You for Helping to Bring Down the Berlin Wall |magazine=Foreign Policy |date=11 January 2016 |accessdate=12 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004130922/http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/11/germany-to-david-bowie-thank-you-for-helping-to-bring-down-the-berlin-wall/ |archive-date=4 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} has received numerous accolades since its release, as seen with its inclusion on lists ranking the \"greatest songs\" compiled by various music publications; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named the song the 46th greatest ever, and ''[[NME]]'' named it the 15th greatest.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/david-bowie-heroes-20110525 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050101013301/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/6596661/500songs|archive-date=1 January 2005|title=The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time \u2013 November 2003|accessdate=26 September 2016 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref name=\"NME500\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nme_500_greatest_songs_2014.htm|accessdate=15 February 2016|work=NME|title=NME The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218133410/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nme_500_greatest_songs_2014.htm|archive-date=18 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Pitchfork Media\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/pitchfork.htm|title=The Pitchfork 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present|accessdate=15 January 2016|publisher=Pitchfork Media|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108135757/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/Pitchfork.htm|archive-date=8 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Bowie scholar David Buckley has written that {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} \"is perhaps pop's definitive statement of the potential triumph of the human spirit over adversity\".<ref>{{cite book|author=David Buckley|title=David Bowie: The Music and The Changes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lboSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT63|year=2015|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-78323-617-6|page=63|access-date=22 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302054741/https://books.google.com/books?id=lboSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT63|archive-date=2 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Title and lyrics==\nThe song title is a reference to the 1975 track \"[[Neu!

The other parts consist of [[synthesizer]] parts by Eno using an [[Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd|EMS]] [[VCS3]] to produce detuned low-frequency drones, with the beat frequencies from the three [[oscillators]], producing a juddering effect. In addition, [[King Crimson]] guitarist [[Robert Fripp]] generated an unusual sustained sound by allowing his guitar to [[Audio feedback|feed back]] and sitting at different positions in the room to alter the [[pitched feedback|pitch of the feedback]].

{"title_page": "Batting order (cricket)", "text_new": "{{About|the term \"batting order\" as used in cricket|usage of the term in baseball|Batting order (baseball)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n\nIn [[cricket]], the '''batting order''' is the sequence in which batters play through their team's [[innings]], there always being two batters taking part at any one time. All eleven players in a team are required to bat if the innings is completed (i.e., if the innings does not close early due to a [[Declaration and forfeiture|declaration]] or other factor).\n\nThe batting order is colloquially subdivided into:{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n* Top order (batters one to three)\n* Middle order (batters four to eight; which can also be divided into:)\n** Upper Middle order (batters four and five)\n** Lower Middle order (batters six and seven)\n* Tail Enders (batters nine to eleven)\n\nThe order in which the eleven players will bat is usually established before the start of a cricket match, but may be altered during play. The decision is based on factors such as each player's specialities; the position each batter is most comfortable with; each player's skills and attributes as a batter; possible combinations with other batters; and the match situation whereby, for example, the team may require a more defensive or attacking player at that point in the innings. Also, a middle order batter in Tests may open for [[One Day International|ODI]]<nowiki/>s and [[Twenty20]] due to their controlled approach to the game.\n\n==Changing the batting order==\nThe [[captain (cricket)|captain]] of the team can change the batting order during the game at his or her discretion.  They can even change the batting line-up from one game to another in a tournament or series. There are no rules about the nature or number of changes made and, if more than one [[innings]] is played, the order used in each need not be the same. It has even been known for a captain to completely reverse his batting order for the second innings after [[following on]]. This has made it possible for a bowler to take a [[Hat-trick (cricket)|hat-trick]] across three consecutive overs of a match, including the same batsman twice.<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/266958.html Cricinfo Ask Steven Column] \u2013 see the last question \u2013 retrieved 16 November 2006.</ref>\n\nThere are various reasons why the captain might make a change from the established order. Usually, however, captains and coaches prefer not to adjust the batting order unless necessary, as for example when [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]] moved [[Imran Tahir]] up the order against India because the South African top 7 batsmen were poor against spin bowlers, a plan which backfired spectacularly.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 3rd Test: India v South Africa at Nagpur, Nov 25\u201327, 2015 {{!}} Cricket Scorecard {{!}} ESPN Cricinfo|url = http://www.espncricinfo.com/india-v-south-africa-2015-16/engine/match/903607.html|website = Cricinfo|accessdate = 27 December 2015}}</ref> In [[South African cricket team in England in 2017#Test series|2017]], [[Faf du Plessis]], who returned to the side as Test Captain after paternity leave, decided to make many changes to the batting lineup before the second test against England after being handed a heavy defeat. Du Plessis replaced JP Duminy at no. 5, and moved Quinton de Kock from 5 to 4 (de Kock already moved from no. 7 to 5 between the 1st and 2nd innings of the first Test), and due to the suspension of Kagiso Rabada due to demerit points, so [[Duanne Olivier]] replaced him, Philander moved up a spot to no. 7, while [[Theunis de Bruyn]] was replaced by [[Chris Morris (cricketer)|Chris Morris]] at no. 8.\n\n===Pinch hitter===\n{{Main|Pinch hitter (cricket)}}\nIf the state of the game requires runs to be scored quickly, a captain will often promote a batter who is known to score quickly up the order. This is usually a lower-order batter, as their wicket is not regarded as being so valuable. A batter who is promoted up the order with the intention of scoring quick runs is called a [[Pinch hitter (cricket)|pinch hitter]] or [[Pinch hitter (cricket)|slogger]]. Some examples of a pinch hitter would be [[David Miller (cricketer)|David Miller]], [[Glenn Maxwell]], [[Shahid Afridi]] & [[Thisara Perera]].{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Nightwatchman===\n{{Main|Nightwatchman (cricket)}}\nWhen a wicket falls near the end of the day, a lower order (less capable) batter might be sent in to bat with the intention that the more capable players will be held in reserve until the next morning. The more capable players are then not exposed to the risk of dismissal while tired or in low-light conditions. The batter who is sent in is known as the nightwatchman. This tactic is also used because players are typically nervous and unsettled at the start of the innings before settling into their rhythm and becoming \"set\". Sending a specialist batter in late in the day means that he or she will have to survive one such period in the afternoon, before doing the same again after the resumption of play the next day, increasing the chance of a dismissal, so a less valuable batter is sent in instead.\n\n=={{anchor|Opening batsmen or openers}}Opening batsmen==\nThe '''opening [[batsmen]]''' or '''openers''' are the batters who bat first in the [[innings]] (no. 1 and 2). This position is important as the openers need to get the innings off to a good start. The early fall of [[wickets]] can have a psychological impact on the rest of the team, affecting their performance with the bat. The opening batters also get the first experience of the [[Cricket pitch|pitch]] and conditions, and must be able to adjust to them quickly.\n\nMost importantly, the opening batters must face a new [[Cricket ball|ball]], which is hard and has a pronounced seam. This makes it more liable to travel fast, bounce high, [[Seam bowling|seam]] around (i.e., bounce unpredictably off the seam) and [[Swing bowling|swing]] (i.e., deviate sideways when travelling through the air). These early conditions favour the bowling team, so the opening batters must have considerable patience, a sound technique and be good defensively. As the ball gets older, its condition starts to favour the batting team. Therefore, the openers will ideally stay at the [[Crease (cricket)|crease]] long enough to protect the batters further down the order.\n\nIn [[first-class cricket]], the rate at which the openers score runs is not as important as \"taking the shine off\" the new ball. This is the process of softening and roughening the [[cricket ball]], whose condition tends to degrade the longer it is in play. By occupying the crease for a long time and taking the shine off the ball, the openers themselves are able to score more freely later on. This also makes batting easier for the rest of the order. Because of the defensive technique required early on, openers are sometimes less fluent stroke-players than the specialist batters who follow.\n\nIn [[limited overs cricket]], the role of opening batter is slightly different. In this type of cricket a high [[run rate]] is a necessity. Also, in the early 1990s, [[fielding restrictions (cricket)|fielding restrictions]] were introduced in the early overs of the game, limiting the fielding side to only two players on the [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]]. To start the innings effectively and take advantage of the fielding restrictions, it became beneficial to have an aggressive batsman opening the innings.\n\nIf an opening batter remains [[not out]] at the end of the team's innings, after all 10 other batters have been dismissed, he or she is said to have [[Carry the bat|carried the bat]].\n\n==Top order==\nThe '''top order''' is defined as the batsmen batting at positions 1, 2, and 3. The batsmen who bat at positions 3, 4 and 5 in the order are sometimes the most technically proficient batsmen with the best stroke play. As they are likely to face an older ball that is easier to score runs against, they must aim to make a large number of runs. They may be exposed to the new ball if an opener loses his wicket early on and so must be equipped to deal with this scenario as well. Top and middle order batsmen must also be adaptable as they may be required to attack, consolidate or defend according to the needs of the team as the match situation develops. The world's most prolific and best recognised batsmen are generally found in the top order.\n\n==Middle order==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nThe '''middle order''' is typically defined as the batsmen batting at positions 4, 5, 6 and 7. It usually consists of versatile batters who must continue to build an innings. The middle order batter is likely to be facing a much older ball bowled by a [[spin bowling|spin bowler]] and defensive technique is necessary to overcome this type of attack, but they are often also fleet-footed players who attack slow bowling by charging down the pitch. The middle order players must also be adept at making runs when playing with the poor quality batters in the lower order. This requires the ability to manipulate the strike so that the tail-enders are shielded from the more potent bowlers. \n\nPlayers who are designated as [[all-rounders]] often bat in the middle order (e.g., [[Garfield Sobers]] usually batted at number 6; by contrast, [[W G Grace|W. G. Grace]] always opened the innings). Wicketkeepers generally bat in the middle order as well, often at number 6 or 7 (e.g. [[Adam Gilchrist]] early in his career). One reason for placing all-rounders and wicket-keepers in the middle-order even though they may be more skilled than those who batted above them was because such players would be tired after bowling or keeping wicket during the preceding innings. Another reason, with the trend of wicketkeepers opening the innings in limited-over cricket, batsmen at positions 6, 7 and 8 tend to be at the crease when the first or second new ball is due, so they can function just like an opener and know how to wear out the new ball, or play aggressively to score quick runs to chase victory or to build the innings quickly towards a declaration. It is also plausible to see substitute wicketkeepers at 5.\n\nIn [[One Day International]] cricket, middle order batters are generally able to change their game depending on the conditions.  If their team loses wickets early, they must be able to play a long careful innings. Conversely, if they are not required to bat until later in the game, they must be able to attempt to score quickly, often attempting to hit many fours or sixes, and if they only have a short period to bat, they are expected to be innovative and able to settle after a short period. In run-chases they are required to be good at calculating and minimising the risks needed to reach the target, by scoring at close to the rate required. If they score more quickly than is required, they run the risk of getting out and exposing the weaker, lower-order batsmen to the pressure situation, but if they score too slowly, then they fall behind schedule and the pressure again increases.\n\n==Lower order or tail==\nThe '''lower order''' is defined as the batsmen batting at positions 8, 9, 10 and 11. It is usually made up of players who have average or poor batting skills, commonly known as '''tailenders''' ('''tail ender''' or '''tail-ender'''). These players are the team's specialist [[Bowler (cricket)|bowler]]s and sometimes the wicketkeeper, or even players on debut if their batting abilities are unproven because bowlers with better batting abilities, aspiring all-rounders or wicketkeepers do have a chance to move up the order over the course of their careers (notably [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]] moved from 8 to 3\u20135, and [[Ashton Agar]] moved from 11 to 7 in first-class cricket). However, some bowlers do establish themselves as competent lower order batters, especially at no. 8 where many bowlers become bowling all-rounders, as in the case of fast bowlers [[Wasim Akram]] and [[Jason Holder]] who, both, have a double Test century each to their names. By the same token, opening batters could move down the order due to poor form, having a top-heavy line-up or being better suited to play against spin bowling (notably [[Moeen Ali]] moving down from an opener to no. 7, or even 8, since 2015 Ashes series, but has since also played at 3 in 2018). Therefore, the start of the lower order may vary in position depending on the balance of the side in terms of overall batting capability. Also, given that batters in ODIs and Twenty20 need to score quickly and aggressively, an opener in limited-over forms of the game may bat down the order in tests.\n\nIt is likely that these batters will be dismissed for low scores. However, as expectations of these players are low when they are batting, they often play aggressive, carefree shots in the hope of scoring as many runs as possible. On occasion, the scores posted by the lower order have made a difference to the outcome of a match. If a significant contribution has come from the tail-enders, it is often said that \"the tail wagged\".\n\nOn occasions in which the batting team is a long way behind its opponents, the lower-order batters may attempt to salvage a draw by playing defensively until the end of the match. An example of this would be the first test in the [[2009 Ashes series#First Test|2009 Ashes series]], in which England bowlers [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] and [[Monty Panesar]] were able to remain at the crease for 11.3 overs, denying Australia the chance to win the match.\n\nThe last batter in the order (at position 11) is sometimes referred to as ''Last Man Jack'', a term that has passed into everyday parlance. This is because if the batting order were arranged as a pack of [[playing cards|cards]] numbers 9 and 10 would be followed by [[Jack (playing card)|Jack]]. Those batters who bat at positions 7, 8, and 9 are also known as middle\u2013lower order batters.\n\n==Highest Test match scores for each batting position==\n===Men===\n# Sir [[Len Hutton]] (ENG): 364 vs. Australia at The Oval, 1938\n# [[Matthew Hayden]] (AUS): 380 vs. Zimbabwe at Perth, 2003\u201304\n# [[Brian Lara]] (WI): 400* vs. England at St. John's, 2003\u201304\n# [[Mahela Jayawardene]] (SL): 374 vs. South Africa at Colombo, 2006\u201307\n# [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] (AUS): 329* vs. India at Sydney, 2012\n# [[Ben Stokes]] (ENG): 258 vs. South Africa at Newlands, 2016\n# Sir [[Donald Bradman]] (AUS): 270 vs. England at Melbourne, 1936\u201337 (Note: Bradman usually batted much higher in the batting order, but he reversed his team's batting order to protect the top order from an unpredictable pitch, resulting in him batting at number 7)\n# [[Wasim Akram]] (PAK): 257* vs. Zimbabwe at Sheikhupura, 1996\u201397\n# [[Ian Smith (New Zealand cricketer)|Ian Smith]] (NZ): 173 vs. India at Auckland, 1989\u201390\n# [[Walter Read]] (ENG): 117 vs. Australia at The Oval, 1884 (Note: Read normally batted in the middle order, between number 4 and 6)\n# [[Ashton Agar]] (AUS): 98 vs. England at Trent Bridge, 2013 (Note: This was Agar's debut Test match)\nSource:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/282860.html|title=Records - Test matches - Batting records - Most runs in an innings (by batting position) - ESPNcricinfo|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Women===\n# [[Kiran Baluch]] (PAK): 242 vs. [[West Indies women's cricket team]] at [[National Stadium, Karachi|Karachi]], 2004\n# [[Thirush Kamini]] (IND): 192 vs. [[South Africa women's national cricket team]] at [[Srikantadatta Narasimha Raja Wadeyar Ground|Mysore]], 2014\n# [[Karen Rolton]] (AUS): 209[[Not out|*]] vs. [[England women's cricket team|England]] at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]], 2001\n# [[Mithali Raj]] (IND): 214 vs. England at [[County Ground, Taunton|Taunton]], 2002\n# [[Emily Drumm]] (NZ): 161[[Not out|*]] vs. [[Australia women's national cricket team|Australia]] at [[Hagley Oval|Christchurch]], 1995\n# [[Yvonne van Mentz]] (RSA): 105[[Not out|*]] vs. England at [[Newlands Cricket Ground|Newlands]], 1961\n# [[Kathryn Leng]] (ENG): 144 vs. Australia at [[North Marine Road Ground, Scarborough|Scarborough]], 1996\n# [[Chamani Seneviratne]] (SL): 105[[Not out|*]] vs. Australia at [[Havelock Park]], 1998\n# [[Debbie Wilson (cricketer)|Debbie Wilson]] (AUS): 92[[Not out|*]] vs. [[New Zealand women's national cricket team|New Zealand]], at [[Cornwall Park, Auckland]], 1990\n# [[Shelley Nitschke]] (AUS): 81[[Not out|*]] vs. England, at [[County Cricket Ground, Hove|Hove]], 2005\n# [[Clea Smith]] (AUS): 42 vs. England, at Hove, 2005\n\nSource:<ref name=\"ESPNcricinfo -  Records - Women's Test matches - Batting records - Most runs in an innings (by batting position)\">{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/284240.html|title=Records - Women's Test matches - Batting records - Most runs in an innings (by batting position)|publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|accessdate=16 January 2018}}</ref><br/>\nNitschke's score of 81 and Smith's 42 in the [[Australian women's cricket team in England in 2005|2005]] [[Women's Ashes]] in a [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 139 is the highest last wicket partnership in women's test cricket.<ref name=\"The Guardian - 12 January 2018 - The Joy of Six: 10th-wicket partnerships in Test cricket\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jan/12/the-joy-of-six-10th-wicket-partnerships-in-test-cricket|title=The Joy of Six: 10th-wicket partnerships in Test cricket|last=Miller|first=Nick|date=12 January 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Batting order (baseball)]]\n{{Portal|Cricket}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cricket positions}}\n\n[[Category:Batting (cricket)]]\n[[Category:Cricket captaincy and tactics]]\n[[Category:Cricket terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the term \"batting order\" as used in cricket|usage of the term in baseball|Batting order (baseball)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n\nIn [[cricket]], the '''batting order''' is the sequence in which batters play through their team's [[innings]], there always being two batters taking part at any one time. All eleven players in a team are required to bat if the innings is completed (i.e., if the innings does not close early due to a [[Declaration and forfeiture|declaration]] or other factor).\n\nThe batting order is colloquially subdivided into:{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n* Top order (batters one to three)\n* Middle order (batters four to eight; which can also be divided into:)\n** Upper Middle order (batters four and five)\n** Lower Middle order (batters six and seven)\n* Tail Enders (batters nine to eleven)\n\nThe order in which the eleven players will bat is usually established before the start of a cricket match, but may be altered during play. The decision is based on factors such as each player's specialities; the position each batter is most comfortable with; each player's skills and attributes as a batter; possible combinations with other batters; and the match situation whereby, for example, the team may require a more defensive or attacking player at that point in the innings. Also, a middle order batter in Tests may open for [[One Day International|ODI]]<nowiki/>s and [[Twenty20]] due to their controlled approach to the game.\n\n==Changing the batting order==\nThe [[captain (cricket)|captain]] of the team can change the batting order during the game at his or her discretion.  They can even change the batting line-up from one game to another in a tournament or series. There are no rules about the nature or number of changes made and, if more than one [[innings]] is played, the order used in each need not be the same. It has even been known for a captain to completely reverse his batting order for the second innings after [[following on]]. This has made it possible for a bowler to take a [[hat-trick#Cricket|hat-trick]] across three consecutive overs of a match, including the same batsman twice.<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/266958.html Cricinfo Ask Steven Column] \u2013 see the last question \u2013 retrieved 16 November 2006.</ref>\n\nThere are various reasons why the captain might make a change from the established order.

The Resolution gives for the first time, a special recognition to all humanitarian and United Nations and associated personnel who have worked in the promotion of the humanitarian cause and those who have lost their lives in the cause of duty and urges all Member States, entities of the United Nations within existing resources, as well as the other [[International organization|International Organizations]] and [[Non-governmental organization|Non-Governmental Organizations]] to observe it annually in an appropriate way. As a background to this landmark resolution, the family of S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello resolved to work towards having 19 August recognized as a befitting tribute to all humanitarian personnel. Early April 2008 the Board of the S\u00e9rgio Vieira de Mello Foundation prepared a draft Resolution to be sponsored and adopted by the General Assembly designating 19 August as World Humanitarian Day. France, Switzerland, Japan and Brazil, contacted with the draft Resolution, agreed to co-sponsor it.\n\nSergio Vieira de Mello founded two Human Rights Agencies: the United Nations Housing Rights Programme and United Nations Human Rights Educational Project (UNHREP).

The city was first referenced as early as 7 BC by Greek geographer and philosopher [[Strabo]] in Book XII of his ''[[Geographica]]'' (which detailed settlements in the Anatolia region), alongside the port town of [[Antiphellus]]; which served as the settlement's main trade front.\n\nIts exact location, particularly in regard to Antiphellus, was misinterpreted for many years. Strabo incorrectly designates both settlements as inland towns, closer to each other than is actually evident today. Additionally, upon its rediscovery in 1840 by [[Sir Charles Fellows]], the settlement was located near the village of '''Saaret''', west-northwest of Antiphellus. Verifying research into its location in ancient text proved difficult for Fellows, with illegible Greek [[inscriptions]] providing the sole written source at the site. However, [[Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt]] details in his 1847 work ''Travels in Lycia'' that validation is provided in the words of [[Pliny the Elder]], who places Phellus north of '''Habessus''' (Antiphellus' pre-[[Hellenization|Hellenic]] name).\n\n==Expeditions==\n\n===Fellows Expedition===\n[[Sir Charles Fellows]] participated in two largely successful expeditions to Lycia, in 1838 and 1840 respectively.<ref name=\"spratt13\">Spratt (1847), p. 13</ref> During which, he discovered large settlements such as [[Xanthos]], [[Tlos]], [[Pinara]] and [[Cadyanda]] in order to map their locations and bring back artifacts for public display in the [[United Kingdom]] (specifically [[The British Museum]]).<ref name=\"spratt13\"/><ref>Auerbach, Hoffenberg (2013), p. 185</ref> In the process, he also came to discover six other, smaller locations, one of which being the site of what is now known as Phellus.<ref name=\"spratt13\"/> Fellows had named all six settlements himself, without regard to thorough classical research; which inevitably altered the original names given at the time of occupation. For instance, Fellows' 'Gagae' was actually [[Corydala]], and Phellus is initially referenced as '[[Pyrrha]]' by the [[Roman Empire]] (in honour of the [[Greek myth]] that was detailed in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'')<ref>Ovid (1997), p. 118</ref>  according to the works of [[Pliny the Elder]].<ref name=Spratt14>Spratt (1847), p. 14</ref><ref name=\"pliny\">Pliny the Elder (1848), p. 93</ref>\n\n===Spratt Expedition===\nIn 1841 the crew of [[HMS Meteor (1823)|HMS ''Beacon'']], headed by [[shipmaster]] Richard Hoskyn, located and traveled to several Lycian archaeological sites under the request of [[Thomas Graves (1802\u20131856)|Thomas Graves]].<ref name=\"spratt13\"/> Many of the  settlements in question had already been discovered by Charles Fellows in the previous year, including the valley of Xanthos, despite the crew being unaware of this fact at the time.<ref name=\"spratt13\"/> The expedition was short in duration, and only accomplished basic surveillance of archaeological sites for the most part.<ref name=Spratt14/> However, the group had initiated the restoration of [[Lydia|Cybriatic]] settlements, including that of [[Balbura (Lycia)|Balbura]], [[Podalia]], Massicytus and [[Oenoanda]], all of which had been discovered and named by the expedition after journeying into the mainland of the [[Antalya Province]] (although [[Araxa]] is the more consensually approved name for Massicytus).<ref name=Spratt14/><ref>Spratt (1847), p. 267</ref> Hoskyn's findings and experiences were later documented in the journal for the ''[[Royal Geographical Society]]'' in 1843.<ref name=Spratt14/>\n\nAn expedition to the Lycian region under the guidance of [[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt]] was to follow.

The city was first referenced as early as 7 BC by Greek geographer and philosopher [[Strabo]] in Book XII of his ''[[Geographica]]'' (which detailed settlements in the Anatolia region), alongside the port town of [[Antiphellus]]; which served as the settlement's main trade front.\n\nIts exact location, particularly in regard to Antiphellus, was misinterpreted for many years. Strabo incorrectly designates both settlements as inland towns, closer to each other than is actually evident today. Additionally, upon its rediscovery in 1840 by [[Sir Charles Fellows]], the settlement was located near the village of '''Saaret''', west-northwest of Antiphellus. Verifying research into its location in ancient text proved difficult for Fellows, with illegible Greek [[inscriptions]] providing the sole written source at the site. However, [[Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt]] details in his 1847 work ''Travels in Lycia'' that validation is provided in the words of [[Pliny the Elder]], who places Phellus north of '''Habessus''' (Antiphellus' pre-[[Hellenization|Hellenic]] name).\n\n==Expeditions==\n\n===Fellows Expedition===\n[[Sir Charles Fellows]] participated in two largely successful expeditions to Lycia, in 1838 and 1840 respectively.<ref name=\"spratt13\">Spratt (1847), p. 13</ref> During which, he discovered large settlements such as [[Xanthos]], [[Tlos]], [[Pinara]] and [[Cadyanda]] in order to map their locations and bring back artifacts for public display in the [[United Kingdom]] (specifically [[The British Museum]]).<ref name=\"spratt13\"/><ref>Auerbach, Hoffenberg (2013), p. 185</ref> In the process, he also came to discover six other, smaller locations, one of which being the site of what is now known as Phellus.<ref name=\"spratt13\"/> Fellows had named all six settlements himself, without regard to thorough classical research; which inevitably altered the original names given at the time of occupation. For instance, Fellows' 'Gagae' was actually [[Corydala]], and Phellus is initially referenced as '[[Pyrrha]]' by the [[Roman Empire]] (in honour of the [[Greek myth]] that was detailed in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'')<ref>Ovid (1997), p. 118</ref>  according to the works of [[Pliny the Elder]].<ref name=Spratt14>Spratt (1847), p. 14</ref><ref name=\"pliny\">Pliny the Elder (1848), p. 93</ref>\n\n===Spratt Expedition===\nIn 1841 the crew of [[HMS Meteor (1823)|HMS ''Beacon'']], headed by [[shipmaster]] Richard Hoskyn, located and traveled to several Lycian archaeological sites under the request of [[Thomas Graves (1802\u20131856)|Thomas Graves]].<ref name=\"spratt13\"/> Many of the  settlements in question had already been discovered by Charles Fellows in the previous year, including the valley of Xanthos, despite the crew being unaware of this fact at the time.<ref name=\"spratt13\"/> The expedition was short in duration, and only accomplished basic surveillance of archaeological sites for the most part.<ref name=Spratt14/> However, the group had initiated the restoration of [[Lydia|Cybriatic]] settlements, including that of [[Balbura (Lycia)|Balbura]], [[Podalia]], Massicytus and [[Oenoanda]], all of which had been discovered and named by the expedition after journeying into the mainland of the [[Antalya Province]] (although [[Araxa]] is the more consensually approved name for Massicytus).<ref name=Spratt14/><ref>Spratt (1847), p. 267</ref> Hoskyn's findings and experiences were later documented in the journal for the ''[[Royal Geographical Society]]'' in 1843.<ref name=Spratt14/>\n\nAn expedition to the Lycian region under the guidance of [[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice-Admiral]] [[Thomas Abel Brimage Spratt]] was to follow.
