Some have been converted to Class&nbsp;320 and are operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]].\n\n==Description==\nThree sub-classes were built. The first two were built for the [[Network SouthEast]] sector for operation on services from [[Liverpool Street railway station|London Liverpool Street]] and [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], while the third was built for [[Regional Railways]] for use on [[West Yorkshire Metro|West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] services from [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]]. As part of the [[privatisation of British Rail]], ownership of the class passed from [[British Rail]]  to the [[Eversholt Rail Group]] in April 1994.<ref>[https://www.eversholtrail.co.uk/fleet-portfolio Class 321] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002065624/https://www.eversholtrail.co.uk/fleet-portfolio |date=2 October 2015 }} Eversholt Rail</ref>\n\nEach unit consisted of four carriages: two outer driving trailers, one of which contained first class seating; an intermediate motor coach with standard class seating only, roof mounted [[Brecknell Willis high speed pantograph]] and four [[Brush Traction]] TM2141C traction motors (two per bogie); and an intermediate trailer with standard class seating. All have a maximum speed of {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThey have been modified by the different rail companies which use them. The modifications include new seats, paintwork, lighting and [[passenger information systems]]. \n\n===Class 321/3===\nIn September 1987,  Network SouthEast ordered 46 321/3s for use on services from [[Liverpool Street station|London Liverpool Street]] to [[Cambridge railway station|Cambridge]] and [[Southend Victoria railway station|Southend Victoria]]. The first was unveiled on 15 September 1988.<ref>\"321 rolled-out\" ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' issue 1051 November 1988 page 687</ref> A further 20 were ordered later.<ref name=therailwaycentre/><ref name=TRUK154>\"The Class 321 EMUs\" ''[[Today's Railways UK]]'' issue 154 October 2014 pages 50-57</ref> Units were numbered 321301-366.\n\nThese units replaced slam-door [[British Rail Class 305|Class 305]], [[British Rail Class 307|Class 307]], [[British Rail Class 308|Class 308]] and [[British Rail Class 309|Class 309]] units on trains to [[Clacton railway station|Clacton]] and [[Southend Victoria railway station|Southend-on-Sea]], and worked services on the newly electrified routes to [[Ipswich railway station|Ipswich]] and [[Harwich Town railway station|Harwich]]. They also displaced many [[British Rail Class 312|Class 312]] slam-door units, which moved over to the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway]]. Some of the Class 309s were retained until 1994, and 24 of the newer Class 312 units were retained long-term to work services to [[Walton-on-the-Naze railway station|Walton-on-the-Naze]] and peak services to Clacton, Ipswich and [[Witham railway station|Witham]]. Units carried Network SouthEast livery from new.\n\nIn March 2008, 321361 was named ''Phoenix'' at [[Ilford EMU Depot|Ilford depot]] after it was rebuilt at the disused [[Colchester Carriage Servicing Depot|Colchester shed]] to repair damage caused by an arson attack at Southend Victoria on 10 July 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therailwaycentre.com/News%20April%202008/290408-NEEA.html|title=321361 becomes Ilford's 'Phoenix'|work=TheRailwayCentre.Com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505135254/http://www.therailwaycentre.com/News%20April%202008/290408-NEEA.html|archivedate=5 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe first of 30 321/3s to be refurbished at [[Doncaster Works]], as part of the Renatus project \u2013 which modernised the stock with features such as new air conditioning and heating, seating and Wi-Fi \u2013 was completed in December 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eversholtrail.co.uk/news/transformation-of-the-east-anglia-train-fleet-is-underway|title= Transformation of the East Anglia train fleet is underway|date=January 2017|publisher=Eversholt Rail Group}}</ref><ref>\"321 goes for Renatus\" ''Today's Railways UK'' issue 155 October 2015 page 67</ref><ref>\"Refurbished 321 Renatus Launched\" ''[[Modern Railways]]'' issue 821 February 2017 page 10</ref>\n\n===Class 321/4===\n[[File:321401 - Rugby (8959162488).jpg|thumb|right|321401 in [[Network SouthEast]] livery at [[Rugby railway station|Rugby]]]]\nIn October 1988 a second batch of 30 was ordered. It was intended that 25 be used on [[Great Eastern Main Line]] services and five on [[West Coast Main Line]] services, but in the event all were delivered to [[Bletchley TMD]] for use on the latter. A further 18 followed.<ref name=TRUK154/> Units were numbered 321401\u2013321448. The first was delivered in July 1989.<ref>\"Northampton line Class 321 handed over at BREL, York\" ''Rail'' issue 100 page 17</ref>\n\nThese were built for outer-suburban services on the [[West Coast Main Line]], from [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] to [[Northampton railway station|Northampton]], [[Rugby railway station|Rugby]] and [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]]. They displaced the then-recently cascaded [[British Rail Class 317|Class 317s]] dating from 1981 which had themselves only just been introduced to the route to replace [[British Rail Class 310|Class 310 units]].<ref name=TRUK154/>\n\nEleven 321/4s were transferred for Great Eastern Main Line services. Following this their First Class area was reduced in size to standardise with the 321/3 units in useon that route. This involved removal of the centre partition and double doors and re-upholstering the First Class style 2+2 seats (which were retained at that time) in the de-classified area into the same fabric as the Standard Class seats. Later the First Class 2+2 seats in this de-classified area were replaced with the standard style 2+3 seating. These 11 units were also fitted with a facility to lock out the power door operation within the unit (a basic kind of Selective Operation) to permit operation of 12-car trains on the Braintree and Southminster branch lines, where some platforms were only long enough for 8-car trains.\n\nThe 11 Great Eastern sets passed to [[First Great Eastern]] in January 1997, passing with the franchise to [[National Express East Anglia]] in April 2004 and [[Abellio Greater Anglia]] in February 2012. The 37 West Coast sets passed to [[Silverlink]] in January 1997, passing with the franchise to [[London Midland]] in November 2007. In 2006 unit 321423 was loaned to [[Northern Rail]] while the 321/9s were being overhauled.\n\nFollowing the delivery of the [[British Rail Class 350|Class 350/2]] fleet, 13 Class 321/4s (401\u2013410, 418\u2013420) were transferred from London Midland to [[First Capital Connect]] and overhauled by [[Wabtec Corporation|Wabtec's]] [[Doncaster Works]].<ref>\"FCC receives its first Class 321\" ''Today's Railways UK'' issue 89 May 2009 page 65</ref><ref>\"FCC signs lease for extra Class 321s and 313s\" ''Today's Railways UK'' issue 101 May 2010 page 65</ref> These passed with the franchise to [[Thameslink and Great Northern|Great Northern]] in September 2014. London Midland also released 17 (421\u2013437) for transfer to National Express East Anglia. The remaining seven (411\u2013417) passed to [[Abellio ScotRail]] in 2015, after being converted to three-car [[British Rail Class 320|Class 320/4]] at Doncaster Works.<ref name=\"auto\">\"ScotRail to receive LM Class 321/4s\" ''Rail'' issue 766 21 January 2015 page 27</ref>\n\nIn 2017 ten units (402, 405\u2013410, 418\u2013420) were transferred from Great Northern to Abellio Greater Anglia.<ref name=MR817>\"More EMUs for Anglia\" ''Modern Railways'' issue 817 October 2016 page 12</ref> As at May 2018 the remaining three (401, 403, 404) are to be converted by Wabtec at [[Kilmarnock]] to Class 320/4 for use with Abellio ScotRail.

These units have a similar formation to the earlier units except that there is no first class seating. They were ordered by [[Regional Railways]] for use on [[West Yorkshire Metro|West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] services on the newly electrified [[Wakefield line|Doncaster to Leeds]] route, entering service in 1993. From 1995 they also worked on [[Wharfedale line]] services from Leeds to [[Ilkley railway station|Ilkley]].<ref>\"Ilkley working for Class 321\" ''Rail'' issue 264 25 October 1995 page 26</ref> In March 1997 they passed with the Regional Railways North East franchise to Northern Spirit, which became [[Arriva Trains Northern]] in April 2001. In June 1998 they were loaned to [[Great North Eastern Railway|GNER]] to operate Leeds to [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]] services while its [[InterCity 225]] fleet was grounded with mechanical issues.<ref>\"GNER drafts in foreign EMUs to covers for 225s\" ''Rail'' issue 334 1 July 1998 page 9</ref> All three passed with the franchise to [[Northern Rail]] in December 2004.\n\nThe Class 321/9 units were refurbished at [[Andrew Barclay Sons & Co.|Hunslet-Barclay]], [[Kilmarnock]] from late 2006 to early 2007.<ref name=\"Railway Herald\">{{cite news | url =http://www.railwayherald.co.uk/magazine/pdf/RHUK/Issue60HIGH.pdf| title = News Desk| magazine = Railway Herald | page = 6,7 | issue = 60 | date = 3 November 2006 | accessdate = 16 July 2011}}</ref> The refurbishment included a new livery, refurbished interiors and reliability improvements, similar to the [[British Rail Class 322|Class 322]] EMUs, which were also refurbished at Kilmarnock.<ref name=\"Railway Herald \"/>\n\nThe units transferred to [[Arriva Rail North]] in April 2016, and then [[Northern Trains]] on 1 March 2020. With the Class 331s now in service, 2 of the Class 321/9s transferred to Greater Anglia, as an interim measure until their Class 720 fleet is in service, however neither unit has operated a service as of 20 April 2020.\n\n==Current operations==\n===Greater Anglia===\n[[First Great Eastern]] inherited all 66 Class 321/3s and 11 Class 321/4s. The [[East Anglia franchise]] was subsequently taken over by [[National Express East Anglia]], initially branded 'one', and then subsequently by [[Abellio Greater Anglia|Greater Anglia]]. A further 16 were added, upon release from [[London Midland]]. In 2016, 10 of the sets formerly operated by [[Thameslink and Great Northern|Great Northern]] also transferred to Greater Anglia.\n\nThese trains are primarily used for [[Liverpool Street railway station|London Liverpool Street]] to {{stnlnk|Braintree|England}}, {{stnlnk|Southend Victoria}}, {{stnlnk|Southminster}}, {{stnlnk|Ipswich}} (extending to {{stnlnk|Norwich}} during peak time), {{stnlnk|Walton-on-the-Naze}}, {{stnlnk|Clacton-on-Sea}} and [[Colchester Town railway station|Colchester Town]] but can be seen running on any electrified route if other trains fail. These operate as 4, 8 or 12 carriage sets.\n\nThey have also received 2 Class 321/9s from Northern until the [[British Rail Class 720|Class 720s]] enter service, however neither have entered service as of April 2020.\n\n=== Northern Trains ===\n[[Northern Trains]] inherited three Class 321/9 units from the previous operator, [[Arriva Rail North|Northern]]. These units operate on the [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]] to [[Doncaster railway station|Doncaster]] [[Wakefield line]] service and occasionally on the [[Wharfedale line|Wharfedale]] and [[Airedale line|Airedale]] lines alongside [[British Rail Class 322|Class 322]], [[British Rail Class 333|Class 333s]] and [[British Rail Class 331|Class 331s]]. All passed on to [[Northern Rail]] in 2004 and were refurbished in 2006/07. With the Class 331s having replaced them on Northern Trains duties, 2 of the class 321/9s moved to [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Greater Anglia]] in March 2020, however, as of April 2020, 321903 remains with Northern Trains.\n\n==Former operations==\n===Silverlink / London Midland===\n[[File:321425 A A Watford Junction.JPG|thumb|left|[[Silverlink]] liveried 321425 at {{stnlnk|Watford Junction}}]]\n[[File:321411 Watford Junction E.JPG|thumb|right|[[London Midland]] 321411 at [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]]]]\n[[Silverlink]] inherited 37 of the 48 Class 321/4 units. In September 2003, Silverlink's class 321 units were temporarily withdrawn following the discovery of loose bolts on brake discs in some units.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/entire-fleet-of-commuter-trains-withdrawn-579574.html|last=Elston|first=Laura|title=Entire fleet of commuter trains withdrawn|work=[[The Independent]]|date=11 September 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2004, London Euston to Birmingham local services were divided into two separate services: Silverlink retained London to Northampton services, while fellow [[National Express]] subsidiary [[Central Trains]] taking over all local services between Northampton and Birmingham. Initially, Central Trains hired Class 321 units from Silverlink to work their new services, but the arrival of [[British Rail Class 350|Class 350/1s]] meant that very few Class 321 units were then required.\n\nTo accommodate this sub-lease, three Class 321/3 units were transferred from [[National Express East Anglia]] to Silverlink. These were not permitted north of [[Rugby railway station|Rugby]] due to lack of the National Radio Network system (Eastern Region units only had the Cab Secure Radio System used for Driver Only Operated Passenger services) and therefore could not be used on Central Trains services (although they occasionally appeared on services to Rugby at weekends due to the line being closed between Rugby and Birmingham New Street). This ceased in late 2005 with the introduction of Class 350 trains on the Birmingham to [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool]] route. One of these sub-leased units was involved in a low-speed derailment at Watford Yard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/raib-reports/derailment-at-watford-junction-yard|title=Rail Accident Investigation Branch report, Derailment at Watford Junction yard|work=UK Government|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2007, Central Trains began using Class 321 units on some morning services from Birmingham New Street to [[Walsall railway station|Walsall]].\n\nIn November 2007, [[London Midland]] took over operation of the Class 321 fleet previously used by Silverlink and Central Trains.

Some have been converted to Class&nbsp;320 and are operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]].\n\n==Description==\nThree sub-classes were built. The first two were built for the [[Network SouthEast]] sector for operation on services from [[Liverpool Street railway station|London Liverpool Street]] and [[Euston railway station|London Euston]], while the third was built for [[Regional Railways]] for use on [[West Yorkshire Metro|West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] services from [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]]. As part of the [[privatisation of British Rail]], ownership of the class passed from [[British Rail]]  to the [[Eversholt Rail Group]] in April 1994.<ref>[https://www.eversholtrail.co.uk/fleet-portfolio Class 321] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002065624/https://www.eversholtrail.co.uk/fleet-portfolio |date=2 October 2015 }} Eversholt Rail</ref>\n\nEach unit consisted of four carriages: two outer driving trailers, one of which contained first class seating; an intermediate motor coach with standard class seating only, roof mounted [[Brecknell Willis high speed pantograph]] and four [[Brush Traction]] TM2141C traction motors (two per bogie); and an intermediate trailer with standard class seating. All have a maximum speed of {{convert|100|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThey have been modified by the different rail companies which use them. The modifications include new seats, paintwork, lighting and [[passenger information systems]]. \n\n===Class 321/3===\nIn September 1987,  Network SouthEast ordered 46 321/3s for use on services from [[Liverpool Street station|London Liverpool Street]] to [[Cambridge railway station|Cambridge]] and [[Southend Victoria railway station|Southend Victoria]]. The first was unveiled on 15 September 1988.<ref>\"321 rolled-out\" ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' issue 1051 November 1988 page 687</ref> A further 20 were ordered later.<ref name=therailwaycentre/><ref name=TRUK154>\"The Class 321 EMUs\" ''[[Today's Railways UK]]'' issue 154 October 2014 pages 50-57</ref> Units were numbered 321301-366.\n\nThese units replaced slam-door [[British Rail Class 305|Class 305]], [[British Rail Class 307|Class 307]], [[British Rail Class 308|Class 308]] and [[British Rail Class 309|Class 309]] units on trains to [[Clacton railway station|Clacton]] and [[Southend Victoria railway station|Southend-on-Sea]], and worked services on the newly electrified routes to [[Ipswich railway station|Ipswich]] and [[Harwich Town railway station|Harwich]]. They also displaced many [[British Rail Class 312|Class 312]] slam-door units, which moved over to the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway]]. Some of the Class 309s were retained until 1994, and 24 of the newer Class 312 units were retained long-term to work services to [[Walton-on-the-Naze railway station|Walton-on-the-Naze]] and peak services to Clacton, Ipswich and [[Witham railway station|Witham]]. Units carried Network SouthEast livery from new.\n\nIn March 2008, 321361 was named ''Phoenix'' at [[Ilford EMU Depot|Ilford depot]] after it was rebuilt at the disused [[Colchester Carriage Servicing Depot|Colchester shed]] to repair damage caused by an arson attack at Southend Victoria on 10 July 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therailwaycentre.com/News%20April%202008/290408-NEEA.html|title=321361 becomes Ilford's 'Phoenix'|work=TheRailwayCentre.Com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505135254/http://www.therailwaycentre.com/News%20April%202008/290408-NEEA.html|archivedate=5 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe first of 30 321/3s to be refurbished at [[Doncaster Works]], as part of the Renatus project \u2013 which modernised the stock with features such as new air conditioning and heating, seating and Wi-Fi \u2013 was completed in December 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eversholtrail.co.uk/news/transformation-of-the-east-anglia-train-fleet-is-underway|title= Transformation of the East Anglia train fleet is underway|date=January 2017|publisher=Eversholt Rail Group}}</ref><ref>\"321 goes for Renatus\" ''Today's Railways UK'' issue 155 October 2015 page 67</ref><ref>\"Refurbished 321 Renatus Launched\" ''[[Modern Railways]]'' issue 821 February 2017 page 10</ref>\n\n===Class 321/4===\n[[File:321401 - Rugby (8959162488).jpg|thumb|right|321401 in [[Network SouthEast]] livery at [[Rugby railway station|Rugby]]]]\nIn October 1988 a second batch of 30 was ordered. It was intended that 25 be used on [[Great Eastern Main Line]] services and five on [[West Coast Main Line]] services, but in the event all were delivered to [[Bletchley TMD]] for use on the latter. A further 18 followed.<ref name=TRUK154/> Units were numbered 321401\u2013321448. The first was delivered in July 1989.<ref>\"Northampton line Class 321 handed over at BREL, York\" ''Rail'' issue 100 page 17</ref>\n\nThese were built for outer-suburban services on the [[West Coast Main Line]], from [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] to [[Northampton railway station|Northampton]], [[Rugby railway station|Rugby]] and [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]]. They displaced the then-recently cascaded [[British Rail Class 317|Class 317s]] dating from 1981 which had themselves only just been introduced to the route to replace [[British Rail Class 310|Class 310 units]].<ref name=TRUK154/>\n\nEleven 321/4s were transferred for Great Eastern Main Line services. Following this their First Class area was reduced in size to standardise with the 321/3 units in useon that route. This involved removal of the centre partition and double doors and re-upholstering the First Class style 2+2 seats (which were retained at that time) in the de-classified area into the same fabric as the Standard Class seats. Later the First Class 2+2 seats in this de-classified area were replaced with the standard style 2+3 seating. These 11 units were also fitted with a facility to lock out the power door operation within the unit (a basic kind of Selective Operation) to permit operation of 12-car trains on the Braintree and Southminster branch lines, where some platforms were only long enough for 8-car trains.\n\nThe 11 Great Eastern sets passed to [[First Great Eastern]] in January 1997, passing with the franchise to [[National Express East Anglia]] in April 2004 and [[Abellio Greater Anglia]] in February 2012. The 37 West Coast sets passed to [[Silverlink]] in January 1997, passing with the franchise to [[London Midland]] in November 2007. In 2006 unit 321423 was loaned to [[Northern Rail]] while the 321/9s were being overhauled.\n\nFollowing the delivery of the [[British Rail Class 350|Class 350/2]] fleet, 13 Class 321/4s (401\u2013410, 418\u2013420) were transferred from London Midland to [[First Capital Connect]] and overhauled by [[Wabtec Corporation|Wabtec's]] [[Doncaster Works]].<ref>\"FCC receives its first Class 321\" ''Today's Railways UK'' issue 89 May 2009 page 65</ref><ref>\"FCC signs lease for extra Class 321s and 313s\" ''Today's Railways UK'' issue 101 May 2010 page 65</ref> These passed with the franchise to [[Thameslink and Great Northern|Great Northern]] in September 2014. London Midland also released 17 (421\u2013437) for transfer to National Express East Anglia. The remaining seven (411\u2013417) passed to [[Abellio ScotRail]] in 2015, after being converted to three-car [[British Rail Class 320|Class 320/4]] at Doncaster Works.<ref name=\"auto\">\"ScotRail to receive LM Class 321/4s\" ''Rail'' issue 766 21 January 2015 page 27</ref>\n\nIn 2017 ten units (402, 405\u2013410, 418\u2013420) were transferred from Great Northern to Abellio Greater Anglia.<ref name=MR817>\"More EMUs for Anglia\" ''Modern Railways'' issue 817 October 2016 page 12</ref> As at May 2018 the remaining three (401, 403, 404) are to be converted by Wabtec at [[Kilmarnock]] to Class 320/4 for use with Abellio ScotRail.

These units have a similar formation to the earlier units except that there is no first class seating. They were ordered by [[Regional Railways]] for use on [[West Yorkshire Metro|West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] services on the newly electrified [[Wakefield line|Doncaster to Leeds]] route, entering service in 1993. From 1995 they also worked on [[Wharfedale line]] services from Leeds to [[Ilkley railway station|Ilkley]].<ref>\"Ilkley working for Class 321\" ''Rail'' issue 264 25 October 1995 page 26</ref> In March 1997 they passed with the Regional Railways North East franchise to Northern Spirit, which became [[Arriva Trains Northern]] in April 2001. In June 1998 they were loaned to [[Great North Eastern Railway|GNER]] to operate Leeds to [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]] services while its [[InterCity 225]] fleet was grounded with mechanical issues.<ref>\"GNER drafts in foreign EMUs to covers for 225s\" ''Rail'' issue 334 1 July 1998 page 9</ref> All three passed with the franchise to [[Northern Rail]] in December 2004.\n\nThe Class 321/9 units were refurbished at [[Andrew Barclay Sons & Co.|Hunslet-Barclay]], [[Kilmarnock]] from late 2006 to early 2007.<ref name=\"Railway Herald\">{{cite news | url =http://www.railwayherald.co.uk/magazine/pdf/RHUK/Issue60HIGH.pdf| title = News Desk| magazine = Railway Herald | page = 6,7 | issue = 60 | date = 3 November 2006 | accessdate = 16 July 2011}}</ref> The refurbishment included a new livery, refurbished interiors and reliability improvements, similar to the [[British Rail Class 322|Class 322]] EMUs, which were also refurbished at Kilmarnock.<ref name=\"Railway Herald \"/>\n\nThe units transferred to [[Arriva Rail North]] in April 2016, and then [[Northern Trains]] on 1 March 2020. With the Class 331s now in service, 2 of the Class 321/9s transferred to Greater Anglia, as an interim measure until their Class 720 fleet is in service, however neither unit has operated a service as of 20 April 2020.\n\n==Current operations==\n===Greater Anglia===\n[[First Great Eastern]] inherited all 66 Class 321/3s and 11 Class 321/4s. The [[East Anglia franchise]] was subsequently taken over by [[National Express East Anglia]], initially branded 'one', and then subsequently by [[Abellio Greater Anglia|Greater Anglia]]. A further 16 were added, upon release from [[London Midland]]. In 2016, 10 of the sets formerly operated by [[Thameslink and Great Northern|Great Northern]] also transferred to Greater Anglia.\n\nThese trains are primarily used for [[Liverpool Street railway station|London Liverpool Street]] to {{stnlnk|Braintree|England}}, {{stnlnk|Southend Victoria}}, {{stnlnk|Southminster}}, {{stnlnk|Ipswich}} (extending to {{stnlnk|Norwich}} during peak time), {{stnlnk|Walton-on-the-Naze}}, {{stnlnk|Clacton-on-Sea}} and [[Colchester Town railway station|Colchester Town]] but can be seen running on any electrified route if other trains fail. These operate as 4, 8 or 12 carriage sets.\n\nThey have also received 2 Class 321/9s from Northern until the [[British Rail Class 720|Class 720s]] enter service, however neither have entered service as of April 2020.\n\n=== Northern Trains ===\n[[Northern Trains]] inherited three Class 321/9 units from the previous operator, [[Arriva Rail North|Northern]]. These units operate on the [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]] to [[Doncaster railway station|Doncaster]] [[Wakefield line]] service and occasionally on the [[Wharfedale line|Wharfedale]] and [[Airedale line|Airedale]] lines alongside [[British Rail Class 322|Class 322]], [[British Rail Class 333|Class 333s]] and [[British Rail Class 331|Class 331s]]. All passed on to [[Northern Rail]] in 2004 and were refurbished in 2006/07. With the Class 331s having replaced them on Northern Trains duties, 2 of the class 321/9s moved to [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Greater Anglia]] in March 2020, however, as of April 2020, 321903 remains with Northern Trains.\n\n==Former operations==\n===Silverlink / London Midland===\n[[File:321425 A A Watford Junction.JPG|thumb|left|[[Silverlink]] liveried 321425 at {{stnlnk|Watford Junction}}]]\n[[File:321411 Watford Junction E.JPG|thumb|right|[[London Midland]] 321411 at [[Watford Junction railway station|Watford Junction]]]]\n[[Silverlink]] inherited 37 of the 48 Class 321/4 units. In September 2003, Silverlink's class 321 units were temporarily withdrawn following the discovery of loose bolts on brake discs in some units.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/entire-fleet-of-commuter-trains-withdrawn-579574.html|last=Elston|first=Laura|title=Entire fleet of commuter trains withdrawn|work=[[The Independent]]|date=11 September 2003}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2004, London Euston to Birmingham local services were divided into two separate services: Silverlink retained London to Northampton services, while fellow [[National Express]] subsidiary [[Central Trains]] taking over all local services between Northampton and Birmingham. Initially, Central Trains hired Class 321 units from Silverlink to work their new services, but the arrival of [[British Rail Class 350|Class 350/1s]] meant that very few Class 321 units were then required.\n\nTo accommodate this sub-lease, three Class 321/3 units were transferred from [[National Express East Anglia]] to Silverlink. These were not permitted north of [[Rugby railway station|Rugby]] due to lack of the National Radio Network system (Eastern Region units only had the Cab Secure Radio System used for Driver Only Operated Passenger services) and therefore could not be used on Central Trains services (although they occasionally appeared on services to Rugby at weekends due to the line being closed between Rugby and Birmingham New Street).
