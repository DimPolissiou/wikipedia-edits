The connector became standard equipment in the U.S. market due to the availability of charging stations with that plug type in the [[Electric vehicle network#United States of America|nation\u2019s electric vehicle network]] (with the help of funding such as ChargePoint America program drawing grants from provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act).\n\nThe European versions were equipped with a SAE J1772-2009 inlet as well until the automotive industry settled on the [[VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2|IEC Type 2 \u201cMennekes\u201d]] connector as the standard inlet \u2014 since all IEC connectors use the same [[#Signaling|SAE J1772 signaling protocol]] the car manufacturers are selling cars with either a SAE J1772-2009 inlet or an IEC Type 2 inlet depending on the market. There are also (passive) adapters available that can convert J1772-2009 to IEC Type 2 and vice versa. The only difference is that most European versions have an on-board charger that can take advantage of [[three-phase electric power]] with higher voltage and current limits even for the same basic electric vehicle model (such as [[Chevrolet Volt]] / Opel Ampera).\n\n===Combined Charging System (CCS)===\n[[File:Type1-ccs.svg|thumb|Type 1 CCS AC and fast DC Combo 2 connector]]\nSAE is developing a [[Combined Charging System]] with a ''Combo Coupler'' variant of the J1772-2009 connector with additional pins to accommodate fast DC charging at 200\u2013450 volts DC and up to 90&nbsp;kW.

With 1 mating cycle per day, the connector's lifespan should exceed 27 years.<ref>10,000 / 365 = 27.4</ref>\n\n===Charging===\n\nThe SAE J1772 standard defines four levels of charging in the October 2017 revision: AC Level 1, AC Level 2, DC Level 1, and DC Level 2.<ref name=J1772-2017>{{cite web|url=https://saemobilus.sae.org/content/J1772_201710/|title=SAE Electric Vehicle and Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler|publisher=[[SAE International]]|date=2017-10-13|accessdate= 2019-01-01}}</ref>\nTheir electrical ratings are specified as follows: \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

This ''AC Level 3'' mode would have used up to 96&nbsp;kW at a nominal voltage of 208 to 240 V AC and a maximum current of 400 A. On the other hand, there is no reference to a ''DC Level 3'' charge method.\n\nFor example, the 2020 [[Chevrolet Bolt]] has a 60-kWh [[lithium-ion battery]] and a 7.2-kW onboard charging module (OBCM); with an EPA range of 259 miles (417 km) and energy efficiency of 118 [[Miles per gallon gasoline equivalent|MPGe]] (5.55 km/kWh),<ref name=EPA_2020ChevroletBolt>{{cite web|url=https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=42191|title=Compare Side-by-Side - 2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV|publisher=fueleconomy.gov|author=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and [[U.S. Department of Energy]]|accessdate= 2019-01-01}}</ref> it can use its portable charge cord charge at AC Level 1 (120 V, 12 A) to get up to 4 miles (6 km) of range per hour or go off a AC Level 2 charging unit (240 V, 32 A) to get up to 25 miles (40.2 km) of range per hour. Using an optional [[charging station|DC fast charging]] (DCFC) port, this model can also charge at 50 kW (480 V DC) to get up to 90 miles (144 km) of range per half hour.\n\nSome EVs allow 120 V charging at greater than 16 amps.  This is useful, for example, at RV campgrounds where TT-30 (\"Travel Trailer\" - 120 V, 30 A) receptacles are common.  These allow charging at up to 24 amps.  However this level of 120 V charging has not been codified into J1772.\n\n===Safety===\nThe J1772 standard includes several levels of shock protection, ensuring the safety of charging even in wet conditions.  Physically, the connection pins are isolated on the interior of the connector when mated, ensuring no physical access to those pins.  When not mated, J1772 connectors have no power voltages at the pins,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gm-volt.com/2009/08/20/charging-the-chevy-volt/ |title=Charging the Chevy Volt web chat |date=2009-08-20 |website=GM-Volt.com |accessdate=2010-09-03 |quote=When a J1772 standard plug (like on the Volt) is disconnected from the vehicle, no voltage is present at the pins.}}</ref> and charging power does not flow until commanded by the vehicle.<ref name=\"sae kissel update\">{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/earthobservationsSCC/IEEE_SAE_J1772_Update_10_02_08_Gery_Kissel.pdf |title=SAE J1772 Update For IEEE Standard 1809 Guide for Electric-Sourced Transportation Infrastructure Meeting |author=Gery Kissel, SAE J1772 Task Force Lead |date=2010-02-18 |publisher=[[SAE International]] |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref>\n\nThe ground pin is of the first-make, last-break variety. If the plug is in the charging port of the vehicle and charging, and it is removed, the shorter control pilot pin will break first causing the power relay in the EVSE to open, stopping current flow to the J1772 plug. This prevents any arcing on the power pins, prolonging their lifespan. The proximity detection pin is also connected to a switch that is triggered upon pressing the physical disconnect button when removing the connector from the vehicle. This causes the resistance to change on the proximity pin which commands the vehicle's onboard charger to stop drawing current immediately. The vehicle can then release the control pilot which will cause the power relay to release.\n\n== Signaling ==\nThe signaling protocol has been designed so that<ref name=\"sae kissel update\" />\n[[Image:J1772 signaling circuit.gif|thumb|400px|J1772 signaling circuit]]\n* supply equipment signals presence of AC input power\n* vehicle detects plug via proximity circuit (thus the vehicle can prevent driving away while connected) and can detect when [[latch]] is pressed in anticipation of plug removal.\n* Control Pilot (CP) functions begin\n** supply equipment detects [[plug-in electric vehicle]] (PEV)\n** supply equipment indicates to PEV readiness to supply energy\n** PEV ventilation requirements are determined\n** supply equipment current capacity provided to PEV\n* PEV commands energy flow\n* PEV and supply equipment continuously monitor continuity of safety ground\n* charge continues as determined by PEV\n* charge may be interrupted by disconnecting the plug from the vehicle\n\nThe technical specification was described first in the 2001 version of SAE J1772 and subsequently the [[IEC 61851]]-1 and IEC TS 62763:2013. The charging station puts 12&nbsp;V on the Control Pilot (CP) and the Proximity Pilot (AKA Plug Present: PP) measuring the voltage differences. This protocol does not require integrated circuits, which would be required for other charging protocols, making the SAE J1772 robust and operable through a temperature range of \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C to +85&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n===Control Pilot===\n'''Control Pilot (Mode)''': The charging station sends a 1&nbsp;kHz [[square wave]] on the control pilot that is connected back to the protected [[earth]] on the vehicle side by means of a [[resistor]] and a [[diode]] (voltage range \u00b112.0\u00b10.4&nbsp;V). The live wires of public charging stations are always dead if the CP-PE ([[Protective earth|Protective Earth]]) circuit is open, although the standard allows a charging current as in Mode 1 (maximum 16&nbsp;A). If the circuit is closed, then the charging station can also test the protective earth to be functional. The vehicle can request a charging state by setting a resistor; using 2.7&nbsp;k\u03a9 a Mode 3 compatible vehicle is announced (''vehicle detected'') which does not require charging. Switching to 880&nbsp;\u03a9 the vehicle is ''ready'' to be charged and switching to 240&nbsp;\u03a9 the vehicle requests ''with ventilation'' charging in which case charging power is only supplied if the area is ventilated (i.e., outdoors).\n\nThe Control Pilot line circuitry examples in SAE J1772:2001 show that the current loop CP-PE is connected permanently on the vehicle side via a 2.74&nbsp;k\u03a9 resistor, making for a voltage drop from +12&nbsp;V to +9&nbsp;V when a cable is hooked up to the charging station, which activates the wave generator. The charging is activated by the vehicle by adding parallel 1.3&nbsp;k\u03a9 resistor resulting in a voltage drop to +6&nbsp;V or by adding a parallel 270&nbsp;\u03a9 resistor for a required ventilation resulting in a voltage drop to +3&nbsp;V. Hence the charging station can react by only checking the voltage range present on the CP-PE loop.<ref name=\"finalsaej1772\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/stakeholders/infrastructure/finalsaej1772.doc|title=SAE J1772 - SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charger Coupler|date=August 2001|accessdate=2012-04-09|at=Appendix A, Typical Pilot Line Circuitry}}</ref> Note that the diode will only make for a voltage drop in the positive range; any negative voltage on the CP-PE loop will shut off the current as being considered a fatal error (like touching the pins).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!

During charging, the EVSE side connects the PP-PE loop via S3 and a 150&nbsp;\u03a9 R6; when opening the release actuator a 330&nbsp;\u03a9 R7 is added in the PP-PE loop on the EVSE side which gives a voltage shift on the line to allow the electric vehicle to initiate a controlled shut off prior to actual disconnection of the charge power pins. However many low power adapter cables do not offer that locking actuator state detection on the PP pin.\n\nUnder IEC 62196 the Proximity Pin is also used to indicate the cable capacity - this is relevant for un-tethered EVSEs, more commonly found in Europe.\n\nThe resistor is coded to the maximum current capability of the cable assembly. The EVSE interrupts the current supply if the current capability of the cable is exceeded as detected by the\nmeasurement of the Rc, as defined by the values for the recommended interpretation range.\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

February 2011</ref>\n\n===Vehicle equipment===\nThe SAE J1772-2009 was adopted by the car manufacturers of [[electric vehicle#reintroduction|post-2000 electric vehicles]] like the third generation of the [[Chevrolet Volt]] and [[Nissan Leaf]] as the early models. The connector became standard equipment in the U.S. market due to the availability of charging stations with that plug type in the [[Electric vehicle network#United States of America|nation\u2019s electric vehicle network]] (with the help of funding such as ChargePoint America program drawing grants from provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act).\n\nThe European versions were equipped with a SAE J1772-2009 inlet as well until the automotive industry settled on the [[VDE-AR-E 2623-2-2|IEC Type 2 \u201cMennekes\u201d]] connector as the standard inlet \u2014 since all IEC connectors use the same [[#Signaling|SAE J1772 signaling protocol]] the car manufacturers are selling cars with either a SAE J1772-2009 inlet or an IEC Type 2 inlet depending on the market. There are also (passive) adapters available that can convert J1772-2009 to IEC Type 2 and vice versa. The only difference is that most European versions have an on-board charger that can take advantage of [[three-phase electric power]] with higher voltage and current limits even for the same basic electric vehicle model (such as [[Chevrolet Volt]] / Opel Ampera).\n\n===Combined Charging System (CCS)===\n[[File:Type1-ccs.svg|thumb|Type 1 CCS AC and fast DC Combo 2 connector]]\nSAE is developing a [[Combined Charging System]] with a ''Combo Coupler'' variant of the J1772-2009 connector with additional pins to accommodate fast DC charging at 200\u2013450 volts DC and up to 90&nbsp;kW.

The round {{convert|43|mm|in|adj=on}} diameter connector has five pins, with three different pin sizes (starting with the largest), for each of:{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n* AC line 1 and line 2\n* Ground pin\n* Proximity detection, and control pilot\n\n;Proximity detection: Provides a signal to the vehicle's control system so it can prevent movement while connected to the electric vehicle supply equipment ([[EVSE]]; i.e., the charging station), and signals the latch release button to the vehicle.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n;Control pilot: Communication line used to signal charging level between the car and the [[EVSE]], can be manipulated by vehicle to initiate charging as well as other information.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nA 1&nbsp;kHz square wave at \u00b112 volts generated by the [[EVSE]] on the control pilot line to detect the presence of the vehicle, communicate the maximum allowable charging current, and control charging begin/end.<ref>[http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/stakeholders/infrastructure/finalsaej1772.doc SAE EV Charging Systems Committee, SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler]</ref>\n\nThe connector is designed to withstand 10,000 mating cycles (a connection and a disconnection) and exposure to the elements. With 1 mating cycle per day, the connector's lifespan should exceed 27 years.<ref>10,000 / 365 = 27.4</ref>\n\n===Charging===\n\nThe SAE J1772 standard defines four levels of charging in the October 2017 revision: AC Level 1, AC Level 2, DC Level 1, and DC Level 2.<ref name=J1772-2017>{{cite web|url=https://saemobilus.sae.org/content/J1772_201710/|title=SAE Electric Vehicle and Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicle Conductive Charge Coupler|publisher=[[SAE International]]|date=2017-10-13|accessdate= 2019-01-01}}</ref>\nTheir electrical ratings are specified as follows: \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

This ''AC Level 3'' mode would have used up to 96&nbsp;kW at a nominal voltage of 208 to 240 V AC and a maximum current of 400 A. On the other hand, there is no reference to a ''DC Level 3'' charge method.\n\nFor example, the 2020 [[Chevrolet Bolt]] has a 60-kWh [[lithium-ion battery]] and a 7.2-kW onboard charging module (OBCM); with an EPA range of 259 miles (417 km) and energy efficiency of 118 [[Miles per gallon gasoline equivalent|MPGe]] (5.55 km/kWh),<ref name=EPA_2020ChevroletBolt>{{cite web|url=https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=42191|title=Compare Side-by-Side - 2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV|publisher=fueleconomy.gov|author=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and [[U.S. Department of Energy]]|accessdate= 2019-01-01}}</ref> it can use its portable charge cord charge at AC Level 1 (120 V, 12 A) to get up to 4 miles (6 km) of range per hour or go off a AC Level 2 charging unit (240 V, 32 A) to get up to 25 miles (40.2 km) of range per hour. Using an optional [[charging station|DC fast charging]] (DCFC) port, this model can also charge at 50 kW (480 V DC) to get up to 90 miles (144 km) of range per half hour.\n\nSome EVs allow 120 V charging at greater than 16 amps.  This is useful, for example, at RV campgrounds where TT-30 (\"Travel Trailer\" - 120 V, 30 A) receptacles are common.  These allow charging at up to 24 amps.  However this level of 120 V charging has not been codified into J1772.\n\n===Safety===\nThe J1772 standard includes several levels of shock protection, ensuring the safety of charging even in wet conditions.  Physically, the connection pins are isolated on the interior of the connector when mated, ensuring no physical access to those pins.  When not mated, J1772 connectors have no power voltages at the pins,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gm-volt.com/2009/08/20/charging-the-chevy-volt/ |title=Charging the Chevy Volt web chat |date=2009-08-20 |website=GM-Volt.com |accessdate=2010-09-03 |quote=When a J1772 standard plug (like on the Volt) is disconnected from the vehicle, no voltage is present at the pins.}}</ref> and charging power does not flow until commanded by the vehicle.<ref name=\"sae kissel update\">{{cite web |url=http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/earthobservationsSCC/IEEE_SAE_J1772_Update_10_02_08_Gery_Kissel.pdf |title=SAE J1772 Update For IEEE Standard 1809 Guide for Electric-Sourced Transportation Infrastructure Meeting |author=Gery Kissel, SAE J1772 Task Force Lead |date=2010-02-18 |publisher=[[SAE International]] |accessdate=2010-09-03}}</ref>\n\nThe ground pin is of the first-make, last-break variety. If the plug is in the charging port of the vehicle and charging, and it is removed, the shorter control pilot pin will break first causing the power relay in the EVSE to open, stopping current flow to the J1772 plug. This prevents any arcing on the power pins, prolonging their lifespan. The proximity detection pin is also connected to a switch that is triggered upon pressing the physical disconnect button when removing the connector from the vehicle. This causes the resistance to change on the proximity pin which commands the vehicle's onboard charger to stop drawing current immediately. The vehicle can then release the control pilot which will cause the power relay to release.\n\n== Signaling ==\nThe signaling protocol has been designed so that<ref name=\"sae kissel update\" />\n[[Image:J1772 signaling circuit.gif|thumb|400px|J1772 signaling circuit]]\n* supply equipment signals presence of AC input power\n* vehicle detects plug via proximity circuit (thus the vehicle can prevent driving away while connected) and can detect when [[latch]] is pressed in anticipation of plug removal.\n* Control Pilot (CP) functions begin\n** supply equipment detects [[plug-in electric vehicle]] (PEV)\n** supply equipment indicates to PEV readiness to supply energy\n** PEV ventilation requirements are determined\n** supply equipment current capacity provided to PEV\n* PEV commands energy flow\n* PEV and supply equipment continuously monitor continuity of safety ground\n* charge continues as determined by PEV\n* charge may be interrupted by disconnecting the plug from the vehicle\n\nThe technical specification was described first in the 2001 version of SAE J1772 and subsequently the [[IEC 61851]]-1 and IEC TS 62763:2013. The charging station puts 12&nbsp;V on the Control Pilot (CP) and the Proximity Pilot (AKA Plug Present: PP) measuring the voltage differences. This protocol does not require integrated circuits, which would be required for other charging protocols, making the SAE J1772 robust and operable through a temperature range of \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C to +85&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n===Control Pilot===\n'''Control Pilot (Mode)''': The charging station sends a 1&nbsp;kHz [[square wave]] on the control pilot that is connected back to the protected [[earth]] on the vehicle side by means of a [[resistor]] and a [[diode]] (voltage range \u00b112.0\u00b10.4&nbsp;V). The live wires of public charging stations are always dead if the CP-PE ([[Protective earth|Protective Earth]]) circuit is open, although the standard allows a charging current as in Mode 1 (maximum 16&nbsp;A). If the circuit is closed, then the charging station can also test the protective earth to be functional. The vehicle can request a charging state by setting a resistor; using 2.7&nbsp;k\u03a9 a Mode 3 compatible vehicle is announced (''vehicle detected'') which does not require charging. Switching to 880&nbsp;\u03a9 the vehicle is ''ready'' to be charged and switching to 240&nbsp;\u03a9 the vehicle requests ''with ventilation'' charging in which case charging power is only supplied if the area is ventilated (i.e., outdoors).\n\nThe Control Pilot line circuitry examples in SAE J1772:2001 show that the current loop CP-PE is connected permanently on the vehicle side via a 2.74&nbsp;k\u03a9 resistor, making for a voltage drop from +12&nbsp;V to +9&nbsp;V when a cable is hooked up to the charging station, which activates the wave generator. The charging is activated by the vehicle by adding parallel 1.3&nbsp;k\u03a9 resistor resulting in a voltage drop to +6&nbsp;V or by adding a parallel 270&nbsp;\u03a9 resistor for a required ventilation resulting in a voltage drop to +3&nbsp;V. Hence the charging station can react by only checking the voltage range present on the CP-PE loop.<ref name=\"finalsaej1772\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/zevprog/stakeholders/infrastructure/finalsaej1772.doc|title=SAE J1772 - SAE Electric Vehicle Conductive Charger Coupler|date=August 2001|accessdate=2012-04-09|at=Appendix A, Typical Pilot Line Circuitry}}</ref> Note that the diode will only make for a voltage drop in the positive range; any negative voltage on the CP-PE loop will shut off the current as being considered a fatal error (like touching the pins).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!

During charging, the EVSE side connects the PP-PE loop via S3 and a 150&nbsp;\u03a9 R6; when opening the release actuator a 330&nbsp;\u03a9 R7 is added in the PP-PE loop on the EVSE side which gives a voltage shift on the line to allow the electric vehicle to initiate a controlled shut off prior to actual disconnection of the charge power pins. However many low power adapter cables do not offer that locking actuator state detection on the PP pin.\n\n=== P1901 powerline communication ===\nIn an updated standard due in 2012, SAE proposes to use [[power line communication]], specifically [[IEEE 1901]], between the vehicle, off-board [[charging station]], and the [[smart grid]], without requiring an additional pin; SAE and the [[IEEE Standards Association]] are sharing their draft standards related to the smart grid and vehicle electrification.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sae.org/mags/aei/10128 |title=SAE's J1772 'combo connector' for ac and dc charging advances with IEEE's help |last1=Pokrzywa |first1=Jack |last2=Reidy |first2=Mary |date=2011-08-12 |work= |publisher=[[SAE International]] |access-date=2011-08-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614003155/http://www.sae.org/mags/aei/10128 |archive-date=2012-06-14 |df= }}</ref>\n\nP1901 communication is compatible with other 802.x standards via the [[IEEE 1905]] standard, allowing arbitrary IP-based communications with the vehicle, meter or distributor, and the building where chargers are located.

Instead of the usual concepts of Hollywood Week with Lines of Ten, Group Rounds, and Solo Round, this season the 167 contestants faced the Genre Challenge. The contestants choose from genres given, Pop, Rock, R&B, Soul, Country, and Singer-Songwriter, and picked a song and were assessed amongst their group. After all  performed, the judges brought the contestants to stage, similar to Lines of Ten, and made their decision. The Group Round was replaced with a Duet Round, in which the remaining contestants picked a duet partner and their song from a list provided. They were given twelve hours to rehearse including a session with a vocal coach, and later, a stage rehearsal. The judges decided if one, both, or neither moved to the Solo Round for which the remaining contestants performed with a backing band. The Top 40 were flown to Hawaii for a Showcase round to determine the Top Twenty advancing to the live shows.\n\n== Showcase Round ==\nThe Showcase Round will air on March 29 and April 5, which will feature the top forty performing for the judges and a live audience at [[Aulani]] resort in [[Kapolei, Hawaii]]. The following day, the judges narrowed the number of contestants down to twenty in the Final Judgement. The following is a list of the contestants who performed, the song they performed at the Showcase, and if they advanced or not:\n\n'''Color key:'''\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 90%; white-space: nowrap;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:cyan; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Male contestant\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"background:pink; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Female contestant\n|-\n| style=\"background:#B0E0E6; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Contestant was chosen by the judges to move on to the Top 20\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF91A4; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Contestant was eliminated\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; line-height:17px; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:4%;\"| Order\n! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:18%;\"| Contestant<ref name=\"ShowcasePart1TVLine\">{{Cite web |url=https://tvline.com/2020/03/29/american-idol-recap-season-18-top-20-dillon-james/ |title=''American Idol'' Recap: Did Your Favorite Singers Survive the 'Final Judgment'?

Instead of the usual concepts of Hollywood Week with Lines of Ten, Group Rounds, and Solo Round, this season the 167 contestants faced the Genre Challenge. The contestants choose from genres given, Pop, Rock, R&B, Soul, Country, and Singer-Songwriter, and picked a song and were assessed amongst their group. After all  performed, the judges brought the contestants to stage, similar to Lines of Ten, and made their decision. The Group Round was replaced with a Duet Round, in which the remaining contestants picked a duet partner and their song from a list provided. They were given twelve hours to rehearse including a session with a vocal coach, and later, a stage rehearsal. The judges decided if one, both, or neither moved to the Solo Round for which the remaining contestants performed with a backing band. The Top 40 were flown to Hawaii for a Showcase round to determine the Top Twenty advancing to the live shows.\n\n== Showcase Round ==\nThe Showcase Round will air on March 29 and April 5, which will feature the top forty performing for the judges and a live audience at [[Aulani]] resort in [[Kapolei, Hawaii]].

He attended Indian Land High School before leaving for [[Clemson University]], where he claimed 11 All-America honors and three National Championships. wow\n\nIn a successful 2001 Crawford started the year with a victory at the [[IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics|Indoor World Championships]] in the 200 m. He then went to the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Athletics Championships]], where he tied with [[Kim Collins]] of [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] for the 200 m [[bronze medal]]. He then travelled to the [[Goodwill Games]], where he claimed his second gold medal of the year.\n\nThe next two years of Crawford's career were most memorable for his outrageous antics and lack of focus. At a 2002 meet in [[Milan]], he put on a [[Phantom of the Opera]] mask just prior to the beginning of his 200 m race. The mask became dislodged during the race obstructing his vision and causing him to run out of his lane and be disqualified.<ref name=SanDiego>{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040823/news_lz1x23sulli.html |title=Crawford's the happiest, fastest guy out of the medals in the 100 |accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref> He claimed to have tested the mask in advance by sticking his head out of a car window while wearing it.\n\nIn January 2003, Crawford starred in an episode of the [[Fox TV]] show ''[[Man vs. Beast]]'' in which he raced a zebra and a giraffe over 100 m on dirt. In the first race he easily bested the giraffe (which was separated from him by a metal fence and may have been a bit disoriented). The zebra race was very close with the zebra slowly pulling ahead for victory. Accusing the zebra of a false start, he re-raced the zebra getting out of the blocks first and taking a lead.

He attended Indian Land High School before leaving for [[Clemson University]], where he claimed 11 All-America honors and three National Championships.\n\nIn a successful 2001 Crawford started the year with a victory at the [[IAAF World Indoor Championships in Athletics|Indoor World Championships]] in the 200 m. He then went to the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Athletics Championships]], where he tied with [[Kim Collins]] of [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] for the 200 m [[bronze medal]]. He then travelled to the [[Goodwill Games]], where he claimed his second gold medal of the year.\n\nThe next two years of Crawford's career were most memorable for his outrageous antics and lack of focus. At a 2002 meet in [[Milan]], he put on a [[Phantom of the Opera]] mask just prior to the beginning of his 200 m race. The mask became dislodged during the race obstructing his vision and causing him to run out of his lane and be disqualified.<ref name=SanDiego>{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040823/news_lz1x23sulli.html |title=Crawford's the happiest, fastest guy out of the medals in the 100 |accessdate=2007-07-27}}</ref> He claimed to have tested the mask in advance by sticking his head out of a car window while wearing it.\n\nIn January 2003, Crawford starred in an episode of the [[Fox TV]] show ''[[Man vs. Beast]]'' in which he raced a zebra and a giraffe over 100 m on dirt. In the first race he easily bested the giraffe (which was separated from him by a metal fence and may have been a bit disoriented). The zebra race was very close with the zebra slowly pulling ahead for victory. Accusing the zebra of a false start, he re-raced the zebra getting out of the blocks first and taking a lead. This caused the zebra to speed up, finishing in 9.957s to Crawford's 10.86s time. Later he boasted to ''[[ESPN the Magazine]]'', \"tell the zebra I coulda whooped him.\"<ref name=SanDiego /> According to the [[USATF]] website Crawford refers to himself as \"Cheetah Man.\" He has publicly expressed his desire to run in war paint and urges spectators to look out for him at every meet.\n\nAfter the relatively unsuccessful and unfocused 2002 and 2003 Crawford burst back in March 2004, where he was fancied for the [[60 metres|60 meters]] world indoor title. However, he came up against an in-form [[Jason Gardener]] from [[Great Britain]], who edged him into the silver medal position by three hundredths of a second.\n\nIn the trials for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] Crawford gained his place in the team by claiming third in the 100 m with a personal best of 9.93s behind winner [[Maurice Greene (athlete)|Maurice Greene]] and second placed [[Justin Gatlin]], but bettered that seven days later with first place in the 200 m with a time of 19.99s, this time pushing Gatlin into second with [[Bernard Williams (sprinter)|Bernard Williams]] taking third.

The airport is located {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Downtown Port of Spain]], located in the adjacent town of [[Piarco]]. It is the seventh busiest airport in the Caribbean in terms of passengers served<ref>[[List of the busiest airports in the Caribbean]]</ref> and third busiest in the [[English-speaking Caribbean]], after [[Sangster International Airport]] and [[Lynden Pindling International Airport]]. The airport is also the primary hub and operating base for the country's national airline, as well as the Caribbean's largest airline, [[Caribbean Airlines]].\n\nThe international airport acts as a major central hub for the state-owned regional airline, Caribbean Airlines, the largest in the Caribbean, which is owned by the '''Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.'''\n\nPiarco International Airport has direct scheduled service to destinations in the United States, Canada, Central America, South America and Europe. It is also a significant transit hub for the [[Southern Caribbean]] and serves as the primary connection point for many passengers travelling from [[Guyana]].\n\n==History==\nPiarco Airport opened on 8 January 1931, to serve [[Venezuela]]'s ''Compagnie Generale Aeropostale''. Before this, the Queen's Park Savannah, the Mucarapo Field, and the Cocorite Docks (for [[flying boat]]s) were used as airstrips to serve the island.\n\nIn [[World War II]] the original airfield was used to house the Royal Navy Observer School HMS ''Goshawk''. From 1942 it was also used by both the [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Sixth Air Force]] and [[United States Navy]] air squadrons. The airport was used both as a transport airfield and also for antisubmarine patrol flights over the south Caribbean. It was returned to civil control after the war.\n\nIn [[World War II]] the [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Sixth Air Force]] stationed the following units at the airport performing antisubmarine patrols:\n*[[1st Reconnaissance Squadron|1st Bombardment Squadron]] ([[9th Bombardment Group]]) 24 April{{snd}}29 October 1941 (B-18 Bolo)\n*[[10th Missile Squadron|10th Bombardment Squadron]] ([[25th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing|25th Bombardment Group]]) 27 August{{snd}}12 October 1943 (B-18 Bolo)\n*[[35th Bombardment Squadron]] ([[25th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing|25th Bombardment Group]]) 27 August{{snd}}12 October 1943 (B-18 Bolo)\n\n==Modern day==\nA major expansion of the airport, which included the construction of a new terminal building, and high-speed taxiways, was completed in 2001. The old airport building is currently used for cargo handling. Piarco International Airport is also the primary hub and operating base of [[Caribbean Airlines]] and was also the primary hub and operating base of the now defunct [[BWIA West Indies Airways]] and [[Air Caribbean (Trinidad and Tobago)|Air Caribbean]]. Briko Air Services And Aerial World Services operate a flight school at the airport.\n\nIn 2006 the Airports Authority of Trinidad And Tobago commissioned a study for land use planning and urban development planning. All-Inclusive Project Development Services Limited was commissioned to conduct the study. The study was completed in October 2007 and approved by the Board. In 2011, work on the infrastructure of the North Aviation Business Park began. It is completed in 2013.\n\nIn December 2019, the European Union gave a loan of 4 million euros for construction of a solar park at the airport with an annual generation capacity of 1,443,830 kWh. The project is slated to begin construction in Q1 2020.\n\nIn 2019, Piarco International Airport was named best airport in the Caribbean and 3rd best in the Caribbean and Latin American Regions.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:StepUp.jpg|thumb|Apron view]]\n[[File:Piarco International Airport Atrium.jpg|thumb|Main atrium]]\n[[File:Piarco Airport checkinterminal2016.jpg|thumb|Check-in area]]\nAt Piarco International Airport there are two high-speed taxiways and three connector taxiways (ICAO Code F for new large aircraft).

The airport is located {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Downtown Port of Spain]], located in the adjacent town of [[Piarco]]. It is the seventh busiest airport in the Caribbean in terms of passengers served<ref>[[List of the busiest airports in the Caribbean]]</ref> and third busiest in the [[English-speaking Caribbean]], after [[Sangster International Airport]] and [[Lynden Pindling International Airport]]. The airport is also the primary hub and operating base for the country's national airline, as well as the Caribbean's largest airline, [[Caribbean Airlines]].\n\nThe international airport acts as a major central hub for the state-owned regional airline, Caribbean Airlines, the largest in the Caribbean, which owned by the '''Government of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.'''\n\nPiarco International Airport has direct scheduled service to destinations in the United States, Canada, Central America, South America and Europe. It is also a significant transit hub for the [[Southern Caribbean]] and serves as the primary connection point for many passengers travelling from [[Guyana]].\n\n==History==\nPiarco Airport opened on 8 January 1931, to serve [[Venezuela]]'s ''Compagnie Generale Aeropostale''. Before this, the Queen's Park Savannah, the Mucarapo Field, and the Cocorite Docks (for [[flying boat]]s) were used as airstrips to serve the island.\n\nIn [[World War II]] the original airfield was used to house the Royal Navy Observer School HMS ''Goshawk''. From 1942 it was also used by both the [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Sixth Air Force]] and [[United States Navy]] air squadrons. The airport was used both as a transport airfield and also for antisubmarine patrol flights over the south Caribbean. It was returned to civil control after the war.\n\nIn [[World War II]] the [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Sixth Air Force]] stationed the following units at the airport performing antisubmarine patrols:\n*[[1st Reconnaissance Squadron|1st Bombardment Squadron]] ([[9th Bombardment Group]]) 24 April{{snd}}29 October 1941 (B-18 Bolo)\n*[[10th Missile Squadron|10th Bombardment Squadron]] ([[25th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing|25th Bombardment Group]]) 27 August{{snd}}12 October 1943 (B-18 Bolo)\n*[[35th Bombardment Squadron]] ([[25th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing|25th Bombardment Group]]) 27 August{{snd}}12 October 1943 (B-18 Bolo)\n\n==Modern day==\nA major expansion of the airport, which included the construction of a new terminal building, and high-speed taxiways, was completed in 2001. The old airport building is currently used for cargo handling. Piarco International Airport is also the primary hub and operating base of [[Caribbean Airlines]] and was also the primary hub and operating base of the now defunct [[BWIA West Indies Airways]] and [[Air Caribbean (Trinidad and Tobago)|Air Caribbean]]. Briko Air Services And Aerial World Services operate a flight school at the airport.\n\nIn 2006 the Airports Authority of Trinidad And Tobago commissioned a study for land use planning and urban development planning. All-Inclusive Project Development Services Limited was commissioned to conduct the study. The study was completed in October 2007 and approved by the Board. In 2011, work on the infrastructure of the North Aviation Business Park began. It is completed in 2013.\n\nIn December 2019, the European Union gave a loan of 4 million euros for construction of a solar park at the airport with an annual generation capacity of 1,443,830 kWh. The project is slated to begin construction in Q1 2020.\n\nIn 2019, Piarco International Airport was named best airport in the Caribbean and 3rd best in the Caribbean and Latin American Regions.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:StepUp.jpg|thumb|Apron view]]\n[[File:Piarco International Airport Atrium.jpg|thumb|Main atrium]]\n[[File:Piarco Airport checkinterminal2016.jpg|thumb|Check-in area]]\nAt Piarco International Airport there are two high-speed taxiways and three connector taxiways (ICAO Code F for new large aircraft).

They released their seventh work, a \"book album\" entitled ''[[Map the Soul|\u9b42: Map the Soul]],'' on March 27 and distributed it exclusively on Epik High's website. Tablo stated that ''\u9b42: Map the Soul'' is not the group's official sixth album, but a special project.\n\nMusic videos for the single \"Map the Soul\" were released on May 19, with worldwide and Korean versions. To commemorate their first release under the independent label, Epik High toured in Japan and performed at Melon Ax in Seoul with [[Kero One]] and MYK.
