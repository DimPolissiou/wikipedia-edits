The [[Reconquista]] against [[Al Andalus]] (ending in 1492), the establishment of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] (1478) and the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|expulsion of Jews]] (1492) were highly relevant in the union of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] under the ''[[Catholic Monarchs]]'' [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Fernando]] (1492), followed by the persecution and eventual [[expulsion of the Moriscos]] in 1609. The [[Counter-Reformation]] (1563\u20131648) was especially strong in Spain and the Inquisition was not definitively abolished until 1834, thus keeping Islam, Judaism, Protestantism and [[Enlightenment in Spain|parts of the Enlightenment]] at bay for most of its history.\n\n=== Antiquity and late Antiquity ===\n{{VT|History of Early Christianity|History of the Catholic Church|Constantine the Great and Christianity|Visigothic Kingdom|Councils of Toledo}}\n[[Image:Le Temple de Diane vue lat\u00e9rale et frontale.JPG|thumb|left|The rebuilt [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] temple of Diana in [[Emerita Augusta|M\u00e9rida]]]]\nBefore Christianity, there were multiple beliefs in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] including local [[Iberians|Iberian]], [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] religions, as well as the [[Hellenistic religion|Greco]]-[[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]].\n \nAccording to [[Historia Compostelana|a medieval legend]], the [[James, son of Zebedee|apostle James]] was the first to spread Christianity in the [[Hispania|Roman Iberian Peninsula]].

The Council of Lerida in 546 constrained the clergy and extended the power of law over them under the blessings of Rome. The multiple [[Councils of Toledo]] definitively established what would be later known as the Catholic Church in Spain and contributed to define Catholicism elsewhere.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{VT|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Al-Andalus|Reconquista}}\nBy the early 8th century, the Visigothic kingdom had fragmented and the fragments were in disarray, bankrupt and willing to accept external help to fight each other. In 711 an [[Arab]] raiding party led by [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]] crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], then defeated the Visigothic king [[Roderic]] at the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Tariq's commander, [[Musa bin Nusair]], then landed with substantial reinforcements. Taking advantage of the Visigoths' infighting, by 718 the Muslims dominated most of the peninsula, establishing Islamic rule until 1492. \n[[Image:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba]] turned church after the [[Reconquista]].]]\nDuring this period the number of Muslims increased greatly through the migration of Arabs and Berbers, and the conversion of local Christians to Islam (known as [[Muladi]]s or Muwalladun) with the latter forming the majority of the Islamic-ruled area by the end of the 10th century. Most Christians who remained adopted Arabic culture, and these Arabized Christians became known as [[Mozarabs]]. While under the status of ''[[dhimmi]]s'' the Christian and Jewish subjects had to pay higher taxes than Muslims and could not hold positions of power over Muslims.\n\nThe era of Muslim rule before 1055 is often considered a \"Golden Age\" for the Jews as Jewish intellectual and spiritual life flourished in Spain.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sephardim|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|author=Rebecca Weiner|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html}}</ref> Only in the northern fringes of the peninsula did Christians remain under Christian rule.

[[Emirate of Granada|Granada]], the last Muslim redoubt, was eventually reconquered on January 2, 1492, 781 years after Tariq's first landing.\n\n=== Modern period ===\nIn the Early Modern Period, Spain saw itself as the bulwark of Catholicism and doctrinal purity. Spain carried Catholicism to the New World and to the Philippines, but the Spanish kings insisted on independence from papal \"interference\"\u2014bishops in the Spanish domains were forbidden to report to the Pope except through the Spanish crown. In the 18th century, Spanish rulers drew further from the papacy, banishing the [[Jesuits]] from their empire in 1767. The Spanish authorities abolished the Inquisition in the 1830s, but even after that, [[religious freedom]] was denied in practice, if not in theory.\n\n=== Concordat of 1851 ===\nCatholicism became the state religion in 1851, when the Spanish government signed a [[Concordat]] with the [[Holy See]] that committed [[Madrid]] to pay the salaries of the clergy and to subsidize other expenses of the Roman Catholic Church as a compensation for the seizure of church property in the ''[[Desamortizaci\u00f3n de Mendiz\u00e1bal]]'' of 1835-1837. This pact was renounced in 1931, when the secular constitution of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] imposed a series of anticlerical measures that threatened the Church's hegemony in Spain, provoking the Church's support for the [[Francisco Franco]] uprising five years later.<ref name=\"LOCprof2\">Text used in this cited section originally came from: [http://rs6.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html Spain Country Study] from the [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] project.\n</ref> In the ensuing [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], alleged communists and anarchists in Republican areas killed about [[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|7,000 priests]], the majority murdered between July and December 1936.

During the Franco years, Roman Catholicism was the only religion to have legal status; other worship services could not be advertised, and no other religion could own property or publish books. The Government not only continued to pay priests' salaries and to subsidize the Church, it also assisted in the reconstruction of church buildings damaged by the war. Laws were passed abolishing divorce and civil marriages as well as banning abortion and the sale of contraceptives. Homosexuality and all other forms of sexual permissiveness were also banned.  Catholic religious instruction was mandatory, even in public schools. Franco secured in return the right to name Roman Catholic bishops in Spain, as well as veto power over appointments of clergy down to the parish priest level.\n\nIn 1953 this close cooperation was formalized in a [[Concordat of 1953|new Concordat]] with the Vatican that granted the church an extraordinary set of privileges: mandatory canonical marriages for all Catholics; exemption from government taxation; subsidies for new building construction; censorship of materials the Church deemed offensive; the right to establish universities, to operate radio stations, and to publish newspapers and magazines; protection from police intrusion into church properties; and exemption of military service.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nThe proclamation of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in favor of religious freedom in 1965 provided more rights to other religious denominations in Spain. In the late 1960s, the Vatican attempted to reform the Church in Spain by appointing interim, or acting, bishops, thereby circumventing Franco's stranglehold on the country's clergy. Many young priests, under foreign influence, became [[worker priest]]s and participated in anti-regime agitation. Many of them ended as leftist politicians, with some imprisoned in the [[Concordat prison]] reserved for priest prisoners. In 1966, the Franco regime passed a law that freed other religions from many of the earlier restrictions, but the law also reaffirmed the privileges of the Catholic Church.

Church property not used for religious purposes was henceforth to be subject to taxation, and over a period of years the Church's reliance on state subsidies was to be gradually reduced. The timetable for this reduction was not adhered to, however, and the church continued to receive the public subsidy through 1987 (US$110 million in that year alone).<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIt took the new [[1978 Spanish Constitution]] to confirm the right of Spaniards to religious freedom and to begin the process of disestablishing Catholicism as the state religion. The drafters of the Constitution tried to deal with the intense controversy surrounding state support of the Church, but they were not entirely successful. The initial draft of the Constitution did not even mention the Church, which was included almost as an afterthought and only after intense pressure from the church's leadership. Article 16 disestablishes Roman Catholicism as the official religion and provides that religious liberty for non-Catholics is a state-protected legal right, thereby replacing the policy of limited toleration of non-Catholic religious practices. The article further states, however, that: \"The public authorities shall take the religious beliefs of Spanish society into account and shall maintain the consequent relations of cooperation with the Catholic Church and the other confessions.\" In addition, Article 27 also aroused controversy by appearing to pledge continuing government subsidies for private, Church-affiliated schools. These schools were sharply criticized by Spanish Socialists for having created and perpetuated a class-based, separate, and unequal school system. The Constitution, however, includes no affirmation that the majority of Spaniards are Catholics or that the state should take into account the teachings of Catholicism.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" /> The Constitution declares Spain a \"non-confessional\" state, however it is not a ''[[la\u00efque]]'' (secular) state like [[Catholic Church in France|France]] or [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Mexico]].\n\nGovernment financial aid to the Catholic Church was a difficult and contentious issue. The Church argued that, in return for the subsidy, the state had received the social, health, and educational services of tens of thousands of priests and nuns who fulfilled vital functions that the state itself could not have performed at that time. Nevertheless, the revised Concordat was supposed to replace direct state aid to the church with a scheme that would allow taxpayers to designate a certain portion of their taxes to be diverted directly to the Church. Through 1985, taxpayers were allowed to deduct up to 10 percent from their taxable income for donations to the Catholic Church. Partly because of the protests against this arrangement from representatives of Spain's other religious groups and even from some Catholics, the tax laws were changed in 2007 so that taxpayers could choose between giving 0.52 percent of their income tax to the church and allocating it to the government's welfare and culture budgets. For three years, the government would continue to give the Church a gradually reduced subsidy, but after that the church would have to subsist on its own resources. The government would continue, however, its program of subsidizing Catholic schools, which in 1987 cost the Spanish taxpayers about US$300 million exclusive of the salaries of teachers, which were paid directly by the Ministry of Education and Science.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIn a population of about 39 million at the beginning of [[Spanish transition to democracy|Transition]] (begun in November 1975), the number of non-Catholics was probably no more than 300,000. About 290,000 of these were of other Christian faiths, including several Protestant denominations, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Spain|Mormons]]. The number of Jews in Spain was estimated at about 13,000 in the\n[[Murcia Jewish community]]. More than 19 out of every 20 Spaniards were baptized Catholics; about 60 percent of them attended Mass; about 30 percent of the baptized Catholics did so regularly, although this figure declined to about 20 percent in the larger cities. In 1979, about 97 percent of all marriages were performed according to the Catholic rite. A 1982 report by the church claimed that 82 percent of all children born the preceding year had been baptized in the church.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nNevertheless, there were forces at work bringing about fundamental changes in the place of the church in society. One such force was the improvement in the economic fortunes of the great majority of Spaniards, making society more [[materialistic]] and less religious. Another force was the massive shift in population from farm and village to the growing urban centers, where the church had less influence over the values of its members. These changes were transforming the way Spaniards defined their religious identity.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nBeing a Catholic in Spain had less and less to do with regular attendance at [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] and more to do with the routine observance of important rituals such as baptism, marriage, and burial of the dead. A 1980 survey revealed that, although 82 percent of Spaniards were believers in Catholicism, very few considered themselves to be very good practitioners of the faith. In the case of the youth of the country, even smaller percentages believed themselves to be \"very good\" or \"practicing\" Catholics.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIn contrast to an earlier era, when rejection of the church went along with education, in the late 1980s studies showed that the more educated a person was, the more likely he or she was to be a practicing Catholic. This new acceptance of the church was due partly to the church's new self-restraint in politics. In a significant change from the pre-Civil War era, the church had accepted the need for the separation of religion and the state, and it had even discouraged the creation of a Christian Democratic party in the country.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n[[Image:Presidente de Espa\u00f1a Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero en el Senado en marzo de 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]], an openly agnostic<ref name=ZAPATERO>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2008/06/29/domingo/1214711557_850215.html|title=\"'Miembras' abri\u00f3 el debate.

Although the Socialist leadership professed [[agnosticism]], according to surveys between 40 and 45 percent of the party's rank-and-file members held religious beliefs, and more than 70 percent of these professed to be Catholics. Among those entering the party after Franco's death, about half considered themselves Catholic.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nOne important indicator of the changes taking place in the role of the church was the reduction in the number of Spaniards in Holy Orders. In 1984 the country had more than 22,000 parish priests, nearly 10,000 ordained monks, and nearly 75,000 nuns. These numbers concealed a troubling reality, however. More than 70 percent of the diocesan clergy was between the ages of 35 and 65; the average age of the clergy in 1982 was 49 years. At the upper end of the age range, the low numbers reflected the impact of the Civil War, in which more than 4,000 parish priests died. At the lower end, the scarcity of younger priests reflected the general crisis in vocations throughout the world, which began to be felt in the 1960s. Its effects were felt very acutely in Spain. The crisis was seen in the decline in the number of young men joining the priesthood and in the increase in the number of priests leaving Holy Orders. The number of [[Seminary|seminarians]] in Spain fell from more than 9,000 in the 1950s to only 1,500 in 1979, even though it rose slightly in 1982 to about 1,700.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" /> In 2008, there were just 1,221 students in these theological schools.<ref name=SEMINARISTAS09>{{cite web|url=http://www.conferenciaepiscopal.es/seminarios/2009/Estadisticas.pdf|title=Estad\u00edsticas \"D\u00eda del Seminario\" 2009, Conferencia Episcopal Espa\u00f1ola|accessdate=2009-03-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530002400/http://www.conferenciaepiscopal.es/seminarios/2009/Estadisticas.pdf|archivedate=2009-05-30}}</ref>\n\nChanges in the social meaning of religious vocations were perhaps part of the problem; having a priest in the family no longer seemed to spark the kind of pride that family members would have felt in the past. The principal reason in most cases, though, was the church's continued ban on marriage for priests. Previously, the crisis was not particularly serious because of the age distribution of the clergy. As the twentieth century neared an end, however, a serious imbalance appeared between those entering the priesthood and those leaving it. The effects of this crisis were already visible in the decline in the number of parish priests in Spain\u2014from 23,620 in 1979 to just over 22,000 by 1983<ref name=\"LOCprof\" /> and 19,307 in 2005.<ref name=\"ESTADISTICA2005\" /> New ordinations also dropped 19% from 241 in 1998 to 196 in 2008, with all-time record lows of 168 priests out of 45 million Spaniards taking their vows in 2007.<ref name=\"SEMINARISTAS09\" /><ref name=ESTADISTICA2007>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastoral-vocacional.org/acontecimientos_vocacionales/estadis2007MA.html|title=Acontecimientos Vocacionales, estad\u00edstica de seminarios mayores 2007.

Opus Dei, a worldwide lay religious body, did not adhere to any particular political philosophy. Its founder, [[Jose Maria Escriva de Balaguer y Albas]], stated that the organization was nonpolitical. The organization was founded in 1928 as a reaction to the increasing secularization of Spain's universities, and higher education continued to be one of the institute's foremost priorities. Despite its public commitment to a nonpolitical stance, Opus Dei members rose to occupy key positions in the Franco r\u00e9gime, especially in the field of economic policy-making in the late 1950s and the early 1960s. Opus Dei members dominated the group of liberal technocrats who engineered the opening of Spain's [[Autarky|autarchic economy]] after 1957. After the 1973 assassination of Prime Minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] (often rumored to be an Opus Dei member), however, the influence of the institute declined sharply. The secrecy of the order and its activities and the power of its myth helped it maintain its strong position of influence in Spain; but there was little doubt that, compared with the 1950s and the 1960s, Opus Dei had fallen from being one of the country's chief political organizations to being simply one among many such groups competing for power in an open and pluralist society.<ref name=LOCprof>{{cite book |last1=Solsten |first1=Eric |last2=Meditz |first2=Sandra |date=1990 |title=Spain: A Country Study |url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/frdcstdy.spaincountrystud00sols_0/ |location= |publisher=United States [[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division |page=115 |isbn=9780160285509 |lccn=90006127}}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nAn important number of Latin American immigrants, who are usually strong Catholic practitioners, have helped the Catholic Church to recover part of the attendance that regular Masses (Sunday Mass) used to have in the sixties and seventies and that was lost in the eighties among native Spaniards.\n\nSince 2003, the involvement of the Catholic Church in political affairs, through special groups such as [[Opus Dei]], the [[Neocatechumenal Way]] or the [[Legion of Christ]], especially personated through important politicians in the right-wing People's Party, has increased again. Old and new media, which are property of the Church, such as the [[Cadena COPE|COPE]] radio network or [[:es:Trece (canal de televisi\u00f3n)|13 TV]], have also contributed to this new involvement in politics by their own admission.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Un informe de la Iglesia califica a 13TV de \"culturalmente pobre\", af\u00edn al PP y para \"la tercera edad\"|url=http://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/encargado-denuncia-television-eminentemente-definida_0_518998732.html|accessdate=15 November 2017|publisher = eldiario.es|language=es}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://bluper.elespanol.com/noticias/iglesia-califica-13tv-afin-pp-culturalmente-pobre|title=La Iglesia califica a 13 TV como af\u00edn al PP y para \"la tercera edad\" {{!}} Bluper|accessdate=15 November 2017|publisher = bluper.elespanol.com|language=es}}</ref> The Church is no longer seen as a neutral and independent institution in political affairs and it is generally aligned with the opinion and politics of the People's Party.

The [[Reconquista]] against [[Al Andalus]] (ending in 1492), the establishment of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] (1478) and the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|expulsion of Jews]] (1492) were highly relevant in the union of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] under the ''[[Catholic Monarchs]]'' [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabel]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Fernando]] (1492), followed by the persecution and eventual [[expulsion of the Moriscos]] in 1609. The [[Counter-Reformation]] (1563\u20131648) was especially strong in Spain and the Inquisition was not definitively abolished until 1834, thus keeping Islam, Judaism, Protestantism and [[Enlightenment in Spain|parts of the Enlightenment]] at bay for most of its history.\n\n=== Antiquity and late Antiquity ===\n{{VT|History of Early Christianity|History of the Catholic Church|Constantine the Great and Christianity|Visigothic Kingdom|Councils of Toledo}}\n[[Image:Le Temple de Diane vue lat\u00e9rale et frontale.JPG|thumb|left|The rebuilt [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] temple of Diana in [[Emerita Augusta|M\u00e9rida]]]]\nBefore Christianity, there were multiple beliefs in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] including local [[Iberians|Iberian]], [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] religions, as well as the [[Hellenistic religion|Greco]]-[[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]].\n \nAccording to [[Historia Compostelana|a medieval legend]], the [[James, son of Zebedee|apostle James]] was the first to spread Christianity in the [[Hispania|Roman Iberian Peninsula]]. There is no factual evidence of this{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} but he later became the [[patron saint]] of Spaniards and Portuguese, originating the [[Camino de Santiago|Way of St James]]. According to [[Romans 15]], [[Paul the Apostle]] also intended to visit Hispania; tradition has that he did and founded the [[:es:Di\u00f3cesis de \u00c9cija|Diocese of \u00c9cija]], but there is no evidence of this either.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Other later myths include the [[Seven Apostolic Men]].\n\nThere is some archaeological evidence of Christianity slowly penetrating the Peninsula from Rome and [[Mauretania|Roman Mauretania]] via major cities and ports, especially [[Tarraco|Tarragona]], since the early [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]]. The [[:ca:Necr\u00f2polis paleocristiana de Tarragona|Paleo-Christian Necropolis of Tarragona]], with 2,050 discovered tombs, dates back to the second half of the 3rd century. Saints like [[Eulalia of M\u00e9rida]] or [[Eulalia of Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[:Category:Saints from Hispania|many others]] are believed to have been martyred during the [[Decian persecution|Decian]] or [[Diocletianic Persecution]]s ([[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd]]\u2013early [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th]] centuries). [[Bishop]]s like [[:es:Bas\u00edlides de Astorga|Bas\u00edlides of Astorga]], [[:es:Marcial de M\u00e9rida|Marcial of M\u00e9rida]] or the influential [[Hosius of Corduba]] were active in the same period.\n\n[[Theodosius I]] issued decrees that effectively made [[Nicene Christianity]] the official [[state church of the Roman Empire]].,<ref>''Cf. decree, infra''.</ref><ref name=\"EdictOfThessolonica\">\"Edict of Thessalonica\": See Codex Theodosianus XVI.1.2</ref> This Christianity was already an early form of Catholicism.\n[[Image:SanPedroNave1.jpg|thumb|The 7th-century Visigothic church of [[San Pedro de la Nave]]]]\nAs [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] declined, [[Migration Period|Germanic tribes invaded]] most of the lands of the former empire.

The [[Visigoths#Visigothic kingdom in Hispania|Visigothic Kingdom]] established its capital in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]; it reached its high point during the reign of [[Leovigild]] (568-586). Visigothic rule led to a brief expansion of [[Arianism]] in Spain, however the native population remained staunchly Catholic.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In 587 [[Reccared]], the Visigothic king at Toledo, converted to Catholicism  and launched a movement to unify doctrine. The Council of Lerida in 546 constrained the clergy and extended the power of law over them under the blessings of Rome. The multiple [[Councils of Toledo]] definitively established what would be later known as the Catholic Church in Spain and contributed to define Catholicism elsewhere.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{VT|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Al-Andalus|Reconquista}}\nBy the early 8th century, the Visigothic kingdom had fragmented and the fragments were in disarray, bankrupt and willing to accept external help to fight each other. In 711 an [[Arab]] raiding party led by [[Tariq ibn-Ziyad]] crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], then defeated the Visigothic king [[Roderic]] at the [[Battle of Guadalete]]. Tariq's commander, [[Musa bin Nusair]], then landed with substantial reinforcements. Taking advantage of the Visigoths' infighting, by 718 the Muslims dominated most of the peninsula, establishing Islamic rule until 1492. \n[[Image:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba]] turned church after the [[Reconquista]].]]\nDuring this period the number of Muslims increased greatly through the migration of Arabs and Berbers, and the conversion of local Christians to Islam (known as [[Muladi]]s or Muwalladun) with the latter forming the majority of the Islamic-ruled area by the end of the 10th century. Most Christians who remained adopted Arabic culture, and these Arabized Christians became known as [[Mozarabs]]. While under the status of ''[[dhimmi]]s'' the Christian and Jewish subjects had to pay higher taxes than Muslims and could not hold positions of power over Muslims.\n\nThe era of Muslim rule before 1055 is often considered a \"Golden Age\" for the Jews as Jewish intellectual and spiritual life flourished in Spain.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sephardim|publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]|author=Rebecca Weiner|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Sephardim.html}}</ref> Only in the northern fringes of the peninsula did Christians remain under Christian rule.

In 1147, when the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] took control of Muslim Andalusian territories, they reversed the earlier tolerant attitude and treated Christians harshly.

Christianity and the Catholic Church helped shape the re-establishment of European rule over Iberia.\n[[File:01 Antequera, Andalusia, Spain.jpg|thumb|[[:es:Real Colegiata de Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor|Royal Collegiate Church of Santa Mar\u00eda la Mayor]] in [[Antequera]], [[Andalusia]]]]\nAfter centuries of the [[Reconquista]], in which Christian Spaniards fought to drive out the [[Moors|Muslims]], King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] established the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in 1478, a religious purge of Muslim and Jewish thought and practice, from the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. [[Emirate of Granada|Granada]], the last Muslim redoubt, was eventually reconquered on January 2, 1492, 781 years after Tariq's first landing.\n\n=== Modern period ===\nIn the Early Modern Period, Spain saw itself as the bulwark of Catholicism and doctrinal purity. Spain carried Catholicism to the New World and to the Philippines, but the Spanish kings insisted on independence from papal \"interference\"\u2014bishops in the Spanish domains were forbidden to report to the Pope except through the Spanish crown. In the 18th century, Spanish rulers drew further from the papacy, banishing the [[Jesuits]] from their empire in 1767. The Spanish authorities abolished the Inquisition in the 1830s, but even after that, [[religious freedom]] was denied in practice, if not in theory.\n\n=== Concordat of 1851 ===\nCatholicism became the state religion in 1851, when the Spanish government signed a [[Concordat]] with the [[Holy See]] that committed [[Madrid]] to pay the salaries of the clergy and to subsidize other expenses of the Roman Catholic Church as a compensation for the seizure of church property in the ''[[Desamortizaci\u00f3n de Mendiz\u00e1bal]]'' of 1835-1837. This pact was renounced in 1931, when the secular constitution of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] imposed a series of anticlerical measures that threatened the Church's hegemony in Spain, provoking the Church's support for the [[Francisco Franco]] uprising five years later.<ref name=\"LOCprof2\">Text used in this cited section originally came from: [http://rs6.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html Spain Country Study] from the [[Library of Congress Country Studies]] project.\n</ref> In the ensuing [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], alleged communists and anarchists in Republican areas killed about [[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|7,000 priests]], the majority murdered between July and December 1936.

During the Franco years, Roman Catholicism was the only religion to have legal status; other worship services could not be advertised, and no other religion could own property or publish books. The Government not only continued to pay priests' salaries and to subsidize the Church, it also assisted in the reconstruction of church buildings damaged by the war. Laws were passed abolishing divorce and civil marriages as well as banning abortion and the sale of contraceptives. Homosexuality and all other forms of sexual permissiveness were also banned.  Catholic religious instruction was mandatory, even in public schools. Franco secured in return the right to name Roman Catholic bishops in Spain, as well as veto power over appointments of clergy down to the parish priest level.\n\nIn 1953 this close cooperation was formalized in a [[Concordat of 1953|new Concordat]] with the Vatican that granted the church an extraordinary set of privileges: mandatory canonical marriages for all Catholics; exemption from government taxation; subsidies for new building construction; censorship of materials the Church deemed offensive; the right to establish universities, to operate radio stations, and to publish newspapers and magazines; protection from police intrusion into church properties; and exemption of military service.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nThe proclamation of the [[Second Vatican Council]] in favor of religious freedom in 1965 provided more rights to other religious denominations in Spain. In the late 1960s, the Vatican attempted to reform the Church in Spain by appointing interim, or acting, bishops, thereby circumventing Franco's stranglehold on the country's clergy. Many young priests, under foreign influence, became [[worker priest]]s and participated in anti-regime agitation. Many of them ended as leftist politicians, with some imprisoned in the [[Concordat prison]] reserved for priest prisoners. In 1966, the Franco regime passed a law that freed other religions from many of the earlier restrictions, but the law also reaffirmed the privileges of the Catholic Church. Any attempt to revise the 1953 Concordat met Franco's rigid resistance.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\n===Separation of church and state since 1978===\n[[Image:Vicente Enrique y Taranc\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|left|Cardinal [[Vicente Enrique y Taranc\u00f3n]] adopted a democratic stance and was decisive in separating church from state in Spain.<ref name=tarancon1>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2007/11/20/sociedad/1195513202_850215.html|title=El cardenal Taranc\u00f3n lo intent\u00f3 en 1971 |publisher= [[El Pa\u00eds]] |date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2018-04-08| quote=Sin Taranc\u00f3n y su grupo de colaboradores, apoyados en todo momento por el papa Pablo VI, la transici\u00f3n desde el nacionalcatolicismo hacia la democracia hubiera sido imposible. | language=Spanish}}</ref> As a result, he received continuous death threats from hardline Francoists, including far-right Catholics, until democracy was well established; \"\u00a1Taranc\u00f3n al pared\u00f3n!\" ''(Taranc\u00f3n to the execution wall!)'' was a common slogan.<ref name=tarancon2>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2012/01/22/domingo/1327207955_850215.html|title=La rabia de Taranc\u00f3n |publisher= [[El Pa\u00eds]] |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2018-04-08| language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name=tarancon3>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2007/09/13/sociedad/1189634413_850215.html|title=El cardenal que hizo llorar a Franco |publisher= [[El Pa\u00eds]] |date=2012-01-22 |accessdate=2018-04-08| language=Spanish}}</ref>]]\nIn 1976, however, King [[Juan Carlos de Borbon]] unilaterally renounced the right to name the bishops; later that year, Madrid and the Vatican signed a new accord that restored to the church its right to name bishops, and the Church agreed to a revised Concordat that entailed a gradual financial [[separation of church and state]]. Church property not used for religious purposes was henceforth to be subject to taxation, and over a period of years the Church's reliance on state subsidies was to be gradually reduced. The timetable for this reduction was not adhered to, however, and the church continued to receive the public subsidy through 1987 (US$110 million in that year alone).<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIt took the new [[1978 Spanish Constitution]] to confirm the right of Spaniards to religious freedom and to begin the process of disestablishing Catholicism as the state religion. The drafters of the Constitution tried to deal with the intense controversy surrounding state support of the Church, but they were not entirely successful. The initial draft of the Constitution did not even mention the Church, which was included almost as an afterthought and only after intense pressure from the church's leadership. Article 16 disestablishes Roman Catholicism as the official religion and provides that religious liberty for non-Catholics is a state-protected legal right, thereby replacing the policy of limited toleration of non-Catholic religious practices. The article further states, however, that: \"The public authorities shall take the religious beliefs of Spanish society into account and shall maintain the consequent relations of cooperation with the Catholic Church and the other confessions.\" In addition, Article 27 also aroused controversy by appearing to pledge continuing government subsidies for private, Church-affiliated schools. These schools were sharply criticized by Spanish Socialists for having created and perpetuated a class-based, separate, and unequal school system. The Constitution, however, includes no affirmation that the majority of Spaniards are Catholics or that the state should take into account the teachings of Catholicism.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" /> The Constitution declares Spain a \"non-confessional\" state, however it is not a ''[[la\u00efque]]'' (secular) state like [[Catholic Church in France|France]] or [[Catholic Church in Mexico|Mexico]].\n\nGovernment financial aid to the Catholic Church was a difficult and contentious issue. The Church argued that, in return for the subsidy, the state had received the social, health, and educational services of tens of thousands of priests and nuns who fulfilled vital functions that the state itself could not have performed at that time. Nevertheless, the revised Concordat was supposed to replace direct state aid to the church with a scheme that would allow taxpayers to designate a certain portion of their taxes to be diverted directly to the Church. Through 1985, taxpayers were allowed to deduct up to 10 percent from their taxable income for donations to the Catholic Church. Partly because of the protests against this arrangement from representatives of Spain's other religious groups and even from some Catholics, the tax laws were changed in 2007 so that taxpayers could choose between giving 0.52 percent of their income tax to the church and allocating it to the government's welfare and culture budgets. For three years, the government would continue to give the Church a gradually reduced subsidy, but after that the church would have to subsist on its own resources. The government would continue, however, its program of subsidizing Catholic schools, which in 1987 cost the Spanish taxpayers about US$300 million exclusive of the salaries of teachers, which were paid directly by the Ministry of Education and Science.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIn a population of about 39 million at the beginning of [[Spanish transition to democracy|Transition]] (begun in November 1975), the number of non-Catholics was probably no more than 300,000. About 290,000 of these were of other Christian faiths, including several Protestant denominations, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Spain|Mormons]]. The number of Jews in Spain was estimated at about 13,000 in the\n[[Murcia Jewish community]]. More than 19 out of every 20 Spaniards were baptized Catholics; about 60 percent of them attended Mass; about 30 percent of the baptized Catholics did so regularly, although this figure declined to about 20 percent in the larger cities. In 1979, about 97 percent of all marriages were performed according to the Catholic rite. A 1982 report by the church claimed that 82 percent of all children born the preceding year had been baptized in the church.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nNevertheless, there were forces at work bringing about fundamental changes in the place of the church in society. One such force was the improvement in the economic fortunes of the great majority of Spaniards, making society more [[materialistic]] and less religious. Another force was the massive shift in population from farm and village to the growing urban centers, where the church had less influence over the values of its members. These changes were transforming the way Spaniards defined their religious identity.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nBeing a Catholic in Spain had less and less to do with regular attendance at [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]] and more to do with the routine observance of important rituals such as baptism, marriage, and burial of the dead. A 1980 survey revealed that, although 82 percent of Spaniards were believers in Catholicism, very few considered themselves to be very good practitioners of the faith. In the case of the youth of the country, even smaller percentages believed themselves to be \"very good\" or \"practicing\" Catholics.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIn contrast to an earlier era, when rejection of the church went along with education, in the late 1980s studies showed that the more educated a person was, the more likely he or she was to be a practicing Catholic. This new acceptance of the church was due partly to the church's new self-restraint in politics. In a significant change from the pre-Civil War era, the church had accepted the need for the separation of religion and the state, and it had even discouraged the creation of a Christian Democratic party in the country.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n[[Image:Presidente de Espa\u00f1a Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero en el Senado en marzo de 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]], an openly agnostic<ref name=ZAPATERO>{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2008/06/29/domingo/1214711557_850215.html|title=\"'Miembras' abri\u00f3 el debate.

Although the Socialist leadership professed [[agnosticism]], according to surveys between 40 and 45 percent of the party's rank-and-file members held religious beliefs, and more than 70 percent of these professed to be Catholics. Among those entering the party after Franco's death, about half considered themselves Catholic.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nOne important indicator of the changes taking place in the role of the church was the reduction in the number of Spaniards in Holy Orders. In 1984 the country had more than 22,000 parish priests, nearly 10,000 ordained monks, and nearly 75,000 nuns. These numbers concealed a troubling reality, however. More than 70 percent of the diocesan clergy was between the ages of 35 and 65; the average age of the clergy in 1982 was 49 years. At the upper end of the age range, the low numbers reflected the impact of the Civil War, in which more than 4,000 parish priests died. At the lower end, the scarcity of younger priests reflected the general crisis in vocations throughout the world, which began to be felt in the 1960s. Its effects were felt very acutely in Spain. The crisis was seen in the decline in the number of young men joining the priesthood and in the increase in the number of priests leaving Holy Orders. The number of [[Seminary|seminarians]] in Spain fell from more than 9,000 in the 1950s to only 1,500 in 1979, even though it rose slightly in 1982 to about 1,700.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" /> In 2008, there were just 1,221 students in these theological schools.<ref name=SEMINARISTAS09>{{cite web|url=http://www.conferenciaepiscopal.es/seminarios/2009/Estadisticas.pdf|title=Estad\u00edsticas \"D\u00eda del Seminario\" 2009, Conferencia Episcopal Espa\u00f1ola|accessdate=2009-03-24|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530002400/http://www.conferenciaepiscopal.es/seminarios/2009/Estadisticas.pdf|archivedate=2009-05-30}}</ref>\n\nChanges in the social meaning of religious vocations were perhaps part of the problem; having a priest in the family no longer seemed to spark the kind of pride that family members would have felt in the past. The principal reason in most cases, though, was the church's continued ban on marriage for priests. Previously, the crisis was not particularly serious because of the age distribution of the clergy. As the twentieth century neared an end, however, a serious imbalance appeared between those entering the priesthood and those leaving it. The effects of this crisis were already visible in the decline in the number of parish priests in Spain\u2014from 23,620 in 1979 to just over 22,000 by 1983<ref name=\"LOCprof\" /> and 19,307 in 2005.<ref name=\"ESTADISTICA2005\" /> New ordinations also dropped 19% from 241 in 1998 to 196 in 2008, with all-time record lows of 168 priests out of 45 million Spaniards taking their vows in 2007.<ref name=\"SEMINARISTAS09\" /><ref name=ESTADISTICA2007>{{cite web|url=http://www.pastoral-vocacional.org/acontecimientos_vocacionales/estadis2007MA.html|title=Acontecimientos Vocacionales, estad\u00edstica de seminarios mayores 2007.

Opus Dei, a worldwide lay religious body, did not adhere to any particular political philosophy. Its founder, [[Jose Maria Escriva de Balaguer y Albas]], stated that the organization was nonpolitical. The organization was founded in 1928 as a reaction to the increasing secularization of Spain's universities, and higher education continued to be one of the institute's foremost priorities. Despite its public commitment to a nonpolitical stance, Opus Dei members rose to occupy key positions in the Franco r\u00e9gime, especially in the field of economic policy-making in the late 1950s and the early 1960s. Opus Dei members dominated the group of liberal technocrats who engineered the opening of Spain's [[Autarky|autarchic economy]] after 1957. After the 1973 assassination of Prime Minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] (often rumored to be an Opus Dei member), however, the influence of the institute declined sharply. The secrecy of the order and its activities and the power of its myth helped it maintain its strong position of influence in Spain; but there was little doubt that, compared with the 1950s and the 1960s, Opus Dei had fallen from being one of the country's chief political organizations to being simply one among many such groups competing for power in an open and pluralist society.<ref name=LOCprof>{{cite book |last1=Solsten |first1=Eric |last2=Meditz |first2=Sandra |date=1990 |title=Spain: A Country Study |url=https://www.loc.gov/resource/frdcstdy.spaincountrystud00sols_0/ |location= |publisher=United States [[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division |page=115 |isbn=9780160285509 |lccn=90006127}}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\n\nAn important number of Latin American immigrants, who are usually strong Catholic practitioners, have helped the Catholic Church to recover part of the attendance that regular Masses (Sunday Mass) used to have in the sixties and seventies and that was lost in the eighties among native Spaniards.\n\nSince 2003, the involvement of the Catholic Church in political affairs, through special groups such as [[Opus Dei]], the [[Neocatechumenal Way]] or the [[Legion of Christ]], especially personated through important politicians in the right-wing People's Party, has increased again. Old and new media, which are property of the Church, such as the [[Cadena COPE|COPE]] radio network or [[:es:Trece (canal de televisi\u00f3n)|13 TV]], have also contributed to this new involvement in politics by their own admission.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Un informe de la Iglesia califica a 13TV de \"culturalmente pobre\", af\u00edn al PP y para \"la tercera edad\"|url=http://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/encargado-denuncia-television-eminentemente-definida_0_518998732.html|accessdate=15 November 2017|publisher = eldiario.es|language=es}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://bluper.elespanol.com/noticias/iglesia-califica-13tv-afin-pp-culturalmente-pobre|title=La Iglesia califica a 13 TV como af\u00edn al PP y para \"la tercera edad\" {{!}} Bluper|accessdate=15 November 2017|publisher = bluper.elespanol.com|language=es}}</ref> The Church is no longer seen as a neutral and independent institution in political affairs and it is generally aligned with the opinion and politics of the People's Party.

He started playing at a local club, Bruunsh\u00e5b-Tapdrup IF, where he played some years before the trip went on to FK Viborg. Already at the age of 16, he went on a trial at [[AS Monaco]].<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/Fire-ugers-genoptraening-til-Viborgtalent/ Fire ugers genoptr\u00e6ning til Viborgtalent], bold.dk, 19 August 2008</ref> He was promoted to the first team squad in August 2008 at the age of 17.<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/Viborg-rykker-17-aarig-i-A-truppen/ Viborg rykker 17-\u00e5rig i A-truppen], bold.dk, 28 August 2008</ref>\n\nHis professional career accelerated when he became the fourth youngest player in 2007 to debut in the [[Danish Superliga]].

Andersen started out as a midfielder in his youth career, but was retrained as a defender.\n\nHe continued to develop and spent another three years at the club, after extending his contract with the club until 2011. Although he got a good portion of time on the pitch, it wasn\u2019t enough for him in the last, so he was loaned out to [[Randers FC]].<ref>[http://www.morethanaclub.dk/spiller/alexander-juel-andersen/ Alexander Juel Andersen], morethanaclub.dk</ref>\n\n====Loan to Randers FC====\nAndersen was loaned out to [[Randers FC]] in January 2011 until the summer 2011.<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/Randers-lejer-kommende-Horsens-spiller/ Randers lejer kommende Horsens-spiller], bold.dk, 1 February 2011</ref> In Randers, Andersen didn\u2019t play a single match due to a lot of injuries.

He started playing at a local club, Bruunsh\u00e5b-Tapdrup IF, where he played some years before the trip went on to FK Viborg. Already at the age of 16, he went on a trial at [[AS Monaco]].<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/Fire-ugers-genoptraening-til-Viborgtalent/ Fire ugers genoptr\u00e6ning til Viborgtalent], bold.dk, 19 August 2008</ref> He was promoted to the first team squad in August 2008 at the age of 17.<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/Viborg-rykker-17-aarig-i-A-truppen/ Viborg rykker 17-\u00e5rig i A-truppen], bold.dk, 28 August 2008</ref>\n\nHis professional career accelerated when he became the fourth youngest player in 2007 to debut in the [[Danish Superliga]]. This happened, when he came on the pitch in a [[Danish Superliga]] match between [[Viborg FF]] and [[Randers FC]] at the age of only 16 years.<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/Yngste-Superliga-debutant-nogensinde/ Yngste Superliga-debutant nogensinde], bold.dk, 6 April 2009</ref> He was nominated as the player of the year by the fans for the 2008/09 season. Andersen started out as a midfielder in his youth career, but was retrained as a defender.\n\nHe continued to develop and spent another three years at the club, after extending his contract with the club until 2011. Although he got a good portion of time on the pitch, it wasn\u2019t enough for him in the last, so he was loaned out to [[Randers FC]].<ref>[http://www.morethanaclub.dk/spiller/alexander-juel-andersen/ Alexander Juel Andersen], morethanaclub.dk</ref>\n\n====Loan to Randers FC====\nAndersen was loaned out to [[Randers FC]] in January 2011 until the summer 2011.<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/Randers-lejer-kommende-Horsens-spiller/ Randers lejer kommende Horsens-spiller], bold.dk, 1 February 2011</ref> In Randers, Andersen didn\u2019t play a single match due to a lot of injuries. He was operated for an injury in his groin in March 2011.<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/Lovende-Randers-forsvarer-skal-opereres/ Lovende Randers-forsvarer skal opereres], bold.dk, 10 March 2011</ref>\n\n===AC Horsens===\n[[AC Horsens]] signed Andersen already in January 2011, but the transfer would first be valid from the summer 2011, when his contract with [[Viborg FF]] expired.<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/AC-Horsens-napper-Viborg-profil/ AC Horsens napper Viborg-profil], bold.dk, 24 January 2011</ref> He was initially not bought into the starting lineup, but he quickly changed it and quickly became a regular part of [[Johnny M\u00f8lby]]'s squad.\n\nWhen AC Horsens was relegated to the [[Danish 1st Division]] back in 2013, many clubs were interested in the right back, but AGF pulled the longest straw when they presented the player to a 4-year contract with expiry in July 2017.\n\n===AGF===\nAndersen was official signed on 11 July 2013 by [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|AGF]] on a 4-year contract.<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/Officielt-Alexander-Juel-til-AGF/ Officielt: Alexander Juel til AGF], bold.dk,\n 11 July 2013</ref>\n\nIn AGF Alexander Juel Andersen was conceived as a role on the right back, but slowly he was retrained and was most used in the central defense, becoming one of the club's favorites under [[Peter S\u00f8rensen (footballer)|Peter S\u00f8rensen]], while referring more to the bench when [[Morten Wieghorst]] took over the coach seat.

Earlier Viking settlers had begun arriving in the 880s, but were divided between colonies in the east ([[Roumois]] and [[Pays de Caux]]) around the low Seine valley and in the west in the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], and were separated by traditional ''[[Pagus|pagii]]'', where the population remained about the same with almost no foreign settlers. Rollo's contingents from Scandinavia who raided and ultimately settled Normandy and parts of the European Atlantic coast included [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Norwegians]], [[Norse\u2013Gaels]], [[Orkney|Orkney Vikings]], possibly [[Swedes]], and Anglo-Danes from the English [[Danelaw]] territory which earlier came under Norse control in the early [[11th century]].\n\nThe descendants of Vikings replaced the [[Norse religion]] and [[Old Norse]] language with [[Catholicism]] ([[Christianity]]) and the [[Langues d'o\u00efl|Langue d'oil]] of the local people, descending from the [[Latin language|Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. The [[Norman language]] (Norman French ) was forged by the adoption of the indigenous ''[[Langues d'o\u00efl|langue d'o\u00efl]]'' branch of [[Romance languages|Romance]] by a Norse-speaking ruling class, and it developed into the [[Languages of France|French regional languages]] that survive today.<ref name=\"Norman\" />\n\nThe Normans thereafter adopted the growing [[feudalism|feudal]] doctrines of the rest of France, and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both [[Normandy]] and in [[Norman England|Norman dominated England]].<ref name=\"searle\"/> The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old [[French nobility|French aristocracy]], most of whom traced their lineage to the [[Franks]] of the [[Carolingian dynasty]] from the days of [[Charlemagne]] in the [[9th century]]. Most Norman knights remained poor and land-hungry, and by the time of the expedition and invasion of England in 1066, Normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation. Many Normans of [[Italy]], France and England eventually served as avid [[Crusades|Crusaders]] soldiers under the [[Italo-Norman]] prince [[Bohemund I of Antioch]] and the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] king [[Richard the Lion-Heart]], one of the more famous and illustrious Kings of England.\n\n==Conquests and military offensives==\n===Italy===\n{{See also|Norman conquest of southern Italy|Emirate of Sicily|Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Robert Guiscard|Italo-Norman}}\n[[File:Adrano normannisches Kastell.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The early Norman castle at [[Adrano]]]]\n\nOpportunistic bands of Normans successfully established a foothold in [[southern Italy]]. Probably as the result of returning pilgrims' stories, the Normans entered southern Italy as warriors in 1017 at the latest. In 999, according to [[Amatus of Montecassino]], Norman pilgrims returning from [[Jerusalem]] called in at the port of [[Salerno]] when a [[Saracen]] attack occurred. The Normans fought so valiantly that Prince [[Guaimar III of Salerno|Guaimar III]] begged them to stay, but they refused and instead offered to tell others back home of the Prince's request. [[William of Apulia]] tells that, in 1016, Norman pilgrims to the shrine of the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] at [[Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo|Monte Gargano]] were met by [[Melus of Bari]], a [[Lombards|Lombard]] nobleman and rebel, who persuaded them to return with more warriors to help throw off the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule, which they did.\n\nThe two most prominent Norman families to arrive in the [[Mediterranean]] were descendants of [[Tancred of Hauteville]] and the [[Drengot family]].\nA group of Normans with at least five brothers from the Drengot family fought the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in [[Apulia]] under the command of Melo di Bari. Between 1016 and 1024, in a fragmented political context, the County of [[Ariano Irpino|Ariano]] was founded by another group of Norman knights headed by [[Gilbert Buat\u00e8re]] and hired by Melo di Bari. Defeated at [[Canne]], Melo di Bari escaped to [[Bamberg]], [[Germany]], where he died in 1022. The County, which replaced the pre-existing chamberlainship, is considered to be the first political body established by the Normans in the South of Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cesn.it/mezzogiorno.htm|title=Il Mezzogiorno agli inizi dell'XI secolo|trans-title=The south of Italy at the beginning of 11th century|website=European Center for Norman Studies|language=Italian}}</ref>\nThen [[Rainulf Drengot]], from the same family, received the county of [[Aversa]] from Duke [[Sergius IV of Naples]] in 1030.\n\nThe [[Hauteville family]] achieved princely rank by proclaiming Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] \"Duke of [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]]\".

Under this state, there was great religious freedom, and alongside the Norman nobles existed a meritocratic bureaucracy of [[Jews]], [[Muslim]]s and Christians, both [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]]. The Kingdom of Sicily thus became characterized by Norman, Byzantine, Greek, Arab, Lombard and \"native\" Sicilian populations living in harmony, and its [[List of monarchs of Sicily#Kings of Sicily|Norman rulers]] fostered plans of establishing an empire that would have encompassed [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]] as well as the [[crusader states]] in the [[Levant]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |title=Roger II \u2014King of Sicily |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |accessdate=2010-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523045823/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |archivedate=23 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D61331F935A15757C0A961948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 |title=Tracing The Norman Rulers of Sicily |newspaper=New York Times |date=1987-04-26 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | first=Louis | last=Inturrisi}}</ref><ref>''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 17.</ref> One of the great geographical treatises of the [[Middle Ages]], the \"''[[Tabula Rogeriana]]''\", was written by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[al-Idrisi]] for King Roger II of Sicily, and entitled \"''Kitab Rudjdjar''\" (\"''The Book of Roger''\").<ref name=\"Lewis, p.148\">Lewis, p.148</ref>\n\n=== North Africa===\n{{See also|Kingdom of Africa}}\nBetween 1135 and 1160, the Norman kingdom of Sicily conquered and kept as vassals several cities on the [[Ifriqiya]] coast,  corresponding to Tunisia and parts of Algeria and Libya today.\nThey were lost to the Almohads.\n\n===Byzantium===\n{{See also|Byzantine-Norman wars|Varangian Guard|William Iron Arm}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2012}}\n{{context|section|date=December 2012}}\nSoon after the Normans began to enter Italy, they entered the [[Byzantine Empire]] and then [[Medieval Armenia|Armenia]], fighting against the [[Pechenegs]], the [[Bulgars]], and especially the [[Seljuk Turks]]. Norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the Lombards to act against the Byzantines, but they soon fought in Byzantine service in Sicily. They were prominent alongside [[Varangian]] and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of [[George Maniaces]] in 1038\u201340. There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy, and it now seems likely only a few came from there. It is also unknown how many of the \"Franks\", as the Byzantines called them, were Normans and not other Frenchmen.\n\n[[File:Normannen.png|upright=1.15|thumb|Norman expansion by 1130]]\n\nOne of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was [[Herv\u00e9 (Norman)|Herv\u00e9]] in the 1050s. By then, however, there were already Norman mercenaries serving as far away as [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. They were based at [[Malatya]] and [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], under the Byzantine duke of [[Antioch]], [[Isaac Komnenos, Duke of Antioch|Isaac Komnenos]]. In the 1060s, [[Robert Crispin]] led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks. [[Roussel de Bailleul]] even tried to carve out an independent state in [[Asia Minor]] with support from the local population, but he was stopped by the Byzantine general [[Alexius I Komnenos|Alexius Komnenos]].\n\nSome Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenian vassal-states of [[Sassoun]] and [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] in far eastern [[Anatolia]]. Later, many took up service with the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian state further south in Cilicia]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]]. A Norman named [[Roussel de Bailleul|Oursel]] led a force of \"Franks\" into the upper [[Euphrates]] valley in northern [[Syria]]. From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general [[Philaretus Brachamius]] were Normans\u2014formerly of Oursel\u2014led by [[Raimbaud]]. They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning \"Franks\". The known trade between [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]] and Antioch and between [[Bari]] and [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy.\n\nSeveral families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the [[Comnenian Restoration]], when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors. The Raoulii were descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul, the Petraliphae were descended from a Pierre d'Aulps, and that group of [[Albania]]n clans known as the Maniakates were descended from Normans who served under [[George Maniaces]] in the Sicilian expedition of 1038.\n\n[[Robert Guiscard]], another Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of [[Apulia]] as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern [[Italy]]. Having obtained the consent of [[Pope Gregory VII]] and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]] and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of [[Albania]], capturing [[Vlora|Valona]], [[Kanin\u00eb|Kanina]], Jericho ([[Orikumi]]), and reaching [[Butrint]] after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered [[Corfu]] and attacked [[Dyrrachium]] from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of Emperor [[Alexius I Comnenus]] to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The [[Albania]]n forces could not take part in the ensuing [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|battle]] because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the city of Dyrrachium to the [[Count of the Tent]] (or Byzantine provincial administrators) mobilizing from [[Arbanon]] (i.e., \u1f10\u03be \u1f08\u03c1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7; the term ''\u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7'' is short for \u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 meaning \"Count of the Tent\").<ref>[[Anna Comnena]]. ''The Alexiad'', 4.8; {{harvnb|Vranousi|1962|pp=5\u201326}}.</ref> The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and [[Amalfi]]tan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and [[Butrint]] in 1085, after the death of Robert.\n\nA few years after the [[First Crusade]], in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail. Meanwhile, they occupied [[Petrela]], the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river [[Devoll (river)|Deabolis]], Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho. This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, the Normans secured the [[Arbanon]] passes and opened their way to Dibra. The lack of supplies, disease and Byzantine resistance forced Bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines in the city of Deabolis.\n\nThe further decline of Byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185, when a large Norman army invaded [[Dyrrachium]], owing to the betrayal of high Byzantine officials. Some time later, Dyrrachium\u2014one of the most important naval bases of the [[Adriatic]]\u2014fell again to Byzantine hands.\n\n===England===\n<!--Tostig Godwinson links here-->\n{{See also|Norman conquest of England|William the Conqueror|Domesday Book|Anglo-Normans}}\n{{House of Normandy}}\nThe Normans were in contact with England from an early date. Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the [[English Channel]]. This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of [[Emma of Normandy|Emma]], sister of Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], and King [[Ethelred II of England]]. Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]]. His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after [[Cnut the Great]]'s conquest of the isle.\n\nWhen [[Edward the Confessor]] finally returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother [[Harthacnut]], he brought with him a Norman-educated mind. He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force. This concept never really took root, but it is a typical example of Edward's attitude. He appointed [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges]] [[archbishop of Canterbury]] and made [[Ralph the Timid]] [[earl of Hereford]]. He invited his brother-in-law [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne]] to his court in 1051, an event that resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl [[Godwin of Wessex]].\n\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene19 detail Castle Dinan.jpg|upright=1.15|left|thumb|Siege of a [[motte-and-bailey]] castle from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\n\nOn 14 October 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] gained a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Hastings]], which led to the conquest of England three years later;<ref>''The Normans'', [[Marjorie Chibnall]]</ref> this can be seen on the [[Bayeux tapestry]] (a linen, embroidered cloth). The invading Normans and their descendants replaced the [[Anglo-Saxons]] as the ruling class of England. The nobility of England were part of a single Norman culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel. Early Norman kings of England, as Dukes of Normandy, owed homage to the King of France for their land on the continent. They considered England to be their most important holding (it brought with it the title of King\u2014an important status symbol).\n\nEventually, the Normans merged with the natives, combining languages and traditions, so much so that [[Marjorie Chibnall]] says \"writers still referred to Normans and English; but the terms no longer meant the same as in the immediate aftermath of 1066.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Normans|last=Chibnall|first=Marjorie|authorlink = Marjorie Chibnall|publisher=Blackwell publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-1-4051-4965-5|location=Oxford|pages=62|quote=|via=}}</ref> In the course of the [[Hundred Years' War]], the Norman aristocracy often identified themselves as English. The [[Anglo-Norman language]] became distinct from the [[Latin language]], something that was the subject of some humour by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. The Anglo-Norman language was eventually absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon language of their subjects (see [[Old English]]) and influenced it, helping (along with the [[Norse language]] of the earlier [[Danelaw|Anglo-Norse]] settlers and the [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]] used by the church) in the development of [[Middle English]]. It in turn evolved into [[Modern English]].\n\n===Ireland===\n{{See also|Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman Ireland|Normans in Ireland}}\n[[File:Trim Castle 6.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Norman keep in [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], [[County Meath]]]]\nThe Normans had a profound effect on Irish culture and history after their invasion at [[Bannow Bay]] in 1169. Initially, the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity. Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became \"[[More Irish than the Irish themselves (slogan)|more Irish than the Irish themselves]]\". The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of [[Ireland]], later known as [[the Pale]], and also built many fine castles and settlements, including [[Trim Castle]] and [[Dublin Castle]]. Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their [[surnames]]. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County [[Wexford]], where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names, such as Furlong, predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell), derived from the French Norman name Morel. Names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) usually indicate Norman ancestry. Except for the native surname Fitzpatrick, a [[gallicisation]] of Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig/\u00d3 Maol Ph\u00e1draig. Hiberno-Norman surnames with the prefix - 'fitz' include [[FitzGerald dynasty|Fitzgerald]], FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, [[Fitzmaurice]]. Families bearing such surnames as [[Barry (name)|Barry (de Barra)]] and [[House of Burke|De B\u00farca (Burke)]] are also of Norman extraction.\n\n===Scotland===\n{{See also|Scotland in the High Middle Ages|Scoto-Norman}}\nOne of the claimants of the English throne opposing [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], [[Edgar Atheling]], eventually fled to Scotland. King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]] married Edgar's sister [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], and came into opposition to William who had already disputed Scotland's southern borders. William invaded Scotland in 1072, riding as far as [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]] where he met up with his fleet of ships. Malcolm submitted, paid homage to William and surrendered his son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan]] as a hostage, beginning a series of arguments as to whether the Scottish Crown owed allegiance to the King of England.\n\nNormans went into Scotland, building castles and founding noble families that would provide some future kings, such as [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]], as well as founding a considerable number of the [[Scottish clan]]s. King [[David I of Scotland]], whose elder brother [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] had married [[Sybilla of Normandy]], was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], part of the process some scholars call the \"[[Davidian Revolution]]\". Having spent time at the court of [[Henry I of England]] (married to David's sister [[Edith of Scotland|Maud of Scotland]]), and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother [[M\u00e1el Coluim mac Alaxandair]], David had to reward many with lands. The process was continued under David's successors, most intensely of all under [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]]. The Norman-derived [[feudal]] system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland. Scottish families of the names [[Bruce (surname)|Bruce]], [[Gray (surname)|Gray]], Ramsay, Fraser, Rose, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and [[Gordon (surname)|Gordon]] to name but a few, and including the later royal [[House of Stewart]], can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.\n\n===Wales===\n{{See also|Norman invasion of Wales|Cambro-Norman}}\n[[File:Mms chepstow castle from river wye.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Chepstow Castle]] in Wales, built by [[William fitzOsbern]] in 1067]]\nEven before the Norman Conquest of England, the Normans had come into contact with [[Wales]]. Edward the Confessor had set up the aforementioned Ralph as earl of Hereford and charged him with defending the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]] and warring with the Welsh. In these original ventures, the Normans failed to make any headway into Wales.\n\nSubsequent to the Conquest, however, the Marches came completely under the dominance of William's most trusted Norman barons, including [[Bernard de Neufmarch\u00e9]], [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Roger of Montgomery]] in [[Shropshire]] and [[Hugh, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh Lupus]] in [[Cheshire]]. These Normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of Wales was at some point subject to Norman interference. Norman words, such as ''baron'' (''barwn''), first entered [[Welsh language|Welsh]] at that time.\n\n===On crusade===\n{{See also|Principality of Antioch|Bohemund I of Antioch|Richard the Lion-Heart}}\nThe legendary religious zeal of the Normans was exercised in religious wars long before the [[First Crusade]] carved out a Norman [[Principality of Antioch|principality in Antioch]]. They were major foreign participants in the [[Reconquista]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. In 1018, [[Roger I of Tosny|Roger de Tosny]] travelled to the Iberian Peninsula to carve out a state for himself from [[Moorish]] lands, but failed. In 1064, during the [[War of Barbastro]], [[William of Montreuil]] led the papal army and took a huge booty.\n\nIn 1096, Crusaders passing by the siege of [[Amalfi]] were joined by [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] with an army of Italo-Normans. Bohemond was the ''de facto'' leader of the Crusade during its passage through [[Asia Minor]]. After the successful [[Siege of Antioch]] in 1097, Bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city. Tancred was instrumental in the conquest of [[Jerusalem]] and he worked for the expansion of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader kingdom]] in [[Oultrejordain|Transjordan]] and the region of [[Galilee]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Anglo-Norman conquest of Cyprus===\n{{See also|Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus in the Middle Ages}}[[File:Lusignan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Illuminated manuscript showing king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion-hearted]] authorizing [[Guy de Lusignan]] to take [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]]]]\nThe conquest of [[Cyprus]] by the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] forces of the [[Third Crusade]] opened a new chapter in the history of the island, which would be under [[Western Europe]]an domination for the following 380 years. Although not part of a planned operation, the conquest had much more permanent results than initially expected.\n\nIn April 1191, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion-hearted]] left [[Messina]] with a large fleet in order to reach [[Acre (city)|Acre]].{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 131}} But a storm dispersed the fleet. After some searching, it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fianc\u00e9e Berengaria was anchored on the south coast of Cyprus, together with the wrecks of several other ships, including the treasure ship.

Richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island, his troops being led by Guy de Lusignan. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains, because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. By 1 June, Richard had conquered the whole island. His exploit was well publicized and contributed to his reputation; he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}} Richard left for [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] on 5 June, with his allies.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}} Before his departure, he named two of his Norman generals, [[Richard de Camville]] and [[Robert of Thornham|Robert de Thornham]], as governors of Cyprus.\n\nWhile in Limassol, Richard the Lion-Heart married [[Berengaria of Navarre]], first-born daughter of King [[Sancho VI of Navarre]]. The wedding was held on 12 May 1191 at the Chapel of St. George and it was attended by Richard's sister [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]], whom he had brought from [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]]. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendor. Among other grand ceremonies was a double coronation: Richard caused himself to be crowned [[King of Cyprus]], and Berengaria Queen of England and [[List of Cypriot consorts|Queen of Cyprus]] as well.\n\n[[File:Le Canarien.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Norman expeditionary ship depicted in the chronicle ''[[Le Canarien]]'' (1490)]]\n\nThe rapid Anglo-Norman conquest proved more important than it seemed. The island occupied a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the Holy Land, whose occupation by the Christians could not continue without support from the sea.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 137}} Shortly after the conquest, Cyprus was sold to the [[Knights Templar]] and it was subsequently acquired, in 1192, by Guy de Lusignan and became a [[Kingdom of Cyprus|stable feudal kingdom]].{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 137}} It was only in 1489 that the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] acquired full control of the island, which remained a Christian stronghold until the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|fall of Famagusta]] in 1571.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}}\n\n===Canary Islands===\n{{see also|Conquest of the Canary Islands}}\nBetween 1402 and 1405, the expedition led by the Norman noble [[Jean de Bethencourt]]<ref name=\"EB1911Bethencourt\">{{EB1911|wstitle=B\u00e9thencourt, Jean de|volume=3}}</ref> and the [[Poitevine]] [[Gadifer de la Salle]] conquered the [[Canary Islands|Canarian islands]] of [[Lanzarote]], [[Fuerteventura]] and [[El Hierro]] off the Atlantic coast of Africa. Their troops were gathered in Normandy, Gascony and were later reinforced by [[Castilian people|Castilian]] colonists.\n\nBethencourt took the title of [[King of the Canary Islands]], as vassal to [[Henry III of Castile]]. In 1418, Jean's nephew [[Maciot de Bethencourt]] sold the rights to the islands to [[Enrique P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 2nd Count de Niebla]].\n\n==Culture==\n===Norman law===\n{{main|Norman law|Clameur de haro}}\nThe [[Custom (law)|customary law]] of [[Normandy]] was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of [[Law of Jersey|Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]] in the [[Channel Islands]]. Norman customary law was transcribed in two [[Coutume|customaries]] in [[Latin]] by two judges for use by them and their colleagues:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mondes-normands.caen.fr/angleterre/cultures/GB_FR/culture1_7.htm|title=Norman customary law|website=Mondes-normands.caen.fr|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref> These are the ''Tr\u00e8s ancien coutumier'' (''Very ancient customary''), authored between 1200 and 1245; and the ''Grand coutumier de Normandie'' (''Great customary of Normandy'', originally ''Summa de legibus Normanniae in curia la\u00efcali''), authored between 1235 and 1245.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Norman architecture}}\n[[File:Tower of London, Traitors Gate.jpg|thumb|A quintessential Norman keep: the [[Tower of London|White Tower]] in [[London]]]]\n\nNorman architecture typically stands out as a new stage in the architectural history of the regions they subdued. They spread a unique [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque idiom]] to England, Italy and Ireland, and the [[encastellation]] of these regions with [[keep]]s in their north French style fundamentally altered the military landscape. Their style was characterised by rounded [[arch]]es, particularly over windows and doorways, and massive proportions.\n\nIn England, the period of Norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo-Saxon]] and precedes the [[Gothic architecture|Early Gothic]]. In southern Italy, the Normans incorporated elements of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Lombardic architecture|Lombard]], and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] building techniques into their own, initiating a unique style known as [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture#Norman-Arab-Byzantine architecture|Norman-Arab architecture]] within the [[Kingdom of Sicily]].<ref name=\"Sicily\" />\n\n===Visual arts===\nIn the visual arts, the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered. However, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the [[Cluniac reform]] of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of [[scriptoria]] and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost [[illuminated manuscript]]s. The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy. The chief monasteries taking part in this \"renaissance\" of Norman art and scholarship were [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], [[F\u00e9camp]], [[Jumi\u00e8ges]], [[Bec-de-Mortagne|Bec]], [[Saint-Ouen, Rouen|Saint-Ouen]], [[Saint-Evroul]], and [[Saint-Wandrille]]. These centres were in contact with the so-called \"[[Winchester]] school\", which channeled a pure [[Carolingian art]]istic tradition to Normandy. In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century, Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts, but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.\n\n[[File:Lion, Norman Italy 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A bronze lion sculpture attributed to an [[Italo-Norman]] artist. Now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n\nThe [[French Wars of Religion]] in the 16th century and the [[French Revolution]] in the 18th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this Norman creativity. The former, with their violence, caused the wanton destruction of many Norman edifices; the latter, with its assault on religion, caused the purposeful destruction of religious objects of any type, and its destabilisation of society resulted in rampant pillaging.\n\nBy far the most famous work of Norman art is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], which is not a [[tapestry]] but a work of [[embroidery]]. It was commissioned by [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo]], the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] and first [[Earl of Kent]], employing natives from [[Kent]] who were learned in the Nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] [[Vikings]].\n\nIn Britain, Norman art primarily survives as [[stonework]] or [[metalwork]], such as [[capital (column)|capitals]] and [[baptismal font]]s. In southern Italy, however, Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek, Lombard, and Arab forebears. Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo, the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] inscriptions. Many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage. Lombard Salerno was a centre of [[ivory]]work in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination. The intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins. For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:David on harp.jpg|thumb|An illuminated manuscript from [[Saint-Evroul]] depicting [[King David]] on the lyre (or harp) in the middle of the back of the initial 'B']]\nNormandy was the site of several important developments in the history of [[classical music]] in the 11th century. [[F\u00e9camp Abbey]] and [[Saint-Evroul Abbey]] were centres of musical production and education. At F\u00e9camp, under two Italian abbots, [[William of Volpiano]] and John of Ravenna, the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught. It is still the most common form of pitch representation in English- and German-speaking countries today. Also at F\u00e9camp, the [[Staff (music)|staff]], around which [[neume]]s were oriented, was first developed and taught in the 11th century. Under the German abbot [[Isembard of La Trinit\u00e9-du-Mont|Isembard]], [[La Trinit\u00e9-du-Mont]] became a centre of musical composition.\n\nAt Saint Evroul, a tradition of singing had developed and the choir achieved fame in Normandy. Under the Norman abbot [[Robert de Grantmesnil]], several monks of Saint-Evroul fled to southern Italy, where they were patronised by Robert Guiscard and established a Latin monastery at [[Lamezia Terme#Sant'Eufemia Lamezia|Sant'Eufemia Lamezia]]. There they continued the tradition of singing.\n\n==Rulers==\n* [[Dukes of Normandy#Succession of the Dukes of Normandy|List of Dukes of Normandy]]\n* [[Count of Apulia|List of Counts and Dukes of Apulia and Calabria]]\n* [[List of Counts of Aversa]]\n* [[List of Princes of Capua]]\n* [[List of Hypati and Dukes of Gaeta|List of Dukes of Gaeta]]\n* [[Principality of Taranto#Hauteville (Altavilla) dynasty|List of Princes of Taranto]]\n* [[List of monarchs of Sicily]]\n* [[Principality of Antioch#Princes of Antioch, 1098\u20131268|List of Princes of Antioch]]\n* [[Officers of the Principality of Antioch|List of Officers of the Principality of Antioch]]\n* [[Lusignan dynasty#Second House of Lusignan|Second House of Lusignan]]\n* [[List of English monarchs#Normans|List of English Monarchs]]\n* [[List of Scottish monarchs]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture|France}}\n* [[House of Normandy]]\n* [[Norman language]]\n* [[Norsemen]]\n* [[Rus' people]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n===Primary===\n* {{Citation | editor-first = Elisabeth | editor-last = van Houts | title = The Normans in Europe | publisher = Manchester Medieval Sources | place = Manchester | year = 2000}}.\n* {{Citation | url = http://www.leeds.ac.uk/history/weblearning/MedievalHistoryTextCentre/medievalTexts.htm | title = Medieval History Texts in Translation | publisher = [[University of Leeds]]}}.\n\n===Secondary===\n* {{Citation | last = Bates | first = David | title = Normandy before 1066 | place = London | year = 1982}}\n* {{Citation | first = R.

The [[Norman language]] (Norman French ) was forged by the adoption of the indigenous ''[[Langues d'o\u00efl|langue d'o\u00efl]]'' branch of [[Romance languages|Romance]] by a Norse-speaking ruling class, and it developed into the [[Languages of France|French regional languages]] that survive today.<ref name=\"Norman\" />\n\nThe Normans thereafter adopted the growing [[feudalism|feudal]] doctrines of the rest of France, and worked them into a functional hierarchical system in both [[Normandy]] and in [[Norman England|Norman dominated England]].<ref name=\"searle\"/> The new Norman rulers were culturally and ethnically distinct from the old [[French nobility|French aristocracy]], most of whom traced their lineage to the [[Franks]] of the [[Carolingian dynasty]] from the days of [[Charlemagne]] in the [[9th century]]. Most Norman knights remained poor and land-hungry, and by the time of the expedition and invasion of England in 1066, Normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation. Many Normans of [[Italy]], France and England eventually served as avid [[Crusades|Crusaders]] soldiers under the [[Italo-Norman]] prince [[Bohemund I of Antioch]] and the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] king [[Richard the Lion-Heart]], one of the more famous and illustrious Kings of England.\n\n==Conquests and military offensives==\n===Italy===\n{{See also|Norman conquest of southern Italy|Emirate of Sicily|Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Robert Guiscard|Italo-Norman}}\n[[File:Adrano normannisches Kastell.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The early Norman castle at [[Adrano]]]]\n\nOpportunistic bands of Normans successfully established a foothold in [[southern Italy]]. Probably as the result of returning pilgrims' stories, the Normans entered southern Italy as warriors in 1017 at the latest. In 999, according to [[Amatus of Montecassino]], Norman pilgrims returning from [[Jerusalem]] called in at the port of [[Salerno]] when a [[Saracen]] attack occurred. The Normans fought so valiantly that Prince [[Guaimar III of Salerno|Guaimar III]] begged them to stay, but they refused and instead offered to tell others back home of the Prince's request. [[William of Apulia]] tells that, in 1016, Norman pilgrims to the shrine of the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] at [[Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo|Monte Gargano]] were met by [[Melus of Bari]], a [[Lombards|Lombard]] nobleman and rebel, who persuaded them to return with more warriors to help throw off the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule, which they did.\n\nThe two most prominent Norman families to arrive in the [[Mediterranean]] were descendants of [[Tancred of Hauteville]] and the [[Drengot family]].\nA group of Normans with at least five brothers from the Drengot family fought the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] in [[Apulia]] under the command of Melo di Bari. Between 1016 and 1024, in a fragmented political context, the County of [[Ariano Irpino|Ariano]] was founded by another group of Norman knights headed by [[Gilbert Buat\u00e8re]] and hired by Melo di Bari. Defeated at [[Canne]], Melo di Bari escaped to [[Bamberg]], [[Germany]], where he died in 1022. The County, which replaced the pre-existing chamberlainship, is considered to be the first political body established by the Normans in the South of Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cesn.it/mezzogiorno.htm|title=Il Mezzogiorno agli inizi dell'XI secolo|trans-title=The south of Italy at the beginning of 11th century|website=European Center for Norman Studies|language=Italian}}</ref>\nThen [[Rainulf Drengot]], from the same family, received the county of [[Aversa]] from Duke [[Sergius IV of Naples]] in 1030.\n\nThe [[Hauteville family]] achieved princely rank by proclaiming Prince [[Guaimar IV of Salerno]] \"Duke of [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]]\". He promptly awarded their elected leader, [[William Iron Arm]], with the title of count in his capital of [[Melfi]]. The Drengot family thereafter attained the [[principality of Capua]], and Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] legally ennobled the Hauteville leader, [[Drogo of Hauteville|Drogo]], as \"''dux et magister Italiae comesque Normannorum totius Apuliae et Calabriae''\" (\"''Duke and Master of Italy and Count of the Normans of all Apulia and Calabria''\") in 1047.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Normans|last=Brown, R.

Under this state, there was great religious freedom, and alongside the Norman nobles existed a meritocratic bureaucracy of [[Jews]], [[Muslim]]s and Christians, both [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]]. The Kingdom of Sicily thus became characterized by Norman, Byzantine, Greek, Arab, Lombard and \"native\" Sicilian populations living in harmony, and its [[List of monarchs of Sicily#Kings of Sicily|Norman rulers]] fostered plans of establishing an empire that would have encompassed [[Fatimid]] [[Egypt]] as well as the [[crusader states]] in the [[Levant]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |title=Roger II \u2014King of Sicily |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |accessdate=2010-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523045823/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9377080/Roger-II |archivedate=23 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D61331F935A15757C0A961948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 |title=Tracing The Norman Rulers of Sicily |newspaper=New York Times |date=1987-04-26 |accessdate=2010-01-21 | first=Louis | last=Inturrisi}}</ref><ref>''Les Normands en Sicile'', p. 17.</ref> One of the great geographical treatises of the [[Middle Ages]], the \"''[[Tabula Rogeriana]]''\", was written by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[al-Idrisi]] for King Roger II of Sicily, and entitled \"''Kitab Rudjdjar''\" (\"''The Book of Roger''\").<ref name=\"Lewis, p.148\">Lewis, p.148</ref>\n\n=== North Africa===\n{{See also|Kingdom of Africa}}\nBetween 1135 and 1160, the Norman kingdom of Sicily conquered and kept as vassals several cities on the [[Ifriqiya]] coast,  corresponding to Tunisia and parts of Algeria and Libya today.\nThey were lost to the Almohads.\n\n===Byzantium===\n{{See also|Byzantine-Norman wars|Varangian Guard|William Iron Arm}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2012}}\n{{context|section|date=December 2012}}\nSoon after the Normans began to enter Italy, they entered the [[Byzantine Empire]] and then [[Medieval Armenia|Armenia]], fighting against the [[Pechenegs]], the [[Bulgars]], and especially the [[Seljuk Turks]]. Norman mercenaries were first encouraged to come to the south by the Lombards to act against the Byzantines, but they soon fought in Byzantine service in Sicily. They were prominent alongside [[Varangian]] and Lombard contingents in the Sicilian campaign of [[George Maniaces]] in 1038\u201340. There is debate whether the Normans in Greek service actually were from Norman Italy, and it now seems likely only a few came from there. It is also unknown how many of the \"Franks\", as the Byzantines called them, were Normans and not other Frenchmen.\n\n[[File:Normannen.png|upright=1.15|thumb|Norman expansion by 1130]]\n\nOne of the first Norman mercenaries to serve as a Byzantine general was [[Herv\u00e9 (Norman)|Herv\u00e9]] in the 1050s. By then, however, there were already Norman mercenaries serving as far away as [[Trabzon|Trebizond]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. They were based at [[Malatya]] and [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], under the Byzantine duke of [[Antioch]], [[Isaac Komnenos, Duke of Antioch|Isaac Komnenos]]. In the 1060s, [[Robert Crispin]] led the Normans of Edessa against the Turks. [[Roussel de Bailleul]] even tried to carve out an independent state in [[Asia Minor]] with support from the local population, but he was stopped by the Byzantine general [[Alexius I Komnenos|Alexius Komnenos]].\n\nSome Normans joined Turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the Armenian vassal-states of [[Sassoun]] and [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] in far eastern [[Anatolia]]. Later, many took up service with the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian state further south in Cilicia]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]]. A Norman named [[Roussel de Bailleul|Oursel]] led a force of \"Franks\" into the upper [[Euphrates]] valley in northern [[Syria]]. From 1073 to 1074, 8,000 of the 20,000 troops of the Armenian general [[Philaretus Brachamius]] were Normans\u2014formerly of Oursel\u2014led by [[Raimbaud]]. They even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle: Afranji, meaning \"Franks\". The known trade between [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]] and Antioch and between [[Bari]] and [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] may be related to the presence of Italo-Normans in those cities while Amalfi and Bari were under Norman rule in Italy.\n\nSeveral families of Byzantine Greece were of Norman mercenary origin during the period of the [[Comnenian Restoration]], when Byzantine emperors were seeking out western European warriors. The Raoulii were descended from an Italo-Norman named Raoul, the Petraliphae were descended from a Pierre d'Aulps, and that group of [[Albania]]n clans known as the Maniakates were descended from Normans who served under [[George Maniaces]] in the Sicilian expedition of 1038.\n\n[[Robert Guiscard]], another Norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of [[Apulia]] as the result of his military successes, ultimately drove the Byzantines out of southern [[Italy]]. Having obtained the consent of [[Pope Gregory VII]] and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]] and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of [[Albania]], capturing [[Vlora|Valona]], [[Kanin\u00eb|Kanina]], Jericho ([[Orikumi]]), and reaching [[Butrint]] after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered [[Corfu]] and attacked [[Dyrrachium]] from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of Emperor [[Alexius I Comnenus]] to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The [[Albania]]n forces could not take part in the ensuing [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|battle]] because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the city of Dyrrachium to the [[Count of the Tent]] (or Byzantine provincial administrators) mobilizing from [[Arbanon]] (i.e., \u1f10\u03be \u1f08\u03c1\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f41\u03c1\u03bc\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9 \u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7; the term ''\u039a\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7'' is short for \u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 meaning \"Count of the Tent\").<ref>[[Anna Comnena]]. ''The Alexiad'', 4.8; {{harvnb|Vranousi|1962|pp=5\u201326}}.</ref> The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and [[Amalfi]]tan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and [[Butrint]] in 1085, after the death of Robert.\n\nA few years after the [[First Crusade]], in 1107, the Normans under the command of Bohemond, Robert's son, landed in Valona and besieged Dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time, but to no avail. Meanwhile, they occupied [[Petrela]], the citadel of Mili at the banks of the river [[Devoll (river)|Deabolis]], Gllavenica (Ballsh), Kanina and Jericho. This time, the Albanians sided with the Normans, dissatisfied by the heavy taxes the Byzantines had imposed upon them. With their help, the Normans secured the [[Arbanon]] passes and opened their way to Dibra. The lack of supplies, disease and Byzantine resistance forced Bohemond to retreat from his campaign and sign a peace treaty with the Byzantines in the city of Deabolis.\n\nThe further decline of Byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185, when a large Norman army invaded [[Dyrrachium]], owing to the betrayal of high Byzantine officials. Some time later, Dyrrachium\u2014one of the most important naval bases of the [[Adriatic]]\u2014fell again to Byzantine hands.\n\n===England===\n<!--Tostig Godwinson links here-->\n{{See also|Norman conquest of England|William the Conqueror|Domesday Book|Anglo-Normans}}\n{{House of Normandy}}\nThe Normans were in contact with England from an early date. Not only were their original Viking brethren still ravaging the English coasts, they occupied most of the important ports opposite England across the [[English Channel]]. This relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of [[Emma of Normandy|Emma]], sister of Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], and King [[Ethelred II of England]]. Because of this, Ethelred fled to Normandy in 1013, when he was forced from his kingdom by [[Sweyn Forkbeard]]. His stay in Normandy (until 1016) influenced him and his sons by Emma, who stayed in Normandy after [[Cnut the Great]]'s conquest of the isle.\n\nWhen [[Edward the Confessor]] finally returned from his father's refuge in 1041, at the invitation of his half-brother [[Harthacnut]], he brought with him a Norman-educated mind. He also brought many Norman counsellors and fighters, some of whom established an English cavalry force. This concept never really took root, but it is a typical example of Edward's attitude. He appointed [[Robert of Jumi\u00e8ges]] [[archbishop of Canterbury]] and made [[Ralph the Timid]] [[earl of Hereford]]. He invited his brother-in-law [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne]] to his court in 1051, an event that resulted in the greatest of early conflicts between Saxon and Norman and ultimately resulted in the exile of Earl [[Godwin of Wessex]].\n\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene19 detail Castle Dinan.jpg|upright=1.15|left|thumb|Siege of a [[motte-and-bailey]] castle from the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]]]\n\nOn 14 October 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] gained a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Hastings]], which led to the conquest of England three years later;<ref>''The Normans'', [[Marjorie Chibnall]]</ref> this can be seen on the [[Bayeux tapestry]] (a linen, embroidered cloth). The invading Normans and their descendants replaced the [[Anglo-Saxons]] as the ruling class of England. The nobility of England were part of a single Norman culture and many had lands on both sides of the channel. Early Norman kings of England, as Dukes of Normandy, owed homage to the King of France for their land on the continent. They considered England to be their most important holding (it brought with it the title of King\u2014an important status symbol).\n\nEventually, the Normans merged with the natives, combining languages and traditions, so much so that [[Marjorie Chibnall]] says \"writers still referred to Normans and English; but the terms no longer meant the same as in the immediate aftermath of 1066.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Normans|last=Chibnall|first=Marjorie|authorlink = Marjorie Chibnall|publisher=Blackwell publishing|year=2000|isbn=978-1-4051-4965-5|location=Oxford|pages=62|quote=|via=}}</ref> In the course of the [[Hundred Years' War]], the Norman aristocracy often identified themselves as English. The [[Anglo-Norman language]] became distinct from the [[Latin language]], something that was the subject of some humour by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]. The Anglo-Norman language was eventually absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon language of their subjects (see [[Old English]]) and influenced it, helping (along with the [[Norse language]] of the earlier [[Danelaw|Anglo-Norse]] settlers and the [[Ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]] used by the church) in the development of [[Middle English]]. It in turn evolved into [[Modern English]].\n\n===Ireland===\n{{See also|Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman Ireland|Normans in Ireland}}\n[[File:Trim Castle 6.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Norman keep in [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], [[County Meath]]]]\nThe Normans had a profound effect on Irish culture and history after their invasion at [[Bannow Bay]] in 1169. Initially, the Normans maintained a distinct culture and ethnicity. Yet, with time, they came to be subsumed into Irish culture to the point that it has been said that they became \"[[More Irish than the Irish themselves (slogan)|more Irish than the Irish themselves]]\". The Normans settled mostly in an area in the east of [[Ireland]], later known as [[the Pale]], and also built many fine castles and settlements, including [[Trim Castle]] and [[Dublin Castle]]. Both cultures intermixed, borrowing from each other's language, culture and outlook. Norman descendants today can be recognised by their [[surnames]]. Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County [[Wexford]], where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names, such as Furlong, predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell), derived from the French Norman name Morel. Names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) usually indicate Norman ancestry. Except for the native surname Fitzpatrick, a [[Gallicisation|gallicisation]] of Mac Giolla Ph\u00e1draig/\u00d3 Maol Ph\u00e1draig. Hiberno-Norman surnames with the prefix - 'fitz' include [[FitzGerald dynasty|Fitzgerald]], FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, [[Fitzmaurice]]. Families bearing such surnames as [[Barry (name)|Barry (de Barra)]] and [[House of Burke|De B\u00farca (Burke)]] are also of Norman extraction.\n\n===Scotland===\n{{See also|Scotland in the High Middle Ages|Scoto-Norman}}\nOne of the claimants of the English throne opposing [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], [[Edgar Atheling]], eventually fled to Scotland. King [[Malcolm III of Scotland]] married Edgar's sister [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]], and came into opposition to William who had already disputed Scotland's southern borders. William invaded Scotland in 1072, riding as far as [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross|Abernethy]] where he met up with his fleet of ships. Malcolm submitted, paid homage to William and surrendered his son [[Duncan II of Scotland|Duncan]] as a hostage, beginning a series of arguments as to whether the Scottish Crown owed allegiance to the King of England.\n\nNormans went into Scotland, building castles and founding noble families that would provide some future kings, such as [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert the Bruce]], as well as founding a considerable number of the [[Scottish clan]]s. King [[David I of Scotland]], whose elder brother [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander I]] had married [[Sybilla of Normandy]], was instrumental in introducing Normans and Norman culture to [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], part of the process some scholars call the \"[[Davidian Revolution]]\". Having spent time at the court of [[Henry I of England]] (married to David's sister [[Edith of Scotland|Maud of Scotland]]), and needing them to wrestle the kingdom from his half-brother [[M\u00e1el Coluim mac Alaxandair]], David had to reward many with lands. The process was continued under David's successors, most intensely of all under [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]]. The Norman-derived [[feudal]] system was applied in varying degrees to most of Scotland. Scottish families of the names [[Bruce (surname)|Bruce]], [[Gray (surname)|Gray]], Ramsay, Fraser, Rose, Ogilvie, Montgomery, Sinclair, Pollock, Burnard, Douglas and [[Gordon (surname)|Gordon]] to name but a few, and including the later royal [[House of Stewart]], can all be traced back to Norman ancestry.\n\n===Wales===\n{{See also|Norman invasion of Wales|Cambro-Norman}}\n[[File:Mms chepstow castle from river wye.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Chepstow Castle]] in Wales, built by [[William fitzOsbern]] in 1067]]\nEven before the Norman Conquest of England, the Normans had come into contact with [[Wales]]. Edward the Confessor had set up the aforementioned Ralph as earl of Hereford and charged him with defending the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]] and warring with the Welsh. In these original ventures, the Normans failed to make any headway into Wales.\n\nSubsequent to the Conquest, however, the Marches came completely under the dominance of William's most trusted Norman barons, including [[Bernard de Neufmarch\u00e9]], [[Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Roger of Montgomery]] in [[Shropshire]] and [[Hugh, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh Lupus]] in [[Cheshire]]. These Normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of Wales was at some point subject to Norman interference. Norman words, such as ''baron'' (''barwn''), first entered [[Welsh language|Welsh]] at that time.\n\n===On crusade===\n{{See also|Principality of Antioch|Bohemund I of Antioch|Richard the Lion-Heart}}\nThe legendary religious zeal of the Normans was exercised in religious wars long before the [[First Crusade]] carved out a Norman [[Principality of Antioch|principality in Antioch]]. They were major foreign participants in the [[Reconquista]] in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. In 1018, [[Roger I of Tosny|Roger de Tosny]] travelled to the Iberian Peninsula to carve out a state for himself from [[Moorish]] lands, but failed. In 1064, during the [[War of Barbastro]], [[William of Montreuil]] led the papal army and took a huge booty.\n\nIn 1096, Crusaders passing by the siege of [[Amalfi]] were joined by [[Bohemund I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]] with an army of Italo-Normans. Bohemond was the ''de facto'' leader of the Crusade during its passage through [[Asia Minor]]. After the successful [[Siege of Antioch]] in 1097, Bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city. Tancred was instrumental in the conquest of [[Jerusalem]] and he worked for the expansion of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader kingdom]] in [[Oultrejordain|Transjordan]] and the region of [[Galilee]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n===Anglo-Norman conquest of Cyprus===\n{{See also|Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus in the Middle Ages}}[[File:Lusignan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Illuminated manuscript showing king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lion-hearted]] authorizing [[Guy de Lusignan]] to take [[Kingdom of Cyprus|Cyprus]]]]\nThe conquest of [[Cyprus]] by the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] forces of the [[Third Crusade]] opened a new chapter in the history of the island, which would be under [[Western Europe]]an domination for the following 380 years.

Richard then proceeded to conquer the whole island, his troops being led by Guy de Lusignan. Isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains, because Richard had promised that he would not place him in irons. By 1 June, Richard had conquered the whole island. His exploit was well publicized and contributed to his reputation; he also derived significant financial gains from the conquest of the island.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}} Richard left for [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] on 5 June, with his allies.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}} Before his departure, he named two of his Norman generals, [[Richard de Camville]] and [[Robert of Thornham|Robert de Thornham]], as governors of Cyprus.\n\nWhile in Limassol, Richard the Lion-Heart married [[Berengaria of Navarre]], first-born daughter of King [[Sancho VI of Navarre]]. The wedding was held on 12 May 1191 at the Chapel of St. George and it was attended by Richard's sister [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]], whom he had brought from [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]]. The marriage was celebrated with great pomp and splendor. Among other grand ceremonies was a double coronation: Richard caused himself to be crowned [[King of Cyprus]], and Berengaria Queen of England and [[List of Cypriot consorts|Queen of Cyprus]] as well.\n\n[[File:Le Canarien.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Norman expeditionary ship depicted in the chronicle ''[[Le Canarien]]'' (1490)]]\n\nThe rapid Anglo-Norman conquest proved more important than it seemed. The island occupied a key strategic position on the maritime lanes to the Holy Land, whose occupation by the Christians could not continue without support from the sea.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 137}} Shortly after the conquest, Cyprus was sold to the [[Knights Templar]] and it was subsequently acquired, in 1192, by Guy de Lusignan and became a [[Kingdom of Cyprus|stable feudal kingdom]].{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 137}} It was only in 1489 that the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] acquired full control of the island, which remained a Christian stronghold until the [[Ottoman\u2013Venetian War (1570\u20131573)|fall of Famagusta]] in 1571.{{Sfn | Flori | 1999 | p = 138}}\n\n===Canary Islands===\n{{see also|Conquest of the Canary Islands}}\nBetween 1402 and 1405, the expedition led by the Norman noble [[Jean de Bethencourt]]<ref name=\"EB1911Bethencourt\">{{EB1911|wstitle=B\u00e9thencourt, Jean de|volume=3}}</ref> and the [[Poitevine]] [[Gadifer de la Salle]] conquered the [[Canary Islands|Canarian islands]] of [[Lanzarote]], [[Fuerteventura]] and [[El Hierro]] off the Atlantic coast of Africa. Their troops were gathered in Normandy, Gascony and were later reinforced by [[Castilian people|Castilian]] colonists.\n\nBethencourt took the title of [[King of the Canary Islands]], as vassal to [[Henry III of Castile]]. In 1418, Jean's nephew [[Maciot de Bethencourt]] sold the rights to the islands to [[Enrique P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 2nd Count de Niebla]].\n\n==Culture==\n===Norman law===\n{{main|Norman law|Clameur de haro}}\nThe [[Custom (law)|customary law]] of [[Normandy]] was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of [[Law of Jersey|Jersey]] and [[Guernsey]] in the [[Channel Islands]]. Norman customary law was transcribed in two [[Coutume|customaries]] in [[Latin]] by two judges for use by them and their colleagues:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mondes-normands.caen.fr/angleterre/cultures/GB_FR/culture1_7.htm|title=Norman customary law|website=Mondes-normands.caen.fr|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref> These are the ''Tr\u00e8s ancien coutumier'' (''Very ancient customary''), authored between 1200 and 1245; and the ''Grand coutumier de Normandie'' (''Great customary of Normandy'', originally ''Summa de legibus Normanniae in curia la\u00efcali''), authored between 1235 and 1245.\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Norman architecture}}\n[[File:Tower of London, Traitors Gate.jpg|thumb|A quintessential Norman keep: the [[Tower of London|White Tower]] in [[London]]]]\n\nNorman architecture typically stands out as a new stage in the architectural history of the regions they subdued. They spread a unique [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque idiom]] to England, Italy and Ireland, and the [[encastellation]] of these regions with [[keep]]s in their north French style fundamentally altered the military landscape. Their style was characterised by rounded [[arch]]es, particularly over windows and doorways, and massive proportions.\n\nIn England, the period of Norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the [[Anglo-Saxon architecture|Anglo-Saxon]] and precedes the [[Gothic architecture|Early Gothic]]. In southern Italy, the Normans incorporated elements of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Lombardic architecture|Lombard]], and [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] building techniques into their own, initiating a unique style known as [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture#Norman-Arab-Byzantine architecture|Norman-Arab architecture]] within the [[Kingdom of Sicily]].<ref name=\"Sicily\" />\n\n===Visual arts===\nIn the visual arts, the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered. However, in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform, encouraging the [[Cluniac reform]] of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits, especially the proliferation of [[scriptoria]] and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost [[illuminated manuscript]]s. The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy. The chief monasteries taking part in this \"renaissance\" of Norman art and scholarship were [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], [[F\u00e9camp]], [[Jumi\u00e8ges]], [[Bec-de-Mortagne|Bec]], [[Saint-Ouen, Rouen|Saint-Ouen]], [[Saint-Evroul]], and [[Saint-Wandrille]]. These centres were in contact with the so-called \"[[Winchester]] school\", which channeled a pure [[Carolingian art]]istic tradition to Normandy. In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century, Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts, but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.\n\n[[File:Lion, Norman Italy 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A bronze lion sculpture attributed to an [[Italo-Norman]] artist. Now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\n\nThe [[French Wars of Religion]] in the 16th century and the [[French Revolution]] in the 18th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this Norman creativity. The former, with their violence, caused the wanton destruction of many Norman edifices; the latter, with its assault on religion, caused the purposeful destruction of religious objects of any type, and its destabilisation of society resulted in rampant pillaging.\n\nBy far the most famous work of Norman art is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], which is not a [[tapestry]] but a work of [[embroidery]]. It was commissioned by [[Odo of Bayeux|Odo]], the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] and first [[Earl of Kent]], employing natives from [[Kent]] who were learned in the Nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] [[Vikings]].\n\nIn Britain, Norman art primarily survives as [[stonework]] or [[metalwork]], such as [[capital (column)|capitals]] and [[baptismal font]]s. In southern Italy, however, Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek, Lombard, and Arab forebears. Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo, the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with [[Arabic language|Arabic]] inscriptions. Many churches preserve sculptured fonts, capitals, and more importantly mosaics, which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage. Lombard Salerno was a centre of [[ivory]]work in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination. The intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins. For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:David on harp.jpg|thumb|An illuminated manuscript from [[Saint-Evroul]] depicting [[King David]] on the lyre (or harp) in the middle of the back of the initial 'B']]\nNormandy was the site of several important developments in the history of [[classical music]] in the 11th century. [[F\u00e9camp Abbey]] and [[Saint-Evroul Abbey]] were centres of musical production and education. At F\u00e9camp, under two Italian abbots, [[William of Volpiano]] and John of Ravenna, the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught. It is still the most common form of pitch representation in English- and German-speaking countries today. Also at F\u00e9camp, the [[Staff (music)|staff]], around which [[neume]]s were oriented, was first developed and taught in the 11th century. Under the German abbot [[Isembard of La Trinit\u00e9-du-Mont|Isembard]], [[La Trinit\u00e9-du-Mont]] became a centre of musical composition.\n\nAt Saint Evroul, a tradition of singing had developed and the choir achieved fame in Normandy. Under the Norman abbot [[Robert de Grantmesnil]], several monks of Saint-Evroul fled to southern Italy, where they were patronised by Robert Guiscard and established a Latin monastery at [[Lamezia Terme#Sant'Eufemia Lamezia|Sant'Eufemia Lamezia]]. There they continued the tradition of singing.\n\n==Rulers==\n* [[Dukes of Normandy#Succession of the Dukes of Normandy|List of Dukes of Normandy]]\n* [[Count of Apulia|List of Counts and Dukes of Apulia and Calabria]]\n* [[List of Counts of Aversa]]\n* [[List of Princes of Capua]]\n* [[List of Hypati and Dukes of Gaeta|List of Dukes of Gaeta]]\n* [[Principality of Taranto#Hauteville (Altavilla) dynasty|List of Princes of Taranto]]\n* [[List of monarchs of Sicily]]\n* [[Principality of Antioch#Princes of Antioch, 1098\u20131268|List of Princes of Antioch]]\n* [[Officers of the Principality of Antioch|List of Officers of the Principality of Antioch]]\n* [[Lusignan dynasty#Second House of Lusignan|Second House of Lusignan]]\n* [[List of English monarchs#Normans|List of English Monarchs]]\n* [[List of Scottish monarchs]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture|France}}\n* [[House of Normandy]]\n* [[Norman language]]\n* [[Norsemen]]\n* [[Rus' people]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n===Primary===\n* {{Citation | editor-first = Elisabeth | editor-last = van Houts | title = The Normans in Europe | publisher = Manchester Medieval Sources | place = Manchester | year = 2000}}.\n* {{Citation | url = http://www.leeds.ac.uk/history/weblearning/MedievalHistoryTextCentre/medievalTexts.htm | title = Medieval History Texts in Translation | publisher = [[University of Leeds]]}}.\n\n===Secondary===\n* {{Citation | last = Bates | first = David | title = Normandy before 1066 | place = London | year = 1982}}\n* {{Citation | first = R.
