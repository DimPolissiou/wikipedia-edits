{"title_page": "Selenium", "text_new": "{{about|the chemical element|the software testing framework|Selenium (software)}}\n{{short description|Chemical element with atomic number 34}}\n{{Infobox selenium}}\n'''Selenium''' is a [[chemical element]] with the [[Symbol (chemistry)|symbol]] '''Se''' and [[atomic number]]&nbsp;34. It is a [[nonmetal]] (more rarely considered a [[metalloid]]) with properties that are intermediate between the elements above and below in the [[periodic table]], [[sulfur]] and [[tellurium]], and also has similarities to [[arsenic]]. It rarely occurs in its elemental state or as pure ore compounds in the Earth's crust. Selenium \u2013 from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|el |\u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7}} (sel\u1e17n\u0113) \"Moon\" \u2013 was discovered in 1817 by [[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]], who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously discovered [[tellurium]] (named for the Earth).\n\nSelenium is found in [[:Category:Sulfide minerals|metal sulfide ores]], where it partially replaces the sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are [[glassmaking]] and [[pigment]]s. Selenium is a [[semiconductor]] and is used in [[photocell]]s. Applications in [[electronics]], once important, have been mostly replaced with [[silicon]] semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power [[surge protector]]s and one type of [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[quantum dot]].\n\nSelenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are necessary for cellular function in many organisms, including all animals. Selenium is an ingredient in many multivitamins and other dietary supplements, including [[infant formula]]. It is a component of the antioxidant enzymes [[glutathione peroxidase]] and [[thioredoxin reductase]] (which indirectly reduce certain [[Redox|oxidized]] molecules in animals and some plants). It is also found in three [[deiodinase]] enzymes, which convert one [[thyroid hormone]] to another. Selenium requirements in plants differ by species, with some plants requiring relatively large amounts and others apparently requiring none.<ref name=\"Ruyle\">{{cite web |url= http://cals.arizona.edu/arec/pubs/rmg/1%20rangelandmanagement/2%20poisonousplants93.pdf |title=Poisonous Plants on Arizona Rangelands |first=George |last=Ruyle |accessdate=2009-01-05 |publisher=The University of Arizona |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040715194026/http://cals.arizona.edu/AREC/pubs/rmg/1%20rangelandmanagement/2%20poisonousplants93.pdf |archivedate=2004-07-15 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Physical properties===\n[[File:Selenium trigonal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Structure of hexagonal (gray) selenium]]\nSelenium forms several [[allotrope]]s that interconvert with temperature changes, depending somewhat on the rate of temperature change. When prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is usually an [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]], brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, usually sold commercially as beads.<ref name=\"house2008\">{{cite book |title=Inorganic chemistry |first=James E. |last=House |publisher=Academic Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-12-356786-4 |page=524}}</ref> The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000&nbsp;atoms per ring. Black Se is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in [[carbon disulfide|CS<sub>2</sub>]]. Upon heating, it softens at 50&nbsp;\u00b0C and converts to gray selenium at 180&nbsp;\u00b0C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of [[halogen]]s and [[amine]]s.<ref name=ge>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw |pages=751\u2013752}}</ref>\n\nThe red \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 forms are produced from solutions of black selenium by varying the evaporation rate of the solvent (usually CS<sub>2</sub>). They all have relatively low, [[monoclinic]] crystal symmetries and contain nearly identical puckered Se<sub>8</sub> rings with different arrangements, as in [[sulfur]]. The packing is most dense in the \u03b1 form. In the Se<sub>8</sub> rings, the Se-Se distance is 233.5 pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 105.7\u00b0&nbsp;. Other selenium allotropes may contain Se<sub>6</sub> or Se<sub>7</sub> rings.<ref name=ge/>\n\nThe most stable and dense form of selenium is gray and has a hexagonal crystal lattice consisting of helical polymeric chains, where the Se-Se distance is 237.3&nbsp;pm and Se-Se-Se angle is 130.1\u00b0&nbsp;. The minimum distance between chains is 343.6&nbsp;pm. Gray Se is formed by mild heating of other allotropes, by slow cooling of molten Se, or by condensing Se vapor just below the melting point. Whereas other Se forms are insulators, gray Se is a semiconductor showing appreciable [[photoconductivity]]. Unlike the other allotropes, it is insoluble in CS<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=ge/> It resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by nonoxidizing [[acid]]s. With strong reducing agents, it forms polyselenides. Selenium does not exhibit the changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated.<ref name=\"house2008\"/><ref>{{YouTube|nDEfR2Nw50s|Video of selenium heating}}</ref>\n\n=== Optical properties ===\nOwing to its use as a photoconductor in flat-panel x-ray detectors (see [[#Photoconductors|below]]), the optical properties of amorphous selenium (\u03b1-Se) thin films have been the subject of intense research.<ref name=Jafar2016>{{Cite journal |last1=Jafar |first1=Mousa M.

The pyrite from the [[Falun Mine]] created a red precipitate in the lead chambers which was presumed to be an arsenic compound, so the pyrite's use to make acid was discontinued. Berzelius and Gahn wanted to use the pyrite and they also observed that the red precipitate gave off a smell like [[horseradish]] when burned. This smell was not typical of arsenic, but a similar odor was known from [[tellurium]] compounds. Hence, Berzelius's first letter to [[Alexander Marcet]] stated that this was a tellurium compound. However, the lack of tellurium compounds in the [[Falun Mine]] minerals eventually led Berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate, and in 1818 he wrote a second letter to Marcet describing a newly found element similar to [[sulfur]] and tellurium.

Sources of pollution include waste materials from certain mining, agricultural, petrochemical, and industrial manufacturing operations.  In [[Belews Lake]] North Carolina, 19 species of fish were eliminated from the lake due to 150-200&nbsp;\u03bcg Se/L wastewater discharged from 1974 to 1986 from a Duke Energy coal-fired power plant.  At the [[Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge]] in California, thousands of fish and waterbirds were poisoned by selenium in agricultural irrigation drainage.\n\nSubstantial physiological changes may occur in fish with high tissue concentrations of selenium.  Fish affected by selenium may experience swelling of the gill [[lamella (zoology)|lamella]]e, which impedes oxygen diffusion across the gills and blood flow within the gills.  Respiratory capacity is further reduced due to selenium binding to [[hemoglobin]].  Other problems include degeneration of liver tissue, swelling around the heart, damaged egg follicles in ovaries, cataracts, and accumulation of fluid in the body cavity and head.  Selenium often causes a malformed fish fetus which may have problems feeding or respiring, distortion of the fins or spine is also common.  Adult fish may appear healthy despite their inability to produce viable offspring.\n\nSelenium is [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulated]] in aquatic habitats, this results in higher concentrations in organisms than the surrounding water.  Organoselenium compounds can be concentrated over 200,000 times by [[zooplankton]] when water concentrations are in the 0.5 to 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcg Se/L range.  Inorganic selenium bioaccumulates more readily in [[phytoplankton]] than zooplankton.  Phytoplankton can concentrate inorganic selenium by a factor of 3000.  Further concentration through bioaccumulation occurs along the food chain, as predators consume selenium rich prey.  It is recommended that a water concentration of 2&nbsp;\u03bcg Se/L be considered highly hazardous to sensitive fish and aquatic birds.  Selenium poisoning can be passed from parents to offspring through the egg, and selenium poisoning may persist for many generations. Reproduction of mallard ducks is impaired at dietary concentrations of 7&nbsp;ug Se/L.  Many benthic invertebrates can tolerate selenium concentrations up to 300&nbsp;\u03bcg/L of Se in their diet.<ref>{{cite book| last = Lemly| first = Dennis| title = Selenium Assessment in Aquatic Ecosystems: A guide for hazard evaluation and water quality criteria| publisher = Springer| year = 1998| pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qGH37iOW7yMC&dq=Selenium+Assessment+in+Aquatic+Ecosystems&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=9dDWSa7_IJrulQfu74XLDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4#PPP1,M1| doi = | isbn = 0-387-95346-9}}</ref>\n\n==Biological role==\n{{main|Selenium in biology}}\n{{Chembox\n| Name= Elemental selenium\n| show_footer = no\n|Section7={{Chembox Hazards\n| NFPA-H = 2\n| NFPA-F = 0\n| NFPA-R = 0\n| NFPA-S =\n| NFPA_ref =\n }}\n}}\nAlthough it is toxic in large doses, selenium is an essential [[micronutrient]] for animals.

It is a [[nonmetal]] (more rarely considered a [[metalloid]]) with properties that are intermediate between the elements above and below in the [[periodic table]], [[sulfur]] and [[tellurium]], and also has similarities to [[arsenic]]. It rarely occurs in its elemental state or as pure ore compounds in the Earth's crust. Selenium \u2013 from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|el |\u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7}} (sel\u1e17n\u0113) \"Moon\" \u2013 was discovered in 1817 by [[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]], who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously discovered [[tellurium]] (named for the Earth).\n\nSelenium is found in [[:Category:Sulfide minerals|metal sulfide ores]], where it partially replaces the sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are [[glassmaking]] and [[pigment]]s. Selenium is a [[semiconductor]] and is used in [[photocell]]s. Applications in [[electronics]], once important, have been mostly replaced with [[silicon]] semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power [[surge protector]]s and one type of [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[quantum dot]].\n\nSelenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are necessary for cellular function in many organisms, including all animals. Selenium is an ingredient in many multivitamins and other dietary supplements, including [[infant formula]]. It is a component of the antioxidant enzymes [[glutathione peroxidase]] and [[thioredoxin reductase]] (which indirectly reduce certain [[Redox|oxidized]] molecules in animals and some plants). It is also found in three [[deiodinase]] enzymes, which convert one [[thyroid hormone]] to another. Selenium requirements in plants differ by species, with some plants requiring relatively large amounts and others apparently requiring none.<ref name=\"Ruyle\">{{cite web |url= http://cals.arizona.edu/arec/pubs/rmg/1%20rangelandmanagement/2%20poisonousplants93.pdf |title=Poisonous Plants on Arizona Rangelands |first=George |last=Ruyle |accessdate=2009-01-05 |publisher=The University of Arizona |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040715194026/http://cals.arizona.edu/AREC/pubs/rmg/1%20rangelandmanagement/2%20poisonousplants93.pdf |archivedate=2004-07-15 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n===Physical properties===\n[[File:Selenium trigonal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Structure of hexagonal (gray) selenium]]\nSelenium forms several [[allotrope]]s that interconvert with temperature changes, depending somewhat on the rate of temperature change.

The pyrite from the [[Falun Mine]] created a red precipitate in the lead chambers which was presumed to be an arsenic compound, so the pyrite's use to make acid was discontinued. Berzelius and Gahn wanted to use the pyrite and they also observed that the red precipitate gave off a smell like [[horseradish]] when burned. This smell was not typical of arsenic, but a similar odor was known from [[tellurium]] compounds. Hence, Berzelius's first letter to [[Alexander Marcet]] stated that this was a tellurium compound. However, the lack of tellurium compounds in the [[Falun Mine]] minerals eventually led Berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate, and in 1818 he wrote a second letter to Marcet describing a newly found element similar to [[sulfur]] and tellurium. Because of its similarity to tellurium, named for the Earth, Berzelius named the new element after the [[Moon]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/ed009p474 |title=The discovery of the elements. VI.

Sources of pollution include waste materials from certain mining, agricultural, petrochemical, and industrial manufacturing operations.  In [[Belews Lake]] North Carolina, 19 species of fish were eliminated from the lake due to 150-200&nbsp;\u03bcg Se/L wastewater discharged from 1974 to 1986 from a Duke Energy coal-fired power plant.  At the [[Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge]] in California, thousands of fish and waterbirds were poisoned by selenium in agricultural irrigation drainage.\n\nSubstantial physiological changes may occur in fish with high tissue concentrations of selenium.  Fish affected by selenium may experience swelling of the gill [[lamella (zoology)|lamella]]e, which impedes oxygen diffusion across the gills and blood flow within the gills.  Respiratory capacity is further reduced due to selenium binding to [[hemoglobin]].  Other problems include degeneration of liver tissue, swelling around the heart, damaged egg follicles in ovaries, cataracts, and accumulation of fluid in the body cavity and head.  Selenium often causes a malformed fish fetus which may have problems feeding or respiring, distortion of the fins or spine is also common.  Adult fish may appear healthy despite their inability to produce viable offspring.\n\nSelenium is [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulated]] in aquatic habitats, this results in higher concentrations in organisms than the surrounding water.  Organoselenium compounds can be concentrated over 200,000 times by [[zooplankton]] when water concentrations are in the 0.5 to 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcg Se/L range.  Inorganic selenium bioaccumulates more readily in [[phytoplankton]] than zooplankton.  Phytoplankton can concentrate inorganic selenium by a factor of 3000.  Further concentration through bioaccumulation occurs along the food chain, as predators consume selenium rich prey.  It is recommended that a water concentration of 2&nbsp;\u03bcg Se/L be considered highly hazardous to sensitive fish and aquatic birds.  Selenium poisoning can be passed from parents to offspring through the egg, and selenium poisoning may persist for many generations. Reproduction of mallard ducks is impaired at dietary concentrations of 7&nbsp;ug Se/L.  Many benthic invertebrates can tolerate selenium concentrations up to 300&nbsp;\u03bcg/L of Se in their diet.<ref>{{cite book| last = Lemly| first = Dennis| title = Selenium Assessment in Aquatic Ecosystems: A guide for hazard evaluation and water quality criteria| publisher = Springer| year = 1998| pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qGH37iOW7yMC&dq=Selenium+Assessment+in+Aquatic+Ecosystems&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=9dDWSa7_IJrulQfu74XLDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4#PPP1,M1| doi = | isbn = 0-387-95346-9}}</ref>\n\n==Biological role==\n{{main|Selenium in biology}}\n{{Chembox\n| Name= Elemental selenium\n| show_footer = no\n|Section7={{Chembox Hazards\n| NFPA-H = 2\n| NFPA-F = 0\n| NFPA-R = 0\n| NFPA-S =\n| NFPA_ref =\n }}\n}}\nAlthough it is toxic in large doses, selenium is an essential [[micronutrient]] for animals.

In July 1861, at the start of the war, the Bossier Parish Police Jury appropriated $35,000 for the benefit of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] volunteers and their family members left behind, an amount then considered generous.<ref>[[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, {{ISBN|0-8071-0834-0}}, p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter the war, whites used violence and intimidation to maintain dominance over the newly emancipated [[freedmen]]. From the end of Reconstruction into the 20th century, violence increased as conservative white Democrats struggled to maintain power over the state. In this period, Bossier Parish had 26 lynchings of African Americans by whites, part of racial terrorism. This was the fifth-highest total of any parish in Louisiana, tied with the total in [[Iberia Parish]] in the South of the state.<ref>[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America, Third Edition: Supplement by County''], p. 6, Equal Justice Initiative, Mobile, AL, 2017</ref> Overall, parishes in northwest Louisiana had the highest rates of lynchings.\n\n==Law, government, and politics==\nBossier Parish is governed by a 12-member elected body, the Bossier Parish Police Jury (equivalent to [[county commission]] in other states). Members are elected from [[single-member districts]]. Eddy Shell, a prominent Bossier City [[educator]], was repeatedly re-elected, serving on the police jury from 1992 until his death in 2008.\n\nThe current members of the police jury are :\n\n* District 1 - Hank Meachum\n* District 2 - Glenn Benton\n* District 3 - Wanda Bennett\n* District 4 - Douglas (Sonny) Cook\n* District 5 - Barry Butler\n* District 6 - Rick Avery\n* District 7 - Jimmy Cochran\n* District 8 - J.

Before this, the state was a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party, in the period after the turn of the century when most blacks were disenfranchised in Louisiana.\n\nBossier Parish has since reliably supported [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidatese in most contested US presidential elections. Since 1952, [[George Wallace]], the former [[governor of Alabama]] who ran in 1968 on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket, is the only non-Republican to have carried Bossier Parish.<ref>[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=22&f=1&off=0&elect=0 David Leip's Presidential election Atlas (Louisiana electoral maps]</ref><ref>[http://geoelections.free.fr/USA/elec_comtes/1952.htm Geographie Electorale]</ref>\n\nIn 2008, [[U.S. Senator]] [[John McCain]] of [[Arizona]] won in Bossier Parish with 32,713 votes (71.4 percent) over the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Barack H.

[[Loggy Bayou]] flows south from [[Lake Bistineau]] in southern Bossier Parish, traverses western Bienville Parish, and in [[Red River Parish, Louisiana|Red River Parish]] joins the [[Red River of the South|Red River]].\n\n==History==\n{{stack|clear=true|\n[[Image:Arnold-Tidwell House, Bossier Parish, LA IMG 6496.JPG|thumb|200px|Arnold-Tidwell House near the Cypress Lake recreational area is one of three [[History of the United States (1789\u20131849)|antebellum]] homes still standing in Bossier Parish.<ref>Arnold-Tidwell House, Historical marker, Bossier Parish, Louisiana</ref>]]\n[[Image:Willis Knighton Hospital, Bossier City, LA IMG 3724.JPG|200px|thumb|Willis Knighton Hospital in Bossier City serves much of northern Bossier Parish.]]\n[[Image:Cypress Lake, Bossier Parish, LA IMG 6497.JPG|200px|thumb|Swimmers at Cypress Lake on a cloudy summer day]]\n}}\nBossier Parish is named for [[Pierre Bossier]], an ethnic French, 19th-century [[Louisiana State Senate|Louisiana state senator]] and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. representative]] from [[Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana|Natchitoches Parish]].\n\nBossier Parish was spared fighting on its soil during the [[American Civil War]]. In July 1861, at the start of the war, the Bossier Parish Police Jury appropriated $35,000 for the benefit of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] volunteers and their family members left behind, an amount then considered generous.<ref>[[John D. Winters]], ''The Civil War in Louisiana'', [[Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1963, {{ISBN|0-8071-0834-0}}, p. 38</ref>\n\nAfter the war, whites used violence and intimidation to maintain dominance over the newly emancipated [[freedmen]]. From the end of Reconstruction into the 20th century, violence increased as conservative white Democrats struggled to maintain power over the state. In this period, Bossier Parish had 26 lynchings of African Americans by whites, part of racial terrorism. This was the fifth-highest total of any parish in Louisiana, tied with the total in [[Iberia Parish]] in the South of the state.<ref>[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America, Third Edition: Supplement by County''], p. 6, Equal Justice Initiative, Mobile, AL, 2017</ref> Overall, parishes in northwest Louisiana had the highest rates of lynchings.\n\n==Law, government, and politics==\nBossier Parish is governed by a 12-member elected body, the Bossier Parish Police Jury (equivalent to [[county commission]] in other states). Members are elected from [[single-member districts]]. Eddy Shell, a prominent Bossier City [[educator]], was repeatedly re-elected, serving on the police jury from 1992 until his death in 2008.\n\nThe current members of the police jury are :\n\n* District 1 - Hank Meachum\n* District 2 - Glenn Benton\n* District 3 - Wanda Bennett\n* District 4 - Douglas (Sonny) Cook\n* District 5 - Barry Butler\n* District 6 - Rick Avery\n* District 7 - Jimmy Cochran\n* District 8 - J.

Before this, the state was a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party, in the period after the turn of the century when most blacks were disenfranchised in Louisiana.\n\nBossier Parish has since reliably supported [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidatese in most contested US presidential elections. Since 1952, [[George Wallace]], the former [[governor of Alabama]] who ran in 1968 on the [[American Independent Party]] ticket, is the only non-Republican to have carried Bossier Parish.<ref>[http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=22&f=1&off=0&elect=0 David Leip's Presidential election Atlas (Louisiana electoral maps]</ref><ref>[http://geoelections.free.fr/USA/elec_comtes/1952.htm Geographie Electorale]</ref>\n\nIn 2008, [[U.S. Senator]] [[John McCain]] of [[Arizona]] won in Bossier Parish with 32,713 votes (71.4 percent) over the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Barack H.

Season one unofficially started on December 30, 2000 with the unannounced early morning stealth airing of \"[[Rabbot]]\" on [[Cartoon Network]]. Season one officially began one week after the official launch of [[Adult Swim]], on September 9, 2001 with \"Escape from Leprechaupolis\", and ended with \"Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future\" on December 29, 2002, with a total of eighteen episodes. ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' is about the [[surreal humor|surreal]] adventures and antics of three [[anthropomorphic]] [[fast food]] items: [[Master Shake]], [[Frylock]], and [[Meatwad]], who live together as roommates and frequently interact with their human next-door neighbor, [[Carl Brutananadilewski]] in a [[suburban]] neighborhood in [[South Jersey|South]] [[New Jersey]]. In late March 2013, this season became available on Netflix. In May 2015, this season became available on Hulu Plus.\n\nSeason one marks the first appearance of the main characters, and several recurring characters as well. Episodes in season one were written and directed by [[Dave Willis]] and [[Matt Maiellaro]]. Almost every episode in this season features a special guest appearance, which is later continued in later seasons. This season has been made available on [[DVD]], and other forms of home media, including [[Video on demand|on demand]] streaming.\n\n==Production==\nAll episodes in season one were written and directed by series creators [[Dave Willis]] and [[Matt Maiellaro]]. The first episode from this season, \"[[Rabbot]]\" originally aired in the United States on [[Cartoon Network]], unannounced, on December 30, 2000.<ref name=\"The Daily Ghost Planet : The Past!\">{{cite web|url=http://lustforlunch.com/dgp/oldnews.htm#morestealth |title=The Daily Ghost Planet : The Past! |publisher=Lustforlunch.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-22}}</ref> The remaining episodes from this season originally aired on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, [[Adult Swim]]. As with most seasons, several episodes aired outside of their production order. This season was one of the original seasons produced under the ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' title before Willis and Maiellaro started using [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force#Alternative titles|alternative titles]] for each season in 2011.<ref name=season8No2>{{cite web|last=Ohanesian |first=Liz |title=Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1: Are the Characters from Aqua Teen Hunger Force Really Moving to Seattle? |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/stylecouncil/2011/05/aqua_unit_patrol_squad_1.php |publisher=LAWeekly |date=May 7, 2011 |accessdate=August 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822222822/http://blogs.laweekly.com/stylecouncil/2011/05/aqua_unit_patrol_squad_1.php |archivedate=August 22, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nSeason one marks the first official appearances of Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad, who originated from the then-unproduced ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' episode \"Baffler Meal\" which features their intended designs and personalities. This season also marks the first appearance of their next door neighbor, [[Carl Brutananadilewski]], as well as a number of recurring characters such as Dr. Weird, Steve, Ignignokt, Err, Oglethorpe, Emory, MC Pee Pants, Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, and George Lowe.\n\nThe first three episodes of season one feature [[Master Shake]], [[Frylock]], and [[Meatwad]] as detectives. After three episodes, this premise and the use of the name by the characters were dropped. The premise was a trick that had been added to appease Cartoon Network executives, who \"didn't want to air a show about food just going around and doing random stuff\". In the show itself, Frylock mentions that they stopped fighting crime because \"that wasn't making us a whole lot of money\".<ref name=\"ep_kidney\">Spoken dialogue in Kidney Car</ref> This premise was later revisited in the [[Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1|season eight]] two-part episode \"[[Allen (Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1)|Allen]]\"<ref name=Allen1>{{Cite episode |title=Allen Part One |series=Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1|network=Adult Swim |airdate=May 8, 2011 |season=8 |number=1 |language=English}}</ref><ref name=Allen2>{{Cite episode |title=Allen Part Two|series=Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1|network=Adult Swim |airdate=May 15, 2011 |season=8 |number=2 |language=English}}</ref>\n\n===Cast===\n{{see also|List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force guest stars}}\n\nIn season one the main cast debuted consisting of [[Dana Snyder]] who provided the voice of [[Master Shake]],<ref name=\"Master Shake's Adult Swim page\">{{cite web|last=Eason |first=Jonas |title=Master Shake's character page |url=http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force/Master+Shake |publisher=Adult Swim |accessdate=15 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902094125/http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua%2BTeen%2BHunger%2BForce/Master%2BShake |archivedate=2 September 2011 }}</ref> [[Carey Means]] who provided the voice of [[Frylock]],<ref name=\"Frylock's Adult Swim page\">{{cite web|last=Eason |first=Jonas |title=Frylock's character page |url=http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force/Frylock |publisher=Adult Swim |accessdate=15 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707090719/http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua%2BTeen%2BHunger%2BForce/Frylock |archivedate=7 July 2011 }}</ref> and series co-creator [[Dave Willis]] who provided the voice of both [[Meatwad]] and [[Carl Brutananadilewski]]; and recurring character [[The Mooninites|Ignignokt]].<ref name=\"Meatwad's Adult Swim page\">{{cite web|last=Eason|first=Jonas|title=Meatwad's character page|url=http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force/Meatwad|publisher=Adult Swim|accessdate=15 May 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707090714/http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force/Meatwad|archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Carl's Adult Swim page\">{{cite web|last=Eason |first=Jonas |title=Carl's character page |url=http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force/Carl |publisher=Adult Swim |accessdate=15 May 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=IgnignoktGuide>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080916235602/http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua%2BTeen%2BHunger%2BForce/Ignignokt Ignignokt official character guide] from [[Adult Swim]].

The version that aired on December 30, 2000 featured scenes from the original pitch pilot but were eventually cut from the official version of the episode. Unlike the original version of the pilot, the December 30, 2000 airing was more and rendered completely. \"Rabbot\" was not re aired until the final cut made its official television debut on September 16, 2001 on Adult Swim in the United States, only three weeks after Adult Swim launched on September 2, 2001. The series had already made its official television debut a week earlier with the second episode \"Escape from Leprechaupolis\" on September 9, 2001.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{see also|List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#884400 |overall= 5 |title=20 |director=19 |writer=19 |airdate=15 |prodcode=6 |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list/sublist|Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 1)\n| Title = {{anchor|Rabbot}}[[Rabbot]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2000|12|30}}<br><small>(on [[Cartoon Network]])</small>\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n|DirectedBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n|WrittenBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n| ProdCode = 101\n| LineColor = 884400\n<!--| Aux4 = S01E01\nDo Not delete or expose this information -->| ShortSummary = Dr. Weird builds a titanic robotic rabbit, which spritzes everything it does not smash (such as the Powerpuff Mall and, more importantly, Carl's car) with a hair-growing formula.

The Aqua Teens get involved when both Frylock and Carl receive the phony e-mails; Carl falls for the trick and has his gold chain stolen.

Mothmonsterman threatens trouble for the Aqua Teens if they don't leave their lights on. Master Shake suspects that the school bus from which Mothmonsterman is calling them is actually possessed by Dracula's ghost. Frylock attempts to discover who is threatening them by putting the flag that Mothmonsterman destroyed in his cloner. Eventually, though, Frylock decides to prove to Master Shake that the bus is not Dracula by taking him to Dracula's grave.\n\nWhen the Aqua Teens return home they find Mothmonsterman in their house watching \"Assisted Living Dracula\"; he has encased Carl in a cocoon and laid a thousand eggs in his esophagus, and Carl is \"being a real baby about it\". Shortly thereafter the house is taken over by cloned monsters created when Shake threw a pan of brownies into the cloner, where they spliced with the moth DNA to form Brownie Monsters.\n\n'''Guest appearance''': [[H.

Two short, square-shaped, pixellated aliens exit the ship and knock on Carl's door. They identify themselves as Ignignokt and Err, Mooninites from the inner core of the Moon and members of a race hundreds of years advanced from the people of the Earth. Carl slams the door in their face and the Mooninites decide to go next door to the Aqua Teens' house, where a sign on the lawn says there is a room for rent.\n\nIn their house, Master Shake explains to Meatwad that he is renting out Meatwad's room in order to make money. Shake answers the door and the Mooninites enter. As references, they spin in place and glow. Shake gives them the room. Shakes asks for a deposit, and Ignignokt offers Meatwad's jambox. Shake accepts.\n\nMeatwad complains to the Mooninites about Shake, and they show him how to shoot the bird and smoke cigarettes. Later, after swimming in Carl's pool, they attempt to dry a wet towel over Frylock's computer. Frylock is unhappy to learn that Shake has rented them Meatwad's room. Frylock suspiciously questions the Mooninites and he is not impressed. When Meatwad rolls out of his room smoking a cigarette and asking for alcohol, Frylock is even more incensed. Shake breaks out an electric guitar and says that the Mooninites gave it to him.\n\nMeatwad goes with the Mooninites to the mall, where Ignignokt and Err spit in Meatwad's face until he steals a rack of DVDs while the Mooninites steal televisions and stereo equipment. Frylock must retrieve Meatwad from mall security, while the Mooninites make it back safely and mention that they have gouged expletives into Carl's car. Carl is angry.\n\nOn the way back to their house, Meatwad shows Frylock his tough new clown tattoo. In Carl's pool, Shake and the Mooninites see who can hold their breath underwater the longest. Carl comes outside and complains about the vandalism to his car, and Ignignokt takes out 'Mr. Laser', a pixellated pistol-like gun. He fires a shot at Carl, but it moves extremely slowly. Carl easily moves out of the way and dodges it, but it bounces off his house and hits him in the back, causing him to disappear.\n\nFrylock hovers to the pool, surprising Master Shake. They all go back into the Aqua Teens' house, and while everyone watches a movie on the television about 'Vegetable Man', Frylock tells the Mooninites he wants them to move out. When everyone ignores him, Frylock destroys the television with energy balls from his eyes. The Mooninites are initially impressed by how fast the balls move, but then pretend that the balls were actually primitive.\n\nFrylock and the Mooninites takes their dispute outside, where Frylock uses his fries to plaster their flat two-dimensional bodies against the road. Meatwad rolls outside and shoves Frylock off of them, saying that the Mooninites are his friends. When Err extinguishes a cigarette in Meatwad's eye, Meatwad realizes they may not be his friends after all.\n\nIgnignokt then utters the words 'Mooninites unite', and the smaller Err joins into an Err-shaped slot in the top of Ignignokt, forming the 'Quad Laser', wherein each of their arms holds a pixellated pistol-like gun. After stating that no one can defeat it, the Mooninites fire, shooting an even larger, even slower bullet than before. In response, Frylock shoots them with his energy balls, and the Mooninites quickly flee 'this primitive rock' in their ship.\n\nBack on their ship, the Mooninites raise their middle fingers at the shrinking Earth. At Carl's pool, Shake says he will keep all of the Mooninites' stolen merchandise, because he deserves it. Having landed in a crater on the Moon, the Mooninites find Carl and threaten a 'Moon spanking'.\n\n'''Guest appearance''': Don Kennedy as Vegetable Man (live action).\n'''Note''': This is the first ATHF episode to be rated TV-14.\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 1)\n| Title = {{anchor|5}}Balloonenstein\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|12|23}}\n| EpisodeNumber = 5\n|DirectedBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n|WrittenBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n| ProdCode = 105\n| LineColor = 884400\n<!--| Aux4 = S01E05\nDo Not delete or expose this information -->| ShortSummary = In the opening, Carl is admiring his pool (completely decked out with painted flames and neon lights) and preventing Master Shake from getting anywhere near it because he is weird. Suddenly, a black hole appears in the sky and begins to suck up Carl. Frylock  tries to help by tying a garden hose around his waist and having Shake hold on to it, but Shake ties it to a loosely-fitted gutter, and Frylock and Carl are sucked into the vortex.\n\nInside the house, Shake tricks Meatwad into climbing inside the dryer. When Frylock escapes the vortex (along with Carl, whose hands have grown greatly), he finds Shake inside and berates him for not holding the hose. When the dryer stops and Meatwad exits, he discovers he now has magical static powers (which he promptly uses to send Shake into midair, finally letting him go near the ceiling fan). While mainly using his shots of electricity to torment Shake, he does cause a great deal of harm: he shorts out Frylock's computer, jumps into Carl's pool (while Carl had his hand in it, blasting him across the yard and electrocuting him), and accidentally kills his friend, Squirrely.\n\nFrylock, in a desperate attempt to remove Meatwad's powers, has Meatwad perform a \"balloonism,\" having him take a blown-up balloon (shaped like Squirrely) and rub it over his body. Unfortunately, this doesn't work; the balloon becomes a massive electrified balloon which becomes even larger when Frylock tries to destroy it with electricity from his eyes. Eventually, it floats towards the sea, and the Aqua Teens head towards the beach. Frylock covers Meatwad in shattered glass and throws him in the ocean to pop the balloon; unfortunately, to get him to float, Frylock has to remove Meatwad's brain, causing him to only float around in the water and say \"Do what now?\" over and over. Eventually, another vortex opens, sucking up both the balloon and Meatwad.\n\nBack home, while Shake and Frylock are in Carl's pool (with Shake claiming he could open the sky at his whim), Meatwad reappears, this time ten times his normal size. Meatwad asks Frylock to \"get away from the pool,\" and he then proceeds to jump onto Shake and the pool as the episode ends.\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 1)\n| Title = {{anchor|6}}Space Conflict from Beyond Pluto\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2002|4|7}}\n| EpisodeNumber = 6\n|DirectedBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n|WrittenBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n| ProdCode = 106\n| LineColor = 884400\n<!--| Aux4 = S01E06\nDo Not delete or expose this information -->| ShortSummary = Frylock is repeatedly transmitting the first few notes of La Cucaracha through a satellite dish  on the roof of the Aqua Teen Hunger Force's house when he receives a response in the form of a house-shaking low bass note. Using his computer, Frylock contacts the aliens and opens a video feed. Two aliens, one green and one orange, both basically just a mass of spikes with heads, are barbecuing watermelon (which has ignited), some type of bird, and meat on a grill. They assure Frylock that the fact that they are barbecuing means they are peaceful.\n\nThe Plutonians, Oglethorpe and Emory, argue over whether they have laser eyes, then invite Frylock up to their ship. Although Oglethorpe is unsure whether they possess a transporter device, Emory knows they do and initiates the transport. As Frylock is transporting, Oglethorpe knocks over the barbecue, demanding that the 'gross shanks of meat leave his dominion' and prompting Emory to warn him about burning down the ship. Oglethorpe reveals that he has a plan to betray Frylock - he will melt him, in the 'Meltorium'. Emory objects, thinking they were just going to hang out, but Oglethorpe insists.\n\nFrylock appears with a six-pack of beer. Oglethorpe initially does not recognize Frylock, but then invites him into the Meltorium. Frylock declines. After a bit of conversation about the Plutonians' sweatbands/headbands, Oglethorpe again invites Frylock to the Meltorium, but he again declines. Frylock asks about their spikes, which Oglethorpe says are pointy arms. Emory explains that the spikes eject soap, and when Frylock says it smells like waste, Emory further explains that what is soap to one person is waste to another. Oglethorpe again attempts to lure Frylock into the Meltorium by 'tossing a frisbee' at it, but he only drops it and stomps on it.\n\nFrylock asks if there is a higher brain form with which he could speak, but there isn't. When Oglethorpe states that the Plutonians' plan is to dominate the world, Frylock expresses his doubt that they could succeed and starts hitting random buttons in an effort to beam himself back home. Instead, he beams Master Shake aboard. Frylock finds the correct button and beams himself back to Earth. The Plutonians' stare at Shake open-mouthed, seemingly shocked by his appearance. Oglethorpe finally expresses his desire to blow up the Earth, though he seems unsure if that is actually his plan. Shake does not care and lies down to rest his back, which he says hurts after the transporting. Oglethorpe and Emory drag Shake into the Meltorium.\n\nBack at home, Meatwad shows Frylock how he set a small piece of the carpet ablaze. Frylock chides him about using fire, but Meatwad has already melted the siding off of Carl's house in an effort to 'cut his grass'. Carl, who originally paid Shake to cut his lawn, tells Frylock and Meatwad that he wants to talk to him as soon as possible.\n\nBack on the Plutonians' ship, Emory and Oglethorpe search in vain for the remote control that activates the Meltorium. In an effort to occupy Shake they shove a few magazines through a slot at the bottom of the door, but Shake isn't interested. The Plutonians then activate an 'underwater pizza' scenario, which turns the apparent background of the Meltorium into a looping video of a slice of pizza being pushed through an aquarium.\n\nThe 'space phone' starts ringing, and the Plutonians realize that they have left it in the Meltorium. The space phone, a small robot with phone handsets for arms, rolls up to Shake, who answers it. Oglethorpe opens the door to the Meltorium and grabs the phone from Shake, but it's Frylock and he wants to talk to Shake. Frylock tells him Carl wants to talk to him, and Shake says he's unavailable, but Carl can see him on Frylock's computer. Carl expresses his anger at Shake, but Shake states that some things simply carry risk. Carl threatens to slice Shake into pieces. Shake hangs up the phone.\n\nShake grows bored of the pizza video, so the Plutonians play him \"This Horse's Anus\". After several minutes, Shake exits the Meltorium, explaining that the video was amazing, while the Plutonians watch in stunned horror. Shake states that he really enjoys the Plutonians' neat stuff, and they lure him out into space with the promise of a $100 bill. Shake, inside a small egg-shaped pod, searches for the money, but the Plutonians fly away.\n\nShake lands back on Earth in front of Carl's house. Carl, brandishing a tire iron, jumps into the pod so that he can show Shake the finish on it 'up close'.\n\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 1)\n| Title = {{anchor|7}}Ol' Drippy\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2002|4|21}}\n| EpisodeNumber = 7\n|DirectedBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n|WrittenBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n| ProdCode = 107\n| LineColor = 884400\n<!--| Aux4 = S01E07\nDo Not delete or expose this information -->| ShortSummary = Shake's laziness leads to an enormous mess in the kitchen.

Shake has the brain, however, and is using it for \"undercover aquatic training.\" Frylock rips it away from Shake, and discovers the truth... Meatwad's brain is a cat toy!\n\nUpon discovering this, Meatwad suddenly becomes both depressed and unaware of his surroundings. First, Carl throws him out of his window after Meatwad mistakenly thought his bedroom was his, and then he spends the next three days in the doorway of the Aqua Teens' house while ants crawl and build anthills around him. Frylock tries to convince him to come in, but Meatwad says that time and space are a mystery to him because he doesn't have a brain.\n\nFrylock decides that the best way to make Meatwad feel better about himself is to find him a new brain. After Frylock measures the circumference of Carl's skull, Carl catches on and decides to give his friend Terry a call (the same Terry that Dr. Weird called earlier) and get a brain on the black market. Said brain arrives on the Aqua Teens' doorstep in a cooler the next day. Frylock apparently puts the brain into Meatwad's head, and the results are obvious. Meatwad's brain and body slowly grow and grow until they both are ridiculously huge and Meatwad's intellect grows to match.\n\nThings come to a head when an arrogant Meatwad uses his brain to make Carl's car levitate and give kids rides in it for $5. When confronted by Frylock, Meatwad scolds him for getting in the way of his \"financial superbrain.\" Frylock then yanks Meatwad's brain out of his head, revealing that he just stuck his old toy brain in there and left the donor brain in the cooler.

Meatwad wants Jiggle Billy, with the musket and the night vision goggles, but Frylock thinks he's too expensive so they purchase Happy Time Harry instead, a balding, drug-addicted action figure wearing nothing but shorts and red dancing shoes.\n\nBack at home, Happy Time Harry threatens Meatwad with the knife attachment at the end of his right arm. Meatwad asks him if he likes dancing, to which Harry replies, \"Not now, not ever.\" Harry reveals he doesn't actually dance because of a back injury and shows Meatwad his 'action bills', then lies down to take a nap. Meatwad tells Frylock that Harry is depressed, and Frylock writes out a check for $1,000,000 in 'fun money' on a Post-It. Harry tells Meatwad that what he needs is pills, to make the phone calls stop, so Frylock writes a Post-It prescription for 'jolly sunshine happiness.' Meatwad refuses to take it to Harry, and Frylock confronts Harry and discovers that he has drunk all of the Aqua Teens' root beer and triple sec (although he did not get to the tequila Frylock was going to use for margaritas, and he wasn't happy about hearing that). Periodically, Harry spontaneously vomits on the floor and/or passes out. Master Shake comes into Meatwad's room to torture him, but Happy Time Harry and Meatwad tell Shake to just 'do' (kill) Happy Time Harry. Outside, Shake threatens to kill Harry with a blowtorch, but Harry is so gung-ho about getting killed that Shake becomes unnerved and backs off.\n\nDispleased with Happy Time Harry's attitude, Frylock purchases Jiggle Billy after all, but even his belly jiggling can't cheer up Meatwad and Harry. Outside the house, Meatwad, Jiggle Billy, and Happy Time Harry play, but Happy Time brings Jiggle Billy to such an emotional low that Jiggle Billy blows his own head off with his musket, though he survives. Frylock threatens to kill Happy Time, but Shake instead says they will make Happy Time immortal ('Highlander-style') as a suitable torture for the suicidal doll, by tossing him off a cliff.\n\nThe Aqua Teens stand atop a cliff, and after a short argument about whether or not this scenario was even in Highlander at all, Shake tosses Happy Time somewhere far below. Shake then jumps off the cliff, thinking he's immortal, but his straw catches on a branch and he decides he isn't.

After Meatwad says that Shake wouldn't know because he doesn't have any teeth (which actually isn't true), Shake claims that he got rid of them because he was straight, and that teeth are for gay people -- \"that's why fairies come and get them.\"\n\nThey then head into Frylock's room and decide to get to the bottom of this, with Shake searching for \"teeth, 'plaque conspiracy', and Metallica\" on the Internet. After Meatwad tries to convince Shake to include Justin Timberlake in the search, Shake threatens to stab his mouth shut with skewers and cut him up with an ax, causing Meatwad to cry. After he's calmed down, Meatwad notices a pop-up on the screen, which Shake clicks. This, of course, brings more and more pop-ups onto the screen. Eventually, the problem grows and grows until the room itself is full of real-life pop-up ads, and the computer is destroyed by a pop-up slicing the monitor when it is created. However, the ads keep popping up, and they can't be closed out for whatever reason.\n\nFrylock gets home during this, and finds out just what has happened after Meatwad blows their cover.

Finally, after Frylock pulls the fuse out in his room, one final popup comes up, revealing the Internet's ruler, the Wizard (actually spelled Www.yzzerdd.com). After Frylock tries and fails to get him to get rid of all the pop ups, he enters the internet and tries to get the Wizard to stop with the pop ups. The Wizard tries to convince him of the benefits of staying with the Internet service he has now, going as far as to show him what is going on next door at Carl's house.

He has come to show Carl what Christmas was like for Carl in 1968. A flashback shows a young Carl and his father. Carl opens his \"present\", which he hopes is \"a new mommy\", but instead is a piece of berber carpet, which apparently is also his dinner. Carl's dad says that it's time to go to work at the insulation factory, and for Carl to put on his respirator and work boots. Suddenly, a huge robot stomps in the room and shoots lasers everywhere. Carl remembers eating carpet, but not the lasers and the robots. The ghost claims that the reason he doesn't remember is because it was only a prophecy, but in the future, the past has occurred. Carl reminds the robot that it's not Christmas at all, but in fact February. The robot leaves in a cloud of smoke, saying he'll be back in December, \"tomorrow\". When Carl tries to tell him to lock the door on his way out, the robot smashes through the door.\n\nMaster Shake shows up to tell Carl that his pool is full of blood, not that stuff what turns red when you pee in it, admitting he has had to pee in Carl's pool a number of times. Carl comments on how it looks like \"someone ran a heard of cows through a juicer or something\". Frylock determines it to be elfin blood. When Carl demands to know who had done this, the ghost arrives and informs them all that he is responsible for the blood. Frylock asks him why, and he goes into a long story, explaining how thousands of years ago, an ape named \"Sir Santa of Claus\" enslaved alien elves to make toys, then became lost during the Ice Age and built his house in the exact spot where Carl's house currently sits. Meatwad is frightened that the whole story is true, but Frylock assures him that it's not. The ghost changes his story, saying Santa is now a machine. Frylock reminds the ghost that he still hasn't explained the elf blood, and he says that it was due to an event called the \"great circuiting.\" He then goes back into another story, and talks all through the night, ending with an explanation of where babies come from--for machines. Everyone else has fallen asleep from boredom, and Carl has passed out drunk, but Meatwad is still engaged in conversation with the \"Ghost.\" When they awaken Frylock, they reveal the answer to the question he asked the Ghost hours before: the blood is in the pool because Carl's house was built on elf graves, and the ghost is haunting it because Carl desecrated the land because he lives there. The only way to end it is for Carl to give himself sexually to the \"Great Red Ape.\"\n\nCarl would much rather just move out, though, so he packs his boxes. He gets ready to take a shower to get ready for some potential buyers for his house, but ends up covered in elfin blood. He ends up showing the house to Glenn Danzig. He explains the features of the house and the shrieking robot that comes with it, and shows him the pool, still filled with blood. Danzig loves all this, since it perfectly fits his (famously) morbid taste. He asks for a price, and accepts Carl's offer of a million. After moving in, he runs sprinklers which spray blood all over the front yard and house, and comes over to the Aqua Teens' house, looking for the robot, which he says he cannot find. Shake says he hasn't seen him, but does show Danzig a \"haunted kitchen,\" which is Meatwad covered in a blanket with the lights flipping on and off, in an attempt to get Danzig to buy their house. Danzig gets angry and leaves, cursing at Shake that if he finds out the robot's in his house, that he will use Shake's skull as a bowl to eat his cereal out of. Meatwad tells the ghost to come out from the hallway. The ghost says that he is freaked out and annoyed by Danzig (\"He doesn't wear a shirt\"). Shake orders him to make their house bleed.\n\n'''Guest appearance''': [[Glenn Danzig]] as Danzig\n}}}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Home release==\n{{See also|Aqua Teen Hunger Force#Home releases|l1=List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force DVDs}}\nA sampler disc that was paired with Space Ghost Coast to Coast was given to less than 50,000 people at the 2003 [[San Diego Comic Con]] featuring the episode Mayhem of the Mooninites but it was labeled as just  Mooninites.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20090104152253/http://www.novirginsallowed.com/adultswim/reviews/dvdsampler_kon.html</ref>\nThe first sixteen episodes from season one were released on the ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Volume One'' [[DVD]] on November 18, 2003.

Season one unofficially started on December 30, 2000 with the unannounced early morning stealth airing of \"[[Rabbot]]\" on [[Cartoon Network]]. Season one officially began one week after the official launch of [[Adult Swim]], on September 9, 2001 with \"Escape from Leprechaupolis\", and ended with \"Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future\" on December 29, 2002, with a total of eighteen episodes. ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' is about the [[surreal humor|surreal]] adventures and antics of three [[anthropomorphic]] [[fast food]] items: [[Master Shake]], [[Frylock]], and [[Meatwad]], who live together as roommates and frequently interact with their human next-door neighbor, [[Carl Brutananadilewski]] in a [[suburban]] neighborhood in [[South Jersey|South]] [[New Jersey]]. In late March 2013, this season became available on Netflix. In May 2015, this season became available on Hulu Plus.\n\nSeason one marks the first appearance of the main characters, and several recurring characters as well. Episodes in season one were written and directed by [[Dave Willis]] and [[Matt Maiellaro]]. Almost every episode in this season features a special guest appearance, which is later continued in later seasons. This season has been made available on [[DVD]], and other forms of home media, including [[Video on demand|on demand]] streaming.\n\n==Production==\nAll episodes in season one were written and directed by series creators [[Dave Willis]] and [[Matt Maiellaro]]. The first episode from this season, \"[[Rabbot]]\" originally aired in the United States on [[Cartoon Network]], unannounced, on December 30, 2000.<ref name=\"The Daily Ghost Planet : The Past!\">{{cite web|url=http://lustforlunch.com/dgp/oldnews.htm#morestealth |title=The Daily Ghost Planet : The Past! |publisher=Lustforlunch.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-22}}</ref> The remaining episodes from this season originally aired on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, [[Adult Swim]]. As with most seasons, several episodes aired outside of their production order. This season was one of the original seasons produced under the ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' title before Willis and Maiellaro started using [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force#Alternative titles|alternative titles]] for each season in 2011.<ref name=season8No2>{{cite web|last=Ohanesian |first=Liz |title=Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1: Are the Characters from Aqua Teen Hunger Force Really Moving to Seattle? |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/stylecouncil/2011/05/aqua_unit_patrol_squad_1.php |publisher=LAWeekly |date=May 7, 2011 |accessdate=August 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822222822/http://blogs.laweekly.com/stylecouncil/2011/05/aqua_unit_patrol_squad_1.php |archivedate=August 22, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nSeason one marks the first official appearances of Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad, who originated from the then-unproduced ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' episode \"Baffler Meal\" which features their intended designs and personalities. This season also marks the first appearance of their next door neighbor, [[Carl Brutananadilewski]], as well as a number of recurring characters such as Dr. Weird, Steve, Ignignokt, Err, Oglethorpe, Emory, MC Pee Pants, Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, and George Lowe.\n\nThe first three episodes of season one feature [[Master Shake]], [[Frylock]], and [[Meatwad]] as detectives. After three episodes, this premise and the use of the name by the characters were dropped. The premise was a trick that had been added to appease Cartoon Network executives, who \"didn't want to air a show about food just going around and doing random stuff\". In the show itself, Frylock mentions that they stopped fighting crime because \"that wasn't making us a whole lot of money\".<ref name=\"ep_kidney\">Spoken dialogue in Kidney Car</ref> This premise was later revisited in the [[Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1|season eight]] two-part episode \"[[Allen (Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1)|Allen]]\"<ref name=Allen1>{{Cite episode |title=Allen Part One |series=Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1|network=Adult Swim |airdate=May 8, 2011 |season=8 |number=1 |language=English}}</ref><ref name=Allen2>{{Cite episode |title=Allen Part Two|series=Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1|network=Adult Swim |airdate=May 15, 2011 |season=8 |number=2 |language=English}}</ref>\n\n===Cast===\n{{see also|List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force guest stars}}\n\nIn season one the main cast debuted consisting of [[Dana Snyder]] who provided the voice of [[Master Shake]],<ref name=\"Master Shake's Adult Swim page\">{{cite web|last=Eason |first=Jonas |title=Master Shake's character page |url=http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force/Master+Shake |publisher=Adult Swim |accessdate=15 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902094125/http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua%2BTeen%2BHunger%2BForce/Master%2BShake |archivedate=2 September 2011 }}</ref> [[Carey Means]] who provided the voice of [[Frylock]],<ref name=\"Frylock's Adult Swim page\">{{cite web|last=Eason |first=Jonas |title=Frylock's character page |url=http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force/Frylock |publisher=Adult Swim |accessdate=15 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707090719/http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua%2BTeen%2BHunger%2BForce/Frylock |archivedate=7 July 2011 }}</ref> and series co-creator [[Dave Willis]] who provided the voice of both [[Meatwad]] and [[Carl Brutananadilewski]]; and recurring character [[The Mooninites|Ignignokt]].<ref name=\"Meatwad's Adult Swim page\">{{cite web|last=Eason|first=Jonas|title=Meatwad's character page|url=http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force/Meatwad|publisher=Adult Swim|accessdate=15 May 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707090714/http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force/Meatwad|archivedate=7 July 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Carl's Adult Swim page\">{{cite web|last=Eason |first=Jonas |title=Carl's character page |url=http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua+Teen+Hunger+Force/Carl |publisher=Adult Swim |accessdate=15 May 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=IgnignoktGuide>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080916235602/http://wiki.adultswim.com/xwiki/bin/Aqua%2BTeen%2BHunger%2BForce/Ignignokt Ignignokt official character guide] from [[Adult Swim]].

The version that aired on December 30, 2000 featured scenes from the original pitch pilot but were eventually cut from the official version of the episode. Unlike the original version of the pilot, the December 30, 2000 airing was more and rendered completely. \"Rabbot\" was not re aired until the final cut made its official television debut on September 16, 2001 on Adult Swim in the United States, only three weeks after Adult Swim launched on September 2, 2001.

The Aqua Teens get involved when both Frylock and Carl receive the phony e-mails; Carl falls for the trick and has his gold chain stolen.

Master Shake suspects that the school bus from which Mothmonsterman is calling them is actually possessed by Dracula's ghost. Frylock attempts to discover who is threatening them by putting the flag that Mothmonsterman destroyed in his cloner. Eventually, though, Frylock decides to prove to Master Shake that the bus is not Dracula by taking him to Dracula's grave.\n\nWhen the Aqua Teens return home they find Mothmonsterman in their house watching \"Assisted Living Dracula\"; he has encased Carl in a cocoon and laid a thousand eggs in his esophagus, and Carl is \"being a real baby about it.\" Shortly thereafter the house is taken over by cloned monsters created when Shake threw a pan of brownies into the cloner, where they spliced with the moth DNA to form Brownie Monsters.\n\n'''Guest appearance''': [[H.

Two short, square-shaped, pixellated aliens exit the ship and knock on Carl's door. They identify themselves as Ignignokt and Err, Mooninites from the inner core of the Moon and members of a race hundreds of years advanced from the people of the Earth. Carl slams the door in their face and the Mooninites decide to go next door to the Aqua Teens' house, where a sign on the lawn says there is a room for rent.\n\nIn their house, Master Shake explains to Meatwad that he is renting out Meatwad's room in order to make money. Shake answers the door and the Mooninites enter. As references, they spin in place and glow. Shake gives them the room. Shakes asks for a deposit, and Ignignokt offers Meatwad's jambox. Shake accepts.\n\nMeatwad complains to the Mooninites about Shake, and they show him how to shoot the bird and smoke cigarettes. Later, after swimming in Carl's pool, they attempt to dry a wet towel over Frylock's computer. Frylock is unhappy to learn that Shake has rented them Meatwad's room. Frylock suspiciously questions the Mooninites and he is not impressed. When Meatwad rolls out of his room smoking a cigarette and asking for alcohol, Frylock is even more incensed. Shake breaks out an electric guitar and says that the Mooninites gave it to him.\n\nMeatwad goes with the Mooninites to the mall, where Ignignokt and Err spit in Meatwad's face until he steals a rack of DVDs while the Mooninites steal televisions and stereo equipment. Frylock must retrieve Meatwad from mall security, while the Mooninites make it back safely and mention that they have gouged expletives into Carl's car. Carl is angry.\n\nOn the way back to their house, Meatwad shows Frylock his tough new clown tattoo. In Carl's pool, Shake and the Mooninites see who can hold their breath underwater the longest. Carl comes outside and complains about the vandalism to his car, and Ignignokt takes out 'Mr. Laser', a pixellated pistol-like gun. He fires a shot at Carl, but it moves extremely slowly. Carl easily moves out of the way and dodges it, but it bounces off his house and hits him in the back, causing him to disappear.\n\nFrylock hovers to the pool, surprising Master Shake. They all go back into the Aqua Teens' house, and while everyone watches a movie on the television about 'Vegetable Man', Frylock tells the Mooninites he wants them to move out. When everyone ignores him, Frylock destroys the television with energy balls from his eyes. The Mooninites are initially impressed by how fast the balls move, but then pretend that the balls were actually primitive.\n\nFrylock and the Mooninites takes their dispute outside, where Frylock uses his fries to plaster their flat two-dimensional bodies against the road. Meatwad rolls outside and shoves Frylock off of them, saying that the Mooninites are his friends. When Err extinguishes a cigarette in Meatwad's eye, Meatwad realizes they may not be his friends after all.\n\nIgnignokt then utters the words 'Mooninites unite', and the smaller Err joins into an Err-shaped slot in the top of Ignignokt, forming the 'Quad Laser', wherein each of their arms holds a pixellated pistol-like gun. After stating that no one can defeat it, the Mooninites fire, shooting an even larger, even slower bullet than before. In response, Frylock shoots them with his energy balls, and the Mooninites quickly flee 'this primitive rock' in their ship.\n\nBack on their ship, the Mooninites raise their middle fingers at the shrinking Earth. At Carl's pool, Shake says he will keep all of the Mooninites' stolen merchandise, because he deserves it. Having landed in a crater on the Moon, the Mooninites find Carl and threaten a 'Moon spanking'.\n\n'''Guest appearance''': Don Kennedy as Vegetable Man (live action).\n'''Note''': This is the first ATHF episode to be rated TV-14.\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 1)\n| Title = {{anchor|5}}Balloonenstein\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|12|23}}\n| EpisodeNumber = 5\n|DirectedBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n|WrittenBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n| ProdCode = 105\n| LineColor = 884400\n<!--| Aux4 = S01E05\nDo Not delete or expose this information -->| ShortSummary = In the opening, Carl is admiring his pool (completely decked out with painted flames and neon lights) and preventing Master Shake from getting anywhere near it because he is weird. Suddenly, a black hole appears in the sky and begins to suck up Carl. Frylock  tries to help by tying a garden hose around his waist and having Shake hold on to it, but Shake ties it to a loosely-fitted gutter, and Frylock and Carl are sucked into the vortex.\n\nInside the house, Shake tricks Meatwad into climbing inside the dryer. When Frylock escapes the vortex (along with Carl, whose hands have grown greatly), he finds Shake inside and berates him for not holding the hose. When the dryer stops and Meatwad exits, he discovers he now has magical static powers (which he promptly uses to send Shake into midair, finally letting him go near the ceiling fan). While mainly using his shots of electricity to torment Shake, he does cause a great deal of harm: he shorts out Frylock's computer, jumps into Carl's pool (while Carl had his hand in it, blasting him across the yard and electrocuting him), and accidentally kills his friend, Squirrely.\n\nFrylock, in a desperate attempt to remove Meatwad's powers, has Meatwad perform a \"balloonism,\" having him take a blown-up balloon (shaped like Squirrely) and rub it over his body. Unfortunately, this doesn't work; the balloon becomes a massive electrified balloon which becomes even larger when Frylock tries to destroy it with electricity from his eyes. Eventually, it floats towards the sea, and the Aqua Teens head towards the beach. Frylock covers Meatwad in shattered glass and throws him in the ocean to pop the balloon; unfortunately, to get him to float, Frylock has to remove Meatwad's brain, causing him to only float around in the water and say \"Do what now?\" over and over. Eventually, another vortex opens, sucking up both the balloon and Meatwad.\n\nBack home, while Shake and Frylock are in Carl's pool (with Shake claiming he could open the sky at his whim), Meatwad reappears, this time ten times his normal size. Meatwad asks Frylock to \"get away from the pool,\" and he then proceeds to jump onto Shake and the pool as the episode ends.\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 1)\n| Title = {{anchor|6}}Space Conflict from Beyond Pluto\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2002|4|7}}\n| EpisodeNumber = 6\n|DirectedBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n|WrittenBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n| ProdCode = 106\n| LineColor = 884400\n<!--| Aux4 = S01E06\nDo Not delete or expose this information -->| ShortSummary = Frylock is repeatedly transmitting the first few notes of La Cucaracha through a satellite dish  on the roof of the Aqua Teen Hunger Force's house when he receives a response in the form of a house-shaking low bass note. Using his computer, Frylock contacts the aliens and opens a video feed. Two aliens, one green and one orange, both basically just a mass of spikes with heads, are barbecuing watermelon (which has ignited), some type of bird, and meat on a grill. They assure Frylock that the fact that they are barbecuing means they are peaceful.\n\nThe Plutonians, Oglethorpe and Emory, argue over whether they have laser eyes, then invite Frylock up to their ship. Although Oglethorpe is unsure whether they possess a transporter device, Emory knows they do and initiates the transport. As Frylock is transporting, Oglethorpe knocks over the barbecue, demanding that the 'gross shanks of meat leave his dominion' and prompting Emory to warn him about burning down the ship. Oglethorpe reveals that he has a plan to betray Frylock - he will melt him, in the 'Meltorium'. Emory objects, thinking they were just going to hang out, but Oglethorpe insists.\n\nFrylock appears with a six-pack of beer. Oglethorpe initially does not recognize Frylock, but then invites him into the Meltorium. Frylock declines. After a bit of conversation about the Plutonians' sweatbands/headbands, Oglethorpe again invites Frylock to the Meltorium, but he again declines. Frylock asks about their spikes, which Oglethorpe says are pointy arms. Emory explains that the spikes eject soap, and when Frylock says it smells like waste, Emory further explains that what is soap to one person is waste to another. Oglethorpe again attempts to lure Frylock into the Meltorium by 'tossing a frisbee' at it, but he only drops it and stomps on it.\n\nFrylock asks if there is a higher brain form with which he could speak, but there isn't. When Oglethorpe states that the Plutonians' plan is to dominate the world, Frylock expresses his doubt that they could succeed and starts hitting random buttons in an effort to beam himself back home. Instead, he beams Master Shake aboard. Frylock finds the correct button and beams himself back to Earth. The Plutonians' stare at Shake open-mouthed, seemingly shocked by his appearance. Oglethorpe finally expresses his desire to blow up the Earth, though he seems unsure if that is actually his plan. Shake does not care and lies down to rest his back, which he says hurts after the transporting. Oglethorpe and Emory drag Shake into the Meltorium.\n\nBack at home, Meatwad shows Frylock how he set a small piece of the carpet ablaze. Frylock chides him about using fire, but Meatwad has already melted the siding off of Carl's house in an effort to 'cut his grass'. Carl, who originally paid Shake to cut his lawn, tells Frylock and Meatwad that he wants to talk to him as soon as possible.\n\nBack on the Plutonians' ship, Emory and Oglethorpe search in vain for the remote control that activates the Meltorium. In an effort to occupy Shake they shove a few magazines through a slot at the bottom of the door, but Shake isn't interested. The Plutonians then activate an 'underwater pizza' scenario, which turns the apparent background of the Meltorium into a looping video of a slice of pizza being pushed through an aquarium.\n\nThe 'space phone' starts ringing, and the Plutonians realize that they have left it in the Meltorium. The space phone, a small robot with phone handsets for arms, rolls up to Shake, who answers it. Oglethorpe opens the door to the Meltorium and grabs the phone from Shake, but it's Frylock and he wants to talk to Shake. Frylock tells him Carl wants to talk to him, and Shake says he's unavailable, but Carl can see him on Frylock's computer. Carl expresses his anger at Shake, but Shake states that some things simply carry risk. Carl threatens to slice Shake into pieces. Shake hangs up the phone.\n\nShake grows bored of the pizza video, so the Plutonians play him \"This Horse's Anus\". After several minutes, Shake exits the Meltorium, explaining that the video was amazing, while the Plutonians watch in stunned horror. Shake states that he really enjoys the Plutonians' neat stuff, and they lure him out into space with the promise of a $100 bill. Shake, inside a small egg-shaped pod, searches for the money, but the Plutonians fly away.\n\nShake lands back on Earth in front of Carl's house. Carl, brandishing a tire iron, jumps into the pod so that he can show Shake the finish on it 'up close'.\n\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 1)\n| Title = {{anchor|7}}Ol' Drippy\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2002|4|21}}\n| EpisodeNumber = 7\n|DirectedBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n|WrittenBy = Dave Willis & Matt Maiellaro\n| ProdCode = 107\n| LineColor = 884400\n<!--| Aux4 = S01E07\nDo Not delete or expose this information -->| ShortSummary = Shake's laziness leads to an enormous mess in the kitchen.

Shake has the brain, however, and is using it for \"undercover aquatic training.\" Frylock rips it away from Shake, and discovers the truth... Meatwad's brain is a cat toy!\n\nUpon discovering this, Meatwad suddenly becomes both depressed and unaware of his surroundings. First, Carl throws him out of his window after Meatwad mistakenly thought his bedroom was his, and then he spends the next three days in the doorway of the Aqua Teens' house while ants crawl and build anthills around him. Frylock tries to convince him to come in, but Meatwad says that time and space are a mystery to him because he doesn't have a brain.\n\nFrylock decides that the best way to make Meatwad feel better about himself is to find him a new brain. After Frylock measures the circumference of Carl's skull, Carl catches on and decides to give his friend Terry a call (the same Terry that Dr. Weird called earlier) and get a brain on the black market. Said brain arrives on the Aqua Teens' doorstep in a cooler the next day. Frylock apparently puts the brain into Meatwad's head, and the results are obvious. Meatwad's brain and body slowly grow and grow until they both are ridiculously huge and Meatwad's intellect grows to match.\n\nThings come to a head when an arrogant Meatwad uses his brain to make Carl's car levitate and give kids rides in it for $5. When confronted by Frylock, Meatwad scolds him for getting in the way of his \"financial superbrain.\" Frylock then yanks Meatwad's brain out of his head, revealing that he just stuck his old toy brain in there and left the donor brain in the cooler.

Meatwad wants Jiggle Billy, with the musket and the night vision goggles, but Frylock thinks he's too expensive so they purchase Happy Time Harry instead, a balding, drug-addicted action figure wearing nothing but shorts and red dancing shoes.\n\nBack at home, Happy Time Harry threatens Meatwad with the knife attachment at the end of his right arm. Meatwad asks him if he likes dancing, to which Harry replies, \"Not now, not ever.\" Harry reveals he doesn't actually dance because of a back injury and shows Meatwad his 'action bills', then lies down to take a nap. Meatwad tells Frylock that Harry is depressed, and Frylock writes out a check for $1,000,000 in 'fun money' on a Post-It. Harry tells Meatwad that what he needs is pills, to make the phone calls stop, so Frylock writes a Post-It prescription for 'jolly sunshine happiness.' Meatwad refuses to take it to Harry, and Frylock confronts Harry and discovers that he has drunk all of the Aqua Teens' root beer and triple sec (although he did not get to the tequila Frylock was going to use for margaritas, and he wasn't happy about hearing that). Periodically, Harry spontaneously vomits on the floor and/or passes out. Master Shake comes into Meatwad's room to torture him, but Happy Time Harry and Meatwad tell Shake to just 'do' (kill) Happy Time Harry. Outside, Shake threatens to kill Harry with a blowtorch, but Harry is so gung-ho about getting killed that Shake becomes unnerved and backs off.\n\nDispleased with Happy Time Harry's attitude, Frylock purchases Jiggle Billy after all, but even his belly jiggling can't cheer up Meatwad and Harry. Outside the house, Meatwad, Jiggle Billy, and Happy Time Harry play, but Happy Time brings Jiggle Billy to such an emotional low that Jiggle Billy blows his own head off with his musket, though he survives. Frylock threatens to kill Happy Time, but Shake instead says they will make Happy Time immortal ('Highlander-style') as a suitable torture for the suicidal doll, by tossing him off a cliff.\n\nThe Aqua Teens stand atop a cliff, and after a short argument about whether or not this scenario was even in Highlander at all, Shake tosses Happy Time somewhere far below. Shake then jumps off the cliff, thinking he's immortal, but his straw catches on a branch and he decides he isn't.

After Meatwad says that Shake wouldn't know because he doesn't have any teeth (which actually isn't true), Shake claims that he got rid of them because he was straight, and that teeth are for gay people -- \"that's why fairies come and get them.\"\n\nThey then head into Frylock's room and decide to get to the bottom of this, with Shake searching for \"teeth, 'plaque conspiracy', and Metallica\" on the Internet. After Meatwad tries to convince Shake to include Justin Timberlake in the search, Shake threatens to stab his mouth shut with skewers and cut him up with an ax, causing Meatwad to cry. After he's calmed down, Meatwad notices a pop-up on the screen, which Shake clicks. This, of course, brings more and more pop-ups onto the screen. Eventually, the problem grows and grows until the room itself is full of real-life pop-up ads, and the computer is destroyed by a pop-up slicing the monitor when it is created. However, the ads keep popping up, and they can't be closed out for whatever reason.\n\nFrylock gets home during this, and finds out just what has happened after Meatwad blows their cover.

Finally, after Frylock pulls the fuse out in his room, one final popup comes up, revealing the Internet's ruler, the Wizard (actually spelled Www.yzzerdd.com). After Frylock tries and fails to get him to get rid of all the pop ups, he enters the internet and tries to get the Wizard to stop with the pop ups. The Wizard tries to convince him of the benefits of staying with the Internet service he has now, going as far as to show him what is going on next door at Carl's house. Carl is not pleased with the pop-ups, being unable to breathe because of the space they take up and unable to get to his bathroom because it \"is currently being blocked by some stupid ass hit the monkey game\".

He has come to show Carl what Christmas was like for Carl in 1968. A flashback shows a young Carl and his father. Carl opens his \"present\", which he hopes is \"a new mommy\", but instead is a piece of berber carpet, which apparently is also his dinner. Carl's dad says that it's time to go to work at the insulation factory, and for Carl to put on his respirator and work boots. Suddenly, a huge robot stomps in the room and shoots lasers everywhere. Carl remembers eating carpet, but not the lasers and the robots. The ghost claims that the reason he doesn't remember is because it was only a prophecy, but in the future, the past has occurred. Carl reminds the robot that it's not Christmas at all, but in fact February. The robot leaves in a cloud of smoke, saying he'll be back in December, \"tomorrow\". When Carl tries to tell him to lock the door on his way out, the robot smashes through the door.\n\nMaster Shake shows up to tell Carl that his pool is full of blood, not that stuff what turns red when you pee in it, admitting he has had to pee in Carl's pool a number of times. Carl comments on how it looks like \"someone ran a heard of cows through a juicer or something\". Frylock determines it to be elfin blood. When Carl demands to know who had done this, the ghost arrives and informs them all that he is responsible for the blood. Frylock asks him why, and he goes into a long story, explaining how thousands of years ago, an ape named \"Sir Santa of Claus\" enslaved alien elves to make toys, then became lost during the Ice Age and built his house in the exact spot where Carl's house currently sits. Meatwad is frightened that the whole story is true, but Frylock assures him that it's not. The ghost changes his story, saying Santa is now a machine. Frylock reminds the ghost that he still hasn't explained the elf blood, and he says that it was due to an event called the \"great circuiting.\" He then goes back into another story, and talks all through the night, ending with an explanation of where babies come from--for machines. Everyone else has fallen asleep from boredom, and Carl has passed out drunk, but Meatwad is still engaged in conversation with the \"Ghost.\" When they awaken Frylock, they reveal the answer to the question he asked the Ghost hours before: the blood is in the pool because Carl's house was built on elf graves, and the ghost is haunting it because Carl desecrated the land because he lives there. The only way to end it is for Carl to give himself sexually to the \"Great Red Ape.\"\n\nCarl would much rather just move out, though, so he packs his boxes. He gets ready to take a shower to get ready for some potential buyers for his house, but ends up covered in elfin blood. He ends up showing the house to Glenn Danzig. He explains the features of the house and the shrieking robot that comes with it, and shows him the pool, still filled with blood. Danzig loves all this, since it perfectly fits his (famously) morbid taste. He asks for a price, and accepts Carl's offer of a million. After moving in, he runs sprinklers which spray blood all over the front yard and house, and comes over to the Aqua Teens' house, looking for the robot, which he says he cannot find. Shake says he hasn't seen him, but does show Danzig a \"haunted kitchen,\" which is Meatwad covered in a blanket with the lights flipping on and off, in an attempt to get Danzig to buy their house. Danzig gets angry and leaves, cursing at Shake that if he finds out the robot's in his house, that he will use Shake's skull as a bowl to eat his cereal out of. Meatwad tells the ghost to come out from the hallway. The ghost says that he is freaked out and annoyed by Danzig (\"He doesn't wear a shirt\"). Shake orders him to make their house bleed.\n\n'''Guest appearance''': [[Glenn Danzig]] as Danzig\n}}}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Home release==\n{{See also|Aqua Teen Hunger Force#Home releases|l1=List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force DVDs}}\nA sampler disc that was paired with Space Ghost Coast to Coast was given to less than 50,000 people at the 2003 [[San Diego Comic Con]] featuring the episode Mayhem of the Mooninites but it was labeled as just  Mooninites.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20090104152253/http://www.novirginsallowed.com/adultswim/reviews/dvdsampler_kon.html</ref>\nThe first sixteen episodes from season one were released on the ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Volume One'' [[DVD]] on November 18, 2003.
