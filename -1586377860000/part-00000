He was born in his mother's mansion on Avenue de Marigny, Paris. His father was [[Edward Sassoon|Sir Edward Albert Sassoon, 2nd Baronet]], MP, son of [[Albert Abdullah David Sassoon]]; his mother was [[Aline Caroline de Rothschild|Aline Caroline]], daughter of Gustave Samuel de Rothschild. His sister was [[Sybil Sassoon]], who married the [[Marquess of Cholmondeley]]. He was a cousin of the war poet [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. He was descended from the banking family of Frankfurt. When aged only nineteen years old his great-grandfather, [[James Rothschild]] was sent to Paris to set up the family business in France. James became wealthy. When he died in 1868 he was buried in [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]. His branch of the Sassoon-Rothschild family kept the Jewish faith, donated to Jewish charities and founded synagogues.\n\nHis great-grandfather [[David Sassoon]] had been imprisoned in Baghdad in 1828, and in 1832 he established his business [[David Sassoon & Co.]] at Bombay. He took advantage of British rule to return to Baghdad to trade. The family eventually established a Head Office at 12, Leadenhall Street, London and a company branch in Manchester. The Sassoons became assimilated Jews, dressing, acting and thinking like Englishmen. The Sassoon Brothers, David and Albert were friends of the Prince of Wales, built the 'Black Horse' brand. The business came with a baronetcy of Kensington Gore. His father bought Shorncliffe Lodge, where his cousin [[Mayer Rothschild]] was the MP. His father was not a successful backbencher, but the political influences had a profound effect on young Philip.\n\nHe was educated at Farnborough Prep school and [[Eton College|Eton]] before going up to Oxford. Old Etonian [[Arthur Balfour]] recommended the Debating Society to him. His father was also friendly with [[Frances Horner]], wife of [[John Francis Fortescue Horner|Sir John Horner]], a longtime friend of [[William Gladstone|Gladstone]] who lived at Mells Manor in Somerset. His house master was a member of the secret society of liberals, the [[Young Apostles]].  Also a near contemporary was [[Osbert Sitwell]], the Yorkshireman and author. A French scholar, he learned the language doing classes at Windsor Castle. Sassoon was taught aesthetics by [[Henry Luxmoore]] giving an insight into philosophy and social realism.  However he chose to read Modern History at [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. He was one of only 25 Jewish undergraduates, but was invited to join the [[Bullingdon Club]]. He joined the [[Royal East Kent Yeomanry|East Kent Yeomanry]] while still at Oxford and was commissioned as a second lieutenant.\n\nPhilip Sassoon entered Parliament in 1912.<ref name=\"London 1941\">{{cite book|title=Who Was Who 1929-1940|date=1941|publisher=A. & C.

A summary by ''[[The Guardian]]'' includes this comment:<ref name=\"theguardian1\">{{cite news|author=Richard Davenport-Hines |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/31/charmed-life-damian-collins-review |title=Charmed Life by Damian Collins review \u2013 the phenomenal world of Philip Sassoon |work=The Guardian |date=}}</ref><blockquote>Sassoon enjoyed witty gossip, but was never spiteful. He spoke with a clipped sibilant lisp, and liked to relax in a blue silk smoking jacket with slippers of zebra hide. He had fickle, moody fascinations with young men with whom he soon grew bored, but was loyally appreciative of female friends and kept an inner court of elderly, cultivated, ironical bachelors. His sexuality was central to his character and activities, but there is never any hint of sexual activity in the many memories of him. One hates to think that he was as sublimated as he sounds. His restlessness and fatalism, which were notorious among his friends, killed him at the age of 50 in 1939: although his physicians ordered bed rest after a viral infection, he hurtled about in unnecessary gaieties until his body was beyond recovery.</blockquote>\n\n==First World War==\nSassoon served as private secretary to Field Marshal Haig during the [[World War I|First World War]] from 1915\u20131918.<ref name=\"London 1941\"/> Sassoon was present at the meeting on the First of December 1914 at the [[Chateau Demont]] at [[Merville, Nord|Merville]] in France, when King [[George V]] and [[Edward VIII|Edward Prince of Wales]] met with [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9|Poincare]], President of France, and the Generals [[Joffre]], [[Ferdinand Foch|Foch]] and [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Rawlinson]]. The allies showed their determination to fight Germany and the Central Powers.  Because of his \"numerous social and political connections\" Sassoon, at that time a Second Lieutenant in the [[Royal East Kent Yeomanry]], was in attendance.  A square bronze [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] commemorating the occasion was auctioned in 2012.\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:Sir Philip Sassoon, 1923, Oil on canvas.jpg|thumb|Sir Philip Sassoon, [[John Singer Sargent]], 1923]]\n\nHe was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Hythe (UK Parliament constituency)|Hythe]] from 1912, succeeding his father, initially as the \"[[Baby of the House]]\". As an MP, he advocated aviation and bought his own aeroplane in 1919. In his role as undersecretary in the air ministry, he promoted civilian air travel.<ref name=\"theguardian1\"/>\n\nSassoon was [[Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister|Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[David Lloyd George]] in 1920. Between 1924 and 1929 and again from 1931 until 1937 he served as [[Under-Secretary of State for Air]], and gained much prominence in political circles. He was appointed a Privy Councillor in the [[1929 Dissolution Honours]]. In 1937 he became [[First Commissioner of Works]], a post which he held until his death, aged fifty, two years later.\n\nHe idolised the Prince of Wales, and supported the King during the abdication crisis of 1936. According to a review of the 2016 biography, \"he wanted international peace at any cost, and convinced himself that Hitler's promises were dependable.\"<ref name=\"theguardian1\"/>\n\n==Trent Park==\nHe had a reputation for being one of the greatest hosts in Britain. Although he owned a house at Park Lane, Sassoon arranged for [[Herbert Baker]] to design another home for him in 1912, Port Lympne in Kent. (Decades later, it became the [[Port Lympne Wild Animal Park]].) \"It was a unique building, Italianate and Moorish in its influence, built for a voluptuary of the senses who wanted his rooms to be a rapturous medley of strong, exotic colours and filled with the luscious fragrance of flowers. The formal grounds at Port Lympne were like a Hollywood version of Tuscany,\" according to a summary of his 2016 biography.<ref name=\"theguardian1\"/>\n\nHe also owned [[Trent Park]] and hired [[Philip Tilden]] to largely rebuild that mansion located in Cockfosters. Stylistic differences between the two houses illustrate changes in taste among members of British high society of the period. Trent Park possessed a landscape designed by [[Humphrey Repton]] but the existing house was Victorian and undistinguished. Sassoon had the Victorian additions demolished or altered, except for the west service wing, between 1926 and 1931. The projecting wings were added to the entrance (south) front. These modifications led to a large mansion in early Georgian-style.<ref>https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1000484, Trent Park Listing</ref> It became one of the houses of the age according to one report, \"a dream of another world \u2013 the white-coated footmen serving endless courses of rich but delicious food, the [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Duke of York]] coming in from golf...

The foundations of a large stone building were also found.

In fact, one reviewer of a 2016 bio about Sassoon describedit as a \"sybaritic mansion\".<ref name=\"theguardian1\"/> [[Mark Girouard]] has written of the \"quiet good taste expected of a country gentleman\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Girouard|first1=Mark|title=Life in the English Country House|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeinenglishcou0000giro|url-access=registration|date=1978|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven and London|isbn=978-0300022735}}</ref> against which Philip may have chafed in his younger years, apparently torn between the standards of ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]].

The Squadron was nicknamed \"The Millionaires\u2019 Squadron\" because it was reported to have six millionaire members. In 1932 he was enthusiastic about the new [[Percival Petrel]] monoplane and ordered his own model powered by a [[Napier & Son|Napier]] Javelin 111 six cylinder engine, with the interior finished in red leather. In this luxurious Gull G-ACGR he competed in the [[King\u2019s Cup]] and the [[Folkestone Aero Trophy Race]]. As Under-secretary of State for Air, Sassoon carried out the first general inspection of British overseas air stations, flying the [[Blackburn Iris]]. Afterwards he wrote [[The Third Route]], published by [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] in 1929, recounting the story of the development of the air route from England to India.\n\n==Honours and decorations==\n\nHe was appointed a Companion of St Michael and St George (C.M.G.) in 1917.<ref name=\"London 1941\"/> On 7 October 1919, it was announced that Sassoon had been awarded the [[France|French]] [[Croix de Guerre]] \"for distinguished services rendered during the course of [[World War I|the campaign]].<ref name=\"LG 3 October 1919\">{{London Gazette |issue=31586 |date=3 October 1919 |pages=12401\u201312405  |supp=y}}</ref> In 1923 he was made Knight of the Grand Cross Order of the British Empire (G.B.E.).<ref>Dictionary of National Biography, 1931-40, Oxford : Oxford University Press, 1949, p.784</ref>\n\nIn 2012 a set of his decorations was sold at auction.<ref>Spink, February 2005 Medal Newsletter</ref> The decorations were a set of the Order of The British Empire, Grand Cross (G.B.E.) made by the court-jeweller Garrard, the Order of St Michael and St George, Companion's (C.M.G.) neck Badge, also by Garrard, 1914\u201315 Star (engraved Lieut.

As a collector Philip Sassoon was, like many of the Rothschilds, drawn mainly to the English and French 18th century, but he also collected contemporary artists such as [[John Singer Sargent]] and [[William Orpen]].<ref>Agnews press release for An Exhibition of paintings and drawings from the collection of Philip and Sybil Sassoon</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nSassoon was said to have lived an openly homosexual life.<ref>{{cite news|author=Michael Bloch |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/16/double-lives-a-history-of-sex-and-secrecy-at-westminster |title=Double lives \u2013 a history of sex and secrecy at Westminster |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=7 July 2017}}</ref> According to a reviewer of a 2016 bio of Sassoon, \"his personal life was something that he shut away from the world\".

His sexuality was central to his character and activities, but there is never any hint of sexual activity in the many memories of him. One hates to think that he was as sublimated as he sounds. His restlessness and fatalism, which were notorious among his friends, killed him at the age of 50 in 1939: although his physicians ordered bed rest after a viral infection, he hurtled about in unnecessary gaieties until his body was beyond recovery.</blockquote>\n\n==First World War==\nSassoon served as private secretary to Field Marshal Haig during the [[World War I|First World War]] from 1915-1918.<ref name=\"London 1941\"/> Sassoon was present at the meeting on the First of December 1914 at the [[Chateau Demont]] at [[Merville, Nord|Merville]] in France, when King [[George V]] and [[Edward VIII|Edward Prince of Wales]] met with [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9|Poincare]], President of France, and the Generals [[Joffre]], [[Ferdinand Foch|Foch]] and [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Rawlinson]]. The allies showed their determination to fight Germany and the Central Powers.  Because of his \"numerous social and political connections\" Sassoon, at that time a Second Lieutenant in the [[Royal East Kent Yeomanry]], was in attendance.  A square bronze [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] commemorating the occasion was auctioned in 2012.\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:Sir Philip Sassoon, 1923, Oil on canvas.jpg|thumb|Sir Philip Sassoon, [[John Singer Sargent]], 1923]]\n\nHe was [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Hythe (UK Parliament constituency)|Hythe]] from 1912, succeeding his father, initially as the \"[[Baby of the House]]\". As an MP, he advocated aviation and bought his own aeroplane in 1919. In his role as undersecretary in the air ministry, he promoted civilian air travel.<ref name=\"theguardian1\"/>\n\nSassoon was [[Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister|Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to [[David Lloyd George]] in 1920. Between 1924 and 1929 and again from 1931 until 1937 he served as [[Under-Secretary of State for Air]], and gained much prominence in political circles. He was appointed a Privy Councillor in the [[1929 Dissolution Honours]]. In 1937 he became [[First Commissioner of Works]], a post which he held until his death, aged fifty, two years later.\n\nHe idolised the Prince of Wales, and supported the King during the abdication crisis of 1936. According to a review of the 2016 biography, \"he wanted international peace at any cost, and convinced himself that Hitler's promises were dependable.\"<ref name=\"theguardian1\"/>\n\n==Trent Park==\nHe had a reputation for being one of the greatest hosts in Britain. Although he owned a house at Park Lane, Sassoon arranged for [[Herbert Baker]] to design another home for him in 1912, Port Lympne in Kent. (Decades later, it became the [[Port Lympne Wild Animal Park]].) \"It was a unique building, Italianate and Moorish in its influence, built for a voluptuary of the senses who wanted his rooms to be a rapturous medley of strong, exotic colours and filled with the luscious fragrance of flowers. The formal grounds at Port Lympne were like a Hollywood version of Tuscany,\" according to a summary of his 2016 biography.<ref name=\"theguardian1\"/>\n\nHe also owned [[Trent Park]] and hired [[Philip Tilden]] to largely rebuild that mansion located in Cockfosters. Stylistic differences between the two houses illustrate changes in taste among members of British high society of the period. Trent Park possessed a landscape designed by [[Humphrey Repton]] but the existing house was Victorian and undistinguished. Sassoon had the Victorian additions demolished or altered, except for the west service wing, between 1926 and 1931. The projecting wings were added to the entrance (south) front. These modifications led to a large mansion in early Georgian-style.<ref>https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1000484, Trent Park Listing</ref> It became one of the houses of the age according to one report, \"a dream of another world \u2013 the white-coated footmen serving endless courses of rich but delicious food, the [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Duke of York]] coming in from golf...

The Squadron was nicknamed \"The Millionaires\u2019 Squadron\" because it was reported to have six millionaire members. In 1932 he was enthusiastic about the new [[Percival Petrel]] monoplane and ordered his own model powered by a [[Napier & Son|Napier]] Javelin 111 six cylinder engine, with the interior finished in red leather. In this luxurious Gull G-ACGR he competed in the [[King\u2019s Cup]] and the [[Folkestone Aero Trophy Race]]. As Under-secretary of State for Air, Sassoon carried out the first general inspection of British overseas air stations, flying the [[Blackburn Iris]]. Afterwards he wrote [[The Third Route]], published by [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] in 1929, recounting the story of the development of the air route from England to India.\n\n==Honours and decorations==\n\nHe was appointed a Companion of St Michael and St George (C.M.G.) in 1917.<ref name=\"London 1941\"/> On 7 October 1919, it was announced that Sassoon had been awarded the [[France|French]] [[Croix de Guerre]] \"for distinguished services rendered during the course of [[World War I|the campaign]].<ref name=\"LG 3 October 1919\">{{London Gazette |issue=31586 |date=3 October 1919 |pages=12401\u201312405  |supp=y}}</ref> In 1923 he was made Knight of the Grand Cross Order of the British Empire (G.B.E.).<ref>Dictionary of National Biography, 1931-40, Oxford : Oxford University Press, 1949, p.784</ref>\n\nIn 2012 a set of his decorations was sold at auction.<ref>Spink, February 2005 Medal Newsletter</ref> The decorations were a set of the Order of The British Empire, Grand Cross (G.B.E.) made by the court-jeweller Garrard, the Order of St Michael and St George, Companion's (C.M.G.) neck Badge, also by Garrard, 1914\u201315 Star (engraved Lieut.

Installation of signals intelligence equipment, at a cost of $1.5 million, was delayed to 1967 for budgetary reasons, resuming service as what is colloquially known as a \"[[spy ship]]\" and redesignated ''AGER-2'' on 13 May 1967.

At the same time, U.S. officials were concerned with conciliating the South Koreans, who expressed discontent about being left out of the negotiations. Richard A.

They anticipated that the North Koreans would try to exploit the situation to the ROK's disadvantage in every way possible, and they were rapidly growing distrustful of us and losing faith in their great ally. Of course, we had this other problem of how to ensure that the ROK would not retaliate for the [[Blue House Raid]] and to ease their growing feelings of insecurity.

If the answer to the particular proposal we presented wasn't in the cards, they would say something that was totally unresponsive and then go off and come back to the next meeting with an answer that was directed to the question. But there was rarely an immediate answer. That happened all through the negotiations. Their negotiators obviously were never empowered to act or speak on the basis of personal judgment or general instructions. They always had to defer a reply and presumably they went over it up in Pyongyang and passed it around and then decided on it.

It will set forth their point of view and require you to confess to everything they accuse you of ...

''Pueblo'' is one of only a few American ships to have been captured since the wars in [[First Barbary War|Tripoli]].\n\n=== Breach of U.S. communications security ===\nReverse engineering of communications devices on ''Pueblo'' allowed the North Koreans to share knowledge with the Soviet Union that led to the replication of those communications devices. This allowed the two nations access to the US Navy's communication systems until the US Navy revised those systems. The seizure of ''Pueblo'' followed soon after US Navy [[warrant officer]] [[John Anthony Walker]] introduced himself to Soviet authorities, setting up the Walker spy ring.  It has been argued that the seizure of ''Pueblo'' was executed specifically to capture the encryption devices aboard. Without them, it was difficult for the Soviets to make full use of Walker's information.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usspueblo.org/Aftermath/John_Walker_KW7.html |title=Crypto gear, John Walker and the History Channel |website=USS Pueblo Veteran's Association |access-date=30 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003075838/http://www.usspueblo.org/Aftermath/John_Walker_KW7.html |archive-date=3 October 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Heath, Laura J.

The crew itself thought the North Koreans would be able to rebuild much of the equipment. \n\nCryptographic equipment onboard at the time of capture included \u201cone [[KL-47]] for off-line encryption, two KW-7s<ref>[https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/usa/kw7/index.htm CryptoMuseum page on KW-7]</ref> for on-line encryption, three [[KWR-37]]s for receiving the Navy Operational Intelligence Broadcast, and four KG-14s<ref>[http://www.jproc.ca/crypto/kg14.html KG-14 information]</ref> which are used in conjunction with the KW-37 for receiving the Fleet Broadcasts.\u201d Additional tactical systems and [[one-time pad]]s were captured, but they were considered of little significance since most messages sent using them would be of value for only a short time. \n\nThe ship's cryptographic personnel were subject to intense interrogation by what they felt were highly knowledgable electronics experts. When crew members attempted to withhold details, they were later confronted with pages from captured manuals and told to correct their earlier accounts. The report concluded that the information gained from the interrogations saved the North Koreans three to six months of effort, but that they would have eventually understood everything from the captured equipment and accompanying technical manuals alone. The crew members were also asked about many U.S. cryptographic systems that were not onboard the ''Pueblo'', but only supplied superficial information. \n\nThe ''Pueblo'' carried [[key (cryptography)|key lists]] for January, February and March of 1968, but immediately after the ''Pueblo'' was captured, instructions were sent to other holders of those keys not to use them, so damage was limited. However it was discovered in the debriefing that the ''Pueblo'' had onboard superseded key lists for November and December 1967 which should have been destroyed by January 15, well before the ''Pueblo'' arrived on station, according to standing orders.<ref name=NSAEBB453/>{{rp|p. 19}} The report considered the capture of the superseded keys for November and December the most damaging cryptographic loss. The capture of these keys likely allowed North Korea and its allies to read more than 117,000 classified messages sent during those months.<ref name=NSAEBB453/>{{rp|p. 30}} The North Koreans would also have gained a thorough knowledge of the workings of the captured systems but that would only have been of use if additional key material was compromised in the future. The existence of the [[Walker spy ring]] was, of course, not known at the time of the report.\n\nThe report noted that \u201cthe North Koreans did not display any of the captured cryptographic material to the crew, except for some equipment diagrams, or otherwise publicize the material for propaganda purposes. When contrasted with the international publicity given to the capture of other highly classified Special Intelligence documents, the fact that this material was not displayed or publicized would indicate that they thoroughly understood its significance and the importance of concealing from the United States the details of the information they had acquired.\u201d<ref name=NSAEBB453/>{{rp|A.7}}\n\n=== In the communist camp ===\n\nDocuments released from [[National Archives of Romania]] suggest it was the Chinese rather than the Soviets who actively encouraged the reopening of hostilities in Korea during 1968, promising North Korea vast material support should hostilities in Korea resume.<ref name=\"wilsoncenter\"/> Together with Blue House Raid, the ''Pueblo'' incident turned out to be part of an increasing divergence between the Soviet leadership and North Korea. Fostering a resumption of hostilities in Korea, allegedly, was seen in Beijing as a way to mend relations between North Korea and China, and pull North Korea back in the Chinese sphere of influence in the context of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. After the (then secret) diplomatic efforts of the Soviets to have the American crew released fell on deaf ears in Pyongyang, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] publicly denounced North Korea's actions at the 8th plenary session of the [[23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"wilsoncenter\"/> In contrast, the Chinese (state controlled) press published declarations supportive of North Korea's actions in the ''Pueblo'' incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZBMCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT130|title=China and North Korea: Strategic and Policy Perspectives from a Changing China|first=C.|last=Freeman|date=30 June 2015|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books|access-date=5 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515040417/https://books.google.com/books?id=XZBMCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT130|archive-date=15 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Soviet archives reveal that the Soviet leadership was particularly displeased that North Korean leader Kim Il-sung had contradicted the assurances he previously gave Moscow that he would avoid a military escalation in Korea. Previously secret documents suggest the Soviets were surprised by the ''Pueblo'' incident, first learning of it in the press. The same documents reveal that the North Koreans also kept the Soviets completely in the dark regarding ongoing negotiations with the Americans for the crew's release, which was another bone of contention. The Soviet reluctance at a reopening of hostilities in Korea was partly motivated by the fact that they had a [[DPRK-Soviet Union Treaty of 1961|1961 treaty with North Korea that obliged them to intervene]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3005971-1961-Treaty-of-Friendship-Cooperation-and-Mutual.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201030920/https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3005971-1961-Treaty-of-Friendship-Cooperation-and-Mutual.html |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> in case the latter got attacked. Brezhnev however had made it clear in 1966 that just as in the case of the [[Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty|similar treaty they had with China]], the Soviets were prepared to ignore it rather than go to all-out war with the United States.<ref name=\"Radchenko\">{{cite web |url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/CWIHP_WP_47.pdf |first=Sergey S. |last=Radchenko |title=The Soviet Union and the North Korean Seizure of the USS Pueblo: Evidence from Russian Archives |work=Cold War International History Project |publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |location=Washington, D.C. |access-date=5 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307074400/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/CWIHP_WP_47.pdf |archive-date=7 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|12\u201315}}\n\nGiven that Chinese and North Korean archives surrounding the incident remain secret, Kim Il-sung's intentions cannot be known with certainty. The Soviets revealed however that Kim Il-sung sent a letter to [[Alexei Kosygin]] on 31 January 1968 demanding further military and economic aid, which was interpreted by the Soviets as the price they would have to pay to restrain Kim Il-sung's bellicosity. Consequently, Kim Il-sung was invited to Moscow, but he refused to go in person owing to \"increased defense preparations\" he had to attend to, sending instead his defense minister, [[Kim Ch'ang-bong]], who arrived on 26 February 1968. During a long meeting with Brezhnev, the Soviet leader made it clear that they were not willing to go to war with the United States, but agreed to an increase in subsidies for North Korea, which did happen in subsequent years.<ref name=\"Radchenko\"/>{{rp|15\u201318}}\n\n<center>{{Gallery\n|title=Aftermath: capture and repatriation\n|lines=6\n|width=200\n|height=150\n|File:Pueblo crew on 122368.jpg|''Pueblo's'' crew being released by the North Koreans across the [[Bridge of No Return]] in the [[Joint Security Area]] of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] (De-militarized Zone) in [[Panmunjom]], [[Korea]] on 23 December 1968.\n|Image:Repatriation of USS Pueblo Crew.jpg|Crew of USS ''Pueblo''<br /> upon release on 23 December 1968.\n|File:Pueblo group photo at Balboa Naval Hospital.jpg|Official Navy photograph of ''Pueblo's'' crew taken on the grounds of the [[Balboa Naval Hospital]] in San Diego shortly after their arrival.\n<!-- |Image:Pueblo a12 26 January 68 1.jpg|USS ''Pueblo'' in North Korean custody at Wonsan on 26 January 1968 (CIA [[Lockheed A-12|A-12]] imagery). -->\n}}</center>\n\n==Timeline of negotiations==\nWith Major General Pak Chung-kuk representing North Korea (DPRK) and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral John Victor Smith representing the [[United States]] until April 1968, at which point he is replaced by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Major General Gilbert H.

Initially, she was classified as a light cargo ship for basic refitting at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] during 1966. As ''Pueblo'' was prepared under a non-secret cover as a light cargo ship, the general crew staffing and training was on this basis, with 44% having never been to sea when first assigned. Installation of signals intelligence equipment, at a cost of $1.5 million, was delayed to 1967 for budgetary reasons, resuming service as what is colloquially known as a \"[[spy ship]]\" and redesignated ''AGER-2'' on 13 May 1967.

The North Korean vessel then ordered ''Pueblo'' to [[wikt:stand down|stand down]] or be fired upon. ''Pueblo'' attempted to maneuver away, but was considerably slower than the submarine chaser.

A fourth torpedo boat and a second submarine chaser appeared on the horizon a short time later.

At the same time, U.S. officials were concerned with conciliating the South Koreans, who expressed discontent about being left out of the negotiations. Richard A. Ericson, a political counselor for the American embassy in Seoul and operating officer for the ''Pueblo'' negotiations, notes in his oral history:\n\n<blockquote>The South Koreans were absolutely furious and suspicious of what we might do. They anticipated that the North Koreans would try to exploit the situation to the ROK's disadvantage in every way possible, and they were rapidly growing distrustful of us and losing faith in their great ally. Of course, we had this other problem of how to ensure that the ROK would not retaliate for the [[Blue House Raid]] and to ease their growing feelings of insecurity. They began to realize that the DMZ was porous and they wanted more equipment and aid. So, we were juggling a number of problems.<ref name=\"Richard A.

If the answer to the particular proposal we presented wasn't in the cards, they would say something that was totally unresponsive and then go off and come back to the next meeting with an answer that was directed to the question. But there was rarely an immediate answer. That happened all through the negotiations. Their negotiators obviously were never empowered to act or speak on the basis of personal judgment or general instructions. They always had to defer a reply and presumably they went over it up in Pyongyang and passed it around and then decided on it. Sometimes we would get totally nonsensical responses if they didn't have something in the card file that corresponded to the proposal at hand.<ref name=\"Richard A.

You are going to be asked to sign a document that the North Koreans will have drafted. They will brook no changes. It will set forth their point of view and require you to confess to everything they accuse you of ... If you allow them to, they will take as much time as they feel they need to squeeze every damn thing they can get out of this situation in terms of their propaganda goals, and they will try to exploit this situation to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the ROK.

In October 1999, she was towed from Wonsan on the east coast, around the Korean Peninsula, to the port of [[Nampo]] on the west coast. This required moving the vessel through international waters, and was undertaken just before the visit of U.S. presidential envoy [[James A. Kelly|James Kelly]] to the capital [[Pyongyang]]. After the stop at the Nampo shipyard ''Pueblo'' was relocated to Pyongyang and moored on the [[Taedong River]] near the spot that the [[General Sherman incident]] is believed to have taken place. In late 2012 ''Pueblo'' was moved again to the Botong River in Pyongyang next to a new addition to the [[Fatherland Liberation War Museum]].<ref name=\"usspueblo.org\"/>\n\nToday, ''Pueblo'' remains the second-oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy, behind {{USS|Constitution}} (\"Old Ironsides\"). ''Pueblo'' is one of only a few American ships to have been captured since the wars in [[First Barbary War|Tripoli]].\n\n=== Breach of U.S. communications security ===\nReverse engineering of communications devices on ''Pueblo'' allowed the North Koreans to share knowledge with the Soviet Union that led to the replication of those communications devices. This allowed the two nations access to the US Navy's communication systems until the US Navy revised those systems. The seizure of ''Pueblo'' followed soon after US Navy [[warrant officer]] [[John Anthony Walker]] introduced himself to Soviet authorities, setting up the Walker spy ring.  It has been argued that the seizure of ''Pueblo'' was executed specifically to capture the encryption devices aboard.

The crew itself thought the North Koreans would be able to rebuild much of the equipment. \n\nCryptographic equipment onboard at the time of capture included \u201cone [[KL-47]] for off-line encryption, two KW-7s<ref>[https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/usa/kw7/index.htm CryptoMuseum page on KW-7]</ref> for on-line encryption, three [[KWR-37]]s for receiving the Navy Operational Intelligence Broadcast, and four KG-14s<ref>[http://www.jproc.ca/crypto/kg14.html KG-14 information]</ref> which are used in conjunction with the KW-37 for receiving the Fleet Broadcasts.\u201d Additional tactical systems and [[one-time pad]]s were captured, but they were considered of little significance since most messages sent using them would be of value for only a short time. \n\nThe ship's cryptographic personnel were subject to intense interrogation by what they felt were highly knowledgable electronics experts. When crew members attempted to withhold details, they were later confronted with pages from captured manuals and told to correct their earlier accounts. The report concluded that the information gained from the interrogations saved the North Koreans three to six months of effort, but that they would have eventually understood everything from the captured equipment and accompanying technical manuals alone. The crew members were also asked about many U.S. cryptographic systems that were not onboard the Pueblo, but only supplied superficial information. \n\nThe ''Pueblo'' carried [[key (cryptography)|key lists]] for January, February and March of 1968, but immediately after the ''Pueblo'' was captured, instructions were sent to other holders of those keys not to use them, so damage was limited. However it was discovered in the debriefing that the Pueblo had onboard superseded key lists for November and December 1967 which should have been destroyed by January 15, well before the Pueblo arrived on station, according to standing orders.<ref name=NSAEBB453/>{{rp|p. 19}} The report considered the capture of the superseded keys for November and December the most damaging cryptographic loss. The capture of these keys likely allowed North Korea and its allies to read more than 117,000 classified messages sent during those months.<ref name=NSAEBB453/>{{rp|p. 30}} The North Koreans would also have gained a thorough knowledge of the workings of the captured systems but that would only have been of use if additional key material was compromised in the future. The existence of the [[Walker spy ring]] was, of course, not known at the time of the report.\n\nThe report noted that \u201cthe North Koreans did not display any of the captured cryptographic material to the crew, except for some equipment diagrams, or otherwise publicize the material for propaganda purposes. When contrasted with the international publicity given to the capture of other highly classified Special Intelligence documents, the fact that this material was not displayed or publicized would indicate that they thoroughly understood its significance and the importance of concealing \nfrom the United States the details of the information they had acquired.\u201d<ref name=NSAEBB453/>{{rp|A.7}}\n\n=== In the communist camp ===\n\nDocuments released from [[National Archives of Romania]] suggest it was the Chinese rather than the Soviets who actively encouraged the reopening of hostilities in Korea during 1968, promising North Korea vast material support should hostilities in Korea resume.<ref name=\"wilsoncenter\"/> Together with Blue House Raid, the ''Pueblo'' incident turned out to be part of an increasing divergence between the Soviet leadership and North Korea. Fostering a resumption of hostilities in Korea, allegedly, was seen in Beijing as a way to mend relations between North Korea and China, and pull North Korea back in the Chinese sphere of influence in the context of the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. After the (then secret) diplomatic efforts of the Soviets to have the American crew released fell on deaf ears in Pyongyang, [[Leonid Brezhnev]] publicly denounced North Korea's actions at the 8th plenary session of the [[23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].<ref name=\"wilsoncenter\"/> In contrast, the Chinese (state controlled) press published declarations supportive of North Korea's actions in the ''Pueblo'' incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZBMCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT130|title=China and North Korea: Strategic and Policy Perspectives from a Changing China|first=C.|last=Freeman|date=30 June 2015|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books|access-date=5 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515040417/https://books.google.com/books?id=XZBMCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT130|archive-date=15 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Soviet archives reveal that the Soviet leadership was particularly displeased that North Korean leader Kim Il-sung had contradicted the assurances he previously gave Moscow that he would avoid a military escalation in Korea. Previously secret documents suggest the Soviets were surprised by the ''Pueblo'' incident, first learning of it in the press. The same documents reveal that the North Koreans also kept the Soviets completely in the dark regarding ongoing negotiations with the Americans for the crew's release, which was another bone of contention.

The Soviets revealed however that Kim Il-sung sent a letter to [[Alexei Kosygin]] on 31 January 1968 demanding further military and economic aid, which was interpreted by the Soviets as the price they would have to pay to restrain Kim Il-sung's bellicosity. Consequently, Kim Il-sung was invited to Moscow, but he refused to go in person owing to \"increased defense preparations\" he had to attend to, sending instead his defense minister, [[Kim Ch'ang-bong]], who arrived on 26 February 1968. During a long meeting with Brezhnev, the Soviet leader made it clear that they were not willing to go to war with the United States, but agreed to an increase in subsidies for North Korea, which did happen in subsequent years.<ref name=\"Radchenko\"/>{{rp|15\u201318}}\n\n<center>{{Gallery\n|title=Aftermath: capture and repatriation\n|lines=6\n|width=200\n|height=150\n|File:Pueblo crew on 122368.jpg|''Pueblo's'' crew being released by the North Koreans across the [[Bridge of No Return]] in the [[Joint Security Area]] of the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|DMZ]] (De-militarized Zone) in [[Panmunjom]], [[Korea]] on 23 December 1968.\n|Image:Repatriation of USS Pueblo Crew.jpg|Crew of USS ''Pueblo''<br /> upon release on 23 December 1968.\n|File:Pueblo group photo at Balboa Naval Hospital.jpg|Official Navy photograph of ''Pueblo's'' crew taken on the grounds of the [[Balboa Naval Hospital]] in San Diego shortly after their arrival.\n<!-- |Image:Pueblo a12 26 January 68 1.jpg|USS ''Pueblo'' in North Korean custody at Wonsan on 26 January 1968 (CIA [[Lockheed A-12|A-12]] imagery). -->\n}}</center>\n\n==Timeline of negotiations==\nWith Major General Pak Chung-kuk representing North Korea (DPRK) and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral John Victor Smith representing the [[United States]] until April 1968, at which point he is replaced by [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Major General Gilbert H.

The screenplay, written by [[Karen McCullah|Karen McCullah Lutz]] and [[Kirsten Smith (writer)|Kirsten Smith]], is a modernization of [[William Shakespeare]]'s late-16th-century comedy ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', retold in a late-1990s American [[high school]] setting. In the story, new student Cameron (Gordon-Levitt) is smitten with Bianca (Oleynik) and, in order to get around her father's strict rules on [[dating]], attempts to get [[bad boy (archetype)|bad boy]] Patrick (Ledger) to date Bianca's ill-tempered sister, Kat (Stiles). The film is titled after a poem written by Kat about her bittersweet romance with Patrick. Much of the filming took place in the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], with many scenes shot at [[Stadium High School]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]].\n\nReleased March 31, 1999, ''10 Things I Hate About You'' was number two at the domestic box office during its opening weekend, behind only ''[[The Matrix]]'', and was a moderate financial and critical success. It was a [[breakthrough role]] for Stiles, Ledger, and Gordon-Levitt, all of whom were nominated for various teen-oriented awards. Ten years later, the film was adapted into a [[10 Things I Hate About You (TV series)|television series of the same title]], which ran for twenty episodes and featured [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] reprising his role as Walter Stratford from the film.\n\n==Plot==\nCameron James, a new nerdy student at Padua High School in the [[Seattle]] area, becomes instantly smitten with popular [[sophomore]] Bianca Stratford. He makes friends with [[Geek]]y Michael Eckman warns him that Bianca is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective father does not allow Bianca or her older sister, the [[shrew (stock character)|shrew]]ish Kat, to date. Kat, a [[senior (education)|senior]], is accepted to [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], but her father, Walter, wants her to stay close to home. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter, an [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] worrisome of [[teenage pregnancy]], will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this unlikely.\n\nWhen Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and, as a pretense for allowing her to date Joey, suggests that Cameron find someone willing to date Kat. Michael and Cameron selects \"bad boy\" Patrick Verona, but Patrick scares him off. Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take out Kat, under the pretense that this will allow Joey to date Bianca. Patrick agrees to the deal, but Kat rebuffs his first few advances. Michael and Cameron help him by prying Bianca for information on Kat's likes and dislikes. Armed with this knowledge, Patrick begins to win Kat's interest. She goes to a party with him, which enables Bianca to go as well, much to Walter's dismay.\n\nAt the party, Kat becomes upset when she sees Bianca with Joey, and responds by getting drunk. Patrick attends to her, and Kat starts to open up, expressing her interest in starting a [[musical ensemble|band]]. However, when she tries to kiss him, Patrick pulls away and Kat leaves, infuriated. Meanwhile, Bianca ignores Cameron in favor of Joey, leaving Cameron dejected. Bianca soon realizes, however, that Joey is shallow and self-absorbed, and asks Cameron for a ride home. Cameron admits his feelings for her and his frustration with how she has treated him. Bianca responds by kissing him.\n\nJoey offers to pay Patrick to take Kat to the [[prom]] so he can take Bianca. Patrick initially refuses, but relents when Joey offers him more money. Kat is still angry with Patrick, but he wins her over by serenading her with the accompaniment of the [[marching band]], and she helps him sneak out of detention. They go on a date which turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious and angry when Patrick insists that she go with him to the prom, an event she is adamantly against. Bianca is irritated that Cameron hasn't asked her to the prom, and so accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter won't allow it unless Kat goes too. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were [[freshman|freshmen]] and, succumbing to [[peer pressure]], had sex with him. Afterward she regretted it and Joey dumped her, so she vowed to never again do anything just because everyone else was doing it. Bianca insists that she can make her own choices, so Kat agrees to go to the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey.\n\nAll is going well at the prom until Bianca learns that Joey planned to have sex with her that night. Angry that Bianca has spurned him for Cameron, Joey reveals his arrangement with Patrick, which causes Kat to leave heartbroken. Joey then punches Cameron, but is in turn beaten up by Bianca for having hurt her, Kat, and Cameron. Bianca and Cameron share another kiss.\n\nThe next day, Bianca reconciles with Kat and begins dating Cameron. Walter admits that Kat is capable of taking care of herself, and gives her permission to attend Sarah Lawrence College. For an assignment in which the students were required to write their own version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Sonnet 141]], Kat reads aloud a poem titled \"10 Things I Hate About You\", revealing that she still loves Patrick. Patrick surprises her with a guitar bought with the money that Joey paid him, and confesses that he has fallen for her. Kat forgives him, and the two reconcile with a kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Katarina \"Kat\" Stratford, the antisocial, [[shrew (stock character)|shrew]]ish elder Stratford sister.\n* [[Heath Ledger]] as Patrick Verona, the \"[[bad boy (archetype)|bad boy]]\" who is hired to date Kat from Cameron and Michael who he made friends with and falls for her in the process.\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Cameron James, the new nerdy student at Padua High School who is smitten with Bianca and goes to great lengths to win her favor.

The screenplay, written by [[Karen McCullah|Karen McCullah Lutz]] and [[Kirsten Smith (writer)|Kirsten Smith]], is a modernization of [[William Shakespeare]]'s late-16th-century comedy ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', retold in a late-1990s American [[high school]] setting. In the story, new student Cameron (Gordon-Levitt) is smitten with Bianca (Oleynik) and, in order to get around her father's strict rules on [[dating]], attempts to get [[bad boy (archetype)|bad boy]] Patrick (Ledger) to date Bianca's ill-tempered sister, Kat (Stiles). The film is titled after a poem written by Kat about her bittersweet romance with Patrick. Much of the filming took place in the [[Seattle metropolitan area]], with many scenes shot at [[Stadium High School]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]].\n\nReleased March 31, 1999, ''10 Things I Hate About You'' was number two at the domestic box office during its opening weekend, behind only ''[[The Matrix]]'', and was a moderate financial and critical success. It was a [[breakthrough role]] for Stiles, Ledger, and Gordon-Levitt, all of whom were nominated for various teen-oriented awards. Ten years later, the film was adapted into a [[10 Things I Hate About You (TV series)|television series of the same title]], which ran for twenty episodes and featured [[Larry Miller (comedian)|Larry Miller]] reprising his role as Walter Stratford from the film.\n\n==Plot==\nCameron James, a new nerdy student at Padua High School in the [[Seattle]] area, becomes instantly smitten with popular [[sophomore]] Bianca Stratford. He makes friends with [[Geek]]y Michael Eckman warns him that Bianca is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective father does not allow Bianca or her older sister, the [[shrew (stock character)|shrew]]ish Kat, to date. Kat, a [[senior (education)|senior]], is accepted to [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], but her father, Walter, wants her to stay close to home. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter, an [[obstetrics|obstetrician]] worrisome of [[teenage pregnancy]], will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this unlikely.\n\nWhen Cameron asks Bianca out, she informs him of her father's new rule and, as a pretense for allowing her to date Joey, suggests that Cameron find someone willing to date Kat. Michael and Cameron selects \"bad boy\" Patrick Verona, but Patrick scares him off. Michael assists by convincing Joey to pay Patrick to take out Kat, under the pretense that this will allow Joey to date Bianca. Patrick agrees to the deal, but Kat rebuffs his first few advances. Michael and Cameron help him by prying Bianca for information on Kat's likes and dislikes. Armed with this knowledge, Patrick begins to win Kat's interest. She goes to a party with him, which enables Bianca to go as well, much to Walter's dismay.\n\nAt the party, Kat becomes upset when she sees Bianca with Joey, and responds by getting drunk. Patrick attends to her, and Kat starts to open up, expressing her interest in starting a [[musical ensemble|band]]. However, when she tries to kiss him, Patrick pulls away and Kat leaves, infuriated. Meanwhile, Bianca ignores Cameron in favor of Joey, leaving Cameron dejected. Bianca soon realizes, however, that Joey is shallow and self-absorbed, and asks Cameron for a ride home. Cameron admits his feelings for her and his frustration with how she has treated him. Bianca responds by kissing him.\n\nJoey offers to pay Patrick to take Kat to the [[prom]] so he can take Bianca. Patrick initially refuses, but relents when Joey offers him more money. Kat is still angry with Patrick, but he wins her over by serenading her with the accompaniment of the [[marching band]], and she helps him sneak out of detention. They go on a date which turns romantic, but Kat becomes suspicious and angry when Patrick insists that she go with him to the prom, an event she is adamantly against. Bianca is irritated that Cameron hasn't asked her to the prom, and so accepts Joey's invitation, but Walter won't allow it unless Kat goes too. Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were [[freshman|freshmen]] and, succumbing to [[peer pressure]], had sex with him. Afterward she regretted it and Joey dumped her, so she vowed to never again do anything just because everyone else was doing it. Bianca insists that she can make her own choices, so Kat agrees to go to the prom with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey.\n\nAll is going well at the prom until Bianca learns that Joey planned to have sex with her that night. Angry that Bianca has spurned him for Cameron, Joey reveals his arrangement with Patrick, which causes Kat to leave heartbroken. Joey then punches Cameron, but is in turn beaten up by Bianca for having hurt her, Kat, and Cameron. Bianca and Cameron share another kiss.\n\nThe next day, Bianca reconciles with Kat and begins dating Cameron. Walter admits that Kat is capable of taking care of herself, and gives her permission to attend Sarah Lawrence College. For an assignment in which the students were required to write their own version of [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Sonnet 141]], Kat reads aloud a poem titled \"10 Things I Hate About You\", revealing that she still loves Patrick. Patrick surprises her with a guitar bought with the money that Joey paid him, and confesses that he has fallen for her. Kat forgives him, and the two reconcile with a kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Stiles]] as Katarina \"Kat\" Stratford, the antisocial, [[shrew (stock character)|shrew]]ish elder Stratford sister.\n* [[Heath Ledger]] as Patrick Verona, the \"[[bad boy (archetype)|bad boy]]\" who is hired to date Kat from Cameron and Michael who he made friends with and falls for her in the process.\n* [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] as Cameron James, the new nerdy student at Padua High School who is smitten with Bianca and goes to great lengths to win her favor.

Petrino ILR 424.jpg|thumb|Dimitrie Petrino (posthumous portrait, 1891)]]\n'''Dimitrie Petrino''' (1838 (?)&mdash;April 29, 1878) was a [[Bessarabia]]n-born [[Romania]]n poet.\n\nBorn in [[B\u00eerl\u0103deni|Rujni\u021ba]], a village in the [[Bessarabia Governorate]]'s [[Soroca County (Romania)|Soroca County]] within the [[Russian Empire]], his parents were Petre Petrino, a rural landowner, and his wife Eufrosina (''n\u00e9e'' Hurmuzachi). He studied at home under the guidance of a Nicolae Sbierea and perhaps of his uncles the [[Hurmuzachi brothers]]. As a young man, he travelled to Italy, Austria and Germany, adopting somewhat of a literary culture, albeit not in organized fashion.

He was also a keen [[Sportsperson|sportsman]] who excelled at [[cricket]] and [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechasing]].\n\n==Early days==\nSir Wilfrid Lawson, the son of [[Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet, of Brayton]] and his wife Mary Pocklington-Stenhouse, daughter of Joseph Pocklington-Stenhouse, was born at [[Brayton Hall, Cumberland|Brayton Hall]], [[Aspatria]], [[Cumberland]] on 21 October 1862. Since the family preferred a simple sporting life, they encouraged their children to enjoy a string of outdoor pursuits, including [[fishing]], [[shooting]], [[ice skating]], [[cricket]] and the family obsession, [[foxhunting]]. He began his education at home. In 1873, he attended the Reverend W. Rickmore's school at [[Kenilworth]]. In 1875, he progressed to [[Wixenford School]], run by [[Cowley Powles]] in [[Hampshire]]. In 1877 he began a four-year stay at [[Harrow School]], where he was a member of Vanity House. At Harrow he developed into a distinguished scholar and athlete, becoming a valuable member of the cricket and [[Association football|football]] eleven. He left Harrow in 1881 and entered [[Trinity College, Oxford]] where again he displayed his scholastic and athletic abilities, becoming a very good [[polo]] player. He gained his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA degree]] in 1888.<ref name=\"Brayton Blossoms 1892\">Brayton Blossoms (1892), Arthur Lawson</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\nOn 28 April 1891, Lawson married Miss [[Mary Camilla Lawson|Mary Camilla Macan]], fourth daughter of Turner A Macan of [[Elstow]] [[Bedfordshire]] and Cariff [[County Armagh]]. They [[honeymoon]]ed in [[Australia]] and then resided at [[Isel Hall, Cumberland]]. Their marriage did not produce children.<ref>West Cumberland Times, 2 May 1891</ref>\n\n===Travelling===\n\nLawson became a great traveller. During the years 1883-7 he visited [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]]. In 1888, he travelled the length of the [[United States]] and returned through [[Canada]]. During the spring and summer of 1889, accompanied by his brother Arthur, he travelled in [[Greece]] and then visited [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]); before continuing through [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], the [[Black Sea]], [[Danubian Principalities|Danube Principalities]], the [[Crimea]] and [[Russia]]; where they visited both [[Moscow]] and [[St. Petersburg]]. In 1890, he took a voyage to [[Mumbai|Bombay]], [[India]], calling at [[Cairo]] on his return. He recorded many of these travelogues in the pages of the Carlisle Journal.<ref name=\"Brayton Blossoms 1892\"/>\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:The Brayton Blazers.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Brayton Blazers Foxhounds]]\nLawson began his political apprenticeship, standing on the platform supporting his father. Like his father he was a committed [[Teetotalism|teetotaller]] and an extreme [[Radicals (UK)|radical]]. He also possessed the same gift of making very witty and appropriate speeches on a wide range of related subjects, which he enlivened with spicy tales and racy anecdotes. His political and temperance speeches always dealt with contemporary topics in a common sense and rational manner. In 1885, when his father was in serious ill health, recuperating in the [[Southern France|South of France]], Lawson acted as his father's understudy in the [[general election]] for the [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth division]]. Although he acquitted himself and rendered useful service, his father lost the election by a mere ten votes.<ref>West Cumberland Times, 6 December 1885</ref> In July 1886, Lawson stood as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] candidate for the parliamentary division of [[Penrith (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid- Cumberland]] but was defeated by [[James Lowther, 1st Viscount Ullswater|James Lowther]], the Tory candidate, who gained a majority of 644 votes. From 1886\u20139, he acted as chairman of the [[Aspatria]] [[School boards in England and Wales|School Board]].

He had two opponents, the sitting [[Tory|Conservative]] member Sir [[John Randles]] and a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] candidate named Whitehead. However, with a split [[working class]] vote Lawson finished second.

Part of his speech stated:-\n::If it were not true it would seem incredible that in a few short days we should be intervening in the affairs of and being asked for a Vote of Credit for a war in [[Europe]] with which we have no direct concern.

He was also a keen [[Sportsperson|sportsman]] who excelled at [[cricket]] and [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechasing]].\n\n==Early days==\nSir Wilfrid Lawson, the son of [[Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet, of Brayton]] and his wife Mary Pocklington-Stenhouse, daughter of Joseph Pocklington-Stenhouse, was born at [[Brayton Hall, Cumberland|Brayton Hall]], [[Aspatria]], [[Cumberland]] on 21 October 1862. Since the family preferred a simple sporting life, they encouraged their children to enjoy a string of outdoor pursuits, including [[fishing]], [[shooting]], [[ice skating]], [[cricket]] and the family obsession, [[foxhunting]]. He began his education at home. In 1873, he attended the Reverend W. Rickmore\u2019s school at [[Kenilworth]]. In 1875, he progressed to [[Wixenford School]], run by [[Cowley Powles]] in [[Hampshire]]. In 1877 he began a four-year stay at [[Harrow School]], where he was a member of Vanity House. At Harrow he developed into a distinguished scholar and athlete, becoming a valuable member of the cricket and [[Association football|football]] eleven. He left Harrow in 1881 and entered [[Trinity College, Oxford]] where again he displayed his scholastic and athletic abilities, becoming a very good [[polo]] player. He gained his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA degree]] in 1888.<ref name=\"Brayton Blossoms 1892\">Brayton Blossoms (1892), Arthur Lawson</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\nOn 28 April 1891, Lawson married Miss [[Mary Camilla Lawson|Mary Camilla Macan]], fourth daughter of Turner A Macan of [[Elstow]] [[Bedfordshire]] and Cariff [[County Armagh]]. They [[honeymoon]]ed in [[Australia]] and then resided at [[Isel Hall, Cumberland]]. Their marriage did not produce children.<ref>West Cumberland Times, 2 May 1891</ref>\n\n===Travelling===\n\nLawson became a great traveller. During the years 1883-7 he visited [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]]. In 1888, he travelled the length of the [[United States]] and returned through [[Canada]]. During the spring and summer of 1889, accompanied by his brother Arthur, he travelled in [[Greece]] and then visited [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]); before continuing through [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], the [[Black Sea]], [[Danubian Principalities|Danube Principalities]], the [[Crimea]] and [[Russia]]; where they visited both [[Moscow]] and [[St. Petersburg]]. In 1890, he took a voyage to [[Mumbai|Bombay]], [[India]], calling at [[Cairo]] on his return. He recorded many of these travelogues in the pages of the Carlisle Journal.<ref name=\"Brayton Blossoms 1892\"/>\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:The Brayton Blazers.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Brayton Blazers Foxhounds]]\nLawson began his political apprenticeship, standing on the platform supporting his father. Like his father he was a committed [[Teetotalism|teetotaller]] and an extreme [[Radicals (UK)|radical]]. He also possessed the same gift of making very witty and appropriate speeches on a wide range of related subjects, which he enlivened with spicy tales and racy anecdotes. His political and temperance speeches always dealt with contemporary topics in a common sense and rational manner. In 1885, when his father was in serious ill health, recuperating in the [[Southern France|South of France]], Lawson acted as his father\u2019s understudy in the [[general election]] for the [[Cockermouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Cockermouth division]].
