The first [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of Orpington, Hugh de Mortimer, held court here in 1270. The house was rebuilt in 1290, this time in stone, and extended in 1393 and 1471. In the 17th century the house ceased to be a rectory and passed into private ownership; a timber-framed extension was added, which no longer exists.

It originally accommodated 1,050 patients; an extra wing was added in 1917. By January 1919, more than 15,000 wounded soldiers had been treated here. Most of the original pre-fabricated buildings remained in use for more than 80 years before a major renovation around the turn of the century. Today [[Orpington Hospital]] provides [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] and [[therapy]] services, [[outpatient]] and [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] services (including [[dermatology]] and [[diabetes]]), but it no longer has an [[Accident and Emergency]] Unit.

Canadian Corner is unique of other memorials in that its design resembles that of First World War Cemeteries found in France & Belgium with the text on the memorial suggesting the Memorial Cross to be the first outside of the Western Front as the English public were interested in how the war cemeteries looked. The Memorial Cross in Canadian Corner was unveiled in 1921 in the presence of the High Commissioner for Canada.

The parish church also pre-dates the [[Domesday Book]].

In 1032, Eadsy, chaplain to King [[Canute the Great|Cnut]], gave his estate at Orpedingetune to Christ Church Priory, [[Canterbury]]. The first [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of Orpington, Hugh de Mortimer, held court here in 1270. The house was rebuilt in 1290, this time in stone, and extended in 1393 and 1471. In the 17th century the house ceased to be a rectory and passed into private ownership; a timber-framed extension was added, which no longer exists. The house was acquired by [[Orpington Urban District]] [[Local government in the United Kingdom|Council]] in 1947, and used to house a museum, closed in September 2015 after more than 50 years for cost reasons.\n\n=== Priory Gardens ===\n[[File:The Priory Garden, Orpington.JPG|thumb|right|The Priory Garden at Orpington]]\n\nThe Grade II listed<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1001444|title=Priory Gardens, Orpington, Bromley - 1001444  Historic England|website=historicengland.org.uk|access-date=2017-08-21}}</ref> Priory Gardens designed by the last private owners of The Priory, Cecil and Lilian Hughes, consists of Italianate and Arts & Crafts style formal gardens reflecting the Hughes respective interests, a landscaped park with children's play area, and a trio of natural ponds where the [[River Cray]] rises. Each year the Orpington [[May Queen]] is crowned in the gardens.\n\n===Orpington Hospital===\nDuring the First World War a large military hospital, the \"16th Canadian General\", was built south-east of the station, funded by the government of [[Ontario]], Canada. It originally accommodated 1,050 patients; an extra wing was added in 1917. By January 1919, more than 15,000 wounded soldiers had been treated here. Most of the original pre-fabricated buildings remained in use for more than 80 years before a major renovation around the turn of the century. Today [[Orpington Hospital]] provides [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] and [[therapy]] services, [[outpatient]] and [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] services (including [[dermatology]] and [[diabetes]]), but it no longer has an [[Accident and Emergency]] Unit. The nearest A&E is [[Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup]], or [[Princess Royal University Hospital]], [[Farnborough, London|Farnborough]].\n\n===Orpington War Memorial===\nOrpington War Memorial standing at the end of the Highstreet is a focal point for Remembrance Sunday.<ref name=\"newsshopper3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/13952166.Remembrance_Sunday_services_in_Bromley_borough_2015__Where_to_find_them/|publisher=newsshopper.co.uk|title=Remembrance Sunday services in Bromley borough 2015: Where to find them (From News Shopper)|accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nIt was designed by local architect Charles Heaton Comyn and unveiled on Sunday 28 August 1921.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Orpington War Memorial|author=Pateman, J.|date=2012|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781471082832|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XPSSAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA3|page=3|accessdate=13 January 2017}}{{self-published source}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} It originally contained the names of 111 local men who died in the Great War, however further names were added later, bringing the total for the Great War up to 117.\n\nA campaign in 1997\u201398 for the remembrance of 432 armed forces personnel who fell in the Second World War resulted in the unveiling of eight more plaques on Sunday 2 August 1999.<ref name=\"google\"/>\n\nAnother new plaque has been added detailing the eight local men who have died on active duty since 1945.<ref name=\"google\"/>\n\n===Canadian Corner===\n[[File:Canadian Corner.jpg|thumb|The Memorial Cross which stands in Canadian Corner]]\nIn the corner of All Saints' Church sits Canadian Corner. This is a First World War memorial which marks where 182 soldiers who died being treated at Orpington Hospital are buried. The name derives from the fact 88 of those buried\nare Canadians. Canadian Corner is unique of other memorials in that its design resembles that of First World War Cemeteries found in France & Belgium with the text on the memorial suggesting the Memorial Cross to be the first outside of the Western Front as the English public were interested in how the war cemeteries looked. The Memorial Cross in Canadian Corner was unveiled in 1921 in the presence of the High Commissioner for Canada. The automatic plunger used to release the Union flag which hid the Cross was the same used by [[King George the Fifth]] during the unveiling of [[The Cenotaph, Whitehall|The Cenotaph]] a year earlier. The Memorial Cross in Canadian Corner was the first Canadian Memorial unveiled in the UK.<ref name=\"wordpress\">{{cite web|url=https://allsaintsorpington.wordpress.com/about/churchyard/canadian-corner/|publisher=allsaintsorpington.wordpress.com|title=Canadian Corner &#124; All Saints&#039; Church Orpington|accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Orpington chicken and duck==\n{{Main|Orpington (chicken)|Buff Duck}}\nOrpington is known for the \"Buff\", \"Black\" and \"Speckled\" [[Orpington (chicken)|chicken]]s bred locally by William Cook in the 1890s.

Another peculiarity of the line was that it was the only one in the suburban railway service not to run along the [[Milan Passante railway|Passante railway]].\n \nInitially, the S9 was managed by [[Treni Regionali Ticino Lombardia|TiLo]], a company formed ad hoc by [[Trenitalia]] and the [[Swiss Federal Railways]].

the [[Milan suburban railway service]] ({{lang-it|Servizio ferroviario suburbano di Milano}}), which converges on the city of [[Milan]], [[Italy]].<ref name=scs/>\n\nIt uses the [[Saronno\u2013Seregno railway|Saronno\u2013Seregno]], [[Milan\u2013Chiasso railway|Milan\u2013Chiasso]], [[Milan belt railway|Milan belt]], [[Milan southern belt railway|Milan southern belt]] and [[Mortara\u2013Milan

station|Albairate-Vermezzo]]\n\nLine S9, a [[cross-city route]], initially heads in an southeasterly direction from [[Saronno railway station|Saronno]] towards [[Cesano Maderno railway station|Cesano Maderno]], [[Seregno railway station|Seregno]], [[Monza railway station|Monza]] and [[Milano Greco Pirelli railway station|Milano Greco Pirelli]], then runs via the Milan belt line and southern belt line around the eastern and southern sides of the Milan city centre, before finally heading southwest, to [[Albairate-Vermezzo railway station|Albairate-Vermezzo]].<ref name=linee/>\n\n==History==\nThe S9 commenced operation on 24 December 2004, and initially linked Seregno with [[Milano San Cristoforo railway station|Milano San Cristoforo]]. Unlike the other lines in the suburban railway service, which offered services at half-hourly intervals, the S9 ran at a frequency of only one train per hour, in a narrower time band (from 07:00 to 20:00).<ref name=canale/>\n \nThanks to the activation of the S9, local passenger trains returned to the southern belt line after an absence of 10 years.  Another peculiarity of the line was that it was the only one in the suburban railway service not to run along the [[Milan Passante railway|Passante railway]].\n \nInitially, the S9 was managed by [[Treni Regionali Ticino Lombardia|TiLo]], a company formed ad hoc by [[Trenitalia]] and the [[Swiss Federal Railways]]. In March 2008, Trenitalia became the sole operator.  Upon the timetable change on 13 December 2009, train services on the line became half-hourly throughout the day.<ref name=lsic/>\n \nIn May 2009, following the merger of the Trenitalia's Regional Passenger Division with [[LeNORD]], management of the line was taken over by the merged entity, Trenord.\n \nOn 12 June 2011, the line was extended from Milano San Cristoforo to Albairate-Vermezzo.\n\nOn 9 December 2012, the line was extended from Seregno to Saronno.\n\n== Stations ==\nThe stations on the S9 are as follows (the stations with blue background are in the municipality of Milan):<ref name=ls9/>\n\n{| style=\"text-align:left;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=#D8D8DF \n!

Compared to composites reinforced with [[glass fiber]]s, composites with natural fibers have advantages such as lower density, better thermal insulation, and reduced skin irritation. Further, unlike glass fibers, natural fibers can be broken down by bacteria once they are no longer in use.\n\nNatural fibers are good sweat absorbents and can be found in a variety of textures. Cotton fibers made from the cotton plant, for example, produce fabrics that are light in weight, soft in texture, and which can be made in various sizes and colors. Clothes made of natural fibers such as cotton are often preferred over clothing made of [[synthetic fiber]]s by people living in hot and humid climates.\n\n=== Plant fibers ===\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n!Category\n!Description\n|-\n|[[Seed fiber]]\n|The fibers collected from the seeds of various plants are known as seed fibers.\n|-\n|[[Leaf fiber]]\n|Fibers collected from the cells of a leaf are known as leaf fibers, for example, banana,<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Fuqua|first=Michael A.|last2=Huo|first2=Shanshan|last3=Ulven|first3=Chad A.|date=2012-07-01|title=Natural Fiber Reinforced Composites|journal=Polymer Reviews|volume=52|issue=3|pages=259\u2013320|doi=10.1080/15583724.2012.705409|issn=1558-3724}}</ref> pineapple (PALF),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Todkar |first1=Santosh |title= Review on mechanical properties evaluation of pineapple leaf fibre (PALF) reinforced polymer composites |doi=10.1016/j.compositesb.2019.106927 |journal= Composites Part B |date=2019-10-01 |volume=174 |pages=106927 |issn=1359-8368}}</ref> etc.\n|-\n|[[Bast fiber]]\n|Bast fibers are collected from the outer cell layers of the plant's stem.

Collagen has a hierarchical structure, forming triple helices, [[fibril]]s, and fibers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Keratin ===\n{{Main|Keratin}}\n[[File:Alpha Keratin Basic Structure.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the creation of alpha keratins helical structure.]]\nKeratin is a structural protein located at the hard surfaces in many vertebrates. Keratin has two forms, [[\u03b1-keratin]] and [[\u03b2-keratin]], that are found in different classes of chordates. The naming convention for these keratins follows that for protein structures: [[alpha helix|alpha]] keratin is [[helix|helical]] and [[beta sheet|beta]] keratin is sheet-like. Alpha keratin is found in [[mammal]]ian hair, skin, nails, horn and quills, while beta keratin can be found in [[bird|avian]] and [[reptile|reptilian]] species in scales, [[feather]]s, and beaks. The two different structures of keratin have dissimilar mechanical properties, as seen in their dissimilar applications. The relative alignment of the keratin fibrils has a significant impact on the mechanical properties. In human hair the filaments of alpha keratin are highly aligned, giving a tensile strength of approximately 200MPa. This tensile strength is an order of magnitude higher than human nails (20MPa), because human hair\u2019s keratin filaments are more aligned.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Properties ==\nCompared to synthetic fibers, natural fibers tend have decreased stiffness and strength.<ref name=\":2\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Tensile Mechanical Properties of Natural Fibers<ref name=\":2\" />\n!Material\n!Fiber\n!Elastic Modulus (GPa)\n!Strength (MPa)\n|-\n|Tendon\n|Collagen\n|1.50\n|150\n|-\n|Bone\n|Collagen\n|20.0\n|160\n|-\n|Mud Crab Exoskeleton (wet)\n|Chitin\n|0.48\n|30\n|-\n|Prawn Exoskeleton (wet)\n|Chitin\n|0.55\n|28\n|-\n|Bovine Hoof\n|Keratin\n|0.40\n|16\n|-\n|Wool\n|Keratin\n|0.50\n|200\n|}\nProperties also decrease with the age of the fiber.

Hydrated, biopolymers generally have enhanced ductility and toughness. Water plays the role of a [[plasticizer]], a small molecule easing passage of polymer chains and in doing so increasing ductility and toughness. When using natural fibers in applications outside of their native use, the original level of hydration must be taken into account. For example when hydrated, the Young\u2019s Modulus of collagen decreases from 3.26 to 0.6 GPa and becomes both more ductile and tougher. Additionally the density of collagen decreases from 1.34 to 1.18 g/cm^3.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:19th century knowledge weaving flax hemp jute manila sisal vegetable fibers.jpg|thumb|19th century knowledge weaving [[flax]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[Manila hemp]], [[sisal]] and vegetable fibers]]\n\n=== Industrial use ===\nOf industrial value are four animal fibers, wool, silk, camel hair, and angora as well as four plant fibers, cotton, flax, hemp, and jute.

Hydrophobic polymer matrices offer insufficient adhesion for hydrophilic fibers.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Nanocomposites ===\n{{Main|Nanocomposite}}\nNanocomposites are desirable for their mechanical properties. When fillers in a composite are at the [[Nanometre|nanometer]] length scale, the surface to volume ratio of the filler material is high, which influences the bulk properties of the composite more compared to traditional composites. The properties of these nanosized elements is markedly different than that of its bulk constituent.\n\nIn regards to natural fibers, some of the best example of nanocomposites appear in biology. [[Bone]], [[Abalone|abalone shell]], [[nacre]], and tooth [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] are all nanocomposites. As of 2010, most synthetic polymer nanocomposites exhibit inferior toughness and mechanical properties compared to biological nanocomposites.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite journal |last1=Ji |first1=Baohua |last2=Gao |first2=Huajian |title=Mechanical Principles of Biological Nanocomposites |journal=Annual Review of Materials Research |date=2010-07-02 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=77\u2013100 |doi=10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104424 |language=en |bibcode=2010AnRMS..40...77J}}</ref> Completely synthetic nanocomposites do exist, however nanosized biopolymers are also being tested in synthetic matrices. Several types of protein based, nanosized fibers are being used in nanocomposites. These include collagen, cellulose, chitin and tunican.<ref name=\":22\" /> These structural proteins must be processed before use in composites.\n\nTo use cellulose as an example, [[semicrystalline]] microfibrils are sheared in the amorphous region, resulting in microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). These small, crystalline cellulose fibrils are at this points reclassified as a whisker and can be 2 to 20&nbsp;nm in diameter with shapes ranging from spherical to cylindrical. Whiskers of collagen, chitin, and cellulose have all be used to make biological nanocomposites. The matrix of these composites are commonly hydrophobic synthetic polymers such as polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride and copolymers of [[polystyrene]] and polyacrylate.<ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":12\" />\n\nTraditionally in composite science a strong interface between the matrix and filler is required to achieve favorable mechanical properties. If this is not the case, the phases tend to separate along the weak interface and makes for very poor mechanical properties. In a MCC composite however this is not the case, if the interaction between the filler and matrix is stronger than the filler-filler interaction the mechanical strength of the composite is noticeably decreased.<ref name=\":22\">{{cite journal|last2=Alloin|first2=Fannie|last3=Dufresne|first3=Alain|date=March 2005|title=Review of Recent Research into Cellulosic Whiskers, Their Properties and Their Application in Nanocomposite Field|journal=Biomacromolecules|volume=6|issue=2|pages=612\u2013626|doi=10.1021/bm0493685|pmid=15762621|last1=Azizi Samir|first1=My Ahmed Said}}</ref>\n\nDifficulties in natural fiber nanocomposites arise from dispersity and the tendency small fibers to aggregate in the matrix. Because of the high surface area to volume ratio the fibers have a tendency to aggregate, more so than in micro-scale composites. Additionally secondary processing of collagen sources to obtain sufficient purity collagen micro fibrils adds a degree of cost and challenge to creating a load bearing cellulose or other filler based nanocomposite.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n=== Biomaterial and biocompatibility ===\n{{Main|Biomaterial}}\nNatural fibers often show promise as biomaterials in medical applications.

This can lead either to integration in rare cases where the structure of the implant promotes regrowth of tissue with the implant forming a superstructure or degradation of the implant in which the backbones of the proteins are recognized for cleavage by the body.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Coir]]\n*[[Fiber]]\n*[[International Year of Natural Fibres 2009]]\n*[[Spider silk]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Natural fibers}}\n*[http://www.mundomaterial.eu/en/ Mundo Material]\n*[http://www.jute.org/plant_1.htm IJSG]\n\n{{fibers}}\n\n[[Category:Fibers]]\n[[Category:Natural materials]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2016}}\n{{Use American English|date = August 2019}}\n{{Fibre sidebar}}\n\n'''Natural fibers''' or '''natural fibres''' (see [[Spelling differences#-re.2C -er|spelling differences]]) are fibers that are produced by [[plants]], [[animals]], and [[geology|geological processes]].<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=John|first=Maya Jacob|last2=Thomas|first2=Sabu|date=2008-02-08|title=Biofibres and biocomposites|journal=Carbohydrate Polymers|volume=71|issue=3|pages=343\u2013364|doi=10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.05.040}}</ref> They can be used as a component of [[Composite material|composite]] materials, where the orientation of fibers impacts the properties.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Natural fibres : advances in science and technology towards industrial applications : from science to market|last=Sousa|first=Fangueiro, Raul Manuel Esteves de|last2=Sohel|first2=Rana|isbn=9789401775137|oclc=938890984|date = 2016-02-11}}</ref> Natural fibers can also be [[Felted|matted]] into sheets to make [[paper]] or [[felt]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Doelle|first=Klaus|date=2013-08-25|title=New Manufacturing Method for Paper Filler and Fiber Material|language=English|doi=10.2172/1091089 |osti=1091089|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc828520/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gillick|first=T.

Collagen has a hierarchical structure, forming triple helices, [[fibril]]s, and fibers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Keratin ===\n{{Main|Keratin}}\n[[File:Alpha Keratin Basic Structure.svg|thumb|Diagram showing the creation of alpha keratins helical structure.]]\nKeratin is a structural protein located at the hard surfaces in many vertebrates. Keratin has two forms, [[\u03b1-keratin]] and [[\u03b2-keratin]], that are found in different classes of chordates. The naming convention for these keratins follows that for protein structures: [[alpha helix|alpha]] keratin is [[helix|helical]] and [[beta sheet|beta]] keratin is sheet-like. Alpha keratin is found in [[mammal]]ian hair, skin, nails, horn and quills, while beta keratin can be found in [[bird|avian]] and [[reptile|reptilian]] species in scales, [[feather]]s, and beaks. The two different structures of keratin have dissimilar mechanical properties, as seen in their dissimilar applications. The relative alignment of the keratin fibrils has a significant impact on the mechanical properties. In human hair the filaments of alpha keratin are highly aligned, giving a tensile strength of approximately 200MPa. This tensile strength is an order of magnitude higher than human nails (20MPa), because human hair\u2019s keratin filaments are more aligned.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Properties ==\nCompared to synthetic fibers, natural fibers tend have decreased stiffness and strength.<ref name=\":2\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Tensile Mechanical Properties of Natural Fibers<ref name=\":2\" />\n!Material\n!Fiber\n!Elastic Modulus (GPa)\n!Strength (MPa)\n|-\n|Tendon\n|Collagen\n|1.50\n|150\n|-\n|Bone\n|Collagen\n|20.0\n|160\n|-\n|Mud Crab Exoskeleton (wet)\n|Chitin\n|0.48\n|30\n|-\n|Prawn Exoskeleton (wet)\n|Chitin\n|0.55\n|28\n|-\n|Bovine Hoof\n|Keratin\n|0.40\n|16\n|-\n|Wool\n|Keratin\n|0.50\n|200\n|}\nProperties also decrease with the age of the fiber.

Hydrated, biopolymers generally have enhanced ductility and toughness. Water plays the role of a [[plasticizer]], a small molecule easing passage of polymer chains and in doing so increasing ductility and toughness. When using natural fibers in applications outside of their native use, the original level of hydration must be taken into account. For example when hydrated, the Young\u2019s Modulus of collagen decreases from 3.26 to 0.6 GPa and becomes both more ductile and tougher. Additionally the density of collagen decreases from 1.34 to 1.18 g/cm^3.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:19th century knowledge weaving flax hemp jute manila sisal vegetable fibers.jpg|thumb|19th century knowledge weaving [[flax]], [[hemp]], [[jute]], [[Manila hemp]], [[sisal]] and vegetable fibers]]\n\n=== Industrial use ===\nOf industrial value are four animal fibers, wool, silk, camel hair, and angora as well as four plant fibers, cotton, flax, hemp, and jute.

Hydrophobic polymer matrices offer insufficient adhesion for hydrophilic fibers.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Nanocomposites ===\n{{Main|Nanocomposite}}\nNanocomposites are desirable for their mechanical properties. When fillers in a composite are at the [[Nanometre|nanometer]] length scale, the surface to volume ratio of the filler material is high, which influences the bulk properties of the composite more compared to traditional composites. The properties of these nanosized elements is markedly different than that of its bulk constituent.\n\nIn regards to natural fibers, some of the best example of nanocomposites appear in biology. [[Bone]], [[Abalone|abalone shell]], [[nacre]], and tooth [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] are all nanocomposites. As of 2010, most synthetic polymer nanocomposites exhibit inferior toughness and mechanical properties compared to biological nanocomposites.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite journal |last1=Ji |first1=Baohua |last2=Gao |first2=Huajian |title=Mechanical Principles of Biological Nanocomposites |journal=Annual Review of Materials Research |date=2010-07-02 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=77\u2013100 |doi=10.1146/annurev-matsci-070909-104424 |language=en |bibcode=2010AnRMS..40...77J}}</ref> Completely synthetic nanocomposites do exist, however nanosized biopolymers are also being tested in synthetic matrices. Several types of protein based, nanosized fibers are being used in nanocomposites. These include collagen, cellulose, chitin and tunican.<ref name=\":22\" /> These structural proteins must be processed before use in composites.\n\nTo use cellulose as an example, [[semicrystalline]] microfibrils are sheared in the amorphous region, resulting in microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). These small, crystalline cellulose fibrils are at this points reclassified as a whisker and can be 2 to 20&nbsp;nm in diameter with shapes ranging from spherical to cylindrical. Whiskers of collagen, chitin, and cellulose have all be used to make biological nanocomposites. The matrix of these composites are commonly hydrophobic synthetic polymers such as polyethylene, and polyvinyl chloride and copolymers of [[polystyrene]] and polyacrylate.<ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":12\" />\n\nTraditionally in composite science a strong interface between the matrix and filler is required to achieve favorable mechanical properties. If this is not the case, the phases tend to separate along the weak interface and makes for very poor mechanical properties. In a MCC composite however this is not the case, if the interaction between the filler and matrix is stronger than the filler-filler interaction the mechanical strength of the composite is noticeably decreased.<ref name=\":22\">{{cite journal|last2=Alloin|first2=Fannie|last3=Dufresne|first3=Alain|date=March 2005|title=Review of Recent Research into Cellulosic Whiskers, Their Properties and Their Application in Nanocomposite Field|journal=Biomacromolecules|volume=6|issue=2|pages=612\u2013626|doi=10.1021/bm0493685|pmid=15762621|last1=Azizi Samir|first1=My Ahmed Said}}</ref>\n\nDifficulties in natural fiber nanocomposites arise from dispersity and the tendency small fibers to aggregate in the matrix. Because of the high surface area to volume ratio the fibers have a tendency to aggregate, more so than in micro-scale composites. Additionally secondary processing of collagen sources to obtain sufficient purity collagen micro fibrils adds a degree of cost and challenge to creating a load bearing cellulose or other filler based nanocomposite.<ref name=\":22\" />\n\n=== Biomaterial and biocompatibility ===\n{{Main|Biomaterial}}\nNatural fibers often show promise as biomaterials in medical applications.

Implanting something made from naturally synthesized proteins, such as a keratin based implant, has the potential to be recognized as natural tissue by the body. This can lead either to integration in rare cases where the structure of the implant promotes regrowth of tissue with the implant forming a superstructure or degradation of the implant in which the backbones of the proteins are recognized for cleavage by the body.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Coir]]\n*[[Fiber]]\n*[[International Year of Natural Fibres 2009]]\n*[[Spider silk]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Natural fibers}}\n*[http://www.mundomaterial.eu/en/ Mundo Material]\n*[http://www.jute.org/plant_1.htm IJSG]\n\n{{fibers}}\n\n[[Category:Fibers]]\n[[Category:Natural materials]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Journal cites:, templated 1 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_fiber"}

In 1793, that government declared a mass conscription (''lev\u00e9e en masse'') with a call to service:<blockquote>Henceforth, until the enemies have been driven from the territory of the Republic, all the French are in permanent requisition for army service.

Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \"unredeemed\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since \"time immemorial\", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.<ref>Karine Varley, \"The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870\u20131914.\" in Jenny Macleod, ed., ''Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62\u201380.</ref>\n\nThe [[Dreyfus Affair]] in France 1894\u20131906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists.

Droysen moved from liberalism to an intense nationalism that celebrated Prussian Protestantism, efficiency, progress, and reform, in striking contrast to Austrian Catholicism, impotency and backwardness. He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia.  His large-scale ''History of Prussian Politics'' (14 vol 1855\u20131886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars. Von Sybel founded and edited the leading academic history journal, ''[[Historische Zeitschrift]]'' and as the director of the Prussian state archives published massive compilations that were devoured by scholars of nationalism.<ref>Louis L.

It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated the different states of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. The memory of the ''Risorgimento'' is central to Italian nationalism but it was based in the liberal [[middle class]]es and ultimately proved weak.<ref>Silvana Patriarca and Lucy Riall, eds., ''The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-century Italy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).</ref>   Two major groups remained opposed, \nthose from the [[Southern Italy|South or \"Mezzogiorno\"]] (formerly known as the [[Kingdom of the two Sicilies]]) and the devout Catholics. The new government treated the newly-annexed South as a conquered province with ridicule for its \"backward\" and poverty-stricken society, its poor grasp of standard Italian (as [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] dialects of [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] were prevalent in the common use) and its traditions. The liberals had always been strong opponents of the [[pope]] and the very well organized [[Catholic Church]]. The pope had been in political control of [[central Italy]]; he lost that in 1860 and Rome as well in 1870. He had long been the leader of opposition to modern liberalism and refused to accept the terms offered by the new Italian government. He called himself a \"prisoner\" in the Vatican and [[Non expedit|forbade Catholics]] to vote or engage in politics. The Catholic alienation lasted until 1929. The liberal government under the Sicilian [[Francesco Crispi]] sought to enlarge his political base by emulating [[Otto von Bismarck]] and firing up [[Italian nationalism]] with a hyper-aggressive foreign policy. It crashed and his cause was set back. Historian [[R. J. B. Bosworth|R.J.B. Bosworth]] says of his nationalistic foreign policy that:\n{{quote|(Crispi) pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with this suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies.  His policies were ruinous, both for Italy's trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi's lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at [[Battle of Adwa|Adowa]] ... in what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army.

Italy joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies in the First World War]] after getting promises of territory, but its war effort was a fiasco that discredited liberalism and paved the way for [[Benito Mussolini]] and a political doctrine of his own creation, fascism.

In the 1790s, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Prussia]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]\ninvaded, annexed, and subsequently [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]]. Napoleon set up the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as [[Congress Poland]] with the tsar proclaimed as \"King of Poland\". Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863\u201364]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to make the [[Polish language]], [[Culture of Poland|culture]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|religion]] more like Russia's. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939.  Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s.  The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.<ref>Richard Blanke, ''Prussian Poland in the German Empire (1871\u20131900)'' (1981)</ref><ref>Norman Davies, ''God's Playground: A History of Poland, Vol. 2: 1795 to the Present'' (2005).</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, many Polish nationalist leaders endorsed the [[Piast Concept]]. It held there was a Polish utopia during the [[Piast dynasty|Piast Dynasty]] a thousand years before, and modern Polish nationalists should restore its central values of Poland for the Poles. Jan Poplawski had developed the \"Piast Concept\" in the 1890s, and it formed the centerpiece of Polish nationalist ideology, especially as presented by the [[National-Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democracy Party]], known as the \"Endecja,\" which was led by [[Roman Dmowski]]. In contrast with the Jagiellon concept, there was no concept for a multi-ethnic Poland.<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey A.

The Jagiellon Concept was the official policy of the government in the 1920s and 1930s. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] dictator [[Josef Stalin]] at Tehran in 1943 rejected the Jagiellon Concept because it involved Polish rule over [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]].

This term originated from the word ''[[Zion]]'', which was one of the [[Torah]]'s names for the city of [[Jerusalem]]. The end goal of the nationalists and Zionists was a Jewish majority and in most cases, a state, in the [[Land of Israel|land of Palestine]]. A tumultuous history of living in oppressive, foreign, and uncertain circumstances led the supporters of the movement to draft a declaration of independence, claiming Israel as a birthplace. The first and second destructions of the temple and ancient Torah prophecies largely shaped the incentives of the Jewish nationalists. Many prominent theories in Jewish theology and eschatology were formed by supporters and opponents of the movement in this era.\n\nIt was the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, which sparked new waves of thinking across Europe regarding governance and sovereignty. A shift from the traditional hierarchy-based system towards political individualism and citizen-states posed a dilemma for the Jews. Citizenship was now essential, when it came to ensuring basic legal and residential rights. This resulted in more and more Jews choosing to identify with certain nationalities in order to maintain these rights. Logic said that a nation-based system of states  would require the Jews themselves to claim their own right to be considered a nation due to a distinguishable language and history. Historian David Engel has explained that Zionism was more about fear that a majority of worldwide Jews would end up dispersed and unprotected, rather than fulfilling old prophecies and traditions of historical texts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zionism|last=David|first=Engel|publisher=Pearson Longman Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===20th century===\n\n====China====\n{{main|Chinese nationalism}}\nThe awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent.  The key episode was the [[Russo-Japanese War|decisive defeat of Russia]] by Japan in 1905, demonstrating the military advancement of non-Europeans in a modern war. The defeat which quickly led to manifestations of a new interest in nationalism in China, as well as Turkey, and Persia.<ref>Rotem Kowner, ed., ''The impact of the Russo-Japanese war'' (Routledge, 2006).</ref> In China [[Sun Yat-sen]] (1866\u20131925) launched his new party the [[Kuomintang]] (National People's Party) in defiance of the decrepit Empire, which was run by outsiders. Kuomintang recruits pledged:\n:from this moment I will destroy the old and build the new, and fight for the self-determination of the people, and will apply all my strength to the support of the Chinese Republic and the realization of democracy through the Three Principles, ... for the progress of good government, the happiness and perpetual peace of the people, and for the strengthening of the foundations of the state in the name of peace throughout the world.<ref>Hans Kohn, ''Nationalism: Its Meaning and History'' (1955) p. 87.</ref>\nThe Kuomintang largely ran China until the Communists took over in 1949. But the latter had also been strongly influenced by Sun's nationalism as well as by the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919. It was a nationwide protest movement about the domestic backwardness of China and has often been depicted as the intellectual foundation for Chinese Communism.<ref>Shakhar Rahav, ''The Rise of Political Intellectuals in Modern China: May Fourth Societies and the Roots of Mass-Party Politics'' (Oxford UP, 2015).</ref> The [[New Culture Movement]] stimulated by the May Fourth Movement waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. According to historian Patricia Ebrey:\n:Nationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; [[imperialism]], [[feudalism]], [[warlordism]], autocracy, [[patriarchy]], and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations.<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (1996) p. 271</ref>\n:\n\n==== Greece ====\n{{Main articles|Greek nationalism}}\nNationalist [[Irredentism|irredentist]] movements Greek advocating for [[Enosis]] (unity of ethnincally Greek states with the [[Greece|Hellenic Republic]] to create a unified Greek state), used today in the case of [[Cyprus]], as well as the [[Megali Idea]], the Greek movement that advocated for the reconquering of Greek ancestral lands from the Ottoman Empire (such as [[Crete]], [[Ionia]], [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Northern Epirus]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Thrace]] among others) that were popular in the late 19th and early to 20th centuries, led to many Greek states and regions that were ethnically Greek to eventually unite with Greece and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish war of 1919]]. \n\nThe [[4th of August Regime|4th of August regime]] was a [[Fascism|fascist]] or fascistic nationalist authoritarian dictatorship inspired by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and led by Greek general [[Ioannis Metaxas]] from 1936 to his death in 1941. It advocated for the Third Hellenic Civilization, a culturally superior Greek civilization that would be the successor of the First and Second Greek civilizations, that were [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]] respectively. It promoted [[Culture of Greece|Greek traditions]], [[Greek folk music|folk music]] and [[Greek dances|dances]], [[classicism]] as well as [[medievalism]].\n\n====Africa====\n{{main|African nationalism|History of Africa}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-124-8.jpg|thumb|[[Kenneth Kaunda]], an anti-colonial political leader from [[Zambia]], pictured at a nationalist rally in colonial [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]) in 1960]]\n\nIn the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger.  In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere.\nAcross Africa nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers nor the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them.  Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S. Coleman, ''The Politics of the Developing Areas'' (1971)</ref><ref>Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam, ''Nationalism in colonial and post-colonial Africa'' (University Press of America, 1977).</ref><ref>Thomas Hodgkin, ''Nationalism in Colonial Africa'' (1956)</ref>\n\n[[History of South Africa|South Africa]], a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948 it was controlled by white [[Afrikaner]] nationalists focused on racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], which lasted until 1994, when [[1994 South African general election|elections]] were held. The black nationalist movement fought them until success was achieved and [[Nelson Mandela]] was elected President.<ref>Nancy L. Clark and William H. Worger, ''South Africa: The rise and fall of apartheid'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==== Middle East ====\n[[Arab nationalism]], a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the latter 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the [[Ottoman Empire]] declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs rather than foreigners. [[Syria]] was established in 1920; Transjordan (later [[Jordan]]) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; [[Saudi Arabia]] was established in 1932; and [[Egypt]] achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The [[Arab League]] was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.\n\nParallel to these efforts was the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] which emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. Beginning in 1882 Jews, predominantly from Europe, began emigrating to [[Ottoman Palestine]] with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The effort culminated in the declaration of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. As this move conflicted with the belief among Arab nationalists that Palestine was part of the Arab nation, the neighboring Arab nations [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|launched an invasion]] to claim the region. The invasion was only partly successful and led to decades of clashes between the Arab and Jewish nationalist ideologies.\n\n==== Post-Communism ====\nThere was a rise in extreme nationalism after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] triggered the collapse of [[communism]] in the 1990s. When communism fell, it left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, and they found themselves free to choose. Given free choice, long dormant conflicts rose up and created sources of serious conflict.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=1993|title=Nationalism Redux: Through the Glass of the Post-Communist States Darkly.|url=|journal=Ethnic Conflicts WorldWide, Current History|volume=|pages=162\u201366|via=}}</ref> When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nIn his 1992 article ''Jihad vs. McWorld,'' [[Benjamin Barber]] proposed that the fall of communism will cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small scale wars will become common; groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Benjamin|date=1992|title=Jihad vs. McWorld: the two axial principles of our age\u2014tribalism and globalism\u2014clash at every point except one: they may both be threatening to democracy|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Communism's fall also allowed for an  \"us vs. them\" mentality to sprout up.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|date=1993|title=The Clash of Civilizations|url=|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=72|issue=3|pages=22\u201349|doi=10.2307/20045621|jstor=20045621}}</ref> Governments become vehicles for social interests and the country will attempt to form national policies based on the majority, for example culture, religion or ethnicity.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some newly sprouted democracies have large differences in policies on matters that ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.\n\nAcademic Steven Berg felt that at the root of nationalist conflicts is the demand for autonomy and a separate existence.<ref name=\":0\" /> This nationalism can give rise to strong emotions that may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries.<ref name=\":0\" /> Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs, causing death and destruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> When this would happen, those states who were unable to contain the conflict ran the risk of slowing their democratization progress.\n\nYugoslavia was established after WWI and was a merger of three separate ethnic groups; Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  The national census numbers for a ten-year span 1971\u20131981 measured an increase from 1.3 to 5.4% in their population that ethnically identified as Yugoslav.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=2004|title=Why Yugoslavia Fell Apart|url=|journal=Current History|volume=92:577|pages=357\u201363|via=}}</ref> This meant that the country, almost as a whole, was divided by distinctive religious, ethnic or national loyalties after nearly 50 years.\n\nWithin Yugoslavia, separating Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia is an invisible line of previous conquests of the region. Croatia and Slovenia to the northwest were conquered by Catholics or Protestants, and benefited from European history; the Renaissance, French Revolution, Industrial Revolution and are more inclined towards democracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The remaining Yugoslavian territory was conquered by the Ottoman or Tsarists empires; are Orthodox or Muslims, are less economically advanced and are less inclined toward democracy.\n\nIn the 1970s the leadership of the separate territories within Yugoslavia protected only territorial interests at the expense of other territories. In Croatia, there was almost a split within the territory between Serbs and Croats so any political decision would kindle unrest, and tensions could cross the territories adjacent; Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=\":3\" /> Within Bosnia there was no group who had a majority; Muslim, Serb, Croat, and Yugoslav were all there so the leadership could not advance here either.  Political organizations were not able to deal successfully with such diverse nationalism. Within the territories the leadership could not compromise. To do so would create a winner in one ethnic group and a loser in another, raising the possibility of a serious conflict.  This strengthened the political stance promoting ethnic identities. This caused intense and divided political leadership within Yugoslavia.\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|250px|[[List of national border changes since World War I|Changes in national boundaries]] in post-Soviet states after the collapse of communism followed by a resurgence of nationalism.]]\nIn the 1980s Yugoslavia began to break into fragments.<ref name=\":1\" /> The economic conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating. Conflict in the disputed territories was stimulated by the rise in mass nationalism and inter-ethnic hostilities.<ref name=\":3\" /> The per-capita income of people in the northwest territory, encompassing Croatia and Slovenia, in contrast to the southern territory were several times higher. This combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs within Kosovo intensified economic conditions.<ref name=\":3\" /> This violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in Serbia and within Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by Communist Serbian Slobodan Milosevic to further increase Serb nationalism. As mentioned, this nationalism did give rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism through highly nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Serbian nationalism was so high, Slobodan Milosevic was able to oust leaders in Vojvodina and Montenegro, further repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories.<ref name=\":3\" /> Slovenia, one of the four regions not under Communist control, favoring a democratic state.\n\nWithin Slovenia, fear was mounting because Milosevic was using the militia to suppress a in Kosovo, what would he do to Slovenia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Half of Yugoslavia wanted to be democratic, the other wanted a new nationalist authoritarian regime. In fall of 1989 tensions came to a head and Slovenia asserted its political and economic independence from Yugoslavia and seceded. In January 1990, there was a total break with Serbia at the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an institution conceived by Milosevic to strengthen unity and became the backdrop for the fall of communism within Yugoslavia.\n\nIn August 1990, a warning to the region was issued when ethnically divided groups attempted to alter the government structure. The republic borders established by the Communist regime in the postwar period were extremely vulnerable to challenges from ethnic communities.Ethnic communities arose because they did not share the identity with everyone within the new post-Communist borders.<ref name=\":3\" /> This threatened the new governments. The same disputes were erupting that were in place prior to Milosevic and were compounded by actions from his regime.\n\nAlso within the territory the Croats and the Serbs were in direct competition for control of government. Elections were held and increased potential conflicts between Serb and Croat nationalism. Serbia wanted to be separate and decide its own future based on its own ethnic composition. But this would then give Kosovo encouragement to become independent from Serbia. Albanians in Kosovo were already independent from Kosovo. Serbia didn't want to let Kosovo become independent. Muslims nationalists wanted their own territory but it would require a redrawing of the map, and would threaten neighboring territories. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nNationalism again gave rise to powerful emotions which evoked in some extreme cases, a willingness to die for what you believe in, a fight for the survival of the group.<ref name=\":0\" /> The end of communism began a long period of conflict and war for the region. In the six years following the collapse 200,000-500-000 people died in the Bosnian war.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina|date=1996|title=Eastern Europe's Painful Transition|url=|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=97\u2013102|via=}}</ref> Bosnian Muslims suffered at the hands of the Serbs and Croats.<ref name=\":2\" /> The war garnered assistance from groups; Muslim, Orthodox and Western Christian as well as state actors who supplied all sides; Saudi Arabia and Iran supported Bosnia, Russia supported Serbia, Central European and Western countries including the U.S. supported Croatia, and the Pope supported Slovenia and Croatia.\n\n===21st century===\n{{main|Neo-nationalism}}\n\n[[Arab nationalism]] began to decline in the 21st century leading to localized nationalism, culminating in a series of revolts against authoritarian regimes between 2010 and 2012, known as the ''[[Arab Spring]]''. Following these revolts, which mostly failed to improve conditions in the affected nations, Arab nationalism and even most local nationalistic movements declined dramatically.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=What is the point of the Arab League? |date=29 April 2016 |magazine=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21698047-sad-decline-once-bold-organisation-what-point-arab-league}}</ref> A consequence of the [[Arab Spring]] as well as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] were the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|civil wars in Iraq]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], which eventually joined to form a [[Spillover of the Syrian Civil War|single conflict]].

They lack a modern self-sustainable economy, have divided authorities, and use multiple languages resulting in many groups being unable to communicate with each other.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nProminent theorists who developed the modernist interpretation of nations and nationalism include: [[Carlton J. H. Hayes]], [[Henry Maine]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee]] and [[Talcott Parsons]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nHenry Maine in his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies noted the key distinction between traditional societies defined as \"status\" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals; and modern societies defined as \"contract\" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies in his book ''[[Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1887) defined a ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies, while defining a ''Gesellschaft'' (society) as an impersonal society that is modern. While he recognized the advantages of modern societies he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused [[Social alienation|alienation]] while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n\u00c9mile Durkheim expanded upon T\u00f6nnies' recognition of alienation, and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon \"mechanical solidarity\" versus societies based on \"organic solidarity\".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}} Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of [[anomie]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nMax Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber's conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n===Primordialist evolutionary interpretation===\nAnother approach emerging from biology and psychology looks at long-term evolutionary forces that might lead to nationalism.

Thinkers like [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] reinterpreted Darwin's theory of natural selection \"often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution\" by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=495-496}} Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=268}}\n\nApproached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=271}} There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}} As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}}\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Nationalist and liberal pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]\n\nCritics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area, and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:\n:the articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, \"distal\" points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.<ref>Robert Hislope \"From Ontology to Analogy: Evolutionary Theories and the Explanation of Ethnic Politics: in Patrick James and David Goetze ed.

On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French [[Legitimism]] or Spanish [[Carlism]] often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the [[Corsican Republic]], [[United Irishmen]], [[Breton Federalist League]] or [[Catalan Republican Party]] could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.\n\nLiberal nationalism is kind of non-[[xenophobic]] nationalism that is claimed to be compatible with [[liberal values]] of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].<ref>Tamir, Yael. 1993.

Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individuals resident within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose  ([[Ernest Renan]]'s classic description in [[What is a Nation?]] (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavour).

Its proponents contend that liberalism and nationalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that they can in fact be made compatible. Liberal nationalists urge one to consider nationalism not as the pathology of modernity but as an answer to its malaise. For them, nationalism is more than an infantile disease, more than \"the measles of mankind\" as Einstein once proclaimed it to be. They argue that nationalism is a legitimate way of understanding one's role and place in life. They strive for a normative justification of nationalism which lies within liberal limits.

Allegiance to the Napoleonic states was rejected, and increasingly the creoles demanded independence. They achieved it after civil wars 1808\u20131826.<ref>D. A.

Some nationalists, defining the national community in ethnic, linguistic, cultural, historic, or religious terms (or a combination of these), may then seek to deem certain minorities as not truly being a part of the 'national community' as they define it.

[[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.\n\nSome of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are [[anti-individualism]], [[statism]], radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.\n\nPan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on \"clusters\" of ethnic groups. [[Pan-Slavism]] is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all [[Slavic people]] into one country. They did succeed by uniting several [[South Slavs|south Slavic]] people into [[Yugoslavia]] in 1918.<ref>Ivo Banac, ''The National Question in Yugoslavia'' (Cornell University Press, 1984).</ref>\n\n===Anti-colonial nationalism===\n[[File:Crowd demonstrates against Great Britain in Cairo.jpg|thumb|Crowd demonstrates against Britain in [[Cairo]] on 23 October 1951 as tension continued to mount in the dispute between Egypt and Britain over control of the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].]]\nThis form of nationalism came about during the [[decolonization]] of the post war periods. It was a reaction mainly in Africa and Asia against being subdued by foreign powers. It also appeared in the non-Russian territories of the Tsarist empire and later, the USSR, where Ukrainianists and Islamic Marxists condemned Russian Bolshevik rule in their territories as a renewed Russian imperialism. This form of nationalism took many guises, including the peaceful passive resistance movement led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in the Indian subcontinent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grant|first=Moyra|title=Politics Review|url=http://moodle.collyers.ac.uk/file.php/465/Politics_Review_articles/nationalism_expansionistanddesrtuctive.pdf|publisher=Politics Review|accessdate=16 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nBenedict Anderson argued that anti-colonial nationalism is grounded in the experience of literate and bilingual indigenous intellectuals fluent in the language of the imperial power, schooled in its \"national\" history, and staffing the colonial administrative cadres up to but not including its highest levels.

The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe. However, even in that early stage there was an ideological critique of nationalism which has developed into several forms of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and anti-nationalism. The [[Islamic revival]] of the 20th century also produced an [[Islamism|Islamist]] critique of the nation-state.

He may be a positive or a negative nationalist\u2014that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating\u2014but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side.

The historian [[Lord Acton]] put the case against \"nationalism as insanity\" in 1862.

In 1793, that government declared a mass conscription (''lev\u00e9e en masse'') with a call to service:<blockquote>Henceforth, until the enemies have been driven from the territory of the Republic, all the French are in permanent requisition for army service.

Defeat in war, with a loss in territory, was a powerful force in nationalism.

Revanchism draws its strength from patriotic and retributionist thought and it is often motivated by economic or geo-political factors. Extreme revanchist ideologues often represent a hawkish stance, suggesting that their desired objectives can be achieved through the positive outcome of another war. It is linked with irredentism, the conception that a part of the cultural and ethnic nation remains \"unredeemed\" outside the borders of its appropriate nation state. Revanchist politics often rely on the identification of a nation with a nation state, often mobilizing deep-rooted sentiments of ethnic nationalism, claiming territories outside the state where members of the ethnic group live, while using heavy-handed nationalism to mobilize support for these aims. Revanchist justifications are often presented as based on ancient or even autochthonous occupation of a territory since \"time immemorial\", an assertion that is usually inextricably involved in revanchism and irredentism, justifying them in the eyes of their proponents.<ref>Karine Varley, \"The Taboos of Defeat: Unmentionable Memories of the Franco-Prussian War in France, 1870\u20131914.\" in Jenny Macleod, ed., ''Defeat and Memory: Cultural Histories of Military Defeat in the Modern Era'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2008) pp. 62\u201380.</ref>\n\nThe [[Dreyfus Affair]] in France 1894\u20131906 made the battle against treason and disloyalty a central theme for conservative Catholic French nationalists.

Droysen moved from liberalism to an intense nationalism that celebrated Prussian Protestantism, efficiency, progress, and reform, in striking contrast to Austrian Catholicism, impotency and backwardness. He idealized the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia.  His large-scale ''History of Prussian Politics'' (14 vol 1855\u20131886) was foundational for nationalistic students and scholars. Von Sybel founded and edited the leading academic history journal, ''[[Historische Zeitschrift]]'' and as the director of the Prussian state archives published massive compilations that were devoured by scholars of nationalism.<ref>Louis L.

It was the political and intellectual movement that consolidated the different states of the [[Italian peninsula]] into the single state of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861. The memory of the ''Risorgimento'' is central to Italian nationalism but it was based in the liberal [[middle class]]es and ultimately proved weak.<ref>Silvana Patriarca and Lucy Riall, eds., ''The Risorgimento Revisited: Nationalism and Culture in Nineteenth-century Italy'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2011).</ref>   Two major groups remained opposed, \nthose from the [[Southern Italy|South or \"Mezzogiorno\"]] (formerly known as the [[Kingdom of the two Sicilies]]) and the devout Catholics. The new government treated the newly-annexed South as a conquered province with ridicule for its \"backward\" and poverty-stricken society, its poor grasp of standard Italian (as [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] dialects of [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] were prevalent in the common use) and its traditions. The liberals had always been strong opponents of the [[pope]] and the very well organized [[Catholic Church]]. The pope had been in political control of [[central Italy]]; he lost that in 1860 and Rome as well in 1870. He had long been the leader of opposition to modern liberalism and refused to accept the terms offered by the new Italian government. He called himself a \"prisoner\" in the Vatican and [[Non expedit|forbade Catholics]] to vote or engage in politics. The Catholic alienation lasted until 1929. The liberal government under the Sicilian [[Francesco Crispi]] sought to enlarge his political base by emulating [[Otto von Bismarck]] and firing up [[Italian nationalism]] with a hyper-aggressive foreign policy. It crashed and his cause was set back. Historian [[R. J. B. Bosworth|R.J.B. Bosworth]] says of his nationalistic foreign policy that:\n{{quote|(Crispi) pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with this suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies.  His policies were ruinous, both for Italy's trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi's lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at [[Battle of Adwa|Adowa]] ... in what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army. Crispi, whose private life (he was perhaps a trigamist) and personal finances...were objects of perennial scandal, went into dishonorable retirement.| R.J.B. Bosworth, ''Italy and the Wider World: 1860\u20131960'', 2013, Routledge, p.29, {{ISBN|978-1-134-78088-4}} }}\nMeanwhile, a third major group emerged that was hostile to nationalism as radical socialist elements became a force in the industrial [[Northern Italy|North]], and they too rejected liberalism. Italy joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies in the First World War]] after getting promises of territory, but its war effort was a fiasco that discredited liberalism and paved the way for [[Benito Mussolini]] and a political doctrine of his own creation, fascism. Mussolini's 20-year dictatorship involved a highly aggressive nationalism that led to a series of wars, an alliance with Hitler's Germany, and humiliation and hardship in the Second World War.

In the 1790s, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Prussia]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]\ninvaded, annexed, and subsequently [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]]. Napoleon set up the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as [[Congress Poland]] with the tsar proclaimed as \"King of Poland\". Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863\u201364]] but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to make the [[Polish language]], [[Culture of Poland|culture]] and [[Roman Catholic Church|religion]] more like Russia's. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to re-establish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939.  Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s.  The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically. He responded by stopping the harassment and cooperating with the Centre Party.<ref>Richard Blanke, ''Prussian Poland in the German Empire (1871\u20131900)'' (1981)</ref><ref>Norman Davies, ''God's Playground: A History of Poland, Vol. 2: 1795 to the Present'' (2005).</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, many Polish nationalist leaders endorsed the [[Piast Concept]]. It held there was a Polish utopia during the [[Piast dynasty|Piast Dynasty]] a thousand years before, and modern Polish nationalists should restore its central values of Poland for the Poles. Jan Poplawski had developed the \"Piast Concept\" in the 1890s, and it formed the centerpiece of Polish nationalist ideology, especially as presented by the [[National-Democratic Party (Poland)|National Democracy Party]], known as the \"Endecja,\" which was led by [[Roman Dmowski]]. In contrast with the Jagiellon concept, there was no concept for a multi-ethnic Poland.<ref>{{cite book|author=Geoffrey A.

The Jagiellon Concept was the official policy of the government in the 1920s and 1930s. [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] dictator [[Josef Stalin]] at Tehran in 1943 rejected the Jagiellon Concept because it involved Polish rule over [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]].

This term originated from the word ''[[Zion]]'', which was one of the [[Torah]]'s names for the city of [[Jerusalem]]. The end goal of the nationalists and Zionists was a Jewish majority and in most cases, a state, in the [[Land of Israel|land of Palestine]]. A tumultuous history of living in oppressive, foreign, and uncertain circumstances led the supporters of the movement to draft a declaration of independence, claiming Israel as a birthplace. The first and second destructions of the temple and ancient Torah prophecies largely shaped the incentives of the Jewish nationalists. Many prominent theories in Jewish theology and eschatology were formed by supporters and opponents of the movement in this era.\n\nIt was the [[French Revolution]] of 1789, which sparked new waves of thinking across Europe regarding governance and sovereignty. A shift from the traditional hierarchy-based system towards political individualism and citizen-states posed a dilemma for the Jews. Citizenship was now essential, when it came to ensuring basic legal and residential rights. This resulted in more and more Jews choosing to identify with certain nationalities in order to maintain these rights. Logic said that a nation-based system of states  would require the Jews themselves to claim their own right to be considered a nation due to a distinguishable language and history. Historian David Engel has explained that Zionism was more about fear that a majority of worldwide Jews would end up dispersed and unprotected, rather than fulfilling old prophecies and traditions of historical texts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Zionism|last=David|first=Engel|publisher=Pearson Longman Publishing Group|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===20th century===\n\n====China====\n{{main|Chinese nationalism}}\nThe awakening of nationalism across Asia helped shape the history of the continent.  The key episode was the [[Russo-Japanese War|decisive defeat of Russia]] by Japan in 1905, demonstrating the military advancement of non-Europeans in a modern war. The defeat which quickly led to manifestations of a new interest in nationalism in China, as well as Turkey, and Persia.<ref>Rotem Kowner, ed., ''The impact of the Russo-Japanese war'' (Routledge, 2006).</ref> In China [[Sun Yat-sen]] (1866\u20131925) launched his new party the [[Kuomintang]] (National People's Party) in defiance of the decrepit Empire, which was run by outsiders. Kuomintang recruits pledged:\n:from this moment I will destroy the old and build the new, and fight for the self-determination of the people, and will apply all my strength to the support of the Chinese Republic and the realization of democracy through the Three Principles, ... for the progress of good government, the happiness and perpetual peace of the people, and for the strengthening of the foundations of the state in the name of peace throughout the world.<ref>Hans Kohn, ''Nationalism: Its Meaning and History'' (1955) p. 87.</ref>\nThe Kuomintang largely ran China until the Communists took over in 1949. But the latter had also been strongly influenced by Sun's nationalism as well as by the [[May Fourth Movement]] in 1919. It was a nationwide protest movement about the domestic backwardness of China and has often been depicted as the intellectual foundation for Chinese Communism.<ref>Shakhar Rahav, ''The Rise of Political Intellectuals in Modern China: May Fourth Societies and the Roots of Mass-Party Politics'' (Oxford UP, 2015).</ref> The [[New Culture Movement]] stimulated by the May Fourth Movement waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. According to historian Patricia Ebrey:\n:Nationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; [[imperialism]], [[feudalism]], [[warlordism]], autocracy, [[patriarchy]], and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations.<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (1996) p. 271</ref>\n:\n\n==== Greece ====\n{{Main articles|Greek nationalism}}\nNationalist [[Irredentism|irredentist]] movements Greek advocating for [[Enosis]] (unity of ethnincally Greek states with the [[Greece|Hellenic Republic]] to create a unified Greek state), used today in the case of [[Cyprus]], as well as the [[Megali Idea]], the Greek movement that advocated for the reconquering of Greek ancestral lands from the Ottoman Empire (such as [[Crete]], [[Ionia]], [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Northern Epirus]], [[Cappadocia]], [[Thrace]] among others) that were popular in the late 19th and early to 20th centuries, led to many Greek states and regions that were ethnically Greek to eventually unite with Greece and the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish war of 1919]]. \n\nThe [[4th of August Regime|4th of August regime]] was a [[Fascism|fascist]] or fascistic nationalist authoritarian dictatorship inspired by [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and led by Greek general [[Ioannis Metaxas]] from 1936 to his death in 1941. It advocated for the Third Hellenic Civilization, a culturally superior Greek civilization that would be the successor of the First and Second Greek civilizations, that were [[Ancient Greece]] and the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine empire]] respectively. It promoted [[Culture of Greece|Greek traditions]], [[Greek folk music|folk music]] and [[Greek dances|dances]], [[classicism]] as well as [[medievalism]].\n\n====Africa====\n{{main|African nationalism|History of Africa}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-124-8.jpg|thumb|[[Kenneth Kaunda]], an anti-colonial political leader from [[Zambia]], pictured at a nationalist rally in colonial [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]) in 1960]]\n\nIn the 1880s the European powers divided up almost all of Africa (only [[Ethiopia]] and [[Liberia]] were independent). They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger.  In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere.\nAcross Africa nationalism drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers nor the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them.  Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S. Coleman, ''The Politics of the Developing Areas'' (1971)</ref><ref>Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam, ''Nationalism in colonial and post-colonial Africa'' (University Press of America, 1977).</ref><ref>Thomas Hodgkin, ''Nationalism in Colonial Africa'' (1956)</ref>\n\n[[History of South Africa|South Africa]], a British colony, was exceptional in that it became virtually independent by 1931. From 1948 it was controlled by white [[Afrikaner]] nationalists focused on racial segregation and white minority rule known officially as [[apartheid]], which lasted until 1994, when [[1994 South African general election|elections]] were held. The black nationalist movement fought them until success was achieved and [[Nelson Mandela]] was elected President.<ref>Nancy L. Clark and William H. Worger, ''South Africa: The rise and fall of apartheid'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==== Middle East ====\n[[Arab nationalism]], a movement toward liberating and empowering the Arab peoples of the Middle East, emerged during the latter 19th century, inspired by other independence movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. As the [[Ottoman Empire]] declined and the Middle East was carved up by the Great Powers of Europe, Arabs sought to establish their own independent nations ruled by Arabs rather than foreigners. [[Syria]] was established in 1920; Transjordan (later [[Jordan]]) gradually gained independence between 1921 and 1946; [[Saudi Arabia]] was established in 1932; and [[Egypt]] achieved gradually gained independence between 1922 and 1952. The [[Arab League]] was established in 1945 to promote Arab interests and cooperation between the new Arab states.\n\nParallel to these efforts was the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] which emerged among European Jews in the 19th century. Beginning in 1882 Jews, predominantly from Europe, began emigrating to [[Ottoman Palestine]] with the goal of establishing a new Jewish homeland. The effort culminated in the declaration of the [[State of Israel]] in 1948. As this move conflicted with the belief among Arab nationalists that Palestine was part of the Arab nation, the neighboring Arab nations [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|launched an invasion]] to claim the region. The invasion was only partly successful and led to decades of clashes between the Arab and Jewish nationalist ideologies.\n\n==== Post-Communism ====\nThere was a rise in extreme nationalism after the [[Revolutions of 1989]] triggered the collapse of [[communism]] in the 1990s. When communism fell, it left many people with no identity. The people under communist rule had to integrate, and they found themselves free to choose. Given free choice, long dormant conflicts rose up and created sources of serious conflict.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=1993|title=Nationalism Redux: Through the Glass of the Post-Communist States Darkly.|url=|journal=Ethnic Conflicts WorldWide, Current History|volume=|pages=162\u201366|via=}}</ref> When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nIn his 1992 article ''Jihad vs. McWorld,'' [[Benjamin Barber]] proposed that the fall of communism will cause large numbers of people to search for unity and that small scale wars will become common; groups will attempt to redraw boundaries, identities, cultures and ideologies.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Barber|first=Benjamin|date=1992|title=Jihad vs. McWorld: the two axial principles of our age\u2014tribalism and globalism\u2014clash at every point except one: they may both be threatening to democracy|url=|journal=The Atlantic|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Communism's fall also allowed for an  \"us vs. them\" mentality to sprout up.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Huntington|first=Samuel|date=1993|title=The Clash of Civilizations|url=|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=72|issue=3|pages=22\u201349|doi=10.2307/20045621|jstor=20045621}}</ref> Governments become vehicles for social interests and the country will attempt to form national policies based on the majority, for example culture, religion or ethnicity.<ref name=\":0\" /> Some newly sprouted democracies have large differences in policies on matters that ranged from immigration and human rights to trade and commerce.\n\nAcademic Steven Berg felt that at the root of nationalist conflicts is the demand for autonomy and a separate existence.<ref name=\":0\" /> This nationalism can give rise to strong emotions that may lead to a group fighting to survive, especially as after the fall of communism, political boundaries did not match ethnic boundaries.<ref name=\":0\" /> Serious conflicts often arose and escalated very easily as individuals and groups acted upon their beliefs, causing death and destruction.<ref name=\":0\" /> When this would happen, those states who were unable to contain the conflict ran the risk of slowing their democratization progress.\n\nYugoslavia was established after WWI and was a merger of three separate ethnic groups; Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.  The national census numbers for a ten-year span 1971\u20131981 measured an increase from 1.3 to 5.4% in their population that ethnically identified as Yugoslav.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Steven|date=2004|title=Why Yugoslavia Fell Apart|url=|journal=Current History|volume=92:577|pages=357\u201363|via=}}</ref> This meant that the country, almost as a whole, was divided by distinctive religious, ethnic or national loyalties after nearly 50 years.\n\nWithin Yugoslavia, separating Croatia and Slovenia from the rest of Yugoslavia is an invisible line of previous conquests of the region. Croatia and Slovenia to the northwest were conquered by Catholics or Protestants, and benefited from European history; the Renaissance, French Revolution, Industrial Revolution and are more inclined towards democracy.<ref name=\":2\" /> The remaining Yugoslavian territory was conquered by the Ottoman or Tsarists empires; are Orthodox or Muslims, are less economically advanced and are less inclined toward democracy.\n\nIn the 1970s the leadership of the separate territories within Yugoslavia protected only territorial interests at the expense of other territories. In Croatia, there was almost a split within the territory between Serbs and Croats so any political decision would kindle unrest, and tensions could cross the territories adjacent; Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=\":3\" /> Within Bosnia there was no group who had a majority; Muslim, Serb, Croat, and Yugoslav were all there so the leadership could not advance here either.  Political organizations were not able to deal successfully with such diverse nationalism. Within the territories the leadership could not compromise. To do so would create a winner in one ethnic group and a loser in another, raising the possibility of a serious conflict.  This strengthened the political stance promoting ethnic identities. This caused intense and divided political leadership within Yugoslavia.\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|250px|[[List of national border changes since World War I|Changes in national boundaries]] in post-Soviet states after the collapse of communism followed by a resurgence of nationalism.]]\nIn the 1980s Yugoslavia began to break into fragments.<ref name=\":1\" /> The economic conditions within Yugoslavia were deteriorating. Conflict in the disputed territories was stimulated by the rise in mass nationalism and inter-ethnic hostilities.<ref name=\":3\" /> The per-capita income of people in the northwest territory, encompassing Croatia and Slovenia, in contrast to the southern territory were several times higher. This combined with escalating violence from ethnic Albanians and Serbs within Kosovo intensified economic conditions.<ref name=\":3\" /> This violence greatly contributed to the rise of extreme nationalism of Serbs in Serbia and within Yugoslavia. The ongoing conflict in Kosovo was propagandized by Communist Serbian Slobodan Milosevic to further increase Serb nationalism. As mentioned, this nationalism did give rise to powerful emotions which grew the force of Serbian nationalism through highly nationalist demonstrations in Vojvodina, Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Serbian nationalism was so high, Slobodan Milosevic was able to oust leaders in Vojvodina and Montenegro, further repressed Albanians within Kosovo and eventually controlled four of the eight regions/territories.<ref name=\":3\" /> Slovenia, one of the four regions not under Communist control, favoring a democratic state.\n\nWithin Slovenia, fear was mounting because Milosevic was using the militia to suppress a in Kosovo, what would he do to Slovenia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Half of Yugoslavia wanted to be democratic, the other wanted a new nationalist authoritarian regime. In fall of 1989 tensions came to a head and Slovenia asserted its political and economic independence from Yugoslavia and seceded. In January 1990, there was a total break with Serbia at the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, an institution conceived by Milosevic to strengthen unity and became the backdrop for the fall of communism within Yugoslavia.\n\nIn August 1990, a warning to the region was issued when ethnically divided groups attempted to alter the government structure. The republic borders established by the Communist regime in the postwar period were extremely vulnerable to challenges from ethnic communities.Ethnic communities arose because they did not share the identity with everyone within the new post-Communist borders.<ref name=\":3\" /> This threatened the new governments. The same disputes were erupting that were in place prior to Milosevic and were compounded by actions from his regime.\n\nAlso within the territory the Croats and the Serbs were in direct competition for control of government. Elections were held and increased potential conflicts between Serb and Croat nationalism. Serbia wanted to be separate and decide its own future based on its own ethnic composition. But this would then give Kosovo encouragement to become independent from Serbia. Albanians in Kosovo were already independent from Kosovo. Serbia didn't want to let Kosovo become independent. Muslims nationalists wanted their own territory but it would require a redrawing of the map, and would threaten neighboring territories. When communism fell in Yugoslavia, serious conflict arose, which led to the rise in extreme nationalism.\n\nNationalism again gave rise to powerful emotions which evoked in some extreme cases, a willingness to die for what you believe in, a fight for the survival of the group.<ref name=\":0\" /> The end of communism began a long period of conflict and war for the region. In the six years following the collapse 200,000-500-000 people died in the Bosnian war.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina|date=1996|title=Eastern Europe's Painful Transition|url=|journal=Current History|volume=|pages=97\u2013102|via=}}</ref> Bosnian Muslims suffered at the hands of the Serbs and Croats.<ref name=\":2\" /> The war garnered assistance from groups; Muslim, Orthodox and Western Christian as well as state actors who supplied all sides; Saudi Arabia and Iran supported Bosnia, Russia supported Serbia, Central European and Western countries including the U.S. supported Croatia, and the Pope supported Slovenia and Croatia.\n\n===21st century===\n{{main|Neo-nationalism}}\n\n[[Arab nationalism]] began to decline in the 21st century leading to localized nationalism, culminating in a series of revolts against authoritarian regimes between 2010 and 2012, known as the ''[[Arab Spring]]''. Following these revolts, which mostly failed to improve conditions in the affected nations, Arab nationalism and even most local nationalistic movements declined dramatically.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=What is the point of the Arab League? |date=29 April 2016 |magazine=The Economist |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21698047-sad-decline-once-bold-organisation-what-point-arab-league}}</ref> A consequence of the [[Arab Spring]] as well as the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] were the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014\u20132017)|civil wars in Iraq]] and [[Syrian Civil War|Syria]], which eventually joined to form a [[Spillover of the Syrian Civil War|single conflict]].

Many scholars believe that the development of nationalism in Europe (and subsequently the modern nation-state) was due to the threat of war. \"External threats have such a powerful effect on nationalism because people realize in a profound manner that they are under threat because of who they are as a nation; they are forced to recognize that it is only as a nation that they can successfully defeat the threat\".<sup>[[Nationalism#cite note-herbst-war-and-state-62|[62]]]</sup> With increased external threats, the state's extractive capacities increase.

They lack a modern self-sustainable economy, have divided authorities, and use multiple languages resulting in many groups being unable to communicate with each other.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nProminent theorists who developed the modernist interpretation of nations and nationalism include: [[Carlton J. H. Hayes]], [[Henry Maine]], [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], [[Max Weber]], [[Arnold Joseph Toynbee]] and [[Talcott Parsons]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=508\u201309}}\n\nHenry Maine in his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies noted the key distinction between traditional societies defined as \"status\" societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals; and modern societies defined as \"contract\" societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nFerdinand T\u00f6nnies in his book ''[[Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1887) defined a ''Gemeinschaft'' (community) as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies, while defining a ''Gesellschaft'' (society) as an impersonal society that is modern. While he recognized the advantages of modern societies he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused [[Social alienation|alienation]] while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n\u00c9mile Durkheim expanded upon T\u00f6nnies' recognition of alienation, and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon \"mechanical solidarity\" versus societies based on \"organic solidarity\".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}} Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of [[anomie]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\nMax Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber's conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=510}}\n\n===Primordialist evolutionary interpretation===\nAnother approach emerging from biology and psychology looks at long-term evolutionary forces that might lead to nationalism.  The primordialist perspective is based upon evolutionary theory.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|pp=272\u201373}}<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 4236409|title = Evolution, Mobility, and Ethnic Group Formation|journal = Politics and the Life Sciences|volume = 17|issue = 1|pages = 59\u201371|last1 = Goetze|first1 = David|year = 1998|doi = 10.1017/S0730938400025363}}</ref>\n\nThis approach has been popular with the general public but is typically rejected by experts.

Thinkers like [[Herbert Spencer]] and [[Walter Bagehot]] reinterpreted Darwin's theory of natural selection \"often in ways inconsistent with Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution\" by making unsupported claims of biological difference among groups, ethnicities, races, and nations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=495-496}} Modern evolutionary sciences have distanced themselves from such views, but notions of long-term evolutionary change remain foundational to the work of evolutionary psychologists like [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=268}}\n\nApproached through the primordialist perspective, the example of seeing the mobilization of a foreign military force on the nation's borders may provoke members of a national group to unify and mobilize themselves in response.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=271}} There are proximate environments where individuals identify nonimmediate real or imagined situations in combination with immediate situations that make individuals confront a common situation of both subjective and objective components that affect their decisions.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}} As such proximate environments cause people to make decisions based on existing situations and anticipated situations.{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=272}}\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Nationalist and liberal pressure led to the [[Revolutions of 1848|European revolutions of 1848]]]]\n\nCritics argue that primordial models relying on evolutionary psychology are based not on historical evidence but on assumptions of unobserved changes over thousands of years and assume stable genetic composition of the population living in a specific area, and are incapable of handling the contingencies that characterize every known historical process. Robert Hislope argues:\n:the articulation of cultural evolutionary theory represents theoretical progress over sociobiology, but its explanatory payoff remains limited due to the role of contingency in human affairs and the significance of non-evolutionary, proximate causal factors. While evolutionary theory undoubtedly elucidates the development of all organic life, it would seem to operate best at macro-levels of analysis, \"distal\" points of explanation, and from the perspective of the long-term. Hence, it is bound to display shortcomings at micro-level events that are highly contingent in nature.<ref>Robert Hislope \"From Ontology to Analogy: Evolutionary Theories and the Explanation of Ethnic Politics: in Patrick James and David Goetze ed.

This civic concept of nationalism is exemplified by [[Ernest Renan]] in his lecture in 1882 \"[[What is a Nation?]]\", where he defined the nation as a \"daily referendum\" (frequently translated \"daily [[plebiscite]]\") dependent on the will of its people to continue living together.<ref name=\"blackwell\"/>\n\nCivic nationalism is normally associated with [[liberal nationalism]], although the two are distinct, and did not always coincide. On the one hand, until the late 19th and early 20th century adherents to anti-Enlightenment movements such as French [[Legitimism]] or Spanish [[Carlism]] often rejected the liberal, national unitary state, yet identified themselves not with an ethnic nation but with a non-national dynasty and regional feudal privileges. Xenophobic movements in long-established Western European states indeed often took a 'civic national' form, rejecting a given group's ability to assimilate with the nation due to its belonging to a cross-border community (Irish Catholics in Britain, Ashkenazic Jews in France). On the other hand, while subnational separatist movements were commonly associated with ethnic nationalism, this was not always so, and such nationalists as the [[Corsican Republic]], [[United Irishmen]], [[Breton Federalist League]] or [[Catalan Republican Party]] could combine a rejection of the unitary civic-national state with a belief in liberal universalism.\n\nLiberal nationalism is kind of non-[[xenophobic]] nationalism that is claimed to be compatible with [[liberal values]] of [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Egalitarianism|equality]], and [[individual rights]].<ref>Tamir, Yael. 1993.

Civic nationalism is correlated with long-established states whose dynastic rulers had gradually acquired multiple distinct territories, with little change to boundaries, but which contained historical populations of multiple linguistic and/or confessional backgrounds. Since individuals resident within different parts of the state territory might have little obvious common ground, civic nationalism developed as a way for rulers to both explain a contemporary reason for such heterogeneity and to provide a common purpose  ([[Ernest Renan]]'s classic description in [[What is a Nation?]] (1882) as a voluntary partnership for a common endeavour).  Renan argued that factors such as ethnicity, language, religion, economics, geography, ruling dynasty and historic military deeds were important but not sufficient.

She states:\n:Justifications of nationalism seem to be making a headway in political philosophy. Its proponents contend that liberalism and nationalism are not necessarily mutually exclusive and that they can in fact be made compatible. Liberal nationalists urge one to consider nationalism not as the pathology of modernity but as an answer to its malaise. For them, nationalism is more than an infantile disease, more than \"the measles of mankind\" as Einstein once proclaimed it to be. They argue that nationalism is a legitimate way of understanding one's role and place in life. They strive for a normative justification of nationalism which lies within liberal limits. The main claim which seems to be involved here is that as long as a nationalism abhors violence and propagates liberal rights and equal citizenship for all citizens of its state, its philosophical credentials can be considered to be sound.<ref>\nMonika Kirloskar-Steinbach, \"Liberal Nationalism-A Critique\" ''Trames'' 5#2 (June 2001) pp. 107\u201319 [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qtr-VsOh6X8C&oi=fnd&pg=PA107&dq=%22Liberal+Nationalism-A+Critique%22&ots=p0eE4lJCRl&sig=xeAmTzl7O0L65Ybc3-Le0yis2l0#v=onepage&q=%22Liberal%20Nationalism-A%20Critique%22&f=false online]</ref>\n[[File:2012 UPA March in Kiev.jpg|thumb|Ukrainian nationalists carry portraits of [[Stepan Bandera]] and flags of the [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]]]]\n\n===Creole nationalism===\n{{Main|Creole nationalism}}\n\"Creole nationalism\" refers to the ideology that emerged in independence movements among the creoles (descendants of the colonizers), especially in Latin America in the early 19th century.

[[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], according to Alter and Brown, were examples of integral nationalism.\n\nSome of the qualities that characterize integral nationalism are [[anti-individualism]], [[statism]], radical extremism, and aggressive-expansionist militarism. The term Integral Nationalism often overlaps with fascism, although many natural points of disagreement exist. Integral nationalism arises in countries where a strong military ethos has become entrenched through the independence struggle, when, once independence is achieved, it is believed that a strong military is required to ensure the security and viability of the new state. Also, the success of such a liberation struggle results in feelings of national superiority that may lead to extreme nationalism.\n\nPan-nationalism is unique in that it covers a large area span. Pan-nationalism focuses more on \"clusters\" of ethnic groups. [[Pan-Slavism]] is one example of Pan-nationalism. The goal is to unite all [[Slavic people]] into one country. They did succeed by uniting several [[South Slavs|south Slavic]] people into [[Yugoslavia]] in 1918.<ref>Ivo Banac, ''The National Question in Yugoslavia'' (Cornell University Press, 1984).</ref>\n\n===Anti-colonial nationalism===\n[[File:Crowd demonstrates against Great Britain in Cairo.jpg|thumb|Crowd demonstrates against Britain in [[Cairo]] on 23 October 1951 as tension continued to mount in the dispute between Egypt and Britain over control of the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].]]\nThis form of nationalism came about during the [[decolonization]] of the post war periods. It was a reaction mainly in Africa and Asia against being subdued by foreign powers. It also appeared in the non-Russian territories of the Tsarist empire and later, the USSR, where Ukrainianists and Islamic Marxists condemned Russian Bolshevik rule in their territories as a renewed Russian imperialism.

(see [[Pan-Islamism]])<ref>''[[World Book Encyclopedia]], 2018 ed., s.v. \"Muslims\"</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, [[Marxists]] and other [[socialists]] and [[communists]] (such as [[Rosa Luxemburg]]) produced political analysis that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in Central and Eastern Europe, although a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from [[Vladimir Lenin]] (a communist) to [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national [[self-determination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/cliff/works/1959/rosalux/6-natquest.htm |title=Rosa Luxemburg and the national question |accessdate=2 August 2008|last=Cliff |first=Tony |authorlink=Tony Cliff|year=1959|publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nIn his classic essay on the topic, [[George Orwell]] distinguishes nationalism from patriotism which he defines as devotion to a particular place. More abstractly, nationalism is \"power-hunger tempered by self-deception\".<ref name=NonN>George Orwell, [http://orwell.ru/library/essays/nationalism/english/e_nat Notes on Nationalism], [http://orwell.ru orwell.ru].</ref>\n\nFor Orwell, the nationalist is more likely than not dominated by irrational negative impulses:\n\n{{quote|There are, for example, Trotskyists who have become simply enemies of the U.S.S.R. without developing a corresponding loyalty to any other unit. When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist\u2014that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating\u2014but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.<ref name=NonN />}}\n\nIn the [[Liberalism|liberal]] political tradition there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. The historian [[Lord Acton]] put the case against \"nationalism as insanity\" in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, it places country above moral principles and especially it creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state. However, Acton opposed democracy and was trying to defend the pope from Italian nationalism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lang | first1 = Timothy | year = 2002 | title = Lord Acton and 'the Insanity of Nationality' | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 63 | issue = 1| pages = 129\u201349 | jstor=3654261 | doi=10.2307/3654261}}</ref> Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as [[Michael Walzer]], [[Isaiah Berlin]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] and [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] emphasizing that a liberal society needed to be based in a stable nation state.<ref>Motyl 1:298</ref>\n\nThe [[pacifist]] critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of nationalist movements, the associated [[militarism]], and on conflicts between nations inspired by [[jingoism]] or [[chauvinism]]. National symbols and patriotic assertiveness are in some countries discredited by their historical link with past wars, especially in Germany. British pacifist [[Bertrand Russell]] criticizes nationalism for diminishing the individual's capacity to judge his or her fatherland's foreign policy.<ref>''Russell Speaks His Mind'', 1960.

This is achieved by binding the DOI to [[metadata]] about the object, such as a [[URL]], indicating where the object can be found. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from identifiers such as [[ISBN]]s and [[ISRC]]s which aim only to identify their referents uniquely. The DOI system uses the [[indecs Content Model]] for representing metadata.\n\nThe DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI is supposed to provide a more stable link than simply using its URL.

It also associates [[metadata]] with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the [[Handle System]] and the [[indecs Content Model]] with a social infrastructure.\n\nThe Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on [[open architecture]]s, incorporates [[Computational trust|trust mechanisms]], and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/03/dois-and-their-discontents-1/|title= DOIs and their discontents|last= Timmer|first= John|date= 6 March 2010|work= [[Ars Technica]]|accessdate= 5 March 2013}}</ref> DOI name-resolution may be used with [[OpenURL]] to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request.<ref>{{Cite journal|first1= Susanne|last1= DeRisi|first2= Rebecca|last2= Kennison|first3= Nick|last3= Twyman|title= Editorial: The what and whys of DOIs|journal= [[PLoS Biology]]|volume= 1|issue= 2|page= e57|date= 2003|doi= 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000057|pmid= 14624257|pmc= 261894}} {{open access}}</ref> However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.<ref>{{Cite book|contribution= Open access to scientific and technical information: the state of the art|first= Jack|last= Franklin|title= Open access to scientific and technical information: state of the art and future trends|editor1-first= Herbert|editor1-last= Gr\u00fcttemeier|editor2-first= Barry|editor2-last= Mahon|publisher= IOS Press|date= 2003|page= 74|url= https://books.google.com/?id=2X3gW1lUvN4C&pg=PA74|isbn= 978-1-58603-377-4}}</ref>\n\nThe [[indecs Content Model]] as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects. A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.\n\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF) oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure. The social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as [[GS1]] and [[ISBN]].\n\n==Comparison with other identifier schemes==\nA DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers to material, such as the [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL), in that it identifies an object itself as a [[First class (computing)|first-class entity]], rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] ([[Uniform Resource Name]]) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifierSpecs.html |title=DOI System and Internet Identifier Specifications |publisher=Doi.org |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nA DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]], [[International Standard Recording Code|ISRC]], etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifiers.html |title=DOI System and standard identifier registries |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe DOI system offers persistent, [[Semantic interoperability|semantically-interoperable]] resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as \"identifiers\" doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other \"identifier systems\" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include [[Persistent Uniform Resource Locator]] (PURL), URLs, [[Globally Unique Identifier]]s (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., [[Archival Resource Key|ARK]]).\n\nA DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a [[Uniform Resource Name]] (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.\n\n==Resolution==\nDOI name resolution is provided through the [[Handle System]], developed by [[Corporation for National Research Initiatives]], and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its <code><type></code> field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.\n\nTo resolve a DOI name, it may be input to a DOI resolver, such as [https://doi.org/ doi.org].\n\nAnother approach, which avoids typing or [[cut-and-paste|cutting-and-pasting]] into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as <code><nowiki>https://doi.org/</nowiki></code> (preferred)<ref>{{cite web|author1=International DOI Foundation|title=Resolution|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/3_Resolution.html#3.7.3|website=DOI Handbook|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=7 August 2014}}</ref> or <code><nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/</nowiki></code>, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI <code>10.1000/182</code> can be included in a reference or [[hyperlink]] as <code>https://doi.org/10.1000/182</code>. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal [[hyperlink]]. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.\n\nOther DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include http://hdl.handle.net, and https://doi.pangaea.de/. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io. This service is unusual in that it tries to find a [[paywall|non-paywalled]] version of a title and redirects you to that instead of the publisher's version.<ref name=\"capsh\">{{cite web|url=http://doai.io/|title=DOAI|publisher=CAPSH (Committee for the Accessibility of Publications in Sciences and Humanities)|accessdate=6 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Schonfeld| first = Roger C.| title = Co-opting 'Official' Channels through Infrastructures for Openness |work = The Scholarly Kitchen| accessdate = 17 October 2016| date = 3 March 2016| url = https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/03/03/coopting-official-channels/}}</ref> Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016.<ref name=\"impactstory\">{{cite web| last=Piwowar| first=Heather| title=Introducing oaDOI: resolve a DOI straight to OA |url=http://blog.impactstory.org/introducting-oadoi/ |date= 25 October 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2017 }}</ref> While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as [[BASE (search engine)|BASE]] (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).<ref name=\"capsh\"/><ref name=\"impactstory\"/>\n\nAn alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for [[Web browser|browser]]s, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.doi.org/tools.html|title=DOI System Tools}}</ref> which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. For example. the [https://www.handle.net/firefox_hdlclient.html CNRI Handle Extension for Firefox], enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like <code>hdl:4263537/4000</code> or <code>doi:10.1000/1</code> directly in the [[Firefox]] browser, using the native Handle System protocol. This plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, [[mail reader]], or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.\n\n==IDF organizational structure==\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF), a non-profit organisation created in 1998, is the governance body of the DOI system.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/7_IDF.html#7.5 |title=DOI Handbook |chapter=Chapter 7: The International DOI Foundation |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> It safeguards all [[intellectual property|intellectual property rights]] relating to the DOI system, manages common operational features, and supports the development and promotion of the DOI system. The IDF ensures that any improvements made to the DOI system (including creation, maintenance, registration, resolution and policymaking of DOI names) are available to any DOI registrant. It also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the IDF on users of the DOI system.\n\nThe IDF is controlled by a Board elected by the members of the Foundation, with an appointed Managing Agent who is responsible for co-ordinating and planning its activities. Membership is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic publishing and related enabling technologies. The IDF holds annual open meetings on the topics of DOI and related issues.\n\nRegistration agencies, appointed by the IDF, provide services to DOI registrants: they allocate DOI prefixes, register DOI names, and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system, to cooperate with the IDF in the development of the DOI system as a whole, and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community. A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation. The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation (of which the IDF is a board member), and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top-level <code>10</code> prefix.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dona.net/mpa/|title=DONA Foundation Multi-Primary Administrators|access-date=7 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114120514/https://dona.net/mpa/|archive-date=14 January 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRegistration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new DOI name; parts of these fees are used to support the IDF. The DOI system overall, through the IDF, operates on a [[not-for-profit]] cost recovery basis.\n\n==Standardization==\nThe DOI system is an international standard developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in its technical committee on identification and description, TC46/SC9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1561 |title=Digital object identifier (DOI) becomes an ISO standard |publisher=iso.org |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=10 May 2012}}</ref> The Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 26324, Information and documentation \u2013 Digital Object Identifier System met the ISO requirements for approval.

It requires an additional layer of administration for defining DOI as a URN namespace (the string {{code|urn:doi:10.1000/1}} rather than the simpler {{code|doi:10.1000/1}}) and an additional step of unnecessary redirection to access the resolution service, already achieved through either http proxy or native resolution.

This is achieved by binding the DOI to [[metadata]] about the object, such as a [[URL]], indicating where the object can be found. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from identifiers such as [[ISBN]]s and [[ISRC]]s which aim only to identify their referents uniquely. The DOI system uses the [[indecs Content Model]] for representing metadata.\n\nThe DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI is supposed to provide a more stable link than simply using its URL. But every time a URL changes, the publisher has to update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL.<ref>{{cite book|author= Witten, Ian H.|author2= David Bainbridge|author3= David M.

It also associates [[metadata]] with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the [[Handle System]] and the [[indecs Content Model]] with a social infrastructure.\n\nThe Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on [[open architecture]]s, incorporates [[Computational trust|trust mechanisms]], and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/03/dois-and-their-discontents-1/|title= DOIs and their discontents|last= Timmer|first= John|date= 6 March 2010|work= [[Ars Technica]]|accessdate= 5 March 2013}}</ref> DOI name-resolution may be used with [[OpenURL]] to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request.<ref>{{Cite journal|first1= Susanne|last1= DeRisi|first2= Rebecca|last2= Kennison|first3= Nick|last3= Twyman|title= Editorial: The what and whys of DOIs|journal= [[PLoS Biology]]|volume= 1|issue= 2|page= e57|date= 2003|doi= 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000057|pmid= 14624257|pmc= 261894}} {{open access}}</ref> However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.<ref>{{Cite book|contribution= Open access to scientific and technical information: the state of the art|first= Jack|last= Franklin|title= Open access to scientific and technical information: state of the art and future trends|editor1-first= Herbert|editor1-last= Gr\u00fcttemeier|editor2-first= Barry|editor2-last= Mahon|publisher= IOS Press|date= 2003|page= 74|url= https://books.google.com/?id=2X3gW1lUvN4C&pg=PA74|isbn= 978-1-58603-377-4}}</ref>\n\nThe [[indecs Content Model]] as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects. A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.\n\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF) oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure. The social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as [[GS1]] and [[ISBN]].\n\n==Comparison with other identifier schemes==\nA DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers to material, such as the [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL), in that it identifies an object itself as a [[First class (computing)|first-class entity]], rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] ([[Uniform Resource Name]]) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifierSpecs.html |title=DOI System and Internet Identifier Specifications |publisher=Doi.org |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nA DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]], [[International Standard Recording Code|ISRC]], etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifiers.html |title=DOI System and standard identifier registries |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe DOI system offers persistent, [[Semantic interoperability|semantically-interoperable]] resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as \"identifiers\" doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other \"identifier systems\" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include [[Persistent Uniform Resource Locator]] (PURL), URLs, [[Globally Unique Identifier]]s (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., [[Archival Resource Key|ARK]]).\n\nA DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a [[Uniform Resource Name]] (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.\n\n==Resolution==\nDOI name resolution is provided through the [[Handle System]], developed by [[Corporation for National Research Initiatives]], and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its <code><type></code> field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.\n\nTo resolve a DOI name, it may be input to a DOI resolver, such as [https://doi.org/ doi.org].\n\nAnother approach, which avoids typing or [[cut-and-paste|cutting-and-pasting]] into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as <code><nowiki>https://doi.org/</nowiki></code> (preferred)<ref>{{cite web|author1=International DOI Foundation|title=Resolution|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/3_Resolution.html#3.7.3|website=DOI Handbook|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=7 August 2014}}</ref> or <code><nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/</nowiki></code>, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI <code>10.1000/182</code> can be included in a reference or [[hyperlink]] as <code>https://doi.org/10.1000/182</code>. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal [[hyperlink]]. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.\n\nOther DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include http://hdl.handle.net, and https://doi.pangaea.de/. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io. This service is unusual in that it tries to find a [[paywall|non-paywalled]] version of a title and redirects you to that instead of the publisher's version.<ref name=\"capsh\">{{cite web|url=http://doai.io/|title=DOAI|publisher=CAPSH (Committee for the Accessibility of Publications in Sciences and Humanities)|accessdate=6 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Schonfeld| first = Roger C.| title = Co-opting 'Official' Channels through Infrastructures for Openness |work = The Scholarly Kitchen| accessdate = 17 October 2016| date = 3 March 2016| url = https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/03/03/coopting-official-channels/}}</ref> Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016.<ref name=\"impactstory\">{{cite web| last=Piwowar| first=Heather| title=Introducing oaDOI: resolve a DOI straight to OA |url=http://blog.impactstory.org/introducting-oadoi/ |date= 25 October 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2017 }}</ref> While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as [[BASE (search engine)|BASE]] (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).<ref name=\"capsh\"/><ref name=\"impactstory\"/>\n\nAn alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for [[Web browser|browser]]s, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.doi.org/tools.html|title=DOI System Tools}}</ref> which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. For example. the [https://www.handle.net/firefox_hdlclient.html CNRI Handle Extension for Firefox], enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like <code>hdl:4263537/4000</code> or <code>doi:10.1000/1</code> directly in the [[Firefox]] browser, using the native Handle System protocol. This plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, [[mail reader]], or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.\n\n==IDF organizational structure==\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF), a non-profit organisation created in 1998, is the governance body of the DOI system.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/7_IDF.html#7.5 |title=DOI Handbook |chapter=Chapter 7: The International DOI Foundation |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> It safeguards all [[intellectual property|intellectual property rights]] relating to the DOI system, manages common operational features, and supports the development and promotion of the DOI system. The IDF ensures that any improvements made to the DOI system (including creation, maintenance, registration, resolution and policymaking of DOI names) are available to any DOI registrant. It also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the IDF on users of the DOI system.\n\nThe IDF is controlled by a Board elected by the members of the Foundation, with an appointed Managing Agent who is responsible for co-ordinating and planning its activities. Membership is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic publishing and related enabling technologies. The IDF holds annual open meetings on the topics of DOI and related issues.\n\nRegistration agencies, appointed by the IDF, provide services to DOI registrants: they allocate DOI prefixes, register DOI names, and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system, to cooperate with the IDF in the development of the DOI system as a whole, and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community. A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation. The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation (of which the IDF is a board member), and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top-level <code>10</code> prefix.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dona.net/mpa/|title=DONA Foundation Multi-Primary Administrators|access-date=7 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114120514/https://dona.net/mpa/|archive-date=14 January 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRegistration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new DOI name; parts of these fees are used to support the IDF. The DOI system overall, through the IDF, operates on a [[not-for-profit]] cost recovery basis.\n\n==Standardization==\nThe DOI system is an international standard developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in its technical committee on identification and description, TC46/SC9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1561 |title=Digital object identifier (DOI) becomes an ISO standard |publisher=iso.org |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=10 May 2012}}</ref> The Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 26324, Information and documentation \u2013 Digital Object Identifier System met the ISO requirements for approval.

However no such widely deployed RDS schemes currently exist.... DOI is not registered as a URN namespace, despite fulfilling all the functional requirements, since URN registration appears to offer no advantage to the DOI System. It requires an additional layer of administration for defining DOI as a URN namespace (the string {{code|urn:doi:10.1000/1}} rather than the simpler {{code|doi:10.1000/1}}) and an additional step of unnecessary redirection to access the resolution service, already achieved through either http proxy or native resolution. If RDS mechanisms supporting URN specifications become widely available, DOI will be registered as a URN.|International DOI Foundation|Factsheet: DOI System and Internet Identifier Specifications{{sfnp|International DOI Foundation|2012}}}}\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[arXiv]]\n* [[Bibcode]]\n* [[DataCite]]\n* [[Digital identity]]\n* [[Metadata standards]]\n* [[Object identifier]]\n* [[ORCID]]\n* [[PMID]]\n* [[Publisher Item Identifier]] (PII)\n* [[Permalink]]\n* [[Scientific literature]]\n* [[Universally Unique Identifier]] (UUID)\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikidata property|P356}}\n* {{official website|https://www.doi.org/}}\n* [http://shortdoi.org Short DOI] \u2013 DOI Foundation service for converting long DOIs to shorter equivalents\n* [https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifierSpecs.html Factsheet: DOI System and Internet Identifier Specifications]\n* [http://search.crossref.org/ CrossRef DOI lookup]\n\n{{Audiovisual works|state=uncollapsed}}\n{{ISO standards}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Digital Object Identifier}}\n[[Category:Academic publishing]]\n[[Category:Electronic documents]]\n[[Category:Identifiers]]\n[[Category:Index (publishing)]]\n", "name_user": "78.101.183.205", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier"}
