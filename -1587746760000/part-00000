Also in this period, Porsgrunn was considered the cultural centre of Norway. On the ecclesiastical side, Porsgrunn was separated from the ancient rural parishes of [[Eidanger]], [[Solum, Norway|Solum]], and [[Gjerpen]] in [[1764 in Norway|1764]] to become a [[prestegjeld]] with its own minister.  Churches within the Porsgrunn prestegjeld include [[\u00d8stre Porsgrunn Church]] and [[Vestre Porsgrunn Church]].  The city was granted limited city status in [[1807 in Norway|1807]], but this was expanded to full city status in 1842.\n\nPorsgrunn was once home to ''[[Skomv\u00e6r (barque)|Skomv\u00e6r]]'', the country's largest [[sailing ship]].  In 1985, the sculpture ''[[Amphitrite, the wave and the sea birds]]'' was unveiled in Porsgrunn.  The sculpture, which is one of [[J\u00f8rleif Uthaug]]'s best known works, has a nautical theme in honor of Porsgrunn's maritime history.\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:The Porsgrunn River.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The river flowing through the town]]\nPorsgrunn borders the municipalities of [[Skien]] and [[Siljan, Norway|Siljan]] to the north, [[Bamble]] in the west, and [[Larvik]] in the east. It is part of a cluster of municipalities in southern [[Telemark]] that constitute the [[Grenland]] area of Norway. The city is situated near [[Gunneklevfjord]], and at the mouth of the river ''[[Telemarksvassdraget]]'' or Porsgrunn River (''Porsgrunnselva'').

The city was granted limited city status in [[1807 in Norway|1807]], but this was expanded to full city status in 1842.\n\nPorsgrunn was once home to ''[[Skomv\u00e6r (barque)|Skomv\u00e6r]]'', the country's largest [[sailing ship]].  In 1985, the sculpture ''[[Amphitrite, the wave and the sea birds]]'' was unveiled in Porsgrunn.

Later in the war, the department was instrumental in the creation of the [[Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation]] (commonly known as FIDO) that cleared runways of [[fog]] allowing the landing of aircraft returning from [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing raids over Germany]] in poor visibility; and [[Operation Pluto]] which installed prefabricated fuel pipelines between England and France soon after the Allied [[Invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944.{{sfn|PLUTO \u2013 Combined Operations}}\n\n== Inception ==\n[[File:Maurice Hankey.jpg|thumb|right|Maurice Hankey, 1921]]\n\nAt the beginning of [[World War II]], in September 1939, there was little fighting in the West until the German invasion of France and the [[low countries]] in May 1940. Following the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] and the withdrawal of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) from [[Operation Dynamo|the beaches at Dunkirk]] in June 1940, Britain was [[Operation Sealion|threatened with invasion]] by [[History of Germany during World War II|German armed forces in 1940 and 1941]].{{sfn|NA WO 199/1433}}\n\nIn response to this threat of invasion, the British sought to expand the [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Air Force]], and Army and to replace the equipment that had been left behind at Dunkirk. Also, to supplement the regular armed services with volunteer organisations such as the part-time soldiers in the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]]. With many types of equipment in short supply, there were frantic efforts to develop new weapons \u2013 particularly those that did not require scarce materials.{{sfn|NA WO 199/1433}}\n\nAlthough oil imports from the Middle East had stopped and most oil for Britain came from the United States, there was at this time no shortage of oil: supplies originally intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities and there were full tankers kept waiting in American ports.{{sfn|NA PREM 3/264}}{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=27}} The amount of petrol allocated for civilian use was strictly rationed and pleasure motoring was strongly discouraged. This was not, at least initially, because of a shortage of petrol but because it might lead to large congregations of well-fuelled vehicles at popular places.{{sfn|Graves|1943|p=74}}\n\nIn the event of an invasion, the British would be faced with the problem of destroying this embarrassment of riches lest it should prove of use to the enemy (as it had in France{{sfn|Ironside|1962|loc = Entry: 24 May 1940}}). By mid-June, as a basic anti-invasion precaution, wayside [[petrol stations]] near the coast had been emptied, or at least had their pumps disabled, and garages everywhere were required to have a plan to prevent their stocks being of use to the invader.<ref>If The Invader Comes. Ministry of Information. 1940, rule IV.</ref>\n\nOn 29 May 1940, as the evacuation of the BEF was in progress, [[Maurice Hankey]] then a cabinet [[minister without portfolio]], joined the Ministerial Committee on Civil Defence (CDC) chaired by [[Sir John Anderson]], the [[Home Secretary|Secretary of State for the Home Office]] and [[Ministry of Home Security|Home Security]].{{sfn|Roskill|1974|p=471}} Among many ideas, Hankey \"brought out of his stable a hobby horse which he had ridden very hard in the 1914\u201318 war \u2013 namely the use of burning oil for defensive purposes.\"{{sfn|Roskill|1974|p=472}} Hankey believed that oil should not just be denied to an invader, but used to impede him.{{sfn|Roskill|1974|p=472}} Towards the end of June Hankey brought his scheme up at a meeting of the Oil Control Board and produced for Commander-in-Chief Home Forces [[Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside|Edmund Ironside]] extracts of his paper on experiments with oil in the First World War.{{sfn|Roskill|1974|p=472}} On 5 June, Churchill authorised [[Geoffrey Lloyd, Baron Geoffrey-Lloyd|Geoffrey Lloyd]], the [[Secretary for Petroleum]] to press ahead with experiments, with Hankey taking the matter under his general supervision.{{sfn|Roskill|1974|p=472}}\n\n== Donald Banks ==\n[[Donald Banks]] (1891\u20131975) had served with distinction in World War I winning the DSO and MC. He joined the civil service and in 1934 he was made Director-General of the Post Office,{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=4}}{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=4}} he then moved to the Air Ministry and served there as Permanent Under Secretary from 1936\u201338.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=4}}{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=5}} Due to overwork, Banks was given lighter duties, including a mission to Australia to advise on aircraft production and a job at the [[Import Duties Advisory Committee]].{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=5}} During this period, Banks had remained on the rolls of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army Reserve of Officers]]. When hostilities broke out in September 1939, the advisory committee was abolished and he was free to serve in the armed forces.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=9}}\n\nBanks was soon posted as [[air attach\u00e9]] to the [[quartermaster general]] of [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]] \u2013 a first line division of the Territorial Army.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=6}} Banks got on well with his commander, [[Giffard LeQuesne Martel]]. Banks admired his leadership and his enthusiasm for experimentation and improvisation.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=10}} In October 1939, the division was sent to the [[Cotswold]]s and in January 1940 it was moved to France.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=6}}\n\nWhen Germany attacked in May, the division was heavily involved in [[Battle of Arras (1940)|the fighting around Arras]] and was later withdrawn to the coast. Banks later recalled looking out to sea from a cliff top and seeing \"an awe-inspiring sight [...] A few miles away an oil tanker had been bombed or had struck a mine. Masses of the blackest smoke pillared up into a gigantic pall in the sky while in the vast lake of fire, spreading it seemed for miles on the water a flame blazed and leapt like an angry volcano [...] I was often to recall that scene in subsequent days of Flame Warfare\".{{sfn|Banks|1946|pp=18\u201319}} The division was [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated to England]].\n\nEarly in July 1940, [[Donald Banks|Banks]] was summoned to the presence of [[Geoffrey Lloyd, Baron Geoffrey-Lloyd|Geoffrey Lloyd]], who explained the vision that he and Hankey shared: \"Flame all across Britain\" he said, \"ringing the coasts, spurting from the hedges and rolling down the hills. We will burn the invader back into the sea.\"{{efn|Lloyd quoted by Banks.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=27}}}}\n\nConsidering Lloyd's ideas over the next few days Banks consulted with other soldiers, he found both professional scepticism and enthusiasm. Banks, a man who said he preferred the prospect of real fighting over [[Narcissistic leadership|Whitehall warfare]], was not himself keen and his first instinct was to suggest that petroleum weapons should be developed locally.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=28}} Lloyd would have none of it and Banks was ordered to report to him for special duties. On 9 July, cutting through red tape, the Petroleum Warfare Department was created.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=29}}\n\nThe Petroleum Warfare Department started on 9 July 1940 in three small rooms. They were independently administered and financed with a few staff entirely lacking in technical knowledge.{{sfn|Banks|1946|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n== Flame traps ==\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Hankey and Lloyd were not alone in their interest in the development of petroleum warfare weapons; encouragement came from the highest quarters. In August a note from the Chief Engineer's office at GHQ Home Forces read: \"The PM is personally interested in it. It is something which can be provided without any adverse effect on the production of other equipment or on our War effort generally. It is unlikely that we shall have enough A/T weapons to cover all our road blocks for many months, if ever. These flame traps do at least give the Home Guard a sporting chance of frying a few Germans.\"{{sfn|NA WO 199/1433}}\n| width = 25%\n| align = right\n}}\n\nPWD took inspiration from events that happened during the retreat to Dunkirk in June 1940.{{sfn|Times 4 June 1945}} One example occurred when [[Boulogne]] was attacked in the early hours of 23 May and the road to [[Calais]] was cut.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=43}} In the defence of Boulogne, a group of [[Pioneer (military)|pioneers]] under [[Donald John Dean|Lieutenant-Colonel Donald Dean VC]], had improvised a road block made of vehicles and piles of furniture from bombed-out houses. An approaching tank began to push its way over the obstruction, as Dean wrote:\n\n{{cquote|We were prepared for this&nbsp;... I had some lorry petrol tanks punctured with a pick, the tank being unable to shell us during its crushing climb, and we set fire to the lot. A sheet of flame went up, and the tank backed hastily off&nbsp;... Our roadblock burned for quite a while, and allowed for a further block to be made under cover of smoke.{{efn|Lieutenant-Colonel Donald Dean quoted by Sebag-Montefiore.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2007|p=199}} }} }}\n\nThe newly formed department quickly made arrangements for some practical experiments at [[Dumpton Gap]] in Kent. These were the source of some excitement for witnesses, who included the pilots of enemy planes. Many of the first ideas to be tried proved fruitless, but experience quickly led to the development of the first practical weapon: the static flame trap.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=32}}\n\n=== Static flame trap ===\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = I lived in Longniddry from 1927 until my wife and I moved [away] ... twenty years ago. [...] It was on a platform high up in the trees opposite a dip in the road between the two old telegraph poles. My recollection is that the tank was as high as the telegraph poles. A vertical pipe from the tank was connected to a horizontal pipe fixed to the top of the wall.  This pipe had a line of small holes along its length. Opening a valve inside the wood allowed the petrol to escape under a considerable pressure head.\n\nI only saw this Flamme operated once. Army personnel for the Home Guard laid on a demonstration. The petrol valve was opened and created a huge spray, which reached the opposite side of the road.  I think the original idea was that a limited amount of petrol would be released, but the valve remained open.  An army Sergeant with a [[Very pistol]] fired a round (from the top of the Goods Yard) into the pool of petrol in the road dip, while fuel was still coming out at force.\n\nIt created one of the fiercest of fires I have seen, destroying the grass banks, the railway sleeper fence, scorched the telegraph poles and burned the surface off the road.  Very effective! This little episode (about 1940-41) was never repeated!{{efn|William J. Watt quoted by Jackson and Haire.{{sfn|Jackson|Haire|2015}} }}\n| width = 25%\n| align = right\n}}\n\n[[File:Flame Fougasse Tank, Carfrae (geograph 3996531).jpg|thumb|right|upright|An extant static flame trap tank, near [[Gifford, East Lothian]], Scotland.{{sfn|Jackson|Haire|2015}}]]\n\nA static flame trap allowed a length of road, typically {{convert|60|to|150|ft|m|abbr=off}}, to be covered in flame and smoke at a moment's notice.{{sfn|NA SUPP 15/29}} The weapon was a simple arrangement of perforated pipes placed alongside a road.{{sfn|McKinstry|2014|p=32}} The pipes were steel, one to two inches in diameter and drilled with 1/8th inch holes at angles carefully calculated to cover the road evenly.{{sfn|NA SUPP 15/29}} The perforated pipes were connected to larger pipes that led to a tank of fuel in a raised position. The fuel mixture was 25% petrol and 75% [[Fuel oil|gas-oil]] that was contrived to be of no use as motor vehicle fuel should it be captured. All that was required to trigger the weapon was to open a valve and for a [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guardsman]] to throw in a [[Molotov cocktail]] creating an inferno. The ideal location for the trap was a place where vehicles could not easily escape, such as a steep-sided [[sunken road]]. Some trouble was taken with camouflage: pipes could be hidden in gutters or disguised as handrails; others were simply left as innocent looking plumbing.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=32}}\n\nAll the required pipes and valves could be obtained from the gas and water industries with little modification required beyond drilling a few holes. In general, gravity was all that was required to provide sufficient pressure for the fountains of oil, but where necessary pumps were provided.{{sfn|NA SUPP 15/29}}\n\nLater versions were a little more sophisticated; remote ignition could be achieved in a variety of ways. In one system, called the Birch Igniter, the pressure of the oil at the end of the pipe would squeeze [[glycerine]] from a rubber bulb; the glycerine would fall onto a container of [[potassium permanganate]], which would then ignite spontaneously. Another method was to run a pair of small rubber tubes, down one of which would be passed [[acetylene]] and the other [[chlorine]]; when, at the far end, these two gasses were allowed to mix, there would be a spontaneous ignition. This system had the advantage that it could be turned on and off repeatedly.{{sfn|NA SUPP 15/29}} The development of the [[flame fougasse]] (see below) provided a method of remote electrical ignition that could only be used once, but was virtually instantaneous.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=32}}\n\nSome 200 static flame traps were installed, mainly by the employees of oil companies whose services were placed at the disposal of the government.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=33}}\n\n=== Mobile flame traps ===\n\nIn addition to the static flame traps, mobile units were created. The main design used an otherwise redundant {{convert|200|-|300|impgal|l|adj=on}} tank mounted on the back of a 30 cwt lorry, just behind the cabin. In the middle of the remaining space was a petrol-driven pump and either side of this was stored {{convert|75|ft|m|abbr=off}} of armoured rubber hose. Two nozzles were provided with a primitive sight and with spikes for pushing into the ground. Gas tubes for chlorine and acetylene gas were provided for ignition. The resulting jets of flame had a range of {{convert|60|-|70|ft|m}}.{{sfn|NA SUPP 15/29}}\n\nBecause there was a shortage of pumps \u2013 they were badly needed for fighting fires started by bombing \u2013 a simpler type of mobile flame trap was also designed. This consisted of a number of {{convert|12|in|cm|adj=on|sigfig=1}} diameter pipes welded shut to make a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} long cylindrical drum which was filled with {{convert|43|impgal|l}} of gasoline-oil mixture and pressurised with an inert gas. A number of these cylinders could be transported on the back of a vehicle and, at a weight of just under {{convert|1000|lb|kg}}, could be deployed reasonably quickly wherever an ambush was required. The cylinders would be placed at intervals along a road each with a short length of hose leading to a nozzle secured by ground spikes. Flow was initiated by a pull-string that opened a valve and ignition was provided by [[Molotov cocktail]]s.{{sfn|NA SUPP 15/29}}\n\n=== Flame fougasse ===\n[[File:D 024854 new.jpg|thumb|right|A demonstration of 'Fougasse', somewhere in Britain. A car is surrounded in flames and a huge cloud of smoke. c1940.]]\n\n{{main|Flame fougasse}}\n\nThe Petroleum Warfare Department soon received the assistance of Henry Newton{{efn|See [[Newton 6-inch Mortar]] and ''Weaponry, Inventions and Improvements by Captain H Newton during the First World War''.{{sfn|IWM 11770}} }} and [[William Howard Livens]], both known for designing mortars during the First World War.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=53}}\n\nDuring the First World War, Livens had developed a number of chemical warfare and flame throwing weapons. His best-known invention was the [[Livens Projector]]: a simple mortar that could throw a projectile containing about {{convert|30|lb|kg|abbr=off}} of explosives, incendiary oil or, most commonly, poisonous [[phosgene]] gas. The great advantage of the Livens Projector was that it was cheap, this allowed hundreds, and on occasions thousands, to be set up and then fired simultaneously, catching the enemy by surprise.{{sfn|NA MUN 5}}{{sfn|Palazzo|2002|p=103}} Both Livens and Newton experimented with field expedient versions of the Livens Projector using commercially available five gallon drums and tubes.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=53}} Newton experimented with firing milk bottles filled with phosphorus using a rifle. None of these experiments were taken forward.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=53}}\n\nOne of Livens' PWD demonstrations, probably first seen about mid-July at [[Dumpton Gap]],{{efn|Livens had briefly experimented with a similar weapons during the First World War.{{sfn|Foulkes|2001|p=167}} }} was particularly promising. A barrel of oil was blown up on the beach; Lloyd was said to have been particularly impressed when he observed a party of high-ranking officers witnessing a test from the top of a cliff making \"an instantaneous and precipitate movement to the rear\".{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=33}} The work was dangerous, Livens and Banks were experimenting with five-gallon drums in the shingle at [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] when a [[short circuit]] triggered several weapons. By good fortune, the battery of drums where the party was standing failed to go off.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=34}}\n\nThe experiments led to a particularly promising arrangement: a forty-gallon [[Drum (container)|steel drum]]{{efn|Although the standard capacity is 44 imperial gallons (55 US gallons), historical records generally refer to 40-gallon drums and sometimes 50-gallon drums apparently interchangeably.}} buried in an earthen bank with just the round front end exposed. At the back of the drum was an explosive which when triggered ruptured the drum and shot a jet of flame about {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|30|yd|m}} long.{{sfn|Barrel Flame Traps|1942|p=6}} The design was reminiscent of a weapon dating from late medieval times called a [[fougasse (weapon)|fougasse]]: a hollow in which was placed a barrel of gunpowder covered by rocks, the explosives to be detonated by a fuse at an opportune moment. Livens' new weapon was duly dubbed the flame fougasse.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=34}} The flame fougasse was demonstrated to [[Clement Attlee]], [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]] and [[Claude Liardet|General Liardet]] on 20 July 1940.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=34}}{{sfn|IWM Film MGH 6799|loc=time: 1:02}}\n\nA variant of the flame fougasse called the ''demi-gass'' was a fougasse barrel placed horizontally in the open with an explosive charge underneath that would rupture the barrel and flip it over towards the target.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=36}}{{sfn|IWM Film MGH 6799|loc=time: 3:18}} Another variant was the ''hedge hopper'', a fougasse barrel on its end with an explosive charge underneath that would send it bounding over a hedge or wall; this made the hedge hopper particularly easy to conceal.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=36}}{{sfn|IWM Film WPN 220|loc=time: 2:08}}{{sfn|IWM Film MGH 6799|loc=time: 2:57}} A further variant of the hedge hopper idea was devised for [[St. Margarets Bay, Kent|St Margaret's Bay]] where the barrels would be sent rolling over the cliff edge.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=38}}\n\nIn all some 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were distributed of which the great majority were installed in one of 7,000 batteries mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=38}} Some barrels were held in reserve while others were deployed at storage sites to destroy [[Oil depot|fuel depots]] at short notice. The size of a battery varied from just one drum to as many as fourteen; a four barrel battery was the most common installation and the recommended minimum. Where possible, half the barrels in a battery were to contain the 40/60 mixture and half the sticky 5B mixture.{{sfn|NA WO 199/1433}}\n\n== Troubled Waters ==\n=== Operation Lucid ===\n[[File:War Nawab 1919.jpg|right|thumb|[[Royal Fleet Auxiliary|RFA]] ''War Nawab'', one of the ships involved in Operation Lucid.]]\n\n{{main|Operation Lucid}}\n\nA series of experiments investigated the possibility of burning the invader's barges before they could reach the English shore. The first idea was simply to explode a vessel filled with oil, and this was tried at [[Maplin Sands]] where a Thames oil tanker, ''Suffolk'', with 50 tonnes of petroleum was blown up in shallow water.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=48}} Another idea developed was that the oil should be held in place on the water by a trough formed from [[coir]] matting. A machine formed the trough from a flat mat as it was paid out over the stern of a ship. Trials with the ''Ben Hann'' produced a flaming ribbon 880 yards long and 6 feet wide (800 m \u00d7 2 m) that could be towed at four knots.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=48}} Neither of these experiments were carried forward to produce workable defences.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=48}}\n\nThe ''Suffolk'' did, however, provide a trial run for an even more ambitious idea: the [[invasion barge]]s would be burned even before they left port.

This was the source of a widespread rumour that the Germans had attempted an invasion and had suffered very heavy losses either by drowning or by being burnt in patches of sea covered with flaming oil.

The mission of the SOE was to encourage and facilitate espionage and sabotage behind enemy lines or, as Churchill put, it: to \"set Europe ablaze\". Among those present at the first summit meeting of SOE on 1 July 1940 were Lord [[Hankey]], [[Geoffrey Lloyd, Baron Geoffrey-Lloyd|Geoffrey Lloyd]] and [[Desmond Morton (civil servant)|Desmond Morton]] \u2013 people who would be instrumental in the formation of the Petroleum Warfare Department just a few days later.{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=44}}\n\nDepartment EH and section D later became SO1 and SO2 of the SOE.<ref>{{cite web\n | url        = http://www.psywar.org/psywar/reproductions/day.pdf\n | format     = PDF\n | title      = The Day is Coming!

Writer [[James Hayward]] has made an extensive study of this curious story; in ''The Bodies on the Beach'', Hayward makes a compelling case for the view that the burning seas work was driven substantially by the needs of propaganda and was a sophisticated bluff that became Britain's first major propaganda success of the war. Writing just after the war, Banks admitted \"Perhaps the greatest contribution from all these variegated efforts was in building up the great propaganda story of the Flame Defence of Britain which swept the Continent of Europe in 1940.\"{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=57}}\n\nThe details of the story indicated the invention of a bomb that would spread a thin film of volatile liquid on the surface of the water and then ignite it. This rumour was whispered into attentive ears in neutral cities such as [[Stockholm]], Lisbon, [[Madrid]], [[Cairo]], [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], New York and other places,{{sfn|Baker White|1955|p=18}} probably around late July or early August 1940. The burning seas rumour appealed to the dark imaginations of both friend and foe. Soon, interrogation of captured [[Luftwaffe]] pilots revealed that the rumour had become common knowledge.{{sfn|Baker White|1955|p=19}}\n\nGerman armed forces began experimenting with burning floating oil. On 18 August they ignited 100 tons of floating oil \u2013 it burned for 20 minutes producing heat and copious smoke \u2013 this was almost a week before the first successful British ignition.{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=20}}\n\nIn Europe, the burning seas story became embellished to the point where the story included a German invasion attempt thwarted by the ignition of oil on water. American war correspondent [[William Lawrence Shirer]] (1904\u20131993) was based in [[Berlin]] at the time, but in mid-September he visited the city of [[Geneva]] in Switzerland.\n\n{{cquote|News coming over the near-by border of France is that the Germans have attempted a landing in Britain, but that it has been repulsed with heavy German losses. Must take this report with a grain of salt.{{sfn|Shirer|1961|loc=Entry for 16 September 1940}} }}\n\nOn the evening of the following day Shirer arrived back in Berlin:\n\n{{cquote|I noticed several lightly wounded soldiers, mostly airmen, getting off a special car which had been attached to our train. From their bandages, the wounds looked like burns. I noticed also the longest Red Cross train I've ever seen. It stretched from the station for half a mile to beyond the bridge over the [[Landwehr Canal]]. [...] I wondered where so many wounded could have come from, as the armies in the west stopped fighting three months ago. As there were only a few porters I had to wait some time on the platform and picked up a conversation with a railway workman. He said most of the men taken from the hospital train were suffering from burns.\n\nCan it be that the tales I heard in Geneva had some truth in them after all? The stories there were that either in attempted German raids with sizable landing-parties on the English coast or in rehearsals with boats and barges off the French coast the British had given the Germans a bad pummelling. The reports reaching Switzerland from France were that many German barges and ships had been destroyed and a considerable number of German troops drowned; also that the British used a new type of wireless-directed torpedo (a Swiss invention, the Swiss said) which spread ignited oil on the water and burned the barges. Those cases of burns at the station this morning bear looking into.{{sfn|Shirer|1961|loc=Entry for 18 September 1940}} }}\n\nThe following day, Shirer heard about further train loads of wounded soldiers. A plausible explanation for these wounded is that they were hurt in RAF bombing raids on ports of embarkation. Such raids were certainly going on though it seems they were generally fairly ineffective and no records of significant German casualties have been turned up.{{sfn|Hayward|1994|p=95}} It seems likely that the rumour machine inflated light casualties to proportions of strategic consequence.\n\nThe British were getting better organised. A system was set up to collect suggestions for Inspired Rumours, these suggestions, which became known as ''SIBS'' (from the [[Latin]] ''sibilare'', to hiss{{sfn|Cull|Culbert|Welch|2003|p=358}}). SIBS, were sifted through at weekly meetings in order that they should present a consistent message and to ensure that ludicrously improbable and inadvertently true rumours were filtered out.{{sfn|NA FO 898/70}} New SIBS included \"small scale attempts at invasion have been made and have been beaten off with devastating losses. In fact none are alive to tell. Thousands of floating German corpses have been washed ashore.\"{{sfn|NA FO 898/70|loc = Inspired rumours weekly report No 12}} and \"The fishing populations of the west coast of Denmark and the south coast of Norway are selling fish but they won\u2019t eat them. The reason is that there are numbers of German corpses on which the fish feed. There have even been cases of shreds of clothing and buttons, etc. being found inside the fish.\"{{sfn|NA FO 898/70|loc = Inspired rumours weekly report No 12}}\n\nThe story of the burning seas was further reinforced. In October, the RAF dropped leaflets containing handy phrases for visitors to the United Kingdom in German, French and Dutch. The phrases included \"the sea smells of petrol here\", \"the sea even burns here\", \"see how well the captain burns\", \"Karl/Willi/Fritz/Johann/Abraham: cremated/drowned/minced by the propellers!\"{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=52}} As Hayward explains, these leaflets were simply building on and reinforcing the rumours of a failed invasion attempt that were being disseminated around the world from late September.{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=47}} The original propaganda was conflated with other events both real and imaginary and the rumours spread. Of course, the German command knew that the stories were untrue; the real targets of the propaganda were the men who might actually be asked to attempt a landing in England. Berlin felt forced officially to deny the rumours:\n\n{{cquote|CHANNEL LOSSES DENIED: Berlin, September 25th (AP) \u2013 Authorised German sources said today that there was no truth in reports that many thousands of bodies of German soldiers were being washed ashore along the English Channel. Such accounts were declared to be an indication of a situation that compels the British 'to put out such silly lies'.{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=50}} }}\n\nInevitably the story made its way back to the UK. Publication of the contents of propaganda leaflets dropped by the RAF was not permitted{{sfn|Thomson|1947|p=26}} and other stories such as an official statement from the Free French Information Service through the Ministry of Information saying that \"30,000 Germans drowning in an attempted embarkation last September\" were suppressed.{{sfn|Thomson|1947|p=71}} Vivid and plausible accounts of a thwarted invasion were published in American newspapers<ref>\n{{cite news\n | url        = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19410416&id=D8waAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cEwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3091,2879310\n | title      = Flaming Sea Foiled Nazi Invasion Attempt, Report\n | author     =\n | newspaper  = [[Pittsburgh Press|The Pittsburgh Press]]\n | date       = 16 April 1941\n | at         = p.8 column C\n | accessdate = 6 February 2013\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n | url        = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19440927&id=Gh8aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6yQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4008,4473730\n | title      = Asserts Bath of Fire Foiled Nazi Invasion\n | author     = John A.

With the accumulation of invasion barges and favourable tides the authorities were convinced that invasion was imminent, the codeword ''Cromwell'' was passed to the Army and Home Forces.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=276}}{{sfn|WWII Day-by-Day}} The codeword was only meant to indicate ''invasion imminent'', but with a nation tense with expectation and some Home Guardsmen incompletely briefed, some believed that the invasion had started and this caused great confusion.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=276}} In some areas, church bells were rung on receipt of the codeword even though this was only supposed to happen when invaders were in the immediate area.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=276}} Roadblocks were set up, some bridges blown and [[land mine]]s sown on some roads (killing 3 Guards officers). [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] units searched beaches for invasion barges and scanned the skies for approaching German paratroopers, but none came. Public recollection of these events did much to reinforce the idea that some kind of landing had in fact been attempted.\n\nThe burning sea lie provided the British with their first major [[black propaganda]] victory. The compelling story is likely to be the basis of a number of invasion myths that remained in circulation throughout the remainder of the 20th century: that the Germans attempted an invasion which was thwarted by the use of sea-burning bombs.{{sfn|Hayward|2001|loc=''passim''}} The most persistent of these stories becoming known as the [[Shingle Street|Shingle Street Mystery]] named after an isolated village on the Suffolk coast.{{sfn|Hayward|2001|loc=''passim''}}\n\n=== Flame barrage ===\n[[File:Invasion Defences in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H7019.jpg|thumb|right|A flame barrage demonstration on the sea at Studland Bay, Dorset]]\n\nPropaganda aside, the efforts of the PWD were real enough: they continued with experiments to actually set the sea on fire. Although initial tests were discouraging, [[Geoffrey Lloyd, Baron Geoffrey-Lloyd|Geoffrey Lloyd]] was reluctant to let the matter go.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=38}} On 24 August 1940, on the northern shores of the [[Solent]], near [[Titchfield]], ten tanker wagons began to pump oil down pipes running from the top of a thirty-foot (10 m) high cliff down into the water at the rate of about 12 tons per hour. In front of many spectators, the oil was ignited by flares and a system of sodium and petrol pellets.{{sfn|Banks|1946|pp=40\u201341}} In a matter of seconds, a raging wall of flame was produced; the intense heat caused the water to boil and people at the cliff edge were obliged to retreat. The demonstration was very dramatic,{{sfn|IWM Film WPN 220|loc=time: 0:19}} but it was not an unqualified success because the circumstances were improbably favourable: in the sheltered waters of the Solent, the sun-warmed sea was calm and the winds light.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=41}} A lengthy series of experiments continued with many reverses, in one case the pipes attached to ''[[admiralty scaffolding]]'' (an anti-tank barrier of scaffolding placed in the shallows) were torn up in a storm and in another incident [[sappers]] were blown up by beach mines. It was found that effectiveness was very much affected by sea conditions; a low temperature made ignition more difficult and waves would quickly break up the oil into small ineffectual slicks.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=42}}\n\nOn 20 December 1940, Field Marshals [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Alexander]] and [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]] and many other senior officers gathered for a demonstration. The performance was completely unconvincing with just a few small pools of burning oil battered by the surf. The cold, cloudy weather matched the mood of pessimism; Banks describes this day as the Black Friday in the annals of the Petroleum Warfare Department.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=42}}\n\nGeneral Alexander was sympathetic to the PWD's problems and suggested that the pipes be moved to a point immediately above the high tide point and, after several months of further work this proved to be the solution \u2013 oil sprayed and burnt over rather than on the water.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=42}}{{sfn|IWM Film WPN 220|loc=time: 1:35}} On 24 February 1941 the Chiefs of Staff committee, that included General Brooke, watched films of the recent experiments and approved the installation of fifty miles of flame barrage: twenty five miles on the south-eastern coast, fifteen miles on the Eastern and ten miles on the southern commands.{{sfn|Alanbrooke|2001|loc=Entry: 24 February 1941}}\n\nAlthough Geoffrey Lloyd, Secretary for Petroleum, was enthusiastic, General Brooke was, on reflection, not convinced of its efficacy. Brooke's main objections were that the weapon was dependent upon favourable winds, it created a smokescreen that might favour the enemy and that it was very vulnerable to bombing and shell fire; in any case, it was of short duration.{{sfn|NA WO 193/734}} The required resources were considerable and there was a serious shortage of materials; lack of support from authorities and the competing demands for supplies meant that the plans were cut back to thirty miles of barrage, then fifteen{{sfn|NA CAB 79|loc=COS(41) 314th Meeting}} and then less than ten miles.{{sfn|Banks|1946|pp=45\u201346}} According to Banks: \"Lengths of this flame defence ultimately were completed at [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] between [[Kingsdown, Kent|Kingsdown]] and [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], at [[St Margaret's at Cliffe|St. Margaret's Bay]], at [[White Cliffs of Dover|Shakespeare Cliff]] near [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway#Tunnels|Dover railway tunnel]], at [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] where a remarkable system of remote control across the marshes was installed, and at [[Studland Bay]]. In [[South Wales]] long stretches were put in hand at the time when the airborne threat to [[\u00c9ire]] (Ireland) was looming large, and sections at [[Wick, Highland|Wick]] and [[Thurso]], but these were not brought to completion. At [[Porthcurno]], where the important [[Porthcurno Telegraph Museum|transatlantic cables]] came ashore, a gravity fed section was put in as a security measure against raids.\"{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=46}}\n\n== Portable flamethrowers ==\nDuring [[World War I]] the British had developed [[flamethrower]]s. Banks had seen the [[Livens Large Gallery Flame Projector]] used at the Somme in July 1916 and a large scale flamethrower had been installed on [[HMS Vindictive (1897)|HMS ''Vindictive'']] and used in the [[Zeebrugge Raid|raid on Zeebrugge]].{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=62}} Portable flamethrowing apparatus was also designed but the war ended before it could be fully employed; further development ceased and records of the work were lost.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=62}}\n\nWork restarted in 1939 at the newly formed [[Ministry of Supply]] Research Department at [[Woolwich]] and many of the basic technical problems were investigated such as the design of valves and nozzles, the problem of ignition, and of fuels and propellants.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=62}} Independently Commander Marsden was working on portable flamethrowers for the Army.{{sfn|Banks|1946|pp=62\u201363}} His work eventually resulted in the semi-portable \"Harvey\" flamethrower and the backpack \"Marsden\" flamethrower. Meanwhile, the PWD developed the Home Guard Flamethrower as a quickly extemporised weapon.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=65}}\n\n=== Home Guard Flamethrower ===\nThe so-called Home Guard Flamethrower was not a flamethrower in the conventional sense, but a small, semi-mobile flame trap.\n\nFrom about September 1940, 300 [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] units received a kit of parts provided by the PWD: a {{convert|50|to|65|impgal|l}} barrel, {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=off}} of hose, a hand pump, some connective plumbing and a set of do-it-yourself instructions.{{sfn|Weeks|1975|p=49}}{{sfn|Clarke|2011|p=175}} The barrel was set upon an {{convert|8+1/2|ft|m|spell=in|adj=mid|-long}} hand cart that was made locally from [[wikt:four by two|four by two]] inch timber and mounted on a pair of wheels salvaged from a car axle. The nozzle and ground spike were of simple construction from sections of three-quarter-inch diameter gas pipe with a used food can over the end to catch drips of fuel that would maintain a flame when the pressure was allowed to drop. When completed, the weapon was filled with a 40/60 mixture obtained locally.\n\nThe Home Guard Flame Thrower was light enough to be wheeled along roads and possibly over fields to where it was needed by its crew of five to six men. It would be used as part of an ambush in combination with Molotov cocktails and whatever other weapons were available. The pump was operated by hand and would give a flame of up to {{convert|60|ft|m|spell=in}} in length \u2013 but only for about two minutes of continuous operation.{{sfn|IWM K98/152}}{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=64-67}}{{sfn|IWM Film MGH 6799|loc=time: 4:07}}\n\n=== Harvey flamethrower ===\n{{multiple image\n | image1    = Harvey Flame Thrower transport diagram.jpg\n | alt1      = Harvey Flame Thrower transport diagram.\n | caption1  = Transport\n | width1    = 100\n | image2    = Harvey Flame Thrower use diagram.jpg\n | alt2      = Harvey Flame Thrower in use diagram.\n | caption2  = In use\n | width2    = 373\n | footer    = Harvey Flame Thrower\n}}\n\nThe Harvey flamethrower was introduced in August 1940, it was mostly made from readily available parts such as wheels from agricultural equipment manufacturers and commercially available compressed air cylinders.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=273}} It comprised a welded steel cylinder containing 22 gallons (100 l) of [[creosote]] and a standard bottle of compressed [[nitrogen]] at {{convert|1,800|psi|bar}} mounted on a [[sack truck]] of the type that a railway station porter might use. {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=off}} of [[Metal hose|armoured hose]] provided the connection to a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|spell=in|-long}} lance with a nozzle and some [[Kerosene|paraffin]] soaked cotton waste that was set alight to provide a source of ignition.

The first product of this work was a prototype of Cockatrice that was demonstrated in August 1940.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=69}} Reginald Fraser of [[Imperial College]], [[London University]], who was also a director of the [[Lagonda|Lagonda car company]], developed an annular flamethrower, that threw petrol with an outer layer of thickened fuel. He thought that this would reduce the risk of fire working backwards to the fuel tank because oxygen would not be present.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=67}} With the encouragement of the PWD, Fraser produced and demonstrated a prototype at [[Snoddington|Snoddington Furze]] in August 1940. Fraser went on and had an experimental vehicle put together by Lagonda on a [[Commer]] lorry chassis.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=67}} A demonstration of the Lagonda vehicle at PWD's test site at Moody Down farm near [[Winchester]] was attended by [[Nevil Shute Norway]] and Lieutenant Jack Cooke of the Admiralty [[Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development]].{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=45}} Norway later recalled \"It was a terrifying apparatus&nbsp;...

The Army showed little interest in ''Cockatrice'' and it never went into mass production.{{sfn|Fletcher|2007|pp=3\u20136}}{{efn|The Cockatrice vehicle weighed over twelve tons and was very difficult to bring to a sudden stop. In one notable incident, when returning from trials and on turning at a bend in the road, a driver found his way blocked by temporary barrier.

German pilots were in the habit of attacking coastal vessels, flying in very low hoping to avoid detection and dropping their bombs before flying over the ship at mast height.{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=46}} Norway thought that a vertical flamethrower might discourage such attacks. An experiment with a Cockatrice-like flamethrower on board ''La Patrie'', the flame's length was increased by the up-draft of the heat generated so that the pillar of fire reached {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} vertically.{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=46}} A pilot was found to make dummy attacks, flying closer and closer with each pass he eventually had his wingtip virtually in the flame.{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=47}} Norway was disheartened to find that the pilot was not more deterred by the flames but the pilot had been briefed to know what to expect. In a later trial with a pilot who had not been told about the flame weapon, Norway was dismayed to see that he flew with half a wing cutting into the flame. It transpired that this pilot had worked for a stunt firm and he was used to driving cars \"through plates of glass and walls of fire\".{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=47}} Despite these discouraging results, the flamethrower was installed on a number of coastal vessels.

The Canadians had determined that devoting a Universal Carrier exclusively to the flamethrower role was inefficient and they redesigned the Wasp so that the carrier could also function in its normal manner.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=272}} This was achieved by removing the internal fuel tanks and replacing them with a single tank externally mounted at the back of the vehicle.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=272}} This allowed room inside for a third crew member who could carry a light machine gun.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=272}} The Mk IIC was much more tactically flexible and it gradually became the favoured type.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=272}}{{sfn|Swettenham|1968|pp=169\u2013171}} In June 1944 all Wasp production was changed to the Mk IIC and existing MK IIs were also adapted to this standard.

Shanklin was, as it is today, a popular [[seaside resort]] at [[Sandown Bay]] on the [[Isle of Wight]]. Many of its [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] houses and hotels had been bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]], providing excellent cover for PLUTO's pump houses.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=47}} At Sandown, the pumps were installed in the old fortifications of the [[Yaverland Battery]].

This pumping station received oil from west coast ports and from the [[Isle of Grain]] oil terminal.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=51}} The route of the pipeline was chosen to give the enemy the impression that the oil was being sent to the area between Hythe and Folkstone, consistent with an allied invasion at the [[Pas-de-Calais]]. Pumps were installed into some of the many seaside homes at Dungeness and the pipes were covered in the shingle of which the headland is largely composed.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=52}}\n\nThe first connection attempted was a HAIS pipe which was laid on 10 October. Vital lessons had been learned from earlier experience and the difficulties in making the shore connections were overcome.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=66}} However, worsening weather and waning official enthusiasm dampened progress. Fuel pumping was delayed until 27 October and by December only four HAIS pipe were working and these had to run at a relatively low pressure resulting in daily delivery of just 700 tons of fuel.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=66}} Despite official doubts, PLUTO continued. HAMEL pipe was more difficult to bring ashore and especially so in poor weather; the problem was solved by adding lengths of HAIS pipe onto the ends of a HAMEL pipeline as it was wound onto a ''conundrum'' greatly simplifying shore connection.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=69}}\n\nSeventeen pipelines were laid from Dungeness to Boulogne of which up to 11 were working until the end of the war.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=69}} This route had a capacity of {{convert|1350000|impgal|USgal l}} per day and regularly delivered more than {{convert|1000000|impgal|USgal l}} daily {{sfn|Searle|1995|p=69}}  Although this delivery rate was impressive, it actually represented little more than 10% of fuel transported across the Channel and this was achieved too late to have any impact on the campaign.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=76}} The pipelines were not designed to last long, the steel HAMEL pipes generally succumbed to friction with the sea bed within a few weeks and the HAIS pipes lasted only a little longer.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=76}}\n\nPluto was blighted by the bad luck such as the delays capturing Cherbourg and an inability to translate the results of trials into reality quickly enough to keep up with the fighting.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=76}} Things could have turned out differently and nothing should be allowed to subtract from the impressive technical achievement under very difficult circumstances.{{sfn|Searle|1995|pp=77\u201378}}\n\n\"In retrospect, it seems clear that PLUTO's advocates had been far too sanguine. They had assumed that it would be possible for the naval laying units to achieve immediately the degree of technical proficiency attained by the technically expert laying parties in the trials conducted in 1943 under the supervision of those who had designed the equipment; and that what could be done in the Bristol Channel and the Solent could be done in wartime operational conditions on the much longer lay across the Channel\"{{efn|DJ Payton-Smith quoted by Searle.{{sfn|Searle|1995|pp=77\u201378}} }}\n\n=== Recovery ===\n\nPLUTO ceased operation in July 1945, just a few months after the end of fighting in Europe.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=69}}{{sfn|Knight|Smith|Barnett|1998|p=27}} Because the pipes were a hazard to shipping, the Royal Navy cut the pipe and removed sections that were just a few miles offshore.{{sfn|Knight|Smith|Barnett|1998|p=27}} Starting in August 1946, the former HMS ''Latimer'' was used in a private salvage operation.{{sfn|Knight|Smith|Barnett|1998|p=27}} The first part of the operation used a [[Grapple (tool)|grapple]] to find a pipeline and haul it up and onto the ship's bow.{{sfn|Knight|Smith|Barnett|1998|p=27}}\n\nHAIS was found to be in good condition and its high lead content made salvage particularly valuable; each pipe could be cut just once and then coiled in the ship's hold. Lengths of HAIS pipes were cleared of petrol and cut into lengths suitable for transportation by rail.{{sfn|PLUTO \u2013 The Salvage Operation}} These short lengths were sent to [[Swansea]] where the recovered lead was melted and cast into [[ingots]]; the wires were straightened and used as [[rebars]]; the steel tapes were flatted and used to make corner reinforcements for heavy duty cardboard boxes; and the jute was made into blocks that could be burned as fuel in a furnace.{{sfn|PLUTO \u2013 The Salvage Operation}}\n\nThe HAMEL pipes were also valuable, but being less flexible, needed to be cut into lengths on the deck of the recovery ship.{{sfn|Knight|Smith|Barnett|1998|p=27}} Cutting either type of pipeline was very dangerous because the pipes still contained petrol.{{sfn|PLUTO \u2013 The Salvage Operation}} The contaminated petrol from both types of pipe was recovered and cleaned up, yielding some {{convert|66000|impgal|USgal l}} of useful fuel.{{sfn|PLUTO \u2013 The Salvage Operation}}\n\nThe salvage operation lasted three years.

Fog was a particularly serious hazard, settling unpredictably over airfields where tired, possibly injured, pilots in aeroplanes short of fuel and in some cases damaged, had to land.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=2}} The night of 16/17 October 1940 was particularly unfortunate. In raids by 73 bombers three aircraft were shot down but ten crashed on landing. When this was brought to the attention of Prime Minister Churchill he demanded that something be done: \"...&nbsp;It ought to be possible to guide them down quite safely as commercial craft were before the war in spite of fog. Let me have full particulars. The accidents last night are very serious\"{{efn|Churchill quoted by Williams.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=2}} }}\n\nPreviously Professor [[David Brunt]] of [[Imperial College London]] had calculated that if the temperature of a volume of fog were raised by about {{convert|5|F-change|0}} it would evaporate. Some preliminary experiments had been conducted between 1936 and 1939 using burners based on agricultural sprayers and a fuel that was a mixture of petrol and alcohol. Although the heat generated was not sufficient to clear a substantial volume of fog, the feasibility of the method was established. However, no further development took place.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=3}}\n\nAs the bomber offensive grew in scale, more aircraft flew ever greater distances and more accidents followed. Despite Churchill's injunction, no measures being taken to reduce the losses caused by bad weather.

Lloyd visited fruit farmers who used [[Smudge pot]] heaters to protect their crops;{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=8}} Hartley arranged for a part of the [[King George VI Reservoir]] that had been left empty for the duration of the war to be used for experiments;{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=8}} and Walker took to long walks on foggy nights wearing a government issue [[donkey jacket]] \u2013 much to the puzzlement of his family.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=7}} Experiments were quickly put in hand with large scale tests taking place in the reservoir and smaller scale tests in a disused indoor [[ice rink]] at [[Earls Court]]{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=8}} where a wind tunnel was set up so that a wide range of weather conditions could be simulated.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=11}}\n\nIn some of the earliest experiments, Wasp flame throwers were used.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=14}} A Cockatrice in thick fog fired six {{frac|1|1|2}} second busts which cleared the air in its immediate vicinity.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=14}}\n\nThe first purpose designed burner was known as ''Four-Oaks'' used a mixture of petrol and alcohol, but it was not possible to obtain a smokeless flame.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=14}} On 4 November 1942 a test was performed with two rows of Four-Oaks burners {{convert|200|yd|m}} long and {{convert|100|yd|m}} apart. A fireman went up an escape ladder borrowed for the experiments and he disappeared into the gloom after climbing just a few rungs. As the burners got going he reappeared at the top of the {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} ladder only to disappear again when the burners were turned off.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=16}} Unfortunately, the Four-Oaks burner produced as much smoke as it cleared fog and did not produce a really satisfactory degree of heating. Experiments with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] burners worked better, at least initially,{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=16}} but they could not be controlled and caused smoke and other problems.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nA new burner called ''Haigas'' (later known as the Mark I) was developed. Haigas used petrol which was preheated to form a vapour before it was burnt, thereby significantly increasing efficiency and reducing smoke.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=19\u201320}} An experimental system was installed at [[Graveley, Cambridgeshire|Graveley]], Cambridgeshire and was tested for the first time on 18 February 1943 in poor visibility, although not thick fog.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=19\u201320}} The pilot, [[Air commodore]] [[Don Bennett]], commander of the [[Pathfinder (RAF)|RAF Pathfinder Force]], said \"I had vague thoughts of seeing lions jumping through a hoop of flames at the circus. The glare was certainly considerable and there was some runway turbulence, but it was nothing to worry about.\"{{efn|Air commodore Bennett quoted by Williams.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=20}} }} Graveley became the first operational FIDO site and the system was rapidly expanded.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=20\u201323}}\n\nThe Haigas (or Mark I) burner was {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and comprised four connected lengths of pipe held just above ground level. The pipes ran back and forth in close proximity along the burner's length. After traversing the length of the burner three times, the petrol flowed into the fourth length of pipe: a burner pipe that was pierced with holes. The circuitous route of the fuel allowed it to be heated and vaporised by the heat of burners, this was done so that it would burn efficiently and without producing significant amounts of smoke.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=17}}\n\nLater burner designs called the ''Haigill'' system and designated Mark II to Mark VI were simpler and more efficient, requiring only three lengths of pipe. Earlier versions of Haigill used two runs of evaporator pipe and one burner pipe, later versions used one run of evaporator pipe and two burner pipes.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=24}}\n\nLater still, the ''Hairpin'' burner was developed, it had one length of evaporator pipe immediately above one length of burner pipe. Hairpin was set in a specially shaped [[cast-iron]] trough in a heat-resistant concrete trench that was then covered in a grid of steel bars at ground level.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=29\u201330}} This design did not generate any more heat than the earlier versions, but was much less intrusive upon air operations.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=29\u201330}} Yet more sophisticated designs followed along similar lines.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=30\u201335}}\n\nThe value of FIDO is difficult to estimate. Approximately 700 aircraft landed with FIDO operating in foggy conditions and about 2,000 landed with FIDO being used allowing the runway to be identified in conditions of limited visibility.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=41}} Some 3,500 aircrew owe their lives to FIDO and for perhaps 10,000 others a serious situation made easier.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=41}} The FIDO system was briefly used commercially. It was intended to be used at [[London Heathrow Airport]] and small sections were put in place.{{sfn|Hansard \u2013 FIDO Abandonment}} However, advances in various landing systems made FIDO redundant.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=29-30}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:PLUTO Pump Sandown Isle of Wight.jpg|thumb|right|PLUTO Pump at Sandown Zoo on the Isle of Wight]]\n\nWhen the war in Europe was nearly won, the activities of the Petroleum Warfare Department were widely publicised as being demonstrative of British ingenuity.{{sfn|Times 4 June 1945}}{{sfn|Popular Science August 1945}} [[Newsreel]]s told the British public how flamethrower weapons had been developed to defend the country against invasion{{sfn|Path\u00e9 News: Flame Throwers}}{{sfn|Path\u00e9 News: Defence By Fire}} and how the PLUTO and FIDO projects had help win the war.{{sfn|Path\u00e9 News: Operation Pluto}}{{sfn|Path\u00e9 News: F.I.D.O.}}\n\nThe Petroleum Warfare Department planned a travelling exhibition of its achievements; the end of hostilities caused a change of plan: a temporary exhibition at the otherwise closed [[Imperial War Museum]].

Later in the war, the department was instrumental in the creation of the [[Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation]] (commonly known as FIDO) that cleared runways of [[fog]] allowing the landing of aircraft returning from [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing raids over Germany]] in poor visibility; and [[Operation Pluto]] which installed prefabricated fuel pipelines between England and France soon after the Allied [[Invasion of Normandy]] in June 1944.{{sfn|PLUTO \u2013 Combined Operations}}\n\n== Inception ==\n[[File:Maurice Hankey.jpg|thumb|right|Maurice Hankey, 1921]]\n\nAt the beginning of [[World War II]], in September 1939, there was little fighting in the West until the German invasion of France and the [[low countries]] in May 1940. Following the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] and the withdrawal of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) from [[Operation Dynamo|the beaches at Dunkirk]] in June 1940, Britain was [[Operation Sealion|threatened with invasion]] by [[History of Germany during World War II|German armed forces in 1940 and 1941]].{{sfn|NA WO 199/1433}}\n\nIn response to this threat of invasion, the British sought to expand the [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Air Force]], and Army and to replace the equipment that had been left behind at Dunkirk. Also, to supplement the regular armed services with volunteer organisations such as the part-time soldiers in the [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]]. With many types of equipment in short supply, there were frantic efforts to develop new weapons \u2013 particularly those that did not require scarce materials.{{sfn|NA WO 199/1433}}\n\nAlthough oil imports from the Middle East had stopped and most oil for Britain came from the United States, there was at this time no shortage of oil: supplies originally intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities and there were full tankers kept waiting in American ports.{{sfn|NA PREM 3/264}}{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=27}} The amount of petrol allocated for civilian use was strictly rationed and pleasure motoring was strongly discouraged. This was not, at least initially, because of a shortage of petrol but because it might lead to large congregations of well-fuelled vehicles at popular places.{{sfn|Graves|1943|p=74}}\n\nIn the event of an invasion, the British would be faced with the problem of destroying this embarrassment of riches lest it should prove of use to the enemy (as it had in France{{sfn|Ironside|1962|loc = Entry: 24 May 1940}}). By mid-June, as a basic anti-invasion precaution, wayside [[petrol stations]] near the coast had been emptied, or at least had their pumps disabled, and garages everywhere were required to have a plan to prevent their stocks being of use to the invader.<ref>If The Invader Comes. Ministry of Information. 1940, rule IV.</ref>\n\nOn 29 May 1940, as the evacuation of the BEF was in progress, [[Maurice Hankey]] then a cabinet [[minister without portfolio]], joined the Ministerial Committee on Civil Defence (CDC) chaired by [[Sir John Anderson]], the [[Home Secretary|Secretary of State for the Home Office]] and [[Ministry of Home Security|Home Security]].{{sfn|Roskill|1974|p=471}} Among many ideas, Hankey \"brought out of his stable a hobby horse which he had ridden very hard in the 1914\u201318 war \u2013 namely the use of burning oil for defensive purposes.\"{{sfn|Roskill|1974|p=472}} Hankey believed that oil should not just be denied to an invader, but used to impede him.{{sfn|Roskill|1974|p=472}} Towards the end of June Hankey brought his scheme up at a meeting of the Oil Control Board and produced for Commander-in-Chief Home Forces [[Edmund Ironside, 1st Baron Ironside|Edmund Ironside]] extracts of his paper on experiments with oil in the First World War.{{sfn|Roskill|1974|p=472}} On 5 June, Churchill authorised [[Geoffrey Lloyd, Baron Geoffrey-Lloyd|Geoffrey Lloyd]], the [[Secretary for Petroleum]] to press ahead with experiments, with Hankey taking the matter under his general supervision.{{sfn|Roskill|1974|p=472}}\n\n== Donald Banks ==\n[[Donald Banks]] (1891\u20131975) had served with distinction in World War I winning the DSO and MC. He joined the civil service and in 1934 he was made Director-General of the Post Office,{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=4}}{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=4}} he then moved to the Air Ministry and served there as Permanent Under Secretary from 1936\u201338.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=4}}{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=5}} Due to overwork, Banks was given lighter duties, including a mission to Australia to advise on aircraft production and a job at the [[Import Duties Advisory Committee]].{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=5}} During this period, Banks had remained on the rolls of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army Reserve of Officers]]. When hostilities broke out in September 1939, the advisory committee was abolished and he was free to serve in the armed forces.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=9}}\n\nBanks was soon posted as [[air attach\u00e9]] to the [[quartermaster general]] of [[50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division]] \u2013 a first line division of the Territorial Army.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=6}} Banks got on well with his commander, [[Giffard LeQuesne Martel]]. Banks admired his leadership and his enthusiasm for experimentation and improvisation.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=10}} In October 1939, the division was sent to the [[Cotswold]]s and in January 1940 it was moved to France.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=6}}\n\nWhen Germany attacked in May, the division was heavily involved in [[Battle of Arras (1940)|the fighting around Arras]] and was later withdrawn to the coast. Banks later recalled looking out to sea from a cliff top and seeing \"an awe-inspiring sight [...] A few miles away an oil tanker had been bombed or had struck a mine. Masses of the blackest smoke pillared up into a gigantic pall in the sky while in the vast lake of fire, spreading it seemed for miles on the water a flame blazed and leapt like an angry volcano [...] I was often to recall that scene in subsequent days of Flame Warfare\".{{sfn|Banks|1946|pp=18\u201319}} The division was [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated to England]].\n\nEarly in July 1940, [[Donald Banks|Banks]] was summoned to the presence of [[Geoffrey Lloyd, Baron Geoffrey-Lloyd|Geoffrey Lloyd]], who explained the vision that he and Hankey shared: \"Flame all across Britain\" he said, \"ringing the coasts, spurting from the hedges and rolling down the hills. We will burn the invader back into the sea.\"{{efn|Lloyd quoted by Banks.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=27}}}}\n\nConsidering Lloyd's ideas over the next few days Banks consulted with other soldiers, he found both professional scepticism and enthusiasm. Banks, a man who said he preferred the prospect of real fighting over [[Narcissistic leadership|Whitehall warfare]], was not himself keen and his first instinct was to suggest that petroleum weapons should be developed locally.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=28}} Lloyd would have none of it and Banks was ordered to report to him for special duties. On 9 July, cutting through red tape, the Petroleum Warfare Department was created.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=29}}\n\nThe Petroleum Warfare Department started on 9 July 1940 in three small rooms. They were independently administered and financed with a few staff entirely lacking in technical knowledge.{{sfn|Banks|1946|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n== Flame traps ==\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Hankey and Lloyd were not alone in their interest in the development of petroleum warfare weapons; encouragement came from the highest quarters. In August a note from the Chief Engineer's office at GHQ Home Forces read: \"The PM is personally interested in it. It is something which can be provided without any adverse effect on the production of other equipment or on our War effort generally. It is unlikely that we shall have enough A/T weapons to cover all our road blocks for many months, if ever. These flame traps do at least give the Home Guard a sporting chance of frying a few Germans.\"{{sfn|NA WO 199/1433}}\n| width = 25%\n| align = right\n}}\n\nPWD took inspiration from events that happened during the retreat to Dunkirk in June 1940.{{sfn|Times 4 June 1945}} One example occurred when [[Boulogne]] was attacked in the early hours of 23 May and the road to [[Calais]] was cut.{{sfn|Jackson|2002|p=43}} In the defence of Boulogne, a group of [[Pioneer (military)|pioneers]] under [[Donald John Dean|Lieutenant-Colonel Donald Dean VC]], had improvised a road block made of vehicles and piles of furniture from bombed-out houses. An approaching tank began to push its way over the obstruction, as Dean wrote:\n\n{{cquote|We were prepared for this&nbsp;... I had some lorry petrol tanks punctured with a pick, the tank being unable to shell us during its crushing climb, and we set fire to the lot. A sheet of flame went up, and the tank backed hastily off&nbsp;... Our roadblock burned for quite a while, and allowed for a further block to be made under cover of smoke.{{efn|Lieutenant-Colonel Donald Dean quoted by Sebag-Montefiore.{{sfn|Sebag-Montefiore|2007|p=199}} }} }}\n\nThe newly formed department quickly made arrangements for some practical experiments at [[Dumpton Gap]] in Kent. These were the source of some excitement for witnesses, who included the pilots of enemy planes. Many of the first ideas to be tried proved fruitless, but experience quickly led to the development of the first practical weapon: the static flame trap.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=32}}\n\n=== Static flame trap ===\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = I lived in Longniddry from 1927 until my wife and I moved [away] ... twenty years ago. [...] It was on a platform high up in the trees opposite a dip in the road between the two old telegraph poles. My recollection is that the tank was as high as the telegraph poles. A vertical pipe from the tank was connected to a horizontal pipe fixed to the top of the wall.  This pipe had a line of small holes along its length. Opening a valve inside the wood allowed the petrol to escape under a considerable pressure head.\n\nI only saw this Flamme operated once. Army personnel for the Home Guard laid on a demonstration. The petrol valve was opened and created a huge spray, which reached the opposite side of the road.  I think the original idea was that a limited amount of petrol would be released, but the valve remained open.  An army Sergeant with a [[Very pistol]] fired a round (from the top of the Goods Yard) into the pool of petrol in the road dip, while fuel was still coming out at force.\n\nIt created one of the fiercest of fires I have seen, destroying the grass banks, the railway sleeper fence, scorched the telegraph poles and burned the surface off the road.  Very effective! This little episode (about 1940-41) was never repeated!{{efn|William J.

The fuel mixture was 25% petrol and 75% [[Fuel oil|gas-oil]] that was contrived to be of no use as motor vehicle fuel should it be captured. All that was required to trigger the weapon was to open a valve and for a [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guardsman]] to throw in a [[Molotov cocktail]] creating an inferno. The ideal location for the trap was a place where vehicles could not easily escape, such as a steep-sided [[sunken road]]. Some trouble was taken with camouflage: pipes could be hidden in gutters or disguised as handrails; others were simply left as innocent looking plumbing.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=32}}\n\nAll the required pipes and valves could be obtained from the gas and water industries with little modification required beyond drilling a few holes. In general, gravity was all that was required to provide sufficient pressure for the fountains of oil, but where necessary pumps were provided.{{sfn|NA SUPP 15/29}}\n\nLater versions were a little more sophisticated; remote ignition could be achieved in a variety of ways. In one system, called the Birch Igniter, the pressure of the oil at the end of the pipe would squeeze [[glycerine]] from a rubber bulb; the glycerine would fall onto a container of [[potassium permanganate]], which would then ignite spontaneously. Another method was to run a pair of small rubber tubes, down one of which would be passed [[acetylene]] and the other [[chlorine]]; when, at the far end, these two gasses were allowed to mix, there would be a spontaneous ignition. This system had the advantage that it could be turned on and off repeatedly.{{sfn|NA SUPP 15/29}} The development of the [[flame fougasse]] (see below) provided a method of remote electrical ignition that could only be used once, but was virtually instantaneous.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=32}}\n\nSome 200 static flame traps were installed, mainly by the employees of oil companies whose services were placed at the disposal of the government.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=33}}\n\n=== Mobile flame traps ===\n\nIn addition to the static flame traps, mobile units were created. The main design used an otherwise redundant {{convert|200|-|300|impgal|l|adj=on}} tank mounted on the back of a 30 cwt lorry, just behind the cabin. In the middle of the remaining space was a petrol-driven pump and either side of this was stored {{convert|75|ft|m|abbr=off}} of armoured rubber hose. Two nozzles were provided with a primitive sight and with spikes for pushing into the ground. Gas tubes for chlorine and acetylene gas were provided for ignition. The resulting jets of flame had a range of {{convert|60|-|70|ft|m}}.{{sfn|NA SUPP 15/29}}\n\nBecause there was a shortage of pumps \u2013 they were badly needed for fighting fires started by bombing \u2013 a simpler type of mobile flame trap was also designed. This consisted of a number of {{convert|12|in|cm|adj=on|sigfig=1}} diameter pipes welded shut to make a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} long cylindrical drum which was filled with {{convert|43|impgal|l}} of gasoline-oil mixture and pressurised with an inert gas. A number of these cylinders could be transported on the back of a vehicle and, at a weight of just under {{convert|1000|lb|kg}}, could be deployed reasonably quickly wherever an ambush was required. The cylinders would be placed at intervals along a road each with a short length of hose leading to a nozzle secured by ground spikes. Flow was initiated by a pull-string that opened a valve and ignition was provided by [[Molotov cocktail]]s.{{sfn|NA SUPP 15/29}}\n\n=== Flame fougasse ===\n[[File:D 024854 new.jpg|thumb|right|A demonstration of 'Fougasse', somewhere in Britain.

His best-known invention was the [[Livens Projector]]: a simple mortar that could throw a projectile containing about {{convert|30|lb|kg|abbr=off}} of explosives, incendiary oil or, most commonly, poisonous [[phosgene]] gas. The great advantage of the Livens Projector was that it was cheap, this allowed hundreds, and on occasions thousands, to be set up and then fired simultaneously, catching the enemy by surprise.{{sfn|NA MUN 5}}{{sfn|Palazzo|2002|p=103}} Both Livens and Newton experimented with field expedient versions of the Livens Projector using commercially available five gallon drums and tubes.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=53}} Newton experimented with firing milk bottles filled with phosphorus using a rifle. None of these experiments were taken forward.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=53}}\n\nOne of Livens' PWD demonstrations, probably first seen about mid-July at [[Dumpton Gap]],{{efn|Livens had briefly experimented with a similar weapons during the First World War.{{sfn|Foulkes|2001|p=167}} }} was particularly promising. A barrel of oil was blown up on the beach; Lloyd was said to have been particularly impressed when he observed a party of high-ranking officers witnessing a test from the top of a cliff making \"an instantaneous and precipitate movement to the rear\".{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=33}} The work was dangerous, Livens and Banks were experimenting with five-gallon drums in the shingle at [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] when a [[short circuit]] triggered several weapons. By good fortune, the battery of drums where the party was standing failed to go off.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=34}}\n\nThe experiments led to a particularly promising arrangement: a forty-gallon [[Drum (container)|steel drum]]{{efn|Although the standard capacity is 44 imperial gallons (55 US gallons), historical records generally refer to 40-gallon drums and sometimes 50-gallon drums apparently interchangeably.}} buried in an earthen bank with just the round front end exposed. At the back of the drum was an explosive which when triggered ruptured the drum and shot a jet of flame about {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|30|yd|m}} long.{{sfn|Barrel Flame Traps|1942|p=6}} The design was reminiscent of a weapon dating from late medieval times called a [[fougasse (weapon)|fougasse]]: a hollow in which was placed a barrel of gunpowder covered by rocks, the explosives to be detonated by a fuse at an opportune moment. Livens' new weapon was duly dubbed the flame fougasse.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=34}} The flame fougasse was demonstrated to [[Clement Attlee]], [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]] and [[Claude Liardet|General Liardet]] on 20 July 1940.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=34}}{{sfn|IWM Film MGH 6799|loc=time: 1:02}}\n\nA variant of the flame fougasse called the ''demi-gass'' was a fougasse barrel placed horizontally in the open with an explosive charge underneath that would rupture the barrel and flip it over towards the target.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=36}}{{sfn|IWM Film MGH 6799|loc=time: 3:18}} Another variant was the ''hedge hopper'', a fougasse barrel on its end with an explosive charge underneath that would send it bounding over a hedge or wall; this made the hedge hopper particularly easy to conceal.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=36}}{{sfn|IWM Film WPN 220|loc=time: 2:08}}{{sfn|IWM Film MGH 6799|loc=time: 2:57}} A further variant of the hedge hopper idea was devised for [[St. Margarets Bay, Kent|St Margaret's Bay]] where the barrels would be sent rolling over the cliff edge.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=38}}\n\nIn all some 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were distributed of which the great majority were installed in one of 7,000 batteries mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=38}} Some barrels were held in reserve while others were deployed at storage sites to destroy [[Oil depot|fuel depots]] at short notice. The size of a battery varied from just one drum to as many as fourteen; a four barrel battery was the most common installation and the recommended minimum. Where possible, half the barrels in a battery were to contain the 40/60 mixture and half the sticky 5B mixture.{{sfn|NA WO 199/1433}}\n\n== Troubled Waters ==\n=== Operation Lucid ===\n[[File:War Nawab 1919.jpg|right|thumb|[[Royal Fleet Auxiliary|RFA]] ''War Nawab'', one of the ships involved in Operation Lucid.]]\n\n{{main|Operation Lucid}}\n\nA series of experiments investigated the possibility of burning the invader's barges before they could reach the English shore. The first idea was simply to explode a vessel filled with oil, and this was tried at [[Maplin Sands]] where a Thames oil tanker, ''Suffolk'', with 50 tonnes of petroleum was blown up in shallow water.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=48}} Another idea developed was that the oil should be held in place on the water by a trough formed from [[coir]] matting. A machine formed the trough from a flat mat as it was paid out over the stern of a ship. Trials with the ''Ben Hann'' produced a flaming ribbon 880 yards long and 6 feet wide (800 m \u00d7 2 m) that could be towed at four knots.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=48}} Neither of these experiments were carried forward to produce workable defences.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=48}}\n\nThe ''Suffolk'' did, however, provide a trial run for an even more ambitious idea: the [[invasion barge]]s would be burned even before they left port.

The Germans had been practising embarkations in the barges along the French coast. Some of these barges put out to sea in order to escape British bombing and were sunk, either by bombing or bad weather. This was the source of a widespread rumour that the Germans had attempted an invasion and had suffered very heavy losses either by drowning or by being burnt in patches of sea covered with flaming oil. We took no steps to contradict such tales, which spread freely through the occupied countries in a wildly exaggerated form and gave much encouragement to the oppressed populations.\n | salign   = right\n | source   = \u2013 Winston Churchill {{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=275}}\n | width    = 25%\n}}\n\nFrom its earliest days, the Petroleum Warfare Department experimented with \"setting the sea on fire\" by burning oil that was floating on the surface. It was immediately appreciated that the possibilities of such a weapon lay not only in its ability to destroy the enemy but in the propaganda value of the terror of fire.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=57}}\n\nIn 1938 an [[Enemy Publicity Section]] created for propaganda to be sent to the enemy was formed by [[Lord Hankey]] and a new section was formed under Sir [[Campbell Stuart]] who was a former editor of ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper.{{sfn|NA CAB 101/131}}{{sfn|Ward|1997|p=31}} Being allocated premises at [[Electra House]], the new section was dubbed Department EH. During the [[Munich crisis]] of 1938, a number of leaflets were printed with the intention of dropping them over Germany. The leaflet drop never took place, but the exercise prompted Department EH to issue a note to the [[Air Ministry]] insisting on the importance of a properly coordinated system for sending information to enemy countries. The [[Permanent Secretary]] (most senior civil servant of a department) at the [[Air Ministry]] to whom the note was addressed was none other than Sir Donald Banks who would later head the PWD.{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=43}}\n\nOn 25 September 1939 Department EH was mobilised to [[Woburn Abbey]]{{sfn|NA CAB 101/131}} where it joined another subversion team known as Section D that had been formed by Major [[Laurence Grand]].\n\nIn July 1940, Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] invited [[Hugh Dalton]] to take charge of the newly formed Special Operations Executive (SOE). The mission of the SOE was to encourage and facilitate espionage and sabotage behind enemy lines or, as Churchill put, it: to \"set Europe ablaze\". Among those present at the first summit meeting of SOE on 1 July 1940 were Lord [[Hankey]], [[Geoffrey Lloyd, Baron Geoffrey-Lloyd|Geoffrey Lloyd]] and [[Desmond Morton (civil servant)|Desmond Morton]] \u2013 people who would be instrumental in the formation of the Petroleum Warfare Department just a few days later.{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=44}}\n\nDepartment EH and section D later became SO1 and SO2 of the SOE.<ref>{{cite web\n | url        = http://www.psywar.org/psywar/reproductions/day.pdf\n | format     = PDF\n | title      = The Day is Coming!

Writer [[James Hayward]] has made an extensive study of this curious story; in ''The Bodies on the Beach'', Hayward makes a compelling case for the view that the burning seas work was driven substantially by the needs of propaganda and was a sophisticated bluff that became Britain's first major propaganda success of the war. Writing just after the war, Banks admitted \"Perhaps the greatest contribution from all these variegated efforts was in building up the great propaganda story of the Flame Defence of Britain which swept the Continent of Europe in 1940.\"{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=57}}\n\nThe details of the story indicated the invention of a bomb that would spread a thin film of volatile liquid on the surface of the water and then ignite it. This rumour was whispered into attentive ears in neutral cities such as [[Stockholm]], Lisbon, [[Madrid]], [[Cairo]], [[Istanbul]], [[Ankara]], New York and other places,{{sfn|Baker White|1955|p=18}} probably around late July or early August 1940. The burning seas rumour appealed to the dark imaginations of both friend and foe. Soon, interrogation of captured [[Luftwaffe]] pilots revealed that the rumour had become common knowledge.{{sfn|Baker White|1955|p=19}}\n\nGerman armed forces began experimenting with burning floating oil. On 18 August they ignited 100 tons of floating oil \u2013 it burned for 20 minutes producing heat and copious smoke \u2013 this was almost a week before the first successful British ignition.{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=20}}\n\nIn Europe, the burning seas story became embellished to the point where the story included a German invasion attempt thwarted by the ignition of oil on water. American war correspondent [[William Lawrence Shirer]] (1904\u20131993) was based in [[Berlin]] at the time, but in mid-September he visited the city of [[Geneva]] in Switzerland.\n\n{{cquote|News coming over the near-by border of France is that the Germans have attempted a landing in Britain, but that it has been repulsed with heavy German losses. Must take this report with a grain of salt.{{sfn|Shirer|1961|loc=Entry for 16 September 1940}} }}\n\nOn the evening of the following day Shirer arrived back in Berlin:\n\n{{cquote|I noticed several lightly wounded soldiers, mostly airmen, getting off a special car which had been attached to our train. From their bandages, the wounds looked like burns. I noticed also the longest Red Cross train I've ever seen. It stretched from the station for half a mile to beyond the bridge over the [[Landwehr Canal]]. [...] I wondered where so many wounded could have come from, as the armies in the west stopped fighting three months ago. As there were only a few porters I had to wait some time on the platform and picked up a conversation with a railway workman. He said most of the men taken from the hospital train were suffering from burns.\n\nCan it be that the tales I heard in Geneva had some truth in them after all? The stories there were that either in attempted German raids with sizable landing-parties on the English coast or in rehearsals with boats and barges off the French coast the British had given the Germans a bad pummelling. The reports reaching Switzerland from France were that many German barges and ships had been destroyed and a considerable number of German troops drowned; also that the British used a new type of wireless-directed torpedo (a Swiss invention, the Swiss said) which spread ignited oil on the water and burned the barges. Those cases of burns at the station this morning bear looking into.{{sfn|Shirer|1961|loc=Entry for 18 September 1940}} }}\n\nThe following day, Shirer heard about further train loads of wounded soldiers. A plausible explanation for these wounded is that they were hurt in RAF bombing raids on ports of embarkation. Such raids were certainly going on though it seems they were generally fairly ineffective and no records of significant German casualties have been turned up.{{sfn|Hayward|1994|p=95}} It seems likely that the rumour machine inflated light casualties to proportions of strategic consequence.\n\nThe British were getting better organised. A system was set up to collect suggestions for Inspired Rumours, these suggestions, which became known as ''SIBS'' (from the [[Latin]] ''sibilare'', to hiss{{sfn|Cull|Culbert|Welch|2003|p=358}}). SIBS, were sifted through at weekly meetings in order that they should present a consistent message and to ensure that ludicrously improbable and inadvertently true rumours were filtered out.{{sfn|NA FO 898/70}} New SIBS included \"small scale attempts at invasion have been made and have been beaten off with devastating losses. In fact none are alive to tell. Thousands of floating German corpses have been washed ashore.\"{{sfn|NA FO 898/70|loc = Inspired rumours weekly report No 12}} and \"The fishing populations of the west coast of Denmark and the south coast of Norway are selling fish but they won\u2019t eat them. The reason is that there are numbers of German corpses on which the fish feed. There have even been cases of shreds of clothing and buttons, etc. being found inside the fish.\"{{sfn|NA FO 898/70|loc = Inspired rumours weekly report No 12}}\n\nThe story of the burning seas was further reinforced. In October, the RAF dropped leaflets containing handy phrases for visitors to the United Kingdom in German, French and Dutch. The phrases included \"the sea smells of petrol here\", \"the sea even burns here\", \"see how well the captain burns\", \"Karl/Willi/Fritz/Johann/Abraham: cremated/drowned/minced by the propellers!\"{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=52}} As Hayward explains, these leaflets were simply building on and reinforcing the rumours of a failed invasion attempt that were being disseminated around the world from late September.{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=47}} The original propaganda was conflated with other events both real and imaginary and the rumours spread. Of course, the German command knew that the stories were untrue; the real targets of the propaganda were the men who might actually be asked to attempt a landing in England. Berlin felt forced officially to deny the rumours:\n\n{{cquote|CHANNEL LOSSES DENIED: Berlin, September 25th (AP) \u2013 Authorised German sources said today that there was no truth in reports that many thousands of bodies of German soldiers were being washed ashore along the English Channel. Such accounts were declared to be an indication of a situation that compels the British 'to put out such silly lies'.{{sfn|Hayward|2001|p=50}} }}\n\nInevitably the story made its way back to the UK. Publication of the contents of propaganda leaflets dropped by the RAF was not permitted{{sfn|Thomson|1947|p=26}} and other stories such as an official statement from the Free French Information Service through the Ministry of Information saying that \"30,000 Germans drowning in an attempted embarkation last September\" were suppressed.{{sfn|Thomson|1947|p=71}} Vivid and plausible accounts of a thwarted invasion were published in American newspapers<ref>\n{{cite news\n | url        = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19410416&id=D8waAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cEwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3091,2879310\n | title      = Flaming Sea Foiled Nazi Invasion Attempt, Report\n | author     =\n | newspaper  = [[Pittsburgh Press|The Pittsburgh Press]]\n | date       = 16 April 1941\n | at         = p.8 column C\n | accessdate = 6 February 2013\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n | url        = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19440927&id=Gh8aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6yQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4008,4473730\n | title      = Asserts Bath of Fire Foiled Nazi Invasion\n | author     = John A.

With the accumulation of invasion barges and favourable tides the authorities were convinced that invasion was imminent, the codeword ''Cromwell'' was passed to the Army and Home Forces.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=276}}{{sfn|WWII Day-by-Day}} The codeword was only meant to indicate ''invasion imminent'', but with a nation tense with expectation and some Home Guardsmen incompletely briefed, some believed that the invasion had started and this caused great confusion.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=276}} In some areas, church bells were rung on receipt of the codeword even though this was only supposed to happen when invaders were in the immediate area.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=276}} Roadblocks were set up, some bridges blown and [[land mine]]s sown on some roads (killing 3 Guards officers). [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] units searched beaches for invasion barges and scanned the skies for approaching German paratroopers, but none came. Public recollection of these events did much to reinforce the idea that some kind of landing had in fact been attempted.\n\nThe burning sea lie provided the British with their first major [[black propaganda]] victory. The compelling story is likely to be the basis of a number of invasion myths that remained in circulation throughout the remainder of the 20th century: that the Germans attempted an invasion which was thwarted by the use of sea-burning bombs.{{sfn|Hayward|2001|loc=''passim''}} The most persistent of these stories becoming known as the [[Shingle Street|Shingle Street Mystery]] named after an isolated village on the Suffolk coast.{{sfn|Hayward|2001|loc=''passim''}}\n\n=== Flame barrage ===\n[[File:Invasion Defences in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H7019.jpg|thumb|right|A flame barrage demonstration on the sea at Studland Bay, Dorset]]\n\nPropaganda aside, the efforts of the PWD were real enough: they continued with experiments to actually set the sea on fire. Although initial tests were discouraging, [[Geoffrey Lloyd, Baron Geoffrey-Lloyd|Geoffrey Lloyd]] was reluctant to let the matter go.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=38}} On 24 August 1940, on the northern shores of the [[Solent]], near [[Titchfield]], ten tanker wagons began to pump oil down pipes running from the top of a thirty-foot (10 m) high cliff down into the water at the rate of about 12 tons per hour. In front of many spectators, the oil was ignited by flares and a system of sodium and petrol pellets.{{sfn|Banks|1946|pp=40\u201341}} In a matter of seconds, a raging wall of flame was produced; the intense heat caused the water to boil and people at the cliff edge were obliged to retreat. The demonstration was very dramatic,{{sfn|IWM Film WPN 220|loc=time: 0:19}} but it was not an unqualified success because the circumstances were improbably favourable: in the sheltered waters of the Solent, the sun-warmed sea was calm and the winds light.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=41}} A lengthy series of experiments continued with many reverses, in one case the pipes attached to ''[[admiralty scaffolding]]'' (an anti-tank barrier of scaffolding placed in the shallows) were torn up in a storm and in another incident [[sappers]] were blown up by beach mines. It was found that effectiveness was very much affected by sea conditions; a low temperature made ignition more difficult and waves would quickly break up the oil into small ineffectual slicks.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=42}}\n\nOn 20 December 1940, Field Marshals [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Alexander]] and [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]] and many other senior officers gathered for a demonstration. The performance was completely unconvincing with just a few small pools of burning oil battered by the surf. The cold, cloudy weather matched the mood of pessimism; Banks describes this day as the Black Friday in the annals of the Petroleum Warfare Department.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=42}}\n\nGeneral Alexander was sympathetic to the PWD's problems and suggested that the pipes be moved to a point immediately above the high tide point and, after several months of further work this proved to be the solution \u2013 oil sprayed and burnt over rather than on the water.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=42}}{{sfn|IWM Film WPN 220|loc=time: 1:35}} On 24 February 1941 the Chiefs of Staff committee, that included General Brooke, watched films of the recent experiments and approved the installation of fifty miles of flame barrage: twenty five miles on the south-eastern coast, fifteen miles on the Eastern and ten miles on the southern commands.{{sfn|Alanbrooke|2001|loc=Entry: 24 February 1941}}\n\nAlthough Geoffrey Lloyd, Secretary for Petroleum, was enthusiastic, General Brooke was, on reflection, not convinced of its efficacy. Brooke's main objections were that the weapon was dependent upon favourable winds, it created a smokescreen that might favour the enemy and that it was very vulnerable to bombing and shell fire; in any case, it was of short duration.{{sfn|NA WO 193/734}} The required resources were considerable and there was a serious shortage of materials; lack of support from authorities and the competing demands for supplies meant that the plans were cut back to thirty miles of barrage, then fifteen{{sfn|NA CAB 79|loc=COS(41) 314th Meeting}} and then less than ten miles.{{sfn|Banks|1946|pp=45\u201346}} According to Banks: \"Lengths of this flame defence ultimately were completed at [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] between [[Kingsdown, Kent|Kingsdown]] and [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], at [[St Margaret's at Cliffe|St. Margaret's Bay]], at [[White Cliffs of Dover|Shakespeare Cliff]] near [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway#Tunnels|Dover railway tunnel]], at [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] where a remarkable system of remote control across the marshes was installed, and at [[Studland Bay]].

Banks had seen the [[Livens Large Gallery Flame Projector]] used at the Somme in July 1916 and a large scale flamethrower had been installed on [[HMS Vindictive (1897)|HMS ''Vindictive'']] and used in the [[Zeebrugge Raid|raid on Zeebrugge]].{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=62}} Portable flamethrowing apparatus was also designed but the war ended before it could be fully employed; further development ceased and records of the work were lost.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=62}}\n\nWork restarted in 1939 at the newly formed [[Ministry of Supply]] Research Department at [[Woolwich]] and many of the basic technical problems were investigated such as the design of valves and nozzles, the problem of ignition, and of fuels and propellants.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=62}} Independently Commander Marsden was working on portable flamethrowers for the Army.{{sfn|Banks|1946|pp=62\u201363}} His work eventually resulted in the semi-portable \"Harvey\" flamethrower and the backpack \"Marsden\" flamethrower. Meanwhile, the PWD developed the Home Guard Flamethrower as a quickly extemporised weapon.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=65}}\n\n=== Home Guard Flamethrower ===\nThe so-called Home Guard Flamethrower was not a flamethrower in the conventional sense, but a small, semi-mobile flame trap.\n\nFrom about September 1940, 300 [[Home Guard (United Kingdom)|Home Guard]] units received a kit of parts provided by the PWD: a {{convert|50|to|65|impgal|l}} barrel, {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=off}} of hose, a hand pump, some connective plumbing and a set of do-it-yourself instructions.{{sfn|Weeks|1975|p=49}}{{sfn|Clarke|2011|p=175}} The barrel was set upon an {{convert|8+1/2|ft|m|spell=in|adj=mid|-long}} hand cart that was made locally from [[wikt:four by two|four by two]] inch timber and mounted on a pair of wheels salvaged from a car axle. The nozzle and ground spike were of simple construction from sections of three-quarter-inch diameter gas pipe with a used food can over the end to catch drips of fuel that would maintain a flame when the pressure was allowed to drop. When completed, the weapon was filled with a 40/60 mixture obtained locally.\n\nThe Home Guard Flame Thrower was light enough to be wheeled along roads and possibly over fields to where it was needed by its crew of five to six men. It would be used as part of an ambush in combination with Molotov cocktails and whatever other weapons were available. The pump was operated by hand and would give a flame of up to {{convert|60|ft|m|spell=in}} in length \u2013 but only for about two minutes of continuous operation.{{sfn|IWM K98/152}}{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=64-67}}{{sfn|IWM Film MGH 6799|loc=time: 4:07}}\n\n=== Harvey flamethrower ===\n{{multiple image\n | image1    = Harvey Flame Thrower transport diagram.jpg\n | alt1      = Harvey Flame Thrower transport diagram.\n | caption1  = Transport\n | width1    = 100\n | image2    = Harvey Flame Thrower use diagram.jpg\n | alt2      = Harvey Flame Thrower in use diagram.\n | caption2  = In use\n | width2    = 373\n | footer    = Harvey Flame Thrower\n}}\n\nThe Harvey flamethrower was introduced in August 1940, it was mostly made from readily available parts such as wheels from agricultural equipment manufacturers and commercially available compressed air cylinders.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=273}} It comprised a welded steel cylinder containing 22 gallons (100 l) of [[creosote]] and a standard bottle of compressed [[nitrogen]] at {{convert|1,800|psi|bar}} mounted on a [[sack truck]] of the type that a railway station porter might use. {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=off}} of [[Metal hose|armoured hose]] provided the connection to a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|spell=in|-long}} lance with a nozzle and some [[Kerosene|paraffin]] soaked cotton waste that was set alight to provide a source of ignition.

The first product of this work was a prototype of Cockatrice that was demonstrated in August 1940.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=69}} Reginald Fraser of [[Imperial College]], [[London University]], who was also a director of the [[Lagonda|Lagonda car company]], developed an annular flamethrower, that threw petrol with an outer layer of thickened fuel. He thought that this would reduce the risk of fire working backwards to the fuel tank because oxygen would not be present.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=67}} With the encouragement of the PWD, Fraser produced and demonstrated a prototype at [[Snoddington|Snoddington Furze]] in August 1940. Fraser went on and had an experimental vehicle put together by Lagonda on a [[Commer]] lorry chassis.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=67}} A demonstration of the Lagonda vehicle at PWD's test site at Moody Down farm near [[Winchester]] was attended by [[Nevil Shute Norway]] and Lieutenant Jack Cooke of the Admiralty [[Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development]].{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=45}} Norway later recalled \"It was a terrifying apparatus&nbsp;... [It] fired a mixture of diesel oil and tar and had a range of about a hundred yards. It had a flame thirty feet in diameter and used eight gallons of fuel a second&nbsp;... When demonstrated to admirals and generals it usually appalled and horrified them&nbsp;...\"{{efn|Norway quoted by Pawle.{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=45}}}}\n\nNorway understood that invading airborne troops landing at an airfield would need about one minute after touch-down while they prepared their equipment, in which time they would be extremely vulnerable; a flamethrower on a vehicle that could be driven at speed could envelop the enemy in fire before the vehicle itself was destroyed.{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=45}} Cooke worked on the problem and the result was ''Cockatrice''.{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=45}}{{sfn|IWM Film WPN 220|loc=time: 2:58}} This device had a rotating weapon mount with elevation to 90 degrees and a range of about {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}}, stored about two tons of fuel and used compressed carbon monoxide as a propellant.{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=45}}{{sfn|IWM Film MGH 6799|loc=time: 5:25}} The ''Light Cockatrices'' variant was based on an armoured [[Bedford QL]] vehicle with flame\u2013projector; sixty of these were ordered for the protection of [[Royal Naval Air Station]]s.{{sfn|Banks|1946|p=74}} The ''Heavy Cockatrice'' was based on the larger [[AEC Matador]] 6\u00d76 chassis already in RAF service as a fuel bowser; six of these were constructed for RAF airfield defence. Other than having a larger fuel tank the ''Heavy Cockatrice'' was the same vehicle. The Army showed little interest in ''Cockatrice'' and it never went into mass production.{{sfn|Fletcher|2007|pp=3\u20136}}{{efn|The Cockatrice vehicle weighed over twelve tons and was very difficult to bring to a sudden stop. In one notable incident, when returning from trials and on turning at a bend in the road, a driver found his way blocked by temporary barrier. Unable to stop, the driver crashed through the roadblock and the soldiers guarding the barrier opened fire. Incensed, the cockatrice crew retaliated with a jet of fire resulting in \"an eventful few moments\".{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=46}}}}\n\nThe flamethrower from Cockatrice was also deployed on a number of small ships. German pilots were in the habit of attacking coastal vessels, flying in very low hoping to avoid detection and dropping their bombs before flying over the ship at mast height.{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=46}} Norway thought that a vertical flamethrower might discourage such attacks. An experiment with a Cockatrice-like flamethrower on board ''La Patrie'', the flame's length was increased by the up-draft of the heat generated so that the pillar of fire reached {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=on}} vertically.{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=46}} A pilot was found to make dummy attacks, flying closer and closer with each pass he eventually had his wingtip virtually in the flame.{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=47}} Norway was disheartened to find that the pilot was not more deterred by the flames but the pilot had been briefed to know what to expect. In a later trial with a pilot who had not been told about the flame weapon, Norway was dismayed to see that he flew with half a wing cutting into the flame. It transpired that this pilot had worked for a stunt firm and he was used to driving cars \"through plates of glass and walls of fire\".{{sfn|Pawle|1956|p=47}} Despite these discouraging results, the flamethrower was installed on a number of coastal vessels.

The Wasps were used mainly in support of infantry operations, whereas the Crocodile was used with armoured formations.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=272}} They were extremely effective weapons, dreaded by the Germans who had to bear their effects; because of the fear of these flamethrowers, infantry opposition often ceased when they arrived. {{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=272}} It was not long before the Wasp Mk IIs were joined by yet another Wasp variant, this one having been developed by the Canadians and denoted Mk IIC. The Canadians had determined that devoting a Universal Carrier exclusively to the flamethrower role was inefficient and they redesigned the Wasp so that the carrier could also function in its normal manner.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=272}} This was achieved by removing the internal fuel tanks and replacing them with a single tank externally mounted at the back of the vehicle.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=272}} This allowed room inside for a third crew member who could carry a light machine gun.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=272}} The Mk IIC was much more tactically flexible and it gradually became the favoured type.{{sfn|Bishop|2002|p=272}}{{sfn|Swettenham|1968|pp=169\u2013171}} In June 1944 all Wasp production was changed to the Mk IIC and existing MK IIs were also adapted to this standard.

This meant that it could not be stored as a coil in the hold of a cable laying ship where each turn of the coil would require a 360\u00b0 twist in the pipe as it was laid. A ship was fitted out with a large wheel allowing pipe to be wound and unwound without twisting.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=36}} Renamed HMS ''Persephone'', this ship laid pipes from the British mainland to the [[Isle of Wight]], this served as an trial run and pipes laid provided a vital link in the oil pipeline network.<ref>{{cite web\n | url        = https://www.flickr.com/photos/31834495@N08/3054484146/\n | title      = H.M.S.

Pumping stations were established at [[Shanklin]] and at [[Sandown]] and collectively known by the codename BAMBI. Shanklin was, as it is today, a popular [[seaside resort]] at [[Sandown Bay]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].

Vital lessons had been learned from earlier experience and the difficulties in making the shore connections were overcome.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=66}} However, worsening weather and waning official enthusiasm dampened progress. Fuel pumping was delayed until 27 October and by December only four HAIS pipe were working and these had to run at a relatively low pressure resulting in daily delivery of just 700 tons of fuel.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=66}} Despite official doubts, PLUTO continued. HAMEL pipe was more difficult to bring ashore and especially so in poor weather; the problem was solved by adding lengths of HAIS pipe onto the ends of a HAMEL pipeline as it was wound onto a ''conundrum'' greatly simplifying shore connection.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=69}}\n\nSeventeen pipelines were laid from Dungeness to Boulogne of which up to 11 were working until the end of the war.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=69}} This route had a capacity of {{convert|1350000|impgal|USgal l}} per day and regularly delivered more than {{convert|1000000|impgal|USgal l}} daily {{sfn|Searle|1995|p=69}}  Although this delivery rate was impressive, it actually represented little more than 10% of fuel transported across the Channel and this was achieved too late to have any impact on the campaign.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=76}} The pipelines were not designed to last long, the steel HAMEL pipes generally succumbed to friction with the sea bed within a few weeks and the HAIS pipes lasted only a little longer.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=76}}\n\nPluto was blighted by the bad luck such as the delays capturing Cherbourg and an inability to translate the results of trials into reality quickly enough to keep up with the fighting.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=76}} Things could have turned out differently and nothing should be allowed to subtract from the impressive technical achievement under very difficult circumstances.{{sfn|Searle|1995|pp=77\u201378}}\n\n\"In retrospect, it seems clear that PLUTO's advocates had been far too sanguine. They had assumed that it would be possible for the naval laying units to achieve immediately the degree of technical proficiency attained by the technically expert laying parties in the trials conducted in 1943 under the supervision of those who had designed the equipment; and that what could be done in the Bristol Channel and the Solent could be done in wartime operational conditions on the much longer lay across the Channel\"{{efn|DJ Payton-Smith quoted by Searle.{{sfn|Searle|1995|pp=77\u201378}} }}\n\n=== Recovery ===\n\nPLUTO ceased operation in July 1945, just a few months after the end of fighting in Europe.{{sfn|Searle|1995|p=69}}{{sfn|Knight|Smith|Barnett|1998|p=27}} Because the pipes were a hazard to shipping, the Royal Navy cut the pipe and removed sections that were just a few miles offshore.{{sfn|Knight|Smith|Barnett|1998|p=27}} Starting in August 1946, the former HMS ''Latimer'' was used in a private salvage operation.{{sfn|Knight|Smith|Barnett|1998|p=27}} The first part of the operation used a [[Grapple (tool)|grapple]] to find a pipeline and haul it up and onto the ship's bow.{{sfn|Knight|Smith|Barnett|1998|p=27}}\n\nHAIS was found to be in good condition and its high lead content made salvage particularly valuable; each pipe could be cut just once and then coiled in the ship's hold. Lengths of HAIS pipes were cleared of petrol and cut into lengths suitable for transportation by rail.{{sfn|PLUTO \u2013 The Salvage Operation}} These short lengths were sent to [[Swansea]] where the recovered lead was melted and cast into [[ingots]]; the wires were straightened and used as [[rebars]]; the steel tapes were flatted and used to make corner reinforcements for heavy duty cardboard boxes; and the jute was made into blocks that could be burned as fuel in a furnace.{{sfn|PLUTO \u2013 The Salvage Operation}}\n\nThe HAMEL pipes were also valuable, but being less flexible, needed to be cut into lengths on the deck of the recovery ship.{{sfn|Knight|Smith|Barnett|1998|p=27}} Cutting either type of pipeline was very dangerous because the pipes still contained petrol.{{sfn|PLUTO \u2013 The Salvage Operation}} The contaminated petrol from both types of pipe was recovered and cleaned up, yielding some {{convert|66000|impgal|USgal l}} of useful fuel.{{sfn|PLUTO \u2013 The Salvage Operation}}\n\nThe salvage operation lasted three years. Of the 25,000 tons of lead and steel originally used, 22,000 tons were recovered.{{sfn|Knight|Smith|Barnett|1998|p=27}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation ==\n[[File:IWM-CH-15271-FIDO-Lancaster-Gravely.jpg|thumb|right|FIDO at Graveley, Huntingdonshire, as an [[Avro Lancaster]] of [[No. 35 Squadron RAF]] takes off in deteriorating weather, 28 May 1945.]]\n\n{{main|Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation}}\n\nFrom the beginning of the war it became evident that many aircraft were being lost in accidents during landing in unfavourable weather. Fog was a particularly serious hazard, settling unpredictably over airfields where tired, possibly injured, pilots in aeroplanes short of fuel and in some cases damaged, had to land.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=2}} The night of 16/17 October 1940 was particularly unfortunate. In raids by 73 bombers three aircraft were shot down but ten crashed on landing. When this was brought to the attention of Prime Minister Churchill he demanded that something be done: \"...&nbsp;It ought to be possible to guide them down quite safely as commercial craft were before the war in spite of fog. Let me have full particulars. The accidents last night are very serious\"{{efn|Churchill quoted by Williams.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=2}} }}\n\nPreviously Professor [[David Brunt]] of [[Imperial College London]] had calculated that if the temperature of a volume of fog were raised by about {{convert|5|F-change|0}} it would evaporate. Some preliminary experiments had been conducted between 1936 and 1939 using burners based on agricultural sprayers and a fuel that was a mixture of petrol and alcohol. Although the heat generated was not sufficient to clear a substantial volume of fog, the feasibility of the method was established. However, no further development took place.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=3}}\n\nAs the bomber offensive grew in scale, more aircraft flew ever greater distances and more accidents followed. Despite Churchill's injunction, no measures being taken to reduce the losses caused by bad weather. Eventually, in September 1941 [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Charles Portal]], [[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]] and [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Lord Cherwell]], Churchill's scientific advisor, recommended that the pre-war fog dispersal work should be resumed.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=3}} However, the idea met with resistance and Cherwell later reluctantly recommended postponement.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=4}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"I am persuaded that the procedure which offers the best chance of rapid progress in fog clearance is to entrust the experimental work to the Petroleum Warfare Dept. Mr Geoffrey Lloyd, the Minister for Petroleum, is prepared to undertake it. The department has experience in dealing with analogous problems and they have a certain amount of plant and equipment which would enable them to get to work at once. Lord Cherwell agrees that this is the best line of action \u2013 indeed, the suggestion came from him. It would help Mr Lloyd if you would send him a Minute authorizing him to proceed!\" \u2014 [[Secretary of State for Air]], [[Archibald Sinclair]], September 1942.{{efn|Archibald Sinclair quoted by Williams.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=4}} }}\n| width = 35%\n| align=right\n}}\n\nBy September 1942 it was realised that not only were many aircraft being unnecessarily lost but that sustained operations were being limited by considerations of the weather. [[Secretary of State for Air]], [[Archibald Sinclair]] recommended that PWD undertake fog dispersal trials. Within 24 hours, a personal minute was on Geoffrey Lloyd's desk: \"It is of the greatest importance to find a means to dissipate fog at aerodromes so that aircraft can land safely. Let full experiments to this end be put in hand by the Petroleum Warfare Department with all expedition. They should be given every possible support. W.S.C.\"{{efn|Churchill quoted by Williams.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=5}} }}\n\n[[Geoffrey Lloyd, Baron Geoffrey-Lloyd|Geoffrey Lloyd]], [[Donald Banks]], [[Arthur Hartley]] (chief engineer of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company), and [[Edward George Walker]] a civil and aeronautical engineer, and others, met. Lloyd visited fruit farmers who used [[Smudge pot]] heaters to protect their crops;{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=8}} Hartley arranged for a part of the [[King George VI Reservoir]] that had been left empty for the duration of the war to be used for experiments;{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=8}} and Walker took to long walks on foggy nights wearing a government issue [[donkey jacket]] \u2013 much to the puzzlement of his family.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=7}} Experiments were quickly put in hand with large scale tests taking place in the reservoir and smaller scale tests in a disused indoor [[ice rink]] at [[Earls Court]]{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=8}} where a wind tunnel was set up so that a wide range of weather conditions could be simulated.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=11}}\n\nIn some of the earliest experiments, Wasp flame throwers were used.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=14}} A Cockatrice in thick fog fired six {{frac|1|1|2}} second busts which cleared the air in its immediate vicinity.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=14}}\n\nThe first purpose designed burner was known as ''Four-Oaks'' used a mixture of petrol and alcohol, but it was not possible to obtain a smokeless flame.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=14}} On 4 November 1942 a test was performed with two rows of Four-Oaks burners {{convert|200|yd|m}} long and {{convert|100|yd|m}} apart. A fireman went up an escape ladder borrowed for the experiments and he disappeared into the gloom after climbing just a few rungs. As the burners got going he reappeared at the top of the {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} ladder only to disappear again when the burners were turned off.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=16}} Unfortunately, the Four-Oaks burner produced as much smoke as it cleared fog and did not produce a really satisfactory degree of heating. Experiments with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] burners worked better, at least initially,{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=16}} but they could not be controlled and caused smoke and other problems.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=17\u201319}}\n\nA new burner called ''Haigas'' (later known as the Mark I) was developed. Haigas used petrol which was preheated to form a vapour before it was burnt, thereby significantly increasing efficiency and reducing smoke.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=19\u201320}} An experimental system was installed at [[Graveley, Cambridgeshire|Graveley]], Cambridgeshire and was tested for the first time on 18 February 1943 in poor visibility, although not thick fog.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=19\u201320}} The pilot, [[Air commodore]] [[Don Bennett]], commander of the [[Pathfinder (RAF)|RAF Pathfinder Force]], said \"I had vague thoughts of seeing lions jumping through a hoop of flames at the circus. The glare was certainly considerable and there was some runway turbulence, but it was nothing to worry about.\"{{efn|Air commodore Bennett quoted by Williams.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=20}} }} Graveley became the first operational FIDO site and the system was rapidly expanded.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=20\u201323}}\n\nThe Haigas (or Mark I) burner was {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and comprised four connected lengths of pipe held just above ground level. The pipes ran back and forth in close proximity along the burner's length. After traversing the length of the burner three times, the petrol flowed into the fourth length of pipe: a burner pipe that was pierced with holes. The circuitous route of the fuel allowed it to be heated and vaporised by the heat of burners, this was done so that it would burn efficiently and without producing significant amounts of smoke.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=17}}\n\nLater burner designs called the ''Haigill'' system and designated Mark II to Mark VI were simpler and more efficient, requiring only three lengths of pipe. Earlier versions of Haigill used two runs of evaporator pipe and one burner pipe, later versions used one run of evaporator pipe and two burner pipes.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=24}}\n\nLater still, the ''Hairpin'' burner was developed, it had one length of evaporator pipe immediately above one length of burner pipe. Hairpin was set in a specially shaped [[cast-iron]] trough in a heat-resistant concrete trench that was then covered in a grid of steel bars at ground level.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=29\u201330}} This design did not generate any more heat than the earlier versions, but was much less intrusive upon air operations.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=29\u201330}} Yet more sophisticated designs followed along similar lines.{{sfn|Williams|1995|pp=30\u201335}}\n\nThe value of FIDO is difficult to estimate. Approximately 700 aircraft landed with FIDO operating in foggy conditions and about 2,000 landed with FIDO being used allowing the runway to be identified in conditions of limited visibility.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=41}} Some 3,500 aircrew owe their lives to FIDO and for perhaps 10,000 others a serious situation made easier.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=41}} The FIDO system was briefly used commercially. It was intended to be used at [[London Heathrow Airport]] and small sections were put in place.{{sfn|Hansard \u2013 FIDO Abandonment}} However, advances in various landing systems made FIDO redundant.{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=29-30}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:PLUTO Pump Sandown Isle of Wight.jpg|thumb|right|PLUTO Pump at Sandown Zoo on the Isle of Wight]]\n\nWhen the war in Europe was nearly won, the activities of the Petroleum Warfare Department were widely publicised as being demonstrative of British ingenuity.{{sfn|Times 4 June 1945}}{{sfn|Popular Science August 1945}} [[Newsreel]]s told the British public how flamethrower weapons had been developed to defend the country against invasion{{sfn|Path\u00e9 News: Flame Throwers}}{{sfn|Path\u00e9 News: Defence By Fire}} and how the PLUTO and FIDO projects had help win the war.{{sfn|Path\u00e9 News: Operation Pluto}}{{sfn|Path\u00e9 News: F.I.D.O.}}\n\nThe Petroleum Warfare Department planned a travelling exhibition of its achievements; the end of hostilities caused a change of plan: a temporary exhibition at the otherwise closed [[Imperial War Museum]].

Created by [[John Broome (writer)|John Broome]] and [[Carmine Infantino]], he made his debut in ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'' #139 (September 1963).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Korte |first3=Steve |last4=Manning |first4=Matt |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |last6=Wilson |first6=Sven |title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia: The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe |date=2016 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-5357-0 |page=238}}</ref> The most well-known character to assume the \"Reverse-Flash\" mantle, Thawne is the [[archenemy]] of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] (the second superhero to be called the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]]), a descendant of [[Cobalt Blue (comics)|Malcolm Thawne]], and a [[Maternal bond|maternal]] [[Ancestor|forefather]] of [[Bart Allen]], [[Reverse-Flash#Thaddeus Thawne|Thaddeus Thawne]], and [[Captain Boomerang#Owen Mercer|Owen Mercer]]. He has been established as one of the fastest speedsters in the [[DC Universe]].\n\n[[Tom Cavanagh]] and [[Matt Letscher]] have portrayed the character on various [[television series]] set within [[the CW]]'s [[live action]] [[Arrowverse]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[File:The Flash (vol. 1) -139.jpg|thumb|left|Eobard Thawne's debut as seen on the cover of ''The Flash'' #139 (September 1963).]]\nEobard Thawne found a [[time capsule]] in the 25th century containing a costume of the Flash (Barry Allen) and with a Tachyon device amplified the suit's speed energy, giving himself speedster abilities. Reversing the costume's colors, he adopted the moniker of \"Professor Zoom the Reverse-Flash\" and went on a crime spree.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wells |first=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1960-64 |date=2015 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490458 |page=125}}</ref> However, the time capsule also contained an [[atomic clock]], and to prevent a nuclear explosion, Flash pursued and defeated Zoom, hoping he knew where the clock was. Unfortunately he did not, but Flash later found the clock, detonated it safely, and destroyed Thawne's costume.<ref name=\"vol1no139\">{{cite comic|Title = [[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]|Volume = 1|Issue = #139|Date = September 1963|Publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}</ref>\n\nBlaming the Flash for his defeat, Thawne became obsessed with \"replacing\" Barry and traveled back in time to exact his revenge. When [[Iris West]] (Barry's wife) rejected his romantic pursuits, Thawne killed Iris. After Flash had found love again, Thawne threatened to kill Fiona Webb (Barry's new fianc\u00e9) on their wedding day. Fearful that history was repeating itself, Barry killed Thawne by breaking his neck.<ref name=f324>''Flash'' #324 (August 1983)</ref>\n\n===Post-''Crisis'' and ''Zero Hour'' origin===\nThe Post-''Crisis'' extended origin storyline \"The Return of Barry Allen\" revealed that Thawne was once a scientist obsessed with the Flash, even undergoing [[Plastic surgery#Cosmetic surgery procedures|cosmetic surgery]] to resemble his hero. Obtaining the [[Cosmic Treadmill]] from an antique shop, Thawne gained all of the Flash's powers after replicating the electrochemical accident that created the Flash. Seeking to use the Cosmic Treadmill to travel back in time and meet his idol, Thawne arrived at the [[Flash Museum]] several years after Barry's death, discovering that he was destined to become Professor Zoom the Reverse-Flash and die at his idol's hands. As a result, the unstable Thawne convinced himself that he was Barry and subsequently attacked Central City for \"forgetting him\". [[Wally West]] ultimately tricked Thawne into returning to the 25th century with no memory of the incident. Despite this, Thawne still managed to bring the remains of his older self's costume with him, cluing him further into his destiny.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #74\u201379 (March\u2013August 1993)</ref>\n\nAfter the events of ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!]]'', it is revealed that [[List of Flash enemies#Cobalt Blue|Malcolm Thawne]] is Eobard Thawne's ancestor and Barry's long-lost twin brother, meaning that Barry is Thawne's great-uncle.\n\n===''The Flash: Rebirth''===\n{{Main|The Flash: Rebirth}}\nIn 2009, Thawne was re-imagined as a major villain in the [[DC Universe]] by writer [[Geoff Johns]] in ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]''.<ref>''Flash: Rebirth'' outline in the hardcover collection of the story</ref> His resurrection is foreshadowed to occur in a [[Blackest Night|near-future event]].<ref name=\"tfr1\">''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009).

DC Comics</ref>\n\nWhen Thawne reappears, he murders the revived [[Johnny Quick (Johnny Chambers)|Johnny Quick]],<ref name=\"tfr3\">''The Flash: Rebirth'' #3 (June 2009). DC Comics</ref> before proceeding to trap Barry and the revived [[Max Mercury]] inside the negative Speed Force. Thawne then attempts to kill Wally's children through their Speed Force connection in front of [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park-West]], only to be stopped by [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Bart Allen]]. Thawne defeats Jay and prepares to kill Bart, but Barry, Max, Wally, [[Jesse Quick]] and Impulse arrive to prevent the villain from doing so.<ref name=\"tfr4\" /><ref name=\"tfr5\">''The Flash: Rebirth'' #5 (November 2009). DC Comics</ref> In the ensuing fight, Thawne reveals that he is responsible for every tragedy that has occurred in Barry's life, including the death of [[Nora Allen]] (Barry's mother). Thawne then decides to destroy everything the Flash holds dear by killing Iris before they even met.<ref name=\"tfr5\" />\n\nAs Barry chases after Thawne, Wally joins Barry in the time barrier. They reach Thawne and in doing so, they become the lightning bolt that turns Barry into the Flash as they are able to stop Thawne from killing Iris. The Flashes push Thawne back through time, showing his past and future. They return to the present, where the Justice League, the Justice Society, and the Outsiders have built a device originally intended to disconnect Barry from the Speed Force as the Black Flash. Barry tosses Thawne in and Jay activates the device, severing his connection to the negative Speed Force. As the Flashes tie him up to stop him from running, Iris discovers Thawne's weapon back in the past, which she keeps.<ref name=\"tfr6\">''The Flash: Rebirth'' #6 (February 2010). DC Comics</ref>\n\nIn the present, he is imprisoned in [[Iron Heights Penitentiary|Iron Heights]]. [[Hunter Zolomon]] speaks to him, saying they can help each other be better. In [[Gorilla City]], one of the apes warns that Professor Zoom has done something horrible to their jungles, but just what he has done is something even they do not know.<ref name=\"tfr6\" />\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\nIn the 2009\u20132010 storyline \"[[Blackest Night]]\", the Pre-''Crisis'' version of Thawne's broken-necked corpse is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. The [[Power ring (weapon)|black power ring]] downloaded the corpse's memories, resulting in him not knowing of Barry's death and resurrection.

DC Comics</ref>\n\nIn the follow-up \"[[Brightest Day]]\" storyline, the present Professor Zoom is still imprisoned in Iron Heights.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #0 (April 2010). DC Comics</ref> When [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] activates the White Power Battery, the [[White Lantern Corps|Entity]] speaks to the 12 heroes and villains resurrected at the climax of the \"Blackest Night\" and tells each of them of their mission that must be accomplished in order to restore 'life' to the universe and prevent the Blackest Night from ever recurring. Zoom becomes the first to inadvertently fulfill his mission, which occurred in the events of ''The Flash: Rebirth'' when he freed Allen from the Speed Force following the resurrection. The Entity proclaims Zoom has completed his task and his life is restored to him, later revealing that Zoom (having fulfilled his task) is now fully purged of all trace remnants of his Black Lantern ties \u2013 both present and future.<ref>''Brightest Day'' #7 (August 2010). DC Comics</ref> Zoom is released from Iron Heights by Captain Boomerang, who had hoped to better understand his version of the Entity's message. Zoom does not answer him directly, giving a cryptic response and eventually escaping as [[Captain Boomerang]] is confronted by the rest of the Rogues.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #7 (December 2010). DC Comics</ref>\n\n===Post-''Infinite Crisis'' origin===\nThawne uses his powers to completely [[Retroactive continuity|rewrite]] his own history; he erases his younger brother from existence and kills his parents when they try to interfere with his research.<ref name=\"tf8\">''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #8 (February 2011). DC Comics</ref>Thawne later falls in love with a reporter who had been hired to interview him, thus his future self wipes all of the reporter's romantic interests from existence. After finding out his would-be love interest did not return his affections, Thawne's future self traumatized the reporter as a child, causing the woman to be mute and institutionalized so that they never met each other.<ref name=\"tf8\" /> He later had his younger self find the time capsule containing Barry's costume to make himself the Flash of the 25th century. He sheds a tear as his altered past self runs past him while saying \"It won't last long. You will never find love. You will never be the Flash. Barry Allen destroyed my future. It's time I destroyed his.\".\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\nIn the 2011 ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' storyline, a new timeline is created through the [[Alternate history|alteration of history]].<ref>Johns, Geoff (w). \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\", ''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #10 \u2013 12 (April \u2013 May 2011). DC Comics</ref> The Reverse-Flash reveals that his body is permanently connected to the Speed Force, enabling him to create a negative version, with which he escaped prison. He was unable to alter Barry's transformation into the Flash, however, as that would effectively erase himself from existence. Instead, Thawne decides to ruin Barry's life during the latter's childhood, killing his mother, Nora. <ref name=\"fprf\">''Flashpoint: Reverse-Flash'' one-shot (June 2011). DC Comics</ref> Thawne later reveals that the Flashpoint timeline was created when Barry went back in time to stop the Reverse-Flash from killing Nora. After Thawne is killed by this reality's [[Batman (Thomas Wayne)|Batman]] with a shot to the head, the Flash travels back in time to stop Barry's younger self from altering history but instead, under [[Pandora (DC Comics)|Pandora]]'s manipulations, a [[The New 52|third, new timeline]] is created, in which DC Comics' continuity takes place from 2011 onward.<ref>Johns, Geoff (w).

DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIf you are reading this you suck ar minecraft.\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nIn the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' relaunch, Professor Zoom first appears in Barry's Speed Force vision, where the latter snaps Thawne's neck as he once did in his Pre-''Crisis'' history.<ref>''DC Universe: Rebirth'' one-shot (May 2016)</ref><ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' one-shot (June 2016)</ref> He is subsequently featured in another vision where he taunts Barry about the future.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #9</ref> The serial-killing speedster [[Godspeed (comics)|Godspeed]] later attempts to kill Thawne and every other inmate at Iron Heights as a twisted gesture of friendship to Barry, only to be stopped by the hero.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #8</ref> Sometime later, Thawne's memories of his Pre-''New 52'' self are restored after a mysterious wave of energy strikes him, and he recalls being killed by Batman (Thomas Wayne) during ''Flashpoint''.<ref name=\"The Flash vol. 5 #19\">''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #19</ref> Seeking to teach the Dark Knight's son a lesson, Thawne attacks Bruce Wayne in the [[Batcave]] and destroys Thomas's letter as retribution. Thawne brutally beats and verbally taunts Bruce before picking up [[Watchmen|the Comedian's smiley-face pin]], which teleports him away to an unknown location. Thawne is then teleported back to the Batcave, having been bathed in radiation by a [[Doctor Manhattan|mysterious entity]]. As he collapses, Thawne says \"God...I saw...God.\"<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 3) #21</ref> [[Batman]] and the Flash come across Thawne in possession of the Button shortly before his apparent death, and follow him in an attempt to prevent it.<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 3) #22</ref> As he follows the traces leading to the entity, Thawne muses that he may go back in time to raise his nemesis as a \"family friend\" after killing Nora, but he is seemingly killed and teleported back to the Batcave.<ref>''The Flash'' #22</ref> Thawne's corpse is subsequently taken to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] for further examination, but it is revealed that he was able to survive his near-death experience via his connection to the negative Speed Force, the energy of which grants him accelerated regeneration and healing. He is present at Iris's house when Iris arrives following Multiplex's attack at Barry's birthday party, shocking and terrifying the pair.<ref>''The Flash'' #23</ref>\n\nThawne brutally beats [[Wallace West (comics)|Wallace West]] whom he denounces as a fake, and then brings Iris to the future while Barry pursues them. Thawne shows the couple's future, and attempts to imprison Barry in the negative Speed Force. This backfires, as it leads to Barry absorbing the negative Speed Force power to strip Thawne of his speed. Barry declares that their rivalry is done, but Thawne vows that he will get back his powers and keep coming back to torment Barry before being seemingly killed by Iris with the Black Hole Gang's gun.\n\nThawne later returns (possibly resurrected after regaining his negative Speed Force connection) as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] that kidnapped [[Deathstroke]].\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nEobard Thawne already possessed [[genius]]-level intellect by the standards of the 25th Century even prior to gaining his [[metahuman]] abilities, making him possibly one of the smartest individuals when in the 21st century. ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' revealed that duplicating the accident behind [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]'s powers created a negative [[Speed Force]] by corrupting the positive version. The Reverse-Flash is therefore able to travel at superhuman speeds faster than the [[speed of light]], deliver blows of extreme force by hitting the victim hundreds of times a second, run on water, generate vacuums, create afterimages (\"speed mirages\") of himself, and vibrate his molecules to pass through solid objects. Unlike original Speed Force users, Thawne has the ability to travel through and manipulate time, being able to drastically alter history and completely erase people from existence (other speedsters cannot change the past without dramatic consequences). Thawne developed numerous new powers in the events leading up to ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'', including the ability to cross over to other dimensions, create shock waves across time and space at the snap of his fingers, absorb another's memories via physical contact, and alter the age of anyone or anything.<ref name=\"tf12\">''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #12 (May 2011). DC Comics</ref> Thawne has also displayed superhuman strength, as well as electrokinetic abilities. The presence of his lightning is able to disrupt and fry nearby electronics, in addition to allowing him to manipulate magnetism. During the ''[[The New 52|New 52]]'' reboot, Thawne gained the ability to slow down time similar to [[Hunter Zolomon]]. He retained his Pre-''New 52'' counterpart's age-altering abilities.<ref name=\"The Flash vol. 4 #45\">''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #45</ref> In the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' relaunch, however, Thawne regained his negative Speed Force connection and therefore all of his original powers.<ref name=\"The Flash vol. 5 #19\"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n===DC Animated Universe Comics===\nEobard Thawne, as the Reverse Flash, appears in ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' #6 (June 2002).\n\n===''Impulse''===\nIn an alternate timeline created when [[Bart Allen|Impulse]] kills an insect in the Devonian Age, most super-villains are government bureaucrats. Professor Zoom is the National Science Advisor to [[President for Life|President-for-Life]] Julian Tremain. In subsequent changes to the timeline, Zoom defected to the rebellion against Tremain led by [[Gorilla Grodd]]; turned into a gorilla fighting against an army of flying turtles led by Grodd, now a flying turtle himself; and was a gorilla in a modern society identical to that of ancient Egypt.<ref>''[[Bart Allen|Impulse]]'' #35.

He hires the [[Enemies of the Flash|Rogues]] to ambush the Flash ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]) at the [[Flash Museum]] before betraying them by placing explosives on their belts. The [[Justice League]] then arrive to disarm the bombs and apprehend Thawne. Barry travels back in time to prevent Nora Allen's murder and inadvertently [[Flashpoint (comics)|alters all of reality]], creating a world where [[Aquaman]]'s Atlantean army is at war with [[Wonder Woman]]'s Amazon forces.

Reversing the costume's colors, he adopted the moniker of \"Professor Zoom the Reverse-Flash\" and went on a crime spree.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wells |first=John |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1960-64 |date=2015 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490458 |page=125}}</ref> However, the time capsule also contained an [[atomic clock]], and to prevent a nuclear explosion, Flash pursued and defeated Zoom, hoping he knew where the clock was.

When [[Iris West]] (Barry's wife) rejected his romantic pursuits, Thawne killed Iris. After Flash had found love again, Thawne threatened to kill Fiona Webb (Barry's new fianc\u00e9) on their wedding day.

Obtaining the [[Cosmic Treadmill]] from an antique shop, Thawne gained all of the Flash's powers after replicating the electrochemical accident that created the Flash. Seeking to use the Cosmic Treadmill to travel back in time and meet his idol, Thawne arrived at the [[Flash Museum]] several years after Barry's death, discovering that he was destined to become Professor Zoom the Reverse-Flash and die at his idol's hands. As a result, the unstable Thawne convinced himself that he was Barry and subsequently attacked Central City for \"forgetting him\". [[Wally West]] ultimately tricked Thawne into returning to the 25th century with no memory of the incident. Despite this, Thawne still managed to bring the remains of his older self's costume with him, cluing him further into his destiny.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #74\u201379 (March\u2013August 1993)</ref>\n\nAfter the events of ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time!]]'', it is revealed that [[List of Flash enemies#Cobalt Blue|Malcolm Thawne]] is Eobard Thawne's ancestor and Barry's long-lost twin brother, meaning that Barry is Thawne's great-uncle.\n\n===''The Flash: Rebirth''===\n{{Main|The Flash: Rebirth}}\nIn 2009, Thawne was re-imagined as a major villain in the [[DC Universe]] by writer [[Geoff Johns]] in ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]''.<ref>''Flash: Rebirth'' outline in the hardcover collection of the story</ref> His resurrection is foreshadowed to occur in a [[Blackest Night|near-future event]].<ref name=\"tfr1\">''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009).

They return to the present, where the Justice League, the Justice Society, and the Outsiders have built a device originally intended to disconnect Barry from the Speed Force as the Black Flash. Barry tosses Thawne in and Jay activates the device, severing his connection to the negative Speed Force.

Zoom becomes the first to inadvertently fulfill his mission, which occurred in the events of ''The Flash: Rebirth'' when he freed Allen from the Speed Force following the resurrection.

He was unable to alter Barry's transformation into the Flash, however, as that would effectively erase himself from existence. Instead, Thawne decides to ruin Barry's life during the latter's childhood, killing his mother, Nora. <ref name=\"fprf\">''Flashpoint: Reverse-Flash'' one-shot (June 2011).

As a child, Thawne witnessed his father murder his mother and subsequently get arrested. One day, he is struck by lightning and gains the ability to control the flow of time around him, making it appear as if he is moving at superhuman speeds. Believing himself to have been \"chosen\" by the Speed Force as the Flash's replacement, Thawne dons a costume similar to the hero's and begins to terrorize the Gem Cities as \"Zoom\", demanding the citizens accept him as a king. However, he is enraged when people rebel against him in the Flash's name.<ref name=\"The Flash vol. 4 #47\">''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #47</ref> Jealous and bitter that the Flash is worshiped and loved by the people despite their similar powers, Thawne uses [[Rip Hunter]]'s notes to travel back in time, where he starts recruiting four individuals \"touched by the lightning\" (the Speed Force) across history, after \"saving\" them from situations he himself put them into under the false pretense that he requires their help in order to vanquish the \"evil menace\" of the Flash.<ref>''The Flash Annual'' (vol. 4) #4</ref>\n\nThawne then makes an acquaintance with Dr. [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Henry Allen|Henry Allen]] (Barry's father), funding Henry's research lab. But when Henry refuses to help him with an unknown cause, Zoom subsequently murders Nora in order to make Barry endure and give them both an \"equal start\", and forces Henry to take the blame for his deed, with the threat of Barry's life. Laying low for many years, Zoom reemerges following William Selkirk's defeat, recruiting as an \"acolyte\" of his. Zoom and his acolytes then cause havoc in the city and put the blame on the Flash, desiring to destroy his nemesis's legacy.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #40</ref>Thawne then kidnaps Henry when some inmates escape from prison in order to divert Thawne's attention away from Barry, and forces Henry to construct a power-stealing glove. But when his closest \"ally\" Magali (who has been keeping Thawne alive for centuries via powers) discover the truth about him, he uses the glove to steal Magali's abilities of affecting the age of organic and inorganic matter, leading to his true nature being exposed to the rest of his acolytes, who join forces with the Flash to destroy the device.\n\nAfter the failure of his plan to be a god, Zoom then takes Henry to the Allen house, with Barry in pursuit. Revealing his backstory to Barry, Thawne proceeds to best Barry in combat and is about to kill him until the Flash realizes how Thawne's powers work, and then proceeds to counter by moving time forward \u2013 finally defeating him. After talking Henry out of killing Thawne, Barry has him arrested and imprisoned at [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]].<ref name=\"The Flash vol. 4 #47\"/>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nIn the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' relaunch, Professor Zoom first appears in Barry's Speed Force vision, where the latter snaps Thawne's neck as he once did in his Pre-''Crisis'' history.<ref>''DC Universe: Rebirth'' one-shot (May 2016)</ref><ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' one-shot (June 2016)</ref> He is subsequently featured in another vision where he taunts Barry about the future.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #9</ref> The serial-killing speedster [[Godspeed (comics)|Godspeed]] later attempts to kill Thawne and every other inmate at Iron Heights as a twisted gesture of friendship to Barry, only to be stopped by the hero.<ref>''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #8</ref> Sometime later, Thawne's memories of his Pre-''New 52'' self are restored after a mysterious wave of energy strikes him, and he recalls being killed by Batman (Thomas Wayne) during ''Flashpoint''.<ref name=\"The Flash vol. 5 #19\">''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #19</ref> Seeking to teach the Dark Knight's son a lesson, Thawne attacks Bruce Wayne in the [[Batcave]] and destroys Thomas's letter as retribution.

Thawne is then teleported back to the Batcave, having been bathed in radiation by a [[Doctor Manhattan|mysterious entity]]. As he collapses, Thawne says \"God...I saw...God.\"<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 3) #21</ref> [[Batman]] and the Flash come across Thawne in possession of the Button shortly before his apparent death, and follow him in an attempt to prevent it.<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 3) #22</ref> As he follows the traces leading to the entity, Thawne muses that he may go back in time to raise his nemesis as a \"family friend\" after killing Nora, but he is seemingly killed and teleported back to the Batcave.<ref>''The Flash'' #22</ref> Thawne's corpse is subsequently taken to [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] for further examination, but it is revealed that he was able to survive his near-death experience via his connection to the negative Speed Force, the energy of which grants him accelerated regeneration and healing. He is present at Iris's house when Iris arrives following Multiplex's attack at Barry's birthday party, shocking and terrifying the pair.<ref>''The Flash'' #23</ref>\n\nThawne brutally beats [[Wallace West (comics)|Wallace West]] whom he denounces as a fake, and then brings Iris to the future while Barry pursues them. Thawne shows the couple's future, and attempts to imprison Barry in the negative Speed Force. This backfires, as it leads to Barry absorbing the negative Speed Force power to strip Thawne of his speed. Barry declares that their rivalry is done, but Thawne vows that he will get back his powers and keep coming back to torment Barry before being seemingly killed by Iris with the Black Hole Gang's gun.\n\nThawne later returns (possibly resurrected after regaining his negative Speed Force connection) as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]] that kidnapped [[Deathstroke]].\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nEobard Thawne already possessed [[genius]]-level intellect by the standards of the 25th Century even prior to gaining his [[metahuman]] abilities, making him possibly one of the smartest individuals when in the 21st century. ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' revealed that duplicating the accident behind [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]'s powers created a negative [[Speed Force]] by corrupting the positive version. The Reverse-Flash is therefore able to travel at superhuman speeds faster than the [[speed of light]], deliver blows of extreme force by hitting the victim hundreds of times a second, run on water, generate vacuums, create afterimages (\"speed mirages\") of himself, and vibrate his molecules to pass through solid objects. Unlike original Speed Force users, Thawne has the ability to travel through and manipulate time, being able to drastically alter history and completely erase people from existence (other speedsters cannot change the past without dramatic consequences). Thawne developed numerous new powers in the events leading up to ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'', including the ability to cross over to other dimensions, create shock waves across time and space at the snap of his fingers, absorb another's memories via physical contact, and alter the age of anyone or anything.<ref name=\"tf12\">''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #12 (May 2011). DC Comics</ref> Thawne has also displayed superhuman strength, as well as electrokinetic abilities. The presence of his lightning is able to disrupt and fry nearby electronics, in addition to allowing him to manipulate magnetism. During the ''[[The New 52|New 52]]'' reboot, Thawne gained the ability to slow down time similar to [[Hunter Zolomon]]. He retained his Pre-''New 52'' counterpart's age-altering abilities.<ref name=\"The Flash vol. 4 #45\">''The Flash'' (vol. 4) #45</ref> In the ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' relaunch, however, Thawne regained his negative Speed Force connection and therefore all of his original powers.<ref name=\"The Flash vol. 5 #19\"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n===DC Animated Universe Comics===\nEobard Thawne, as the Reverse Flash, appears in ''[[Justice League Adventures]]'' #6 (June 2002).\n\n===''Impulse''===\nIn an alternate timeline created when [[Bart Allen|Impulse]] kills an insect in the Devonian Age, most super-villains are government bureaucrats.

He hires the [[Enemies of the Flash|Rogues]] to ambush the Flash ([[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]) at the [[Flash Museum]] before betraying them by placing explosives on their belts. The [[Justice League]] then arrive to disarm the bombs and apprehend Thawne. Barry travels back in time to prevent Nora Allen's murder and inadvertently [[Flashpoint (comics)|alters all of reality]], creating a world where [[Aquaman]]'s Atlantean army is at war with [[Wonder Woman]]'s Amazon forces. Thawne also enters this reality via the Speed Force, saving [[Lois Lane]] from the Amazons to alert Barry of his presence. While [[Cyborg (DC Comics)|Cyborg]]'s [[Secret Six (comics)|metahuman team]] tries to put an end to the war, Thawne appears and subdues Barry. As the Atlanteans' [[Captain Atom|doomsday device]] destroys the world, Thawne is shot in the head by [[Batman (Thomas Wayne)|Batman]], thus allowing the Flash to tap into the Speed Force once more to stop Barry's past self from altering time, effectively creating a [[The New 52|new reality]] similar to the original.\n* Thawne returns as the main antagonist in ''[[Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay]]'' (2018), set in the new reality. It is revealed that Thawne managed to stretch his last moments before death by months, consolidating his speed to keep himself alive despite having a gaping gunshot wound in his head from Batman's gun, and was able to use the Speed Force to phase into the new timeline with his memories mostly intact. Living on \"borrowed time\" due to only possessing a limited amount of Speed Force energy left and forced to use his powers sparingly or accelerate the time of his death, Thawne attempts to acquire a \"Get Out of Hell Free\" card which would allow him to escape his fate, only to be killed when [[Bronze Tiger]] cuts off his fingers so that he would drop the card before [[Deadshot]] shoots him through the head once again. A version of Zoom native to this timeline is mentioned by Deadshot, and mentions they used to know each other, which he comments on the second Thawne's handicap, noting he wasn't nearly as weak before and never needed help from other villains.\n\n===Video games===\n* Professor Zoom appears in various storylines in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''.\n* Professor Zoom is one of the villains in ''[[Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure]]''.
