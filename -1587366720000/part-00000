Nicknamed \"'''Lady Day'''\" by her friend and music partner [[Lester Young]], Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz music and [[pop music|pop]] singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating [[Phrase (music)|phrasing]] and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Review of Lady Day: The Many Faces of Billie Holiday |jstor=931303 |journal=Popular Music |date=January 1, 1993 |pages=201\u2013202 |volume=12 |issue=2 |first=Berndt |last=Ostendorf |doi=10.1017/s0261143000005602}}</ref>\n\nAfter a turbulent childhood, Holiday began singing in nightclubs in [[Harlem]], where she was heard by the producer [[John Hammond (record producer)|John Hammond]], who commended her voice. She signed a recording contract with [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] in 1935. Collaborations with [[Teddy Wilson]] yielded the hit \"[[What a Little Moonlight Can Do]]\", which became a jazz standard. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Holiday had mainstream success on labels such as [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and [[Decca Records|Decca]]. By the late 1940s, however, she was beset with legal troubles and drug abuse. After a short prison sentence, she performed at a sold-out concert at [[Carnegie Hall]], but her reputation deteriorated because of her drug and alcohol problems.\n\nShe was a successful concert performer throughout the 1950s with two further sold-out shows at Carnegie Hall. Due to personal struggles and an altered voice, her final recordings were met with mixed reaction, but were mild commercial successes. Her final album, ''[[Lady in Satin]]'', was released in 1958. Holiday died of [[cirrhosis]] on July 17, 1959.\n\nShe won four [[Grammy Award]]s, all of them posthumously, for Best Historical Album. She was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 1973. ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'', a film about her life, starring [[Diana Ross]], was released in 1972. She is the primary character in the play (later made into a film) ''[[Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill]]''; the role was originated by Reenie Upchurch in 1986, and was played by [[Audra McDonald]] on Broadway and in the film. In 2017 Holiday was inducted into the [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame|National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===1915\u201329: Childhood===\nEleanora Fagan{{sfn|Clarke|2000|p=9}}<ref name=\"bioP1\">{{cite web |last=Howard |first=Patrick |title=About Billie Holiday: Biography |url=http://www.billieholiday.com/about/biography.htm |accessdate=March 13, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226184535/http://www.billieholiday.com/about/biography.htm |archivedate=December 26, 2012 }}</ref> was born on April 7, 1915,<ref>{{cite web |title=Billie Holiday Biography |work=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Billie-Holiday-9341902 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712074554/http://www.biography.com/articles/Billie-Holiday-9341902 |archivedate=July 12, 2009 }}</ref> in Philadelphia, the daughter of unwed teenage couple Sarah Julia \"Sadie\" Fagan and [[Clarence Holiday]].

With no support from her parents, she made arrangements with her older, married half-sister, Eva Miller, for Eleanora to stay with her in Baltimore. Not long after Eleanora was born, Clarence abandoned his family to pursue a career as a jazz banjo player and guitarist.<ref>Dufour, American National Biography Online</ref>\n\n[[File:Billie Holiday 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|Holiday aged 2 in 1917]]\nShe grew up in Baltimore and had a very difficult childhood.  Her mother often took what were then known as \"transportation jobs,\" serving on passenger railroads. Holiday was raised largely by Eva Miller's mother-in-law, Martha Miller, and suffered from her mother's absences and being in others' care for her first decade of life.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 18\u201323.</ref> Holiday's autobiography, ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (book)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'', first published in 1956, is sketchy on details of her early life, but much was confirmed by Stuart Nicholson in his 1995 biography of the singer.\n\nSome historians have disputed Holiday's paternity, as a copy of her birth certificate in the Baltimore archives lists her father as \"Frank DeViese.\" Other historians consider this an anomaly, probably inserted by a hospital or government worker.{{sfn|Clarke|2000|p=xiii}} DeViese lived in Philadelphia, and Sadie Harris may have known him through her work. Sadie Harris, then known as Sadie Fagan, married Philip Gough, but the marriage ended in two years.\n\nEleanora was left with Martha Miller again while her mother took more transportation jobs.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 21\u201322.</ref> She frequently skipped school, and her [[truancy]] resulted in her being brought before the juvenile court on January 5, 1925, when she was nine years old. She was sent to the House of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic [[reform school]], where she was baptized on March 19, 1925. After nine months in care, she was \"paroled\" on October 3, 1925, to her mother. She had opened a restaurant, the East Side Grill, and mother and daughter worked long hours there. She dropped out of school at age 11.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 22\u201324.</ref>\n\nOn December 24, 1926, Sadie came home to discover a neighbor, Wilbur Rich, attempting to rape Eleanora. She successfully fought back, and Rich was arrested. Officials placed Eleanora in the House of the Good Shepherd under protective custody as a state witness in the rape case.<ref>Nicholson, p. 25.</ref> Holiday was released in February 1927, when she was nearly twelve. She found a job running errands in a brothel,<ref>Nicholson, p. 27.</ref> and she scrubbed [[Culture of Baltimore#Marble steps|marble steps]] and kitchen and bathroom floors of neighborhood homes.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Painted Screens of Baltimore: an Urban Folk Art Revealed |last=Eff |first=Elaine |publisher=The University Press of Mississippi |year=2013 |isbn=1617038911 |location= |page=63}}</ref> Around this time, she first heard the records of [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Bessie Smith]]. By the end of 1928, Holiday's mother moved to [[Harlem]], New York, again leaving Eleanora with Martha Miller.<ref>Nicholson, p. 31.</ref>\n\nBy early 1929, Holiday had joined her mother in Harlem. Their landlady was a sharply-dressed woman named Florence Williams, who ran a brothel at 151 West 140th Street. Holiday's mother became a prostitute, and within a matter of days of arriving in New York, Holiday, not yet 14, became a victim of sexual trafficking at $5 a client.<ref name=\"Nicholson, p. 32\">Nicholson, p. 32.</ref> The house was raided on May 2, 1929, and Holiday and her mother were sent to prison. After spending time in a [[workhouse]], her mother was released in July, and Holiday was released in October.\n\n===1929\u201335: Early career===\nAs a young teenager, Holiday started singing in nightclubs in Harlem. She took her professional pseudonym from [[Billie Dove]], an actress she admired, and the musician Clarence Holiday, her probable father.<ref>Holiday, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UVaNDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=%22i+don%27t+think+i+missed+a+single+picture+billie+dove+ever+made%22 p. 13].</ref> At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name \"Halliday,\" her father's birth surname, but eventually changed it to \"Holiday,\" his performing name. The young singer teamed up with a neighbor, [[tenor saxophone]] player Kenneth Hollan. They were a team from 1929 to 1931, performing at clubs such as the Grey Dawn, [[Pod's and Jerry's]] on [[133rd Street]], and the Brooklyn Elks' Club.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 35\u201337.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Vail |first=Ken |title=Lady Day's Diary |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=1997 |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/ladydaysdiarylif00vail/page/32 32] |isbn=1-86074-131-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/ladydaysdiarylif00vail/page/32 }}</ref> [[Benny Goodman]] recalled hearing Holiday in 1931 at the Bright Spot. As her reputation grew, she played in many clubs, including Mexico's and the [[The Harlem Alhambra|Alhambra]] Bar and Grill, where she met Charles Linton, a vocalist who later worked with [[Chick Webb]]. It was also during this period that she connected with her father, who was playing in [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s band.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 35\u201339.</ref>\n\nLate in 1932, 17-year-old Holiday replaced the singer [[Monette Moore]] at Covan's, a club on West 132nd Street. Producer [[John Hammond (producer)|John Hammond]], who loved Moore's singing and had come to hear her, first heard Holiday there in early 1933.<ref>Nicholson, p. 39.</ref> Hammond arranged for Holiday to make her recording debut at age 18, in November 1933, with Benny Goodman. She recorded two songs: \"Your Mother's Son-in-Law\" and \"Riffin' the Scotch,\" the latter being her first hit. \"Son-in-Law\" sold 300 copies, but \"Riffin' the Scotch,\" released on November 11, sold 5,000 copies. Hammond was impressed by Holiday's singing style and said of her, \"Her singing almost changed my music tastes and my musical life, because she was the first girl singer I'd come across who actually sang like an improvising jazz genius.\" Hammond compared Holiday favorably to Armstrong and said she had a good sense of lyric content at her young age.{{sfn|Gourse|2000|p=73}}\n\nIn 1935, Holiday had a small role as a woman abused by her lover in [[Duke Ellington]]'s [[musical short]] film ''[[Symphony in Black|Symphony in Black: A Rhapsody of Negro Life]]''. She sang \"Saddest Tale\" in her scene.<ref>Nicholson, p. 56.</ref>\n\n===1935\u201338: Recordings with Teddy Wilson===\nIn 1935, Holiday was signed to [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] by John Hammond to record pop tunes with pianist [[Teddy Wilson]] in the [[swing music|swing]] style for the growing [[jukebox]] trade. They were allowed to [[Musical improvisation|improvise]] the material. Holiday's improvisation of melody to fit the emotion was revolutionary. Their first collaboration included \"[[What a Little Moonlight Can Do]]\" and \"[[Miss Brown to You]]\". \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" has been deemed her \"claim to fame\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Billie Holiday: Biography & History |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/billie-holiday-mn0000079016/biography |publisher=AllMusic.com |access-date=February 24, 2016}}</ref> Brunswick did not favor the recording session because producers wanted Holiday to sound more like [[Cleo Brown]]. However, after \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" was successful, the company began considering Holiday an artist in her own right.<ref>Nicholson, p. 65.</ref> She began recording under her own name a year later for [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] in sessions produced by Hammond and [[Bernie Hanighen]].<ref>[http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/the_composers.htm Billie Holiday Discography: The Composers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310062032/http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/the_composers.htm |date=March 10, 2011 }}.

Young said, \"I think you can hear that on some of the old records, you know. Some time I'd sit down and listen to 'em myself, and it sound like two of the same voices&nbsp;... or the same mind, or something like that.\"<ref>[http://jazznbossa.ning.com/group/billieholiday Network Offline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521234649/http://jazznbossa.ning.com/group/billieholiday |date=May 21, 2010}}.

According to Hammond, Brunswick was broke and unable to record many jazz tunes. Wilson, Holiday, Young, and other musicians came into the studio without written arrangements, reducing the recording cost. Brunswick paid Holiday a flat fee rather than royalties, which saved the company money. \"[[I Cried for You]]\" sold 15,000 copies, which Hammond called \"a giant hit for Brunswick.... Most records that made money sold around three to four thousand.\"{{sfn|Gourse|2000|pp=73\u201374}}\n\n===1937\u201338: Working for Count Basie and Artie Shaw===\nIn late 1937, Holiday had a brief stint as a big-band vocalist with [[Count Basie]].<ref>[http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/billie%20holiday.html Billie Holiday Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823042136/http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/billie%20holiday.html |date=August 23, 2010}}, Soulwalking.co.uk. Retrieved November 13, 2010.</ref> The traveling conditions of the band were often poor; they performed many one-nighters in clubs, moving from city to city with little stability. Holiday chose the songs she sang and had a hand in the arrangements, choosing to portray her developing persona of a woman unlucky in love. Her tunes included \"I Must Have That Man\", \"Travelin' All Alone\", \"[[I Can't Get Started]]\", and \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\", a hit for Holiday in 1936, originating in [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' the year before. Basie became used to Holiday's heavy involvement in the band. He said, \"When she rehearsed with the band, it was really just a matter of getting her tunes like she wanted them, because she knew how she wanted to sound and you couldn't tell her what to do.\"<ref>Nicholson, pp. 93\u201394.</ref>\n\nHoliday found herself in direct competition with the popular singer [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. The two later became friends.{{sfn|Gourse|2000|p=40}} Fitzgerald was the vocalist for the [[Chick Webb]] Band, which was in competition with the Basie band. On January 16, 1938, the same day that [[Benny Goodman]] performed [[The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert|his legendary Carnegie Hall jazz concert]], the Basie and Webb bands had a battle at the [[Savoy Ballroom]]. Webb and Fitzgerald were declared winners by ''[[Metronome magazine|Metronome]]'' magazine, while ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine pronounced Holiday and Basie the winners. Fitzgerald won a straw poll of the audience by a three-to-one margin.\n\nSome of the songs Holiday performed with Basie were recorded. \"I Can't Get Started\", \"[[They Can't Take That Away from Me]]\", and \"Swing It Brother Swing\" are all commercially available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/live_songs.htm#1937 |title=Billie Holiday Live Songs |publisher=Billieholidaysongs.com |accessdate=April 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423114132/http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/live_songs.htm#1937 |archivedate=April 23, 2010 }}</ref> Holiday was unable to record in the studio with Basie, but she included many of his musicians in her recording sessions with Teddy Wilson.\n\nBy February of that year, Holiday was no longer singing for Basie. Various reasons have been given for her firing. [[Jimmy Rushing]], Basie's male vocalist, called her unprofessional. According to All Music Guide, Holiday was fired for being \"temperamental and unreliable\". She complained of low pay and poor working conditions and may have refused to sing the songs requested of her or change her style.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 96\u201397.</ref>\n\nHoliday was hired by [[Artie Shaw]] a month after being fired from the Count Basie Band. This association placed her among the first black women to work with a white orchestra, an unusual arrangement at that time. This was also the first time a black female singer employed full-time toured the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] U.S. South with a white bandleader. In situations where there was a lot of racial tension, Shaw was known to stick up for his vocalist. In her autobiography, Holiday describes an incident in which she was not permitted to sit on the bandstand with other vocalists because she was black. Shaw said to her, \"I want you on the band stand like [[Helen Forrest]], [[Tony Pastor (bandleader)|Tony Pastor]] and everyone else.\"<ref>Holiday, p. 80.</ref> When touring the South, Holiday would sometimes be heckled by members of the audience. In Louisville, Kentucky, a man called her a \"nigger wench\" and requested she sing another song. Holiday lost her temper and had to be escorted off the stage.{{sfn|Gourse|2000|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nBy March 1938, Shaw and Holiday had been broadcast on New York City's powerful radio station WABC (the original WABC, now [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]]). Because of their success, they were given an extra time slot to broadcast in April, which increased their exposure. The ''[[New York Amsterdam News]]'' reviewed the broadcasts and reported an improvement in Holiday's performance. ''Metronome'' reported that the addition of Holiday to Shaw's band put it in the \"top brackets\". Holiday could not sing as often during Shaw's shows as she could in Basie's; the repertoire was more instrumental, with fewer vocals. Shaw was also pressured to hire a white singer, Nita Bradley, with whom Holiday did not get along but had to share a bandstand. In May 1938, Shaw won band battles against [[Tommy Dorsey]] and [[Red Norvo]] with the audience favoring Holiday. Although Shaw admired Holiday's singing in his band, saying she had a \"remarkable ear\" and a \"remarkable sense of time\", her tenure with the band was nearing an end.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 100\u2013107.</ref>\n\nIn November 1938, Holiday was asked to use the service elevator at the [[Hotel Lincoln (New York City)|Lincoln Hotel]], instead of the passenger elevator, because white patrons of the hotels complained. This may have been the last straw for her. She left the band shortly after. Holiday spoke about the incident weeks later, saying, \"I was never allowed to visit the bar or the dining room as did other members of the band ... [and] I was made to leave and enter through the kitchen.\"\n\nThere are no surviving live recordings of Holiday with Shaw's band. Because she was under contract to a different record label and possibly because of her race, Holiday was able to make only one record with Shaw, \"Any Old Time\". However, Shaw played clarinet on four songs she recorded in New York on July 10, 1936: \"Did I Remember?\", \"No Regrets\", \"Summertime\" and \"[[Billie's Blues]]\".\n\nBy the late 1930s, Holiday had toured with Count Basie and Artie Shaw, scored a string of radio and retail hits with Teddy Wilson, and became an established artist in the recording industry. Her songs \"[[What a Little Moonlight Can Do]]\" and \"[[Easy Living (song)|Easy Living]]\" were imitated by singers across America and were quickly becoming [[jazz standard]]s.<ref>Nicholson, p. 70.</ref> In 1938, Holiday's single \"I'm Gonna Lock My Heart\" ranked sixth as the most-played song in September of that year. Her record label, Vocalion, listed the single as its fourth-best seller for the same month, and it peaked at number 2 on the pop charts, according to Joel Whitburn's ''Pop Memories: 1890\u20131954''.<ref>Nicholson, p. 102.</ref>\n\n===1939: \"Strange Fruit\" and Commodore Records===\nHoliday was recording for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] in the late 1930s when she was introduced to \"[[Strange Fruit]]\", a song based on a poem about [[lynching]] written by [[Abel Meeropol]], a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx. Meeropol used the pseudonym \"Lewis Allan\" for the poem, which was set to music and performed at teachers' union meetings.<ref>Margolick, David (2000). ''Strange Fruit: Billie Holiday, Caf\u00e9 Society, and an Early Cry for Civil Rights''. Philadelphia: Running Press. pp. 25\u201327.</ref> It was eventually heard by Barney Josephson, the proprietor of [[Caf\u00e9 Society]], an integrated nightclub in [[Greenwich Village]], who introduced it to Holiday. She performed it at the club in 1939,<ref>Margolick, ''Strange Fruit'', pp. 40\u201346.</ref> with some trepidation, fearing possible retaliation. She later said that the imagery of the song reminded her of her father's death and that this played a role in her resistance to performing it.\n\nFor her performance of \"Strange Fruit\" at the Caf\u00e9 Society, she had waiters silence the crowd when the song began. During the song's long introduction, the lights dimmed and all movement had to cease. As Holiday began singing, only a small spotlight illuminated her face. On the final note, all lights went out, and when they came back on, Holiday was gone.<ref name=\"Nicholson, p. 113\">Nicholson, p. 113.</ref>\n\nHoliday said her father, Clarence Holiday, was denied medical treatment for a fatal lung disorder because of racial prejudice, and that singing \"Strange Fruit\" reminded her of the incident. \"It reminds me of how Pop died, but I have to keep singing it, not only because people ask for it, but because twenty years after Pop died the things that killed him are still happening in the South\", she wrote in her autobiography.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Lady Sings the Blues'', p. 95.</ref>\n\nWhen Holiday's producers at Columbia found the subject matter too sensitive, [[Milt Gabler]] agreed to record it for his [[Commodore Records]] label on April 20, 1939. \"Strange Fruit\" remained in her repertoire for twenty years. She recorded it again for [[Verve Records|Verve]]. The Commodore release did not get any airplay, but the controversial song sold well, though Gabler attributed that mostly to the record's other side, \"[[Fine and Mellow]]\", which was a [[jukebox]] hit.{{sfn|Clarke|2000|p=169}} \"The version I recorded for Commodore\", Holiday said of \"Strange Fruit\", \"became my biggest-selling record.\"<ref>Holiday, Billie (2006).

Originally published by Doubleday, New York, 1956. p. 95.</ref> \"Strange Fruit\" was the equivalent of a top-twenty hit in the 1930s.\n\nHoliday's popularity increased after \"Strange Fruit\". She received a mention in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine.<ref>Nicholson, p. 115.</ref> \"I open Caf\u00e9 Society as an unknown,\" Holiday said. \"I left two years later as a star. I needed the prestige and publicity all right, but you can't pay rent with it.\" She soon demanded a raise from her manager, [[Joe Glaser]].<ref>''Lady Sings the Blues'', pp. 104\u2013105.</ref>\n\nHoliday returned to Commodore in 1944, recording songs she made with Teddy Wilson in the 1930s, including \"[[I Cover the Waterfront (song)|I Cover the Waterfront]]\", \"[[I'll Get By (As Long as I Have You)|I'll Get By]]\", and \"He's Funny That Way\". She also recorded new songs that were popular at the time, including, \"My Old Flame\", \"How Am I to Know?\", \"I'm Yours\", and \"[[I'll Be Seeing You (song)|I'll Be Seeing You]]\", a number one hit for [[Bing Crosby]]. She also recorded her version of \"[[Embraceable You]]\", which was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2005.\n\n===1940\u201347: Commercial success===\n[[File:(Portrait of Billie Holiday and Mister, Downbeat, New York, N.Y., ca.

She used money from her daughter while playing dice with members of the Count Basie band, with whom she toured in the late 1930s. \"It kept Mom busy and happy and stopped her from worrying and watching over me\", Holiday said. Fagan began borrowing large amounts from Holiday to support the restaurant. Holiday obliged but soon fell on hard times herself. \"I needed some money one night and I knew Mom was sure to have some\", she said. \"So I walked in the restaurant like a stockholder and asked. Mom turned me down flat. She wouldn't give me a cent.\" The two argued, and Holiday shouted angrily, \"God bless the child that's got his own\", and stormed out. With [[Arthur Herzog, Jr.]], a pianist, she wrote a song based on the lyric, \"[[God Bless the Child (Billie Holiday song)|God Bless the Child]]\", and added music.<ref>''Lady Sings the Blues'', pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\n\"God Bless the Child\" became Holiday's most popular and most covered record.

Holiday hesitated, unsure audiences would accept her after the arrest. She gave in and agreed to appear.\n\nOn March 27, 1948, Holiday played Carnegie Hall to a sold-out crowd. 2,700 tickets were sold in advance, a record at the time for the venue. Her popularity was unusual because she didn't have a current hit record.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 165\u2013167.</ref> Her last record to reach the charts was \"Lover Man\" in 1945. Holiday sang 32 songs at the Carnegie concert by her count, including [[Cole Porter]]'s \"[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]\" and her 1930s hit, \"[[Strange Fruit]]\". During the show, someone sent her a box of gardenias. \"My old trademark,\" Holiday said. \"I took them out of box and fastened them smack to the side of my head without even looking twice.\" There was a hatpin in the gardenias and Holiday unknowingly stuck it into the side of her head. \"I didn't feel anything until the blood started rushing down in my eyes and ears,\" she said.

She married trombonist Jimmy Monroe on August 25, 1941. While still married, she became involved with trumpeter Joe Guy, her drug dealer. She divorced Monroe in 1947 and also split with Guy.\n\nIn October 1949, Holiday recorded \"[[Crazy He Calls Me]]\", which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2010. Gabler said the hit was her most successful recording for Decca after \"Lover Man\". The charts of the 1940s did not list songs outside the top 30, making it impossible to recognize minor hits. By the late 1940s, despite her popularity and concert power, her singles were little played on radio, perhaps because of her reputation.{{sfn|Clarke|2000|p=327}}\n\nHoliday's [[New York City Cabaret Card]] was revoked because of her 1947 conviction, preventing her working anywhere that sold alcohol for the remaining 12 years of her life.\n\nThe cabaret system started in 1940 and was intended to prevent people of \"bad character\" from working on licensed premises. A performer had to renew the license every two years. The system lasted until 1967.{{sfn|Rosenstein|2018|p=134}} Clubs that sold alcohol in New York were among the highest-paying in the country. Club owners knew [[blacklisting|blacklisted]] performers had limited work and could offer a smaller salary. This reduced Holiday's earnings. She had not received proper record royalties until she joined Decca, so her main revenue was club concerts. The problem worsened when Holiday's records went out of print in the 1950s. She seldom received royalties in her later years. In 1958 she received a royalty of only $11.<ref>Nicholson, p. 229.</ref><ref>Nicholson, p. 167.</ref> Her lawyer in the late 1950s, Earle Warren Zaidins, registered with BMI only two songs she had written or co-written, costing her revenue.<ref>Nicholson, p. 215.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, Holiday played at the Ebony Club, which, because she lost her cabaret card, was against the law. Her manager, John Levy, was convinced he could get her card back and allowed her to open without one. \"I opened scared,\" Holiday said, \"[I was] expecting the cops to come in any chorus and carry me off. But nothing happened. I was a huge success.\"<ref>Autobiography \"Lady Sings the Blues\" p. 175.</ref>\n\nHoliday recorded Gershwin's \"[[I Loves You, Porgy]]\" in 1948.\n\nIn 1950, Holiday appeared in the [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] short film ''[[Sugar Chile Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet]]'', singing \"God Bless the Child\" and \"Now, Baby or Never\".<ref>Nicholson, p. 181.</ref>\n\n===1952\u201359: ''Lady Sings the Blues''===\nBy the 1950s, Holiday's drug abuse, drinking, and relationships with abusive men caused her health to deteriorate. She appeared on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[reality television|reality series]] ''[[The Comeback Story]]'' to discuss attempts to overcome her misfortunes. Her later recordings showed the effects of declining health on her voice, as it grew coarse and no longer projected its former vibrancy{{dubious|date=August 2019}}.\n\nHoliday first toured Europe in 1954 as part of a [[Leonard Feather]] package. The [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[impresario]], [[Nils Hellstrom]], initiated the \"Jazz Club U.S.A.\" (after the Leonard Feather radio show) tour starting in [[Stockholm]] in January 1954 and then Germany, Netherlands, Paris and Switzerland. The tour party was Holiday, [[Buddy DeFranco]], [[Red Norvo]], [[Carl Drinkard]], [[Elaine Leighton]], [[Sonny Clark]], [[Berryl Booker]], [[Jimmy Raney]], and [[Red Mitchell]]. A recording of a live set in Germany was released as ''Lady Love \u2013 Billie Holiday''.<ref>Record notes, ''Lady Love \u2013 Billie Holiday'', [[United Artists Records]], UAL 8073; notes by [[Leonard Feather]] and [[LeRoi Jones]].</ref>\n\nHoliday's late recordings for Verve constitute about a third of her commercially issued output and are as popular as her earlier records for Columbia, Commodore and Decca. In later years, her voice became more fragile, but it never lost the edge that had always made it distinctive.\n\nHoliday's autobiography, ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (book)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'', was ghostwritten by [[William Dufty]] and published in 1956. Dufty, a ''[[New York Post]]'' writer and editor then married to Holiday's close friend Maely Dufty, wrote the book quickly from a series of conversations with the singer in the Duftys' 93rd Street apartment. He also drew on the work of earlier interviewers and intended to let Holiday tell her story in her own way.<ref name=\"Chronicle\" />\n\nIn his 2015 study, ''Billie Holiday: The Musician and the Myth'', [[John Szwed]] argued that ''Lady Sings the Blues'' is a generally accurate account of her life, and that co-writer Dufty was forced to water down or suppress material by the threat of legal action. According to the reviewer [[Richard Brody]], \"Szwed traces the stories of two important relationships that are missing from the book\u2014with [[Charles Laughton]], in the 1930s, and with [[Tallulah Bankhead]], in the late 1940s\u2014and of one relationship that's sharply diminished in the book, her affair with [[Orson Welles]] around the time of ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.\"<ref name=NY>{{cite news|author=Brody, Richard|authorlink=Richard Brody|title=The Art of Billie Holiday's Life |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-art-of-billie-holidays-life |accessdate=April 6, 2015|work=The New Yorker|date=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo accompany her autobiography, Holiday released the LP ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (Billie Holiday album)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'' in June 1956.

Interspersed among Holiday's songs, Millstein read aloud four lengthy passages from her autobiography, ''Lady Sings the Blues''. He later wrote:\n\n{{quote|The narration began with the ironic account of her birth in Baltimore \u2013 'Mom and Pop were just a couple of kids when they got married. He was eighteen, she was sixteen, and I was three' \u2013 and ended, very nearly shyly, with her hope for love and a long life with 'my man' at her side. It was evident, even then, that Miss Holiday was ill. I had known her casually over the years and I was shocked at her physical weakness. Her rehearsal had been desultory; her voice sounded tinny and trailed off; her body sagged tiredly. But I will not forget the metamorphosis that night. The lights went down, the musicians began to play and the narration began. Miss Holiday stepped from between the curtains, into the white spotlight awaiting her, wearing a white evening gown and white gardenias in her black hair. She was erect and beautiful; poised and smiling. And when the first section of narration was ended, she sang \u2013 with strength undiminished \u2013 with all of the art that was hers. I was very much moved. In the darkness, my face burned and my eyes. I recall only one thing. I smiled.\"<ref name=Millstein />}}\n\nThe critic [[Nat Hentoff]] of ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine, who attended the Carnegie Hall concert, wrote the remainder of the sleeve notes on the 1961 album. He wrote of Holiday's performance:\n\n{{quote|Throughout the night, Billie was in superior form to what had sometimes been the case in the last years of her life. Not only was there assurance of phrasing and intonation; but there was also an outgoing warmth, a palpable eagerness to reach and touch the audience. And there was mocking wit. A smile was often lightly evident on her lips and her eyes as if, for once, she could accept the fact that there were people who did dig her. The beat flowed in her uniquely sinuous, supple way of moving the story along; the words became her own experiences; and coursing through it all was Lady's sound \u2013 a texture simultaneously steel-edged and yet soft inside; a voice that was almost unbearably wise in disillusion and yet still childlike, again at the centre. The audience was hers from before she sang, greeting her and saying good-bye with heavy, loving applause. And at one time, the musicians too applauded. It was a night when Billie was on top, undeniably the best and most honest jazz singer alive.}}\n\nHer performance of \"Fine and Mellow\" on [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Sound of Jazz]]'' program is memorable for her interplay with her long-time friend [[Lester Young]]. Both were less than two years from death. Young died in March 1959. Holiday wanted to sing at his funeral, but her request was denied.\n\nWhen Holiday returned to Europe almost five years later, in 1959, she made one of her last television appearances for Granada's ''Chelsea at Nine'' in London. Her final studio recordings were made for [[MGM Records]] in 1959, with lush backing from [[Ray Ellis]] and his Orchestra, who had also accompanied her on the Columbia album ''[[Lady in Satin]]'' the previous year (see below). The MGM sessions were released posthumously on a self-titled album, later retitled and re-released as ''[[Last Recording]]''.\n\nOn March 28, 1957, Holiday married Louis McKay, a [[Mafia]] enforcer.

Nicknamed \"'''Lady Day'''\" by her friend and music partner [[Lester Young]], Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz music and [[pop music|pop]] singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating [[Phrase (music)|phrasing]] and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Review of Lady Day: The Many Faces of Billie Holiday |jstor=931303 |journal=Popular Music |date=January 1, 1993 |pages=201\u2013202 |volume=12 |issue=2 |first=Berndt |last=Ostendorf |doi=10.1017/s0261143000005602}}</ref>\n\nAfter a turbulent childhood, Holiday began singing in nightclubs in [[Harlem]], where she was heard by the producer [[John Hammond (record producer)|John Hammond]], who commended her voice. She signed a recording contract with [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] in 1935. Collaborations with [[Teddy Wilson]] yielded the hit \"[[What a Little Moonlight Can Do]]\", which became a jazz standard. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Holiday had mainstream success on labels such as [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and [[Decca Records|Decca]]. By the late 1940s, however, she was beset with legal troubles and drug abuse. After a short prison sentence, she performed at a sold-out concert at [[Carnegie Hall]], but her reputation deteriorated because of her drug and alcohol problems.\n\nShe was a successful concert performer throughout the 1950s with two further sold-out shows at Carnegie Hall. Due to personal struggles and an altered voice, her final recordings were met with mixed reaction, but were mild commercial successes. Her final album, ''[[Lady in Satin]]'', was released in 1958. Holiday died of [[cirrhosis]] on July 17, 1959.\n\nShe won four [[Grammy Award]]s, all of them posthumously, for Best Historical Album. She was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 1973. ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'', a film about her life, starring [[Diana Ross]], was released in 1972. She is the primary character in the play (later made into a film) ''[[Lady Day at Emerson's Bar and Grill]]''; the role was originated by Reenie Upchurch in 1986, and was played by [[Audra McDonald]] on Broadway and in the film. In 2017 Holiday was inducted into the [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame|National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===1915\u201329: Childhood===\nEleanora Fagan{{sfn|Clarke|2000|p=9}}<ref name=\"bioP1\">{{cite web |last=Howard |first=Patrick |title=About Billie Holiday: Biography |url=http://www.billieholiday.com/about/biography.htm |accessdate=March 13, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226184535/http://www.billieholiday.com/about/biography.htm |archivedate=December 26, 2012 }}</ref> was born on April 7, 1915,<ref>{{cite web |title=Billie Holiday Biography |work=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Billie-Holiday-9341902 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712074554/http://www.biography.com/articles/Billie-Holiday-9341902 |archivedate=July 12, 2009 }}</ref> in Philadelphia, the daughter of unwed teenage couple Sarah Julia \"Sadie\" Fagan and [[Clarence Holiday]].

With no support from her parents, she made arrangements with her older, married half-sister, Eva Miller, for Eleanora to stay with her in Baltimore. Not long after Eleanora was born, Clarence abandoned his family to pursue a career as a jazz banjo player and guitarist.<ref>Dufour, American National Biography Online</ref>\n\n[[File:Billie Holiday 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|Holiday aged 2 in 1917]]\nShe grew up in Baltimore and had a very difficult childhood.  Her mother often took what were then known as \"transportation jobs,\" serving on passenger railroads. Holiday was raised largely by Eva Miller's mother-in-law, Martha Miller, and suffered from her mother's absences and being in others' care for her first decade of life.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 18\u201323.</ref> Holiday's autobiography, ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (book)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'', first published in 1956, is sketchy on details of her early life, but much was confirmed by Stuart Nicholson in his 1995 biography of the singer.\n\nSome historians have disputed Holiday's paternity, as a copy of her birth certificate in the Baltimore archives lists her father as \"Frank DeViese.\" Other historians consider this an anomaly, probably inserted by a hospital or government worker.{{sfn|Clarke|2000|p=xiii}} DeViese lived in Philadelphia, and Sadie Harris may have known him through her work. Sadie Harris, then known as Sadie Fagan, married Philip Gough, but the marriage ended in two years.\n\nEleanora was left with Martha Miller again while her mother took more transportation jobs.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 21\u201322.</ref> She frequently skipped school, and her [[truancy]] resulted in her being brought before the juvenile court on January 5, 1925, when she was nine years old. She was sent to the House of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic [[reform school]], where she was baptized on March 19, 1925. After nine months in care, she was \"paroled\" on October 3, 1925, to her mother. She had opened a restaurant, the East Side Grill, and mother and daughter worked long hours there. She dropped out of school at age 11.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 22\u201324.</ref>\n\nOn December 24, 1926, Sadie came home to discover a neighbor, Wilbur Rich, attempting to rape Eleanora. She successfully fought back, and Rich was arrested. Officials placed Eleanora in the House of the Good Shepherd under protective custody as a state witness in the rape case.<ref>Nicholson, p. 25.</ref> Holiday was released in February 1927, when she was nearly twelve. She found a job running errands in a brothel,<ref>Nicholson, p. 27.</ref> and she scrubbed [[Culture of Baltimore#Marble steps|marble steps]] and kitchen and bathroom floors of neighborhood homes.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Painted Screens of Baltimore: an Urban Folk Art Revealed |last=Eff |first=Elaine |publisher=The University Press of Mississippi |year=2013 |isbn=1617038911 |location= |page=63}}</ref> Around this time, she first heard the records of [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Bessie Smith]]. By the end of 1928, Holiday's mother moved to [[Harlem]], New York, again leaving Eleanora with Martha Miller.<ref>Nicholson, p. 31.</ref>\n\nBy early 1929, Holiday had joined her mother in Harlem. Their landlady was a sharply-dressed woman named Florence Williams, who ran a brothel at 151 West 140th Street. Holiday's mother became a prostitute, and within a matter of days of arriving in New York, Holiday, not yet 14, became a victim of sexual trafficking at $5 a client.<ref name=\"Nicholson, p. 32\">Nicholson, p. 32.</ref> The house was raided on May 2, 1929, and Holiday and her mother were sent to prison. After spending time in a [[workhouse]], her mother was released in July, and Holiday was released in October.\n\n===1929\u201335: Early career===\nAs a young teenager, Holiday started singing in nightclubs in Harlem. She took her professional pseudonym from [[Billie Dove]], an actress she admired, and the musician Clarence Holiday, her probable father.<ref>Holiday, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UVaNDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA13&dq=%22i+don%27t+think+i+missed+a+single+picture+billie+dove+ever+made%22 p. 13].</ref> At the outset of her career, she spelled her last name \"Halliday,\" her father's birth surname, but eventually changed it to \"Holiday,\" his performing name. The young singer teamed up with a neighbor, [[tenor saxophone]] player Kenneth Hollan. They were a team from 1929 to 1931, performing at clubs such as the Grey Dawn, [[Pod's and Jerry's]] on [[133rd Street]], and the Brooklyn Elks' Club.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 35\u201337.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Vail |first=Ken |title=Lady Day's Diary |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=1997 |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/ladydaysdiarylif00vail/page/32 32] |isbn=1-86074-131-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/ladydaysdiarylif00vail/page/32 }}</ref> [[Benny Goodman]] recalled hearing Holiday in 1931 at the Bright Spot. As her reputation grew, she played in many clubs, including Mexico's and the [[The Harlem Alhambra|Alhambra]] Bar and Grill, where she met Charles Linton, a vocalist who later worked with [[Chick Webb]]. It was also during this period that she connected with her father, who was playing in [[Fletcher Henderson]]'s band.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 35\u201339.</ref>\n\nLate in 1932, 17-year-old Holiday replaced the singer [[Monette Moore]] at Covan's, a club on West 132nd Street. Producer [[John Hammond (producer)|John Hammond]], who loved Moore's singing and had come to hear her, first heard Holiday there in early 1933.<ref>Nicholson, p. 39.</ref> Hammond arranged for Holiday to make her recording debut at age 18, in November 1933, with Benny Goodman. She recorded two songs: \"Your Mother's Son-in-Law\" and \"Riffin' the Scotch,\" the latter being her first hit. \"Son-in-Law\" sold 300 copies, but \"Riffin' the Scotch,\" released on November 11, sold 5,000 copies. Hammond was impressed by Holiday's singing style and said of her, \"Her singing almost changed my music tastes and my musical life, because she was the first girl singer I'd come across who actually sang like an improvising jazz genius.\" Hammond compared Holiday favorably to Armstrong and said she had a good sense of lyric content at her young age.{{sfn|Gourse|2000|p=73}}\n\nIn 1935, Holiday had a small role as a woman abused by her lover in [[Duke Ellington]]'s [[musical short]] film ''[[Symphony in Black|Symphony in Black: A Rhapsody of Negro Life]]''. She sang \"Saddest Tale\" in her scene.<ref>Nicholson, p. 56.</ref>\n\n===1935\u201338: Recordings with Teddy Wilson===\nIn 1935, Holiday was signed to [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] by John Hammond to record pop tunes with pianist [[Teddy Wilson]] in the [[swing music|swing]] style for the growing [[jukebox]] trade. They were allowed to [[Musical improvisation|improvise]] the material. Holiday's improvisation of melody to fit the emotion was revolutionary. Their first collaboration included \"[[What a Little Moonlight Can Do]]\" and \"[[Miss Brown to You]]\". \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" has been deemed her \"claim to fame\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Billie Holiday: Biography & History |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/billie-holiday-mn0000079016/biography |publisher=AllMusic.com |access-date=February 24, 2016}}</ref> Brunswick did not favor the recording session because producers wanted Holiday to sound more like [[Cleo Brown]]. However, after \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" was successful, the company began considering Holiday an artist in her own right.<ref>Nicholson, p. 65.</ref> She began recording under her own name a year later for [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]] in sessions produced by Hammond and [[Bernie Hanighen]].<ref>[http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/the_composers.htm Billie Holiday Discography: The Composers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310062032/http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/the_composers.htm |date=March 10, 2011 }}.

Young said, \"I think you can hear that on some of the old records, you know. Some time I'd sit down and listen to 'em myself, and it sound like two of the same voices&nbsp;... or the same mind, or something like that.\"<ref>[http://jazznbossa.ning.com/group/billieholiday Network Offline] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521234649/http://jazznbossa.ning.com/group/billieholiday |date=May 21, 2010}}.

According to Hammond, Brunswick was broke and unable to record many jazz tunes. Wilson, Holiday, Young, and other musicians came into the studio without written arrangements, reducing the recording cost. Brunswick paid Holiday a flat fee rather than royalties, which saved the company money. \"[[I Cried for You]]\" sold 15,000 copies, which Hammond called \"a giant hit for Brunswick.... Most records that made money sold around three to four thousand.\"{{sfn|Gourse|2000|pp=73\u201374}}\n\n===1937\u201338: Working for Count Basie and Artie Shaw===\nIn late 1937, Holiday had a brief stint as a big-band vocalist with [[Count Basie]].<ref>[http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/billie%20holiday.html Billie Holiday Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823042136/http://www.soulwalking.co.uk/billie%20holiday.html |date=August 23, 2010}}, Soulwalking.co.uk. Retrieved November 13, 2010.</ref> The traveling conditions of the band were often poor; they performed many one-nighters in clubs, moving from city to city with little stability. Holiday chose the songs she sang and had a hand in the arrangements, choosing to portray her developing persona of a woman unlucky in love. Her tunes included \"I Must Have That Man\", \"Travelin' All Alone\", \"[[I Can't Get Started]]\", and \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\", a hit for Holiday in 1936, originating in [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' the year before. Basie became used to Holiday's heavy involvement in the band. He said, \"When she rehearsed with the band, it was really just a matter of getting her tunes like she wanted them, because she knew how she wanted to sound and you couldn't tell her what to do.\"<ref>Nicholson, pp. 93\u201394.</ref>\n\nHoliday found herself in direct competition with the popular singer [[Ella Fitzgerald]]. The two later became friends.{{sfn|Gourse|2000|p=40}} Fitzgerald was the vocalist for the [[Chick Webb]] Band, which was in competition with the Basie band. On January 16, 1938, the same day that [[Benny Goodman]] performed [[The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert|his legendary Carnegie Hall jazz concert]], the Basie and Webb bands had a battle at the [[Savoy Ballroom]]. Webb and Fitzgerald were declared winners by ''[[Metronome magazine|Metronome]]'' magazine, while ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine pronounced Holiday and Basie the winners. Fitzgerald won a straw poll of the audience by a three-to-one margin.\n\nSome of the songs Holiday performed with Basie were recorded. \"I Can't Get Started\", \"[[They Can't Take That Away from Me]]\", and \"Swing It Brother Swing\" are all commercially available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/live_songs.htm#1937 |title=Billie Holiday Live Songs |publisher=Billieholidaysongs.com |accessdate=April 7, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423114132/http://www.billieholidaysongs.com/live_songs.htm#1937 |archivedate=April 23, 2010 }}</ref> Holiday was unable to record in the studio with Basie, but she included many of his musicians in her recording sessions with Teddy Wilson.\n\nBy February of that year, Holiday was no longer singing for Basie. Various reasons have been given for her firing. [[Jimmy Rushing]], Basie's male vocalist, called her unprofessional. According to All Music Guide, Holiday was fired for being \"temperamental and unreliable\". She complained of low pay and poor working conditions and may have refused to sing the songs requested of her or change her style.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 96\u201397.</ref>\n\nHoliday was hired by [[Artie Shaw]] a month after being fired from the Count Basie Band. This association placed her among the first black women to work with a white orchestra, an unusual arrangement at that time. This was also the first time a black female singer employed full-time toured the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] U.S. South with a white bandleader. In situations where there was a lot of racial tension, Shaw was known to stick up for his vocalist. In her autobiography, Holiday describes an incident in which she was not permitted to sit on the bandstand with other vocalists because she was black. Shaw said to her, \"I want you on the band stand like [[Helen Forrest]], [[Tony Pastor (bandleader)|Tony Pastor]] and everyone else.\"<ref>Holiday, p. 80.</ref> When touring the South, Holiday would sometimes be heckled by members of the audience. In Louisville, Kentucky, a man called her a \"nigger wench\" and requested she sing another song. Holiday lost her temper and had to be escorted off the stage.{{sfn|Gourse|2000|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nBy March 1938, Shaw and Holiday had been broadcast on New York City's powerful radio station WABC (the original WABC, now [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]]). Because of their success, they were given an extra time slot to broadcast in April, which increased their exposure. The ''[[New York Amsterdam News]]'' reviewed the broadcasts and reported an improvement in Holiday's performance. ''Metronome'' reported that the addition of Holiday to Shaw's band put it in the \"top brackets\". Holiday could not sing as often during Shaw's shows as she could in Basie's; the repertoire was more instrumental, with fewer vocals. Shaw was also pressured to hire a white singer, Nita Bradley, with whom Holiday did not get along but had to share a bandstand. In May 1938, Shaw won band battles against [[Tommy Dorsey]] and [[Red Norvo]] with the audience favoring Holiday. Although Shaw admired Holiday's singing in his band, saying she had a \"remarkable ear\" and a \"remarkable sense of time\", her tenure with the band was nearing an end.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 100\u2013107.</ref>\n\nIn November 1938, Holiday was asked to use the service elevator at the [[Hotel Lincoln (New York City)|Lincoln Hotel]], instead of the passenger elevator, because white patrons of the hotels complained. This may have been the last straw for her. She left the band shortly after. Holiday spoke about the incident weeks later, saying, \"I was never allowed to visit the bar or the dining room as did other members of the band ... [and] I was made to leave and enter through the kitchen.\"\n\nThere are no surviving live recordings of Holiday with Shaw's band. Because she was under contract to a different record label and possibly because of her race, Holiday was able to make only one record with Shaw, \"Any Old Time\". However, Shaw played clarinet on four songs she recorded in New York on July 10, 1936: \"Did I Remember?\", \"No Regrets\", \"Summertime\" and \"[[Billie's Blues]]\".\n\nBy the late 1930s, Holiday had toured with Count Basie and Artie Shaw, scored a string of radio and retail hits with Teddy Wilson, and became an established artist in the recording industry. Her songs \"[[What a Little Moonlight Can Do]]\" and \"[[Easy Living (song)|Easy Living]]\" were imitated by singers across America and were quickly becoming [[jazz standard]]s.<ref>Nicholson, p. 70.</ref> In 1938, Holiday's single \"I'm Gonna Lock My Heart\" ranked sixth as the most-played song in September of that year. Her record label, Vocalion, listed the single as its fourth-best seller for the same month, and it peaked at number 2 on the pop charts, according to Joel Whitburn's ''Pop Memories: 1890\u20131954''.<ref>Nicholson, p. 102.</ref>\n\n===1939: \"Strange Fruit\" and Commodore Records===\nHoliday was recording for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] in the late 1930s when she was introduced to \"[[Strange Fruit]]\", a song based on a poem about [[lynching]] written by [[Abel Meeropol]], a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx. Meeropol used the pseudonym \"Lewis Allan\" for the poem, which was set to music and performed at teachers' union meetings.<ref>Margolick, David (2000). ''Strange Fruit: Billie Holiday, Caf\u00e9 Society, and an Early Cry for Civil Rights''. Philadelphia: Running Press. pp. 25\u201327.</ref> It was eventually heard by Barney Josephson, the proprietor of [[Caf\u00e9 Society]], an integrated nightclub in [[Greenwich Village]], who introduced it to Holiday. She performed it at the club in 1939,<ref>Margolick, ''Strange Fruit'', pp. 40\u201346.</ref> with some trepidation, fearing possible retaliation. She later said that the imagery of the song reminded her of her father's death and that this played a role in her resistance to performing it.\n\nFor her performance of \"Strange Fruit\" at the Caf\u00e9 Society, she had waiters silence the crowd when the song began. During the song's long introduction, the lights dimmed and all movement had to cease. As Holiday began singing, only a small spotlight illuminated her face. On the final note, all lights went out, and when they came back on, Holiday was gone.<ref name=\"Nicholson, p. 113\">Nicholson, p. 113.</ref>\n\nHoliday said her father, Clarence Holiday, was denied medical treatment for a fatal lung disorder because of racial prejudice, and that singing \"Strange Fruit\" reminded her of the incident. \"It reminds me of how Pop died, but I have to keep singing it, not only because people ask for it, but because twenty years after Pop died the things that killed him are still happening in the South\", she wrote in her autobiography.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Lady Sings the Blues'', p. 95.</ref>\n\nWhen Holiday's producers at Columbia found the subject matter too sensitive, [[Milt Gabler]] agreed to record it for his [[Commodore Records]] label on April 20, 1939. \"Strange Fruit\" remained in her repertoire for twenty years. She recorded it again for [[Verve Records|Verve]]. The Commodore release did not get any airplay, but the controversial song sold well, though Gabler attributed that mostly to the record's other side, \"[[Fine and Mellow]]\", which was a [[jukebox]] hit.{{sfn|Clarke|2000|p=169}} \"The version I recorded for Commodore\", Holiday said of \"Strange Fruit\", \"became my biggest-selling record.\"<ref>Holiday, Billie (2006).

Originally published by Doubleday, New York, 1956. p. 95.</ref> \"Strange Fruit\" was the equivalent of a top-twenty hit in the 1930s.\n\nHoliday's popularity increased after \"Strange Fruit\". She received a mention in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine.<ref>Nicholson, p. 115.</ref> \"I open Caf\u00e9 Society as an unknown,\" Holiday said. \"I left two years later as a star. I needed the prestige and publicity all right, but you can't pay rent with it.\" She soon demanded a raise from her manager, [[Joe Glaser]].<ref>''Lady Sings the Blues'', pp. 104\u2013105.</ref>\n\nHoliday returned to Commodore in 1944, recording songs she made with Teddy Wilson in the 1930s, including \"[[I Cover the Waterfront (song)|I Cover the Waterfront]]\", \"[[I'll Get By (As Long as I Have You)|I'll Get By]]\", and \"He's Funny That Way\". She also recorded new songs that were popular at the time, including, \"My Old Flame\", \"How Am I to Know?\", \"I'm Yours\", and \"[[I'll Be Seeing You (song)|I'll Be Seeing You]]\", a number one hit for [[Bing Crosby]]. She also recorded her version of \"[[Embraceable You]]\", which was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2005.\n\n===1940\u201347: Commercial success===\n[[File:(Portrait of Billie Holiday and Mister, Downbeat, New York, N.Y., ca.

Fagan began borrowing large amounts from Holiday to support the restaurant.

Her popularity was unusual because she didn't have a current hit record.<ref>Nicholson, pp. 165\u2013167.</ref> Her last record to reach the charts was \"Lover Man\" in 1945. Holiday sang 32 songs at the Carnegie concert by her count, including [[Cole Porter]]'s \"[[Night and Day (song)|Night and Day]]\" and her 1930s hit, \"[[Strange Fruit]]\". During the show, someone sent her a box of gardenias. \"My old trademark,\" Holiday said. \"I took them out of box and fastened them smack to the side of my head without even looking twice.\" There was a hatpin in the gardenias and Holiday unknowingly stuck it into the side of her head. \"I didn't feel anything until the blood started rushing down in my eyes and ears,\" she said.

She married trombonist Jimmy Monroe on August 25, 1941. While still married, she became involved with trumpeter Joe Guy, her drug dealer. She divorced Monroe in 1947 and also split with Guy.\n\nIn October 1949, Holiday recorded \"[[Crazy He Calls Me]]\", which was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2010. Gabler said the hit was her most successful recording for Decca after \"Lover Man\". The charts of the 1940s did not list songs outside the top 30, making it impossible to recognize minor hits. By the late 1940s, despite her popularity and concert power, her singles were little played on radio, perhaps because of her reputation.{{sfn|Clarke|2000|p=327}}\n\nHoliday's [[New York City Cabaret Card]] was revoked because of her 1947 conviction, preventing her working anywhere that sold alcohol for the remaining 12 years of her life.\n\nThe cabaret system started in 1940 and was intended to prevent people of \"bad character\" from working on licensed premises. A performer had to renew the license every two years. The system lasted until 1967.{{sfn|Rosenstein|2018|p=134}} Clubs that sold alcohol in New York were among the highest-paying in the country. Club owners knew [[blacklisting|blacklisted]] performers had limited work and could offer a smaller salary. This reduced Holiday's earnings. She had not received proper record royalties until she joined Decca, so her main revenue was club concerts. The problem worsened when Holiday's records went out of print in the 1950s. She seldom received royalties in her later years. In 1958 she received a royalty of only $11.<ref>Nicholson, p. 229.</ref><ref>Nicholson, p. 167.</ref> Her lawyer in the late 1950s, Earle Warren Zaidins, registered with BMI only two songs she had written or co-written, costing her revenue.<ref>Nicholson, p. 215.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, Holiday played at the Ebony Club, which, because she lost her cabaret card, was against the law. Her manager, John Levy, was convinced he could get her card back and allowed her to open without one. \"I opened scared,\" Holiday said, \"[I was] expecting the cops to come in any chorus and carry me off.

I was a huge success.\"<ref>Autobiography \"Lady Sings the Blues\" p. 175.</ref>\n\nHoliday recorded Gershwin's \"[[I Loves You, Porgy]]\" in 1948.\n\nIn 1950, Holiday appeared in the [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] short film ''[[Sugar Chile Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet]]'', singing \"God Bless the Child\" and \"Now, Baby or Never\".<ref>Nicholson, p. 181.</ref>\n\n===1952\u201359: ''Lady Sings the Blues''===\nBy the 1950s, Holiday's drug abuse, drinking, and relationships with abusive men caused her health to deteriorate. She appeared on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[reality television|reality series]] ''[[The Comeback Story]]'' to discuss attempts to overcome her misfortunes. Her later recordings showed the effects of declining health on her voice, as it grew coarse and no longer projected its former vibrancy{{dubious|date=August 2019}}.\n\nHoliday first toured Europe in 1954 as part of a [[Leonard Feather]] package. The [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[impresario]], [[Nils Hellstrom]], initiated the \"Jazz Club U.S.A.\" (after the Leonard Feather radio show) tour starting in [[Stockholm]] in January 1954 and then Germany, Netherlands, Paris and Switzerland. The tour party was Holiday, [[Buddy DeFranco]], [[Red Norvo]], [[Carl Drinkard]], [[Elaine Leighton]], [[Sonny Clark]], [[Berryl Booker]], [[Jimmy Raney]], and [[Red Mitchell]]. A recording of a live set in Germany was released as ''Lady Love \u2013 Billie Holiday''.<ref>Record notes, ''Lady Love \u2013 Billie Holiday'', [[United Artists Records]], UAL 8073; notes by [[Leonard Feather]] and [[LeRoi Jones]].</ref>\n\nHoliday's late recordings for Verve constitute about a third of her commercially issued output and are as popular as her earlier records for Columbia, Commodore and Decca. In later years, her voice became more fragile, but it never lost the edge that had always made it distinctive.\n\nHoliday's autobiography, ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (book)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'', was ghostwritten by [[William Dufty]] and published in 1956. Dufty, a ''[[New York Post]]'' writer and editor then married to Holiday's close friend Maely Dufty, wrote the book quickly from a series of conversations with the singer in the Duftys' 93rd Street apartment. He also drew on the work of earlier interviewers and intended to let Holiday tell her story in her own way.<ref name=\"Chronicle\" />\n\nIn his 2015 study, ''Billie Holiday: The Musician and the Myth'', [[John Szwed]] argued that ''Lady Sings the Blues'' is a generally accurate account of her life, and that co-writer Dufty was forced to water down or suppress material by the threat of legal action. According to the reviewer [[Richard Brody]], \"Szwed traces the stories of two important relationships that are missing from the book\u2014with [[Charles Laughton]], in the 1930s, and with [[Tallulah Bankhead]], in the late 1940s\u2014and of one relationship that's sharply diminished in the book, her affair with [[Orson Welles]] around the time of ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.\"<ref name=NY>{{cite news|author=Brody, Richard|authorlink=Richard Brody|title=The Art of Billie Holiday's Life |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-art-of-billie-holidays-life |accessdate=April 6, 2015|work=The New Yorker|date=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo accompany her autobiography, Holiday released the LP ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (Billie Holiday album)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'' in June 1956.

Interspersed among Holiday's songs, Millstein read aloud four lengthy passages from her autobiography, ''Lady Sings the Blues''. He later wrote:\n\n{{quote|The narration began with the ironic account of her birth in Baltimore \u2013 'Mom and Pop were just a couple of kids when they got married. He was eighteen, she was sixteen, and I was three' \u2013 and ended, very nearly shyly, with her hope for love and a long life with 'my man' at her side. It was evident, even then, that Miss Holiday was ill. I had known her casually over the years and I was shocked at her physical weakness. Her rehearsal had been desultory; her voice sounded tinny and trailed off; her body sagged tiredly. But I will not forget the metamorphosis that night. The lights went down, the musicians began to play and the narration began. Miss Holiday stepped from between the curtains, into the white spotlight awaiting her, wearing a white evening gown and white gardenias in her black hair. She was erect and beautiful; poised and smiling. And when the first section of narration was ended, she sang \u2013 with strength undiminished \u2013 with all of the art that was hers. I was very much moved. In the darkness, my face burned and my eyes. I recall only one thing. I smiled.\"<ref name=Millstein />}}\n\nThe critic [[Nat Hentoff]] of ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine, who attended the Carnegie Hall concert, wrote the remainder of the sleeve notes on the 1961 album. He wrote of Holiday's performance:\n\n{{quote|Throughout the night, Billie was in superior form to what had sometimes been the case in the last years of her life. Not only was there assurance of phrasing and intonation; but there was also an outgoing warmth, a palpable eagerness to reach and touch the audience. And there was mocking wit. A smile was often lightly evident on her lips and her eyes as if, for once, she could accept the fact that there were people who did dig her. The beat flowed in her uniquely sinuous, supple way of moving the story along; the words became her own experiences; and coursing through it all was Lady's sound \u2013 a texture simultaneously steel-edged and yet soft inside; a voice that was almost unbearably wise in disillusion and yet still childlike, again at the centre. The audience was hers from before she sang, greeting her and saying good-bye with heavy, loving applause. And at one time, the musicians too applauded. It was a night when Billie was on top, undeniably the best and most honest jazz singer alive.}}\n\nHer performance of \"Fine and Mellow\" on [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Sound of Jazz]]'' program is memorable for her interplay with her long-time friend [[Lester Young]]. Both were less than two years from death. Young died in March 1959. Holiday wanted to sing at his funeral, but her request was denied.\n\nWhen Holiday returned to Europe almost five years later, in 1959, she made one of her last television appearances for Granada's ''Chelsea at Nine'' in London. Her final studio recordings were made for [[MGM Records]] in 1959, with lush backing from [[Ray Ellis]] and his Orchestra, who had also accompanied her on the Columbia album ''[[Lady in Satin]]'' the previous year (see below).

Their stability, comfort and ease of use make them popular with novice cyclists, casual riders, commuters, and children.\n\nHybrid bikes can be called the [[Swiss Army knife|Swiss Army Knife]] of bicycles. Hybrid bikes harmonize the characteristics of road bikes, mountain bikes, and touring bikes. \n\nHybrids typically borrow the flat, straight handlebars and upright seating posture of a mountain bike, which many bicyclists find comfortable and intuitive. Hybrids also employ the lighter weight, thinner wheels and smooth tires of road bikes, allowing for greater speed and less exertion when riding on the road. Hybrid bikes often have places to mount racks and bags for transporting belongings, much like a touring bike.\n\nHybrid bikes have spawned numerous sub-categories satisfying diverse ridership.

In Britain, the roadster declined noticeably in popularity during the early 1970s, as a boom in recreational cycling caused manufacturers to concentrate on lightweight (23-30&nbsp;lb.), affordable [[Derailleur gears|derailleur]] sport bikes, actually slightly-modified versions of the racing bicycle of the era. In the 1980s, U.K. cyclists began to shift from road-only bicycles to all-terrain models such as the [[mountain bike]]. The mountain bike's sturdy frame and load-carrying ability gave it additional versatility as a utility bike, usurping the role previously filled by the roadster. By 1990, the roadster was almost dead; while annual U.K. bicycle sales reached an all-time record of 2.8 million, almost all of them were mountain and road/sport models. A different situation, however, was occurring in most Asian countries: roadsters are still widely made and used in countries such as China, India, Thailand, Vietnam and others as well in parts of north-western Europe. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Trekking bike==\n[[File:AERO-RS1-Trekking.jpg|thumb|Lightweight trekking bike]]\nA trekking bike is a hybrid with all the accessories necessary for [[bicycle touring]]{{spaced ndash}}mudguards, pannier rack, lights etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctc.org.uk/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=3508|title=Trekking bike|publisher=[[Cyclists' Touring Club]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheldonbrown.com/gloss_tp-z.html#trekking|title=Sheldon Brown's Bicycle Glossary \u2013 Trekking Bicycle|author=Sheldon Brown}}</ref>\n\n==Cross bike==\nCross bikes use a road [[bicycle frame]] similar to a [[racing bicycle|racing]] or sport/[[touring bicycle]], and are normally equipped with nearly flat handlebars to provide a more upright riding position than a racing or sport/touring bike.<ref name=\"Richard\"/> As a hybrid bike intended for general recreational and utility use, the ''cross bike'' differs from the [[cyclo-cross bicycle]], which is a racing bicycle purposely designed to compete in the sport of [[cyclo-cross]] competition. Cross bikes are fitted with 700c (ISO 622) [[bicycle wheel|wheels]] using somewhat wider semi-treaded tires ({{convert|1.125|\u2013|1.25|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) <!-- ({{convert|1.125|\u2013|1.25|in|mm|abbr=out|disp=or}}) --> than those fitted to most racing or sport/touring models.<ref name = sheldonbrown1/>\nThe additional tire width and tread is intended to give the cross bike hybrid some ability to deal with rough or littered surfaces that might be encountered on paved or unpaved bike trails, such as gravel, leaves, hard-packed sand, and shallow mud. Most cross bikes are biased towards moderate off-pavement use and light weight, and as such are not normally fitted with fenders, lights, or carrier racks. The larger 700c wheels are a little faster on paved surfaces and can give an advantage for longer trips or for touring purposes.<ref name=\"Richard\"   />\n\n==Commuter bike==\nThe commuter bike is a hybrid designed specifically for commuting over short or long distances. It typically features derailleur gearing, 700c wheels with fairly light {{convert|1+1/8|in|mm|adj=on}} tires, a carrier rack, full fenders, and a frame with suitable mounting points for attachment of various load-carrying baskets or panniers. It sometimes, though not always, has an enclosed chainguard to allow a rider to pedal the bike in long pants without entangling them in the chain.
