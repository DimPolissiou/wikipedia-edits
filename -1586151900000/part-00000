However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.

However, a fight occurs, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the [[Classical element|elemental spirits]] of [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], and [[Air (classical element)|Air]] of the forest. The spirits disappear and a wall of mist traps everyone in the Enchanted Forest. Young Agnarr barely escapes due to the help of an unknown savior.\n\nThree years after her coronation,{{efn|name=Timeline|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.}} Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]] the snowman, [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]] the ice harvester, and Kristoff's reindeer [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]]. One night, when Elsa hears a mysterious voice [[Kulning|calling out]] to her, she follows it and unintentionally awakens the elemental spirits, which forces everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. Grand Pabbie and the Trolls colony arrive at Arendelle and Pabbie informs that they must set things right by discovering the truth about the kingdom's past.\n\nElsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven embark to the Enchanted Forest, following the mysterious voice. After the mist parts at Elsa's touch, the Air spirit, in the form of a [[tornado]], appears and sweeps everyone in its vortex. Elsa stops it, forming a set of ice sculptures. The sisters discover the sculptures are images from their father's past. They encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the Fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers the spirit to be an agitated magical [[Salamanders in folklore|salamander]], and calms it down. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldra who had saved Agnarr, an Arendellian. They later learn the existence of a fifth spirit who will unite people and the magic of nature.\n\nElsa, Anna and Olaf continue to head north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river told by their mother to contain all explanations of the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf away to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the [[Neck (water spirit)|N\u00f8kk]], the Water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Reaching Ahtohallan, a [[glacier]], Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her was the memory of young Iduna's call; that her powers were given to her by nature because of Iduna's selfless act of saving Agnarr; and that Elsa herself is the fifth spirit.\n\nElsa then learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce the Northuldra's resources because of King Runeard's dislike of the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to incorporate the region into his kingdom. She also learns he was the one who initiated the conflict by killing the unarmed leader of the Northuldra. Elsa sends this information to Anna before becoming frozen due to venturing into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan. This in turn causes Olaf to fade away.\n\nAnna receives Elsa's message and concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. Anna finds and awakens the [[Giant|gigantic Earth spirits]] and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders aimed at Anna which destroy the dam, sending a flood down the [[fjord]] to the kingdom. Elsa thaws out and returns to Arendelle, diverting the flood and saving the kingdom.\n\nAs the mist disappears, Elsa reunites with Anna and revives Olaf. Kristoff asks Anna to marry him and she accepts. Elsa explains that she and Anna are now the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna becomes the Queen of Arendelle while Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who regularly visits Arendelle as peace has been restored.\n\nIn a [[post-credit scene]], Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events he experienced to Marshmallow and the Snowgies.{{efn|As depicted in the 2015 short ''[[Frozen Fever]]''.}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as [[Anna (Frozen)|Anna]], Princess of Arendelle, and Elsa's younger sister<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n** Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch (archived sound) as Young Anna<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Idina Menzel]] as [[Elsa (Frozen)|Elsa]], Queen of Arendelle and Anna's elder sister who possesses magical ice powers<ref name=\"Frozen2cast\">{{cite news|last1=Sharf|first1=Zack|title='Frozen 2' First Trailer: Elsa and Anna Return in Dazzling New Footage|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216153103/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/02/frozen-2-first-trailer-elsa-1202043757/|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n** Mattea Conforti and [[Eva Bella]] (archived sound) as Young Elsa<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>\n* [[Josh Gad]] as [[Olaf (Frozen)|Olaf]], a sentient snowman created by Elsa's magic<ref name=Frozen2cast />\n* [[Jonathan Groff]] as [[Kristoff (Frozen)|Kristoff]], an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend\n** Groff also provides the voices of [[Sven (Frozen)|Sven]] and the reindeer.<ref name=\"PressKit\" />\n* [[Sterling K.

The Z80 was conceived by [[Federico Faggin]] in late 1974 and developed by him and his 11 employees starting in early 1975. The first working samples were delivered in March 1976, and it was officially introduced on the market in July 1976. With the revenue from the Z80, the company built its own [[integrated circuit|chip factories]] and grew to over a thousand employees over the following two years.<ref>Source: Federico Faggin oral history.</ref>\n\nThe Zilog Z80 is a [[backward compatible|software-compatible]] extension and enhancement of the [[Intel 8080]] and, like it, was mainly aimed at [[embedded system]]s. Although used in that role, the Z80 also became one of the most widely used [[central processing unit|CPUs]] in [[desktop computer]]s and [[home computer]]s from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"popularity\" >{{cite book\n  |last=Balch |first=Mark |title=Complete Digital Design: A Comprehensive Guide to Digital Electronics and Computer System Architecture |series=Professional Engineering |date=2003-06-18 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional]] |location=[[New York City|New York, New York]] |isbn=0-07-140927-0 |page=122 |chapter=Digital Fundamentals\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Seybold Publications\">{{cite book\n  | title = The Seybold report on professional computing | publisher = Seybold Publications | date = 1983 | quote = In the 8-bit world, the two most popular microcomputers are the Z80 and 6502 computer chips. \n}}</ref> It was also common in military applications, [[musical equipment]] such as [[synthesizer]]s, and [[coin operated]] arcade games of the late 1970s and early 1980s including ''[[Pac-Man]]''.\n\nZilog licensed the Z80 to the US-based [[Synertek]] and [[Mostek]], which had helped them with initial production, as well as to a European [[second source]] manufacturer, [[SGS-Thomson|SGS]]. The [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|design]] was also copied by several Japanese, East European and Soviet manufacturers.{{efn-lr|Zilog included several \"traps\" in the layout of the chip to try to delay this copying. According to Faggin, an NEC engineer later told him it had cost them several months of work, before they were able to get their \u03bcPD780 to function.}} This won the Z80 acceptance in the world market since large companies like [[NEC]], [[Toshiba]], [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]], and [[Hitachi]] started to manufacture the device (or their own Z80-compatible clones or designs).\n\nIn recent decades Zilog has refocused on the ever-growing market for embedded systems and the most recent Z80-compatible [[microcontroller]] family, the fully [[Instruction pipelining|pipelined]] [[24-bit]] [[Zilog eZ80|eZ80]] with a [[linear]] 16&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] [[address range]], has been successfully introduced alongside the simpler Z80 and [[Zilog Z180|Z180]] products.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Zilog Z-80 Microprocessor ad May 1976.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A May 1976 advertisement for the Zilog Z-80 8-bit microprocessor]]\n[[Image:Z80-Z0840004PSC-HD.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Photo of the original Zilog Z80 [[microprocessor]] design in [[Depletion-load NMOS logic|depletion-load]] nMOS.

(This actual chip manufactured in 1990.)]] \n[[File:Z84C0010FEC LQFP.png|thumb|A [[CMOS]] Z80 in a [[Quad Flat Package]]]]\n\nThe Z80 came about when [[physicist]] [[Federico Faggin]] left [[Intel]] at the end of 1974 to found [[Zilog]] with {{ill|Ralph Ungermann|it}}. At [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], and later at [[Intel]], Faggin had been working on fundamental [[transistor]] and [[semiconductor]] manufacturing technology. He also developed the basic design methodology used for memories and microprocessors at Intel and led the work on the [[Intel 4004]], the [[Intel 8080|8080]] and several other ICs. [[Masatoshi Shima]], the principal logic and transistor level-designer of the 4004 and the 8080 under Faggin's supervision, joined the Zilog team.\n\nAccording to the designers, the primary targets for the Z80 CPU (and its optional support and peripheral ICs{{efn-lr|These were named the Z80 CTC (counter/timer), Z80 DMA (direct memory access), Z80 DART (dual asynchronous receiver-transmitter), Z80 SIO (synchronous communication controller), and Z80 PIO (parallel input/output)}}) were products like [[intelligent terminal]]s, [[Printer (computing)|high end printers]] and advanced [[cash register]]s as well as [[Telecommunication|telecom]] equipment, [[industrial robot]]s and other kinds of [[automation]] equipment.\n\nBy March 1976, Zilog had developed the Z80 as well as an accompanying [[assembler (computing)|assembler]] based [[microprocessor development board|development system]] for its customers, and by July 1976, this was formally launched onto the market.{{sfnp|Anderson|1994|p=51 }} Some of the Z80 support and peripheral ICs were under development at this point, and many of them were launched during the following year.\n\nEarly Z80s were manufactured by [[Synertek]] and [[Mostek]], before Zilog had its own manufacturing factory ready, in late 1976. These companies were chosen because they could do the [[ion implantation]] needed to create the [[depletion-load NMOS logic|depletion-mode]] [[MOSFETs]] that the Z80 design used as load transistors in order to cope with a single 5 Volt power supply.{{efn-lr|Zilog manufactured the Z80 as well as most of their other products for many years until they sold their [[manufacturing plant]]s and become the \"[[fabless]]\" company they are today.}}\n\nFaggin designed the [[instruction set]] to be [[binary compatible]] with the Intel 8080{{sfnp|Anderson|1994|p= 57 }}<ref name=\"brock\">{{cite book \n  | title = The second information revolution | last = Brock | first = Gerald W. | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-674-01178-6 \n}}</ref> so that most 8080 code, notably the [[CP/M]] [[operating system]] and Intel's [[PL/M]] compiler for 8080 (as well as its generated code), would run unmodified on the new Z80 CPU.

The Z80 could use memory with the same range of access times as the 8080 (or the 8086) at the same clock frequency.

In following years, however, the CMOS Z80 would dominate this market.\n\nSome organisations, such as [[British Telecom|BT]], remained loyal to the 8085 for embedded applications owing to their familiarity with it, and to its on-chip support for a serial interface and multi-level interrupt architecture. Perhaps a key to the initial success of the Z80 was the built-in DRAM refresh, and other features which allowed systems to be built with fewer support chips (Z80 [[embedded system]]s typically use [[static RAM]] and hence do not need this refresh). \n\nFor the original [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] design, the specified upper clock frequency limit increased successively from the introductory 2.5&nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]], via the well known 4&nbsp;MHz (Z80A), up to 6 (Z80B) and 8&nbsp;MHz (Z80H).<ref>{{cite book\n  | title = Popular Computing | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | date = 1983 | page = 15 \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine\n  |magazine= [[InfoWorld]] | last = Markoff| first=John | title = Zilog's speedy Z80 soups up 8-bit to 16-bit performance | publisher = InfoWorld Media Group | date =1982-10-18 | page = 1 | issn = 0199-6649 \n}}</ref> The NMOS version has been produced as a 10&nbsp;MHz part since the late 1980s.

There is no dedicated adder for offsets or separate incrementer for R, and no need for more than a single 16-bit temporary register WZ (although the incrementer latches are also used as a 16-bit temporary register, in other contexts). It is the PC and IR registers that are placed in a separate group, with a detachable bus segment, to allow updates of these registers in parallel with the main register bank.<ref >{{Cite web|url=http://www.righto.com/2014/10/how-z80s-registers-are-implemented-down.html|title=Down to the silicon: how the Z80's registers are implemented}}</ref>]]\n\nThe programming model and register set of the Z80 are fairly conventional, ultimately based on the register structure of the [[Datapoint 2200]]. The Z80 was designed as an extension of the [[Intel 8080|8080]], created by the same engineers, which in turn was an extension of the [[Intel 8008|8008]]. The 8008 was basically a [[PMOS logic|PMOS]] implementation of the TTL-based CPU of the Datapoint 2200.{{efn-lr|The related [[Intel 8086|8086]] family also inherited this register design.}}\n\nThe 2200 design allowed 8-bit registers H and L (High and Low) to be paired into a 16-bit address register HL.{{efn-lr|This variable HL pointer was actually the only way to access memory (for data) in the Datapoint 2200, and hence also in the Intel 8008. No direct addresses could be used to access data.}} In the 8080, this pairing was added to the BC and DE pairs as well, while HL was generalized to allow use as a 16-bit accumulator, not just an address register. The 8080 also introduced the important 8-bit immediate data mode for accumulator operations, and immediate 16-bit data for HL, BC and DE loads. Furthermore, direct 16-bit copying between HL and memory was now possible, using a direct address.\n\nThe Z80 [[Orthogonal instruction set|orthogonalized]] this further by making all 16-bit register pairs, including IX and IY, more general purpose, as well as allowing 16-bit copying directly to and from memory for all of these pairs. The 16-bit IX and IY registers in the Z80 are primarily intended as base address-registers, where a particular instruction supplies a constant offset that is added to the previous values, but they are also usable as 16-bit accumulators, among other things. The Z80 also introduced a new signed [[overflow flag]] and complemented the fairly simple 16-bit arithmetics of the 8080 with dedicated instructions for ''signed'' 16-bit arithmetics.\n\nThe 8080-compatible registers AF, BC, DE, HL are duplicated as two separate banks in the Z80,<ref>{{cite book | title = Kilobaud | publisher = 1001001 | date= 1977 | page = 22 }}</ref> where the processor can quickly switch from one bank to the other;<ref>{{cite book |last = Zaks |first = Rodnay |title=Programming the Z80 |edition=3rd |publisher=SYBEX |date= 1982 |isbn = 978-0-89588-069-7 |page = 62 }}</ref> a feature useful for speeding up responses to single-level, high-priority interrupts. A similar feature was present in the 2200, but was never implemented at Intel. The dual register-set is very useful in the embedded role, as it improves interrupt handling performance, but found widespread use in the personal computer role as an additional set of general registers for complex code like [[floating point]] arithmetics or home computer games.\n\n====Registers====\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:88%\"\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |''The Z80 registers''\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:10px;

This enables fast context switches for interrupt service routines: <code>EX AF, AF'</code> may be used alone, for really simple and fast interrupt routines, or together with <code>EXX</code> to swap the whole BC, DE, HL set. This is still several times as fast as pushing the same registers on the [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]]. Slower, lower priority, or multi level interrupts normally use the stack to store registers, however.\n\nThe ''refresh register'', <code>R</code>, increments each time the CPU fetches an opcode (or opcode prefix) and has no simple relationship with program execution. This has sometimes been used to generate [[pseudorandom]] numbers in games, and also in software protection schemes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} It has also been employed as a \"hardware\" counter in some designs; an example of this is the [[ZX81]], which lets it keep track of character positions on the TV screen by triggering an interrupt at [[integer overflow|wrap around]] (by connecting INT to A6).\n\nThe ''interrupt vector register'', <code>I</code>, is used for the Z80 specific mode 2 interrupts (selected by the <code>IM 2</code> instruction). It supplies the high byte of the base address for a 128-entry table of [[interrupt service routine|service routine]] addresses which are selected via an index sent to the CPU during an [[interrupt]] acknowledge cycle; this index is simply the low byte part of the pointer to the tabulated indirect address pointing to the service routine.<ref name=\"interruptmodes\" /> The pointer identifies a particular peripheral chip or peripheral function or event, where the chips are normally connected in a so-called [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] for priority resolution. Like the refresh register, this register has also sometimes been used creatively; in interrupt modes 0 and 1 (or in a system not using interrupts) it can be used as simply another 8-bit data register.\n\nThe instructions <code>LD A,R</code> and <code>LD A,I</code> affect the Z80 flags register, unlike all the other <code>LD</code> (load) instructions. The Sign (bit 7) and Zero (bit 6) flags are set according to the data loaded from the Refresh or Interrupt source registers. For both instructions, the Parity/Overflow flag (bit 2) is set according to the current state of the IFF2 flip-flop.<ref >{{cite web\n  |title=Z80 Flag Affection|url=http://www.z80.info/z80sflag.htm|website=www.z80.info|publisher=Thomas Scherrer|accessdate=2016-06-14\n}}</ref>\n\n===Z80 assembly language===\n\n====Datapoint 2200 and Intel 8008====\nThe first Intel 8008 [[assembly language]] was based on a very simple (but systematic) syntax inherited from the Datapoint 2200 design. This original syntax was later transformed into a new, somewhat more traditional, assembly language form for this same original 8008 chip. At about the same time, the new assembly language was also extended to accommodate the added addressing possibilities in the more advanced Intel 8080 chip (the 8008 and 8080 shared a language subset without being [[binary compatible]]; however, the 8008 was binary compatible with the Datapoint 2200).\n\nIn this process, the mnemonic <code>L</code>, for ''LOAD'', was replaced by various abbreviations of the words ''LOAD'', ''STORE'' and ''MOVE'', intermixed with other symbolic letters. The mnemonic letter <code>M</code>, for ''memory'' (referenced by HL), was lifted out from within the instruction mnemonic to become a syntactically freestanding ''operand'', while registers and combinations of registers became very inconsistently denoted; either by abbreviated operands (MVI D, LXI H and so on), within the instruction mnemonic itself (LDA, LHLD and so on), or both at the same time (LDAX B, STAX D and so on).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This is possible because the operands themselves carry enough information.\n\nThese principles made it straightforward to find names and forms for all new Z80 instructions, as well as [[orthogonalization]]s of old ones, such as <code>LD BC,(1234)</code>.\n\nApart from naming differences, and despite a certain discrepancy in basic register structure, the Z80 and [[Intel 8086|8086]] syntax are virtually [[isomorphic]] for a large portion of instructions. Only quite superficial similarities (such as the word MOV, or the letter X, for extended register) exist between the 8080 and 8086 assembly languages, although 8080 programs can be translated to 8086 assembly language by [[Assembly language translator|translator program]]s.<ref name=\"Scanlon_1988\"/><ref name=\"Nelson_1988\"/>\n\n===Instruction set and encoding===\nThe Z80 uses 252 out of the available 256 codes as single byte opcodes (\"root instruction\"); the four remaining codes are used extensively as [[opcode prefix]]es:<ref name=\"instructions\">{{cite web | url = http://www.z80.info/z80brief.htm | title = Z80 CPU Introduction | publisher = Zilog | date = 1995 | quote = It has a language of 252 root instructions and with the reserved 4 bytes as prefixes, accesses an additional 308 instructions. }}</ref> CB and ED enable extra instructions and DD or FD selects IX+d or IY+d respectively (in some cases without displacement d) in place of HL. This scheme gives the Z80 a large number of permutations of instructions and registers; Zilog categorizes these into 158 different \"instruction types\", 78 of which are the same as those of the Intel 8080<ref name=\"instructions\" /> (allowing operation of most 8080 programs on a Z80). The Zilog documentation further groups instructions into the following categories:\n* 8-bit arithmetic and logic operations\n* 16-bit arithmetic\n* 8-bit load\n* 16-bit load\n* Bit set, reset, and test\n* Call, return, and restart\n* Exchange, block transfer, and search\n* General purpose arithmetic and CPU control\n* Input and output\n* Jump\n* Rotate and shift\n\nNo multiply instructions are available in the original Z80.<ref>{{cite book |title=Software Solutions for Engineers And Scientists |last=Sanchez |first=Julio |last2=Canton |first2=Maria P. |publisher=Taylor & Francis |date=2008 |page=65 |isbn=978-1-4200-4302-0 |quote=The 8-bit microprocessors that preceded the 80x86 family (such as the Intel 8080, the Zilog Z80, and the Motorola) did not include multiplication.}}</ref> Different sizes and variants of additions, shifts, and rotates have somewhat differing effects on flags because most of the flag-changing properties of the 8080 were copied. However, the parity flag bit P of the 8080 (bit 2) is called P/V (parity/overflow) in the Z80 as it serves the additional purpose of a twos complement overflow indicator, a lacking feature in the 8080. Arithmetic instructions on the Z80 set it to indicate overflow rather than parity, while bitwise instructions still use it as a parity flag. This new overflow flag is used for all new Z80-specific 16-bit operations ({{code|ADC}}, {{code|SBC}}) as well as for 8-bit arithmetic operations, although the 16-bit operations inherited from the 8080 ({{code|ADD}}, {{code|INC}}, {{code|DEC}}) do not affect it. Also, bit 1 of the flags register (a spare bit on the 8080) is used as a flag, N, that indicates whether the last arithmetic instruction executed was a subtraction or addition. The Z80 version of the {{code|DAA}} instruction (Decimal Adjust Accumulator for [[Binary-coded decimal|BCD]] arithmetic) checks the N flag and behaves accordingly, so a (hypothetical) subtraction followed later by {{code|DAA}} will yield a different result on an old 8080 than on the Z80. However, this would likely be erroneous code on the 8080, as {{code|DAA}} was defined for addition only on that processor.\n\nThe Z80 has six new {{code|LD}} instructions that can load the DE, BC, and SP register pairs from memory, and load memory from these three register pairs\u2014unlike the 8080.<ref>{{cite web|title=8080/Z80 Instruction Sets|url=http://nemesis.lonestar.org/computers/tandy/software/apps/m4/qd/opcodes.html|website=Quick and Dirty 8080 Assembler|publisher=Frank Durda|accessdate=2016-07-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211094642/http://nemesis.lonestar.org/computers/tandy/software/apps/m4/qd/opcodes.html|archive-date=2016-02-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> As on the 8080, load instructions do not affect the flags (except for the special purpose I and R register loads). A result of a regular encoding (common with the 8080) is that each of the 8-bit registers can be loaded from themselves (e.g. {{code|LD A,A}}). This is effectively a {{code|NOP}}.\n\nNew block transfer instructions can move up to 64 kilobytes from memory to memory or between memory and I/O peripheral ports. Block instructions {{code|LDIR}} and {{code|LDDR}} (LoaD,Increment/Decrement,Repeat) use HL to point to the source address, DE to the destination address, and BC as a byte counter. Bytes are copied from source to destination, the pointers are incremented or decremented, and the byte counter is decremented until BC reaches zero. Non-repeating versions {{code|LDI}} and {{code|LDD}} move a single byte and bump the pointers and byte counter, which if becomes zero resets the P/V flag. Corresponding memory-to-I/O instructions {{code|INIR}}, {{code|INDR}}, {{code|OTIR}}, {{code|OTDR}}, {{code|INI}}, {{code|IND}}, {{code|OUTI}} and {{code|OUTD}} operate similarly. The Z80 can input and output any register to an I/O port using register C to designate the port (the 8080 only performs I/O through the accumulator A).\n\nThe last group of block instructions perform a {{code|CP}} compare operation between the byte at (HL) and the accumulator A. Register pair DE is not used. The repeating versions {{code|CPIR}} and {{code|CPDR}} only terminate if BC goes to zero or a match is found. HL is left pointing to the byte after ({{code|CPIR}}) or before ({{code|CPDR}}) the matching byte. If no match is found the Z flag is reset. There are non-repeating versions {{code|CPI}} and {{code|CPD}}.\n\nUnlike the 8080, the Z80 can jump to a relative address ({{code|JR}} instead of {{code|JP}}) using a signed 8-bit displacement. Only the Zero and Carry flags can be tested for these new two-byte {{code|JR}} instructions. A two-byte instruction specialized for program looping is also new to the Z80. {{code|DJNZ}} (Decrement Jump if Non-Zero) takes a signed 8-bit displacement as an immediate operand. The B register is decremented. If the result is nonzero then program execution jumps relative to the address of the PC plus the displacement. The flags remain unaltered. To perform an equivalent loop on an 8080 would require separate decrement and jump (to a two-byte absolute address) instructions, and the flag register would be altered.\n\nThe index register (IX/IY, often abbreviated XY) instructions can be useful for accessing data organised in fixed heterogenous structures (such as [[record (computer science)|record]]s) or at fixed offsets relative a variable base address (as in [[recursive]] [[stack frame]]s) and can also reduce code size by removing the need for multiple short instructions using non-indexed registers. However, although they may save speed in some contexts when compared to long/complex \"equivalent\" sequences of simpler operations, they incur a lot of additional CPU time (''e.g.'' 19 T-states to access one indexed memory location ''vs.'' as little as 11 to access the same memory using HL and {{code|INC}} to point to the next). Thus, for simple or linear accesses of data, use of IX and IY tend to be slower and occupy more memory. Still, they may be useful in cases where the 'main' registers are all occupied, by removing the need to save/restore registers. Their officially undocumented 8-bit halves (see below) can be especially useful in this context, for they incur less slowdown than their 16-bit parents. Similarly, instructions for 16-bit additions are not particularly fast (11 clocks) in the original Z80; nonetheless, they are about twice as fast as performing the same calculations using 8-bit operations, and equally important, they reduce register usage. It was not uncommon for programmers to \"poke\" different (typically calculated dynamically) offset displacement bytes into indexed instructions; this is an example of [[self-modifying code]] which was regular practice on nearly all early 8-bit processors with non-[[Instruction pipelining#Special situations|pipelined]] execution units.\n\nThe index registers have a parallel instruction to {{code|JP (HL)}}, which is {{code|JP (XY)}}. This is often seen in stack-oriented languages like [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] which at the end of every Forth word (atomic subroutines comprising the language) must jump unconditionally back to their thread interpreter routines. Typically this jump instruction appears many hundreds of times in an application, and using {{code|JP (XY)}} rather than {{code|JP THREAD}} saves a byte and two t-states each occurrence. This naturally makes the index register unavailable for any other use, or else the need to constantly reload it would negate its efficiency.\n\nThe 10-year-newer microcoded [[Z180]] design could initially afford more \"chip area\", permitting a slightly more efficient implementation (using a wider [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]], among other things); similar things can be said for the [[Zilog Z800|Z800]], [[Z280]], and [[Z380]]. However, it was not until the fully pipelined [[Zilog eZ80|eZ80]] was launched in 2001 that those instructions finally became approximately as cycle-efficient as it is technically possible to make them, i.e. given the Z80 encodings combined with the capability to do an 8-bit read or write every clock cycle.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n====Undocumented instructions====\nThe index registers, IX and IY, were intended as flexible 16 bit pointers, enhancing the ability to manipulate memory, stack frames and data structures. Officially, they were treated as 16-bit only. In reality they were implemented as a pair of 8-bit registers,<ref>{{cite book | title = The free software catalog and directory | last = Froehlich | first = Robert A. | publisher = Crown Publishers | date = 1984| isbn=978-0-517-55448-7 | page = 133 | quote = Undocumented Z80 codes allow 8 bit operations with IX and IY registers. }}</ref> in the same fashion as the HL register, which is accessible either as 16 bits or separately as the ''H''igh and ''L''ow registers.

T. |quote = If an opcode works with the registers HL, H or L then if that opcode is preceded by #DD (or #FD) it works on IX, IXH or IXL (or IY, IYH, IYL), with some exceptions. The exceptions are instructions like LD H,IXH and LD L,IYH.}}</ref> Zilog published the opcodes and related mnemonics for the intended functions, but did not document the fact that every opcode that allowed manipulation of the H and L registers was equally valid for the 8 bit portions of the IX and IY registers. For example, the opcode 26h followed by an immediate byte value {{code|(LD H,n)}} will load that value into the H register. Preceding this two-byte instruction with the IX register's opcode prefix, DD, would instead result in the most significant 8 bits of the IX register being loaded with that same value. A notable exception to this would be instructions similar to {{code|LD H,(IX+d)}} which make use of both the HL and IX or IY registers in the same instruction;<ref name=\"undocz80\" /> in this case the DD prefix is only applied to the (IX+d) portion of the instruction. The halves of the XY registers could also hold operands for 8-bit arithmetic, logical and compare instructions, sparing the regular 8-bit registers for other use. The undocumented ability to increment and decrement the upper half of an index register made it easy to expand the range of the normal indexed instructions, without having to resort to the legal {{code|ADD/SBC XY,DE}} or {{code|ADD/SBC XY,BC}}. \n\nThere are several other undocumented instructions as well.<ref>Robin Nixon ''The Amstrad Notepad Advanced User Guide'' ,Robin Nixon, 1993 {{ISBN|1-85058-515-6}}, pages 219-223</ref> Undocumented or [[illegal opcode]]s are not detected by the Z80 and have various effects, some of which are useful. However, as they are not part of the formal definition of the instruction set, different implementations of the Z80 are not guaranteed to work the same way for every undocumented opcode.\n\n====Bugs====\nThe {{code|OTDR}} instruction does not conform to the Z80 documentation. Both the {{code|OTDR}} and {{code|OTIR}} instructions are supposed to leave the carry (C) flag unmodified. The {{code|OTIR}} instruction operates correctly; however, during the execution of the {{code|OTDR}} instruction, the carry flag takes the results of a spurious compare between the accumulator (A) and the last output of the {{code|OTDR}} instruction.\n\n===Example code===\nThe following Z80 [[assembly language|assembly]] source code is for a subroutine named <code>memcpy</code> that copies a block of data bytes of a given size from one location to another. Important: the example code does not handle a certain case where the destination block overlaps the source; a fatal bug. The sample code is extremely inefficient, intended to illustrate various instruction types, rather than best practices for speed. In particular, the Z80 has a single instruction that will execute the entire loop (<code>LDIR</code>). The data block is copied one byte at a time, and the data movement and looping logic utilizes 16-bit operations. Note that the assembled code is binary-compatible with the [[Intel 8080]] and [[Intel 8085|8085]] CPUs.\n\n<!--Note: This is not intended to be optimized code, but to illustrate the variety of instructions available on the CPU-->\n{|\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|<source lang=\"text\" highlight=\"13\">\n 1000            \n 1000            \n 1000 78         \n 1001 B1         \n 1002 C8         \n 1003 1A         \n 1004 77         \n 1005 13         \n 1006 23         \n 1007 0B         \n 1008 C3 00 10   \n 100B            \n</source>\n|<source lang=\"nasm\" highlight=\"13\">\n ; memcpy --\n ; Copy a block of memory from one location to another.\n ;\n ; Entry registers\n ;      BC - Number of bytes to copy\n ;      DE - Address of source data block\n ;      HL - Address of target data block\n ;\n ; Return registers\n ;      BC - Zero\n\n             org     1000h       ;Origin at 1000h\n memcpy      public\n loop        ld      a,b         ;Test BC,\n             or      c           ;If BC = 0,\n             ret     z           ;Return\n             ld      a,(de)      ;Load A from (DE)\n             ld      (hl),a      ;Store A into (HL)\n             inc     de          ;Increment DE\n             inc     hl          ;Increment HL\n             dec     bc          ;Decrement BC\n             jp      loop        ;Repeat the loop\n             end\n</source>\n|}\n\n===Instruction execution===\nEach instruction is executed in steps that are usually termed [[machine cycle]]s (M-cycles), each of which can take between three and six clock periods (T-cycles).<ref>{{cite book | title = Z80 Family CPU User Manual | author = Zilog | publisher = Zilog | date = 2005 | page = 11  |url=http://www.zilog.com/docs/z80/um0080.pdf }}</ref> Each M-cycle corresponds roughly to one memory access or internal operation.

This avoids cumbersome asynchronous logic and makes the control signals behave consistently at a wide range of clock frequencies. It also means that a higher frequency crystal must be used than without this subdivision of machine cycles (approximately 2\u20133 times higher). It does not imply tighter requirements on [[memory access time]]s, since a high resolution clock allows more precise control of memory timings and so memory can be active in parallel with the CPU to a greater extent, allowing more efficient use of available memory bandwidth.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOne central example of this is that, for [[opcode fetch]], the Z80 combines two full clock cycles into a memory access period (the M1-signal). In the Z80 this signal lasts for a relatively larger part of the typical instruction execution time than in a design such as the [[Motorola 6800|6800]], 6502, or similar, where this period would typically last typically 30-40% of a clock cycle.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} With memory chip affordability (i.e. access times around 450-250&nbsp;ns in the 1980s{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}) typically determining the fastest possible access time, this meant that such designs were locked to a significantly longer clock cycle (i.e. lower internal clock speed) than the Z80.\n\nMemory was generally slow compared to the state machine sub-cycles (clock cycles) used in contemporary microprocessors. The shortest machine cycle that could safely be used in embedded designs has therefore often been limited by memory access times, not by the maximum CPU frequency (especially so during the home computer era). However, this relation has slowly changed during the last decades, particularly regarding [[Static random access memory|SRAM]]; cacheless, single-cycle designs such as the [[Zilog eZ80|eZ80]] have therefore become much more meaningful recently.\n\nThe content of the refresh register R is sent out on the lower half of the address bus along with a refresh control signal while the CPU is decoding and executing the fetched instruction. During refresh the contents of the Interrupt register I are sent out on the upper half of the address bus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Z80 User Manual, Special Registers pg. 3|url=http://www.zilog.com/force_download.php?filepath=YUhSMGNEb3ZMM2QzZHk1NmFXeHZaeTVqYjIwdlpHOWpjeTk2T0RBdlZVMHdNRGd3TG5Ca1pnPT0=|website=www.zilog.com|publisher=Zilog|accessdate=2016-06-14}}</ref>\n\n===Compatible peripherals===\nZilog introduced a number of peripheral parts for the Z80, which all support the Z80's interrupt handling system and I/O address space.

While some Z80-based computers such as the [[Osborne 1]] used \"Motorola-style\" [[Memory-mapped I/O|memory mapped input/output]] devices, usually the I/O space was used to address one of the many Zilog peripheral chips compatible with the Z80. Zilog I/O chips supported the Z80's new mode 2 interrupts which simplified interrupt handling for large numbers of peripherals.\n\nThe Z80 was officially described as supporting 16-bit (64&nbsp;KB) memory addressing, and 8-bit (256 ports) I/O-addressing. All I/O instructions actually assert the entire 16-bit address bus. OUT (C),reg and IN reg,(C) places the contents of the entire 16 bit BC register on the address bus;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://z80.info/z80undoc3.txt | title = Z80 Undocumented Features (in software behaviour) | last = Young | first = Sean | date = 1998 | quote = The I/O instructions use the whole of the address bus, not just the lower 8 bits. So in fact, you can have 65536 I/O ports in a Z80 system (the Spectrum uses this). IN r,(C), OUT (C),r and all the I/O block instructions put the whole of BC on the address bus. IN A,(n) and OUT (n),A put A*256+n on the address bus. }}</ref> OUT (n),A and IN A,(n) places the contents of the A register on b8-b15 of the address bus and n on b0-b7 of the address bus. A designer could choose to decode the entire 16 bit address bus on I/O operations in order to take advantage of this feature, or use the high half of the address bus to select subfeatures of the I/O device. This feature has also been used to minimise decoding hardware requirements, such as in the [[Amstrad CPC]]/[[Amstrad PCW|PCW]] and [[ZX81]].\n\n==Second sources and derivatives==\n\n===Second sources===\n[[Mostek]], who produced the first Z80 for Zilog, offered it as second-source as MK3880.

The \u00b5PD780C was used in Sinclair's [[ZX80]], [[ZX81]] and early versions of the [[ZX Spectrum]], in several [[MSX]] computers, and in musical synthesizers such as [[Oberheim OB-8]] and others, while the \u00b5PD780-1 (a Z80A part which ran at 4&nbsp;MHz) was used in Sega's [[SG-1000]] game console.

It was very popular and was used in [[VEB Robotron|Robotron]]'s and VEB Mikroelektronik M\u00fchlhausen's computer systems (such as the [[KC85]]-series) and also in many self-made computer systems. In [[Romania]] another unlicensed clone could be found, named [[MMN80CPU]] and produced by [[Electronics industry in the Socialist Republic of Romania|Microelectronica]], used in home computers like TIM-S, HC, COBRA.\n\nAlso, several clones of Z80 were created in the [[Soviet Union]], notable ones being the [[T34 (microprocessor)|T34BM1]], also called [[\u041a\u04201858\u0412\u041c1]] (parallelling the Soviet 8080-clone [[KR580VM80A]]). The first marking was used in pre-production series, while the second had to be used for a larger production.

The Z80 was conceived by [[Federico Faggin]] in late 1974 and developed by him and his 11 employees starting in early 1975. The first working samples were delivered in March 1976, and it was officially introduced on the market in July 1976. With the revenue from the Z80, the company built its own [[integrated circuit|chip factories]] and grew to over a thousand employees over the following two years.<ref>Source: Federico Faggin oral history.</ref>\n\nThe Zilog Z80 is a [[backward compatible|software-compatible]] extension and enhancement of the [[Intel 8080]] and, like it, was mainly aimed at [[embedded system]]s.

The [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|design]] was also copied by several Japanese, East European and Soviet manufacturers.{{efn-lr|Zilog included several \"traps\" in the layout of the chip to try to delay this copying.

At [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], and later at [[Intel]], Faggin had been working on fundamental [[transistor]] and [[semiconductor]] manufacturing technology. He also developed the basic design methodology used for memories and microprocessors at Intel and led the work on the [[Intel 4004]], the [[Intel 8080|8080]] and several other ICs. [[Masatoshi Shima]], the principal logic and transistor level-designer of the 4004 and the 8080 under Faggin's supervision, joined the Zilog team.\n\nAccording to the designers, the primary targets for the Z80 CPU (and its optional support and peripheral ICs{{efn-lr|These were named the Z80 CTC (counter/timer), Z80 DMA (direct memory access), Z80 DART (dual asynchronous receiver-transmitter), Z80 SIO (synchronous communication controller), and Z80 PIO (parallel input/output)}}) were products like [[intelligent terminal]]s, [[Printer (computing)|high end printers]] and advanced [[cash register]]s as well as [[Telecommunication|telecom]] equipment, [[industrial robot]]s and other kinds of [[automation]] equipment.\n\nBy March 1976, Zilog had developed the Z80 as well as an accompanying [[assembler (computing)|assembler]] based [[microprocessor development board|development system]] for its customers, and by July 1976, this was formally launched onto the market.{{sfnp|Anderson|1994|p=51 }} Some of the Z80 support and peripheral ICs were under development at this point, and many of them were launched during the following year.\n\nEarly Z80s were manufactured by [[Synertek]] and [[Mostek]], before Zilog had its own manufacturing factory ready, in late 1976. These companies were chosen because they could do the [[ion implantation]] needed to create the [[depletion-load NMOS logic|depletion-mode]] [[MOSFETs]] that the Z80 design used as load transistors in order to cope with a single 5 Volt power supply.{{efn-lr|Zilog manufactured the Z80 as well as most of their other products for many years until they sold their [[manufacturing plant]]s and become the \"[[fabless]]\" company they are today.}}\n\nFaggin designed the [[instruction set]] to be [[binary compatible]] with the Intel 8080{{sfnp|Anderson|1994|p= 57 }}<ref name=\"brock\">{{cite book \n  | title = The second information revolution | last = Brock | first = Gerald W. | publisher = Harvard University Press | date = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-674-01178-6 \n}}</ref> so that most 8080 code, notably the [[CP/M]] [[operating system]] and Intel's [[PL/M]] compiler for 8080 (as well as its generated code), would run unmodified on the new Z80 CPU.

The Z80 could use memory with the same range of access times as the 8080 (or the 8086) at the same clock frequency.

In following years, however, the CMOS Z80 would dominate this market.\n\nSome organisations, such as [[British Telecom|BT]], remained loyal to the 8085 for embedded applications owing to their familiarity with it, and to its on-chip support for a serial interface and multi-level interrupt architecture. Perhaps a key to the initial success of the Z80 was the built-in DRAM refresh, and other features which allowed systems to be built with fewer support chips (Z80 [[embedded system]]s typically use [[static RAM]] and hence do not need this refresh). \n\nFor the original [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] design, the specified upper clock frequency limit increased successively from the introductory 2.5&nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]], via the well known 4&nbsp;MHz (Z80A), up to 6 (Z80B) and 8&nbsp;MHz (Z80H).<ref>{{cite book\n  | title = Popular Computing | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | date = 1983 | page = 15 \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine\n  |magazine= [[InfoWorld]] | last = Markoff| first=John | title = Zilog's speedy Z80 soups up 8-bit to 16-bit performance | publisher = InfoWorld Media Group | date =1982-10-18 | page = 1 | issn = 0199-6649 \n}}</ref> The NMOS version has been produced as a 10&nbsp;MHz part since the late 1980s.

There is no dedicated adder for offsets or separate incrementer for R, and no need for more than a single 16-bit temporary register WZ (although the incrementer latches are also used as a 16-bit temporary register, in other contexts). It is the PC and IR registers that are placed in a separate group, with a detachable bus segment, to allow updates of these registers in parallel with the main register bank.<ref >{{Cite web|url=http://www.righto.com/2014/10/how-z80s-registers-are-implemented-down.html|title=Down to the silicon: how the Z80's registers are implemented}}</ref>]]\n\nThe programming model and register set of the Z80 are fairly conventional, ultimately based on the register structure of the [[Datapoint 2200]]. The Z80 was designed as an extension of the [[Intel 8080|8080]], created by the same engineers, which in turn was an extension of the [[Intel 8008|8008]]. The 8008 was basically a [[PMOS logic|PMOS]] implementation of the TTL-based CPU of the Datapoint 2200.{{efn-lr|The related [[Intel 8086|8086]] family also inherited this register design.}}\n\nThe 2200 design allowed 8-bit registers H and L (High and Low) to be paired into a 16-bit address register HL.{{efn-lr|This variable HL pointer was actually the only way to access memory (for data) in the Datapoint 2200, and hence also in the Intel 8008. No direct addresses could be used to access data.}} In the 8080, this pairing was added to the BC and DE pairs as well, while HL was generalized to allow use as a 16-bit accumulator, not just an address register. The 8080 also introduced the important 8-bit immediate data mode for accumulator operations, and immediate 16-bit data for HL, BC and DE loads. Furthermore, direct 16-bit copying between HL and memory was now possible, using a direct address.\n\nThe Z80 [[Orthogonal instruction set|orthogonalized]] this further by making all 16-bit register pairs, including IX and IY, more general purpose, as well as allowing 16-bit copying directly to and from memory for all of these pairs. The 16-bit IX and IY registers in the Z80 are primarily intended as base address-registers, where a particular instruction supplies a constant offset that is added to the previous values, but they are also usable as 16-bit accumulators, among other things. The Z80 also introduced a new signed [[overflow flag]] and complemented the fairly simple 16-bit arithmetics of the 8080 with dedicated instructions for ''signed'' 16-bit arithmetics.\n\nThe 8080-compatible registers AF, BC, DE, HL are duplicated as two separate banks in the Z80,<ref>{{cite book | title = Kilobaud | publisher = 1001001 | date= 1977 | page = 22 }}</ref> where the processor can quickly switch from one bank to the other;<ref>{{cite book |last = Zaks |first = Rodnay |title=Programming the Z80 |edition=3rd |publisher=SYBEX |date= 1982 |isbn = 978-0-89588-069-7 |page = 62 }}</ref> a feature useful for speeding up responses to single-level, high-priority interrupts. A similar feature was present in the 2200, but was never implemented at Intel. The dual register-set is very useful in the embedded role, as it improves interrupt handling performance, but found widespread use in the personal computer role as an additional set of general registers for complex code like [[floating point]] arithmetics or home computer games.\n\n====Registers====\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:88%\"\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |''The Z80 registers''\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:10px;

This enables fast context switches for interrupt service routines: <code>EX AF, AF'</code> may be used alone, for really simple and fast interrupt routines, or together with <code>EXX</code> to swap the whole BC, DE, HL set. This is still several times as fast as pushing the same registers on the [[Stack (abstract data type)|stack]]. Slower, lower priority, or multi level interrupts normally use the stack to store registers, however.\n\nThe ''refresh register'', <code>R</code>, increments each time the CPU fetches an opcode (or opcode prefix) and has no simple relationship with program execution. This has sometimes been used to generate [[pseudorandom]] numbers in games, and also in software protection schemes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} It has also been employed as a \"hardware\" counter in some designs; an example of this is the [[ZX81]], which lets it keep track of character positions on the TV screen by triggering an interrupt at [[integer overflow|wrap around]] (by connecting INT to A6).\n\nThe ''interrupt vector register'', <code>I</code>, is used for the Z80 specific mode 2 interrupts (selected by the <code>IM 2</code> instruction). It supplies the high byte of the base address for a 128-entry table of [[interrupt service routine|service routine]] addresses which are selected via an index sent to the CPU during an [[interrupt]] acknowledge cycle; this index is simply the low byte part of the pointer to the tabulated indirect address pointing to the service routine.<ref name=\"interruptmodes\" /> The pointer identifies a particular peripheral chip or peripheral function or event, where the chips are normally connected in a so-called [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] for priority resolution. Like the refresh register, this register has also sometimes been used creatively; in interrupt modes 0 and 1 (or in a system not using interrupts) it can be used as simply another 8-bit data register.\n\nThe instructions <code>LD A,R</code> and <code>LD A,I</code> affect the Z80 flags register, unlike all the other <code>LD</code> (load) instructions. The Sign (bit 7) and Zero (bit 6) flags are set according to the data loaded from the Refresh or Interrupt source registers. For both instructions, the Parity/Overflow flag (bit 2) is set according to the current state of the IFF2 flip-flop.<ref >{{cite web\n  |title=Z80 Flag Affection|url=http://www.z80.info/z80sflag.htm|website=www.z80.info|publisher=Thomas Scherrer|accessdate=2016-06-14\n}}</ref>\n\n===Z80 assembly language===\n\n====Datapoint 2200 and Intel 8008====\nThe first Intel 8008 [[assembly language]] was based on a very simple (but systematic) syntax inherited from the Datapoint 2200 design. This original syntax was later transformed into a new, somewhat more traditional, assembly language form for this same original 8008 chip. At about the same time, the new assembly language was also extended to accommodate the added addressing possibilities in the more advanced Intel 8080 chip (the 8008 and 8080 shared a language subset without being [[binary compatible]]; however, the 8008 was binary compatible with the Datapoint 2200).\n\nIn this process, the mnemonic <code>L</code>, for ''LOAD'', was replaced by various abbreviations of the words ''LOAD'', ''STORE'' and ''MOVE'', intermixed with other symbolic letters. The mnemonic letter <code>M</code>, for ''memory'' (referenced by HL), was lifted out from within the instruction mnemonic to become a syntactically freestanding ''operand'', while registers and combinations of registers became very inconsistently denoted; either by abbreviated operands (MVI D, LXI H and so on), within the instruction mnemonic itself (LDA, LHLD and so on), or both at the same time (LDAX B, STAX D and so on).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This is possible because the operands themselves carry enough information.\n\nThese principles made it straightforward to find names and forms for all new Z80 instructions, as well as [[orthogonalization]]s of old ones, such as <code>LD BC,(1234)</code>.\n\nApart from naming differences, and despite a certain discrepancy in basic register structure, the Z80 and [[Intel 8086|8086]] syntax are virtually [[isomorphic]] for a large portion of instructions. Only quite superficial similarities (such as the word MOV, or the letter X, for extended register) exist between the 8080 and 8086 assembly languages, although 8080 programs can be translated to 8086 assembly language by [[Assembly language translator|translator program]]s.<ref name=\"Scanlon_1988\"/><ref name=\"Nelson_1988\"/>\n\n===Instruction set and encoding===\nThe Z80 uses 252 out of the available 256 codes as single byte opcodes (\"root instruction\"); the four remaining codes are used extensively as [[opcode prefix]]es:<ref name=\"instructions\">{{cite web | url = http://www.z80.info/z80brief.htm | title = Z80 CPU Introduction | publisher = Zilog | date = 1995 | quote = It has a language of 252 root instructions and with the reserved 4 bytes as prefixes, accesses an additional 308 instructions. }}</ref> CB and ED enable extra instructions and DD or FD selects IX+d or IY+d respectively (in some cases without displacement d) in place of HL.

The Zilog documentation further groups instructions into the following categories:\n* 8-bit arithmetic and logic operations\n* 16-bit arithmetic\n* 8-bit load\n* 16-bit load\n* Bit set, reset, and test\n* Call, return, and restart\n* Exchange, block transfer, and search\n* General purpose arithmetic and CPU control\n* Input and output\n* Jump\n* Rotate and shift\n\nNo multiply instructions are available in the original Z80.<ref>{{cite book |title=Software Solutions for Engineers And Scientists |last=Sanchez |first=Julio |last2=Canton |first2=Maria P. |publisher=Taylor & Francis |date=2008 |page=65 |isbn=978-1-4200-4302-0 |quote=The 8-bit microprocessors that preceded the 80x86 family (such as the Intel 8080, the Zilog Z80, and the Motorola) did not include multiplication.}}</ref> Different sizes and variants of additions, shifts, and rotates have somewhat differing effects on flags because most of the flag-changing properties of the 8080 were copied. However, the parity flag bit P of the 8080 (bit 2) is called P/V (parity/overflow) in the Z80 as it serves the additional purpose of a twos complement overflow indicator, a lacking feature in the 8080. Arithmetic instructions on the Z80 set it to indicate overflow rather than parity, while bitwise instructions still use it as a parity flag. This new overflow flag is used for all new Z80-specific 16-bit operations ({{code|ADC}}, {{code|SBC}}) as well as for 8-bit arithmetic operations, although the 16-bit operations inherited from the 8080 ({{code|ADD}}, {{code|INC}}, {{code|DEC}}) do not affect it. Also, bit 1 of the flags register (a spare bit on the 8080) is used as a flag, N, that indicates whether the last arithmetic instruction executed was a subtraction or addition. The Z80 version of the {{code|DAA}} instruction (Decimal Adjust Accumulator for [[Binary-coded decimal|BCD]] arithmetic) checks the N flag and behaves accordingly, so a (hypothetical) subtraction followed later by {{code|DAA}} will yield a different result on an old 8080 than on the Z80. However, this would likely be erroneous code on the 8080, as {{code|DAA}} was defined for addition only on that processor.\n\nThe Z80 has six new {{code|LD}} instructions that can load the DE, BC, and SP register pairs from memory, and load memory from these three register pairs\u2014unlike the 8080.<ref>{{cite web|title=8080/Z80 Instruction Sets|url=http://nemesis.lonestar.org/computers/tandy/software/apps/m4/qd/opcodes.html|website=Quick and Dirty 8080 Assembler|publisher=Frank Durda|accessdate=2016-07-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211094642/http://nemesis.lonestar.org/computers/tandy/software/apps/m4/qd/opcodes.html|archive-date=2016-02-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> As on the 8080, load instructions do not affect the flags (except for the special purpose I and R register loads). A result of a regular encoding (common with the 8080) is that each of the 8-bit registers can be loaded from themselves (e.g. {{code|LD A,A}}). This is effectively a {{code|NOP}}.\n\nNew block transfer instructions can move up to 64 kilobytes from memory to memory or between memory and I/O peripheral ports. Block instructions {{code|LDIR}} and {{code|LDDR}} (LoaD,Increment/Decrement,Repeat) use HL to point to the source address, DE to the destination address, and BC as a byte counter. Bytes are copied from source to destination, the pointers are incremented or decremented, and the byte counter is decremented until BC reaches zero. Non-repeating versions {{code|LDI}} and {{code|LDD}} move a single byte and bump the pointers and byte counter, which if becomes zero resets the P/V flag. Corresponding memory-to-I/O instructions {{code|INIR}}, {{code|INDR}}, {{code|OTIR}}, {{code|OTDR}}, {{code|INI}}, {{code|IND}}, {{code|OUTI}} and {{code|OUTD}} operate similarly. The Z80 can input and output any register to an I/O port using register C to designate the port (the 8080 only performs I/O through the accumulator A).\n\nThe last group of block instructions perform a {{code|CP}} compare operation between the byte at (HL) and the accumulator A. Register pair DE is not used. The repeating versions {{code|CPIR}} and {{code|CPDR}} only terminate if BC goes to zero or a match is found. HL is left pointing to the byte after ({{code|CPIR}}) or before ({{code|CPDR}}) the matching byte. If no match is found the Z flag is reset. There are non-repeating versions {{code|CPI}} and {{code|CPD}}.\n\nUnlike the 8080, the Z80 can jump to a relative address ({{code|JR}} instead of {{code|JP}}) using a signed 8-bit displacement. Only the Zero and Carry flags can be tested for these new two-byte {{code|JR}} instructions. A two-byte instruction specialized for program looping is also new to the Z80. {{code|DJNZ}} (Decrement Jump if Non-Zero) takes a signed 8-bit displacement as an immediate operand. The B register is decremented. If the result is nonzero then program execution jumps relative to the address of the PC plus the displacement. The flags remain unaltered. To perform an equivalent loop on an 8080 would require separate decrement and jump (to a two-byte absolute address) instructions, and the flag register would be altered.\n\nThe index register (IX/IY, often abbreviated XY) instructions can be useful for accessing data organised in fixed heterogenous structures (such as [[record (computer science)|record]]s) or at fixed offsets relative a variable base address (as in [[recursive]] [[stack frame]]s) and can also reduce code size by removing the need for multiple short instructions using non-indexed registers. However, although they may save speed in some contexts when compared to long/complex \"equivalent\" sequences of simpler operations, they incur a lot of additional CPU time (''e.g.'' 19 T-states to access one indexed memory location ''vs.'' as little as 11 to access the same memory using HL and {{code|INC}} to point to the next). Thus, for simple or linear accesses of data, use of IX and IY tend to be slower and occupy more memory. Still, they may be useful in cases where the 'main' registers are all occupied, by removing the need to save/restore registers. Their officially undocumented 8-bit halves (see below) can be especially useful in this context, for they incur less slowdown than their 16-bit parents. Similarly, instructions for 16-bit additions are not particularly fast (11 clocks) in the original Z80; nonetheless, they are about twice as fast as performing the same calculations using 8-bit operations, and equally important, they reduce register usage. It was not uncommon for programmers to \"poke\" different (typically calculated dynamically) offset displacement bytes into indexed instructions; this is an example of [[self-modifying code]] which was regular practice on nearly all early 8-bit processors with non-[[Instruction pipelining#Special situations|pipelined]] execution units.\n\nThe index registers have a parallel instruction to {{code|JP (HL)}}, which is {{code|JP (XY)}}. This is often seen in stack-oriented languages like [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] which at the end of every Forth word (atomic subroutines comprising the language) must jump unconditionally back to their thread interpreter routines. Typically this jump instruction appears many hundreds of times in an application, and using {{code|JP (XY)}} rather than {{code|JP THREAD}} saves a byte and two t-states each occurrence. This naturally makes the index register unavailable for any other use, or else the need to constantly reload it would negate its efficiency.\n\nThe 10-year-newer microcoded [[Z180]] design could initially afford more \"chip area\", permitting a slightly more efficient implementation (using a wider [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]], among other things); similar things can be said for the [[Zilog Z800|Z800]], [[Z280]], and [[Z380]]. However, it was not until the fully pipelined [[Zilog eZ80|eZ80]] was launched in 2001 that those instructions finally became approximately as cycle-efficient as it is technically possible to make them, i.e. given the Z80 encodings combined with the capability to do an 8-bit read or write every clock cycle.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n====Undocumented instructions====\nThe index registers, IX and IY, were intended as flexible 16 bit pointers, enhancing the ability to manipulate memory, stack frames and data structures. Officially, they were treated as 16-bit only. In reality they were implemented as a pair of 8-bit registers,<ref>{{cite book | title = The free software catalog and directory | last = Froehlich | first = Robert A. | publisher = Crown Publishers | date = 1984| isbn=978-0-517-55448-7 | page = 133 | quote = Undocumented Z80 codes allow 8 bit operations with IX and IY registers. }}</ref> in the same fashion as the HL register, which is accessible either as 16 bits or separately as the ''H''igh and ''L''ow registers.

For example, the opcode 26h followed by an immediate byte value {{code|(LD H,n)}} will load that value into the H register. Preceding this two-byte instruction with the IX register's opcode prefix, DD, would instead result in the most significant 8 bits of the IX register being loaded with that same value. A notable exception to this would be instructions similar to {{code|LD H,(IX+d)}} which make use of both the HL and IX or IY registers in the same instruction;<ref name=\"undocz80\" /> in this case the DD prefix is only applied to the (IX+d) portion of the instruction. The halves of the XY registers could also hold operands for 8-bit arithmetic, logical and compare instructions, sparing the regular 8-bit registers for other use. The undocumented ability to increment and decrement the upper half of an index register made it easy to expand the range of the normal indexed instructions, without having to resort to the legal {{code|ADD/SBC XY,DE}} or {{code|ADD/SBC XY,BC}}. \n\nThere are several other undocumented instructions as well.<ref>Robin Nixon ''The Amstrad Notepad Advanced User Guide'' ,Robin Nixon, 1993 {{ISBN|1-85058-515-6}}, pages 219-223</ref> Undocumented or [[illegal opcode]]s are not detected by the Z80 and have various effects, some of which are useful. However, as they are not part of the formal definition of the instruction set, different implementations of the Z80 are not guaranteed to work the same way for every undocumented opcode.\n\n====Bugs====\nThe {{code|OTDR}} instruction does not conform to the Z80 documentation. Both the {{code|OTDR}} and {{code|OTIR}} instructions are supposed to leave the carry (C) flag unmodified. The {{code|OTIR}} instruction operates correctly; however, during the execution of the {{code|OTDR}} instruction, the carry flag takes the results of a spurious compare between the accumulator (A) and the last output of the {{code|OTDR}} instruction.\n\n===Example code===\nThe following Z80 [[assembly language|assembly]] source code is for a subroutine named <code>memcpy</code> that copies a block of data bytes of a given size from one location to another. Important: the example code does not handle a certain case where the destination block overlaps the source; a fatal bug. The sample code is extremely inefficient, intended to illustrate various instruction types, rather than best practices for speed. In particular, the Z80 has a single instruction that will execute the entire loop (<code>LDIR</code>). The data block is copied one byte at a time, and the data movement and looping logic utilizes 16-bit operations. Note that the assembled code is binary-compatible with the [[Intel 8080]] and [[Intel 8085|8085]] CPUs.\n\n<!--Note: This is not intended to be optimized code, but to illustrate the variety of instructions available on the CPU-->\n{|\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|<source lang=\"text\" highlight=\"13\">\n 1000            \n 1000            \n 1000 78         \n 1001 B1         \n 1002 C8         \n 1003 1A         \n 1004 77         \n 1005 13         \n 1006 23         \n 1007 0B         \n 1008 C3 00 10   \n 100B            \n</source>\n|<source lang=\"nasm\" highlight=\"13\">\n ; memcpy --\n ; Copy a block of memory from one location to another.\n ;\n ; Entry registers\n ;      BC - Number of bytes to copy\n ;      DE - Address of source data block\n ;      HL - Address of target data block\n ;\n ; Return registers\n ;      BC - Zero\n\n             org     1000h       ;Origin at 1000h\n memcpy      public\n loop        ld      a,b         ;Test BC,\n             or      c           ;If BC = 0,\n             ret     z           ;Return\n             ld      a,(de)      ;Load A from (DE)\n             ld      (hl),a      ;Store A into (HL)\n             inc     de          ;Increment DE\n             inc     hl          ;Increment HL\n             dec     bc          ;Decrement BC\n             jp      loop        ;Repeat the loop\n             end\n</source>\n|}\n\n===Instruction execution===\nEach instruction is executed in steps that are usually termed [[machine cycle]]s (M-cycles), each of which can take between three and six clock periods (T-cycles).<ref>{{cite book | title = Z80 Family CPU User Manual | author = Zilog | publisher = Zilog | date = 2005 | page = 11  |url=http://www.zilog.com/docs/z80/um0080.pdf }}</ref> Each M-cycle corresponds roughly to one memory access or internal operation.

This avoids cumbersome asynchronous logic and makes the control signals behave consistently at a wide range of clock frequencies. It also means that a higher frequency crystal must be used than without this subdivision of machine cycles (approximately 2\u20133 times higher). It does not imply tighter requirements on [[memory access time]]s, since a high resolution clock allows more precise control of memory timings and so memory can be active in parallel with the CPU to a greater extent, allowing more efficient use of available memory bandwidth.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOne central example of this is that, for [[opcode fetch]], the Z80 combines two full clock cycles into a memory access period (the M1-signal). In the Z80 this signal lasts for a relatively larger part of the typical instruction execution time than in a design such as the [[Motorola 6800|6800]], 6502, or similar, where this period would typically last typically 30-40% of a clock cycle.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} With memory chip affordability (i.e. access times around 450-250&nbsp;ns in the 1980s{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}) typically determining the fastest possible access time, this meant that such designs were locked to a significantly longer clock cycle (i.e. lower internal clock speed) than the Z80.\n\nMemory was generally slow compared to the state machine sub-cycles (clock cycles) used in contemporary microprocessors. The shortest machine cycle that could safely be used in embedded designs has therefore often been limited by memory access times, not by the maximum CPU frequency (especially so during the home computer era). However, this relation has slowly changed during the last decades, particularly regarding [[Static random access memory|SRAM]]; cacheless, single-cycle designs such as the [[Zilog eZ80|eZ80]] have therefore become much more meaningful recently.\n\nThe content of the refresh register R is sent out on the lower half of the address bus along with a refresh control signal while the CPU is decoding and executing the fetched instruction. During refresh the contents of the Interrupt register I are sent out on the upper half of the address bus.<ref>{{cite web|title=Z80 User Manual, Special Registers pg. 3|url=http://www.zilog.com/force_download.php?filepath=YUhSMGNEb3ZMM2QzZHk1NmFXeHZaeTVqYjIwdlpHOWpjeTk2T0RBdlZVMHdNRGd3TG5Ca1pnPT0=|website=www.zilog.com|publisher=Zilog|accessdate=2016-06-14}}</ref>\n\n===Compatible peripherals===\nZilog introduced a number of peripheral parts for the Z80, which all support the Z80's interrupt handling system and I/O address space.

While some Z80-based computers such as the [[Osborne 1]] used \"Motorola-style\" [[Memory-mapped I/O|memory mapped input/output]] devices, usually the I/O space was used to address one of the many Zilog peripheral chips compatible with the Z80. Zilog I/O chips supported the Z80's new mode 2 interrupts which simplified interrupt handling for large numbers of peripherals.\n\nThe Z80 was officially described as supporting 16-bit (64&nbsp;KB) memory addressing, and 8-bit (256 ports) I/O-addressing. All I/O instructions actually assert the entire 16-bit address bus. OUT (C),reg and IN reg,(C) places the contents of the entire 16 bit BC register on the address bus;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://z80.info/z80undoc3.txt | title = Z80 Undocumented Features (in software behaviour) | last = Young | first = Sean | date = 1998 | quote = The I/O instructions use the whole of the address bus, not just the lower 8 bits.

A designer could choose to decode the entire 16 bit address bus on I/O operations in order to take advantage of this feature, or use the high half of the address bus to select subfeatures of the I/O device. This feature has also been used to minimise decoding hardware requirements, such as in the [[Amstrad CPC]]/[[Amstrad PCW|PCW]] and [[ZX81]].\n\n==Second sources and derivatives==\n\n===Second sources===\n[[Mostek]], who produced the first Z80 for Zilog, offered it as second-source as MK3880.

Currently, it is still manufactured and sold by Flite Electronics International Limited in [[Southampton, England]].\n\n===Portable and handheld computers===\nUse of the Z80 in lighter, battery-operated devices became more widespread with the availability of CMOS versions of the processor.

[[Laptop]]s which could run the CP/M operating system just like the desktop machines followed with [[Epson PX-8 Geneva]] in 1984, and in 1985 the [[Epson PX-4]] and [[Bondwell-2]]. While the laptop market in subsequent years moved to more powerful [[Intel 8086]] processors and the MS-DOS operating system, light-weight Z80-based systems with a longer battery life were still being introduced, such as the [[Cambridge Z88]] in 1988 and the [[Amstrad NC100]] in 1992. The Z80-derived [[Zilog Z180|Z8S180]] also found its way into an early [[pen computing|pen-operated]] [[personal digital assistant]], the [[PenPad#PDA600|Amstrad PenPad PDA600]] in 1993.
