Calloway, who the prosecution argued was trying to commit [[suicide attempt|suicide]]. Calloway, a [[FedEx Express|Federal Express]] employee, was facing possible dismissal for lying about his flight hours. He boarded the scheduled flight as a [[Dead mileage|deadhead]] passenger carrying a guitar case concealing several hammers and a [[speargun]]. He intended to switch off the aircraft's [[cockpit voice recorder]] before [[takeoff]] and, once airborne, kill the crew with hammers so their injuries would appear consistent with an accident rather than a hijacking. However, the CVR was switched back on by the flight engineer, believing that he had neglected to turn it on.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nCalloway intended to use the speargun as a last resort. He planned to crash the aircraft hoping that he would appear to be an employee killed in an accident. He sought to let his family collect on a $2.5 million [[life insurance]] policy provided by Federal Express.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> Calloway's efforts to kill the crew were unsuccessful. Despite severe injuries, the crew fought back, subdued Calloway, and landed the aircraft safely.\n\nDuring his trial, Calloway claimed that he had been mentally ill, but was unsuccessful. He was convicted of multiple charges, including attempted murder, attempted [[Aircraft hijacking|air piracy]], and interference with flight crew operations. He received two consecutive life sentences. Calloway successfully appealed the conviction for interference, which was ruled to be a lesser offense of attempted air piracy.<ref name=\"USA v C\">{{cite web |title=U.S. v.

During the standard pre-flight checks, flight engineer Peterson noticed the pulled breaker and reset it before takeoff so the CVR was reactivated.

All three members of the crew received multiple hammer blows. Both Peterson and first officer Tucker suffered fractured skulls, and Peterson's [[Superficial temporal artery|temporal artery]] was severed.<ref name=\"USA v C\"/> The blow to Tucker's head initially rendered him unable to move or react but he was still conscious. Captain Sanders reported that during the beginning of the attack, he could not discern any emotion from Calloway, just \"simply a face in his eyes\".<ref name=\"Mayday\"/>\n\nWhen Calloway ceased his hammer attack, Peterson and Sanders began to get out of their seats to counter-attack. Calloway left the cockpit and retrieved his spear gun. He came back into the cockpit and threatened everyone to sit back down in their seats. Despite loud ringing in his ear and being dazed, Peterson grabbed the gun by the spear between the barbs and the barrel. A lengthy struggle ensued, while Tucker, also an ex-[[United States Naval Aviator|Navy pilot]], performed extreme aerial maneuvers with the aircraft.<ref name=\"Remembering 705\">{{cite web |url=http://aenlogistics.com/general-interest/remembering-fedex-flight-705/ |title=Remembering FedEx Flight 705 That Flew Upside Down |date=August 19, 2015 |accessdate=October 12, 2018}}</ref> He pulled the plane into a sudden 15-degree climb, throwing Sanders, Peterson and Calloway out of the cockpit and into the galley. To try to throw Calloway off balance, Tucker then turned the plane into a left roll, almost on its side. This rolled the combatants along the smoke curtain onto the left side of the galley.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nEventually, Tucker had rolled the plane almost upside down at 140 degrees, while attempting to maintain a visual reference of the environment around him through the windows. Peterson, Sanders and Calloway were then pinned to the ceiling of the plane. Calloway managed to reach his hammer hand free and hit Sanders in the head again. Just then, Tucker put the plane into a steep dive.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/><ref name=\"Remembering 705\"/> This pushed the combatants back to the seat curtain, but the wings and elevators started to flutter. At this point Tucker could hear the wind rushing against the cockpit windows. At {{convert|460|kn}}, the plane's elevators fluttered so much that the control surfaces became unresponsive due to the disrupted airflow. This tested the aircraft\u2019s safety limits. Tucker realized this was because the throttles were at full power. Releasing his only usable hand to pull back the throttles to idle, he managed to pull the plane out of the dive while it slowed down.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/><ref name=\"Remembering 705\"/>\n\nCalloway managed to hit Sanders again while the struggle continued. Sanders was losing strength and Peterson was heavily bleeding from a ruptured artery. In spite of his diminishing strength, Sanders managed to grab the hammer out of Calloway's hand and attacked him with it. When the plane was completely level, Tucker reported to Memphis Center, informed them about the attack and requested a vector back to Memphis.<ref name=\"Remembering 705\"/> He requested an ambulance and \"armed intervention\", meaning he wanted [[SWAT]] to storm the plane.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe flight crew eventually succeeded in restraining Calloway, although only after moments of inverted and near-[[transonic]] flight beyond the designed capabilities of a DC-10. Sanders took control and Tucker, who had by then lost use of the right side of his body, went back to assist Peterson in restraining Calloway. Sanders communicated with [[air traffic control]], preparing for an emergency landing back at [[Memphis International Airport]]. Meanwhile, after screaming that he could not breathe, Calloway started fighting with the crew again.<ref name=\"Remembering 705\"/>\n\nHeavily loaded with fuel and cargo, the plane was approaching too fast and too high to land on the scheduled runway 9. A fully loaded airliner could break up upon landing at these conditions. Sanders requested by radio to land on the longer runway 36L.<ref name=\"Remembering 705\"/> Ignoring warning messages from the onboard computer and using a series of sharp turns that tested the DC-10's safety limits, Sanders landed the jet safely on the runway at {{convert|16000|kg|ST}} over its maximum designed landing weight.<ref name=\"Mayday\"/> By that time, Calloway was once again restrained. Emergency personnel and police gained access to the plane via escape slide and ladder. Inside, they found the interior of the galley and cockpit covered in blood.<ref name=\"tailstrike\"/> Calloway was then arrested and taken off the plane.<ref name=\"Remembering 705\"/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe crew of Flight 705 sustained serious injuries.<ref name=\"USA v C\"/> The left side of Tucker's skull was severely fractured, causing [[motor control]] problems in his right arm and right leg.
