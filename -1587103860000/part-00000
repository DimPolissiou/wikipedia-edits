Planned as [[Operation Wilfred]] and [[Plan R 4]], while the German attack was feared but had not happened, {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}} set out from [[Scapa Flow]] for the [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjorden]] with twelve destroyers on April 4. British and German naval forces met at the [[Battles of Narvik]] on 9 and 10 April, and the first British forces [[\u00c5ndalsnes landings|landed at \u00c5ndalsnes]] on 13 April. Thus, the Allied movements could be presented as an attempt to prevent the Germans from capturing northern Norway.  \n\nThe Allied campaign continued until June 10, 1940 and did not succeed, but it resulted in the successful escape of King [[Haakon VII]] and his family to [[Great Britain]].\n\nA British and French expeditionary force of some 38,000 men continued to land in northern Norway. It had moderate success, but what led it to withdraw in June was Germany's [[Battle of France|invasion of France]] in May. The Norwegian government then sought [[Government in exile|exile]] in London. The Allied campaign ended with the occupation of the whole of Norway by Germany, but [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile|exiled Norwegian forces]] escaped and fought on from overseas. \n\nThe 62 days of fighting after April 9 made Norway the nation that withstood a German land invasion for the second longest period of time, after the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Outbreak of the Second World War===\nBritain and France had signed military assistance treaties with [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and two days after the German [[Invasion of Poland]] (on 1 September 1939), both declared war against [[Nazi Germany]]. However, neither country mounted significant offensive operations and for several months no major engagements occurred in what became known as the [[Phoney War]] or \"Twilight War\". [[Winston Churchill]] in particular wished to move the war into a more active phase, in contrast to Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]].<ref name=lunde3>Lunde 2009, p. 3</ref>\n\nDuring this time both sides wished to open secondary fronts. For the Allies, in particular the French, this was based on a desire to avoid repeating the [[trench warfare]] of the [[First World War]], which had occurred along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Franco-German border]].<ref name=lunde3/>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, the Norwegian government had mobilized parts of the [[Norwegian Army]] and all but two of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]]'s warships. The [[Norwegian Army Air Service]] and the [[Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service]] were also called up to protect Norwegian neutrality from violations by the warring countries. The first such violations were the sinkings in Norwegian territorial waters of several British ships by German [[U-boat]]s. In the following months aircraft from all the belligerents violated Norwegian neutrality.<ref name=vakt>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Lars |last=Borgersrud |authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=n\u00f8ytralitetsvakt|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate=|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=313 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nAlmost immediately after the outbreak of war, the British began pressuring the Norwegian government to provide the United Kingdom with the services of the Norwegian merchant navy, themselves being in dire need of shipping in order to oppose the strength of Nazi forces. Following protracted negotiations between 25 September and 20 November 1939, the Norwegians agreed to charter 150 [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]], as well as other ships with a tonnage of 450,000 gross tons.

When ''Altmark'' began the return journey to Germany she carried 299 prisoners taken from the Allied ships sunk by ''Admiral Graf Spee''.<ref name=altmark/> ''Altmark'' entered Norwegian territorial waters near the [[Trondheimsfjord]], flying the Imperial Service Flag (''Reichsdienstflagge''). A Norwegian naval escort was provided as ''Altmark'' proceeded southwards, hugging the Norwegian coastline. As ''Altmark'' was nearing Bergen harbour on 14 February, the Norwegian naval authorities demanded to inspect the German ship. Even though international law did not ban the transfer of prisoners of war through neutral waters, the German captain refused the inspection. This led the naval commander in Bergen, Admiral [[Carsten Tank-Nielsen]], to deny ''Altmark'' access to the restricted-access war harbour. Tank-Nielsen was however overruled by his superior, Commanding Admiral [[Henry Diesen]], and ''Altmark'' was escorted through the harbour. According to Norwegian neutrality regulations, government ships operated by the warring countries were not allowed to enter a number of strategically important Norwegian ports. This violation of the regulations was allowed because Admiral Diesen feared that the British would intercept ''Altmark'' if she was forced to sail closer to the edge of Norwegian territorial waters.<ref name=altmark/>\n\nOn 16 February, ''Altmark'' was spotted by three British aircraft. The discovery of the ship's location led the Royal Navy to send one light cruiser and five destroyers patrolling nearby to the area. Under the attack of two British destroyers (HMS [[HMS Ivanhoe (D16)|''Ivanhoe'']] and [[HMS Intrepid (D10)|''Intrepid'']]), ''Altmark'' fled into the J\u00f8ssingfjord. At the time ''Altmark'' was escorted by the Norwegian torpedo boat {{HNoMS|Skarv|1906|2}}. She was joined later in the fjord by the torpedo boat {{HNoMS|Kjell||2}} and the patrol boat ''Firern''. As ''Cossack'' entered the fjord at 22:20 local time, the Norwegian vessels did not intervene when the British boarded ''Altmark'' in the late hours of 16 February. The boarding action led to the freeing of 299 Allied prisoners of war held on the German ship. The boarding party killed seven Germans in the process.<ref name=altmark/>\n\nFollowing the incident, the Germans sent strong protests to the Norwegian government. The Norwegians also sent protests to the British government. While Norwegian, Swedish and American experts in international law described the British action as a violation of Norwegian neutrality, the United Kingdom declared that the incident was at the most a technical violation that had been morally justified.<ref name=altmark/>\n\nThe ''Altmark'' incident led to the Germans speeding up their planning for an invasion of Norway. On 21 February, General [[Nikolaus von Falkenhorst]] was placed in charge of planning the invasion and in command of the land-based forces. The official approval for the invasion and occupation of [[Denmark]] and Norway was signed by Hitler on 1 March.<ref name=grove/><ref name=krono/><ref name=altmark/>\n\n==Initial plans==\n\n===Allied plans===\nWith the end of the [[Winter War]], the Allies determined that any occupation of Norway or Sweden would likely do more harm than good, possibly driving the neutral countries into an alliance with Germany. However, the new French prime minister, [[Paul Reynaud]], took a more aggressive stance than his predecessor and wanted some form of action taken against Germany.<ref name=planer/> Churchill was a strong agitator for action in Scandinavia, because he wanted to cut Germany off from Sweden and push the Scandinavian countries to side with the United Kingdom. This initially involved a 1939 plan to penetrate the Baltic with a naval force. This was soon changed to a plan involving the mining of Norwegian waters to stop iron ore shipments from Narvik and provoke Germany into attacking Norway, where it could be defeated by the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Lunde 2009, pp. 11\u201314</ref>\n\nIt was agreed to utilize Churchill's naval mining plan, [[Operation Wilfred]], designed to remove the sanctuary of the Leads and force transport ships into international waters where the Royal Navy could engage and destroy them. Accompanying this would be [[Plan R 4]], an operation where, upon almost certain German counteraction to Operation Wilfred, the Allies would then proceed to occupy Narvik, Trondheim, Bergen, and [[Stavanger]]. The planners hoped that the operation would not provoke the Norwegians to resist the Allies with armed force.<ref>Lunde 2009, p. 34</ref>\n\nThe Allies disagreed over the additional [[Operation Royal Marine]], where mines would also be placed in the [[Rhine River]]. While the British supported this operation, the French were against it, since they also depended on the Rhine and feared German reprisals on French soil. Because of this delay, Operation Wilfred, originally scheduled for 5 April, was delayed until 8 April when the British agreed to perform the Norwegian operations separately from those on the continent.<ref name=planer/>\n\n===German plans===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2006-0529-501, Nikolaus v.

It was to be presented as an armed protection of Norway's neutrality.\n\nOne subject debated by German strategists was the occupation of Denmark. Denmark was considered vital because its location facilitated greater air and naval control of the area. While some wanted to simply pressure Denmark to acquiesce, it was eventually determined that it would be safer for the operation if Denmark were captured by force.\n\nAnother matter that caused additional reworking of the plan was ''Fall Gelb'', the proposed invasion of northern France and the [[Low Countries]], which would require the bulk of German forces. Because some forces were needed for both invasions, ''Weser\u00fcbung'' could not occur at the same time as Gelb, and because the nights were shortening as spring approached, which were vital cover for the naval forces, it therefore had to be sooner. Eventually, on 2 April, the Germans set 9 April as the day of the invasion (''Wesertag''), and 04:15 (Norwegian time) as the hour of the landings (''Weserzeit'').<ref name=krono/>\n\nIn Norway, the German plan called for the capture of six primary targets by [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] landings: [[Oslo]], [[Kristiansand]], [[Egersund]], Bergen, Trondheim and Narvik. Additionally, supporting ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (paratroops) were to capture other key locations such as airfields at [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu|Fornebu]] outside of Oslo and Sola outside of Stavanger.

''Renown''{{'}}s force was soon caught in a heavy snowstorm, and {{HMS|Glowworm|H92|6}}, one of the destroyer escorts, had to drop out of formation to search for a man swept overboard. The weather aided the Germans, providing a screen for their forces, and in the early morning they sent out ''Gruppe 1'' and ''Gruppe 2'', who had the largest distance to travel.\n\nAlthough the weather did make reconnaissance difficult, the two German groups were discovered {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Lindesnes|the Naze]] (the southernmost part of Norway) slightly after 08:00 by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) patrols and reported as one cruiser and six destroyers.

During the fight ''Glowworm'' had broken radio silence and informed the Admiralty of her situation. She was not able to complete her transmission though, and all the Admiralty knew was that ''Glowworm'' had been confronted by a large German ship, shots were fired, and contact with the destroyer could not be re-established. In response, the Admiralty ordered ''Renown'' and her single destroyer escort (the other two had gone to friendly ports for fuel), to abandon her post at the Vestfjord and head to ''Glowworm''{{'}}s last known location. At 10:45, the remaining eight destroyers of the minelaying force were ordered to join them as well.\n\nOn the morning of 8 April, the Polish submarine {{ORP|Orze\u0142|1938|6}} confronted and sank the clandestine German troop transport ship {{MS|Rio de Janeiro|1914|2}} off the southern Norwegian port of [[Lillesand]].<ref name=rio>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Fran\u00e7ois|last=Kersaudy|authorlink=Fran\u00e7ois Kersaudy|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=Rio de Janeiro|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate=|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=357|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Discovered amongst the wreckage were uniformed German soldiers and various military supplies. Though ''Orze\u0142'' reported the incident to the Admiralty, they were too concerned by the situation with ''Glowworm'' and the presumed German breakout to give it much thought and did not pass the information on. Many of the German soldiers from the wreck were rescued by Norwegian fishing boats and the destroyer {{HNoMS|Odin|1939|2}}. On interrogation the survivors disclosed that they were assigned to protect Bergen from the Allies. This information was passed on to Oslo where the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian Parliament]] ignored the sinking due to being distracted by the British mining operations off the Norwegian coast.<ref name=rio/>\n\nAt 14:00, the Admiralty received word that aerial reconnaissance had located a group of German ships a considerable distance west-northwest of Trondheim, bearing west. This reinforced the notion that the Germans were indeed intending a breakout, and the Home Fleet changed direction from northeast to northwest to again try to intercept. Additionally, Churchill cancelled Plan R 4 and ordered the four cruisers carrying the soldiers and their supplies to disembark their cargo and join the Home Fleet. In fact, the German ships, ''Gruppe 2'', were only performing delaying circling manoeuvres in order to approach their destination of Trondheim at the designated time.\n\nThat night, after learning of numerous sightings of German ships south of Norway, Charles Forbes began to doubt the validity of the breakout idea, and he ordered the Home Fleet to head south to the [[Skagerrak]]. He also ordered {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}}, along with another cruiser and a few destroyers, to head north and join ''Renown''.\n\nAt 23:00, as Forbes was just learning of the incident with ''Orze\u0142'', ''Gruppe 5'' was confronted by the Norwegian patrol vessel {{HNoMS|Pol III||2}} at the entrance to the [[Oslofjord]]. ''Pol III'' quickly sent an alarm to the coastal batteries on Rau\u00f8y (Rau\u00f8y island) and opened fire on the [[German torpedo boats of World War II|torpedo boat]] {{ship|German torpedo boat|Albatros||2}} with her single gun shortly before colliding with it. ''Albatros'' and two of her companions responded with [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] fire, killing the Norwegian captain and setting ''Pol III'' on fire. ''Gruppe 5'' continued into the Oslofjord and cleared the outer batteries without incident. Several of the smaller German ships then broke off in order to capture the bypassed fortifications along with [[Horten]].\n\nThis activity did not go unnoticed, and soon reports had reached Oslo, leading to a midnight session of the [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Norwegian cabinet]]. At this meeting, the cabinet issued orders for the mobilization of four of the six field brigades of the Norwegian Army. The members of the cabinet failed to understand that the partial mobilization they had ordered would, according to the regulations in place, be carried out in secret and without public declaration. Troops would be issued their mobilization orders by post. The only member of the cabinet with in-depth knowledge of the mobilization system, defence minister [[Birger Ljungberg]], failed to explain the procedure to his colleagues. He would later be heavily criticized for this oversight, which led to unnecessary delays in the Norwegian mobilization. Prior to the cabinet meeting, Ljungberg had dismissed repeated demands for a total and immediate mobilization, made by the chief of the general staff, [[Rasmus Hatledal]]. Hatledal had approached Ljungberg on 5, 6 and 8 April, asking the defence minister to request the cabinet to issue orders for mobilization. The issue had been discussed in the evening of 8 April, after the Commanding General, [[Kristian Laake]], had joined the calls for a mobilization. At that time the mobilization had been limited to two field battalions in [[\u00d8stfold]], further delaying the larger-scale call-up of troops. When Laake's call for mobilization was finally accepted at some time between 03:30 to 04:00 on 9 April, the Commanding General assumed, like defence minister Ljungberg, that the cabinet knew that they were issuing a partial and silent mobilization. The poor communication between the Norwegian armed forces and the civilian authorities caused much confusion in the early days of the German invasion.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Lars|last=Borgersrud|authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=Ljungberg, Birger |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=250|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name=mob>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Arnfinn|last=Moland|authorlink=Arnfinn Moland|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=mobiliseringen i 1940|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=274\u2013275|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Lars|last=Borgersrud |authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=stille mobilisering|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=399\u2013400|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nAt about this time, further north, ''Renown'' was heading back to Vestfjord after reaching ''Glowworm''{{'}}s last known location and not finding anything.

''Renown'' engaged the two battleships off the [[Lofoten|Lofoten Archipelago]], and during [[Action off Lofoten|the short battle]] ''Renown'' scored several hits on the German vessels, forcing them to flee north.

With ''Renown'' and her escorts earlier diverted to investigate the ''Glowworm'' incident, no British ships stood in their way, and they entered the area unopposed. By the time they had reached the inner area near Narvik, most of the destroyers had peeled off from the main formation to capture the outer batteries of the Ofotfjord, leaving only three to contend with the two old Norwegian [[coastal defence ship]]s standing guard in Narvik harbour, {{HNoMS|Eidsvold||2}} and {{HNoMS|Norge||2}}. Although antiquated, the two coastal defence ships were quite capable of taking on the much more lightly armed and armoured destroyers. After a quick parley with the captain of ''Eidsvold'', [[Odd Isaachsen Willoch]], the German ships opened fire pre-emptively on the coastal defence ship, sinking her after hitting her with three torpedoes. ''Norge'' entered into the fray shortly after and began to fire on the destroyers, but her marksmen were inexperienced and she did not hit the Germans ships before being sunk by a salvo of torpedoes from the German destroyers.\n\nFollowing the sinking of ''Eidsvold'' and ''Norge'', the commander of Narvik, [[Konrad Sundlo]], surrendered the land forces in the town without a fight.<ref name=narvik/>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-757-0038N-11A, Norwegen, Schwerer Kreuzer.jpg|thumb|upright|The German cruiser ''Admiral Hipper'' landing troops in Trondheim]]\nAt Trondheim, ''Gruppe 2'' also faced only minor resistance to their landings. In the [[Trondheimsfjord]], ''Admiral Hipper'' engaged the defensive batteries while her destroyers sped past them at {{convert|25|kn|km/h}}. A well placed shot by ''Admiral Hipper'' severed the power cables for the searchlights and rendered the guns ineffective. Only one destroyer received a hit during the landing.\n[[File:German cruiser Bl\u00fccher sinking.jpg|thumb|The German cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Bl\u00fccher||2}} sinking in the [[Oslofjord]]]]\nAt Bergen, the defensive fortifications put up stiffer resistance to ''Gruppe 3''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s approach and the light cruiser ''K\u00f6nigsberg'' and the artillery training ship ''Bremse'' were damaged, the former seriously. The lack of working lights reduced the effectiveness of the guns though, and the landing ships were able to dock without much opposition. The fortifications were surrendered soon after, when Luftwaffe units arrived.\n\n[[Odder\u00f8ya#History|The fortifications]] at Kristiansand put up an even more resolute fight, twice repulsing the landing and damaging {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}}, nearly causing her to run aground. Confusion soon sprung up though, when the Norwegians received the order not to fire on British and French ships and the Germans began to use Norwegian codes that they had captured at Horten. The Germans also used this opportunity to quickly reach the harbour and unload their troops, capturing the town by 11:00.\n\nWhile most of ''Gruppe 4'' was engaged at Kristiansand, the torpedo boat {{ship|German torpedo boat|Greif||2}} [[Capture of Arendal|captured Arendal]] without any opposition.

She carried much of the administrative personnel intended both for the occupation of Norway and also for the headquarters of the army division assigned to seize Oslo. The cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, also damaged in the attack and believing ''Bl\u00fccher'' had entered a minefield, withdrew with ''Gruppe 5'', 19&nbsp;km (12&nbsp;mi) south to [[Son, Norway|Sonsbukten]] where she unloaded her troops. This distance delayed the arrival of the main German invasion force for Oslo by over 24 hours, though the Norwegian capital would still be captured less than 12 hours after the loss of ''Bl\u00fccher'' by troops flown into [[Fornebu Airport]] near the city.<ref name=blucher/>\n[[File:German soldiers in Oslo 9 April 1940.jpg|thumb|left|German soldiers marching through Oslo on the first day of the invasion]]\nThe delay induced by the Norwegian forces gave time for the royal family, Parliament, [[Flight of the Norwegian National Treasury|and with them the national treasury]], to flee the capital and continue the fighting against the invasion force.<ref name=grove/><ref name=blucher/>\n\nFornebu Airport was originally supposed to be secured by paratroops an hour before the first troops were flown in, but the initial force became lost in the fog and did not arrive.

The Norwegian Army Air Service's [[Jagevingen]] fighter flight based on Fornebu Airport resisted with their [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplane fighters until ammunition ran out and then flew off to whatever secondary airfields were available. The ground personnel of the Fighter Wing soon ran out of ammunition for their anti-aircraft machine guns as well; in the general confusion and focus on readying the fighters for action, no one had the presence of mind or the time to issue small-arms ammunition for the personal weapons of the ground personnel. Resistance at Fornebu Airport came to an end, with the Germans' only loss being a single Ju 52.<ref>Dildy, Doug.

In order to secure the Skagerrak strait between Norway and Denmark, the air bases in Denmark had to be seized. The domination of this strait would prevent the Royal Navy from interfering with the main supply lines of the invasion forces. In this respect, the occupation of Denmark was considered to be vital. The capture of [[Aalborg Airport]] was considered particularly important in this respect.<ref name=tyskbomb>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Lars|last=Borgersrud|authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=bombing, tysk|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=50|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nThe German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' crossed the Danish border around 05:15 on 9 April. In a coordinated operation, German troops disembarked at the docks of [[Langelinie]] in the Danish capital, [[Copenhagen]], and began occupying the city. German paratroops also captured Aalborg Airport. Simultaneously, an ultimatum was presented by the German ambassador to King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]]. The Danish army was small, ill-prepared and used obsolete equipment, but resisted in several parts of the country; most importantly, the Royal Guards located at [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen, and forces in the vicinity of [[Haderslev]] in [[South Jutland County|South Jutland]]. By 06:00, the small [[Royal Danish Air Force|Danish Air Force]] had been taken out and 28 German [[Heinkel He 111]] bombers were threatening to drop their bombs over Copenhagen. King Christian, having consulted with Prime Minister [[Thorvald Stauning]], Foreign Minister [[P. Munch]] and the commanders of the army and the navy, decided to capitulate, believing that further resistance would only result in a useless loss of Danish lives. By 08:43 Denmark had capitulated.<ref>Dildy 2007, pp. 34\u201336</ref> The Danish public was taken completely by surprise by the occupation, and was instructed by the government to cooperate with the German authorities.

Not willing to disperse too thinly due to the unknown location of the two German battleships, the Home Fleet chose to focus on nearby Bergen and dispatched an attack force. RAF reconnaissance soon reported stronger opposition than anticipated, and this, along with the possibility that the Germans might be controlling the shore defences, caused them to recall the force and instead use the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} to launch torpedo bombers at the enemy ships. The attack never commenced though, as Luftwaffe bombers launched an assault of their own against the Home Fleet first. This attack sank the destroyer {{HMS|Gurkha|F20|6}} and then forced the Home Fleet to withdraw north when their anti-aircraft measures proved ineffective. This German [[air superiority]] in the area led the British to decide that all southern regions had to be left to submarines and the RAF, while surface vessels would concentrate on the north.<ref name=grove/>\n\nIn addition to the German landings in south and central Norway, the Admiralty was also informed via press reports that a single German destroyer was in Narvik. In response to this, they ordered the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, mostly consisting of ships previously serving as escort destroyers for Operation Wilfred, to engage. This flotilla, under the command of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Bernard Warburton-Lee]], had already detached from {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} during her pursuit of {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, being ordered to guard the entrance to the Vestfjord. At 16:00 on 9 April, the flotilla sent an officer ashore at [[Tran\u00f8y]] {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Narvik and learned from the locals that the German force was 4\u20136 destroyers and a submarine. Warburton-Lee sent these findings back to the Admiralty, concluding with his intention to attack the next day at \"dawn, high water\", which would give him the element of surprise and protection against any mines. This decision was approved by the Admiralty in a telegram that night.\n\n====First Battle of Narvik====\nThough ten German destroyers had originally taken Narvik, only five remained in the harbor, with three others moving North and the remaining two going west.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_narvik_first.html|title=First battle of Narvik, 10 April 1940|publisher=|date=|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> Early the following morning, Warburton-Lee led his flagship, {{HMS|Hardy|H87|6}}, and four other destroyers into the Ofotfjord. At 04:30, he arrived at Narvik harbor and entered along with {{HMS|Hunter|H35|6}} and {{HMS|Havock|H43|6}}, leaving {{HMS|Hotspur|H01|6}} and {{HMS|Hostile|H55|6}} to guard the entrance and watch the shore batteries. The fog and snow were extremely heavy, allowing Warburton-Lee's force to approach undetected. When they arrived at the harbour itself they found five German destroyers and opened fire, starting the [[Battles of Narvik|First Battle of Narvik]]. Warburton-Lee's ships made three passes on the enemy ships, being joined after the first by ''Hotspur'' and ''Hostile'', and sank two of the destroyers, disabled one more, and sank six tankers and supply ships. The German commander, Commodore [[Friedrich Bonte]], lost his life when his flagship {{ship|German destroyer|Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp||2}} was sunk.\n\nHowever, Captain Warburton-Lee would make a fatal error when he decided to attack the German destroyers one last time. The German destroyers from the North and West converged on the British Fleet at 06:00, while the British were preparing for the final attack. ''Hardy'' was severely damaged and beached, and Warburton-Lee was killed. ''Hunter'' and ''Hotspur'' were both critically damaged, and ''Hotspur'' ran into the sinking ''Hunter''. ''Hostile'' and ''Havock'' meanwhile had raced ahead, but turned about and came back to aid the retreat of ''Hotspur''. The German destroyers were low on fuel and ammunition, allowing ''Hostile'' and ''Havock'' to come back to aid the retreat of ''Hotspur''.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MN-1038-06, Kiel, Schwerer Kreuzer \"L\u00fctzow\".jpg|thumb|{{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}} in [[Kiel]] after being torpedoed by the British submarine {{HMS|Spearfish|69S|2}} on her way back from Norway]]\n\n====Second Battle of Narvik====\nShortly after the First Battle of Narvik, two more German ships were sunk by British forces. During the night of 9/10 April, the submarine {{HMS|Truant|N68|6}} intercepted and sank the light cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}} shortly after she had left Kristiansand. On 10 April, the [[Fleet Air Arm]] made a long-range attack from their base at [[RNAS Hatston]] (also called HMS ''Sparrowhawk'') in the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]] against German warships in Bergen harbour. The attack sank the disabled German light cruiser ''K\u00f6nigsberg'';\n\nOn 10 April, ''Furious'' and the battleship {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}} joined the Home Fleet, and another air attack was made against Trondheim hoping to sink ''Admiral Hipper''. ''Admiral Hipper'', however, had already managed to escape through the watch set up outside of the port and was on her way back to Germany when the attack was launched; none of the remaining German destroyers or support ships were hit in the assault. Better luck was had in the south when {{HMS|Spearfish|69S|6}} severely damaged the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}} at midnight on 11 April, putting the German ship out of commission for a year.\n\nWith it becoming more evident the German fleet had slipped out of Norwegian waters, the Home Fleet continued north to Narvik in the hope of catching the remaining destroyers. En route the ships suffered further harassment from German bombers, forcing them to divert to the west away from the shoreline. By 12 April, they were in range of Narvik and an aerial attack on Narvik from ''Furious'' was attempted, but the results were disappointing. It was instead decided to send in the battleship ''Warspite'' and a powerful escort force, to be commanded by Whitworth.\n\n[[File:UK-NWE-Norway-2.jpg|300px|thumb|The British-German naval battles at Narvik on 10 and 13 April]]\nOn the morning of 13 April, Whitworth's force entered the Vestfjord using ''Warspite''{{'}}s scouting aircraft to guide the way. Aside from locating two of the German destroyers, the scouting aircraft also sank an enemy submarine, the first such occurrence. ''Warspite''{{'}}s destroyers travelled {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} in advance of the battleship and were the first to engage their German counterparts which had come to meet them, thus starting the [[Battles of Narvik|Second Battle of Narvik]]. Though neither side inflicted notable damage, the German ships were running low on ammunition and were gradually pushed back to the harbour. By that afternoon, most attempted to flee up the [[Rombaksfjord]], the only exception being {{ship|German destroyer|Z19 Hermann K\u00fcnne||2}} which beached herself as she made for the Herjangsfjord and was destroyed by {{HMS|Eskimo|F75|6}}. Four British destroyers continued to chase the German ships up through the Rombaksfjord, ''Eskimo'' was soon damaged by the waiting opposition. However, the German situation was hopeless, having run out of fuel and ammunition, and by the time the remaining British ships arrived, the German crews had abandoned and scuttled their ships. By 18:30 the British ships were making their way out of the now cleared fjord.\n\n==Norwegian situation==\nThe German invasions for the most part achieved their goal of simultaneous assault and caught the Norwegian forces off guard, a situation not aided by the Norwegian government's order for only a partial mobilization. Not all was lost for the Allies though, as the repulsion of the German ''Gruppe 5'' in the Oslofjord gave a few additional hours of time which the Norwegians used to evacuate the Royal family and the Norwegian Government to [[Hamar]]. With the government now fugitive, [[Vidkun Quisling]] used the opportunity to take control of a radio broadcasting station and announce a coup, with himself as the new [[Prime Minister of Norway]].

His first task was to secure the Oslofjord area, then to use the [[196th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|196th]] and [[163rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|163rd Infantry Divisions]] to establish contact with the forces at Trondheim.\n\n==Ground campaign==\nWhen the nature of the German invasion became apparent to the British military, it began to make preparations for a counter-attack. Dissension amongst the various branches was strong though, as the [[British Army]], after conferring with Otto Ruge, wanted to assault Trondheim in Central Norway while Churchill insisted on reclaiming Narvik. It was decided to send troops to both locations as a compromise. Admiral [[William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork and Orrery|Lord Cork]] was in overall command of the Allied operations.<ref>Dildy 2007, p. 17</ref>\n\n===Campaign in eastern Norway===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H26353, Norwegen, Kampf um ein brennendes Dorf.jpg|thumb|German infantry attacking through a burning Norwegian village]]\nAfter the appointment of Ruge as Commanding General on 10 April, the Norwegian strategy was to fight delaying actions against the Germans advancing northwards from Oslo to link up with the invasion forces at Trondheim. The main aim of the Norwegian effort in [[eastern Norway]] was to give the Allies enough time to recapture Trondheim, and start a counter-offensive against the German main force in the Oslo area. The region surrounding the Oslofjord was defended by the [[1st Division (Norway)|1st Division]], commanded by Major General [[Carl Johan Erichsen]]. The rest of the region was covered by the [[2nd Division (Norway)|2nd Division]], commanded by Major General [[Jacob Hvinden Haug]]. Having been prevented from mobilizing in an orderly fashion by the German invasion, improvised Norwegian units were sent into action against the Germans. Several of the units facing the German advance were led by officers especially selected by Ruge to replace commanders who had failed to show sufficient initiative and aggression in the early days of the campaign. The German offensive aimed at linking up their forces in Oslo and Trondheim began on 14 April, with an advance north from Oslo towards the [[Gudbrandsdalen]] and [[\u00d8sterdalen]] valleys. [[H\u00f8nefoss]] was the first town to fall to the advancing German forces. North of H\u00f8nefoss the Germans began meeting Norwegian resistance, first delaying actions and later units fighting organized defensive actions. During intense fighting with heavy casualties on both sides, troops of the Norwegian Infantry Regiment 6 blunted the German advance at the village of [[Haugsbygd]] on 15 April. The Germans only broke through the Norwegian lines at Haugsbygd the next day after employing panzers for the first time in Norway.

Some 2,000 soldiers marched into captivity in the Setesdal capitulation. With the abandonment on 20 April of the Franco-British plans for recapturing the central Norwegian city of Trondheim, Ruge's strategy became practically infeasible.<ref name=forsvar/><ref name=Ruge/><ref name=skodvin54>Skodvin 1991, p. 54</ref>\n\nWith the calling off of the Allied plans for recapturing Trondheim, British forces which had been [[\u00c5ndalsnes landings|landed at \u00c5ndalsnes]] moved into eastern Norway.

In the [[Battle for Kvam]] on 25 and 26 April, the British managed to delay the German advance for two days of heavy fighting.

[[Junkers Ju 87]] [[dive bomber]]s proved particularly effective in demoralizing Norwegian troops opposing the advance.

The small Norwegian infantry forces in Bergen retreated eastwards, blowing up two railway bridges and sections of road after them.

Following the German invasion General Fleischer assumed the position of commander-in-chief of all Norwegian forces in northern Norway. The Norwegian counter-offensive against the Germans at Narvik was hampered by Fleischer's decision to retain significant forces in Eastern Finnmark to guard against a possible Soviet attack in the far north.<ref name=fleischer/>\n\nAlong with the Allied landings at \u00c5ndalsnes and Namsos, aimed against Trondheim, further forces were deployed to the north of Norway and assigned the task of recapturing Narvik. Like the campaign in the south, the Narvik expedition faced numerous obstacles.\n\nOne of the first problems faced by the Allies was that the command was not unified, or even truly organized. The naval forces in the area were led by [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] [[William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork]] who had been ordered to rid the area of the Germans as soon as possible. In contrast, the commander of the ground forces, Major-General [[Pierse Joseph Mackesy|Pierse Mackesy]], was ordered not to land his forces in any area strongly held by the Germans and to avoid damaging populated areas. The two met on 15 April to determine the best course of action. Lord Cork argued for an immediate assault on Narvik and Mackesy countered that such a move would lead to heavy casualties for his attacking troops. Cork eventually conceded to Mackesy's viewpoint.\n\nMackesy's force was originally codenamed ''Avonforce'', later ''Rupertforce''.<ref>Sandvik 1965I, pp. 204\u2013206</ref><ref>Sandvik 1965II, p. 354</ref> The force consisted of the [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]], led by Brigadier [[William Fraser (British Army officer)|William Fraser]], and French and Polish units led by Brigadier [[Antoine B\u00e9thouart]].<ref name=dildy29/> The main force began landing at [[Harstad]], a port town on the island of [[Hinn\u00f8ya]], on 14 April.

In all 118 warships had been under Norwegian command at one time or another during the war years.<ref name=forsvar/><ref name=marinen/>\n\nNorwegian squadrons flew with the [[RAF Fighter Command|RAF Fighter]] and [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal]] Commands. The Norwegian-manned [[No. 331 Squadron RAF|331 Squadron]] and [[No. 332 Squadron RAF|332 Squadron]] operated Hawker Hurricane and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighter aircraft. The naval [[No. 330 Squadron RNoAF|330 Squadron]] and [[No. 333 Squadron RAF|333 Squadron]] flew [[Northrop N-3PB]] patrol bombers, [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] and [[Short Sunderland]] flying boats and [[de Havilland Mosquito]] fighter bombers. Individual Norwegians flew with British air units. In November 1944 the Royal Norwegian Naval Air Service and the Norwegian Army Air Service, having been under a unified command since March 1941, were amalgamated to form the RNoAF. At the end of the war some 2,700 personnel served in the RNoAF.<ref name=forsvar/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Lars |last=Borgersrud |authorlink=Lars Borgersrud |encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=flyv\u00e5penet |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= | year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=109\u2013111 |language=Norwegian }}</ref>\n\nA c. 4,000 strong Norwegian Army was also re-established in [[Scotland]]. However, with the exception of a small number of special forces, it saw little action for the rest of the war. A reinforced company from the Scotland-based Norwegian Army participated in the liberation of Finnmark during the winter of 1944\u201345. Finnmark and the northern parts of Troms county had been forcibly evacuated by the Germans in a scorched earth operation following the [[Petsamo\u2013Kirkenes Offensive]] by the [[Red Army]] against occupied Finnmark in October 1944. The offensive had captured the north-eastern town of [[Kirkenes]] from the occupying German forces. After the arrival of the 300 troops from Scotland, further troops were moved in from Sweden and mobilized locally. At the end of the war, the Norwegian forces in Finnmark totalled 3,000.

After the fall of Norway, Scotland (especially the fleet bases at Scapa Flow and [[Rosyth]]) were seen as much more vulnerable to a diversionary assault by air- and sea-borne troops. German commerce raiders used Norway as a staging base to reach the North Atlantic.

Planned as [[Operation Wilfred]] and [[Plan R 4]], while the German attack was feared but had not happened, {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}} set out from [[Scapa Flow]] for the [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjorden]] with twelve destroyers on April 4. British and German naval forces met at the [[Battles of Narvik]] on 9 and 10 April, and the first British forces [[\u00c5ndalsnes landings|landed at \u00c5ndalsnes]] on 13 April. Thus, the Allied movements could be presented as an attempt to prevent the Germans from capturing northern Norway.  \n\nThe Allied campaign continued until June 10, 1940 and did not succeed, but it resulted in the successful escape of King [[Haakon VII]] and his family to [[Great Britain]].\n\nA British and French expeditionary force of some 38,000 mencontinued to land in northern Norway. It had moderate success, but what led it to withdraw in June was Germany's [[Battle of France|invasion of France]] in May. The Norwegian government then sought [[Government in exile|exile]] in London. The Allied campaign ended with the occupation of the whole of Norway by Germany, but [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile|exiled Norwegian forces]] escaped and fought on from overseas. \n\nThe 62 days of fighting after April 9 made Norway the nation that withstood a German land invasion for the second longest period of time, after the [[Soviet Union]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Outbreak of the Second World War===\nBritain and France had signed military assistance treaties with [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and two days after the German [[Invasion of Poland]] (on 1 September 1939), both declared war against [[Nazi Germany]]. However, neither country mounted significant offensive operations and for several months no major engagements occurred in what became known as the [[Phoney War]] or \"Twilight War\". [[Winston Churchill]] in particular wished to move the war into a more active phase, in contrast to Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]].<ref name=lunde3>Lunde 2009, p. 3</ref>\n\nDuring this time both sides wished to open secondary fronts. For the Allies, in particular the French, this was based on a desire to avoid repeating the [[trench warfare]] of the [[First World War]], which had occurred along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Franco-German border]].<ref name=lunde3/>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, the Norwegian government had mobilized parts of the [[Norwegian Army]] and all but two of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]]'s warships. The [[Norwegian Army Air Service]] and the [[Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service]] were also called up to protect Norwegian neutrality from violations by the warring countries. The first such violations were the sinkings in Norwegian territorial waters of several British ships by German [[U-boat]]s. In the following months aircraft from all the belligerents violated Norwegian neutrality.<ref name=vakt>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Lars |last=Borgersrud |authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=n\u00f8ytralitetsvakt|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate=|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=313 |language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nAlmost immediately after the outbreak of war, the British began pressuring the Norwegian government to provide the United Kingdom with the services of the Norwegian merchant navy, themselves being in dire need of shipping in order to oppose the strength of Nazi forces. Following protracted negotiations between 25 September and 20 November 1939, the Norwegians agreed to charter 150 [[Tanker (ship)|tankers]], as well as other ships with a tonnage of 450,000 gross tons. The Norwegian government's concern for the country's supply lines played an important role in persuading them to accept the agreement.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Atle|last=Thowsen |authorlink=Atle Thowsen|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=tonnasjeavtalen med Storbritannia|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate=|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=422|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\n===Value of Norway===\nNorway, although neutral, was considered strategically important for both sides of the war for several reasons.

By early 1940 their [[6th Division (Norway)|6th Division]] in [[Finnmark]] and [[Troms]] fielded 9,500 troops to defend against Soviet attack, positioned mostly in the eastern regions of Finnmark.

With the [[Moscow Peace Treaty (1940)|Moscow Peace Treaty]] on 12 March 1940, the Finland-related Allied plans were dropped.

When ''Altmark'' began the return journey to Germany she carried 299 prisoners taken from the Allied ships sunk by ''Admiral Graf Spee''.<ref name=altmark/> ''Altmark'' entered Norwegian territorial waters near the [[Trondheimsfjord]], flying the Imperial Service Flag (''Reichsdienstflagge''). A Norwegian naval escort was provided as ''Altmark'' proceeded southwards, hugging the Norwegian coastline. As ''Altmark'' was nearing Bergen harbour on 14 February, the Norwegian naval authorities demanded to inspect the German ship. Even though international law did not ban the transfer of prisoners of war through neutral waters, the German captain refused the inspection. This led the naval commander in Bergen, Admiral [[Carsten Tank-Nielsen]], to deny ''Altmark'' access to the restricted-access war harbour. Tank-Nielsen was however overruled by his superior, Commanding Admiral [[Henry Diesen]], and ''Altmark'' was escorted through the harbour. According to Norwegian neutrality regulations, government ships operated by the warring countries were not allowed to enter a number of strategically important Norwegian ports. This violation of the regulations was allowed because Admiral Diesen feared that the British would intercept ''Altmark'' if she was forced to sail closer to the edge of Norwegian territorial waters.<ref name=altmark/>\n\nOn 16 February, ''Altmark'' was spotted by three British aircraft. The discovery of the ship's location led the Royal Navy to send one light cruiser and five destroyers patrolling nearby to the area. Under the attack of two British destroyers (HMS [[HMS Ivanhoe (D16)|''Ivanhoe'']] and [[HMS Intrepid (D10)|''Intrepid'']]), ''Altmark'' fled into the J\u00f8ssingfjord. At the time ''Altmark'' was escorted by the Norwegian torpedo boat {{HNoMS|Skarv|1906|2}}. She was joined later in the fjord by the torpedo boat {{HNoMS|Kjell||2}} and the patrol boat ''Firern''. As ''Cossack'' entered the fjord at 22:20 local time, the Norwegian vessels did not intervene when the British boarded ''Altmark'' in the late hours of 16 February. The boarding action led to the freeing of 299 Allied prisoners of war held on the German ship. The boarding party killed seven Germans in the process.<ref name=altmark/>\n\nFollowing the incident, the Germans sent strong protests to the Norwegian government. The Norwegians also sent protests to the British government. While Norwegian, Swedish and American experts in international law described the British action as a violation of Norwegian neutrality, the United Kingdom declared that the incident was at the most a technical violation that had been morally justified.<ref name=altmark/>\n\nThe ''Altmark'' incident led to the Germans speeding up their planning for an invasion of Norway. On 21 February, General [[Nikolaus von Falkenhorst]] was placed in charge of planning the invasion and in command of the land-based forces. The official approval for the invasion and occupation of [[Denmark]] and Norway was signed by Hitler on 1 March.<ref name=grove/><ref name=krono/><ref name=altmark/>\n\n==Initial plans==\n\n===Allied plans===\nWith the end of the [[Winter War]], the Allies determined that any occupation of Norway or Sweden would likely do more harm than good, possibly driving the neutral countries into an alliance with Germany. However, the new French prime minister, [[Paul Reynaud]], took a more aggressive stance than his predecessor and wanted some form of action taken against Germany.<ref name=planer/> Churchill was a strong agitator for action in Scandinavia, because he wanted to cut Germany off from Sweden and push the Scandinavian countries to side with the United Kingdom. This initially involved a 1939 plan to penetrate the Baltic with a naval force. This was soon changed to a plan involving the mining of Norwegian waters to stop iron ore shipments from Narvik and provoke Germany into attacking Norway, where it could be defeated by the [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Lunde 2009, pp. 11\u201314</ref>\n\nIt was agreed to utilize Churchill's naval mining plan, [[Operation Wilfred]], designed to remove the sanctuary of the Leads and force transport ships into international waters where the Royal Navy could engage and destroy them. Accompanying this would be [[Plan R 4]], an operation where, upon almost certain German counteraction to Operation Wilfred, the Allies would then proceed to occupy Narvik, Trondheim, Bergen, and [[Stavanger]]. The planners hoped that the operation would not provoke the Norwegians to resist the Allies with armed force.<ref>Lunde 2009, p. 34</ref>\n\nThe Allies disagreed over the additional [[Operation Royal Marine]], where mines would also be placed in the [[Rhine River]]. While the British supported this operation, the French were against it, since they also depended on the Rhine and feared German reprisals on French soil. Because of this delay, Operation Wilfred, originally scheduled for 5 April, was delayed until 8 April when the British agreed to perform the Norwegian operations separately from those on the continent.<ref name=planer/>\n\n===German plans===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2006-0529-501, Nikolaus v.

It was to be presented as an armed protection of Norway's neutrality.\n\nOne subject debated by German strategists was the occupation of Denmark. Denmark was considered vital because its location facilitated greater air and naval control of the area. While some wanted to simply pressure Denmark to acquiesce, it was eventually determined that it would be safer for the operation if Denmark were captured by force.\n\nAnother matter that caused additional reworking of the plan was ''Fall Gelb'', the proposed invasion of northern France and the [[Low Countries]], which would require the bulk of German forces. Because some forces were needed for both invasions, ''Weser\u00fcbung'' could not occur at the same time as Gelb, and because the nights were shortening as spring approached, which were vital cover for the naval forces, it therefore had to be sooner. Eventually, on 2 April, the Germans set 9 April as the day of the invasion (''Wesertag''), and 04:15 (Norwegian time) as the hour of the landings (''Weserzeit'').<ref name=krono/>\n\nIn Norway, the German plan called for the capture of six primary targets by [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] landings: [[Oslo]], [[Kristiansand]], [[Egersund]], Bergen, Trondheim and Narvik. Additionally, supporting ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (paratroops) were to capture other key locations such as airfields at [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu|Fornebu]] outside of Oslo and Sola outside of Stavanger. The plan was designed to quickly overwhelm the Norwegian defenders and occupy these vital areas before any form of organized resistance could be mounted.

''Renown''{{'}}s force was soon caught in a heavy snowstorm, and {{HMS|Glowworm|H92|6}}, one of the destroyer escorts, had to drop out of formation to search for a man swept overboard. The weather aided the Germans, providing a screen for their forces, and in the early morning they sent out ''Gruppe 1'' and ''Gruppe 2'', who had the largest distance to travel.\n\nAlthough the weather did make reconnaissance difficult, the two German groups were discovered {{convert|170|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Lindesnes|the Naze]] (the southernmost part of Norway) slightly after 08:00 by [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) patrols and reported as one cruiser and six destroyers. A trailing squad of bombers sent out to attack the German ships found them {{convert|125|km|mi|abbr=on}} farther north than they had been before. No damage was done during the attack, but the German group's strength was reassessed as being one battlecruiser,{{#tag:ref|At the time, the Royal Navy classified the {{sclass-|Scharnhorst|battleship|2}}s as battlecruisers.|group=note}} two cruisers and ten destroyers. Because of a strict enforcement of [[radio silence]], the bombers were not able to report this until 17:30.\n\nOn learning of the German movement, the [[Admiralty]] came to the conclusion that the Germans were attempting to break the blockade that the Allies had placed on Germany and use their fleet to disrupt Atlantic [[trade route]]s. Admiral [[Charles Forbes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Charles Forbes]], [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the British [[Home Fleet]], was notified of this and set out to intercept them at 20:15.\n\nWith both sides unaware of the magnitude of the situation, they proceeded as planned. ''Renown'' arrived at the Vestfjord late that night and maintained position near the entrance while the minelaying destroyers proceeded to their task. Meanwhile, the Germans launched the remainder of their invasion force. The first direct contact between the two sides occurred the next morning without either side's intention.\n\n''Glowworm'', on her way to rejoin ''Renown'', happened to come up behind {{ship|German destroyer|Z11 Bernd von Arnim||2}} and then {{ship|German destroyer|Z18 Hans L\u00fcdemann||2}} in the heavy fog around 08:00 on 8 April. Immediately a skirmish broke out and the German destroyers fled, signalling for help. The request was soon answered by ''Admiral Hipper'', which quickly crippled ''Glowworm''. During the action, ''Glowworm'' rammed ''Admiral Hipper''.<ref name=grove/> Significant damage was done to ''Admiral Hipper''{{'}}s starboard side, and ''Glowworm'' was destroyed by a close range salvo immediately afterwards. During the fight ''Glowworm'' had broken radio silence and informed the Admiralty of her situation. She was not able to complete her transmission though, and all the Admiralty knew was that ''Glowworm'' had been confronted by a large German ship, shots were fired, and contact with the destroyer could not be re-established. In response, the Admiralty ordered ''Renown'' and her single destroyer escort (the other two had gone to friendly ports for fuel), to abandon her post at the Vestfjord and head to ''Glowworm''{{'}}s last known location. At 10:45, the remaining eight destroyers of the minelaying force were ordered to join them as well.\n\nOn the morning of 8 April, the Polish submarine {{ORP|Orze\u0142|1938|6}} confronted and sank the clandestine German troop transport ship {{MS|Rio de Janeiro|1914|2}} off the southern Norwegian port of [[Lillesand]].<ref name=rio>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Fran\u00e7ois|last=Kersaudy|authorlink=Fran\u00e7ois Kersaudy|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=Rio de Janeiro|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate=|year=1995|publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=357|language=Norwegian}}</ref> Discovered amongst the wreckage were uniformed German soldiers and various military supplies. Though ''Orze\u0142'' reported the incident to the Admiralty, they were too concerned by the situation with ''Glowworm'' and the presumed German breakout to give it much thought and did not pass the information on. Many of the German soldiers from the wreck were rescued by Norwegian fishing boats and the destroyer {{HNoMS|Odin|1939|2}}. On interrogation the survivors disclosed that they were assigned to protect Bergen from the Allies. This information was passed on to Oslo where the [[Parliament of Norway|Norwegian Parliament]] ignored the sinking due to being distracted by the British mining operations off the Norwegian coast.<ref name=rio/>\n\nAt 14:00, the Admiralty received word that aerial reconnaissance had located a group of German ships a considerable distance west-northwest of Trondheim, bearing west. This reinforced the notion that the Germans were indeed intending a breakout, and the Home Fleet changed direction from northeast to northwest to again try to intercept. Additionally, Churchill cancelled Plan R 4 and ordered the four cruisers carrying the soldiers and their supplies to disembark their cargo and join the Home Fleet. In fact, the German ships, ''Gruppe 2'', were only performing delaying circling manoeuvres in order to approach their destination of Trondheim at the designated time.\n\nThat night, after learning of numerous sightings of German ships south of Norway, Charles Forbes began to doubt the validity of the breakout idea, and he ordered the Home Fleet to head south to the [[Skagerrak]]. He also ordered {{HMS|Repulse|1916|2}}, along with another cruiser and a few destroyers, to head north and join ''Renown''.\n\nAt 23:00, as Forbes was just learning of the incident with ''Orze\u0142'', ''Gruppe 5'' was confronted by the Norwegian patrol vessel {{HNoMS|Pol III||2}} at the entrance to the [[Oslofjord]]. ''Pol III'' quickly sent an alarm to the coastal batteries on Rau\u00f8y (Rau\u00f8y island) and opened fire on the [[German torpedo boats of World War II|torpedo boat]] {{ship|German torpedo boat|Albatros||2}} with her single gun shortly before colliding with it. ''Albatros'' and two of her companions responded with [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] fire, killing the Norwegian captain and setting ''Pol III'' on fire. ''Gruppe 5'' continued into the Oslofjord and cleared the outer batteries without incident. Several of the smaller German ships then broke off in order to capture the bypassed fortifications along with [[Horten]].\n\nThis activity did not go unnoticed, and soon reports had reached Oslo, leading to a midnight session of the [[Nygaardsvold's Cabinet|Norwegian cabinet]]. At this meeting, the cabinet issued orders for the mobilization of four of the six field brigades of the Norwegian Army. The members of the cabinet failed to understand that the partial mobilization they had ordered would, according to the regulations in place, be carried out in secret and without public declaration. Troops would be issued their mobilization orders by post. The only member of the cabinet with in-depth knowledge of the mobilization system, defence minister [[Birger Ljungberg]], failed to explain the procedure to his colleagues. He would later be heavily criticized for this oversight, which led to unnecessary delays in the Norwegian mobilization. Prior to the cabinet meeting, Ljungberg had dismissed repeated demands for a total and immediate mobilization, made by the chief of the general staff, [[Rasmus Hatledal]]. Hatledal had approached Ljungberg on 5, 6 and 8 April, asking the defence minister to request the cabinet to issue orders for mobilization. The issue had been discussed in the evening of 8 April, after the Commanding General, [[Kristian Laake]], had joined the calls for a mobilization. At that time the mobilization had been limited to two field battalions in [[\u00d8stfold]], further delaying the larger-scale call-up of troops. When Laake's call for mobilization was finally accepted at some time between 03:30 to 04:00 on 9 April, the Commanding General assumed, like defence minister Ljungberg, that the cabinet knew that they were issuing a partial and silent mobilization. The poor communication between the Norwegian armed forces and the civilian authorities caused much confusion in the early days of the German invasion.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Lars|last=Borgersrud|authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=Ljungberg, Birger |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=250|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref name=mob>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Arnfinn|last=Moland|authorlink=Arnfinn Moland|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=mobiliseringen i 1940|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen|location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=274\u2013275|language=Norwegian}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|first=Lars|last=Borgersrud |authorlink=Lars Borgersrud|encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=stille mobilisering|editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= |year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo|isbn=82-02-14138-9|pages=399\u2013400|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nAt about this time, further north, ''Renown'' was heading back to Vestfjord after reaching ''Glowworm''{{'}}s last known location and not finding anything.

''Renown'' engaged the two battleships off the [[Lofoten|Lofoten Archipelago]], and during [[Action off Lofoten|the short battle]] ''Renown'' scored several hits on the German vessels, forcing them to flee north. ''Renown'' attempted to pursue, but the German warships used their superior speed to escape.<ref name=grove/>\n\n===''Weserzeit''===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-758-0056-35, Norwegen, deutsche Kriegsschiffe.jpg|thumb|German destroyers at Narvik after their capture of the strategic port]]\nIn the [[Ofotfjord]] leading to Narvik, the ten German destroyers of ''Gruppe 1'' made their approach. With ''Renown'' and her escorts earlier diverted to investigate the ''Glowworm'' incident, no British ships stood in their way, and they entered the area unopposed. By the time they had reached the inner area near Narvik, most of the destroyers had peeled off from the main formation to capture the outer batteries of the Ofotfjord, leaving only three to contend with the two old Norwegian [[coastal defence ship]]s standing guard in Narvik harbour, {{HNoMS|Eidsvold||2}} and {{HNoMS|Norge||2}}. Although antiquated, the two coastal defence ships were quite capable of taking on the much more lightly armed and armoured destroyers. After a quick parley with the captain of ''Eidsvold'', [[Odd Isaachsen Willoch]], the German ships opened fire pre-emptively on the coastal defence ship, sinking her after hitting her with three torpedoes. ''Norge'' entered into the fray shortly after and began to fire on the destroyers, but her marksmen were inexperienced and she did not hit the Germans ships before being sunk by a salvo of torpedoes from the German destroyers.\n\nFollowing the sinking of ''Eidsvold'' and ''Norge'', the commander of Narvik, [[Konrad Sundlo]], surrendered the land forces in the town without a fight.<ref name=narvik/>\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-757-0038N-11A, Norwegen, Schwerer Kreuzer.jpg|thumb|upright|The German cruiser ''Admiral Hipper'' landing troops in Trondheim]]\nAt Trondheim, ''Gruppe 2'' also faced only minor resistance to their landings. In the [[Trondheimsfjord]], ''Admiral Hipper'' engaged the defensive batteries while her destroyers sped past them at {{convert|25|kn|km/h}}. A well placed shot by ''Admiral Hipper'' severed the power cables for the searchlights and rendered the guns ineffective.

The ground personnel of the Fighter Wing soon ran out of ammunition for their anti-aircraft machine guns as well; in the general confusion and focus on readying the fighters for action, no one had the presence of mind or the time to issue small-arms ammunition for the personal weapons of the ground personnel.

In order to secure the Skagerrak strait between Norway and Denmark, the air bases in Denmark had to be seized. The domination of this strait would prevent the Royal Navy from interfering with the main supply lines of the invasion forces. In this respect, the occupation of Denmark was considered to be vital.

German paratroops also captured Aalborg Airport. Simultaneously, an ultimatum was presented by the German ambassador to King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]]. The Danish army was small, ill-prepared and used obsolete equipment, but resisted in several parts of the country; most importantly, the Royal Guards located at [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen, and forces in the vicinity of [[Haderslev]] in [[South Jutland County|South Jutland]].

RAF reconnaissance soon reported stronger opposition than anticipated, and this, along with the possibility that the Germans might be controlling the shore defences, caused them to recall the force and instead use the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} to launch torpedo bombers at the enemy ships. The attack never commenced though, as Luftwaffe bombers launched an assault of their own against the Home Fleet first. This attack sank the destroyer {{HMS|Gurkha|F20|6}} and then forced the Home Fleet to withdraw north when their anti-aircraft measures proved ineffective. This German [[air superiority]] in the area led the British to decide that all southern regions had to be left to submarines and the RAF, while surface vessels would concentrate on the north.<ref name=grove/>\n\nIn addition to the German landings in south and central Norway, the Admiralty was also informed via press reports that a single German destroyer was in Narvik. In response to this, they ordered the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, mostly consisting of ships previously serving as escort destroyers for Operation Wilfred, to engage. This flotilla, under the command of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Bernard Warburton-Lee]], had already detached from {{HMS|Renown|1916|2}} during her pursuit of {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}, being ordered to guard the entrance to the Vestfjord. At 16:00 on 9 April, the flotilla sent an officer ashore at [[Tran\u00f8y]] {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Narvik and learned from the locals that the German force was 4\u20136 destroyers and a submarine. Warburton-Lee sent these findings back to the Admiralty, concluding with his intention to attack the next day at \"dawn, high water\", which would give him the element of surprise and protection against any mines. This decision was approved by the Admiralty in a telegram that night.\n\n====First Battle of Narvik====\nThough ten German destroyers had originally taken Narvik, only five remained in the harbor, with three others moving North and the remaining two going west.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_narvik_first.html|title=First battle of Narvik, 10 April 1940|publisher=|date=|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> Early the following morning, Warburton-Lee led his flagship, {{HMS|Hardy|H87|6}}, and four other destroyers into the Ofotfjord. At 04:30, he arrived at Narvik harbor and entered along with {{HMS|Hunter|H35|6}} and {{HMS|Havock|H43|6}}, leaving {{HMS|Hotspur|H01|6}} and {{HMS|Hostile|H55|6}} to guard the entrance and watch the shore batteries. The fog and snow were extremely heavy, allowing Warburton-Lee's force to approach undetected. When they arrived at the harbour itself they found five German destroyers and opened fire, starting the [[Battles of Narvik|First Battle of Narvik]]. Warburton-Lee's ships made three passes on the enemy ships, being joined after the first by ''Hotspur'' and ''Hostile'', and sank two of the destroyers, disabled one more, and sank six tankers and supply ships. The German commander, Commodore [[Friedrich Bonte]], lost his life when his flagship {{ship|German destroyer|Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp||2}} was sunk.\n\nHowever, Captain Warburton-Lee would make a fatal error when he decided to attack the German destroyers one last time. The German destroyers from the North and West converged on the British Fleet at 06:00, while the British were preparing for the final attack. ''Hardy'' was severely damaged and beached, and Warburton-Lee was killed. ''Hunter'' and ''Hotspur'' were both critically damaged, and ''Hotspur'' ran into the sinking ''Hunter''. ''Hostile'' and ''Havock'' meanwhile had raced ahead, but turned about and came back to aid the retreat of ''Hotspur''. The German destroyers were low on fuel and ammunition, allowing ''Hostile'' and ''Havock'' to come back to aid the retreat of ''Hotspur''.\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MN-1038-06, Kiel, Schwerer Kreuzer \"L\u00fctzow\".jpg|thumb|{{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}} in [[Kiel]] after being torpedoed by the British submarine {{HMS|Spearfish|69S|2}} on her way back from Norway]]\n\n====Second Battle of Narvik====\nShortly after the First Battle of Narvik, two more German ships were sunk by British forces. During the night of 9/10 April, the submarine {{HMS|Truant|N68|6}} intercepted and sank the light cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}} shortly after she had left Kristiansand. On 10 April, the [[Fleet Air Arm]] made a long-range attack from their base at [[RNAS Hatston]] (also called HMS ''Sparrowhawk'') in the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]] against German warships in Bergen harbour. The attack sank the disabled German light cruiser ''K\u00f6nigsberg'';\n\nOn 10 April, ''Furious'' and the battleship {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}} joined the Home Fleet, and another air attack was made against Trondheim hoping to sink ''Admiral Hipper''. ''Admiral Hipper'', however, had already managed to escape through the watch set up outside of the port and was on her way back to Germany when the attack was launched; none of the remaining German destroyers or support ships were hit in the assault. Better luck was had in the south when {{HMS|Spearfish|69S|6}} severely damaged the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}} at midnight on 11 April, putting the German ship out of commission for a year.\n\nWith it becoming more evident the German fleet had slipped out of Norwegian waters, the Home Fleet continued north to Narvik in the hope of catching the remaining destroyers. En route the ships suffered further harassment from German bombers, forcing them to divert to the west away from the shoreline. By 12 April, they were in range of Narvik and an aerial attack on Narvik from ''Furious'' was attempted, but the results were disappointing. It was instead decided to send in the battleship ''Warspite'' and a powerful escort force, to be commanded by Whitworth.\n\n[[File:UK-NWE-Norway-2.jpg|300px|thumb|The British-German naval battles at Narvik on 10 and 13 April]]\nOn the morning of 13 April, Whitworth's force entered the Vestfjord using ''Warspite''{{'}}s scouting aircraft to guide the way. Aside from locating two of the German destroyers, the scouting aircraft also sank an enemy submarine, the first such occurrence. ''Warspite''{{'}}s destroyers travelled {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} in advance of the battleship and were the first to engage their German counterparts which had come to meet them, thus starting the [[Battles of Narvik|Second Battle of Narvik]]. Though neither side inflicted notable damage, the German ships were running low on ammunition and were gradually pushed back to the harbour. By that afternoon, most attempted to flee up the [[Rombaksfjord]], the only exception being {{ship|German destroyer|Z19 Hermann K\u00fcnne||2}} which beached herself as she made for the Herjangsfjord and was destroyed by {{HMS|Eskimo|F75|6}}. Four British destroyers continued to chase the German ships up through the Rombaksfjord, ''Eskimo'' was soon damaged by the waiting opposition. However, the German situation was hopeless, having run out of fuel and ammunition, and by the time the remaining British ships arrived, the German crews had abandoned and scuttled their ships. By 18:30 the British ships were making their way out of the now cleared fjord.\n\n==Norwegian situation==\nThe German invasions for the most part achieved their goal of simultaneous assault and caught the Norwegian forces off guard, a situation not aided by the Norwegian government's order for only a partial mobilization. Not all was lost for the Allies though, as the repulsion of the German ''Gruppe 5'' in the Oslofjord gave a few additional hours of time which the Norwegians used to evacuate the Royal family and the Norwegian Government to [[Hamar]]. With the government now fugitive, [[Vidkun Quisling]] used the opportunity to take control of a radio broadcasting station and announce a coup, with himself as the new [[Prime Minister of Norway]]. Quisling's coup and his list of new ministers was announced at 19:32. The Quisling coup government remained in place until 15 April, when the [[Administrative Council (Norway)|Administrative Council]] was appointed by the [[Supreme Court of Norway]] to deal with the civilian administration of the occupied areas of Norway, and Quisling resigned.<ref name=krono/><ref name=admin>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Hans Fredrik |last=Dahl |authorlink=Hans Fredrik Dahl | encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=Administrasjonsr\u00e5det |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= | year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=14\u201315 |language=Norwegian }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Haakon7Small.jpg|thumb|left|The German forces attempted to kill or capture the 67-year-old King [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]].

All German demands were rejected and the [[Elverum Authorization]] was passed by the members of the parliament, giving the cabinet wide-ranging powers to make decisions until the next time the Parliament could be assembled under ordinary circumstances. However, the bleakness of the situation prompted them to agree to continued negotiations with the Germans, set for the following day. As a precaution Colonel [[Otto Ruge]], Inspector General of the Norwegian Infantry, set up a roadblock about 110&nbsp;km (68&nbsp;mi) north of Oslo, [[Battle of Midtskogen|at Midtskogen]]. The Norwegian position was soon attacked by a small detachment of German troops, led by [[Eberhard Spiller]], the [[air attach\u00e9]] for the German Embassy, who were racing north in an attempt to capture King [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]]. A skirmish broke out and the Germans turned back after Spiller was mortally wounded. On 10 April, the final negotiations between the Norwegians and Germans failed after the Norwegian delegates, led by Haakon VII, refused to accept the German demand for recognition of Quisling's new government.<ref name=krono/><ref name=elverumsfullmakt>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Eivind Otto |last=Hjelle |authorlink=Eivind Otto Hjelle | encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=Elverumsfullmakten |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= | year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=82 |language=Norwegian }}</ref><ref name=H7>{{cite encyclopedia |first=Fran\u00e7ois |last=Kersaudy |authorlink=Fran\u00e7ois Kersaudy | encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940\u201345]] |title=Haakon 7. |editor=[[Hans Fredrik Dahl|Dahl]] |editor2=[[Guri Hjeltnes|Hjeltnes]] |editor3=[[Berit N\u00f8kleby|N\u00f8kleby]] |editor4=[[Nils Johan Ringdal|Ringdal]] |editor5=[[\u00d8ystein S\u00f8rensen|S\u00f8rensen]] |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2010113005006 |accessdate= | year=1995 |publisher=Cappelen |location=Oslo |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |pages=189\u2013191 |language=Norwegian }}</ref><ref name=skodvin63>Skodvin 1991, p. 63</ref> The same day, panic broke out in German-occupied Oslo, following rumours of incoming British bombers.

His first task was to secure the Oslofjord area, then to use the [[196th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|196th]] and [[163rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|163rd Infantry Divisions]] to establish contact with the forces at Trondheim.\n\n==Ground campaign==\nWhen the nature of the German invasion became apparent to the British military, it began to make preparations for a counter-attack. Dissension amongst the various branches was strong though, as the [[British Army]], after conferring with Otto Ruge, wanted to assault Trondheim in Central Norway while Churchill insisted on reclaiming Narvik. It was decided to send troops to both locations as a compromise. Admiral [[William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork and Orrery|Lord Cork]] was in overall command of the Allied operations.<ref>Dildy 2007, p. 17</ref>\n\n===Campaign in eastern Norway===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H26353, Norwegen, Kampf um ein brennendes Dorf.jpg|thumb|German infantry attacking through a burning Norwegian village]]\nAfter the appointment of Ruge as Commanding General on 10 April, the Norwegian strategy was to fight delaying actions against the Germans advancing northwards from Oslo to link up with the invasion forces at Trondheim. The main aim of the Norwegian effort in [[eastern Norway]] was to give the Allies enough time to recapture Trondheim, and start a counter-offensive against the German main force in the Oslo area. The region surrounding the Oslofjord was defended by the [[1st Division (Norway)|1st Division]], commanded by Major General [[Carl Johan Erichsen]]. The rest of the region was covered by the [[2nd Division (Norway)|2nd Division]], commanded by Major General [[Jacob Hvinden Haug]]. Having been prevented from mobilizing in an orderly fashion by the German invasion, improvised Norwegian units were sent into action against the Germans. Several of the units facing the German advance were led by officers especially selected by Ruge to replace commanders who had failed to show sufficient initiative and aggression in the early days of the campaign. The German offensive aimed at linking up their forces in Oslo and Trondheim began on 14 April, with an advance north from Oslo towards the [[Gudbrandsdalen]] and [[\u00d8sterdalen]] valleys. [[H\u00f8nefoss]] was the first town to fall to the advancing German forces. North of H\u00f8nefoss the Germans began meeting Norwegian resistance, first delaying actions and later units fighting organized defensive actions. During intense fighting with heavy casualties on both sides, troops of the Norwegian Infantry Regiment 6 blunted the German advance at the village of [[Haugsbygd]] on 15 April. The Germans only broke through the Norwegian lines at Haugsbygd the next day after employing panzers for the first time in Norway.

Following the German invasion General Fleischer assumed the position of commander-in-chief of all Norwegian forces in northern Norway. The Norwegian counter-offensive against the Germans at Narvik was hampered by Fleischer's decision to retain significant forces in Eastern Finnmark to guard against a possible Soviet attack in the far north.<ref name=fleischer/>\n\nAlong with the Allied landings at \u00c5ndalsnes and Namsos, aimed against Trondheim, further forces were deployed to the north of Norway and assigned the task of recapturing Narvik. Like the campaign in the south, the Narvik expedition faced numerous obstacles.\n\nOne of the first problems faced by the Allies was that the command was not unified, or even truly organized. The naval forces in the area were led by [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]] [[William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork]] who had been ordered to rid the area of the Germans as soon as possible. In contrast, the commander of the ground forces, Major-General [[Pierse Joseph Mackesy|Pierse Mackesy]], was ordered not to land his forces in any area strongly held by the Germans and to avoid damaging populated areas. The two met on 15 April to determine the best course of action. Lord Cork argued for an immediate assault on Narvik and Mackesy countered that such a move would lead to heavy casualties for his attacking troops. Cork eventually conceded to Mackesy's viewpoint.\n\nMackesy's force was originally codenamed ''Avonforce'', later ''Rupertforce''.<ref>Sandvik 1965I, pp. 204\u2013206</ref><ref>Sandvik 1965II, p. 354</ref> The force consisted of the [[24th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|24th Guards Brigade]], led by Brigadier [[William Fraser (British Army officer)|William Fraser]], and French and Polish units led by Brigadier [[Antoine B\u00e9thouart]].<ref name=dildy29/> The main force began landing at [[Harstad]], a port town on the island of [[Hinn\u00f8ya]], on 14 April.

The excavations were focused on an important house (\"Building A\"<ref>[https://hatrasite.com/ledificio-a/ Building A]</ref>), located close to the Temenos, and on deep soundings in the Temenos central area.<ref>[https://hatrasite.com/i-sondaggi-del-temenos/ deep soundings]</ref> Now the Expedition is active in different projects regarding the preservation and development of the archaeological site.<ref>[https://hatrasite.com/progetti/ projects]</ref>\n\nIn 2004, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' stated \"Hatra's finely preserved columns and statues make it one of the most impressive of Iraq's archaeological sites\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1450907/American-troops-launch-Exorcist-tour-at-ancient-temple.html |title=American troops launch 'Exorcist' tour at ancient temple |work=The Telegraph |first=Colin |last=Freeman |date=4 January 2004}}</ref>\n\n=== Destruction by ISIL ===\nActions by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]], which occupied the area in mid-2014, have been a major threat to Hatra. In early 2015 they announced their [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|intention to destroy]] many artifacts, claiming that such \"graven images\" were un-Islamic, encouraged [[shirk (Islam)|shirk]] (or polytheism), and could not be permitted to exist, despite the preservation of the site for 1,400 years by various Islamic regimes. ISIL militants pledged to destroy the remaining artifacts.
