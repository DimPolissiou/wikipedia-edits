In 1678 a building was converted for use as a meeting place for the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]] by George Shaw of Bickerstaffe. Local historians believe the building had been used for another purpose long before 1678. The Quaker Friends' Meeting House, as it is now known, is a Grade II [[listed building]].\n\nThe strong link to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] in the area was maintained throughout this period by the eventual Lords of Sutton Manor, the De Holland family, starting in 1321.<ref name=sutton/> Thomas Holland, a local Jesuit priest, was arrested and tried for [[high treason]] in October 1642 as \"taking orders by authority of the see of Rome and returning to England\". The first step toward his [[beatification]] was allowed by Pope Leo XIII in 1886.<ref name=sutton/> Conversely Roger Holland was [[Death by burning|burnt at the stake]] for heresy when he continued his professed belief in the [[Reformed churches]] some 100 years earlier in 1558 during the persecution of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].<ref name=sutton/> It is suggested that Ravenhead Hall was the site of a Catholic chapel during the most severe of Catholic persecutions during the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref name=sutton/> Whilst the Lathom family maintained Rainfords close connections, as did the Ecclestons.<ref name=eccleston/><ref name=sutton/>\n\nLess well-known is the Windle connection to witches. In 1602, two women were sent to Lancaster for trial, while a decade later Isobel Roby was submitted to Sir Thomas Gerard, accused of upsetting the ship upon which [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne of Denmark]] was arriving. She was finally executed at Lancaster, along with the Pendle and Salmesburg witches, on 20 August 1612.\n\nBy 1746, St Helens, composed of the greater area of the four townships (and their collieries) beyond [[Prescot]], was referred to in a statement in Parliament related to the extension of the Liverpool to Prescot Turnpike.<ref name=Sankey/>\n\nThe rapid growth of St Helens at the centre of the townships is attested to by several authors.

The primitive mining techniques, and limited ability to bail out gathering water, meant many pits had short lifespans. Complaints are recorded in Sutton Heath in particular about the plans to expand mining across the town, but the lure of a stable income ultimately won out against the objections.<ref name=fletcher/> 100 years later, the Council rejected a planning application for an open cast mine \u2014 underlining the finality of the decline of coal mining in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sthelensreporter.co.uk/st-helens-news/Neighbours-fight-opencast-mine-plans.5389743.jp |title=Neighbours fight opencast mine plans |publisher=The Reporter|location=St Helens |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, however, coal was an enabling force for the town that opened up opportunities for further commercial and industrial developments,<ref name=\"otherind\"/> which in turn drove demand for the rapid movement of raw goods not simply out of the town (coal to Liverpool to fuel its shipping and steel works for instance, but also its salt works<ref name=fletcher/>) but also in promoting an influx of raw products for processing. The dependence of St Helens on its transport links is evident from claims made to Parliament in 1746 for maintenance and extension of the turnpike road after local flooding had damaged it.<ref name=fletcher/><ref name=Sankey/>\n\n{{cquote|''\"because Prescot, being Three Miles nearer to Liverpoole than St Helens, Persons will naturally go to the former Place for Coals, if they can be supplied as well and as cheap there as at the latter\"''|author=T.C. Barker quoting Witness John Eyes|source=Merseyside Town in the Industrial Revolution: St. Helens, 1750\u20131900<ref name=Sankey/>}}\n\nIt is clear that St Helens' development owes as much to its location on the south [[List of collieries in Lancashire since 1854|Lancashire Coalfield]] as it does the fact that Liverpool, Chester and other centres of industry were not, and yearned for the fossil fuel of choice.<ref name=fletcher/>\n\nIt was essential therefore for the town to maintain, and invest further in, transport links and promote itself as a hub for the growth of Liverpool, with its provision of raw materials benefiting from its location and promising transport links. Liverpool, recognising the need for a ready supply of coal for its forges, responded with a petition for the extension of the Liverpool to Prescot Turnpike.<ref name=Sankey/> This soon developed into a far more forward thinking development which was at the heart of the Industrial Revolution: canals.\n\nIt was originally proposed merely to make the Sankey Brook navigable, but the eventual outcome was a complete man-made canal linking St Helens to the River Mersey and the city of Liverpool. The [[Sankey Canal]] was opened in 1757, and extended in 1775, to transport coal from the pits in [[Ravenhead]], [[Haydock]] and Parr to Liverpool, and for raw materials to be shipped to St Helens.\n\nThe transport revolution centred on the region encouraged an influx of industry to the hitherto sparsely populated area. With industry came job opportunities and population growth. Between 1700 St Helens grew from a sparsely populated array of manor houses and their tenants into a sprawling span of mining operations.<ref name=eccleston/><ref name=Sankey/>\n\nOwing primarily to the abundance of coal reserves, the quality of local sand, and the availability of salt in nearby Cheshire,<ref name=\"coalsalt\"/> glass making is known to have been ongoing in the Sutton area since at least 1688, when the Frenchman John Leaf Snr is recorded as paying the Eltonhead family \u00a350 for a lease of 2\u00bd acres (1 hectare) of Sutton's Lower Hey. The glass industry got a significant lift with the Crown-authorised \"British Cast Plate Glass Company\" established in Ravenhead in 1786;<ref name=\"Pilkington\"/><ref name=\"Pilkington2\"/> it latched onto the success of similar enterprises to set the region as the market leader for glass.\n\nThe foundation of the companies owed as much to industrial leaders from outside the town (and the finance they provided) as to its natural resources. But the synchronous development of the steam engine was a significant development, with [[James Watt]]'s stationary steam engine design leading the way. Water could be pumped from deeper than ever before, and mines could be driven to find even more dense seams.<ref name=fletcher/> At the same time, the growth in use of machinery (e.g. for mills, forges, and ships) rapidly increased the demand for coal - to which the town responded.<ref name=fletcher/>\n\nLand exchanged hands in St Helens rapidly, as established families moved out of the growing towns filled with the working classes to more gentrified and less industrially developed places. In their place came self-made wealthy industrialists such as John Mackay (who first leased land in St Helens in the 1760s from [[King George III]] before buying the land constituting Ravenhead Farm from the Archbishop of York), Michael Hughes, the Gambles, and later Thomas Beecham, Thomas Greenall and the Pilkingtons.<ref name=\"copper2\"/><ref name=fletcher/> A few established families remained, such as the Gerards of Windle Hall. They made their land available for industrial use.<ref name=fletcher/>\n\n{{cquote|''\"if any&nbsp;... good colliers&nbsp;... will apply at Thatto Heath Colliery, they will meet with constant employ and the best encouragement.\"''|author=Mike Fletcher quoting John Mackay|source=Black Gold & Hot Sand, 200<ref name=fletcher/>}}\n\nOne of the first major industries to grow out of the transport innovations in the region was copper smelting.<ref name=\"copper2\"/> The [[Parys mountain|Parys]] mining company, led by Michael Hughes, leased land from John Mackay close to the newly constructed Sankey Canal at Ravenhead (where Ravenhead Colliery had since been established).<ref name=fletcher/><ref name=Sankey/> This allowed copper ore carried from [[Amlwch]] in [[Anglesey]], North Wales to arrive in the St Helens region via the Mersey directly at the point where coal was being excavated to fire the forges of industry. Some 10,000 tons of copper ore yielding over 1,300 tons of copper passed along this route.<ref name=\"copper2\"/><ref name=\"copper1\"/> At the same time the Gerards were renting out land in Blackbrook to Patten & Co. from nearby Warrington.<ref name=\"journaltransport\">{{cite book | title=The Journal of Transport History, Volumes 2-3 | publisher=Manchester University Press | year=1955 |pages=175\u2013176}}</ref> The company smelted using the Gerards 'own coal, then moved the coal downstream from a private wharf on the navigable brook.<ref name=fletcher/><ref name=\"journaltransport\"/>\n\nThe boom did not last: by 1783, coal industry leaders such as Mackay, Sarah Clayton and Thomas Case were all dead, penniless or both as a global constriction on coal shipments stifled the industry. An over-reliance on shipping to the USA during the War of Independence (1775\u20131783) ruined many people, and led to the permanent loss of several smaller industries.<ref name=fletcher/> It took partnership and coordination with other industries for the mining industry to recover; with the US embargo lifted, the US the town's troubles were soon overcome if not forgotten, although this was not the last troubling incident.<ref name=fletcher/>\n\nThe demand for chemicals such as alkali from the glass industry soon led the Gamble family to start their lime and alkali pits, saving on import costs. The growing demand for chemical processing also contributed heavily to the growth of [[Widnes]].\n\nThe [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] opened in 1830. It passed through the southern edge of the town at Rainhill and St Helens Junction, and furthered its economic development as a centre of industry.<ref name=\"coalsalt\"/>\n\n===The decline of the mining industry===\nThe last coal mine located close to the town centre (Ravenhead Colliery) and those located in the outlying districts of St Helens, including those that were just outside the original 1887 County Borough boundary, such as Clock Face (Clock Face Colliery), Sutton (Bold Colliery), Sutton Heath (Lea Green Colliery), Sutton Manor (Sutton Manor Colliery) and Haydock (Lyme Pit, Wood Pit, Old Boston), were all closed between the nationalisation of the deep coal mining industry in 1947 and 24 May 1991, when Sutton Manor Colliery, the last to go in the immediate St Helens area, finally closed its gates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmrs.org.uk/mines-map/coal-mining-in-the-british-isles/lancashire-coalfield/st-helens-coalfield/sutton-manor-colliery-1906-1991/|title=Sutton Manor Colliery (1906-1991)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe coal mining industry in St Helens and elsewhere had collapsed because the government maintained that the deep mining of coal was no longer an economically viable proposition in most British coalfields.

After the collapse of the miners' strike in March 1985, St Helens was just one of dozens of towns in the UK that was immediately set to lose a long-standing employer.

Church Street, the main high street, runs parallel to Church Square and is sandwiched by the town's second shopping centre known as The Hardshaw Centre. These primary centres contain many of the most popular British retail chains such as Boots, BHS, Topshop and Marks & Spencer. The other main shopping streets in the town centre include the more traditional small store based Bridge Street, Duke Street and Westfield Street populated by independent specialists.\n\nThe town centre has several supermarkets including mainstream stores such as [[Asda]] and [[Tesco]], as well as smaller stores such as [[Lidl]]. [[Morrisons]] retain three stores located in the Eccleston, Sutton and Earlestown areas of the town.  There is also a Tesco superstore in Earlestown, which is on a former Safeway site and many smaller Tesco Express and Tesco Metro stores.

It has a community library and two churches: the Protestant St David's and the Catholic St Patrick's.\n\n[[The Burgies]] are two [[tailings]] on the site of the old Rushy Park coal mine. They were created by dumping toxic chemical waste from the manufacture of glass; they have since been covered with tall grass and woodland.\n\nSt Helens was struck by [[1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak|an F1/T2 tornado]] on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.<ref>http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi</ref> Damage from the tornado occurred in St Helens town centre.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Location===\n[[File:St Helens 07.07R edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|St Helens viewed looking southwest in 2007.

The town is also served by the parallel-running north\u2013south routes of the [[M57 motorway|M57]] and [[M6 motorway|M6]] to the east and west.\n\nThe M6 runs a few miles to the eastern side of the town centre, with Junction 23, at [[Haydock]], serving both northbound and southbound traffic and Junction 24, at Ashton in Makerfield, serving southbound exit and northbound access.\n\nThe [[M62 motorway|M62]] runs a couple of miles to the south of the town with Junction 7 at [[Rainhill]] Stoops. The [[M57 motorway|M57]]'s Junction 2 lies several miles south-west of St. Helens, at Prescot. The [[M58 motorway|M58]] is several miles north, at the north-western end of the A570 Rainford By-Pass dual carriageway.\n\nThe [[A580 road|A580]] East Lancashire Road runs north of the town centre alongside Eccleston, [[Moss Bank]] and through [[Haydock]]. It is a dual-carriageway former trunk road taking traffic from [[Manchester]] to the Liverpool Docks. It was built between 1929 and 1934 and was opened by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. It was intended to take pressure away from the [[A58 road|A58]], a major road running from Prescot (M57) through St Helens to the [[A1(M)]] at [[Wetherby]], [[West Yorkshire]].\n\nThe Rainford By-Pass is a section of the [[A570 road|A570]], between the East Lancashire Road and the M58 and is part of the transport route from [[Southport]], in [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]], through West Lancashire, through St Helens to the M62 Junction 7 at Rainhill.\n\nA major development in communication was the opening of the dual-carriageway St Helens Linkway (classified as part of the A570) in 1994, which linked the town centre directly with the M62 (at Rainhill). The [[A572 road|A572]] takes traffic from the town centre through Parr to [[Earlestown]] and [[Newton-le-Willows]].\n\nIn 2010 St Helens was proclaimed \"UK's most car-friendly town\" measured on variables such as \"petrol prices, parking costs and the number of speed cameras in an assessment carried out by Virgin Money Car Insurance\" in research conducted by ''The Independent'' newspaper.<ref name=virginmoney>{{cite news |title=London voted least car-friendly town | author= Peter Woodman |newspaper=The Independent |date=14 July 2010 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/motoring-news/london-voted-least-carfriendly-town-2026230.html }}</ref>\n\n===Bus===\n[[File:StHelensBus.jpg|right|thumb|A St Helens Corporation liveried bus in 1968, in front of the Town Hall]]\n[[File:Tecnobus Pantheon 1.jpg|right|thumb|Battery-electric minibus in St Helens]]\nSt Helens has a central bus station that sits between Bickerstaffe Street and Corporation Street.

Following local government re-organisation in 1974, the [[Merseytravel|Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive]] (Merseytravel) was expanded to cover St Helens. After privatisation in 1986 the town was served by several locally branded operations under the umbrella of the [[MTL (transport company)|Merseyside Transport Limited]] (MTL) company in which Merseytravel retained shares until 1993.\n\n[[Arriva]] purchased MTL in 2000 and has operated the majority of the routes since.

It also held Council meetings for [[Aldermen]] and Parishioners alike.\n\nIn 1868, St Helens was incorporated as a borough (covering the 4 Townships). In response to the old, smaller, hall burning suffering fire damage in 1872 a new hall was planned. This, current town hall, was built between 1872 and 1876. In 1889 St Helens was again reformed, this time as a [[county borough]] with greater responsibility over an increased area of land. This was part of an ongoing process of local government restructure during the Victorian era, this time as part of the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1882]].\n\nAs a county borough, St Helens was, from 1889 to 1974, inside the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of [[Lancashire]]. On 1 April 1974, under the provisions of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], St Helens became the administrative centre of the [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens]] in the newly created [[Merseyside]] [[Metropolitan county]]. At this time St Helens Council replaced all the local Councils within the prescribed area.\n\n===Historic coat of arms===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:StHelenscoatofarms.png|right|thumb|upright|St. Helens County Borough Council coat of arms 1876\u20131974, \"Ex Terra Lucem\" - ''\"From the Ground, Light\"'' granted in 1876]]\nThe old Town and Borough Council coat of arms were granted on 17 January 1876. The coat of arms is an Argent (white or silver) [[Field (heraldry)|Field]] common to earlier coat of arms in the area. The black cross is referenced from the family of the Ecclestons. The [[saltire]]s in the first and fourth quarters are from the arms of the Gerards of Windleshaw. The \"second and third a [[Griffin|griffon]] segreant\" meanwhile are taken from the Bold family. The blue bars are from the arms of the Parr family, Marquises of Northampton. The lion is from the crest of the Walmsleys and the two fleurs-de-lys refer to Sir David Gamble, first Mayor and benefactor of the town, and the Haydock family.\n\nAs the council ceased to exist in 1974, these arms are since then no longer in use. The coat of arms of the present council of Metropolitan Borough of St Helens has taken over part of its design.\n\n===Motto===\nThe motto was the Latin '''\"Ex Terra Lucem\"'''. A literal translation would be \"From the Ground, Light\" whilst more descriptive translations might be \"Light out of the earth\" or \"Out of the earth comes light\". The phrase refers to both the abundant and winnable coal resources (which can be burnt, to produce \"light\") in addition to their use in local industry such as Glass (through which light passes).\n\nThe motto of the town and larger borough was changed in 1974 to \"PROSPERITAS IN EXCELSIS\" (\"Success in the highest\"or \"Flourishing well\"), which is included on the arms of the Metropolitan borough Council.\n\nAfter the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]], [[Frank Cottrell Boyce]] the creative writer behind [[Danny Boyle]]'s opening ceremony revealed that the town motto was a significant influence to the Olympic cauldron designed by [[Thomas Heatherwick]]. The cauldron petals, once lit, started on the floor and rose up to form one torch.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/10363386.Ex_Terra_Lucem_restored_as_motto_of_St_Helens/|title=Ex Terra Lucem restored as motto of St Helens|work=St Helens Star|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=28 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe success and high profile of the games led the Council and local residents to consider re-adopting \"Ex Terra Lucem\". It was felt that it was more appropriate to the town's history and had more meaning for local people, representing hope for the future.  A number of people had raised this and requested that the Council consider replacing the motto.\n\nA public consultation commenced on 17 January 2013 and at its meeting held on 17 April 2013, Council resolved to revert to the original motto of \"Ex Terra Lucem\". The Coat of Arms remained the same.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sthelens.gov.uk/what-we-do/council,-meetings-and-democracy/councillors,-democracy-and-elections/mayor-of-st-helens/description-of-the-coat-of-arms/|title=The St.Helens Coat of Arms|work=St. Helens Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305135826/http://www.sthelens.gov.uk/what-we-do/council,-meetings-and-democracy/councillors,-democracy-and-elections/mayor-of-st-helens/description-of-the-coat-of-arms/|archivedate=5 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Parliamentary representation===\nSt Helens is represented by the [[St Helens South and Whiston (UK Parliament constituency)|St Helens South and Whiston]] and [[St Helens North (UK Parliament constituency)|St Helens North]] constituencies.

In 1602, two women were sent to Lancaster for trial, while a decade later Isobel Roby was submitted to Sir Thomas Gerard, accused of upsetting the ship upon which [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Princess Anne of Denmark]] was arriving. She was finally executed at Lancaster, along with the Pendle and Salmesburg witches, on 20 August 1612.\n\nBy 1746, St Helens, composed of the greater area of the four townships (and their collieries) beyond [[Prescot]], was referred to in a statement in Parliament related to the extension of the Liverpool to Prescot Turnpike.<ref name=Sankey/>\n\nThe rapid growth of St Helens at the centre of the townships is attested to by several authors.

The primitive mining techniques, and limited ability to bail out gathering water, meant many pits had short lifespans. Complaints are recorded in Sutton Heath in particular about the plans to expand mining across the town, but the lure of a stable income ultimately won out against the objections.<ref name=fletcher/> 100 years later, the Council rejected a planning application for an open cast mine \u2014 underlining the finality of the decline of coal mining in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sthelensreporter.co.uk/st-helens-news/Neighbours-fight-opencast-mine-plans.5389743.jp |title=Neighbours fight opencast mine plans |publisher=The Reporter|location=St Helens |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century, however, coal was an enabling force for the town that opened up opportunities for further commercial and industrial developments,<ref name=\"otherind\"/> which in turn drove demand for the rapid movement of raw goods not simply out of the town (coal to Liverpool to fuel its shipping and steel works for instance, but also its salt works<ref name=fletcher/>) but also in promoting an influx of raw products for processing. The dependence of St Helens on its transport links is evident from claims made to Parliament in 1746 for maintenance and extension of the turnpike road after local flooding had damaged it.<ref name=fletcher/><ref name=Sankey/>\n\n{{cquote|''\"because Prescot, being Three Miles nearer to Liverpoole than St Helens, Persons will naturally go to the former Place for Coals, if they can be supplied as well and as cheap there as at the latter\"''|author=T.C. Barker quoting Witness John Eyes|source=Merseyside Town in the Industrial Revolution: St. Helens, 1750\u20131900<ref name=Sankey/>}}\n\nIt is clear that St Helens' development owes as much to its location on the south [[List of collieries in Lancashire since 1854|Lancashire Coalfield]] as it does the fact that Liverpool, Chester and other centres of industry were not, and yearned for the fossil fuel of choice.<ref name=fletcher/>\n\nIt was essential therefore for the town to maintain, and invest further in, transport links and promote itself as a hub for the growth of Liverpool, with its provision of raw materials benefiting from its location and promising transport links. Liverpool, recognising the need for a ready supply of coal for its forges, responded with a petition for the extension of the Liverpool to Prescot Turnpike.<ref name=Sankey/> This soon developed into a far more forward thinking development which was at the heart of the Industrial Revolution: canals.\n\nIt was originally proposed merely to make the Sankey Brook navigable, but the eventual outcome was a complete man-made canal linking St Helens to the River Mersey and the city of Liverpool. The [[Sankey Canal]] was opened in 1757, and extended in 1775, to transport coal from the pits in [[Ravenhead]], [[Haydock]] and Parr to Liverpool, and for raw materials to be shipped to St Helens.\n\nThe transport revolution centred on the region encouraged an influx of industry to the hitherto sparsely populated area. With industry came job opportunities and population growth. Between 1700 St Helens grew from a sparsely populated array of manor houses and their tenants into a sprawling span of mining operations.<ref name=eccleston/><ref name=Sankey/>\n\nOwing primarily to the abundance of coal reserves, the quality of local sand, and the availability of salt in nearby Cheshire,<ref name=\"coalsalt\"/> glass making is known to have been ongoing in the Sutton area since at least 1688, when the Frenchman John Leaf Snr is recorded as paying the Eltonhead family \u00a350 for a lease of 2\u00bd acres (1 hectare) of Sutton's Lower Hey. The glass industry got a significant lift with the Crown-authorised \"British Cast Plate Glass Company\" established in Ravenhead in 1786;<ref name=\"Pilkington\"/><ref name=\"Pilkington2\"/> it latched onto the success of similar enterprises to set the region as the market leader for glass.\n\nThe foundation of the companies owed as much to industrial leaders from outside the town (and the finance they provided) as to its natural resources. But the synchronous development of the steam engine was a significant development, with [[James Watt]]'s stationary steam engine design leading the way. Water could be pumped from deeper than ever before, and mines could be driven to find even more dense seams.<ref name=fletcher/> At the same time, the growth in use of machinery (e.g. for mills, forges, and ships) rapidly increased the demand for coal - to which the town responded.<ref name=fletcher/>\n\nLand exchanged hands in St Helens rapidly, as established families moved out of the growing towns filled with the working classes to more gentrified and less industrially developed places. In their place came self-made wealthy industrialists such as John Mackay (who first leased land in St Helens in the 1760s from [[King George III]] before buying the land constituting Ravenhead Farm from the Archbishop of York), Michael Hughes, the Gambles, and later Thomas Beecham, Thomas Greenall and the Pilkingtons.<ref name=\"copper2\"/><ref name=fletcher/> A few established families remained, such as the Gerards of Windle Hall. They made their land available for industrial use.<ref name=fletcher/>\n\n{{cquote|''\"if any&nbsp;... good colliers&nbsp;... will apply at Thatto Heath Colliery, they will meet with constant employ and the best encouragement.\"''|author=Mike Fletcher quoting John Mackay|source=Black Gold & Hot Sand, 200<ref name=fletcher/>}}\n\nOne of the first major industries to grow out of the transport innovations in the region was copper smelting.<ref name=\"copper2\"/> The [[Parys mountain|Parys]] mining company, led by Michael Hughes, leased land from John Mackay close to the newly constructed Sankey Canal at Ravenhead (where Ravenhead Colliery had since been established).<ref name=fletcher/><ref name=Sankey/> This allowed copper ore carried from [[Amlwch]] in [[Anglesey]], North Wales to arrive in the St Helens region via the Mersey directly at the point where coal was being excavated to fire the forges of industry. Some 10,000 tons of copper ore yielding over 1,300 tons of copper passed along this route.<ref name=\"copper2\"/><ref name=\"copper1\"/> At the same time the Gerards were renting out land in Blackbrook to Patten & Co. from nearby Warrington.<ref name=\"journaltransport\">{{cite book | title=The Journal of Transport History, Volumes 2-3 | publisher=Manchester University Press | year=1955 |pages=175\u2013176}}</ref> The company smelted using the Gerards 'own coal, then moved the coal downstream from a private wharf on the navigable brook.<ref name=fletcher/><ref name=\"journaltransport\"/>\n\nThe boom did not last: by 1783, coal industry leaders such as Mackay, Sarah Clayton and Thomas Case were all dead, penniless or both as a global constriction on coal shipments stifled the industry. An over-reliance on shipping to the USA during the War of Independence (1775\u20131783) ruined many people, and led to the permanent loss of several smaller industries.<ref name=fletcher/> It took partnership and coordination with other industries for the mining industry to recover; with the US embargo lifted, the US the town's troubles were soon overcome if not forgotten, although this was not the last troubling incident.<ref name=fletcher/>\n\nThe demand for chemicals such as alkali from the glass industry soon led the Gamble family to start their lime and alkali pits, saving on import costs. The growing demand for chemical processing also contributed heavily to the growth of [[Widnes]].\n\nThe [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] opened in 1830. It passed through the southern edge of the town at Rainhill and St Helens Junction, and furthered its economic development as a centre of industry.<ref name=\"coalsalt\"/>\n\n===The decline of the mining industry===\nThe last coal mine located close to the town centre (Ravenhead Colliery) and those located in the outlying districts of St Helens, including those that were just outside the original 1887 County Borough boundary, such as Clock Face (Clock Face Colliery), Sutton (Bold Colliery), Sutton Heath (Lea Green Colliery), Sutton Manor (Sutton Manor Colliery) and Haydock (Lyme Pit, Wood Pit, Old Boston), were all closed between the nationalisation of the deep coal mining industry in 1947 and 24 May 1991, when Sutton Manor Colliery, the last to go in the immediate St Helens area, finally closed its gates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nmrs.org.uk/mines-map/coal-mining-in-the-british-isles/lancashire-coalfield/st-helens-coalfield/sutton-manor-colliery-1906-1991/|title=Sutton Manor Colliery (1906-1991)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe coal mining industry in St Helens and elsewhere had collapsed because the government maintained that the deep mining of coal was no longer an economically viable proposition in most British coalfields. The closures were opposed by the National Union of Mineworkers during the year-long [[UK miners' strike (1984\u20131985)|Miners' Strike]] of 1984\u201385. After the collapse of the miners' strike in March 1985, St Helens was just one of dozens of towns in the UK that was immediately set to lose a long-standing employer. In the case of both Sutton Manor and Bold Collieries, it was estimated by some that when they were closed they each still had up to 40 years of winnable coal reserves.<ref name=CoalHistory>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/content/articles/2009/02/23/miners_gary_conley_feature.shtml |title=A choice between head and heart|first=Paul|last=Coslett |publisher=BBC Online |date=23 February 2009 |accessdate=21 June 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"SuttonBeauty\">{{cite web |url=http://www.suttonbeauty.org.uk/beauty/manorwoodlands/ |title=Sutton Manor Woodland in St. Helens |publisher=Sutton Beauty |accessdate=21 June 2010}}</ref> The last colliery in the modern [[metropolitan borough]], and in the St Helens area of the South Lancashire Coalfield, was Parkside, in [[Newton-le-Willows]], which was closed in 1993.\n\n==Economy==\n\n[[File:PilkingtonHeadOfficeStHelens.jpg|right|thumb|The distinctive blue [[Pilkington]]'s Head Office, a Grade II listed building constructed in 1959\u201363 designed by [[Maxwell Fry]] and [[Jane Drew]].]]\nThe glass industry is no longer the major employer it once was; however, it still employs over a thousand people in the town.<ref>Taken from [http://www.culture.gov.uk/Cap/proposals/St_Helens.pdf St Helens Casino Bid Background Information 1.4.1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205173030/http://www.culture.gov.uk/cap/proposals/St_Helens.pdf |date=5 February 2007 }}</ref> The large [[Pilkington Glass|Pilkington Brothers]] works, founded in 1826, dominates the town's industrial quarter and still produces all the UK's output of flat glass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolcityregion.uk/main-associations-in-st-helens.html|title=Main Associations in St.Helens - Liverpool City Region {{!}}  Liverpool {{!}} Wirral {{!}} Sefton {{!}} St.Helens {{!}} Knowsley {{!}} Halton|last=WebDesignHalton.com|website=www.liverpoolcityregion.uk|access-date=2018-07-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, planning permission was sought out for a link road connecting the M62 directly with the town centre.<ref name=planningravenhead>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/29sep94-uk-planning-st-helens-merseyside-burtonhead-road-m62-link-road/986292.article|title=29Sep94 UK: PLANNING - ST.

Church Street, the main high street, runs parallel to Church Square and is sandwiched by the town's second shopping centre known as The Hardshaw Centre. These primary centres contain many of the most popular British retail chains such as Boots, BHS, Topshop and Marks & Spencer. The other main shopping streets in the town centre include the more traditional small store based Bridge Street, Duke Street and Westfield Street populated by independent specialists.\n\nThe town centre has several supermarkets including mainstream stores such as [[Asda]] and [[Tesco]], as well as smaller stores such as [[Lidl]]. [[Morrisons]] retain three stores located in the Eccleston, Sutton and Earlestown areas of the town.  There is also a Tesco superstore in Earlestown, which is on a former Safeway site and many smaller Tesco Express and Tesco Metro stores.

The older of these, St Helens Retail Park, is home to several discount stores and wholesale retailers.\n\nThe larger Ravenhead Retail Park houses more large-scale mainstream retail stores,  and a number of restaurants, fast food outlets and cafes.

The highest point in the borough, and in the whole of Merseyside, is [[Billinge Hill]], 4.5 miles (7&nbsp;km) north of the town centre. From the top of this hill the cities of [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] are visible on a clear day, as well as the towns of [[Wigan]], [[Bolton]] and [[Warrington]]. The Mill Brook/Windle Brook runs through Eccleston and connects with the disused St Helens branch/section of the [[Sankey Canal]] in the town centre. St Helens is around {{convert|160|ft|-1|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].\n\n[[Carr Mill Dam]] is Merseyside's largest body of inland water, with lakeside trails and walks. It is used for national competitive powerboating and angling events.\n\nMoss Bank, a suburb of St Helens, is about 4&nbsp;km (2.5 miles) north of the town centre. It has a community library and two churches: the Protestant St David's and the Catholic St Patrick's.\n\n[[The Burgies]] are two [[tailings]] on the site of the old Rushy Park coal mine. They were created by dumping toxic chemical waste from the manufacture of glass; they have since been covered with tall grass and woodland.\n\nSt Helens was struck by [[1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak|an F1/T2 tornado]] on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.<ref>http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi</ref> Damage from the tornado occurred in St Helens town centre.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Location===\n[[File:St Helens 07.07R edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|St Helens viewed looking southwest in 2007.

The borough shares borders with the towns or boroughs of [[Prescot]] in [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]], [[Skelmersdale]], [[Warrington]], [[Widnes]], and [[Wigan]], and has direct transport links by road and two main railway lines. Its centralised location has formed the basis of the local authority's promotional literature.<ref name=heartofnorthwest/>\n\nThe town is considered part of the [[Liverpool Urban Area]] for ONS purposes.<ref name=\"Census2001\"/>\n\n===Road===\nSt Helens is well served by motorway links with the east\u2013west corridors of the M58 and [[M62 motorway|M62]] to the north and south of the town respectively. The town is also served by the parallel-running north\u2013south routes of the [[M57 motorway|M57]] and [[M6 motorway|M6]] to the east and west.\n\nThe M6 runs a few miles to the eastern side of the town centre, with Junction 23, at [[Haydock]], serving both northbound and southbound traffic and Junction 24, at Ashton in Makerfield, serving southbound exit and northbound access.\n\nThe [[M62 motorway|M62]] runs a couple of miles to the south of the town with Junction 7 at [[Rainhill]] Stoops. The [[M57 motorway|M57]]'s Junction 2 lies several miles south-west of St. Helens, at Prescot. The [[M58 motorway|M58]] is several miles north, at the north-western end of the A570 Rainford By-Pass dual carriageway.\n\nThe [[A580 road|A580]] East Lancashire Road runs north of the town centre alongside Eccleston, [[Moss Bank]] and through [[Haydock]]. It is a dual-carriageway former trunk road taking traffic from [[Manchester]] to the Liverpool Docks. It was built between 1929 and 1934 and was opened by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. It was intended to take pressure away from the [[A58 road|A58]], a major road running from Prescot (M57) through St Helens to the [[A1(M)]] at [[Wetherby]], [[West Yorkshire]].\n\nThe Rainford By-Pass is a section of the [[A570 road|A570]], between the East Lancashire Road and the M58 and is part of the transport route from [[Southport]], in [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]], through West Lancashire, through St Helens to the M62 Junction 7 at Rainhill.\n\nA major development in communication was the opening of the dual-carriageway St Helens Linkway (classified as part of the A570) in 1994, which linked the town centre directly with the M62 (at Rainhill). The [[A572 road|A572]] takes traffic from the town centre through Parr to [[Earlestown]] and [[Newton-le-Willows]].\n\nIn 2010 St Helens was proclaimed \"UK's most car-friendly town\" measured on variables such as \"petrol prices, parking costs and the number of speed cameras in an assessment carried out by Virgin Money Car Insurance\" in research conducted by ''The Independent'' newspaper.<ref name=virginmoney>{{cite news |title=London voted least car-friendly town | author= Peter Woodman |newspaper=The Independent |date=14 July 2010 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/motoring-news/london-voted-least-carfriendly-town-2026230.html }}</ref>\n\n===Bus===\n[[File:StHelensBus.jpg|right|thumb|A St Helens Corporation liveried bus in 1968, in front of the Town Hall]]\n[[File:Tecnobus Pantheon 1.jpg|right|thumb|Battery-electric minibus in St Helens]]\nSt Helens has a central bus station that sits between Bickerstaffe Street and Corporation Street.

Following local government re-organisation in 1974, the [[Merseytravel|Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive]] (Merseytravel) was expanded to cover St Helens. After privatisation in 1986 the town was served by several locally branded operations under the umbrella of the [[MTL (transport company)|Merseyside Transport Limited]] (MTL) company in which Merseytravel retained shares until 1993.\n\n[[Arriva]] purchased MTL in 2000 and has operated the majority of the routes since.

It also held Council meetings for [[Aldermen]] and Parishioners alike.\n\nIn 1868, St Helens was incorporated as a borough (covering the 4 Townships). In response to the old, smaller, hall burning suffering fire damage in 1872 a new hall was planned. This, current town hall, was built between 1872 and 1876. In 1889 St Helens was again reformed, this time as a [[county borough]] with greater responsibility over an increased area of land. This was part of an ongoing process of local government restructure during the Victorian era, this time as part of the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1882]].\n\nAs a county borough, St Helens was, from 1889 to 1974, inside the [[Administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of [[Lancashire]]. On 1 April 1974, under the provisions of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], St Helens became the administrative centre of the [[Metropolitan Borough of St Helens]] in the newly created [[Merseyside]] [[Metropolitan county]]. At this time St Helens Council replaced all the local Councils within the prescribed area.\n\n===Historic coat of arms===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\n[[File:StHelenscoatofarms.png|right|thumb|upright|St. Helens County Borough Council coat of arms 1876\u20131974, \"Ex Terra Lucem\" - ''\"From the Ground, Light\"'' granted in 1876]]\nThe old Town and Borough Council coat of arms were granted on 17 January 1876. The coat of arms is an Argent (white or silver) [[Field (heraldry)|Field]] common to earlier coat of arms in the area. The black cross is referenced from the family of the Ecclestons. The [[saltire]]s in the first and fourth quarters are from the arms of the Gerards of Windleshaw. The \"second and third a [[Griffin|griffon]] segreant\" meanwhile are taken from the Bold family. The blue bars are from the arms of the Parr family, Marquises of Northampton. The lion is from the crest of the Walmsleys and the two fleurs-de-lys refer to Sir David Gamble, first Mayor and benefactor of the town, and the Haydock family.\n\nAs the council ceased to exist in 1974, these arms are since then no longer in use. The coat of arms of the present council of Metropolitan Borough of St Helens has taken over part of its design.\n\n===Motto===\nThe motto was the Latin '''\"Ex Terra Lucem\"'''. A literal translation would be \"From the Ground, Light\" whilst more descriptive translations might be \"Light out of the earth\" or \"Out of the earth comes light\". The phrase refers to both the abundant and winnable coal resources (which can be burnt, to produce \"light\") in addition to their use in local industry such as Glass (through which light passes).\n\nThe motto of the town and larger borough was changed in 1974 to \"PROSPERITAS IN EXCELSIS\" (\"Success in the highest\"or \"Flourishing well\"), which is included on the arms of the Metropolitan borough Council.\n\nAfter the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony]], [[Frank Cottrell Boyce]] the creative writer behind [[Danny Boyle]]'s opening ceremony revealed that the town motto was a significant influence to the Olympic cauldron designed by [[Thomas Heatherwick]]. The cauldron petals, once lit, started on the floor and rose up to form one torch.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/10363386.Ex_Terra_Lucem_restored_as_motto_of_St_Helens/|title=Ex Terra Lucem restored as motto of St Helens|work=St Helens Star|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=28 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe success and high profile of the games led the Council and local residents to consider re-adopting \"Ex Terra Lucem\". It was felt that it was more appropriate to the town's history and had more meaning for local people, representing hope for the future.  A number of people had raised this and requested that the Council consider replacing the motto.\n\nA public consultation commenced on 17 January 2013 and at its meeting held on 17 April 2013, Council resolved to revert to the original motto of \"Ex Terra Lucem\". The Coat of Arms remained the same.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sthelens.gov.uk/what-we-do/council,-meetings-and-democracy/councillors,-democracy-and-elections/mayor-of-st-helens/description-of-the-coat-of-arms/|title=The St.Helens Coat of Arms|work=St. Helens Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305135826/http://www.sthelens.gov.uk/what-we-do/council,-meetings-and-democracy/councillors,-democracy-and-elections/mayor-of-st-helens/description-of-the-coat-of-arms/|archivedate=5 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Parliamentary representation===\nSt Helens is represented by the [[St Helens South and Whiston (UK Parliament constituency)|St Helens South and Whiston]] and [[St Helens North (UK Parliament constituency)|St Helens North]] constituencies.
