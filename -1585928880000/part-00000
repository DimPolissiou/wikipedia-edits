County, Florida|Sarasota County]] on the southwestern coast of the U.S. state of [[Florida]]. The area is renowned for its cultural and environmental amenities, beaches, resorts, and the [[Sarasota School of Architecture]]. The city is at the southern end of the [[Tampa Bay Area]], north of [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]] and [[Punta Gorda, Florida|Punta Gorda]]. Its official limits include [[Sarasota Bay]] and several barrier islands between the bay and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2018 Sarasota had a population of 57,738. In 1986 it became designated as a certified local government. Sarasota is a principal city of the [[Sarasota metropolitan area]], and is the [[county seat|seat]] of Sarasota County.\n\nThe islands separating Sarasota Bay from the gulf near the city, known as [[Cay|keys]], include [[Lido Key]] and [[Siesta Key]], which are famous worldwide for the quality of their sandy [[beach]]es. The keys that are included in the boundary of Sarasota are [[Lido Key]], [[St. Armands Key]], Otter Key, Casey Key, Coon Key, [[Bird Key]], and portions of [[Siesta Key]]. Previously, Siesta Key was named Sarasota Key. At one time, it and all of [[Longboat Key]] were considered part of Sarasota and confusing contemporaneous references may be found discussing them.\n\nLongboat Key is the largest key separating the bay from the gulf, but it was evenly divided by the new county line of 1921. The portion of the key that parallels the Sarasota city boundary that extends to that new county line along the bay front of the mainland was removed from the city boundaries at the request of John Ringling in the mid-1920s, who sought to avoid city taxation of his planned developments at the southern tip of the key. Although they never were completed in the quickly faltering economy, those development concessions granted by the city never were reversed and the county has retained regulation of those lands.\n\nThe city limits had expanded significantly with the real estate rush of the early twentieth century, reaching almost {{convert|70|sqmi}}. The wild speculation boom began to crash in 1926 and following that, the city limits began to contract, shrinking to less than a quarter of that area.<ref>Cummings, Ian, [http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20140615/ARCHIVES/406151028/-1/todayspaper?p=2&tc=pg ''Razing near for city icon''], Sarasota Herald-Tribune, page BNV1, June 15, 2014</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Sarasota, Florida}}\n{{Further|Spanish Florida}}\n{{Expand section|1=a summary provided from [[History of Sarasota, Florida]]|section=1|date=August 2018|small=no|talksection=History of Sarasota, Florida}}\nThe area known today as Sarasota first appeared on a sheepskin Spanish map from 1763 with the word {{lang|es|Zarazote}} over present day Sarasota and [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Origin of the Name, Sarasota |url=http://www.sarasotahistoryalive.com/history/articles/the-origin-of-the-name-sarasota/ |website=Sarasota History Alive! |accessdate=August 22, 2018}}</ref> The municipal government of Sarasota was established when it was incorporated as a town in 1902.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sarasota History |url=http://historicpreservationsarasota.org/sarasotahistory/ |website=History & Preservation Coalition of Sarasota County |accessdate=August 22, 2018 |date=October 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|25.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|38.6|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|11.0|sqmi|abbr=on}} is water.\n\nSarasota has a [[humid subtropical]] climate closely bordering a [[tropical savanna climate]], with hot, humid summers, and warm, dry winters.

Major employers include [[Sarasota Memorial Hospital]], [[Hospital Corporation of America|Doctors Hospital of Sarasota]], [[APAC Customer Services]], [[L-3 Aviation Recorders]], [[Zenith Insurance Company|The Zenith]].\n\n== Government ==\nSarasota municipal government was last incorporated in 1913, changing from a town type to adopting the city type of local government [[Local government in the United States|found in the United States]] and the title of its government changed to \"City of Sarasota\". Sarasota later was designated as the [[county seat]] when [[Sarasota County]] was carved out of [[Manatee County]] in 1921 during the creation of several new [[County (United States)|counties]]. In 1945 the [[council-manager government|commission-manager government form]] was adopted for the city and it is governed by a five-person commission elected by popular vote, two members of which serve in the ceremonial positions of \"mayor\" and \"vice-mayor\", as chosen by the commission every April. Two at-large commissioners are elected by all voters and the city is divided into three districts for which the residents of each elect one district representative to the five member commission.\n\nMany aspects of the city are overseen by the [[Sarasota County, Florida|county government]] ranging from the schools, the libraries, the bay, major waterways, county designated roads, the airport, fire departments, property and ''ad valorem'' taxes, voting, the health department, extension services, storm water control, mosquito control, the courts, and the jail. Therefore, the election of county commissioners is important to city voters.\n\nIn January 2006, the city of Sarasota made national news when the [[National Coalition for the Homeless]] and the [[National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty]] ranked it number one on the groups' list of twenty \"meanest cities\" in America in their published report ''A Dream Denied: The Criminalization of Homelessness in U.S. Cities''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/crimreport/meanestcities.html |title=Narratives of the Meanest Cities \u2013 National Coalition for the Homeless| access-date = April 2, 2010}}</ref> The city's adoption of its \"no lodging out-of-doors\" ordinance on August 15, 2005,<ref name=\"SC\">{{cite web |url=http://sarasota.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=7&event_id=993&meta_id=390210 |title=Public Hearing Re: Proposed Ordinance No. 14-5093 |publisher=City of Sarasota |date=April 11, 2014 |access-date=September 11, 2018 |page=3}}</ref> Ordinance No. 05-4640, made it illegal to sleep outside on public property without permission, as was already the case with private property.

The city has earned a national, state and regional recognition for its efforts.\n\nIn June 2019, Florida Department of Environment Secretary Noah Valenstein stated, \"Sarasota is perhaps the number one environmentally conscious community in Florida.\"\n\nSarasota is among the communities included in a two-county federally mandated [[Metropolitan Planning Organization]] that includes all of Sarasota and Manatee counties and the chairs of the three elements of that organization belong to the eight-county regional planning organization for western central Florida.<ref name=\"Charis Coordinating Committee\">{{cite web |url=http://www.regionaltransportation.org/ |title=Welcome to the Chairs Coordinating Committee Website |publisher=Charis Coordinating Committee |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n[[File:Ringling Museum C\u00e0 d'Zan front view Sarasota Florida.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Ca' d'Zan]], John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art]]\nSarasota has been a consistent cultural mecca for nearly a century.

Everett \"Chick\" Austin, the museum's first director, arranged the purchase and reassembly of the theater for performances of plays and opera.\n\nIn the 1960s the Van Wezels enabled the city to build a performing arts hall on the bay front. The auditorium, the [[Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall]], was designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s successor firm, [[Taliesin Associated Architects]] team under the direction of [[William Wesley Peters]]. Wright's widow, [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright]], who participated in the project, selected its purple color.\n\nIn 1989, Stuart Barger, a local architect, designed and oversaw the construction of another Asolo Theater, housed in the [[Florida State University Center for the Performing Arts]]. It is a multi-theater complex, located farther east on the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art property, being placed between Bay Shore Road and Tamiami Trail, and facing south toward Ringling Plaza. It was built around a [[rococo]], historic Scottish theater previously called the [[Dunfermline Opera House]], which had been shipped to Florida. The new complex also provides venues and facilities for students of [[Florida State University]]'s MFA Acting program, the [[Florida State University/Asolo Conservatory for Actor Training|FSU/Asolo Conservatory for Actor Training]]. This was the administrative home of the Sarasota French Film Festival for several years.\n\nFST's Keating Theatre, formerly the Sarasota Woman's Club, is amongst the oldest surviving buildings in Sarasota.&nbsp;Founded in 1903, the Sarasota Woman's Club eventually set out to create a meeting place to house social events, activities, and forums. On January 1, 1915 the cornerstone was laid at the corner of Palm Avenue and Park Street (now Cocoanut). It served as the town's first library and hosted numerous club and public committee gatherings. The Woman's Club also maintained a census and birth registration, an area PTA, and a Red Cross Auxiliary.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Sarasota Woman's Club relocated in 1976 and the building became slated for demolition. Marian McKenna, a patron and supporter of the arts, did not want to see the building and her memories destroyed. She purchased the building and later sold it to Florida Studio Theatre.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 1985, the Sarasota Woman's Club building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. After completing more renovations to the historic building in 2003, the theatre was renamed the Keating Theatre in honor of Ed and Elaine Keating, and in 2004, additional lobby space was built in the theatre - the Bea Friedman Room. FST's Keating Theatre now seats 173 and remains a cultural center of Sarasota.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 2003, FST purchased the Gompertz Theatre. The building was originally the Park-Seventh Movie House in the 1920s. Due to the Depression, the movie house shut its doors and became an empty venue. During its predominantly vacant period in the 1940s, the theatre hosted a variety of road shows and performers, including Tom Mix and his Wonder Horse and the All Girls\u2019 Orchestra. During this time it was known as the Garden Theater, and later the Art Theater, before becoming known as the Palm Tree Playhouse in 1951. The Playhouse closed again in the 1960s. In the mid 1970s, Asolo Theatre purchased the space for production purposes and their Stage Two Theatre program. It was subsequently sold to Anita Katzman and reoccupied by Siesta Key Actors Theatre and Theatre Works in the 1980s. The building was acquired by Florida Studio Theatre and renamed the Gompertz Theatre in honor of Mrs. Leila Gompertz, who made the lead gift enabling the purchase.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nOther Sarasota cultural attractions include, and many other musical, dance, artistic, and theatrical venues.\n\n===Performing Arts===\nSarasota has many musical, dance, theatre, circus and other performing arts venues, including the [[Sarasota Ballet]], [[Sarasota Opera]], [[Asolo Repertory Theatre]], [[Florida Studio Theatre]], the Sarasota Players, the Banyan Theater Company, The Westcoast Black Theatre, the Urbanite Theatre, Sarasota Contemporary Dance, Sarasota Orchestra, La Musica, Jazz Club of Sarasota, Sarasota Youth Opera, Circus Arts Conservatory and many others.\n\n====Theatre====\n[[File:Sarasota FL Asolo Rep Theatre01 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Asolo Repertory Theater]]\nTheatrical venues include [[Florida Studio Theatre]], [[Asolo Repertory Theatre]], [[Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall]], The Players Theatre, Urbanite Theatre, and the Westcoast Black Theatre Troupe.<ref>http://westcoastblacktheatre.org/</ref>\n\n====Music====\nSarasota is the home of the [[Sarasota Orchestra]], which was founded by Ruth Cotton Butler in 1949 and known for years as the ''Florida West Coast Symphony''.

The festival attracts independent films from around the world. It claims to be one of Florida's largest film festivals. In 2009 the annual [[Ringling International Arts Festival]], held its premier and held its closing event in the historic Asolo theater, which had been moved and rebuilt again. The historic Venetian theater now is housed in the reception building for the museum where it is used for special events as well as performances, informative purposes, and another seasonal film series hosted by the museum.\n\n[https://www.floridastudiotheatre.org/ Florida Studio Theatre] produces the annual Sarasota Improv Festival.

The Festival has become a destination event, drawing thousands of people from across the state of Florida and beyond. Past performers have come from as far as Mexico, Canada, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom to perform on Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Sarasota Chalk Festival]] that is held yearly in the historic area of Burns Square became the first international [[street painting]] festival in the United States of America. Celebrating the sixteenth century performance art of Italian street painting, the festival hosted Maestro Madonnaro [[Edgar Mueller]] from Germany, who created the first street painting that changed images from day to night.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pelicanpressonline.com/afterhours/features/105871718.html |title=Ground-breaking Street Painting |author=Walter, Nick |date=October 27, 2010 |work=[[Pelican Press]] |publisher=JCPGroup |page=Features |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110614212534/http://www.pelicanpressonline.com/afterhours/features/105871718.html |archivedate=June 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pelicanpressonline.com/localnews/106623713.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110614212528/http://www.pelicanpressonline.com/localnews/106623713.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 14, 2011 |title=Students chalk up accomplishments |author=Toner, Moira |date=November 3, 2010 |work=[[Pelican Press]] |publisher=JCPGroup |page=Local News }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20101028/ARTICLE/10281004 |title=Street art goes global this year |author=Weingarten, Abby |date=October 28, 2010 |work=[[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]  |page=E6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20101028/ARTICLE/10281004 |title=Artists to make the pavement come alive in Sarasota |author=Ball, David |date=October 23, 2010 |work=[[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]  |page=BN1 |accessdate=December 7, 2010}}</ref> The festival has a different theme each year and has introduced new techniques in street art.

Except for a few commissioned on public property in the Palm Avenue Parking Garage, the murals are on private property and they are in many sections of Sarasota and in Manatee County as well. {{As of|2014}} the Sarasota Chalk festival has relocated to Venice, FL, a small town just South of Sarasota. The name Sarasota Chalk Festival remains the same.\n\nIt is also home to the [https://harveymilkfestival.org/ Harvey Milk Festival], an independent music festival in support of [[civil rights]], focusing on the [[LGBTQ]] community. It has been celebrated in May annually since 2010 on the weekend closest to [[Harvey Milk]]'s birthday, and is currently the largest independent music festival in Sarasota, with thousands of attendees throughout the free, public, multi-day event, that also includes gallery showings, film, and other live performances.\n\n== Architecture ==\nItalian architecture and culture are quite strong in the area because of the Ringling Museum. An unusually large number of homes and buildings are designed in the Italian style, especially Venetian as influenced by Ringling's [[C\u00e0 d'Zan]]. Italian inspired statues are also common and Michelangelo's David is used as the symbol of Sarasota.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Sarasota School of Architecture ===\nThe [[Sarasota School of Architecture]] developed as a variant of mid-century modernist architecture. It incorporates elements of both the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s \"organic\" architecture. The style developed as an adaptation to the area's [[sub-tropical]] climate and used newly emerging materials manufactured or implemented following World War II.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Historic buildings and sites ===\n{{See also|List of historic sites in Sarasota, Florida}}\n[[File:Sarasota FL County crths08.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|[[Sarasota County Courthouse]]]]\nBy the end of the twentieth century, many of Sarasota's more modest historical structures were demolished. Recently, two historic buildings, the Crocker Church and the Bidwell-Wood House (the oldest remaining structure in the city),<ref>Jennings, David, ''A Tale of Two Commissions'', Sarasota Alliance for Historic Preservation, Inc. Newsletter, February 2005, volume twenty, number two, Box 1754, Sarasota, Florida 34230 \u2013 with illustrations of ''Crocker Church'' and ''Bidwell-Wood House'' by [[Kafi Benz]]</ref> first restored by Veronica Morgan and members of the Sarasota Alliance for Historic Preservation that she founded, became city property. These structures were relocated to this park, despite protests from residents who objected to the loss of park area.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Sarasota County purchased the Terrace Hotel that was built by Charles Ringling and renovated it for use as a county government office building.<ref>LaHurd, Jeff, ''Sarasota, A History'', The History Press, Charleston, South Carolina, IBSSN 1-59629-119-2</ref> The [[Sarasota County Courthouse|adjacent courthouse]] that he donated to the new county in 1921 has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Sarasota County, Florida|National Register of Historic Places]]. The courthouse complex was designed by [[Dwight James Baum]].\n\nIn the next decade the landmark hotel built by [[Owen Burns]], the [[El Vernona Hotel-John Ringling Hotel|El Vernona]], which had been turned into apartments became endangered. By then it was called the John Ringling Towers and was purchased by a phosphate miner, Gardinier, who wanted to turn it into his corporate headquarters. All of the tenants were turned out and plans were made for the restoration of the building. The city commissioners supported the plan initially, but lobbying to undermine the project began and one of the commissioners changed her vote. The project was denied at the final hearing. The enraged miner abandoned the city and subsequent owners, seeking to demolish it, made garish changes to the building to make it unappealing before finally leaving it open for vagrants to invade and pilfer.\n\nRemarkable preservation success occurred during the 1990s when the community exhibition hall, the [[Municipal Auditorium-Recreation Club|Municipal Auditorium]], designed by [[Thomas Reed Martin]] and Clarence A. Martin, was listed on the National Register of Historic Paces and meticulously restored to its depression recovery era, 1937 [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] community project, completion status and its architectural glory\u2014both inside and out. The city boasts that 100,000 people use it every year and it is a boon to the community for recreation, lawn sports, as well as being heavily attended for auctions, concerts, conventions, flea markets, galas, graduations, lectures, orchid and flower shows, and a full range of trade shows of interest to the community. Later the [[U.S. Post Office-Federal Building (Sarasota, Florida)|Federal Building]], designed by George Albee Freeman (the designer of [[Seagate (Manatee County, Florida)|Seagate]] for the [[Powel Crosley#Seagate in Florida|Crosleys]]) and Louis A. Simon, which initially had served as the post office was restored as well.\n\nMost of the luxurious historic residences from the 1920s boom period along the northern shore of Sarasota Bay also have survived. This string of homes, built on large parcels of elevated land along the widest point of the bay, is anchored by the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art at its center. Among them is ''C\u00e0 d'Zan'', the home of Mable and John Ringling, which was restored recently.\n\nMany significant structures from the comparatively recent \"Sarasota School of Architecture\" period of the mid-twentieth century, however, have not survived. Since they do not qualify under the age criteria set for historic preservation nominations their historical aspect often escapes public recognition. Others frequently are threatened by demolition plans for new development without consideration of their cultural and historical importance to the community instead of motivating the implementation of plans to retain the buildings and integrate them into new plans.\n\nIn 2006, the Sarasota County School Board slated one of [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]]'s largest Sarasota projects, [[Riverview High School (Sarasota, Florida)|Riverview High School]], for demolition. The board arrived at the decision despite protests by many members of the community, including architects, historic preservationists, and urban planners. Others supported the demolition as they believed the structure is no longer functional. The issue was divisive. The [[World Monuments Fund]] included the school on its ''2008 Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites'' in the category ''Main Street Modern''.\n\nFollowing a March 2007 [[charrette]] led by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], a proposal was advanced to renovate and preserve Rudolph's buildings. The school board decided to allow a year to consider implementation of the innovative plan proposed to preserve the buildings, that would include building a parking garage with playing fields above it rather than demolishing the structures. In early June 2008, the school board voted in a 3-2 decision to allow the demolition; School board members Shirley Brown, Caroline Zucker and Frank Kovatch voted against preserving the historic high school.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sarasota.k12.fl.us/Agenda2/June%2017,%202008%20Board%20Meeting%20on%20Tuesday,%20June%2017,%202008/91C1D8DA-C2A9-4C96-B192-147632B7E9B4Minutes.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417214354/http://www.sarasota.k12.fl.us/Agenda2/June%2017,%202008%20Board%20Meeting%20on%20Tuesday,%20June%2017,%202008/91C1D8DA-C2A9-4C96-B192-147632B7E9B4Minutes.htm |archive-date=April 17, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This decision was that school would be demolished and that a parking lot would replace it.

[[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]] was associated with the community course in Sarasota. Many courses dot the area, including the one originally laid out for the hotel John Ringling planned on the southern tip of [[Longboat Key, Florida|Longboat Key]].\n\n==== Fishing ====\n[[Sport fishing]] attracted enthusiasts to Sarasota and the area because of the amazing bounty of the bay. [[Tarpon]] was the biggest draw, but gigantic [[gar]] as well as many other species abounded to attract people such as [[Owen Burns]] and [[Powel Crosley]].

County, Florida|Sarasota County]] on the southwestern coast of the U.S. state of [[Florida]]. The area is renowned for its cultural and environmental amenities, beaches, resorts, and the [[Sarasota School of Architecture]]. The city is at the southern end of the [[Tampa Bay Area]], north of [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]] and [[Punta Gorda, Florida|Punta Gorda]]. Its official limits include [[Sarasota Bay]] and several barrier islands between the bay and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2018 Sarasota had a population of 57,738. In 1986 it became designated as a certified local government. Sarasota is a principal city of the [[Sarasota metropolitan area]], and is the [[county seat|seat]] of Sarasota County.\n\nThe islands separating Sarasota Bay from the gulf near the city, known as [[Cay|keys]], include [[Lido Key]] and [[Siesta Key]], which are famous worldwide for the quality of their sandy [[beach]]es. The keys that are included in the boundary of Sarasota are [[Lido Key]], [[St. Armands Key]], Otter Key, Casey Key, Coon Key, [[Bird Key]], and portions of [[Siesta Key]]. Previously, Siesta Key was named Sarasota Key. At one time, it and all of [[Longboat Key]] were considered part of Sarasota and confusing contemporaneous references may be found discussing them.\n\nLongboat Key is the largest key separating the bay from the gulf, but it was evenly divided by the new county line of 1921. The portion of the key that parallels the Sarasota city boundary that extends to that new county line along the bay front of the mainland was removed from the city boundaries at the request of John Ringling in the mid-1920s, who sought to avoid city taxation of his planned developments at the southern tip of the key. Although they never were completed in the quickly faltering economy, those development concessions granted by the city never were reversed and the county has retained regulation of those lands.\n\nThe city limits had expanded significantly with the real estate rush of the early twentieth century, reaching almost {{convert|70|sqmi}}. The wild speculation boom began to crash in 1926 and following that, the city limits began to contract, shrinking to less than a quarter of that area.<ref>Cummings, Ian, [http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20140615/ARCHIVES/406151028/-1/todayspaper?p=2&tc=pg ''Razing near for city icon''], Sarasota Herald-Tribune, page BNV1, June 15, 2014</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Sarasota, Florida}}\n{{Further|Spanish Florida}}\n{{Expand section|1=a summary provided from [[History of Sarasota, Florida]]|section=1|date=August 2018|small=no|talksection=History of Sarasota, Florida}}\nThe area known today as Sarasota first appeared on a sheepskin Spanish map from 1763 with the word {{lang|es|Zarazote}} over present day Sarasota and [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Origin of the Name, Sarasota |url=http://www.sarasotahistoryalive.com/history/articles/the-origin-of-the-name-sarasota/ |website=Sarasota History Alive! |accessdate=August 22, 2018}}</ref> The municipal government of Sarasota was established when it was incorporated as a town in 1902.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sarasota History |url=http://historicpreservationsarasota.org/sarasotahistory/ |website=History & Preservation Coalition of Sarasota County |accessdate=August 22, 2018 |date=October 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Geography and climate ==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|25.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|38.6|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|11.0|sqmi|abbr=on}} is water.\n\nSarasota has a [[humid subtropical]] climate closely bordering a [[tropical savanna climate]], with hot, humid summers, and warm, dry winters.

Major employers include [[Sarasota Memorial Hospital]], [[Hospital Corporation of America|Doctors Hospital of Sarasota]], [[APAC Customer Services]], [[L-3 Aviation Recorders]], [[Zenith Insurance Company|The Zenith]].\n\n== Government ==\nSarasota municipal government was last incorporated in 1913, changing from a town type to adopting the city type of local government [[Local government in the United States|found in the United States]] and the title of its government changed to \"City of Sarasota\". Sarasota later was designated as the [[county seat]] when [[Sarasota County]] was carved out of [[Manatee County]] in 1921 during the creation of several new [[County (United States)|counties]]. In 1945 the [[council-manager government|commission-manager government form]] was adopted for the city and it is governed by a five-person commission elected by popular vote, two members of which serve in the ceremonial positions of \"mayor\" and \"vice-mayor\", as chosen by the commission every April. Two at-large commissioners are elected by all voters and the city is divided into three districts for which the residents of each elect one district representative to the five member commission.\n\nMany aspects of the city are overseen by the [[Sarasota County, Florida|county government]] ranging from the schools, the libraries, the bay, major waterways, county designated roads, the airport, fire departments, property and ''ad valorem'' taxes, voting, the health department, extension services, storm water control, mosquito control, the courts, and the jail. Therefore, the election of county commissioners is important to city voters.\n\nIn January 2006, the city of Sarasota made national news when the [[National Coalition for the Homeless]] and the [[National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty]] ranked it number one on the groups' list of twenty \"meanest cities\" in America in their published report ''A Dream Denied: The Criminalization of Homelessness in U.S. Cities''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/crimreport/meanestcities.html |title=Narratives of the Meanest Cities \u2013 National Coalition for the Homeless| access-date = April 2, 2010}}</ref> The city's adoption of its \"no lodging out-of-doors\" ordinance on August 15, 2005,<ref name=\"SC\">{{cite web |url=http://sarasota.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=7&event_id=993&meta_id=390210 |title=Public Hearing Re: Proposed Ordinance No. 14-5093 |publisher=City of Sarasota |date=April 11, 2014 |access-date=September 11, 2018 |page=3}}</ref> Ordinance No. 05-4640, made it illegal to sleep outside on public property without permission, as was already the case with private property. In recent years, the City of Sarasota has revolutionized its approach to managing local homelessness focusing on casework, mental health assessments and housing. The city has earned a national, state and regional recognition for its efforts.\n\nIn June 2019, Florida Department of Environment Secretary Noah Valenstein stated, \"Sarasota is perhaps the number one environmentally conscious community in Florida.\"\n\nSarasota is among the communities included in a two-county federally mandated [[Metropolitan Planning Organization]] that includes all of Sarasota and Manatee counties and the chairs of the three elements of that organization belong to the eight-county regional planning organization for western central Florida.<ref name=\"Charis Coordinating Committee\">{{cite web |url=http://www.regionaltransportation.org/ |title=Welcome to the Chairs Coordinating Committee Website |publisher=Charis Coordinating Committee |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Arts and culture ==\n[[File:Ringling Museum C\u00e0 d'Zan front view Sarasota Florida.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Ca' d'Zan]], John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art]]\nSarasota has been a consistent cultural mecca for nearly a century.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nIn the early 1950s, the [[John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art]] purchased a historic Italian theater, the \"Asolo\" (now called the Historic Asolo Theater). This theatre was originally built for Queen Caterina of Cyprus\u2019 palace in Asolo, Italy in 1798 but was dismantled in 1931.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ringling.org/history-historic-asolo-theater |title=History of The Historic Asolo Theater |website=Ringling.org |accessdate=October 28, 2018}}</ref> A. Everett \"Chick\" Austin, the museum's first director, arranged the purchase and reassembly of the theater for performances of plays and opera.\n\nIn the 1960s the Van Wezels enabled the city to build a performing arts hall on the bay front. The auditorium, the [[Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall]], was designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s successor firm, [[Taliesin Associated Architects]] team under the direction of [[William Wesley Peters]]. Wright's widow, [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright]], who participated in the project, selected its purple color.\n\nIn 1989, Stuart Barger, a local architect, designed and oversaw the construction of another Asolo Theater, housed in the [[Florida State University Center for the Performing Arts]]. It is a multi-theater complex, located farther east on the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art property, being placed between Bay Shore Road and Tamiami Trail, and facing south toward Ringling Plaza. It was built around a [[rococo]], historic Scottish theater previously called the [[Dunfermline Opera House]], which had been shipped to Florida. The new complex also provides venues and facilities for students of [[Florida State University]]'s MFA Acting program, the [[Florida State University/Asolo Conservatory for Actor Training|FSU/Asolo Conservatory for Actor Training]]. This was the administrative home of the Sarasota French Film Festival for several years.\n\nFST's Keating Theatre, formerly the Sarasota Woman's Club, is amongst the oldest surviving buildings in Sarasota.&nbsp;Founded in 1903, the Sarasota Woman's Club eventually set out to create a meeting place to house social events, activities, and forums. On January 1, 1915 the cornerstone was laid at the corner of Palm Avenue and Park Street (now Cocoanut). It served as the town's first library and hosted numerous club and public committee gatherings. The Woman's Club also maintained a census and birth registration, an area PTA, and a Red Cross Auxiliary.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe Sarasota Woman's Club relocated in 1976 and the building became slated for demolition. Marian McKenna, a patron and supporter of the arts, did not want to see the building and her memories destroyed. She purchased the building and later sold it to Florida Studio Theatre.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 1985, the Sarasota Woman's Club building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. After completing more renovations to the historic building in 2003, the theatre was renamed the Keating Theatre in honor of Ed and Elaine Keating, and in 2004, additional lobby space was built in the theatre - the Bea Friedman Room. FST's Keating Theatre now seats 173 and remains a cultural center of Sarasota.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn 2003, FST purchased the Gompertz Theatre. The building was originally the Park-Seventh Movie House in the 1920s. Due to the Depression, the movie house shut its doors and became an empty venue. During its predominantly vacant period in the 1940s, the theatre hosted a variety of road shows and performers, including Tom Mix and his Wonder Horse and the All Girls\u2019 Orchestra. During this time it was known as the Garden Theater, and later the Art Theater, before becoming known as the Palm Tree Playhouse in 1951. The Playhouse closed again in the 1960s. In the mid 1970s, Asolo Theatre purchased the space for production purposes and their Stage Two Theatre program. It was subsequently sold to Anita Katzman and reoccupied by Siesta Key Actors Theatre and Theatre Works in the 1980s. The building was acquired by Florida Studio Theatre and renamed the Gompertz Theatre in honor of Mrs. Leila Gompertz, who made the lead gift enabling the purchase.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nOther Sarasota cultural attractions include, and many other musical, dance, artistic, and theatrical venues.\n\n===Performing Arts===\nSarasota has many musical, dance, theatre, circus and other performing arts venues, including the [[Sarasota Ballet]], [[Sarasota Opera]], [[Asolo Repertory Theatre]], [[Florida Studio Theatre]], the Sarasota Players, the Banyan Theater Company, The Westcoast Black Theatre, the Urbanite Theatre, Sarasota Contemporary Dance, Sarasota Orchestra, La Musica, Jazz Club of Sarasota, Sarasota Youth Opera, Circus Arts Conservatory and many others.\n\n====Theatre====\n[[File:Sarasota FL Asolo Rep Theatre01 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Asolo Repertory Theater]]\nTheatrical venues include [[Florida Studio Theatre]], [[Asolo Repertory Theatre]], [[Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall]], The Players Theatre, Urbanite Theatre, and the Westcoast Black Theatre Troupe.<ref>http://westcoastblacktheatre.org/</ref>\n\n====Music====\nSarasota is the home of the [[Sarasota Orchestra]], which was founded by Ruth Cotton Butler in 1949 and known for years as the ''Florida West Coast Symphony''.

The festival attracts independent films from around the world. It claims to be one of Florida's largest film festivals. In 2009 the annual [[Ringling International Arts Festival]], held its premier and held its closing event in the historic Asolo theater, which had been moved and rebuilt again. The historic Venetian theater now is housed in the reception building for the museum where it is used for special events as well as performances, informative purposes, and another seasonal film series hosted by the museum.\n\n[https://www.floridastudiotheatre.org/ Florida Studio Theatre] produces the annual Sarasota Improv Festival. Founded in 2009 by Rebecca Hopkins, FST's annual Sarasota Improv Festival brings together the best improvisers from across the country and around the world for a whirlwind weekend of spontaneous creativity. The Festival has become a destination event, drawing thousands of people from across the state of Florida and beyond. Past performers have come from as far as Mexico, Canada, Spain, France, and the United Kingdom to perform on Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Sarasota Chalk Festival]] that is held yearly in the historic area of Burns Square became the first international [[street painting]] festival in the United States of America. Celebrating the sixteenth century performance art of Italian street painting, the festival hosted Maestro Madonnaro [[Edgar Mueller]] from Germany, who created the first street painting that changed images from day to night.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pelicanpressonline.com/afterhours/features/105871718.html |title=Ground-breaking Street Painting |author=Walter, Nick |date=October 27, 2010 |work=[[Pelican Press]] |publisher=JCPGroup |page=Features |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110614212534/http://www.pelicanpressonline.com/afterhours/features/105871718.html |archivedate=June 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pelicanpressonline.com/localnews/106623713.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110614212528/http://www.pelicanpressonline.com/localnews/106623713.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 14, 2011 |title=Students chalk up accomplishments |author=Toner, Moira |date=November 3, 2010 |work=[[Pelican Press]] |publisher=JCPGroup |page=Local News }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20101028/ARTICLE/10281004 |title=Street art goes global this year |author=Weingarten, Abby |date=October 28, 2010 |work=[[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]  |page=E6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20101028/ARTICLE/10281004 |title=Artists to make the pavement come alive in Sarasota |author=Ball, David |date=October 23, 2010 |work=[[Sarasota Herald Tribune]]  |page=BN1 |accessdate=December 7, 2010}}</ref> The festival has a different theme each year and has introduced new techniques in street art.

Except for a few commissioned on public property in the Palm Avenue Parking Garage, the murals are on private property and they are in many sections of Sarasota and in Manatee County as well. {{As of|2014}} the Sarasota Chalk festival has relocated to Venice, FL, a small town just South of Sarasota. The name Sarasota Chalk Festival remains the same.\n\nIt is also home to the [https://harveymilkfestival.org/ Harvey Milk Festival], an independent music festival in support of [[civil rights]], focusing on the [[LGBTQ]] community. It has been celebrated in May annually since 2010 on the weekend closest to [[Harvey Milk]]'s birthday, and is currently the largest independent music festival in Sarasota, with thousands of attendees throughout the free, public, multi-day event, that also includes gallery showings, film, and other live performances.\n\n== Architecture ==\nItalian architecture and culture are quite strong in the area because of the Ringling Museum. An unusually large number of homes and buildings are designed in the Italian style, especially Venetian as influenced by Ringling's [[C\u00e0 d'Zan]]. Italian inspired statues are also common and Michelangelo's David is used as the symbol of Sarasota.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Sarasota School of Architecture ===\nThe [[Sarasota School of Architecture]] developed as a variant of mid-century modernist architecture. It incorporates elements of both the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s \"organic\" architecture. The style developed as an adaptation to the area's [[sub-tropical]] climate and used newly emerging materials manufactured or implemented following World War II.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Historic buildings and sites ===\n{{See also|List of historic sites in Sarasota, Florida}}\n[[File:Sarasota FL County crths08.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|[[Sarasota County Courthouse]]]]\nBy the end of the twentieth century, many of Sarasota's more modest historical structures were demolished. Recently, two historic buildings, the Crocker Church and the Bidwell-Wood House (the oldest remaining structure in the city),<ref>Jennings, David, ''A Tale of Two Commissions'', Sarasota Alliance for Historic Preservation, Inc. Newsletter, February 2005, volume twenty, number two, Box 1754, Sarasota, Florida 34230 \u2013 with illustrations of ''Crocker Church'' and ''Bidwell-Wood House'' by [[Kafi Benz]]</ref> first restored by Veronica Morgan and members of the Sarasota Alliance for Historic Preservation that she founded, became city property. These structures were relocated to this park, despite protests from residents who objected to the loss of park area.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Sarasota County purchased the Terrace Hotel that was built by Charles Ringling and renovated it for use as a county government office building.<ref>LaHurd, Jeff, ''Sarasota, A History'', The History Press, Charleston, South Carolina, IBSSN 1-59629-119-2</ref> The [[Sarasota County Courthouse|adjacent courthouse]] that he donated to the new county in 1921 has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Sarasota County, Florida|National Register of Historic Places]]. The courthouse complex was designed by [[Dwight James Baum]].\n\nIn the next decade the landmark hotel built by [[Owen Burns]], the [[El Vernona Hotel-John Ringling Hotel|El Vernona]], which had been turned into apartments became endangered. By then it was called the John Ringling Towers and was purchased by a phosphate miner, Gardinier, who wanted to turn it into his corporate headquarters. All of the tenants were turned out and plans were made for the restoration of the building. The city commissioners supported the plan initially, but lobbying to undermine the project began and one of the commissioners changed her vote. The project was denied at the final hearing. The enraged miner abandoned the city and subsequent owners, seeking to demolish it, made garish changes to the building to make it unappealing before finally leaving it open for vagrants to invade and pilfer.\n\nRemarkable preservation success occurred during the 1990s when the community exhibition hall, the [[Municipal Auditorium-Recreation Club|Municipal Auditorium]], designed by [[Thomas Reed Martin]] and Clarence A. Martin, was listed on the National Register of Historic Paces and meticulously restored to its depression recovery era, 1937 [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] community project, completion status and its architectural glory\u2014both inside and out. The city boasts that 100,000 people use it every year and it is a boon to the community for recreation, lawn sports, as well as being heavily attended for auctions, concerts, conventions, flea markets, galas, graduations, lectures, orchid and flower shows, and a full range of trade shows of interest to the community. Later the [[U.S. Post Office-Federal Building (Sarasota, Florida)|Federal Building]], designed by George Albee Freeman (the designer of [[Seagate (Manatee County, Florida)|Seagate]] for the [[Powel Crosley#Seagate in Florida|Crosleys]]) and Louis A. Simon, which initially had served as the post office was restored as well.\n\nMost of the luxurious historic residences from the 1920s boom period along the northern shore of Sarasota Bay also have survived. This string of homes, built on large parcels of elevated land along the widest point of the bay, is anchored by the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art at its center. Among them is ''C\u00e0 d'Zan'', the home of Mable and John Ringling, which was restored recently.\n\nMany significant structures from the comparatively recent \"Sarasota School of Architecture\" period of the mid-twentieth century, however, have not survived. Since they do not qualify under the age criteria set for historic preservation nominations their historical aspect often escapes public recognition. Others frequently are threatened by demolition plans for new development without consideration of their cultural and historical importance to the community instead of motivating the implementation of plans to retain the buildings and integrate them into new plans.\n\nIn 2006, the Sarasota County School Board slated one of [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]]'s largest Sarasota projects, [[Riverview High School (Sarasota, Florida)|Riverview High School]], for demolition. The board arrived at the decision despite protests by many members of the community, including architects, historic preservationists, and urban planners. Others supported the demolition as they believed the structure is no longer functional. The issue was divisive. The [[World Monuments Fund]] included the school on its ''2008 Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites'' in the category ''Main Street Modern''.\n\nFollowing a March 2007 [[charrette]] led by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], a proposal was advanced to renovate and preserve Rudolph's buildings. The school board decided to allow a year to consider implementation of the innovative plan proposed to preserve the buildings, that would include building a parking garage with playing fields above it rather than demolishing the structures. In early June 2008, the school board voted in a 3-2 decision to allow the demolition; School board members Shirley Brown, Caroline Zucker and Frank Kovatch voted against preserving the historic high school.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sarasota.k12.fl.us/Agenda2/June%2017,%202008%20Board%20Meeting%20on%20Tuesday,%20June%2017,%202008/91C1D8DA-C2A9-4C96-B192-147632B7E9B4Minutes.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417214354/http://www.sarasota.k12.fl.us/Agenda2/June%2017,%202008%20Board%20Meeting%20on%20Tuesday,%20June%2017,%202008/91C1D8DA-C2A9-4C96-B192-147632B7E9B4Minutes.htm |archive-date=April 17, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This decision was that school would be demolished and that a parking lot would replace it.

Myers an hour and 45 min south of Sarasota. All 3 offer a wider range of national and international flights.\n\n=== Public transit ===\n[[Sarasota County Area Transit]] has a bus service called ''SCAT'' which offers service throughout the county and also offers limited connections with [[Manatee County Area Transit]]. Sarasota County has joined the [[Tampa Bay Area Regional Transportation Authority]] to plan and build future transportation infrastructure including [[light rail]], [[commuter rail]] and longer range bus service.\n\n=== Rail ===\nA key issue is providing Sarasota with access to the [[Florida High Speed Rail]]. The [[Seaboard Coast Line]] ran intercity train service to the city until 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sarasotahistoryalive.com/history/markers/atlantic-coast-line-railroad-depot/ |title=Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Depot - Sarasota History Alive! |website=Sarasota History Alive! |accessdate=October 28, 2018}}</ref> There is no [[Amtrak]] train which stops in Sarasota, but Amtrak provides through-bus service at Sarasota Station, located approximately {{convert|2|miles}} from the city limits of Sarasota, to the nearest Amtrak terminal in Tampa.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=July 8, 2019 |title=Sarasota, FL (SRA) |url=https://www.amtrak.com/stations/sra |website=Amtrak}}</ref> A freight-only rail line operated by [[Seminole Gulf Railway]] does serve industries in Sarasota.\n\n=== Water ===\nAs a city located on the Gulf of Mexico, water transportation is a key consideration. The [[Intracoastal Waterway]] is a {{convert|3000|mi|km|adj=on}} [[waterway]] providing water access to and from the Atlantic coast for tugs, barges and leisure boats. [[Port Manatee]] and the [[Port of Tampa]] both provide nearby deep water ports.<ref name=\"By Air, Sea and Road\" /> Port Manatee provides cargo service primarily while the Port of Tampa is more diverse. Port Manatee formerly even had a cruise line, ''[[Regal Cruise Line]]'' that operated out of in from 1993\u20132003 until it was seized by [[United States Marshals Service|U.S Marshals]] on April 18, 2003 for not being maintained.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cruiseserver.net/travelpage/cruiselines/regal.asp |title=Cruise Line & Ship Profiles |website=Cruiseserver.net |access-date=2018-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bradenton.com/news/business/article201140084.html |title=Port Manatee has been without cruise service for 15 years.

The major roads in the area include:\n* [[File:I-75.svg|24px]] [[Interstate 75 in Florida|I-75]] \u2013 The only freeway in the area, I-75 is located 5 miles from the center of town and is a major interstate leading south to Miami and north to [[Tampa]].\n* [[File:US 41.svg|24px]] [[U.S. Route 41 in Florida|U.S. 41]] Tamiami Trail \u2013 A major north-south route through Sarasota enters central Sarasota from the south before heading west at the south end of U.S. 301.
