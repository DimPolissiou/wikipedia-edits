The theme that she chose for the contest was the traditional song \"La sombra vendo\". Luis Sanz, a Madrid manager who watched the show, was impressed by her talent and personality. Sanz contacted the program for the name and the address of the young contestant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.larazon.es/historico/4113-fallece-el-productor-luis-sanz-santiago-descubridor-de-rocio-durcal-NLLA_RAZON_429877|title=Fallece el productor Luis Sanz Santiago descubridor de Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal|date=26 January 2012|accessdate=13 January 2018|language=es|work=[[La Raz\u00f3n (Madrid)|La Raz\u00f3n]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Acting ===\nHer first film was ''[[Canci\u00f3n de Juventud]]'' (1961) directed by [[Luis Lucia]]. The plot of the film portrayed a teenager with her own personality. The movie scored huge box office and critics success. This success was repeated in other Spanish-speaking countries where the movie was shown. Immediately D\u00farcal became the star of ''[[Roc\u00edo from La Mancha|Roc\u00edo de La Mancha]]''. Following this, she got her first record deal with transnational Phonogram (now [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]]). The songs the artist played in both films served to make her first album, ''Las pel\u00edculas de Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal'' (1962). \n\nIn D\u00farcal's third film, ''Tengo 17 a\u00f1os'' (1964), she put aside her role of \"child star\". That same year, she appeared in her first theater play, ''Un domingo en Nueva York'', in which she was revealed as a great theatrical actress. In 1965 she filmed ''M\u00e1s bonita que ninguna''; the band [[Los Brincos]] wrote some songs for the movie. In 1966, she shared the spotlight with [[Enrique Guzm\u00e1n]] in the film ''Acomp\u00e1\u00f1ame''. She began to perform duets with such singers as Jaime Morey and Amalia de Isaura. Then she co-starred in the film ''[[Amor en el Aire]]'' (1967) with the then young Argentine singer-songwriter [[Palito Ortega]]. In 1968 she filmed ''Cristina Guzm\u00e1n'', the first of her films that was aimed at an audience over 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062834/|title=Cristina Guzm\u00e1n (1968)|accessdate=13 January 2018|work=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\nHer last film was with [[B\u00e1rbara Rey]] in ''Me Siento Extra\u00f1a'' in 1977.\n\n=== Singing ===\nIn 1970 D\u00farcal married Filipino-born musician Antonio Morales (known professionally as [[J\u00fanior (Filipino singer)|J\u00fanior]]), who would manage her singing career. In 1972, Antonio Morales began a series of television shows in Spain and [[Latin America]] singing with his wife as a duet. Their first child, Spanish actress Carmen Morales de las Heras, was born in December 1970. After the birth of their second child, Antonio Morales de las Heras, in April 1974, Morales decided to give up his career to devote time to their children. D\u00farcal meanwhile continued her film and singing career. In 1979 she had her third child, [[Shaila D\u00farcal|Shaila Morales de las Heras]], who took up a singing career under the stage name of '''Shaila D\u00farcal''' and is also a successful singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shaila-d%C3%BArcal-mn0000642088/biography|title=Shaila D\u00farcal|first=Gutierrez|last=Evan C.|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, D\u00farcal signed a contract with Ariola Eurodisc (with singer-songwriter [[Camilo Sesto]] supporting her in her projects) dedicating herself to the musical career. That year, while in Mexico, she met the Mexican singer-songwriter Alberto Aguilera Valadez, better known as [[Juan Gabriel]], who decided to record a whole album of rancheras performed by Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal entitled ''Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal canta a Juan Gabriel''. Without further advertising, the LP received high levels of sales, so D\u00farcal and Juan Gabriel considered the possibility of a new recording together. They ended up doing 5 LPs, marking the revival of Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal as a singer. The final collaboration between D\u00farcal and Juan Gabriel emerged in 10 albums. D\u00farcal's album named ''[[Canta A Juan Gabriel Volumen 6]]'' (1984) is among the top ten best-selling albums in the history of [[Mexico]]. For this album Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal received her first [[Grammy Award]] nomination.\n\nThe collaboration of D\u00farcal with Juan Gabriel was interrupted by disagreements between the artists and because of problems of Juan Gabriel with his record label, so D\u00farcal continued to record albums with other songwriters such as [[Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds]] and Rafael P\u00e9rez Botija (with whom under his leadership in 1981 she recorded the album of ballads ''[[Confidencias (Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal album)|Confidencias]])''. In 1988 she recorded the album ''[[Como Tu Mujer]]'' with producer Marco Antonio Solis.\n\nIn 1990, she recorded her first album on CD format entitled ''[[Si Te Pudiera Mentir]]''. In 1991, Durcal offered a concert at the National Auditorium in Mexico City, recorded in a double disc ''[[El Concierto... En Vivo]]''. Between 1992 and 1993 she recorded the album ''[[Desaires]]'', produced by the Mexican singer and songwriter [[Joan Sebasti\u00e1n]]. In this album she reprises ranchera.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/mx/album/desaires/478767063|title=Desaires|accessdate=25 March 2018|work=[[iTunes]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995 she launched her production ''[[Hay Amores Y Amores]]'', with songs written and produced by the Argentine Roberto Livi. For this album she is nominated again to the Grammy Awards in the category \"Best Latin Pop Album\". In 1997 the double album ''[[Juntos Otra Vez (Juan Gabriel and Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal album)|Juntos Otra Vez]]'' brought Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal and Juan Gabriel together again for the last time. That album was made by an engagement with the record company and not by the desire of both artists to continue to cooperate.\n\nIn 1998, under the direction of her discoverer Luis Sanz, D\u00farcal starred in the Spanish TV Show ''Los negocios de mam\u00e1'', broadcast by Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola. In 2000, she celebrated 40 years in the industry. In that year she returned to ranchera music with the album ''[[Caricias]]'', under the production of songwriter and producer [[Bebu Silvetti]]. In 2001 Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal recorded ''[[Entre Tangos Y Mariachi]]'', again produced by Bebu Silvetti, an album that includes 10 of the most famous Argentine tango arrangements interpreted with ranchero/bolero style like her previous album. In the summer of 2001 D\u00farcal made a successful tour in Spain, after 13 years of no shows in Spain. \n\nAfter a year and a half absence, she returned to the stage on 19 September 2002 with a concert at the National Auditorium in Mexico, which was recorded in a double album that was released on CD and then on DVD on 22 October 2002, ''[[En Concierto... Inolvidable]]''. The album was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award.\nIn 2003, the artist received another Latin Grammy Award nomination for her album ''[[Caramelito]]'', produced by [[Kike Santander]]. In May 2004 she returned to Spain to record what would be her last album ''[[Alma Ranchera]]'', which was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award, but did not win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/rocio-durcal|title=Rocio Durcal|work=[[Grammy Award|Grammy Awards]]|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Illness and death ==\n[[File:Cripta de Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal.JPG|thumb|Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal's crypt at [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in Mexico City]]\nIn 2001, after recording her album ''Entre Tangos y Mariachi'', D\u00farcal was diagnosed with [[uterine cancer]].

The plot of the film portrayed a teenager with her own personality. The movie scored huge box office and critics success. This success was repeated in other Spanish-speaking countries where the movie was shown. Immediately D\u00farcal became the star of ''[[Roc\u00edo from La Mancha|Roc\u00edo de La Mancha]]''. Following this, she got her first record deal with transnational Phonogram (now [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]]). The songs the artist played in both films served to make her first album, ''Las pel\u00edculas de Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal'' (1962). \n\nIn D\u00farcal's third film, ''Tengo 17 a\u00f1os'' (1964), she put aside her role of \"child star\". That same year, she appeared in her first theater play, ''Un domingo en Nueva York'', in which she was revealed as a great theatrical actress. In 1965 she filmed ''M\u00e1s bonita que ninguna''; the band [[Los Brincos]] wrote some songs for the movie. In 1966, she shared the spotlight with [[Enrique Guzm\u00e1n]] in the film ''Acomp\u00e1\u00f1ame''. She began to perform duets with such singers as Jaime Morey and Amalia de Isaura. Then she co-starred in the film ''[[Amor en el Aire]]'' (1967) with the then young Argentine singer-songwriter [[Palito Ortega]]. In 1968 she filmed ''Cristina Guzm\u00e1n'', the first of her films that was aimed at an audience over 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062834/|title=Cristina Guzm\u00e1n (1968)|accessdate=13 January 2018|work=[[IMDb]]}}</ref>\n\nHer last film was with [[B\u00e1rbara Rey]] in ''Me Siento Extra\u00f1a'' in 1977.\n\n=== Singing ===\nIn 1970 D\u00farcal married Filipino-born musician Antonio Morales (known professionally as [[J\u00fanior (Filipino singer)|J\u00fanior]]), who would manage her singing career. In 1972, Antonio Morales began a series of television shows in Spain and [[Latin America]] singing with his wife as a duet. Their first child, Spanish actress Carmen Morales de las Heras, was born in December 1970. After the birth of their second child, Antonio Morales de las Heras, in April 1974, Morales decided to give up his career to devote time to their children. D\u00farcal meanwhile continued her film and singing career. In 1979 she had her third child, [[Shaila D\u00farcal|Shaila Morales de las Heras]], who took up a singing career under the stage name of '''Shaila D\u00farcal''' and is also a successful singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/shaila-d%C3%BArcal-mn0000642088/biography|title=Shaila D\u00farcal|first=Gutierrez|last=Evan C.|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, D\u00farcal signed a contract with Ariola Eurodisc (with singer-songwriter [[Camilo Sesto]] supporting her in her projects) dedicating herself to the musical career. That year, while in Mexico, she met the Mexican singer-songwriter Alberto Aguilera Valadez, better known as [[Juan Gabriel]], who decided to record a whole album of rancheras performed by Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal entitled ''Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal canta a Juan Gabriel''. Without further advertising, the LP received high levels of sales, so D\u00farcal and Juan Gabriel considered the possibility of a new recording together. They ended up doing 5 LPs, marking the revival of Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal as a singer. The final collaboration between D\u00farcal and Juan Gabriel emerged in 10 albums. D\u00farcal's album named ''[[Canta A Juan Gabriel Volumen 6]]'' (1984) is among the top ten best-selling albums in the history of [[Mexico]]. For this album Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal received her first [[Grammy Award]] nomination.\n\nThe collaboration of D\u00farcal with Juan Gabriel was interrupted by disagreements between the artists and because of problems of Juan Gabriel with his record label, so D\u00farcal continued to record albums with other songwriters such as [[Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds]] and Rafael P\u00e9rez Botija (with whom under his leadership in 1981 she recorded the album of ballads ''[[Confidencias (Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal album)|Confidencias]])''. In 1988 she recorded the album ''[[Como Tu Mujer]]'' with producer Marco Antonio Solis.\n\nIn 1990, she recorded her first album on CD format entitled ''[[Si Te Pudiera Mentir]]''. In 1991, Durcal offered a concert at the National Auditorium in Mexico City, recorded in a double disc ''[[El Concierto... En Vivo]]''. Between 1992 and 1993 she recorded the album ''[[Desaires]]'', produced by the Mexican singer and songwriter [[Joan Sebasti\u00e1n]]. In this album she reprises ranchera.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/mx/album/desaires/478767063|title=Desaires|accessdate=25 March 2018|work=[[iTunes]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995 she launched her production ''[[Hay Amores Y Amores]]'', with songs written and produced by the Argentine Roberto Livi. For this album she is nominated again to the Grammy Awards in the category \"Best Latin Pop Album\". In 1997 the double album ''[[Juntos Otra Vez (Juan Gabriel and Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal album)|Juntos Otra Vez]]'' brought Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal and Juan Gabriel together again for the last time. That album was made by an engagement with the record company and not by the desire of both artists to continue to cooperate.\n\nIn 1998, under the direction of her discoverer Luis Sanz, D\u00farcal starred in the Spanish TV Show ''Los negocios de mam\u00e1'', broadcast by Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola. In 2000, she celebrated 40 years in the industry. In that year she returned to ranchera music with the album ''[[Caricias]]'', under the production of songwriter and producer [[Bebu Silvetti]]. In 2001 Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal recorded ''[[Entre Tangos Y Mariachi]]'', again produced by Bebu Silvetti, an album that includes 10 of the most famous Argentine tango arrangements interpreted with ranchero/bolero style like her previous album. In the summer of 2001 D\u00farcal made a successful tour in Spain, after 13 years of no shows in Spain. \n\nAfter a year and a half absence, she returned to the stage on 19 September 2002 with a concert at the National Auditorium in Mexico, which was recorded in a double album that was released on CD and then on DVD on 22 October 2002, ''[[En Concierto... Inolvidable]]''. The album was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award.\nIn 2003, the artist received another Latin Grammy Award nomination for her album ''[[Caramelito]]'', produced by [[Kike Santander]]. In May 2004 she returned to Spain to record what would be her last album ''[[Alma Ranchera]]'', which was nominated for a Latin Grammy Award, but did not win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/rocio-durcal|title=Rocio Durcal|work=[[Grammy Award|Grammy Awards]]|accessdate=13 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Illness and death ==\n[[File:Cripta de Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal.JPG|thumb|Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal's crypt at [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe]] in Mexico City]]\nIn 2001, after recording her album ''Entre Tangos y Mariachi'', D\u00farcal was diagnosed with [[uterine cancer]]. D\u00farcal canceled her tours while subjected to medical treatments, and came back to her tours in 2002.

The Central Wisconsin Racing Association (CWRA) Late Models were the featured division at La Crosse from 1970 until 1991.

In 1989 La Crosse became the first track in Wisconsin to become a part of the NASCAR Winston Racing Series (now the [[Whelen All-American Series]]), NASCAR's national weekly short track program.  The track would run the NASCAR shows on Saturday nights, which would become the main race night starting in 1992.  Five drivers (Kevin Nuttleman, Paul Proksch, [[Charlie Menard]], Steve Carlson and Nick Panitzke) would go on to claim either a regional, divisional or state championship.  Carlson would capture the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series national championship in 2007, the first for a driver from the state of Wisconsin.  Nuttleman would become the first driver in NASCAR Whelen All-American Series history to claim a championship under all three formats (Great Northern Region in 1989, Division III in 2005 and Wisconsin State Championship in 2009), and is one of the 25 greatest drivers in NASCAR Whelen All-American Series history.\n\n==Weekly racing==\n[[File:LaCrosseFairgroundsSpeedwayGrandNationalSportsman8.jpg|right|thumb|2009 Sportsman]]\n\nLaCrosse Fairgrounds Speedway hosts weekly stock car races on Saturday nights which are sanctioned by NASCAR.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwlax.edu/faculty/sherony/bus230/Complete%20Projects/La%20Crosse%20Speedway.doc|title=The La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway|publisher=UW-LaCrosse student marketing analysis|accessdate=27 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116111454/http://www.uwlax.edu/faculty/sherony/bus230/Complete%20Projects/La%20Crosse%20Speedway.doc|archive-date=16 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe headline division at the track is the NASCAR [[late model]]s.<ref name=\"NASCARTrackPage\" /> Other classes include Sportsman, Hobby Stocks (formerly Thunderstox and Beer Stox), Hornets, Street Stocks, Mini-Vans, plus several novelty events are scheduled throughout the season.<ref name=\"NASCARTrackPage\" />  Starting in 2008, the track featured Friday Night Street Drags the second Friday of the month from May to September.
