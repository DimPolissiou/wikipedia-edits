Barlow was accused of [[tax avoidance]] rather than [[tax evasion]], as the scheme itself was not illegal at the time Barlow invested in it. Barlow's lawyer responded to the claims, stating he \"paid significant tax, and that they believed the schemes were not for tax avoidance purposes but were legitimate commercial enterprises\". In May 2014 a judge ruled that the scheme was set up for the purpose of avoiding tax, with the scheme generating losses of \u00a3336 million to enable Barlow and others to offset those losses against taxes they were liable to pay from other earnings. In June 2016 Barlow (and Donald and Owen plus their manager Jonathon Wild) announced they would not be appealing a ruling that they are liable to re-pay the tax.<ref name=\"The Times 13 June 2016 page

The concert was received positively by the media, with them praising the involvement of Gary Barlow in the Children in Need project.\n\nAs well as organising the ''[[Children in Need Rocks Manchester]]'' concert, Barlow announced he was to helm the official single for the charity, a cover of [[Massive Attack]]'s '[[Teardrop (song)|Teardrop]]' accompanied by a number of artists known as 'The Collective'. The CIN Rocks concert, single and gala contributed to \u00a326 million raised for Children in Need that year.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/stars-help-break-children-in-need-record-with-42-million-fundraiser_1264134 |title=Contact Music 20.11.11 |magazine=Contactmusic.com |date=19 November 2011 |accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the week of Children in Need 2011, Barlow organised a celebrity gala with all proceeds going to the charities associated with Children in Need.\n\nBarlow also donated all proceeds from his [[Gary Barlow: In Concert]] event to [[the Prince's Trust]] charity. He said: \"I hope the money raised through these concerts will make a real difference to young lives. It's really important to me that disadvantaged young people get the support they need, especially at the moment.\"\n\nIn August 2013, the headline act to turn on the Blackpool illuminations pulled out due to unforeseen circumstances leaving the event with no one to turn on the lights or play to the 5,000 in attendance. Upon hearing this, Barlow tweeted that he would step in if the organisers would write a cheque to Children In Need. Bosses quickly made contact with him and made a donation to the charity, with Barlow turning on the lights and performing a number of his hits during the 45 minute set. Simon Blackburn, Leader of Blackpool Council said: \"Gary\u2019s very generous offer on Twitter was extremely flattering and as soon as we saw it we contacted him straight away to take him up on it. Not only has Gary taken time out of his busy schedule to play on Friday, but he has also asked for a donation to charity in place of his performance fee. I am delighted to make that donation to Children in Need.\" Graham Cain, the Council's Cabinet Member for Tourism and Leisure, said: \"Gary has shown his love for Blackpool by tweeting about the town and the Illuminations before and he even turned on the illuminations back in 1999. He\u2019s always been a fan of town and has now stepped in during our hour of need.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/gary-barlow-steps-save-blackpool-5821462 |title=Gary Barlow steps in to 'save' Blackpool Illuminations switch-on |publisher=Manchestereveningnews.co.uk |date=31 August 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124044515/https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/gary-barlow-steps-save-blackpool-5821462 |archivedate=24 November 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/125119/Gary-Barlow-Saves-Blackpool-Illuminations-Switch-On-After-The-Script-Pull-Out-Due-To-Family-Illness |title=Gary Barlow saves Blackpool illuminations |publisher=Entertainmentwise.com |date=31 August 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021230746/http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/125119/Gary-Barlow-Saves-Blackpool-Illuminations-Switch-On-After-The-Script-Pull-Out-Due-To-Family-Illness |archivedate=21 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBarlow announced in September 2013 that he would once again be returning with Children in Need Rocks, bringing some of the world's biggest musical and entertainment stars together over 2 nights to raise money for Children in Need.

He said, \"I don't think you can listen to this song without feeling inspired, it could save anybody. The lyrics are so inspirational.

Barlow was accused of [[tax avoidance]] rather than [[tax evasion]], as the scheme itself was not illegal at the time Barlow invested in it. Barlow's lawyer responded to the claims, stating he \"paid significant tax, and that they believed the schemes were not for tax avoidance purposes but were legitimate commercial enterprises\". In May 2014 a judge ruled that the scheme was set up for the purpose of avoiding tax, with the scheme generating losses of \u00a3336 million to enable Barlow and others to offset those losses against taxes they were liable to pay from other earnings. In June 2016 Barlow (and Donald and Owen plus their manager Jonathon Wild) announced they would not be appealing a ruling that they are liable to re-pay the tax.<ref name=\"The Times 13 June 2016 page
