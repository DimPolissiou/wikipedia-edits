{"title_page": "Just-world hypothesis", "text_new": "The '''just-world fallacy''' or '''just-world hypothesis''' is the [[cognitive bias]] (or assumption) that a person's actions are inherently inclined to bring [[morality|morally]] [[justice|fair]] and fitting consequences to that person, to the end of all noble actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to\u2014or expect consequences as the result of\u2014a universal force that restores moral balance. This belief generally implies the existence of cosmic [[justice]], [[destiny]], [[divine providence]], [[desert (philosophy)|desert]], [[Balance (metaphysics)|stability]], and/or [[cosmos|order]], and is often associated with a variety of fundamental [[informal fallacy|fallacies]], especially in regard to [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalizing]] people's suffering on the grounds that they \"deserve\" it.\n\nThe hypothesis popularly appears in the [[English language]] in various [[figures of speech]] that imply guaranteed negative reprisal, such as: \"[[wikt:get what's coming to one|you got what was coming to you]]\", \"[[wikt:what goes around comes around|what goes around comes around]]\", \"[[wikt:chickens come home to roost|chickens come home to roost]]\", \"everything happens for a reason\", and \"[[wikt:reap what one sows|you reap what you sow]]\".

J.|location=New York|publisher=Plenum}}</ref> The desire to understand the processes that caused these phenomena led Lerner to conduct his first experiments on what is now called the just-world hypothesis.\n\n==Early evidence==\nIn 1966, Lerner and his colleagues began a series of experiments that used shock paradigms to investigate observer responses to [[victimization]]. In the first of these experiments conducted at the [[University of Kansas]], 72 female participants watched what appeared to be a confederate receiving electrical shocks under a variety of conditions. Initially, these observing participants were upset by the victim's apparent suffering. But as the suffering continued and observers remained unable to intervene, the observers began to reject and devalue the victim. Rejection and devaluation of the victim was greater when the observed suffering was greater. But when participants were told the victim would receive compensation for her suffering, the participants did not derogate the victim.<ref name=\"LernerSimmonsObserver\" /> Lerner and colleagues replicated these findings in subsequent studies, as did other researchers.<ref name=\"LernerMillerLooking\" />\n\n==Theory==\nTo explain these studies' findings, Lerner theorized that there was a prevalent belief in a just world. A just world is one in which actions and conditions have predictable, appropriate consequences. These actions and conditions are typically individuals' behaviors or attributes. The specific conditions that correspond to certain consequences are socially determined by a society's norms and ideologies. Lerner presents the belief in a just world as functional: it maintains the idea that one can influence the world in a predictable way. Belief in a just world functions as a sort of \"contract\" with the world regarding the consequences of behavior. This allows people to plan for the future and engage in effective, goal-driven behavior. Lerner summarized his findings and his theoretical work in his 1980 monograph ''The Belief in a Just World: A Fundamental Delusion''.<ref name=\"LernerFundamental\" />\n\nLerner hypothesized that the belief in a just world is crucially important for people to maintain for their own well-being. But people are confronted daily with evidence that the world is not just: people suffer without apparent cause. Lerner explained that people use strategies to eliminate threats to their belief in a just world. These strategies can be [[Rationality|rational]] or irrational. Rational strategies include accepting the reality of injustice, trying to prevent injustice or provide restitution, and accepting one's own limitations. Non-rational strategies include [[denial]], [[Social withdrawal|withdrawal]], and [[Rationalization (making excuses)|reinterpretation]] of the event.<ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511499975.008|chapter = Helping and Rationalization as Alternative Strategies for Restoring the Belief in a Just World: Evidence from Longitudinal Change Analyses|title = The Justice Motive in Everyday Life|pages = 127\u2013148|year = 2002|last1 = Reichle|first1 = Barbara|last2 = Schmitt|first2 = Manfred|isbn = 9780511499975|editor-last=Ross |editor-first=Michael |editor-last2=Miller |editor-first2=Dale T. |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> \n\nThere are a few modes of reinterpretation that could make an event fit the belief in a just world. One can reinterpret the outcome, the cause, and/or the character of the victim.  In the case of observing the injustice of the suffering of innocent people, one major way to rearrange the cognition of an event is to interpret the victim of suffering as deserving.<ref name=\"An Overview\" /> Specifically, observers can blame victims for their suffering on the basis of their behaviors and/or their characteristics.<ref name=\"LernerMillerLooking\" /> Much psychological research on the belief in a just world has focused on these negative social phenomena of [[victim blaming]] and victim derogation in [[#Additional evidence|different contexts]].<ref name=\"Furnham2003Decade\" />\n\nAn additional effect of this thinking is that individuals experience less personal [[vulnerability]] because they do not believe they have done anything to deserve or cause negative outcomes.<ref name=\"Furnham2003Decade\" /> This is related to the [[self-serving bias]] observed by social psychologists.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FCdQlTzL-aUC |title = Embitterment: Societal, psychological, and clinical perspectives|isbn = 9783211997413|last1 = Linden|first1 = Michael|last2 = Maercker|first2 = Andreas|date = 2011|location=Wien|publisher=Springer}}</ref>\n\nMany researchers have interpreted just-world beliefs as an example of [[causal attribution]]. In victim blaming, the causes of victimization are attributed to an individual rather than to a situation. Thus, the consequences of belief in a just world may be related to or explained in terms of particular patterns of causal attribution.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.3.494 |title = Societal influences on attribution: Blaming some victims more than others|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume = 47|issue = 3|pages = 494\u2013505|year = 1984|last1 = Howard|first1 = Judith A.}}</ref>\n\n==Alternatives==\n\n===Veridical judgment===\n{{See also|Veridicality}}\nOthers have suggested alternative explanations for the derogation of victims. One suggestion is that derogation effects are based on accurate judgments of a victim's character. In particular, in relation to Lerner's first studies, some have hypothesized that it would be logical for observers to derogate an individual who would allow himself to be shocked without reason.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/h0076786 |title = Devaluation of innocent victims: An attribution analysis within the just world paradigm|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume = 31|issue = 5|pages = 944\u2013951|year = 1975|last1 = Godfrey|first1 = Bruce W.|last2 = Lowe|first2 = Charles A.}}</ref> A subsequent study by Lerner challenged this alternative hypothesis by showing that individuals are only derogated when they actually suffer; individuals who agreed to undergo suffering but did not were viewed positively.<ref>Lerner, M.J. (1970). The desire for justice and reactions to victims. In J. Macaulay & L. Berkowitz (Eds.), ''Altruism and helping behavior'' (pp. 205\u2013229). New York: Academic Press.</ref>\n\n===Guilt reduction===\nAnother alternative explanation offered for the derogation of victims early in the development of the just-world hypothesis was that observers derogate victims to reduce their own feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Observers may feel [[Moral responsibility|responsible]], or guilty, for a victim's suffering if they themselves are involved in the situation or experiment. In order to reduce the guilt, they may devalue the victim.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/h0044214 |pmid = 13720212|title = Changes in interpersonal perception as a means of reducing cognitive dissonance|journal = The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume = 61|issue = 3|pages = 402\u2013410|year = 1960|last1 = Davis|first1 = Keith E.|last2 = Jones|first2 = Edward E.|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b99153d1428be3bc352ded10335cedc420fb84eb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1964.tb01357.x |pmid = 14238983|title = Changes in liking as a means of reducing cognitive discrepancies between self-esteem and aggression|journal = Journal of Personality|volume = 32|issue = 4|pages = 531\u2013549|year = 1964|last1 = Glass|first1 = David C.|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/37b14d60470b29c030ac7f116cf422e97475a1c6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.33.6.719 |title = Victim derogation in the Lerner paradigm: Just world or just justification?|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume = 33|issue = 6|pages = 719\u2013724|year = 1976|last1 = Cialdini|first1 = Robert B.|last2 = Kenrick|first2 = Douglas T.|last3 = Hoerig|first3 = James H.}}</ref> Lerner and colleagues claim that there has not been adequate evidence to support this interpretation. They conducted one study that found derogation of victims occurred even by observers who were not implicated in the process of the experiment and thus had no reason to feel guilty.<ref name=\"LernerMillerLooking\" />\n\n===Discomfort reduction===\n\nAlternatively, victim derogation and other strategies may only be ways to alleviate discomfort after viewing suffering. This would mean that the primary motivation is not to restore a belief in a just world, but to reduce discomfort caused by [[empathy|empathizing]].  Studies have shown that victim derogation does not suppress subsequent helping activity and that empathizing with the victim plays a large role when assigning blame. According to [[Ervin Staub]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Staub|first1=Ervin|title=Positive Social Behavior and Morality: Social and Personal Influences, Volume 1|date=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc.|isbn=978-0-12-663101-2|pages=169\u2013170|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GiOLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA169&lpg=PA169&q=reduce%20discomfort%20suffering%20erwin%20just%20world}}</ref> devaluing the victim should lead to lesser compensation if restoring belief in a just world was the primary motive; instead, there is virtually no difference in compensation amounts whether the compensation precedes or follows devaluation. [[Psychopathy]] has been linked to the lack of just-world maintaining strategies, possibly due to dampened emotional reactions and lack of empathy.<ref name=\"Hafer2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Hafer |first1=Carolyn L. |last2=B\u00e8gue |first2=Laurent |last3=Choma |first3=Becky L. |last4=Dempsey |first4=Julie L. |title=Belief in a Just World and Commitment to Long-Term Deserved Outcomes |journal=Social Justice Research |date=2005 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=429\u2013444 |doi=10.1007/s11211-005-8569-3 |url=http://www.lps.univ-savoie.fr/uploads/PDF/576.pdf  |citeseerx=10.1.1.507.4227 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228091123/http://www.lps.univ-savoie.fr/uploads/PDF/576.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-28 }}</ref>\n\n==Additional evidence==\nAfter Lerner's first studies, other researchers replicated these findings in other settings in which individuals are victimized. This work, which began in the 1970s and continues today, has investigated how observers react to victims of random calamities like traffic accidents, as well as rape and [[domestic violence]], illnesses, and poverty.<ref name=\"An Overview\" /> Generally, researchers have found that observers of the suffering of innocent victims tend to both derogate and blame victims for their suffering. Observers thus maintain their belief in a just world by changing their cognitions about the victims' character.<ref>{{Cite book | doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-6418-5_4 | chapter=How do Observers of Victimization Preserve Their Belief in a Just World Cognitively or Actionally?| title=Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World| pages=55\u201364| series=Critical Issues in Social Justice| year=1998| last1=Reichle| first1=Barbara| last2=Schneider| first2=Angela| last3=Montada| first3=Leo| isbn=978-1-4419-3306-5|editor-last1= Montada|editor-first1=L.|editor-last2= Lerner |editor-first2=M.

In a formative experiment on rape and belief in a just world by Linda Carli and colleagues, researchers gave two groups of subjects a narrative about interactions between a man and a woman. The description of the interaction was the same until the end; one group received a narrative that had a neutral ending and the other group received a narrative that ended with the man raping the woman. Subjects judged the rape ending as inevitable and blamed the woman in the narrative for the rape on the basis of her behavior, but not her characteristics.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/0022-1031(85)90013-7 |title = Cognitive biases in blaming the victim|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume = 21|issue = 2|pages = 161\u2013177|year = 1985|last1 = Janoff-Bulman|first1 = Ronnie|last2 = Timko|first2 = Christine|last3 = Carli|first3 = Linda L.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223081344}}</ref> These findings have been replicated repeatedly, including using a rape ending and a 'happy ending' (a marriage proposal).<ref name=\"Furnham2003Decade\" /><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/01461672992511005 |title = Cognitive Reconstruction, Hindsight, and Reactions to Victims and Perpetrators|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume = 25|issue = 8|pages = 966\u2013979|year = 1999|last1 = Carli|first1 = Linda L.|citeseerx = 10.1.1.830.8628}}</ref>\n\nOther researchers have found a similar phenomenon for judgments of [[domestic violence|battered partners]].

J.|location=New York|publisher=Plenum}}</ref> The desire to understand the processes that caused these phenomena led Lerner to conduct his first experiments on what is now called the just-world hypothesis.\n\n==Early evidence==\nIn 1966, Lerner and his colleagues began a series of experiments that used shock paradigms to investigate observer responses to [[victimization]]. In the first of these experiments conducted at the [[University of Kansas]], 72 female participants watched what appeared to be a confederate receiving electrical shocks under a variety of conditions. Initially, these observing participants were upset by the victim's apparent suffering. But as the suffering continued and observers remained unable to intervene, the observers began to reject and devalue the victim. Rejection and devaluation of the victim was greater when the observed suffering was greater. But when participants were told the victim would receive compensation for her suffering, the participants did not derogate the victim.<ref name=\"LernerSimmonsObserver\" /> Lerner and colleagues replicated these findings in subsequent studies, as did other researchers.<ref name=\"LernerMillerLooking\" />\n\n==Theory==\nTo explain these studies' findings, Lerner theorized that there was a prevalent belief in a just world. A just world is one in which actions and conditions have predictable, appropriate consequences. These actions and conditions are typically individuals' behaviors or attributes. The specific conditions that correspond to certain consequences are socially determined by a society's norms and ideologies. Lerner presents the belief in a just world as functional: it maintains the idea that one can influence the world in a predictable way. Belief in a just world functions as a sort of \"contract\" with the world regarding the consequences of behavior. This allows people to plan for the future and engage in effective, goal-driven behavior. Lerner summarized his findings and his theoretical work in his 1980 monograph ''The Belief in a Just World: A Fundamental Delusion''.<ref name=\"LernerFundamental\" />\n\nLerner hypothesized that the belief in a just world is crucially important for people to maintain for their own well-being. But people are confronted daily with evidence that the world is not just: people suffer without apparent cause. Lerner explained that people use strategies to eliminate threats to their belief in a just world. These strategies can be [[Rationality|rational]] or irrational. Rational strategies include accepting the reality of injustice, trying to prevent injustice or provide restitution, and accepting one's own limitations. Non-rational strategies include [[denial]], [[Social withdrawal|withdrawal]], and [[Rationalization (making excuses)|reinterpretation]] of the event.<ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1017/CBO9780511499975.008|chapter = Helping and Rationalization as Alternative Strategies for Restoring the Belief in a Just World: Evidence from Longitudinal Change Analyses|title = The Justice Motive in Everyday Life|pages = 127\u2013148|year = 2002|last1 = Reichle|first1 = Barbara|last2 = Schmitt|first2 = Manfred|isbn = 9780511499975|editor-last=Ross |editor-first=Michael |editor-last2=Miller |editor-first2=Dale T. |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> \n\nThere are a few modes of reinterpretation that could make an event fit the belief in a just world. One can reinterpret the outcome, the cause, and/or the character of the victim.  In the case of observing the injustice of the suffering of innocent people, one major way to rearrange the cognition of an event is to interpret the victim of suffering as deserving.<ref name=\"An Overview\" /> Specifically, observers can blame victims for their suffering on the basis of their behaviors and/or their characteristics.<ref name=\"LernerMillerLooking\" /> Much psychological research on the belief in a just world has focused on these negative social phenomena of [[victim blaming]] and victim derogation in [[#Additional evidence|different contexts]].<ref name=\"Furnham2003Decade\" />\n\nAn additional effect of this thinking is that individuals experience less personal [[vulnerability]] because they do not believe they have done anything to deserve or cause negative outcomes.<ref name=\"Furnham2003Decade\" /> This is related to the [[self-serving bias]] observed by social psychologists.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FCdQlTzL-aUC |title = Embitterment: Societal, psychological, and clinical perspectives|isbn = 9783211997413|last1 = Linden|first1 = Michael|last2 = Maercker|first2 = Andreas|date = 2011|location=Wien|publisher=Springer}}</ref>\n\nMany researchers have interpreted just-world beliefs as an example of [[causal attribution]]. In victim blaming, the causes of victimization are attributed to an individual rather than to a situation. Thus, the consequences of belief in a just world may be related to or explained in terms of particular patterns of causal attribution.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.3.494 |title = Societal influences on attribution: Blaming some victims more than others|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume = 47|issue = 3|pages = 494\u2013505|year = 1984|last1 = Howard|first1 = Judith A.}}</ref>\n\n==Alternatives==\n\n===Veridical judgment===\n{{See also|Veridicality}}\nOthers have suggested alternative explanations for the derogation of victims. One suggestion is that derogation effects are based on accurate judgments of a victim's character. In particular, in relation to Lerner's first studies, some have hypothesized that it would be logical for observers to derogate an individual who would allow himself to be shocked without reason.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/h0076786 |title = Devaluation of innocent victims: An attribution analysis within the just world paradigm|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume = 31|issue = 5|pages = 944\u2013951|year = 1975|last1 = Godfrey|first1 = Bruce W.|last2 = Lowe|first2 = Charles A.}}</ref> A subsequent study by Lerner challenged this alternative hypothesis by showing that individuals are only derogated when they actually suffer; individuals who agreed to undergo suffering but did not were viewed positively.<ref>Lerner, M.J. (1970). The desire for justice and reactions to victims. In J. Macaulay & L. Berkowitz (Eds.), ''Altruism and helping behavior'' (pp. 205\u2013229). New York: Academic Press.</ref>\n\n===Guilt reduction===\nAnother alternative explanation offered for the derogation of victims early in the development of the just-world hypothesis was that observers derogate victims to reduce their own feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Observers may feel [[Moral responsibility|responsible]], or guilty, for a victim's suffering if they themselves are involved in the situation or experiment. In order to reduce the guilt, they may devalue the victim.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/h0044214 |pmid = 13720212|title = Changes in interpersonal perception as a means of reducing cognitive dissonance|journal = The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume = 61|issue = 3|pages = 402\u2013410|year = 1960|last1 = Davis|first1 = Keith E.|last2 = Jones|first2 = Edward E.|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b99153d1428be3bc352ded10335cedc420fb84eb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1964.tb01357.x |pmid = 14238983|title = Changes in liking as a means of reducing cognitive discrepancies between self-esteem and aggression|journal = Journal of Personality|volume = 32|issue = 4|pages = 531\u2013549|year = 1964|last1 = Glass|first1 = David C.|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/37b14d60470b29c030ac7f116cf422e97475a1c6}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.33.6.719 |title = Victim derogation in the Lerner paradigm: Just world or just justification?|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume = 33|issue = 6|pages = 719\u2013724|year = 1976|last1 = Cialdini|first1 = Robert B.|last2 = Kenrick|first2 = Douglas T.|last3 = Hoerig|first3 = James H.}}</ref> Lerner and colleagues claim that there has not been adequate evidence to support this interpretation. They conducted one study that found derogation of victims occurred even by observers who were not implicated in the process of the experiment and thus had no reason to feel guilty.<ref name=\"LernerMillerLooking\" />\n\n===Discomfort reduction===\n\nAlternatively, victim derogation and other strategies may only be ways to alleviate discomfort after viewing suffering. This would mean that the primary motivation is not to restore a belief in a just world, but to reduce discomfort caused by [[empathy|empathizing]].  Studies have shown that victim derogation does not suppress subsequent helping activity and that empathizing with the victim plays a large role when assigning blame. According to [[Ervin Staub]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Staub|first1=Ervin|title=Positive Social Behavior and Morality: Social and Personal Influences, Volume 1|date=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc.|isbn=978-0-12-663101-2|pages=169\u2013170|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GiOLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA169&lpg=PA169&q=reduce%20discomfort%20suffering%20erwin%20just%20world}}</ref> devaluing the victim should lead to lesser compensation if restoring belief in a just world was the primary motive; instead, there is virtually no difference in compensation amounts whether the compensation precedes or follows devaluation. [[Psychopathy]] has been linked to the lack of just-world maintaining strategies, possibly due to dampened emotional reactions and lack of empathy.<ref name=\"Hafer2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Hafer |first1=Carolyn L. |last2=B\u00e8gue |first2=Laurent |last3=Choma |first3=Becky L. |last4=Dempsey |first4=Julie L. |title=Belief in a Just World and Commitment to Long-Term Deserved Outcomes |journal=Social Justice Research |date=2005 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=429\u2013444 |doi=10.1007/s11211-005-8569-3 |url=http://www.lps.univ-savoie.fr/uploads/PDF/576.pdf  |citeseerx=10.1.1.507.4227 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228091123/http://www.lps.univ-savoie.fr/uploads/PDF/576.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-28 }}</ref>\n\n==Additional evidence==\nAfter Lerner's first studies, other researchers replicated these findings in other settings in which individuals are victimized. This work, which began in the 1970s and continues today, has investigated how observers react to victims of random calamities like traffic accidents, as well as rape and [[domestic violence]], illnesses, and poverty.<ref name=\"An Overview\" /> Generally, researchers have found that observers of the suffering of innocent victims tend to both derogate and blame victims for their suffering.

In a formative experiment on rape and belief in a just world by Linda Carli and colleagues, researchers gave two groups of subjects a narrative about interactions between a man and a woman. The description of the interaction was the same until the end; one group received a narrative that had a neutral ending and the other group received a narrative that ended with the man raping the woman. Subjects judged the rape ending as inevitable and blamed the woman in the narrative for the rape on the basis of her behavior, but not her characteristics.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/0022-1031(85)90013-7 |title = Cognitive biases in blaming the victim|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume = 21|issue = 2|pages = 161\u2013177|year = 1985|last1 = Janoff-Bulman|first1 = Ronnie|last2 = Timko|first2 = Christine|last3 = Carli|first3 = Linda L.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223081344}}</ref> These findings have been replicated repeatedly, including using a rape ending and a 'happy ending' (a marriage proposal).<ref name=\"Furnham2003Decade\" /><ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/01461672992511005 |title = Cognitive Reconstruction, Hindsight, and Reactions to Victims and Perpetrators|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume = 25|issue = 8|pages = 966\u2013979|year = 1999|last1 = Carli|first1 = Linda L.|citeseerx = 10.1.1.830.8628}}</ref>\n\nOther researchers have found a similar phenomenon for judgments of [[domestic violence|battered partners]].

He went on to state that \"Working on Jack has been a project that felt just as creative and expansive as any creator-owned work I've done.

Some time after the events of episode LII, Jack travels through a desert to find a [[hermit]] living in a cave, whom he inquires for a way to return to his own time.  The hermit reveals that Aku learned his mastery of [[time travel]] through an ancient relic known as the Rope of Eons. He studied it, and absorbed its power before destroying it, so others couldn't learn its secrets, although it was possible for one to use the Rope once again if its strands were recovered and assembled together again.  Jack embarks on many quests to reassemble the Rope, only to discover that the last strand was in Aku's possession.  After Jack fights Aku and manages to take the last strand, Aku responds with a fierce attack that mortally wounds Jack, who is then given a choice to either fully sacrifice the Rope's power to undo the fatal blow, or die.  Jack chooses the former, unwilling to lose to Aku, but is forced to escape without accomplishing his goal.\n\nAfter the Rope was lost, Jack reunites with the Scotsman, only to confront a series of supernatural threats, such as the gender-bending curse of the leprechauns, a villain who can manipulate gravity and an attack on his samurai mentality and focus from Aku himself.  He later makes another bid to return to his own time by performing a magic ritual that involved a seer using the spirit of his sword to create a time travel portal, but this backfires and breaks the weapon, leaving Jack unarmed and vulnerable.  When Aku learns of the loss of Jack's sword, he stops at nothing to try and finish off Jack by any means necessary, but Jack manages to escape, stay hidden and survive without his weapon.\n\n===Quantum Jack===\nIn 2017, months after the series was revived and finished with the fifth season, IDW Publishing released a new 5-issue miniseries called \"Quantum Jack,\" which depicts Samurai Jack hopping from one dimension to the next, searching for a way back to his original form as his honor and pride push him forward back to his own time to face Aku one last time. The first issue depicts Jack as the leader of a ruthless biker gang that ambushes a royal convoy. The second issue depicts Jack as a masked luchador. The third issue depicts Jack in a world ruled by monsters known as Krogo, where he teams up with a group of scientists that control a giant battle robot as Jack slowly starts to regain his memory. The fourth issue depicts Jack as a businessman working in a cubicle working for Aku. The fifth and final issue finally reveals how and why Jack has been stranded in time as he makes one last gambit to return to his own time. This series was ultimately collected into a trade paperback.\n\n===Lost Worlds===\nIn 2019, IDW Publishing released a new 4-issue miniseries called \"Lost Worlds,\" which depicts Samurai Jack emerging from his hermetic life to discover a town ruled by a doppelganger of himself, who's determined to conquer the world and spread Jack's philosophies, teachings and beliefs, however, the two Jacks quickly clash as the true nature of the doppelganger is revealed.\n\n==Issues==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" border=\"2\" width=\"100%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ ''Samurai Jack: Tale of The Wandering Warrior'' comics overview\n|-  style=\"background:#980d26; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Issue No.\n! style=\"width:210px;\"|Issue Title\n! style=\"width:400px;\"|Overview\n! style=\"width:125px;\"|Release Date\n|-\n| 1||Samurai Jack and the Threads of Time||Jack is stranded in a strange future ruled by the demonic wizard, Aku.

Some time after the events of episode LII, Jack travels through a desert to find a [[hermit]] living in a cave, whom he inquires for a way to return to his own time.  The hermit reveals that Aku learned his mastery of [[time travel]] through an ancient relic known as the Rope of Eons. He studied it, and absorbed its power before destroying it, so others couldn't learn its secrets, although it was possible for one to use the Rope once again if its strands were recovered and assembled together again.  Jack embarks on many quests to reassemble the Rope, only to discover that the last strand was in Aku's possession.  After Jack fights Aku and manages to take the last strand, Aku responds with a fierce attack that mortally wounds Jack, who is then given a choice to either fully sacrifice the Rope's power to undo the fatal blow, or die.  Jack chooses the former, unwilling to lose to Aku, but is forced to escape without accomplishing his goal.\n\nAfter the Rope was lost, Jack reunites with the Scotsman, only to confront a series of supernatural threats, such as the gender-bending curse of the leprechauns, a villain who can manipulate gravity and an attack on his samurai mentality and focus from Aku himself.  He later makes another bid to return to his own time by performing a magic ritual that involved a seer using the spirit of his sword to create a time travel portal, but this backfires and breaks the weapon, leaving Jack unarmed and vulnerable.  When Aku learns of the loss of Jack's sword, he stops at nothing to try and finish off Jack by any means necessary, but Jack manages to escape, stay hidden and survive without his weapon.\n\n===Quantum Jack===\nIn 2017, months after the series was revived and finished with the fifth season, IDW Publishing released a new 5-issue miniseries called \"Quantum Jack,\" which depicts Samurai Jack hopping from one dimension to the next, searching for a way back to his original form as his honor and pride push him forward back to his own time to face Aku one last time. The first issue depicts Jack as the leader of a ruthless biker gang that ambushes a royal convoy. The second issue depicts Jack as a masked luchador. The third issue depicts Jack in a world ruled by monsters known as Krogo, where he teams up with a group of scientists that control a giant battle robot as Jack slowly starts to regain his memory. The fourth issue depicts Jack as a businessman working in a cubicle working for Aku. The fifth and final issue finally reveals how and why Jack has been stranded in time as he makes one last gambit to return to his own time. This series was ultimately collected into a trade paperback.\n\n===Lost Worlds===\nIn 2019, IDW Publishing released a new 4-issue miniseries called \"Lost Worlds,\" which depicts Samurai Jack emerging from his hermetic life to discover a town ruled by a doppelganger of himself, who's determined to conquer the world and spread Jack's philosophies, teachings and beliefs, however, the two Jacks quickly clash as the true nature of the doppelganger is revealed.\n\n==Issues==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" border=\"2\" width=\"100%\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ ''Samurai Jack: Tale of The Wandering Warrior'' comics overview\n|-  style=\"background:#980d26; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Issue No.\n! style=\"width:210px;\"|Issue Title\n! style=\"width:400px;\"|Overview\n! style=\"width:125px;\"|Release Date\n|-\n| 1||Samurai Jack and the Threads of Time||Jack is stranded in a strange future ruled by the demonic wizard, Aku.

The 136-page collection focuses on Jack's origin story and was released November 12, 2013. Simply put, Aku the demon wizard has enslaved Jack's people. Jack inherits a mystical katana and beats Aku in battle only to be sent far into the future where Aku's grip is all-reaching and all-powerful. Thus starts Jack's quest to journey back to his original time so he may finish what he and Aku started. The rest consists of short tales of Jack liberating others from Aku's hold, before passing along to the next town in true drifter style.<ref>[http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2013/11/comic-book-review-samurai-jack-classics.html] Samurai Jack: Classic Volumes (review on Flickering Myths)</ref> The artwork for the Classic Volumes is done by Ricardo Garcia Fuentes (commonly known as Micro), who also illustrated Jack in the [[Cartoon Network: Action Packs]] comic.<ref>[http://www.comicartfans.com/searchresult.asp?txtsearch=ricardo+garcia-fuentes Comicartfans.com] ''Ricardo Garcia Fuentes'' | Accessed: 2014-02-08</ref> Volume 2 of the Classic Volumes was officially released on April 22, 2014.<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samurai-Jack-Classics-Volume-2/dp/1613779372/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_3 Samurai Jack: Classic Volumes 2] on [[Amazon.co.uk|Amazon]]</ref>\n\n===''Cartoon Network: Super Secret Crisis War!''===\nSamurai Jack appears in the IDW Publishing crossover event between all of their Cartoon Network-owned properties, \"Super Secret Crisis War!\", which includes [[Ben 10: Omniverse]], [[Dexter's Laboratory]], [[The Powerpuff Girls]], [[Ed, Edd n Eddy]], [[Johnny Bravo]], [[Cow and Chicken]], [[Codename: Kids Next Door]], [[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]], and [[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]].
