Sherk attempted to take Penn down only once (in the first round), instead the fighters traded punches and leg kicks for the remainder of the fight. Penn landed jabs several times, utilizing his reach advantage over Sherk. In the closing seconds of the third round, Penn threw a punch and a hook that backed Sherk into the cage.

Sherk went down and Penn continued with strikes, but the round ended before the referee stopped the fight. However, Sherk was unable to continue and Penn was declared the victor by TKO (strikes).

To prevent an opportunity for the fighters to have Vaseline applied illicitly, fighters now must first part from any company, have Vaseline applied by the cut man, be checked by the referee, and then go directly to the cage. Finally, no cornermen will be allowed to have Vaseline in the cage between rounds.

Penn looked noticeably in better physical shape than his previous outings at 155&nbsp;lbs and negated any sort of takedown offense from Florian the entire match despite his opponent's persistence in grappling and engaging the clinch.\n\nOn his feet, Penn avoided virtually any damage, constantly stuffing or evading any attempts of a left high kick, punches, or elbows from Florian when the two departed from the clinch. In a measured performance, Penn preferred to pace himself in his standup, occasionally showing explosive bursts of striking up until the fourth round, where he executed a powerful takedown and quickly assumed the [[half guard]] position, punishing the contender with elbows until gaining the [[full mount]], where punches followed to continue the [[ground and pound]] assault from the [[BJJ]] specialist.\n\nA scramble ensued, where Florian gave up his back twice but was unable to escape Penn's mount, the second time Penn took his opponent's back, he looked to trap Florian's arm with one of his legs, but was unable to do so, instead striking the liver of Florian with his heel, which eventually led Penn to secure a [[rear naked choke]] at 3:45 of the fourth round to defend his lightweight championship title.\n\nPenn fought [[Diego Sanchez]] for the [[UFC Lightweight Championship]] on December 12, 2009 at ''[[UFC 107]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmafrenzy.com/11471/bj-penn-vs-diego-sanchez-now-slated-for-ufc-107-on-december-12-in-memphis/ |title=BJ Penn vs. Diego Sanchez Now Slated for UFC 107 on December 12 in Memphis |publisher=MMAFrenzy.com |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}</ref> Penn negated virtually any offense from the contender, exercising good footwork and elusive head movement whilst remaining flawless in his takedown defense on 27 attempts from Sanchez. He stalked his opponent for large periods of the match and stunned Sanchez early, dropping him; following up with multiple clean shots, which Sanchez showed good durability in weathering. Penn, showing good conditioning for the duration of the bout, continued to stuff all takedowns, punches and left high kicks from Sanchez and dominated with aggressive bursts of striking throughout. He hurt Sanchez several times, until finally rocking him with a flurry in the final round, swarming to finish the combo with a right high kick. The kick opened up a huge cut on Sanchez's forehead above his left eye, causing the fight to be halted on doctor's advice at 2:47 of the fifth round with a TKO. The victory marked only the second fight in UFC history to end in the fifth round, and also earned Penn the distinction of being the only man to have stopped Sanchez.\n\n{{quote|That right there, ladies and gentlemen, is the greatest lightweight, in the history of the sport!|[[Joe Rogan]], post fight at [[UFC 107]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.profighting-fans.com/articles/bj-penn-greatest_070910.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207201015/http://profighting-fans.com/articles/bj-penn-greatest_070910.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-02-07 |title=BJ Penn: The Greatest Lightweight in the History of the Sport |publisher=ProFighting-fans.com |last=Nelson |first=Jake }}</ref>}}\n\nThe performance marked the third time Penn had successfully finished a fight in defending his UFC Lightweight Championship, setting a new record of lightweight title defenses, by breaking the previous record of two defenses by [[Jens Pulver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Penn-Dominates-Finishes-Sanchez-at-UFC-107-21501|title=Penn Dominates, Finishes Sanchez at UFC 107|publisher=sherdog.com |date=December 12, 2009}}</ref> Later during the post-fight press conference UFC President Dana White told the media he was proud of Penn's willingness to take MMA more seriously in his training when earlier he felt Penn had coasted through the UFC solely on natural talent.<ref name=\"Dana White Proud\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiveknuckles.com/mma-news/Dana-White-proud-of-new-BJ-Penn.html|title=Dana White proud of new BJ Penn|publisher=FiveKnuckles.com|accessdate=December 13, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217095349/http://www.fiveknuckles.com/mma-news/Dana-White-proud-of-new-BJ-Penn.html|archivedate=December 17, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><br>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BJPenn2.png|right|thumb|200px|Penn in November 2008.]] -->\n\n====Losing the title====\nPenn's next defense was on April 10, 2010 at ''[[UFC 112]]'' against [[Frankie Edgar]].

Sherk attempted to take Penn down only once (in the first round), instead the fighters traded punches and leg kicks for the remainder of the fight. Penn landed jabs several times, utilizing his reach advantage over Sherk. In the closing seconds of the third round, Penn threw a punch and a hook that backed Sherk into the cage. Sherk then ducked under another punch \u2013 possibly to shoot for a takedown \u2013 when he was hit in the head by a flush flying left knee from Penn. Sherk went down and Penn continued with strikes, but the round ended before the referee stopped the fight. However, Sherk was unable to continue and Penn was declared the victor by TKO (strikes).

To prevent an opportunity for the fighters to have Vaseline applied illicitly, fighters now must first part from any company, have Vaseline applied by the cut man, be checked by the referee, and then go directly to the cage.

Penn looked noticeably in better physical shape than his previous outings at 155&nbsp;lbs and negated any sort of takedown offense from Florian the entire match despite his opponent's persistence in grappling and engaging the clinch.\n\nOn his feet, Penn avoided virtually any damage, constantly stuffing or evading any attempts of a left high kick, punches, or elbows from Florian when the two departed from the clinch. In a measured performance, Penn preferred to pace himself in his standup, occasionally showing explosive bursts of striking up until the fourth round, where he executed a powerful takedown and quickly assumed the [[half guard]] position, punishing the contender with elbows until gaining the [[full mount]], where punches followed to continue the [[ground and pound]] assault from the [[BJJ]] specialist.\n\nA scramble ensued, where Florian gave up his back twice but was unable to escape Penn's mount, the second time Penn took his opponent's back, he looked to trap Florian's arm with one of his legs, but was unable to do so, instead striking the liver of Florian with his heel, which eventually led Penn to secure a [[rear naked choke]] at 3:45 of the fourth round to defend his lightweight championship title.\n\nPenn fought [[Diego Sanchez]] for the [[UFC Lightweight Championship]] on December 12, 2009 at ''[[UFC 107]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmafrenzy.com/11471/bj-penn-vs-diego-sanchez-now-slated-for-ufc-107-on-december-12-in-memphis/ |title=BJ Penn vs. Diego Sanchez Now Slated for UFC 107 on December 12 in Memphis |publisher=MMAFrenzy.com |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=September 3, 2009}}</ref> Penn negated virtually any offense from the contender, exercising good footwork and elusive head movement whilst remaining flawless in his takedown defense on 27 attempts from Sanchez. He stalked his opponent for large periods of the match and stunned Sanchez early, dropping him; following up with multiple clean shots, which Sanchez showed good durability in weathering. Penn, showing good conditioning for the duration of the bout, continued to stuff all takedowns, punches and left high kicks from Sanchez and dominated with aggressive bursts of striking throughout. He hurt Sanchez several times, until finally rocking him with a flurry in the final round, swarming to finish the combo with a right high kick. The kick opened up a huge cut on Sanchez's forehead above his left eye, causing the fight to be halted on doctor's advice at 2:47 of the fifth round with a TKO. The victory marked only the second fight in UFC history to end in the fifth round, and also earned Penn the distinction of being the only man to have stopped Sanchez.\n\n{{quote|That right there, ladies and gentlemen, is the greatest lightweight, in the history of the sport!|[[Joe Rogan]], post fight at [[UFC 107]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.profighting-fans.com/articles/bj-penn-greatest_070910.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207201015/http://profighting-fans.com/articles/bj-penn-greatest_070910.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-02-07 |title=BJ Penn: The Greatest Lightweight in the History of the Sport |publisher=ProFighting-fans.com |last=Nelson |first=Jake }}</ref>}}\n\nThe performance marked the third time Penn had successfully finished a fight in defending his UFC Lightweight Championship, setting a new record of lightweight title defenses, by breaking the previous record of two defenses by [[Jens Pulver]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Penn-Dominates-Finishes-Sanchez-at-UFC-107-21501|title=Penn Dominates, Finishes Sanchez at UFC 107|publisher=sherdog.com |date=December 12, 2009}}</ref> Later during the post-fight press conference UFC President Dana White told the media he was proud of Penn's willingness to take MMA more seriously in his training when earlier he felt Penn had coasted through the UFC solely on natural talent.<ref name=\"Dana White Proud\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiveknuckles.com/mma-news/Dana-White-proud-of-new-BJ-Penn.html|title=Dana White proud of new BJ Penn|publisher=FiveKnuckles.com|accessdate=December 13, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217095349/http://www.fiveknuckles.com/mma-news/Dana-White-proud-of-new-BJ-Penn.html|archivedate=December 17, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><br>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BJPenn2.png|right|thumb|200px|Penn in November 2008.]] -->\n\n====Losing the title====\nPenn's next defense was on April 10, 2010 at ''[[UFC 112]]'' against [[Frankie Edgar]].

[[Shorthand|Shorthand notation]]s include [[tildes]] and [[Macron (diacritic)|straight line]]s placed respectively, below or above the name of a vector.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a ''vector'' was coined by [[W. R. Hamilton]] about 1843 as he revealed [[quaternion]]s, a system using vectors and scalars to span a four-dimensional space. For a quaternion ''q'' = ''a'' + ''b''i + ''c''j + ''d''k, Hamilton used two projections: '''S''' ''q'' = ''a'', for the scalar part of ''q'', and '''V''' ''q'' = ''b''i + ''c''j + ''d''k, the vector part. Using the modern terms ''cross product'' (\u00d7) and ''dot product'' (.), the ''quaternion product'' of two vectors ''p'' and ''q'' can be written ''pq'' = \u2013''p''.''q'' + ''p''\u00d7''q''. In 1878 [[W. K. Clifford]] severed the two products to make the quaternion operation useful for students in his textbook ''[[Elements of Dynamic]]''. Lecturing at [[Yale University]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] supplied notation for the [[scalar product]] and [[vector product]]s, which was introduced in ''[[Vector Analysis (Gibbs/Wilson)|Vector Analysis]]''.<ref>[[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]] (1901) [https://archive.org/details/117714283 Vector Analysis, based on the Lectures of J. W. Gibbs] at [[Internet Archive]]</ref> \n\nIn 1891 [[Oliver Heaviside]] argued for [[Clarendon (typeface)|Clarendon]] to distinguish vectors from scalars. He criticized the use of [[Greek letters]] by Tait and [[Fraktur|Gothic letters]] by Maxwell.<ref>[[Oliver Heaviside]], ''The Electrical Journal'', Volume 28. James Gray, 1891.

Shaw contributed his \"Comparative Notation for Vector Expressions\" to the ''Bulletin'' of the [[Quaternion Society]].<ref>J.B. Shaw (1912) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498&view=1up&seq=410 Comparative Notation for Vector Expressions], ''Bulletin'' of the [[Quaternion Society]] via [[Hathi Trust]].</ref> Subsequently, [[Alexander Macfarlane]] described 15 criteria for clear expression with vectors in the same publication.<ref>[[Alexander Macfarlane]] (1912) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000052363498;view=1up;seq=426 A System of Notation for Vector-Analysis; with a Discussion of the Underlying Principles] from ''Bulletin of the Quaternion Society''</ref>\n\nVector ideas were advanced by [[Hermann Grassmann]] in 1841 and again in 1862 in the [[German language]]. But German mathematicians were not taken with quaternions as much as were English-speaking mathematicians. When [[Felix Klein]] was organizing the [[Klein's encyclopedia|German mathematical encyclopedia]], he assigned [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] to standardize vector notation.<ref>[[Karin Reich]] (1995) [http://www.kk.s.bw.schule.de/mathge/mehm2.htm Die Rolle Arnold Sommerfeld bei der Diskussion um die Vektorrechnung]</ref> In 1950, when [[Academic Press]] published G. Kuerti\u2019s translation of the second edition of volume 2 of ''Lectures on Theoretical Physics'' by Sommerfeld, vector notation was the subject of a footnote: \"In the original German text, vectors ''and'' their components are printed in the same Gothic types. The more usual way of making a typographical distinction between the two has been adopted for this translation.\"<ref>{{Google books|L6RmDAAAQBAJ|Mechanics of Deformable Bodies|page=10}}</ref>\n\n==Rectangular vectors==\n[[File:Rectangle Geometry Vector.svg|thumb|Rectangle]]\n[[File:Cuboid simple.svg|thumb|Rectangular cuboid]]\nA rectangular vector is a [[coordinate vector]] specified by components that define a [[rectangle]] (or [[rectangular prism]] in three dimensions, and similar shapes in greater dimensions).  The starting point and terminal point of the vector lie at opposite ends of the rectangle (or prism, etc.).\n\n===Ordered set notation===\nA rectangular vector in [[real coordinate space|<math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>]] can be specified using an ordered [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of components, enclosed in either parentheses or angle brackets.\n\nIn a general sense, an ''n''-dimensional vector '''v''' can be specified in either of the following forms:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{n - 1}, v_n)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\langle v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{n - 1}, v_n \\rangle</math>\n\nWhere ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''v''<sub>''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1</sub>, ''v''<sub>''n''</sub> are the components of '''v'''.\n\n===Matrix notation===\nA rectangular vector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> can also be specified as a row or column [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] containing the ordered set of components.  A vector specified as a row matrix is known as a [[row vector]]; one specified as a column matrix is known as a [[column vector]].\n\nAgain, an ''n''-dimensional vector <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math> can be specified in either of the following forms using matrices:\n\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} v_1 & v_2 & \\cdots & v_{n - 1} & v_n \\end{matrix} \\right] = \\left( \\begin{matrix} v_1 & v_2 & \\cdots & v_{n - 1} & v_n \\end{matrix} \\right)</math>\n*<math>\\boldsymbol{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{n - 1} \\\\ v_n \\end{matrix} \\right]= \\left( \\begin{matrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_{n - 1} \\\\ v_n \\end{matrix} \\right)</math>\n\nWhere ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, ''v''<sub>''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1</sub>, ''v''<sub>''n''</sub> are the components of '''v'''. In some advanced contexts, a row and a column vector have different meaning; see [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]].\n\n===Unit vector notation===\nA rectangular vector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> (or fewer dimensions, such as <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math> where ''v''<sub>''z''</sub> below is zero) can be specified as the sum of the scalar multiples of the components of the vector with the members of the standard [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>.  The basis is represented with the [[unit vector]]s <math>\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}} = (1, 0, 0)</math>, <math>\\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\jmath}} = (0, 1, 0)</math>, and <math>\\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}} = (0, 0, 1)</math>.\n\nA three-dimensional vector '''v''' can be specified in the following form, using unit vector notation:\n\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = v_x \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\imath}} + v_y \\boldsymbol{\\hat{\\jmath}} + v_z \\boldsymbol{\\hat{k}}</math>\n\nWhere ''v''<sub>''x''</sub>, ''v''<sub>''y''</sub>, and ''v''<sub>''z''</sub> are the scalar components of '''v'''.  Scalar components may be positive or negative; the absolute value of a scalar component is a magnitude.\n\n==Polar vectors==\n{{distinguish|text=[[Polar vector]], a true vector, in a context where pseudo vectors or axial vectors are considered}} \n[[Image:CircularCoordinates.svg|thumb|250px|Points in the polar coordinate system with pole ''O'' and polar axis ''L''. In green, the point with radial coordinate 3 and angular coordinate 60 degrees, or (3,60\u00b0). In blue, the point (4,210\u00b0).]]\nThe two [[polar coordinates]] of a point in a plane may be considered as a two dimensional vector. Such a \n''polar vector'' consists of a [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] (or length) and a direction (or angle). The magnitude, typically represented as ''r'', is the distance from a starting point, the [[origin (geometry)|origin]], to the point which is represented. The angle, typically represented as ''\u03b8'' (the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter [[theta]]), is the angle, usually measured {{shy|counter|clockwise}}, between a fixed direction, typically that of the positive ''x''-axis, and the direction from the origin to the point. The angle is typically reduced to lie within the range <math>0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi</math> radians or <math>0 \\le \\theta < 360^{\\circ}</math>.\n\nIt must be emphasized that a ''polar vector'' is not really a [[vector (mathematics)|vector]], since the [[addition]] of two polar vectors is not defined.\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nPolar vectors can be specified using either ordered pair notation (a subset of ordered set notation using only two components) or matrix notation, as with rectangular vectors.  In these forms, the first component of the vector is ''r'' (instead of ''v''<sub>1</sub>) and the second component is ''\u03b8'' (instead of ''v''<sub>2</sub>).  To differentiate polar vectors from rectangular vectors, the angle may be prefixed with the angle symbol, <math>\\angle</math>.\n\nA two-dimensional polar vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered pair or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = (r, \\angle \\theta)</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\langle r, \\angle \\theta \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r & \\angle \\theta \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} r \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''r'' is the magnitude, ''\u03b8'' is the angle, and the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>) is optional.\n\n===Direct notation===\nPolar vectors can also be specified using simplified autonomous equations that define ''r'' and ''\u03b8'' explicitly.  This can be unwieldy, but is useful for avoiding the confusion with two-dimensional rectangular vectors that arises from using ordered pair or matrix notation.\n\nA two-dimensional vector whose magnitude is 5 units and whose direction is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0) can be specified using either of the following forms:\n\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}</math>\n*<math>r=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}</math>\n\n==Cylindrical vectors==\n[[Image:Coord system CY 1.svg|thumb|240px|A cylindrical coordinate system with origin ''O'', polar axis ''A'', and longitudinal axis ''L''.

It is akin to an arrow in the [[cylindrical coordinate system]].  A cylindrical vector is specified by a distance in the ''xy''-plane, an angle, and a distance from the ''xy''-plane (a height).  The first distance, usually represented as ''r'' or ''\u03c1'' (the Greek letter [[rho]]), is the magnitude of the projection of the vector onto the ''xy''-plane.  The angle, usually represented as ''\u03b8'' or ''\u03c6'' (the Greek letter [[phi]]), is measured as the offset from the line collinear with the ''x''-axis in the positive direction; the angle is typically reduced to lie within the range <math>0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi</math>.

It is akin to an arrow in the [[spherical coordinate system]].  A spherical vector is specified by a magnitude, an azimuth angle, and a zenith angle.  The magnitude is usually represented as ''\u03c1''.  The azimuth angle, usually represented as ''\u03b8'', is the ({{shy|counter|clockwise}}) offset from the positive ''x''-axis.

[[Normed vector space]]s also define an operation known as the [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] (or determination of magnitude). [[Inner product space]]s also define an operation known as the inner product.  In [[Real coordinate space|<math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>]], the inner product is known as the [[dot product]].  In <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> and <math>\\mathbb{R}^7</math>, an additional operation known as the [[cross product]] is also defined.\n\n===Vector addition===\n[[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|Vector addition]] is represented with the plus sign used as an operator between two vectors.  The sum of two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\n===Scalar multiplication===\n[[Scalar multiplication]] is represented in the same manners as algebraic multiplication.  A scalar beside a vector (either or both of which may be in parentheses) implies scalar multiplication.  The two common operators, a dot and a rotated cross, are also acceptable (although the rotated cross is almost never used), but they risk confusion with dot products and cross products, which operate on two vectors.  The product of a scalar ''c'' with a vector '''v''' can be represented in any of the following fashions:\n\n*<math>c \\mathbf{v}</math>\n*<math>c \\cdot \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\n====Vector subtraction and scalar division====\nUsing the algebraic properties of subtraction and division, along with scalar multiplication, it is also possible to \u201csubtract\u201d two vectors and \u201cdivide\u201d a vector by a scalar.\n\nVector subtraction is performed by adding the scalar multiple of \u22121 with the second vector operand to the first vector operand.  This can be represented by the use of the minus sign as an operator. The difference between two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' can be represented in either of the following fashions:\n\n*<math>\\mathbf{u} + -\\mathbf{v}</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nScalar division is performed by multiplying the vector operand with the numeric inverse of the scalar operand.  This can be represented by the use of the fraction bar or division signs as operators.  The quotient of a vector '''v''' and a scalar ''c'' can be represented in any of the following forms:\n\n*<math>{1 \\over c} \\mathbf{v}</math>\n*<math>{\\mathbf{v} \\over c}</math>\n*<math>{\\mathbf{v} \\div c}</math>\n\n===Norm===\nThe [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of a vector is represented with double bars on both sides of the vector.  The norm of a vector '''v''' can be represented as:\n:<math>\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|</math>\n\nThe norm is also sometimes represented with single bars, like <math>|\\mathbf{v}|</math>, but this can be confused with [[absolute value]] (which is a type of norm).\n\n===Inner product===\nThe [[inner product space|inner product]] (also known as the scalar product, not to be confused with scalar multiplication) of two vectors is represented as an ordered pair enclosed in angle brackets.  The inner product of two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\rangle</math>\n\n====Dot product====\nIn <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, the inner product is also known as the [[dot product]].  In addition to the standard inner product notation, the dot product notation (using the dot as an operator) can also be used (and is more common).  The dot product of two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' can be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nIn some older literature, the dot product is implied between two vectors written side-by-side. This notation can be confused with the [[dyadic product]] between two vectors.\n\n===Cross product===\nThe [[cross product]] of two vectors (in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>) is represented using the rotated cross as an operator.  The cross product of two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nBy some conventions (e.g. in France and some areas of higher mathematics) this is also denoted by a wedge,<ref>{{cite book |last=Cajori |first=Florian |title=A History of Mathematical Notations |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2011 |page=134 (Vol. 2) |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_byqAAAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA134}}</ref> which avoids confusion with the [[wedge product]] since the two are functionally equivalent in three dimensions:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} \\wedge \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nIn some older literature, the following notation is used for the cross product between '''u''' and '''v''':\n\n:<math>[\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}]</math>\n\n==Nabla==\n{{main|Del|Nabla symbol}}\nVector notation is used with [[calculus]] through the '''Nabla operator''':\n:<math> \\mathbf{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\mathbf{j}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\mathbf{k}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}</math>\nWith a scalar function ''f'', the [[gradient]] is expressed <math>\\nabla f \\ ,</math>\n\nwith a vector field, ''F'' the [[ divergence]] is expressed <math>\\nabla \\cdot F ,</math>\n\nand with a vector field, ''F'' the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] is expressed <math>\\nabla \\times F .</math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[ISO 31-11#Vectors and tensors]]\n* [[Phasor]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Linear algebra}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vector Notation}}\n[[Category:Mathematical notation]]\n[[Category:Vectors (mathematics and physics)]]\n", "text_old": "{|align=right style=\"clear:right;\"\n|-\n! style=\"color:#black; background:#dddddd; font-size:100%; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|Vector notation\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nImage:vector from A to B.svg|Vector arrow<br /><small>Pointing from ''A'' to ''B''</small>\nFile:Vector components.svg|[[Vector component]]s<br /><small>Describing an arrow vector '''v''' by its coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' yields an [[isomorphism]] of vector spaces.</small>\n</gallery>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Dot Product.svg|[[Scalar product]]<br /><small>Two equal-length sequences of coordinate vectors and returns a single number</small>\nImage:Cross product vector.svg|[[Vector product]]<br /><small>The cross-product in respect to a right-handed coordinate system</small>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\n'''Vector notation'''<ref>{{cite book |title=Principles and Applications of Mathematics for Communications-electronics |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yNUXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA123 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Notes on fundamentals of telephone transmission |publisher=American Telephone and Telegraph Company.

R. Hamilton]] about 1843 as he revealed [[quaternion]]s, a system using vectors and scalars to span a four-dimensional space. For a quaternion ''q'' = ''a'' + ''b''i + ''c''j + ''d''k, Hamilton used two projections: '''S''' ''q'' = ''a'', for the scalar part of ''q'', and '''V''' ''q'' = ''b''i + ''c''j + ''d''k, the vector part. Using the modern terms ''cross product'' (\u00d7) and ''dot product'' (.), the ''quaternion product'' of two vectors ''p'' and ''q'' can be written ''pq'' = \u2013''p''.''q'' + ''p''\u00d7''q''. In 1878 [[W. K. Clifford]] severed the two products to make the quaternion operation useful for students in his textbook ''[[Elements of Dynamic]]''. Lecturing at [[Yale University]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] supplied notation for the [[scalar product]] and [[vector product]]s, which was introduced in ''[[Vector Analysis (Gibbs/Wilson)|Vector Analysis]]''.<ref>[[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]] (1901) [https://archive.org/details/117714283 Vector Analysis, based on the Lectures of J. W. Gibbs] at [[Internet Archive]]</ref> \n\nIn 1891 [[Oliver Heaviside]] argued for [[Clarendon (typeface)|Clarendon]] to distinguish vectors from scalars. He criticized the use of [[Greek letters]] by Tait and [[Fraktur|Gothic letters]] by Maxwell.<ref>[[Oliver Heaviside]], ''The Electrical Journal'', Volume 28. James Gray, 1891.

It is akin to an arrow in the [[spherical coordinate system]].  A spherical vector is specified by a magnitude, an azimuth angle, and a zenith angle.  The magnitude is usually represented as ''\u03c1''.  The azimuth angle, usually represented as ''\u03b8'', is the ({{shy|counter|clockwise}}) offset from the positive ''x''-axis.  The zenith angle, usually represented as ''\u03c6'', is the offset from the positive ''z''-axis.  Both angles are typically reduced to lie within the range from zero (inclusive) to 2''\u03c0'' (exclusive).\n\n===Ordered set and matrix notations===\nSpherical vectors are specified like polar vectors, where the zenith angle is concatenated as a third component to form ordered triplets and matrices.  The azimuth and zenith angles may be both prefixed with the angle symbol (<math>\\angle</math>); the prefix should be used consistently to produce the distance-angle-angle combination that distinguishes spherical vectors from cylindrical ones.\n\nA three-dimensional spherical vector ''v'' can be represented as any of the following, using either ordered triplet or matrix notation:\n\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = (\\rho, \\angle \\theta, \\angle \\phi)</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\langle \\rho, \\angle \\theta, \\angle \\phi \\rangle</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} \\rho & \\angle \\theta & \\angle \\phi \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\left[ \\begin{matrix} \\rho \\\\ \\angle \\theta \\\\ \\angle \\phi \\end{matrix} \\right]</math>\n\nWhere ''\u03c1'' is the magnitude, ''\u03b8'' is the azimuth angle, and ''\u03c6'' is the zenith angle.\n\n===Direct notation===\nLike polar and cylindrical vectors, spherical vectors can be specified using simplified autonomous equations, in this case for ''\u03c1'', ''\u03b8'', and ''\u03c6''.\n\nA three-dimensional vector whose magnitude is 5 units, whose azimuth angle is ''\u03c0''/9 radians (20\u00b0), and whose zenith angle is ''\u03c0''/4 radians (45\u00b0) can be specified as:\n\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\theta={\\pi \\over 9}, \\  \\phi={\\pi \\over 4}</math>\n*<math>\\rho=5, \\  \\theta=20^{\\circ}, \\  \\phi=45^{\\circ}</math>\n\n==Operations==\nIn any given [[vector space]], the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined. [[Normed vector space]]s also define an operation known as the [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] (or determination of magnitude). [[Inner product space]]s also define an operation known as the inner product.  In [[Real coordinate space|<math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>]], the inner product is known as the [[dot product]].  In <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> and <math>\\mathbb{R}^7</math>, an additional operation known as the [[cross product]] is also defined.\n\n===Vector addition===\n[[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|Vector addition]] is represented with the plus sign used as an operator between two vectors.  The sum of two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\n===Scalar multiplication===\n[[Scalar multiplication]] is represented in the same manners as algebraic multiplication.  A scalar beside a vector (either or both of which may be in parentheses) implies scalar multiplication.  The two common operators, a dot and a rotated cross, are also acceptable (although the rotated cross is almost never used), but they risk confusion with dot products and cross products, which operate on two vectors.  The product of a scalar ''c'' with a vector '''v''' can be represented in any of the following fashions:\n\n*<math>c \\mathbf{v}</math>\n*<math>c \\cdot \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\n====Vector subtraction and scalar division====\nUsing the algebraic properties of subtraction and division, along with scalar multiplication, it is also possible to \u201csubtract\u201d two vectors and \u201cdivide\u201d a vector by a scalar.\n\nVector subtraction is performed by adding the scalar multiple of \u22121 with the second vector operand to the first vector operand.  This can be represented by the use of the minus sign as an operator. The difference between two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' can be represented in either of the following fashions:\n\n*<math>\\mathbf{u} + -\\mathbf{v}</math>\n*<math>\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nScalar division is performed by multiplying the vector operand with the numeric inverse of the scalar operand.  This can be represented by the use of the fraction bar or division signs as operators.  The quotient of a vector '''v''' and a scalar ''c'' can be represented in any of the following forms:\n\n*<math>{1 \\over c} \\mathbf{v}</math>\n*<math>{\\mathbf{v} \\over c}</math>\n*<math>{\\mathbf{v} \\div c}</math>\n\n===Norm===\nThe [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of a vector is represented with double bars on both sides of the vector.  The norm of a vector '''v''' can be represented as:\n:<math>\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|</math>\n\nThe norm is also sometimes represented with single bars, like <math>|\\mathbf{v}|</math>, but this can be confused with [[absolute value]] (which is a type of norm).\n\n===Inner product===\nThe [[inner product space|inner product]] (also known as the scalar product, not to be confused with scalar multiplication) of two vectors is represented as an ordered pair enclosed in angle brackets.  The inner product of two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\langle \\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\rangle</math>\n\n====Dot product====\nIn <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, the inner product is also known as the [[dot product]].  In addition to the standard inner product notation, the dot product notation (using the dot as an operator) can also be used (and is more common).  The dot product of two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' can be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nIn some older literature, the dot product is implied between two vectors written side-by-side. This notation can be confused with the [[dyadic product]] between two vectors.\n\n===Cross product===\nThe [[cross product]] of two vectors (in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>) is represented using the rotated cross as an operator.  The cross product of two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' would be represented as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nBy some conventions (e.g. in France and some areas of higher mathematics) this is also denoted by a wedge,<ref>{{cite book |last=Cajori |first=Florian |title=A History of Mathematical Notations |publisher=Dover Publications |date=2011 |page=134 (Vol. 2) |url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_byqAAAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA134}}</ref> which avoids confusion with the [[wedge product]] since the two are functionally equivalent in three dimensions:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} \\wedge \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nIn some older literature, the following notation is used for the cross product between '''u''' and '''v''':\n\n:<math>[\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{v}]</math>\n\n==Nabla==\n{{main|Del|Nabla symbol}}\nVector notation is used with [[calculus]] through the '''Nabla operator''':\n:<math> \\mathbf{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} + \\mathbf{j}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} + \\mathbf{k}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}</math>\nWith a scalar function ''f'', the [[gradient]] is expressed <math>\\nabla f \\ ,</math>\n\nwith a vector field, ''F'' the [[ divergence]] is expressed <math>\\nabla \\cdot F ,</math>\n\nand with a vector field, ''F'' the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] is expressed <math>\\nabla \\times F .</math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[ISO 31-11#Vectors and tensors]]\n* [[Phasor]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Linear algebra}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vector Notation}}\n[[Category:Mathematical notation]]\n[[Category:Vectors (mathematics and physics)]]\n", "name_user": "Skvery", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMatrix notation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_notation"}

He was also the presidential nominee of the left-wing [[Progressive Party 1948 (United States)|Progressive Party]] in the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]].\n\nThe oldest son of [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]], who served as the U.S. secretary of agriculture from 1921 to 1924, Henry A. Wallace was born in [[Adair County, Iowa]] in 1888. After graduating from [[Iowa State University]] in 1910, Wallace worked as a writer and editor for his family's farm journal, ''[[Wallace's Farmer]]''. He also founded the [[DuPont Pioneer|Hi-Bred Corn Company]], a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[corn]] company that eventually became extremely successful. Wallace displayed an intellectual curiosity about a wide array of subjects, including statistics and economics, and he explored various religious and spiritual movements, including [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. After the death of his father in 1924, Wallace increasingly drifted away from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and he supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nominee [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 election]].\n\nWallace served as Secretary of Agriculture under President Roosevelt from 1933 to 1940. He strongly supported Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] and presided over a major shift in federal agricultural policy, implementing measures designed to curtail agricultural surpluses and ameliorate rural poverty. Overcoming strong opposition from conservative party leaders, Wallace was nominated for Vice President at the [[1940 Democratic National Convention]]. The Democratic ticket of Roosevelt and Wallace triumphed in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]], and Wallace continued to play an important role in the Roosevelt administration before and during [[World War II]]. At the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]], conservative party leaders defeated Wallace's bid for re-nomination, replacing him on the Democratic ticket with [[Harry S. Truman]]. The ticket of Roosevelt and Truman won the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 presidential election]], and in early 1945 Roosevelt appointed Wallace as Secretary of Commerce.\n\nRoosevelt died in April 1945 and was succeeded by Truman. Wallace continued to serve as secretary of commerce until September 1946, when Truman fired him for delivering a speech urging conciliatory policies towards the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Henry_Wallace.htm |website=Senate.gov |title=Henry Agard Wallace, 33rd Vice President (1941-1945) |publisher=Senate Historical Office |date=2017-05-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325001919/https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Henry_Wallace.htm |archivedate=2019-03-25 |accessdate=2019-03-25 }}</ref> Wallace and his supporters established the Progressive Party and launched a [[third party (United States)|third-party]] campaign for president.

Accusations of [[Communism|Communist]] influences and Wallace's association with controversial Theosophist figure [[Nicholas Roerich]] undermined his campaign, and he received just 2.4 percent of the nationwide popular vote. Wallace broke with the Progressive Party in 1950 over the [[Korean War]], and in 1952 he published ''Where I Was Wrong'', in which he declared the Soviet Union to be \"utterly evil.\" Wallace largely fell into political obscurity after the early 1950s, though he continued to make public appearances until the year before his death in 1965.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nWallace was born on October 7, 1888 on a farm near [[Orient, Iowa]], to [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]] and his wife, May.<ref>Southwick (1998), p. 620</ref> Wallace had two younger brothers and three younger sisters.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 23\u201324</ref> His paternal grandfather, \"Uncle Henry\" Wallace, was an important landowner, newspaper editor, and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] activist, and [[Social Gospel]] advocate in [[Adair County, Iowa]]. Uncle Henry's father, John Wallace, was an [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Ulster Scots immigrant]] from the village [[Kilrea]] in [[County Londonderry]], [[Ireland]] who arrived in [[Philadelphia]] in 1823.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 3\u201310</ref> May (n\u00e9e Broadhead) was born in [[New York City]] but was raised by an aunt in [[Muscatine, Iowa]] after the death of her parents.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nWallace's family moved to [[Ames, Iowa]], in 1892 and to [[Des Moines, Iowa]], in 1896. In 1894, the Wallaces established an agricultural newspaper known as ''[[Wallace's Farmer]]''.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 11\u201317</ref> The newspaper became extremely successful and made the Wallace family wealthy and politically influential.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 21\u201322</ref> Wallace took a strong interest in agriculture and plants from a young age, and he befriended [[African-American]] botanist [[George Washington Carver]], with whom he frequently talked about plants and other subjects.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 13\u201314</ref> Wallace was particularly interested in [[corn]], the key crop in Iowa. In 1904, he devised an experiment that disproved agronomist [[Perry Greeley Holden]]'s assertion that the most aesthetically pleasing corn would produce the greatest yield.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 26\u201329</ref> Wallace graduated from West High School in 1906 and enrolled in [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]] later that year, majoring in animal husbandry. He joined the Hawkeye Club, a fraternal organization, and spent much of his free time continuing his study of corn.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 29\u201334</ref> He also organized a political club in support of [[Gifford Pinchot]], a [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive]] Republican who served as the head of the [[United States Forest Service]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), p. 37</ref>\n\n==Journalist and farmer==\n[[File:H. C. Wallace (retouched).jpg|thumb|Wallace's father, [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]], served as secretary of agriculture from 1921 to his death in 1924.]]\n\nWallace became a full-time writer and editor for the family-owned paper, ''Wallace's Farmer'', after he graduated college in 1910. He was deeply interested in using mathematics and economics in agriculture, and he learned [[calculus]] as part of an effort to understand [[hog (swine)|hog]] prices.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 37\u201339</ref> He also wrote an influential article with pioneering statistician [[George W. Snedecor]] on computational methods for [[correlation]]s and [[regression analysis|regressions]]<ref>{{Cite journal |first1 = Henry Agard |last1 = Wallace |first2 = George Waddel |last2 = Snedecor |title = Correlation and Machine Calculation |journal = Iowa State College Bulletin |volume = 35 |year = 1925 }}</ref> After the death of his grandfather in 1916, Wallace became the co-editor of ''Wallace's Farmer'' alongside his father.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), p. 42\u201344</ref> In 1921, Wallace assumed leadership of the family paper after his father accepted appointment as [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|secretary of agriculture]] under President [[Warren G. Harding]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 53\u201355</ref> His uncle lost ownership of the paper in 1932 due to the effects of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], and Wallace stopped serving as editor of the paper in 1933.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 92\u201393, 110</ref>\n\nIn 1914, Wallace and his wife purchased a farm near [[Johnston, Iowa]]; they initially attempted to combine corn production with dairy farming, but later turned their full attention to corn.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 40\u201341</ref> Influenced by [[Edward Murray East]], Wallace focused on the production of hybrid corn, developing a hybrid corn known as Copper Cross. In 1923, Wallace reached the first ever contract for hybrid seed production when he agreed to grant the Iowa Seed Company the sole right to grow and sell Copper Cross corn.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 67\u201370</ref> In 1926, he co-founded the [[Pioneer Hi-Bred|Hi-Bred Corn Company]] to develop and produce hybrid corn. Though it initially turned only a small profit, the Hi-Bred Corn Company eventually became a massive financial success.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 82\u201383</ref>\n\n==Early political involvement==\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Wallace and his father helped the [[United States Food Administration]] (USFA) to develop policies to increase hog production.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 46\u201348</ref> After USFA director [[Herbert Hoover]] abandoned the hog production policies favored by the Wallaces, the elder Wallace joined an effort to deny Hoover the presidential nomination at the [[1920 Republican National Convention]]. Partly as a response to Hoover, Wallace published ''Agricultural Prices'', in which he advocated government policies to control agricultural prices.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 50\u201352</ref> He also warned farmers of an imminent price collapse following the end of the war. Wallace's prediction proved accurate, as the postwar period saw the beginning of a farm crisis that extended into the 1920s. Reflecting a broader decrease in agricultural prices, the price of corn fell from $1.68 per bushel in 1918 to 42 cents per bushel in 1921.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 52\u201353</ref> Wallace proposed various remedies to combat the farm crisis, which he believed stemmed primarily from overproduction by farmers. Among his proposed policies was the \"[[ever-normal granary]],\" a policy under which the government buys and stores agricultural surpluses during periods of low agricultural prices and sells those surpluses during periods of high agricultural prices.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 56\u201359</ref>\n\nBoth Wallaces backed the [[McNary\u2013Haugen Farm Relief Bill]], which would have required the federal government to market and export agricultural surpluses in foreign markets. The bill was defeated in large part due to the opposition of President [[Calvin Coolidge]], who became president after President Harding's death in 1923.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 62\u201363</ref> Wallace's father died in October 1924, and in the November [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 presidential election]], Henry Wallace voted for [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive]] [[third party (United States)|third party]] candidate [[Robert La Follette]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 64\u201365, 71</ref> Partly due to Wallace's continued lobbying, Congress passed the McNary\u2013Haugen bill in 1927 and 1928, but President Coolidge vetoed the bill both times.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 84\u201385</ref> Dissatisfied with both major party candidates in the [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 presidential election]], Wallace tried to get Governor [[Frank Lowden]] of Illinois to seek the presidency. He ultimately supported Democratic nominee [[Al Smith]], but Republican Herbert Hoover won a landslide victory.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 86\u201387</ref> The onset of the Great Depression during [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|Hoover's administration]] devastated Iowa farmers as farm income fell by two-thirds from 1929 to 1932.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 99\u2013100</ref> In the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 presidential election]], Wallace campaigned for Democrat [[Franklin D.

Roosevelt}}\n\nAfter Roosevelt defeated Hoover in the 1932 presidential election, he appointed Wallace as secretary of agriculture.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 105\u2013107</ref> Despite his past affiliation with the Republican Party, Wallace strongly supported President Roosevelt and his [[New Deal]] domestic program, and he became a registered member of the Democratic Party in 1936.<ref>Kennedy (1999), p. 457</ref> Upon taking office, Wallace appointed [[Rexford Tugwell]], a member of Roosevelt's \"[[Brain Trust]]\" of important advisers, as his deputy secretary. Though Roosevelt was initially focused primarily on addressing the banking crisis, Wallace and Tugwell convinced the president of the necessity of quickly passing major agricultural reforms.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 113\u2013114</ref> Roosevelt, Wallace, and [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Agriculture Committee]] Chairman [[John Marvin Jones]] rallied congressional support around the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]], which established the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA).<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 115\u2013119</ref> The aim of the AAA was to raise prices for commodities through artificial scarcity by using a system of \"domestic allotments\" that set the total output of agricultural products. The AAA paid land owners subsidies for leaving some of their land idle.<ref>Ronald L. Heinemann, ''Depression and New Deal in Virginia.'' (1983) p. 107</ref> Farm incomes increased significantly in the first three years of the New Deal, as prices for commodities rose.<ref>Anthony Badger, ''The New Deal: The Depression Years, 1933\u20131940'' (2002) p. 89. 153-57</ref> After the passage of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the Department of Agriculture became the single largest department in the federal government.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 120\u2013122</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down the Agricultural Adjustment Act in the 1936 case of ''[[United States v. Butler]]''. Wallace strongly disagreed with the Court's holding that agriculture was a \"purely local activity\" and thus could not be regulated by the federal government, stating that \"were agriculture truly a local matter in 1936, as the Supreme Court says it is, half of the people of the United States would quickly starve.\"<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 157\u2013160</ref> Nonetheless, he quickly proposed a new agriculture program designed to meet the Supreme Court's objections; under the new program, the federal government would reach rental agreements with farmers to plant [[green manure]] rather than crops like corn and wheat. Less than two months after the Supreme Court handed down ''United States v. Butler'', Roosevelt signed the [[Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1936]] into law.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 160\u2013161</ref> In the [[1936 United States presidential election|1936 presidential election]], Wallace served as an important campaign surrogate for Roosevelt's successful re-election campaign.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 163\u2013167</ref>\n\nIn 1935, Wallace fired general counsel [[Jerome Frank]] and some other Agriculture Department officials who sought to help [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]] by issuing a reinterpretation of the Agricultural Adjustment Act.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 154\u2013157</ref> Wallace became more committed to aiding sharecroppers and other groups of impoverished farmers as a result of a trip to the South in late 1936, after which he wrote, \"I have never seen among the peasantry of Europe poverty so abject as that which exists in this favorable cotton year in the great cotton states.\" He helped lead passage of the [[Bankhead\u2013Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937]], which authorized the federal government to issue loans to tenant farmers so that they could purchase land and equipment. The law also established the [[Farm Security Administration]],{{efn|The Farm Security Administration succeeded the [[Resettlement Administration]], which had been an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency]].}} which was charged with ameliorating rural poverty, within the Agriculture Department.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 169\u2013171</ref> The failure of Roosevelt's [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937]], the onset of the [[Recession of 1937\u201338]], and a wave of strikes led by [[John L. Lewis]] badly damaged the Roosevelt administration's ability to pass major legislation after 1936.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 174\u2013176</ref> Nonetheless, Wallace helped lead passage of the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]], which implemented Wallace's ever-normal granary plan.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 178\u2013179</ref> Between 1932 and 1940, the Agriculture Department grew from 40,000 employees and an annual budget of $280 million to 146,000 employees and an annual budget of $1.5 billion.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), p. 237</ref>\n\nA Republican [[wave elections in the United States|wave]] in the [[1938 United States elections|1938 elections]] effectively brought an end to the New Deal legislative program, and foreign policy increasingly became the focus of the Roosevelt administration.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 185\u2013186, 192</ref> Unlike many Midwestern progressives, Wallace supported [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] policies, such as Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]]'s efforts to lower tariffs.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 191\u2013192</ref> He joined Roosevelt in attacking the aggressive actions of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Empire of Japan]], and in one speech derided [[Nazi eugenics]] as a \"mumbo-jumbo of dangerous nonsense.\"<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 193\u2013194</ref> After the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, Wallace supported Roosevelt's program of military build-up and, anticipating future hostilities with Germany, pushed for initiatives like a [[synthetic rubber]] program and closer relations with [[Latin American]] countries.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 206\u2013207</ref>\n\n==Vice President==\n===Election of 1940===\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1940.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.4|1940 electoral vote results]]\n\nAs Roosevelt refused to commit to either retiring or seeking re-election{{efn|The [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], ratified in 1951, would later prevent presidents from running for a third term.}} during his second term, supporters of Wallace and other leading Democrats such as Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and Postmaster General [[James Farley]] laid the groundwork for a presidential campaign in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 179\u2013180</ref> After the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe in September 1939, Wallace publicly endorsed a third term for Roosevelt.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 200\u2013201</ref> Though Roosevelt never declared his presidential candidacy, the [[1940 Democratic National Convention]] nominated him for president.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 213\u2013217</ref> Shortly after being nominated, Roosevelt informed his supporters that he favored Wallace for Vice President. Wallace had a strong base of support among farmers, had been a loyal lieutenant in both domestic and foreign policy, and, unlike some other high-ranking New Dealers like [[Harry Hopkins]], was in good health.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 209, 217\u2013218</ref> However, due to his liberal stances and former affiliation with the Republican Party, many conservative Democratic party leaders disliked Wallace.<ref>Kennedy (1999), pp. 457\u2013458</ref> Roosevelt convinced [[James F. Byrnes]], [[Paul V. McNutt]], and other contenders for the Democratic vice presidential nomination to support Wallace, but conservative Democrats rallied around the candidacy of Speaker of the House [[William B. Bankhead]] of Alabama. Eventually, Wallace gained the party's vice presidential nomination by a wide margin over Bankhead.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 218\u2013223</ref>\n\nThough many Democrats were disappointed by the nomination of Wallace, his selection was generally well-received by newspapers. [[Arthur Krock]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Wallace was \"able, thoughtful, honorable\u2013the best of the New Deal type.\"<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 223\u2013225</ref> Wallace left office as Secretary of Agriculture in September 1940, and was succeeded by Undersecretary of Agriculture [[Claude R.

Wallace was dispatched to the Midwest, giving speeches in states like Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri. He made foreign affairs the main focus of his campaigning, telling one audience that \"the replacement of Roosevelt ... would cause [Adolf] [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] to rejoice.\"<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 231\u2013236</ref> Although both campaigns predicted a close election, Roosevelt won 449 of the 531 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] and won the popular vote by a margin of nearly ten points.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 244\u2013245</ref> After the election, Wallace toured [[Mexico]] as a goodwill ambassador, delivering a well-received speech regarding [[Pan-Americanism]] and Roosevelt's [[Good Neighbor policy]].

In early 1942, Roosevelt established the [[War Production Board]] to coordinate war-time production, and named [[Donald Nelson]], rather than Wallace, as the head of the board. Wallace became a member of the War Production Board and continued to serve as head of the BEW, which was charged with procuring and protecting the natural resources necessary for war production.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 269\u2013271</ref> Wallace struggled to carve out authority for the BEW, clashing with both the State Department and the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC).<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 271\u2013273</ref> On May 8, 1942, Wallace delivered what became his best remembered speech, known for containing the phrase \"the Century of the Common Man\". He cast World War II as a war between a \"free world\" and a \"slave world,\" and held that \"peace must mean a better standard of living for the common man, not merely in the United States and England, but also in India, Russia, China, and Latin America\u2013not merely in the [[Allies of World War II|United Nations]], but also in Germany and Italy and Japan.\" Though some conservatives disliked the speech, it was translated into twenty languages, and millions of copies were distributed around the world.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 275\u2013279</ref>\n\nIn early 1943, Wallace was dispatched on a goodwill tour of Latin America; he made twenty-four stops across [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. Partly due to his ability to deliver speeches in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Wallace received a warm reception; one State Department official noted that \"never in [[Chile|Chilean]] history has any foreigner ever been received with such extravagance and evidently sincere enthusiasm.\" During his trip, several Latin American countries declared war against Germany.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 296\u2013300</ref> After a long, public battle between Wallace and RFC head [[Jesse H.

Roosevelt, hoping to mend ties with his popular vice president, offered Wallace any position in the Cabinet other than that of secretary of state, and Wallace asked to replace his old rival Jones as [[United States Secretary of Commerce|secretary of commerce]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 367\u2013373</ref> In that position, Wallace expected to play a key role in the postwar transition of the economy.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 379\u2013380</ref> In January 1945, with the end of Wallace's term as vice president, Roosevelt nominated Wallace for the position of secretary of commerce.<ref>Donovan (1977), p. 113</ref> Wallace's nomination prompted an intense debate as many senators objected to his support for liberal policies designed to boost wages and employment.<ref>Malsberger (2000), p. 131.</ref> Conservatives failed to block the nomination, but Senator [[Walter F.

With his congressional allies, he led passage of the [[Employment Act of 1946]]. Although conservatives blocked the inclusion of a measure providing for [[full employment]], the act established the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] and the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Economic Committee]] to study economic matters.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 395\u2013396</ref> Wallace's proposal to establish [[Baruch Plan|international control over nuclear weapons]] was not adopted, but he did help pass the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]], which established the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] to oversee domestic development of nuclear power.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 404\u2013406, 427</ref>\n\nWorld War II came to an end in September 1945 with the [[Surrender of Japan]], and relations with the Soviet Union became a central matter of foreign policy.

Though Wallace was not a member of the PCA, he was widely regarded as the organization's leader and was criticized for the PCA's acceptance of Communist members. In response to the creation of the PCA, anti-Communist liberals established a rival group, [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA), which explicitly rejected any association with Communism.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 433\u2013435</ref> Wallace strongly criticized the president in early 1947 after Truman promulgated the [[Truman Doctrine]] and issued [[Executive Order 9835]], which began a purge of government workers affiliated with political groups deemed to be subversive.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 436\u2013438</ref> He initially favored the [[Marshall Plan]], but later opposed it because he believed the program should have been administered through the United Nations.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 451\u2013453, 457</ref> Wallace and the PCA began receiving close scrutiny from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC), both of which sought to uncover evidence of Communist influence.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 446\u2013450</ref>\n\nMany in the PCA favored the establishment of a [[third party (United States)|third party]], but other long-time Wallace allies warned him against leaving the Democratic Party.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 452\u2013454</ref> On December 29, 1947, Wallace launched a third party campaign, declaring, \"we have assembled a [[Gideon]]'s Army, small in number, powerful in conviction ...

He was also the presidential nominee of the left-wing [[Progressive Party 1948 (United States)|Progressive Party]] in the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]].\n\nThe oldest son of [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]], who served as the U.S. secretary of agriculture from 1921 to 1924, Henry A. Wallace was born in [[Adair County, Iowa]] in 1888. After graduating from [[Iowa State University]] in 1910, Wallace worked as a writer and editor for his family's farm journal, ''[[Wallace's Farmer]]''. He also founded the [[DuPont Pioneer|Hi-Bred Corn Company]], a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[corn]] company that eventually became extremely successful. Wallace displayed an intellectual curiosity about a wide array of subjects, including statistics and economics, and he explored various religious and spiritual movements, including [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. After the death of his father in 1924, Wallace increasingly drifted away from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and he supported [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential nominee [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 election]].\n\nWallace served as Secretary of Agriculture under President Roosevelt from 1933 to 1940. He strongly supported Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] and presided over a major shift in federal agricultural policy, implementing measures designed to curtail agricultural surpluses and ameliorate rural poverty. Overcoming strong opposition from conservative party leaders, Wallace was nominated for Vice President at the [[1940 Democratic National Convention]]. The Democratic ticket of Roosevelt and Wallace triumphed in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 presidential election]], and Wallace continued to play an important role in the Roosevelt administration before and during [[World War II]]. At the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]], conservative party leaders defeated Wallace's bid for re-nomination, replacing him on the Democratic ticket with [[Harry S. Truman]]. The ticket of Roosevelt and Truman won the [[1944 United States presidential election|1944 presidential election]], and in early 1945 Roosevelt appointed Wallace as Secretary of Commerce.\n\nRoosevelt died in April 1945 and was succeeded by Truman. Wallace continued to serve as secretary of commerce until September 1946, when Truman fired him for delivering a speech urging conciliatory policies towards the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Henry_Wallace.htm |website=Senate.gov |title=Henry Agard Wallace, 33rd Vice President (1941-1945) |publisher=Senate Historical Office |date=2017-05-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325001919/https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Henry_Wallace.htm |archivedate=2019-03-25 |accessdate=2019-03-25 }}</ref> Wallace and his supporters established the Progressive Party and launched a [[third party (United States)|third-party]] campaign for president. The Progressive party platform called for conciliatory policies towards the Soviet Union, [[School integration in the United States|desegregation of public schools]], [[racial equality|racial]] and [[gender equality]], [[free trade]], a [[national health insurance]] program, and other left-wing policies. Accusations of [[Communism|Communist]] influences and Wallace's association with controversial Theosophist figure [[Nicholas Roerich]] undermined his campaign, and he received just 2.4 percent of the nationwide popular vote. Wallace broke with the Progressive Party in 1950 over the [[Korean War]], and in 1952 he published ''Where I Was Wrong'', in which he declared the Soviet Union to be \"utterly evil.\" Wallace largely fell into political obscurity after the early 1950s, though he continued to make public appearances until the year before his death in 1965.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nWallace was born on October 7, 1888 on a farm near [[Orient, Iowa]], to [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]] and his wife, May.<ref>Southwick (1998), p. 620</ref> Wallace had two younger brothers and three younger sisters.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 23\u201324</ref> His paternal grandfather, \"Uncle Henry\" Wallace, was an important landowner, newspaper editor, and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] activist, and [[Social Gospel]] advocate in [[Adair County, Iowa]]. Uncle Henry's father, John Wallace, was an [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Ulster Scots immigrant]] from the village [[Kilrea]] in [[County Londonderry]], [[Ireland]] who arrived in [[Philadelphia]] in 1823.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 3\u201310</ref> May (n\u00e9e Broadhead) was born in [[New York City]] but was raised by an aunt in [[Muscatine, Iowa]] after the death of her parents.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 9\u201310</ref>\n\nWallace's family moved to [[Ames, Iowa]], in 1892 and to [[Des Moines, Iowa]], in 1896. In 1894, the Wallaces established an agricultural newspaper known as ''[[Wallace's Farmer]]''.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 11\u201317</ref> The newspaper became extremely successful and made the Wallace family wealthy and politically influential.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 21\u201322</ref> Wallace took a strong interest in agriculture and plants from a young age, and he befriended [[African-American]] botanist [[George Washington Carver]], with whom he frequently talked about plants and other subjects.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 13\u201314</ref> Wallace was particularly interested in [[corn]], the key crop in Iowa. In 1904, he devised an experiment that disproved agronomist [[Perry Greeley Holden]]'s assertion that the most aesthetically pleasing corn would produce the greatest yield.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 26\u201329</ref> Wallace graduated from West High School in 1906 and enrolled in [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]] later that year, majoring in animal husbandry. He joined the Hawkeye Club, a fraternal organization, and spent much of his free time continuing his study of corn.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 29\u201334</ref> He also organized a political club in support of [[Gifford Pinchot]], a [[Progressivism in the United States|Progressive]] Republican who served as the head of the [[United States Forest Service]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), p. 37</ref>\n\n==Journalist and farmer==\n[[File:H. C. Wallace (retouched).jpg|thumb|Wallace's father, [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]], served as secretary of agriculture from 1921 to his death in 1924.]]\n\nWallace became a full-time writer and editor for the family-owned paper, ''Wallace's Farmer'', after he graduated college in 1910. He was deeply interested in using mathematics and economics in agriculture, and he learned [[calculus]] as part of an effort to understand [[hog (swine)|hog]] prices.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 37\u201339</ref> He also wrote an influential article with pioneering statistician [[George W. Snedecor]] on computational methods for [[correlation]]s and [[regression analysis|regressions]]<ref>{{Cite journal |first1 = Henry Agard |last1 = Wallace |first2 = George Waddel |last2 = Snedecor |title = Correlation and Machine Calculation |journal = Iowa State College Bulletin |volume = 35 |year = 1925 }}</ref> After the death of his grandfather in 1916, Wallace became the co-editor of ''Wallace's Farmer'' alongside his father.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), p. 42\u201344</ref> In 1921, Wallace assumed leadership of the family paper after his father accepted appointment as [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|secretary of agriculture]] under President [[Warren G. Harding]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 53\u201355</ref> His uncle lost ownership of the paper in 1932 due to the effects of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], and Wallace stopped serving as editor of the paper in 1933.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 92\u201393, 110</ref>\n\nIn 1914, Wallace and his wife purchased a farm near [[Johnston, Iowa]]; they initially attempted to combine corn production with dairy farming, but later turned their full attention to corn.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 40\u201341</ref> Influenced by [[Edward Murray East]], Wallace focused on the production of hybrid corn, developing a hybrid corn known as Copper Cross. In 1923, Wallace reached the first ever contract for hybrid seed production when he agreed to grant the Iowa Seed Company the sole right to grow and sell Copper Cross corn.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 67\u201370</ref> In 1926, he co-founded the [[Pioneer Hi-Bred|Hi-Bred Corn Company]] to develop and produce hybrid corn. Though it initially turned only a small profit, the Hi-Bred Corn Company eventually became a massive financial success.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 82\u201383</ref>\n\n==Early political involvement==\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Wallace and his father helped the [[United States Food Administration]] (USFA) to develop policies to increase hog production.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 46\u201348</ref> After USFA director [[Herbert Hoover]] abandoned the hog production policies favored by the Wallaces, the elder Wallace joined an effort to deny Hoover the presidential nomination at the [[1920 Republican National Convention]]. Partly as a response to Hoover, Wallace published ''Agricultural Prices'', in which he advocated government policies to control agricultural prices.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 50\u201352</ref> He also warned farmers of an imminent price collapse following the end of the war. Wallace's prediction proved accurate, as the postwar period saw the beginning of a farm crisis that extended into the 1920s. Reflecting a broader decrease in agricultural prices, the price of corn fell from $1.68 per bushel in 1918 to 42 cents per bushel in 1921.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 52\u201353</ref> Wallace proposed various remedies to combat the farm crisis, which he believed stemmed primarily from overproduction by farmers. Among his proposed policies was the \"[[ever-normal granary]],\" a policy under which the government buys and stores agricultural surpluses during periods of low agricultural prices and sells those surpluses during periods of high agricultural prices.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 56\u201359</ref>\n\nBoth Wallaces backed the [[McNary\u2013Haugen Farm Relief Bill]], which would have required the federal government to market and export agricultural surpluses in foreign markets. The bill was defeated in large part due to the opposition of President [[Calvin Coolidge]], who became president after President Harding's death in 1923.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 62\u201363</ref> Wallace's father died in October 1924, and in the November [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 presidential election]], Henry Wallace voted for [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive]] [[third party (United States)|third party]] candidate [[Robert La Follette]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 64\u201365, 71</ref> Partly due to Wallace's continued lobbying, Congress passed the McNary\u2013Haugen bill in 1927 and 1928, but President Coolidge vetoed the bill both times.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 84\u201385</ref> Dissatisfied with both major party candidates in the [[1928 United States presidential election|1928 presidential election]], Wallace tried to get Governor [[Frank Lowden]] of Illinois to seek the presidency. He ultimately supported Democratic nominee [[Al Smith]], but Republican Herbert Hoover won a landslide victory.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 86\u201387</ref> The onset of the Great Depression during [[Presidency of Herbert Hoover|Hoover's administration]] devastated Iowa farmers as farm income fell by two-thirds from 1929 to 1932.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 99\u2013100</ref> In the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 presidential election]], Wallace campaigned for Democrat [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who favored the agricultural policies of Wallace and economist [[M. L. Wilson]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 102\u2013104</ref>\n\n==Secretary of Agriculture==\n{{see also|First and second terms of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt}}\n\nAfter Roosevelt defeated Hoover in the 1932 presidential election, he appointed Wallace as secretary of agriculture.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 105\u2013107</ref> Despite his past affiliation with the Republican Party, Wallace strongly supported President Roosevelt and his [[New Deal]] domestic program, and he became a registered member of the Democratic Party in 1936.<ref>Kennedy (1999), p. 457</ref> Upon taking office, Wallace appointed [[Rexford Tugwell]], a member of Roosevelt's \"[[Brain Trust]]\" of important advisers, as his deputy secretary. Though Roosevelt was initially focused primarily on addressing the banking crisis, Wallace and Tugwell convinced the president of the necessity of quickly passing major agricultural reforms.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 113\u2013114</ref> Roosevelt, Wallace, and [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Agriculture Committee]] Chairman [[John Marvin Jones]] rallied congressional support around the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act]], which established the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA).<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 115\u2013119</ref> The aim of the AAA was to raise prices for commodities through artificial scarcity by using a system of \"domestic allotments\" that set the total output of agricultural products. The AAA paid land owners subsidies for leaving some of their land idle.<ref>Ronald L. Heinemann, ''Depression and New Deal in Virginia.'' (1983) p. 107</ref> Farm incomes increased significantly in the first three years of the New Deal, as prices for commodities rose.<ref>Anthony Badger, ''The New Deal: The Depression Years, 1933\u20131940'' (2002) p. 89. 153-57</ref> After the passage of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the Department of Agriculture became the single largest department in the federal government.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 120\u2013122</ref>\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down the Agricultural Adjustment Act in the 1936 case of ''[[United States v. Butler]]''. Wallace strongly disagreed with the Court's holding that agriculture was a \"purely local activity\" and thus could not be regulated by the federal government, stating that \"were agriculture truly a local matter in 1936, as the Supreme Court says it is, half of the people of the United States would quickly starve.\"<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 157\u2013160</ref> Nonetheless, he quickly proposed a new agriculture program designed to meet the Supreme Court's objections; under the new program, the federal government would reach rental agreements with farmers to plant [[green manure]] rather than crops like corn and wheat. Less than two months after the Supreme Court handed down ''United States v. Butler'', Roosevelt signed the [[Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act of 1936]] into law.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 160\u2013161</ref> In the [[1936 United States presidential election|1936 presidential election]], Wallace served as an important campaign surrogate for Roosevelt's successful re-election campaign.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 163\u2013167</ref>\n\nIn 1935, Wallace fired general counsel [[Jerome Frank]] and some other Agriculture Department officials who sought to help [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]] by issuing a reinterpretation of the Agricultural Adjustment Act.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 154\u2013157</ref> Wallace became more committed to aiding sharecroppers and other groups of impoverished farmers as a result of a trip to the South in late 1936, after which he wrote, \"I have never seen among the peasantry of Europe poverty so abject as that which exists in this favorable cotton year in the great cotton states.\" He helped lead passage of the [[Bankhead\u2013Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937]], which authorized the federal government to issue loans to tenant farmers so that they could purchase land and equipment. The law also established the [[Farm Security Administration]],{{efn|The Farm Security Administration succeeded the [[Resettlement Administration]], which had been an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency]].}} which was charged with ameliorating rural poverty, within the Agriculture Department.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 169\u2013171</ref> The failure of Roosevelt's [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937]], the onset of the [[Recession of 1937\u201338]], and a wave of strikes led by [[John L. Lewis]] badly damaged the Roosevelt administration's ability to pass major legislation after 1936.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 174\u2013176</ref> Nonetheless, Wallace helped lead passage of the [[Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938]], which implemented Wallace's ever-normal granary plan.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 178\u2013179</ref> Between 1932 and 1940, the Agriculture Department grew from 40,000 employees and an annual budget of $280 million to 146,000 employees and an annual budget of $1.5 billion.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), p. 237</ref>\n\nA Republican [[wave elections in the United States|wave]] in the [[1938 United States elections|1938 elections]] effectively brought an end to the New Deal legislative program, and foreign policy increasingly became the focus of the Roosevelt administration.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 185\u2013186, 192</ref> Unlike many Midwestern progressives, Wallace supported [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] policies, such as Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]]'s efforts to lower tariffs.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 191\u2013192</ref> He joined Roosevelt in attacking the aggressive actions of [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Empire of Japan]], and in one speech derided [[Nazi eugenics]] as a \"mumbo-jumbo of dangerous nonsense.\"<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 193\u2013194</ref> After the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, Wallace supported Roosevelt's program of military build-up and, anticipating future hostilities with Germany, pushed for initiatives like a [[synthetic rubber]] program and closer relations with [[Latin American]] countries.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 206\u2013207</ref>\n\n==Vice President==\n===Election of 1940===\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1940.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.4|1940 electoral vote results]]\n\nAs Roosevelt refused to commit to either retiring or seeking re-election{{efn|The [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]], ratified in 1951, would later prevent presidents from running for a third term.}} during his second term, supporters of Wallace and other leading Democrats such as Vice President [[John Nance Garner]] and Postmaster General [[James Farley]] laid the groundwork for a presidential campaign in the [[1940 United States presidential election|1940 election]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 179\u2013180</ref> After the outbreak of [[World War II]] in Europe in September 1939, Wallace publicly endorsed a third term for Roosevelt.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 200\u2013201</ref> Though Roosevelt never declared his presidential candidacy, the [[1940 Democratic National Convention]] nominated him for president.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 213\u2013217</ref> Shortly after being nominated, Roosevelt informed his supporters that he favored Wallace for Vice President. Wallace had a strong base of support among farmers, had been a loyal lieutenant in both domestic and foreign policy, and, unlike some other high-ranking New Dealers like [[Harry Hopkins]], was in good health.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 209, 217\u2013218</ref> However, due to his liberal stances and former affiliation with the Republican Party, many conservative Democratic party leaders disliked Wallace.<ref>Kennedy (1999), pp. 457\u2013458</ref> Roosevelt convinced [[James F. Byrnes]], [[Paul V. McNutt]], and other contenders for the Democratic vice presidential nomination to support Wallace, but conservative Democrats rallied around the candidacy of Speaker of the House [[William B. Bankhead]] of Alabama. Eventually, Wallace gained the party's vice presidential nomination by a wide margin over Bankhead.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 218\u2013223</ref>\n\nThough many Democrats were disappointed by the nomination of Wallace, his selection was generally well-received by newspapers. [[Arthur Krock]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Wallace was \"able, thoughtful, honorable\u2013the best of the New Deal type.\"<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 223\u2013225</ref> Wallace left office as Secretary of Agriculture in September 1940, and was succeeded by Undersecretary of Agriculture [[Claude R. Wickard]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 225\u2013226</ref> The Roosevelt campaign settled on a strategy of keeping Roosevelt largely out of the fray of the election, leaving most of the campaigning to Wallace and other surrogates. Wallace was dispatched to the Midwest, giving speeches in states like Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri. He made foreign affairs the main focus of his campaigning, telling one audience that \"the replacement of Roosevelt ... would cause [Adolf] [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] to rejoice.\"<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 231\u2013236</ref> Although both campaigns predicted a close election, Roosevelt won 449 of the 531 [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] and won the popular vote by a margin of nearly ten points.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 244\u2013245</ref> After the election, Wallace toured [[Mexico]] as a goodwill ambassador, delivering a well-received speech regarding [[Pan-Americanism]] and Roosevelt's [[Good Neighbor policy]]. On his return from the trip, Wallace convinced the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to establish an agricultural experiment center in Mexico, which would be the first of many such centers established by the Rockefeller Foundation and the [[Ford Foundation]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 246\u2013251</ref>{{efn|[[Norman Borlaug]] would later credit Wallace as a key initiator of the [[Green Revolution]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 250\u2013251</ref>}}\n\n===Tenure===\n{{see also|Third and fourth terms of the presidency of Franklin D.

In early 1942, Roosevelt established the [[War Production Board]] to coordinate war-time production, and named [[Donald Nelson]], rather than Wallace, as the head of the board. Wallace became a member of the War Production Board and continued to serve as head of the BEW, which was charged with procuring and protecting the natural resources necessary for war production.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 269\u2013271</ref> Wallace struggled to carve out authority for the BEW, clashing with both the State Department and the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC).<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 271\u2013273</ref> On May 8, 1942, Wallace delivered what became his best remembered speech, known for containing the phrase \"the Century of the Common Man\". He cast World War II as a war between a \"free world\" and a \"slave world,\" and held that \"peace must mean a better standard of living for the common man, not merely in the United States and England, but also in India, Russia, China, and Latin America\u2013not merely in the [[Allies of World War II|United Nations]], but also in Germany and Italy and Japan.\" Though some conservatives disliked the speech, it was translated into twenty languages, and millions of copies were distributed around the world.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 275\u2013279</ref>\n\nIn early 1943, Wallace was dispatched on a goodwill tour of Latin America; he made twenty-four stops across [[Central America]] and [[South America]]. Partly due to his ability to deliver speeches in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Wallace received a warm reception; one State Department official noted that \"never in [[Chile|Chilean]] history has any foreigner ever been received with such extravagance and evidently sincere enthusiasm.\" During his trip, several Latin American countries declared war against Germany.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 296\u2013300</ref> After a long, public battle between Wallace and RFC head [[Jesse H.

Nonetheless, Wallace got Roosevelt to send a public letter to the convention chairman in which he stated, \"I personally would vote for [Wallace's] renomination if I were a delegate to the convention.\"<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 345\u2013352</ref>\n\nWith Roosevelt not fully committed to keeping or dropping Wallace, the vice presidential balloting turned into a battle between those who favored Wallace and those who favored Truman.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 352\u2013353</ref> Wallace did not organize an effective organization in support of his candidacy, though allies like [[Calvin Benham Baldwin]], [[Claude Pepper]], and [[Joseph F.

Truman}}\n[[File:HenryAgardWallace.jpg|thumb|right|Secretary of Commerce Henry Wallace]]\n\nWallace believed that Democratic party leaders had unfairly stolen the vice presidential nomination from him, but he supported Roosevelt's ultimately successful campaign in the 1944 presidential election. Roosevelt, hoping to mend ties with his popular vice president, offered Wallace any position in the Cabinet other than that of secretary of state, and Wallace asked to replace his old rival Jones as [[United States Secretary of Commerce|secretary of commerce]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 367\u2013373</ref> In that position, Wallace expected to play a key role in the postwar transition of the economy.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 379\u2013380</ref> In January 1945, with the end of Wallace's term as vice president, Roosevelt nominated Wallace for the position of secretary of commerce.<ref>Donovan (1977), p. 113</ref> Wallace's nomination prompted an intense debate as many senators objected to his support for liberal policies designed to boost wages and employment.<ref>Malsberger (2000), p. 131.</ref> Conservatives failed to block the nomination, but Senator [[Walter F.

Ickes]] in February 1946, Wallace was the lone remaining holdover from Roosvelt's Cabinet.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), p. 411</ref>}} but he retained Wallace, who remained highly popular with liberal Democrats.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 388\u2013390</ref> The discontent of liberal leaders strengthened Wallace's position in the Cabinet; Truman privately stated that the two most important members of his \"political team\" were Wallace and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 408\u2013409</ref> As secretary of commerce, Wallace advocated a \"middle course\" between the [[planned economy]] of the Soviet Union and the [[laissez-faire]] economics that had dominated the United States prior to the Great Depression. With his congressional allies, he led passage of the [[Employment Act of 1946]]. Although conservatives blocked the inclusion of a measure providing for [[full employment]], the act established the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] and the [[United States Congress Joint Economic Committee|Joint Economic Committee]] to study economic matters.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 395\u2013396</ref> Wallace's proposal to establish [[Baruch Plan|international control over nuclear weapons]] was not adopted, but he did help pass the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]], which established the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] to oversee domestic development of nuclear power.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 404\u2013406, 427</ref>\n\nWorld War II came to an end in September 1945 with the [[Surrender of Japan]], and relations with the Soviet Union became a central matter of foreign policy. Various issues, including the fate of post-war governments in Europe and Asia and the administration of the [[United Nations]], had already begun to strain the wartime alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 396\u2013398</ref> Critics of the Soviet Union objected to the oppressive [[satellite state]]s that the Soviet Union established in [[Eastern Europe]] and Soviet involvement in the [[Greek Civil War]] and the [[Chinese Civil War]]. In February 1946, [[George F. Kennan]] laid out the doctrine of [[containment]], which called for the United States to resist the spread of Communism.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 411\u2013412</ref> Wallace feared that confrontational policies towards the Soviet Union would eventually lead to war, and he urged Truman to \"allay any reasonable Russian grounds for fear, suspicion, and distrust.\"<ref>Patterson (1996), p. 124</ref> Historian [[Tony Judt]] wrote in ''[[Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945|Postwar]]''that Wallace's \"distaste for American involvement with Britain and Europe was widely shared across the political spectrum.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Judt|first=Tony|title=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 |author-link=Tony Judt |publisher= The Penguin Press |year=2005 |page= 110|title-link=Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945}}</ref> \n\nThough Wallace was dissatisfied with Truman's increasingly confrontational policies towards the Soviet Union, he remained an integral part of Truman's Cabinet during the first half of 1946.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 409\u2013417</ref> Wallace broke with administration policies in September 1946 when he delivered a speech in which he stated that \"we should recognize that we have no more business in the political affairs of Eastern Europe than Russia has in the political affairs of Latin America, Western Europe and the United States.\" Though Wallace's speech was booed by the pro-Soviet Union crowd he delivered it to, it was even more strongly criticized by Truman administration officials and leading Republicans like [[Robert A. Taft]] and [[Arthur Vandenberg]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 420\u2013422</ref> Truman stated that Wallace's speech did not represent administration policy but merely Wallace's personal views, and on September 20 he demanded and received Wallace's resignation.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 422\u2013426</ref>\n\n==1948 presidential election==\n{{Further|Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Cold War|McCarthyism|Soviet espionage in the United States}}\n\nShortly after leaving office, Wallace became the editor of ''[[The New Republic]]'', a progressive magazine.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 431\u2013432</ref> He also helped establish the [[Progressive Citizens of America]] (PCA), a progressive political organization that accepted members regardless of race, creed, or political affiliation. Though Wallace was not a member of the PCA, he was widely regarded as the organization's leader and was criticized for the PCA's acceptance of Communist members. In response to the creation of the PCA, anti-Communist liberals established a rival group, [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA), which explicitly rejected any association with Communism.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 433\u2013435</ref> Wallace strongly criticized the president in early 1947 after Truman promulgated the [[Truman Doctrine]] and issued [[Executive Order 9835]], which began a purge of government workers affiliated with political groups deemed to be subversive.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 436\u2013438</ref> He initially favored the [[Marshall Plan]], but later opposed it because he believed the program should have been administered through the United Nations.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 451\u2013453, 457</ref> Wallace and the PCA began receiving close scrutiny from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC), both of which sought to uncover evidence of Communist influence.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 446\u2013450</ref>\n\nMany in the PCA favored the establishment of a [[third party (United States)|third party]], but other long-time Wallace allies warned him against leaving the Democratic Party.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 452\u2013454</ref> On December 29, 1947, Wallace launched a third party campaign, declaring, \"we have assembled a [[Gideon]]'s Army, small in number, powerful in conviction ... We face the future unfettered, unfettered by any principal but the general welfare.\"<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 456\u2013457</ref> He won backing from many intellectuals, union members, and military veterans; among his prominent supporters were Rexford Tugwell, Congressmen [[Vito Marcantonio]] and [[Leo Isacson]], musicians [[Paul Robeson]] and [[Pete Seeger]], and future presidential nominee [[George McGovern]].<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 481, 484\u2013485, 488</ref> Calvin Baldwin became Wallace's campaign manager and took charge of fundraising and ensuring that Wallace appeared on as many state ballots as possible.<ref>Culver & Hyde (2000), pp. 460\u2013461</ref> Wallace's first choice for running mate, Claude Pepper, refused to leave the Democratic Party, but Democratic Senator [[Glen H.
