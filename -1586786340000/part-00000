They lived throughout northeastern South America, [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Barbados]], the [[Windward Islands]], [[Dominica]], and possibly the southern [[Leeward Islands]]. Historically, it was thought their ancestors were mainland Caribs who had conquered the islands from their previous inhabitants, the [[Igneri]]. However, linguistic and archaeological evidence contradicts the notion of a mass emigration and conquest; the Island Carib language appears not to have been [[Cariban languages|Cariban]], but like that of their neighbors, the [[Ta\u00edno]]. Irving Rouse and others suggest that a smaller group of mainland Caribs conquered the islands without displacing their inhabitants, eventually adopting the local language but retaining their traditions of a South American origin.<ref>{{cite book |last= Rouse |first= Irving |date= 1992 |title= The Tainos |url= https://archive.org/details/tainosrisedeclin00rous |url-access= registration |quote= Island Carib. |location= |publisher= Yale University Press |page= [https://archive.org/details/tainosrisedeclin00rous/page/21 21] |isbn= 0300051816 |accessdate= May 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the early colonial period, the Caribs had a reputation as warriors who raided neighboring islands.

Some claim there is evidence as to the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both Carib and other Amerindian groups such as the [[Arawak]] and [[Tupinamb\u00e1 people|Tupinamba]]. Others argue Europeans misunderstood rituals, or falsely portrayed them to justify conquest and genocide. Today, the Caribs and their descendants continue to live in the Antilles, notably on the island of [[Dominica]]. The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] or \"[[Black Caribs]]\", a group of mixed Carib, Arawak and African ancestry, also live principally in Central America.\n\n==History==\nThe Caribs are believed to have migrated from the [[Orinoco]] River area in South America to settle in the Caribbean islands about 1200 AD, according to [[carbon dating]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. Over the two centuries leading up to [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in the Caribbean archipelago in 1492, the Caribs mostly displaced the [[Maipurean language|Maipurean]]-speaking [[Ta\u00ednos]] by warfare, extermination, and assimilation. The Ta\u00edno had settled the island chains earlier in history, migrating from the mainland.<ref>[http://www.diaspora.uiuc.edu/news0307/news0307-7.pdf Sweeney, James L.

None of the insular Amerindians mined for gold but obtained it by trade from the mainland. The Caribs were skilled boat builders and sailors. They appeared to have owed their dominance in the Caribbean basin to their mastery of warfare.\n\nAccording to Floyd, \"The question arose in [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus's]] time whether Indians could be enslaved and [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabel]] had ruled against it.  At about the same time, however, [[Alonso de Ojeda|Ojeda]], [[Rodrigo de Bastidas|Bastidas]], and other explorers voyaging along the [[Spanish Main]] had been attacked by Indians with poisoned arrows - all such Indians were considered Caribs - which took a considerable toll of Spanish lives.

Most fatalities resulted from [[Eurasia]]n infectious diseases such as [[smallpox]], which they had no natural [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to, as well as warfare.\n\nIn  1660, France and England signed with Island Caribs the [[Treaty of Saint Charles]] that stipulated that Caribs would evacuate all the Lesser Antilles except for [[Dominica]] and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Saint Vincent]], which were recognised as reserves.

The most famous form is [[punta]].  Its associated musical style, which has the dancers move their hips in a circular motion. An evolved form of traditional music, still usually played using traditional instruments, punta has seen some modernization and electrification in the 1970s; this is called [[punta rock]].  Traditional punta dancing is consciously competitive. Artists like [[Pen Cayetano]] helped innovate modern punta rock by adding [[guitar]]s to the traditional music, and paved the way for later artists like [[Andy Palacio]], [[Children of the Most High]] and [[Black Coral]]. Punta was popular across the region, especially in Belize, by the mid-1980s, culminating in the release of ''[[Punta Rockers]]'' in 1987, a compilation featuring many of the genre's biggest stars.\n\nOther forms of Garifuna music and dance include: hungu-hungu, combination, wanaragua, abaimahani, matamuerte, laremuna wadaguman, gunjai, sambai, charikanari, eremuna egi, paranda, berusu, punta rock, teremuna ligilisi, arumahani, and Mali-amalihani. Punta is the most popular dance in Garifuna culture.  It is performed around holidays and at parties and other social events. Punta lyrics are usually composed by the women. [[Chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]] are a circular dance in a three-beat rhythm, which is often combined with punta. There are other songs typical to each gender, women having [[eremwu eu]] and [[abaimajani]], rhythmic [[a cappella]] songs, and [[laremuna wadaguman]], men's [[work song]]s, [[chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]], a circular dance in a three-beat rhythm, which is often combined with punta.\n\nDrums play a very important role in Garifuna music.

Historically, it was thought their ancestors were mainland Caribs who had conquered the islands from their previous inhabitants, the [[Igneri]]. However, linguistic and archaeological evidence contradicts the notion of a mass emigration and conquest; the Island Carib language appears not to have been [[Cariban languages|Cariban]], but like that of their neighbors, the [[Ta\u00edno]]. Irving Rouse and others suggest that a smaller group of mainland Caribs conquered the islands without displacing their inhabitants, eventually adopting the local language but retaining their traditions of a South American origin.<ref>{{cite book |last= Rouse |first= Irving |date= 1992 |title= The Tainos |url= https://archive.org/details/tainosrisedeclin00rous |url-access= registration |quote= Island Carib. |location= |publisher= Yale University Press |page= [https://archive.org/details/tainosrisedeclin00rous/page/21 21] |isbn= 0300051816 |accessdate= May 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the early colonial period, the Caribs had a reputation as warriors who raided neighboring islands.

Some claim there is evidence as to the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both Carib and other Amerindian groups such as the [[Arawak]] and [[Tupinamba]]. Others argue Europeans misunderstood rituals, or falsely portrayed them to justify conquest and genocide. Today, the Caribs and their descendants continue to live in the Antilles, notably on the island of [[Dominica]]. The [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] or \"[[Black Caribs]]\", a group of mixed Carib, Arawak and African ancestry, also live principally in Central America.\n\n==History==\nThe Caribs are believed to have migrated from the [[Orinoco]] River area in South America to settle in the Caribbean islands about 1200 AD, according to [[carbon dating]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}. Over the two centuries leading up to [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in the Caribbean archipelago in 1492, the Caribs mostly displaced the [[Maipurean language|Maipurean]]-speaking [[Ta\u00ednos]] by warfare, extermination, and assimilation.

The most famous form is [[punta]].  Its associated musical style, which has the dancers move their hips in a circular motion. An evolved form of traditional music, still usually played using traditional instruments, punta has seen some modernization and electrification in the 1970s; this is called [[punta rock]].  Traditional punta dancing is consciously competitive. Artists like [[Pen Cayetano]] helped innovate modern punta rock by adding [[guitar]]s to the traditional music, and paved the way for later artists like [[Andy Palacio]], [[Children of the Most High]] and [[Black Coral]]. Punta was popular across the region, especially in Belize, by the mid-1980s, culminating in the release of ''[[Punta Rockers]]'' in 1987, a compilation featuring many of the genre's biggest stars.\n\nOther forms of Garifuna music and dance include: hungu-hungu, combination, wanaragua, abaimahani, matamuerte, laremuna wadaguman, gunjai, sambai, charikanari, eremuna egi, paranda, berusu, punta rock, teremuna ligilisi, arumahani, and Mali-amalihani. Punta is the most popular dance in Garifuna culture.  It is performed around holidays and at parties and other social events. Punta lyrics are usually composed by the women. [[Chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]] are a circular dance in a three-beat rhythm, which is often combined with punta. There are other songs typical to each gender, women having [[eremwu eu]] and [[abaimajani]], rhythmic [[a cappella]] songs, and [[laremuna wadaguman]], men's [[work song]]s, [[chumba]] and [[hunguhungu]], a circular dance in a three-beat rhythm, which is often combined with punta.\n\nDrums play a very important role in Garifuna music. There are primarily two types of drums used: the ''primero'' (tenor drum) and the ''segunda'' (bass drum). These drums are typically made of hollowed-out hardwood such as mahogany or mayflower, with the skins coming from the peccary (wild bush pig), deer, or sheep.\n\nAlso used in combination with the drums are the ''sisera''. These shakers are made from the dried fruit of the gourd tree, filled with seeds, then fitted with hardwood handles.\n\nParanda music developed soon after the Garifunas arrival in Central America. The music is instrumental and [[percussion instrument|percussion]]-based.  The music was barely recorded until the 1990s, when [[Ivan Duran]] of [[Stonetree Records]] began the [[Paranda Project]].\n\nIn contemporary Belize there has been a resurgence of Garifuna music, popularized by musicians such as Andy Palacio, Mohobub Flores, & Adrian Martinez. These musicians have taken many aspects from traditional Garifuna music forms and fused them with more modern sounds. Described as a mixture of punta rock and paranda. One great example is Andy Palacio's album ''Watina'', and ''Umalali: The Garifuna Women's Project'', both released on the Belizean record label Stonetree Records.\n\nIn the Garifuna culture, there is another dance called Dugu.

A furious Wallace then shoved Artest, and the benches emptied; a fight broke out on the court between players of both teams. After the fight was broken up, a fan threw a drink from the stands at Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table to cool himself down. Artest immediately charged after the fan, sparking a massive brawl between players and spectators that stretched from the seats down to the court and lasted several minutes.\n\nAfter the game, the NBA suspended nine players for a total of 146 games, leading to the players losing $11 million in salary. Five players were charged with assault, and eventually sentenced to a year of probation and community service. Five fans also faced criminal charges and were banned from attending Pistons home games for life. The fight also led the NBA to increase security between players and fans and limit the sale of alcohol in games.\n\n==Before the brawl==\nThe meeting was the first between the two teams since the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|previous season]]'s [[2004 NBA Playoffs#Conference Finals: (1) Indiana Pacers vs. (3) Detroit Pistons|Eastern Conference Finals]], which the Pistons won in six games en route to their first [[2004 NBA Finals|NBA title]] since the [[Detroit Pistons#1979.E2.80.931994: The Bad Boys era|\"Bad Boys\" era]] of the late 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_2004.html|title=2004 NBA Playoff Summary|work=basketball-reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=September 29, 2008}}</ref> This caused the game to receive much hype from the media and fans.

The Pacers got off to a quick start, opening up a 20-point lead with seven minutes to go before halftime. The Pistons managed to cut into the lead, trailing by 16 points by halftime. The Pistons opened the third quarter with a 9\u20132 run, but the Pacers ended it with a buzzer-beating three-pointer and a layup from [[Jamaal Tinsley]] heading into the fourth quarter. [[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard Hamilton]] and [[Lindsey Hunter]] started the last quarter with consecutive three-point field goals, as the Pistons cut into the lead again.

A furious Wallace then shoved Artest, and the benches emptied; a fight broke out on the court between players of both teams. After the fight was broken up, a fan threw a drink from the stands at Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table to cool himself down.

Five players were charged with assault, and eventually sentenced to a year of probation and community service.
