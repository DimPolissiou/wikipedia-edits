After the [[A320neo]] launch in December 2010 and its commercial success, [[Air Asia]]'s boss [[Tony Fernandes]] said he would like Airbus to [[re-engine]] the A330.<ref name=Challenges2011/> New engines like the [[GEnx]] or [[Rolls-Royce Trent 1000]] developed for the 787 could offer a 12%\u201315% fuel burn improvement, and [[Wingtip device#Blended winglets|sharklets]] at least 2%.<ref name=AI110718/>\n\nAirbus sales chief [[John Leahy (executive)|John Leahy]]'s argument was that the lower purchase price of an A330 even without new engines make the economics of buying an A330 competitive at midrange routes with that of the Boeing 787.<ref name=AW120709/> An A330neo would accelerate the demise of the similarly-sized [[A350-800]].<ref name=reuters140110/> Airbus also considered re-engining the [[Airbus A380|A380]] but was wary of having two major modification programs simultaneously.<ref name=AW140217/>\n\nIn March 2014, [[Delta Air Lines]] expressed an interest in the A330neo to replace its aging, 20+-year-old [[Boeing 767-300ER]] jets.<ref name=AW140311/> In the 250-300-seat market, [[CIT Group]] believes an A330neo enables profitability on shorter ranges where the longer-range A350 and Boeing 787 aren't optimized. Steve Mason, CIT vice president for aircraft analysis, said: \"The A350-800 is not as efficient as they'd like\". Steven Udvar-Hazy, chairman and CEO of [[Air Lease Corporation|Air Lease Corp]]., said, \"We don't believe it is rational for us to take the A350-800 and the A330neo [...] I don't see the A350-800 surviving if they do the A330neo\".<ref name=AW140324/>\n\n[[AirAsia X]] ended flights to London and Paris from Kuala Lumpur in 2012 because their Airbus A340s weren't fuel-efficient enough; AirAsiaX will try again with A330s.<ref name=WSJ140529/> As Airbus gradually increases output of the new A350, prolonging the production run of the A330 could help to maintain profitability.<ref name=reuters140610/> As [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] cancelled 70 orders for the A350, Airbus said it continued to work on re-engining the smaller A330.<ref name=reuters140611/>\n\n===Launch===\n[[File:Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 tested at Arnold Air Force Base Engineering Development Complex.jpg|thumb|The [[Rolls-Royce Trent 7000]] being tested at [[Arnold Engineering Development Complex]]]]\n\n<!--14 July 2014 -->\nOn 14 July 2014 at the [[Farnborough Airshow]], Airbus launched the A330neo programme, to be powered by the new [[Rolls-Royce Trent 7000]]. It would improve the [[Fuel economy in aircraft|fuel burn per seat]] by 14%. Airbus hoped to sell 1,000 A330neo aircraft. Its range would increase by {{convert|400|nmi|km}} and although 95% of the parts would be common with the A330ceo, maintenance costs would be lower. New [[winglet]]s, 3.7 metres wider and similar to those of the [[A350 XWB]], still within [[ICAO]] category E airport requirements, along with new engine pylons, would improve aerodynamics by 4%.<ref name=140714PR-living/>\n\nIts development costs were expected to have an impact of around \u22120.7% on Airbus's [[return on sales]] target from 2015 to 2017,<ref name=140714PR-launch/> an estimated $2 billion (\u00a31.18 billion).<ref name=reuters140610/><!-- this estimation is consistent with airbus' 0.7% of its \u20ac64.45Bn 2015 revenue = \u20ac451 million * 3 years = \u20ac1.35Bn --> Airbus stated that lower [[capital cost]] would make the A330neo the most cost-efficient medium-range [[wide-body aircraft]] in the market.<ref name=140714PR-powering/> Airbus said that it could pursue demand for 4,000 aircraft and that there was an open market for 2,600 jets not already addressed by backlogs with operators already using A330s. Aerodynamic modifications would include a re-twisted wing and optimised slats.<ref name=FG140714/>\n\nIn 2014, ''[[The Airline Monitor]]'''s Ed Greenslet stated that the A330neo would have the advantage of not being designed to fly 8,000 nmi, unlike the A350 and Boeing 787 which were thus less economical on shorter routes, although \"the vast majority of long-haul markets is 4,000 nmi or less\".<!--<ref name=AW140714/>--> \nHe also believed that an \"A330neo would enjoy a monopoly in its segment instantly\", with the [[Boeing 767]] \"essentially out of production\", the [[Boeing 757]] not replaced while the [[A321neo]] and the [[737-9]] are smaller and had less range, <!--<ref name=AW140714/>--> and that launching the A330neo would probably kill the smallest A350-800.<ref name=AW140714/>\n\nJohn Leahy estimated that the A330-900 would have operating costs on par with the [[787-9]], but would be available at 25% lower capital costs and could reach a production rate of 10 per month after a 7/8 per month rate at the production start.<ref name=AW140716/> Both A330neo variants were expected to have a maximum take-off weight of 242 t. The type design was frozen in late 2015.<ref name=WSJ140716/>\n\n[[Boeing]] Vice Chairman and Commercial Airplanes CEO [[Ray Conner]] dismissed the A330neo as a 2004 revamp which cannot match the 787's direct [[operating costs]], being {{cvt|20,000|lb|t}} heavier and having a wing only slightly improved from the 1980s design, and claimed the 787-10 was almost 30% more [[fuel economy in aircraft|efficient]] per-seat than the previous A330-300 and that a new engine would not close the gap \u2013 but he acknowledged that it could be a threat as it put pressure on Boeing as it sought to

After the [[A320neo]] launch in December 2010 and its commercial success, [[Air Asia]]'s boss [[Tony Fernandes]] said he would like Airbus to [[re-engine]] the A330.<ref name=Challenges2011/> New engines like the [[GEnx]] or [[Rolls-Royce Trent 1000]] developed for the 787 could offer a 12%\u201315% fuel burn improvement, and [[Wingtip device#Blended winglets|sharklets]] at least 2%.<ref name=AI110718/>\n\nAirbus sales chief [[John Leahy (executive)|John Leahy]]'s argument was that the lower purchase price of an A330 even without new engines make the economics of buying an A330 competitive at midrange routes with that of the Boeing 787.<ref name=AW120709/> An A330neo would accelerate the demise of the similarly-sized [[A350-800]].<ref name=reuters140110/> Airbus also considered re-engining the [[Airbus A380|A380]] but was wary of having two major modification programs simultaneously.<ref name=AW140217/>\n\nIn March 2014, [[Delta Air Lines]] expressed an interest in the A330neo to replace its aging, 20+-year-old [[Boeing 767-300ER]] jets.<ref name=AW140311/> In the 250-300-seat market, [[CIT Group]] believes an A330neo enables profitability on shorter ranges where the longer-range A350 and Boeing 787 aren't optimized. Steve Mason, CIT vice president for aircraft analysis, said: \"The A350-800 is not as efficient as they'd like\". Steven Udvar-Hazy, chairman and CEO of [[Air Lease Corporation|Air Lease Corp]]., said, \"We don't believe it is rational for us to take the A350-800 and the A330neo [...] I don't see the A350-800 surviving if they do the A330neo\".<ref name=AW140324/>\n\n[[AirAsia X]] ended flights to London and Paris from Kuala Lumpur in 2012 because their Airbus A340s weren't fuel-efficient enough; AirAsiaX will try again with A330s.<ref name=WSJ140529/> As Airbus gradually increases output of the new A350, prolonging the production run of the A330 could help to maintain profitability.<ref name=reuters140610/> As [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] cancelled 70 orders for the A350, Airbus said it continued to work on re-engining the smaller A330.<ref name=reuters140611/>\n\n===Launch===\n[[File:Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 tested at Arnold Air Force Base Engineering Development Complex.jpg|thumb|The [[Rolls-Royce Trent 7000]] being tested at [[Arnold Engineering Development Complex]]]]\n\n<!--14 July 2014 -->\nOn 14 July 2014 at the [[Farnborough Airshow]], Airbus launched the A330neo programme, to be powered by the new [[Rolls-Royce Trent 7000]]. It would improve the [[Fuel economy in aircraft|fuel burn per seat]] by 14%. Airbus hoped to sell 1,000 A330neo aircraft. Its range would increase by {{convert|400|nmi|km}} and although 95% of the parts would be common with the A330ceo, maintenance costs would be lower. New [[winglet]]s, 3.7 metres wider and similar to those of the [[A350 XWB]], still within [[ICAO]] category E airport requirements, along with new engine pylons, would improve aerodynamics by 4%.<ref name=140714PR-living/>\n\nIts development costs were expected to have an impact of around \u22120.7% on Airbus's [[return on sales]] target from 2015 to 2017,<ref name=140714PR-launch/> an estimated $2 billion (\u00a31.18 billion).<ref name=reuters140610/><!-- this estimation is consistent with airbus' 0.7% of its \u20ac64.45Bn 2015 revenue = \u20ac451 million * 3 years = \u20ac1.35Bn --> Airbus stated that lower [[capital cost]] would make the A330neo the most cost-efficient medium-range [[wide-body aircraft]] in the market.<ref name=140714PR-powering/> Airbus said that it could pursue demand for 4,000 aircraft and that there was an open market for 2,600 jets not already addressed by backlogs with operators already using A330s. Aerodynamic modifications would include a re-twisted wing and optimised slats.<ref name=FG140714/>\n\nIn 2014, ''[[The Airline Monitor]]'''s Ed Greenslet stated that the A330neo would have the advantage of not being designed to fly 8,000 nmi, unlike the A350 and Boeing 787 which were thus less economical on shorter routes, although \"the vast majority of long-haul markets is 4,000 nmi or less\".<!--<ref name=AW140714/>--> \nHe also believed that an \"A330neo would enjoy a monopoly in its segment instantly\", with the [[Boeing 767]] \"essentially out of production\", the [[Boeing 757]] not replaced while the [[A321neo]] and the [[737-9]] are smaller and had less range, <!--<ref name=AW140714/>--> and that launching the A330neo would probably kill the smallest A350-800.<ref name=AW140714/>\n\nJohn Leahy estimated that the A330-900 would have operating costs on par with the [[787-9]], but would be available at 25% lower capital costs and could reach a production rate of 10 per month after a 7/8 per month rate at the production start.<ref name=AW140716/> Both A330neo variants were expected to have a maximum take-off weight of 242 t. The type design was frozen in late 2015.<ref name=WSJ140716/>\n\n[[Boeing]] Vice Chairman and Commercial Airplanes CEO [[Ray Conner]] dismissed the A330neo as a 2004 revamp which cannot match the 787's direct [[operating costs]], being {{cvt|20,000|lb|t}} heavier and having a wing only slightly improved from the 1980s design, and claimed the 787-10 was almost 30% more [[fuel economy in aircraft|efficient]] per-seat than the previous A330-300 and that a new engine would not close the gap \u2013 but he acknowledged that it could be a threat as it put pressure on Boeing as it sought to [[break even]] after 850\u20131,000 787 deliveries.<ref name=AW140721/>\n\n=== Production ===\n[[File:TAP Portugal A330neo interior ITB 2017.JPG|thumb|TAP Air Portugal interior mockup at [[ITB
