He subsequently achieved nominal autonomy from the central Abbasid government. During his reign (868&ndash;884) and those of his successors, the Tulunid domains were expanded to include [[Jordan Rift Valley]], as well as [[Hejaz]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Crete]]. Ahmad was succeeded by his son Khumarawayh, whose military and diplomatic achievements made him a major player in the Middle Eastern political stage. The Abbasids affirmed their recognition of the Tulunids as legitimate rulers, and the dynasty's status as vassals to the [[caliphate]]. After Khumarawayh's death, his successor [[emir]]s were ineffectual rulers, allowing their [[Turkish people|Turkic]] and black [[Slavery in Islam|slave]]-soldiers to run the affairs of the state. In 905, the Tulunids were unable to resist an invasion by the Abbasid troops, who restored direct caliphal rule in Syria and Egypt.<ref name = Britannica>\"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9073737/Tulunid-Dynasty Tulunid Dynasty].\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref><ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nThe Tulunid period was marked by economic and administrative reforms alongside cultural ones. Ahmad ibn Tulun changed the taxation system and aligned himself with the merchant community. He also established the Tulunid army. The capital was moved from [[Fustat]] to [[al-Qata'i]], where the celebrated [[mosque of Ibn Tulun]] was constructed.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the fragmentation of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in the 9th and 10th centuries]]\nThe rise and fall of the Tulunids occurred against a backdrop of increasing [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] in the [[Muslim world]]. The [[Abbasid caliphate]] was struggling with [[Anarchy at Samarra|political disturbances]] and losing its aura of universal legitimacy. There had previously been [[Copt]]ic and [[Alid|Shia Alid]]-led movements in Egypt and Baghdad, without more than temporary and local success. There was also a struggle for power between the Turkish military command and the administration of [[Baghdad]]. Furthermore, there was a widening imperial financial crisis. All of these themes would recur during the Tulunid rule.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nThe internal politics of the Abbasid caliphate itself seem to have been unstable. In 870, [[Al-Muwaffaq (vizier)|Ab\u016b A\u1e25mad (b. al-Mutawakkil) al-Muwaffa\u1e33]] (d. 891) was summoned from exile in [[Mecca]] to re-establish Abbasid authority over southern Iraq. Quickly, however, he became the ''de facto'' ruler of the caliphate. As a result of this uncertainty, Ahmad ibn Tulun could establish and expand his authority. Thus the Tulunids wielded regional power, largely unhindered by imperial will; as such, the Tulunids can be compared with other 9th-century dynasties of the Muslim world, including the [[Aghlabid]]s and the [[Tahirids]].<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\n===Ahmad ibn Tulun===\n{{main|Ahmad ibn Tulun}}\nAhmad ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn was a member of the mostly Central Asian Turkish guard formed initially in [[Baghdad]], then later settled in [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]], upon its establishment as the seat of the caliphate by [[al-Mu'tasim]]. In 254/868,<ref>The first date indicates the year according to the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri calendar]], while the second one denotes the corresponding Gregorian year</ref> Ibn Tulun was sent to Egypt as resident governor by B\u0101yakb\u0101k (d. 256/870), the representative of the Abbasid caliph al-Mu\u02bftazz.<ref name=\"EI1\">\"\u1e6c\u016bl\u016bnids,\" ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref> Ibn Tulun promptly established a financial and military presence in the province of Egypt by establishing an independent Egyptian army and taking over the management of the Egyptian and Syrian treasuries. In 877, troops of the caliphate were sent against him, due to his insufficient payment of tribute. Ahmad ibn Tulun, however, maintained his power, and took Syria the following year.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\nHis reign of more than ten years allowed him to leave behind a well-trained military, a stable economy and an experienced bureaucracy to oversee the state affairs. He appointed his son, \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh, as the heir.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nWith full autonomy, once the tax income no longer had to go to the [[Caliph]] in Baghdad, it was possible to develop irrigation works and build a navy, which greatly stimulated the local economy and trade. In 878, the [[Jordan Rift Valley|Jordan valley]] was occupied by the Tulunids, extending in the north to the outposts in the Anti-Lebanon mountains on the Byzantine border, enabling them to defend Egypt against Abbasid attack.<ref>Lev, Yaacov, ''War and society in the eastern Mediterranean, 7th-15th centuries'', BRILL, 1997, pp.129-130</ref>\n\n===Khumarawayh===\n[[File:Tulunids 893.svg|thumb|right|300px|Extent of the Tulunid domains under Khumarawayh, in 893]]\nFollowing his father's death, [[Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun|Khumarawayh]] took control as the designated heir. The first challenge he faced was the invasion of Syria by armies sent by al-Muwaffak, the ''de facto'' ruler during the reign of caliph al-Mu'tamid. Khumarawayh also had to deal with the defection of Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Wasiti, a long-time and key ally of his father's, to the invaders' camp.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nThe young Tulunid achieved political and military gains, enabling him to extend his authority from Egypt into northern Iraq, and as far north as [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] by 890. Being now a prominent player in the Near Eastern political stage, he negotiated two treaties with the Abbasids. In the first treaty in 886, al-Muwaffak recognized Tulunid authority over Egypt and the regions of Syria for a thirty-year period. The second treaty, reached with al-Mu\u02bftadid in 892, confirmed the terms of the earlier accord. Both treaties also sought to confirm the status of the Tulunid governor as a vassal of the caliphal family seated in Baghdad.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nDespite his gains, Khumarawayh's reign also set the stage for the demise of the dynasty. Financial exhaustion, political infighting and strides by the Abbasids would all contribute to the ruin of the Tulunids.<ref name=\"EI1\"/> Khumarawayh was also totally reliant on his Turkish and sub-Saharan soldiers. Under the administration of Khumarawayh, the Syro-Egyptian state's finances and military were destabilized.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\n===Demise===\nThe later emirs of the dynasty were all ineffectual rulers, relying on their Turkish and black soldiers to run the affairs of the state.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\nKhumarawayh's son [[Abu 'l-Asakir Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh|Abu 'l-Asakir]] (also known as Jaysh) was deposed by the Tulunid military command in 896 AD, shortly after coming to power. He was succeeded by his brother, [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh|Harun]]. Though he would rule for eight years, he was unable to revitalize the dynasty, and was assassinated in 904, after the Abbasid army had recovered Syria and was on the verge of invading Egypt itself. Harun's successor, his uncle [[Shayban ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]], was unable to resist an Abbasid invasion under the command of [[Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib]], with naval support from [[Thughur|frontier]] forces under [[Damian of Tarsus]]. This brought an end to his reign and that of the Tulunids.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\n==Culture==\n{{see also|al-Qata'i|Mosque of Ibn Tulun}}\n[[File:Kairo Ibn Tulun Moschee BW 7.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Minaret of [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun|Ibn-Tulun Mosque]], the largest remaining building from the Tulunid period today.]]\nAhmad ibn Tulun founded his own capital, [[al-Qata'i]], north of the previous capital [[Fustat]], where he seated his government. One of the dominant features of this city, and indeed the feature that survives today, was the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]]. The mosque is built in a [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]n style that was common in the period during which the caliphate had shifted capitals from [[Baghdad]] to [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]. This style of architecture was not just confined to religious buildings, but secular ones also. Surviving houses of the Tulunid period have Samarran-style stucco panels.<ref>Behrens-Abouseif (1989)</ref>\n\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh's reign exceeded his father's in spending. He built luxuriant palaces and gardens for himself and those he favored. To the Tulunid Egyptians, his \"marvelous\" blue-eyed palace lion exemplified his prodigality. His stables were so extensive that, according to popular lore, Khumarawaih never rode a horse more than once. Though he squandered the dynastic wealth, he also encouraged a rich cultural life with patronage of scholarship and poetry. His prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the teacher of his sons was the famed grammarian Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u02bfAbd All\u0101h ibn Mu\u1e25ammad Muslim (d. 944).  An encomium was written by \u1e32\u0101sim b . Ya\u1e25y\u0101 al-Maryam\u012b (d. 929) to celebrate Khumarawaih's triumphs on the battlefield.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\nThrough the mediation of his closest adviser, al-\u1e24usayn ibn \u1e0ej\u0332a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101\u1e63 al-\u1e0ej\u0332awhar\u012b, Khumarawaih arranged for one of the great political marriages of medieval [[Islamic history]]. He proposed his daughter's marriage to a member of the caliphal family in Baghdad. The marriage between the Tulunid princess \u1e32a\u1e6dr al-Nad\u0101 with the Abbasid [[caliph]] [[al-Mu'tadid]] took place in 892. The exorbitant marriage included an awesome dowry estimated at between 400,000 and one million [[dinar]]s. Some speculate that the splendours of the wedding were a calculated attempt by the Abbasids to ruin the Tulunids. The tale of the splendid nuptials of \u1e32a\u1e6dr al-Nad\u0101 lived on in the memory of the [[Egyptian people]] well into the [[Ottoman Egypt|Ottoman period]], and were recorded in the chronicles and the folk-literature.<ref name = Khumarawayh/> The marriage's importance arises from its exceptional nature: the phenomenon of marriage between royal families is rare in Islamic history.<ref>Rizk, Yunan Labib.[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/784/chrncls.htm Royal mix] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625135135/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/784/chrncls.htm |date=25 June 2013 }}.

The need for the establishment of an autonomous armed force became apparent after the revolt of \u02bf\u012as\u0101 ibn al-S\u0332h\u0332ayk\u0332h, governor of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], in 870. In response, Ibn Tulun organized an army composed of [[Sudan]]ese and [[Greeks|Greek]] slave-soldiers. Other reports indicate the soldiers may have been [[Persian people|Persians]] and Sudanese.<ref name=\"EI1\"/> \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh continued his father's policy of having a multi-ethnic army. His military prowess, in fact, was strengthened by his multi-ethnic regiments of black Sudanese soldiers, Greek mercenaries and fresh [[Turkic people|Turkic]] troops from [[Turkestan]].<ref name = Khumarawayh>\"\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh  b. A\u1e25mad b. \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn ,\" ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref>\n\nIbn Tulun founded an \u00e9lite guard to surround the Tulunid family. These formed the core of the Tulunid army, around which other larger regiments were built. These troops are said to have been from the region of G\u0332h\u0332\u016br in [[Afghanistan]], during Ibn Tulun's reign, and from local Arabs during the reign of \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh. In a ceremony held in 871, Ibn Tulun had his forces swear personal allegiance to him. Nevertheless, there were defections from the Tulunid army, most notably of the high-ranking commander Lu\u02belu\u02be in 883 to the Abbasids. Throughout its life the army faced such persistent problems of securing allegiance.<ref name = EI1/>\n\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh also established an elite corps called ''al-muk\u0332h\u0332t\u0101ra''. The corps was composed of unruly [[bedouin]]s of the eastern [[Nile delta]]. By bestowing privileges upon the tribesmen, and converting them into an efficient and loyal bodyguard, he brought peace to the region between Egypt and Syria. He also re-asserted his control over this strategic region. The regiment also included one thousand Sudanese natives.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\nA list of military engagements in which the Tulunid army constituted a significant party is as follows:\n*In 877, the Tulunid troops, after displaying their strength, forced the Abbasid army under [[Musa ibn Bugha|M\u016bs\u0101 ibn Bug\u0332h\u0332\u0101]] to abandon his plan to depose Ahmad ibn Tulun.<ref name = Ahmad>\"A\u1e25mad  b. \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn\" ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref>\n*In 878, the Tulunids, under the pretext of a ''[[jihad]]'' to defend the frontier districts ([[Thughur]]) against the Byzantines, occupied Syria. This campaign was ended prematurely, as Ibn Tulun had to return to Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n*In 885, the Tulunid army led by Khumarawayh met the invading Abbasids at the [[Battle of the Mills]] (al-\u1e6caw\u0101\u1e25\u012bn) in southern Palestine. The Abbasids, led by A\u1e25mad ibn al-Muwaffa\u1e33 (the future Caliph al-Mu'tadid), had invaded Syria, and the governor of Damascus had defected to the enemy. After both Ahmad and Khumarawayh fled the battlefield, the \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bnid general Sa\u02bfd al-Aysar secured victory.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n*From 885\u2013886, the Tulunid forces, led by Khumarawayh, defeated [[Ishaq ibn Kundaj|Ibn Kund\u0101d\u0332j]], though the latter had superior numbers. A [[domino effect]] followed, as the [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]], [[Cilicia]] and regions as far east as [[Harran]] submitted to the Tulunid army. Peace treaties with the Tulunids put an end to the military campaigns.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n*From 896 to 905, after the emirate's demise  the Tulunids were unable to stop the Abbasids from taking their capital [[al-Qata'i]].<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\n==Economy==\nDuring the reign of Ahmad ibn Tulun, the Egyptian economy remained prosperous. There were propitious levels of agricultural production, stimulated by consistent high flooding of the Nile. Other industries, particularly [[textile]]s, also thrived. In his administration, ibn Tulun asserted his autonomy, refusing to pay taxes to the central Abbasid government in Baghdad. He also reformed the administration, aligning himself with the merchant community, and changing the taxation system. Under the Tulunids, there were also repairs in the agricultural infrastructure. The key sector of production, investment, and participation in their Mediterranean-wide commerce, was textiles, [[linen]] in particular (Frantz, 281-5).<ref name = EI1/> The financial bureaucracy throughout the Tulunid period was headed by members of the [[al-Madhara'i]] family.\n\n===Financial autonomy===\nDuring the period of 870\u2013872, Ibn Tulun asserted more control over Egypt's financial administration. In 871, he took control of the ''[[kharaj]]'' taxes as well as the ''[[thughur|thugh\u016br]]'' from Syria. He also achieved victory over Ibn al-Mudabbir, the head of the finance office and member of the Abbasid bureaucratic \u00e9lite.<ref name = EI1/>\n\nThe ''de facto'' ruler of the Abbasid caliphate, al-Muwaffak, took issue with Ibn Tulun's financial activities. He wanted to secure Egyptian revenue for his campaign against the [[Zanj]] rebellion (and perhaps limit the autonomy of the Tulunids). This pressing need for funds drew the attention of Baghdad to the considerably more wealthy Egypt.<ref name = EI1/> The situation came to a head in 877, when al-Muwaffak, upon not receiving the demanded funds, sent an army to depose Ahmad ibn Tulun.<ref name = Ahmad/> Nevertheless, on at least two occasions, Ibn Tulun remitted considerable sums of revenue, along with gifts, to the central Abbasid administration.<ref name = EI1/>\n\nUnder Ahmad's son, Khumarawayh, the Abbasids formally entered into a treaty with the Tulunids, thereby ending hostilities and resuming the payment of tribute. Financial provisions were made in the first treaty in 886 with al-Muwaffak. A second treaty with al-Mu\u02bfta\u1e0did, the son of al-Muwaffak, in 892, re-affirmed the political terms of the first. Financially, the Tulunids were to pay 300,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs (though this figure may be inaccurate) annually.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\n===Tulunid administration===\nThe T\u016bl\u016bnid administration over Egypt bore several notable features. The style of rule was highly centralized and \"pitiless\" in its execution. The administration was also backed by Egypt's commercial, religious and social \u00e9lite. Ahmad ibn Tulun replaced Iraqi officials with an Egyptian bureaucracy. Overall, the administration relied on the powerful merchant community for both financial and diplomatic support. For example, Ma\u02bfmar al-\u1e0ej\u0332awhar\u012b, a leading member of the merchant community in Egypt, served as Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn's financier.<ref name = EI1/>\n\nThe Tulunid administration also helped the economy prosper, by maintaining political stability, which in Egypt is a ''[[sine qua non]]''. Isolated revolts among the Copts and some Arab nomads in upper Egypt, which never threatened the dynasty's power, were actually a response to the more efficient Tulunid fiscal practices. The economy was strengthened by reforms introduced both immediately before the Tulunids and during their reign. There were changes in the tax assessment and collection system. There was also an expansion in the use of [[Tax farm|tax-contracts]], which were the source of an emergent land-holding \u00e9lite in this period.<ref name = EI1/> Ahmad ibn Tulun's agrarian and administrative reforms encouraged peasants to work their lands with zeal, despite the heavy taxes. He also terminated the exactions of the administration's officers for their personal profit.<ref name = Ahmad/>\n\nOne final feature of the administration under Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn was the discontinuation of the practice of draining off the majority of his revenue to the metropolis. Instead, he initiated building programs to benefit other parts of Egypt. He also used those funds to stimulate commerce and industry.<ref name = Ahmad/>\n\n===Large expenditures===\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh inherited a stable economy and a wealthy [[polity]] from his father. The treasury was worth ten million d\u012bn\u0101rs at the young Tulunid's succession. When \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh was killed in 896, the treasury was empty, and the dinar had sunk to one-third its value. Part of this financial disaster is attributed to his addiction to luxury, while squandering wealth to win loyalty was also another cause.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh, unlike his father, spent lavishly. For example, he gave his daughter, \u1e32a\u1e6dr al-Nad\u0101, an extraordinary dowry of 400,000 - 1,000,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs, for her wedding in 892 to the Abbasid al-Mu\u02bfta\u1e0did. This move is speculated by some scholars to have been an attempt by the Abbasids to drain the Tulunid treasury.<ref name = EI1/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Sunni Muslim dynasties]]\n\n===Neighboring states===\n*[[Abbasid]]s\n*[[Byzantine empire]]\n*[[Makuria]]\n*[[Rustamids]]\n\n===Tulunid Amirs===\n{| width=100% class=\"wikitable\" \n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=9% | Titular Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=9% | Personal Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=9% | Reign \n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | ''De facto'' autonomy from the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] during the reign of ''Caliph'' [[al-Mu'tamid]].\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| '''[[Ahmad ibn Tulun]]'''<br> <small>{{Nastaliq| \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646}}</small> \n|align=\"center\"|868 - 884 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| ''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Jaysh''<br><small>{{Nastaliq| \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u062c\u06cc\u0634}}</small><br>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]] <br> <small>{{Nastaliq|\u062e\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 }} </small>\n|align=\"center\"|884 - 896 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Ashir ''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u06cc\u0631 }}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Asakir ''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0627\u0643\u0631}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Abu 'l-Asakir Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh|Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh]]<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u062c\u06cc\u0634 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062e\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 }}</small><br>\n|align=\"center\"|896 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| ''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu Musa''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u06cc}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh]]<br> <small>{{Nastaliq|\u06c1\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062e\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 }}</small>\n|align=\"center\"|896 - 904 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Manaqib''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0628}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Shayban ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]]<br> <small>{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u0627\u0626\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"|904 - 905 CE\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#F5DEB3\"\n| colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |  Re-conquered by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] during the reign of Caliph [[al-Muktafi]] by general Muhammad ibn Sulayman.\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal |title=The Emergence of Muslim Rule in India: Some Historical Disconnects and Missing Links |first=Tanvir |last=Anjum |journal=Islamic Studies |publisher=Islamic Research Institute |volume=46 |issue=2 |year=2007 |pages=217\u2013240 [p. 233] |jstor=20839068 |ref=harv }}\n*Behrens-Abouseif, Doris (1989). \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090305144249/http://archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/6405/doc/DPC0530.pdf Early Islamic Architecture in Cairo]\".

He subsequently achieved nominal autonomy from the central Abbasid government. During his reign (868&ndash;884) and those of his successors, the Tulunid domains were expanded to include [[Jordan Rift Valley]], as well as [[Hejaz]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Crete]]. Ahmad was succeeded by his son Khumarawayh, whose military and diplomatic achievements made him a major player in the Middle Eastern political stage. The Abbasids affirmed their recognition of the Tulunids as legitimate rulers, and the dynasty's status as vassals to the [[caliphate]]. After Khumarawayh's death, his successor [[emir]]s were ineffectual rulers, allowing their [[Turkish people|Turkic]] and black [[Slavery in Islam|slave]]-soldiers to run the affairs of the state. In 905, the Tulunids were unable to resist an invasion by the Abbasid troops, who restored direct caliphal rule in Syria and Egypt.<ref name = Britannica>\"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9073737/Tulunid-Dynasty Tulunid Dynasty].\" ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''</ref><ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nThe Tulunid period was marked by economic and administrative reforms alongside cultural ones. Ahmad ibn Tulun changed the taxation system and aligned himself with the merchant community. He also established the Tulunid army. The capital was moved from [[Fustat]] to [[al-Qata'i]], where the celebrated [[mosque of Ibn Tulun]] was constructed.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the fragmentation of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in the 9th and 10th centuries]]\nThe rise and fall of the Tulunids occurred against a backdrop of increasing [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] in the [[Muslim world]]. The [[Abbasid caliphate]] was struggling with [[Anarchy at Samarra|political disturbances]] and losing its aura of universal legitimacy. There had previously been [[Copt]]ic and [[Alid|Shia Alid]]-led movements in Egypt and Baghdad, without more than temporary and local success. There was also a struggle for power between the Turkish military command and the administration of [[Baghdad]]. Furthermore, there was a widening imperial financial crisis. All of these themes would recur during the Tulunid rule.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nThe internal politics of the Abbasid caliphate itself seem to have been unstable. In 870, [[Al-Muwaffaq (vizier)|Ab\u016b A\u1e25mad (b. al-Mutawakkil) al-Muwaffa\u1e33]] (d. 891) was summoned from exile in [[Mecca]] to re-establish Abbasid authority over southern Iraq. Quickly, however, he became the ''de facto'' ruler of the caliphate. As a result of this uncertainty, Ahmad ibn Tulun could establish and expand his authority. Thus the Tulunids wielded regional power, largely unhindered by imperial will; as such, the Tulunids can be compared with other 9th-century dynasties of the Muslim world, including the [[Aghlabid]]s and the [[Tahirids]].<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\n===Ahmad ibn Tulun===\n{{main|Ahmad ibn Tulun}}\nAhmad ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn was a member of the mostly Central Asian Turkish guard formed initially in [[Baghdad]], then later settled in [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]], upon its establishment as the seat of the caliphate by [[al-Mu'tasim]]. In 254/868,<ref>The first date indicates the year according to the [[Islamic calendar|Hijri calendar]], while the second one denotes the corresponding Gregorian year</ref> Ibn Tulun was sent to Egypt as resident governor by B\u0101yakb\u0101k (d. 256/870), the representative of the Abbasid caliph al-Mu\u02bftazz.<ref name=\"EI1\">\"\u1e6c\u016bl\u016bnids,\" ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref> Ibn Tulun promptly established a financial and military presence in the province of Egypt by establishing an independent Egyptian army and taking over the management of the Egyptian and Syrian treasuries. In 877, troops of the caliphate were sent against him, due to his insufficient payment of tribute. Ahmad ibn Tulun, however, maintained his power, and took Syria the following year.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\nHis reign of more than ten years allowed him to leave behind a well-trained military, a stable economy and an experienced bureaucracy to oversee the state affairs. He appointed his son, \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh, as the heir.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nWith full autonomy, once the tax income no longer had to go to the [[Caliph]] in Baghdad, it was possible to develop irrigation works and build a navy, which greatly stimulated the local economy and trade. In 878, the [[Jordan Rift Valley|Jordan valley]] was occupied by the Tulunids, extending in the north to the outposts in the Anti-Lebanon mountains on the Byzantine border, enabling them to defend Egypt against Abbasid attack.<ref>Lev, Yaacov, ''War and society in the eastern Mediterranean, 7th-15th centuries'', BRILL, 1997, pp.129-130</ref>\n\n===Khumarawayh===\n[[File:Tulunids 893.svg|thumb|right|300px|Extent of the Tulunid domains under Khumarawayh, in 893]]\nFollowing his father's death, [[Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun|Khumarawayh]] took control as the designated heir. The first challenge he faced was the invasion of Syria by armies sent by al-Muwaffak, the ''de facto'' ruler during the reign of caliph al-Mu'tamid. Khumarawayh also had to deal with the defection of Ahmad ibn Muhammad al-Wasiti, a long-time and key ally of his father's, to the invaders' camp.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nThe young Tulunid achieved political and military gains, enabling him to extend his authority from Egypt into northern Iraq, and as far north as [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] by 890. Being now a prominent player in the Near Eastern political stage, he negotiated two treaties with the Abbasids. In the first treaty in 886, al-Muwaffak recognized Tulunid authority over Egypt and the regions of Syria for a thirty-year period. The second treaty, reached with al-Mu\u02bftadid in 892, confirmed the terms of the earlier accord. Both treaties also sought to confirm the status of the Tulunid governor as a vassal of the caliphal family seated in Baghdad.<ref name=\"EI1\"/>\n\nDespite his gains, Khumarawayh's reign also set the stage for the demise of the dynasty. Financial exhaustion, political infighting and strides by the Abbasids would all contribute to the ruin of the Tulunids.<ref name=\"EI1\"/> Khumarawayh was also totally reliant on his Turkish and sub-Saharan soldiers. Under the administration of Khumarawayh, the Syro-Egyptian state's finances and military were destabilized.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\n===Demise===\nThe later emirs of the dynasty were all ineffectual rulers, relying on their Turkish and black soldiers to run the affairs of the state.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\nKhumarawayh's son [[Abu 'l-Asakir Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh|Abu 'l-Asakir]] (also known as Jaysh) was deposed by the Tulunid military command in 896 AD, shortly after coming to power. He was succeeded by his brother, [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh|Harun]]. Though he would rule for eight years, he was unable to revitalize the dynasty, and was assassinated in 904, after the Abbasid army had recovered Syria and was on the verge of invading Egypt itself. Harun's successor, his uncle [[Shayban ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]], was unable to resist an Abbasid invasion under the command of [[Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib]], with naval support from [[Thughur|frontier]] forces under [[Damian of Tarsus]]. This brought an end to his reign and that of the Tulunids.<ref name = Britannica/>\n\n==Culture==\n{{see also|al-Qata'i|Mosque of Ibn Tulun}}\n[[File:Kairo Ibn Tulun Moschee BW 7.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Minaret of [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun|Ibn-Tulun Mosque]], the largest remaining building from the Tulunid period today.]]\nAhmad ibn Tulun founded his own capital, [[al-Qata'i]], north of the previous capital [[Fustat]], where he seated his government. One of the dominant features of this city, and indeed the feature that survives today, was the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]]. The mosque is built in a [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]n style that was common in the period during which the caliphate had shifted capitals from [[Baghdad]] to [[Abbasid Samarra|Samarra]]. This style of architecture was not just confined to religious buildings, but secular ones also. Surviving houses of the Tulunid period have Samarran-style stucco panels.<ref>Behrens-Abouseif (1989)</ref>\n\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh's reign exceeded his father's in spending. He built luxuriant palaces and gardens for himself and those he favored. To the Tulunid Egyptians, his \"marvelous\" blue-eyed palace lion exemplified his prodigality. His stables were so extensive that, according to popular lore, Khumarawaih never rode a horse more than once. Though he squandered the dynastic wealth, he also encouraged a rich cultural life with patronage of scholarship and poetry. His prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and the teacher of his sons was the famed grammarian Mu\u1e25ammad ibn \u02bfAbd All\u0101h ibn Mu\u1e25ammad Muslim (d. 944).  An encomium was written by \u1e32\u0101sim b .

He proposed his daughter's marriage to a member of the caliphal family in Baghdad. The marriage between the Tulunid princess \u1e32a\u1e6dr al-Nad\u0101 with the Abbasid [[caliph]] [[al-Mu'tadid]] took place in 892. The exorbitant marriage included an awesome dowry estimated at between 400,000 and one million [[dinar]]s. Some speculate that the splendours of the wedding were a calculated attempt by the Abbasids to ruin the Tulunids. The tale of the splendid nuptials of \u1e32a\u1e6dr al-Nad\u0101 lived on in the memory of the [[Egyptian people]] well into the [[Ottoman Egypt|Ottoman period]], and were recorded in the chronicles and the folk-literature.<ref name = Khumarawayh/> The marriage's importance arises from its exceptional nature: the phenomenon of marriage between royal families is rare in Islamic history.<ref>Rizk, Yunan Labib.[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/784/chrncls.htm Royal mix] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625135135/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/784/chrncls.htm |date=25 June 2013 }}.

The need for the establishment of an autonomous armed force became apparent after the revolt of \u02bf\u012as\u0101 ibn al-S\u0332h\u0332ayk\u0332h, governor of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], in 870. In response, Ibn Tulun organized an army composed of [[Sudan]]ese and [[Greeks|Greek]] slave-soldiers. Other reports indicate the soldiers may have been [[Persian people|Persians]] and Sudanese.<ref name=\"EI1\"/> \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh continued his father's policy of having a multi-ethnic army. His military prowess, in fact, was strengthened by his multi-ethnic regiments of black Sudanese soldiers, Greek mercenaries and fresh [[Turkic people|Turkic]] troops from [[Turkestan]].<ref name = Khumarawayh>\"\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh  b. A\u1e25mad b. \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn ,\" ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref>\n\nIbn Tulun founded an \u00e9lite guard to surround the Tulunid family. These formed the core of the Tulunid army, around which other larger regiments were built. These troops are said to have been from the region of G\u0332h\u0332\u016br in [[Afghanistan]], during Ibn Tulun's reign, and from local Arabs during the reign of \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh. In a ceremony held in 871, Ibn Tulun had his forces swear personal allegiance to him. Nevertheless, there were defections from the Tulunid army, most notably of the high-ranking commander Lu\u02belu\u02be in 883 to the Abbasids. Throughout its life the army faced such persistent problems of securing allegiance.<ref name = EI1/>\n\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh also established an elite corps called ''al-muk\u0332h\u0332t\u0101ra''. The corps was composed of unruly [[bedouin]]s of the eastern [[Nile delta]]. By bestowing privileges upon the tribesmen, and converting them into an efficient and loyal bodyguard, he brought peace to the region between Egypt and Syria. He also re-asserted his control over this strategic region. The regiment also included one thousand Sudanese natives.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\nA list of military engagements in which the Tulunid army constituted a significant party is as follows:\n*In 877, the Tulunid troops, after displaying their strength, forced the Abbasid army under [[Musa ibn Bugha|M\u016bs\u0101 ibn Bug\u0332h\u0332\u0101]] to abandon his plan to depose Ahmad ibn Tulun.<ref name = Ahmad>\"A\u1e25mad  b. \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn\" ''Encyclopaedia of Islam''</ref>\n*In 878, the Tulunids, under the pretext of a ''[[jihad]]'' to defend the frontier districts ([[Thughur]]) against the Byzantines, occupied Syria. This campaign was ended prematurely, as Ibn Tulun had to return to Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n*In 885, the Tulunid army led by Khumarawayh met the invading Abbasids at the [[Battle of the Mills]] (al-\u1e6caw\u0101\u1e25\u012bn) in southern Palestine. The Abbasids, led by A\u1e25mad ibn al-Muwaffa\u1e33 (the future Caliph al-Mu'tadid), had invaded Syria, and the governor of Damascus had defected to the enemy. After both Ahmad and Khumarawayh fled the battlefield, the \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bnid general Sa\u02bfd al-Aysar secured victory.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n*From 885\u2013886, the Tulunid forces, led by Khumarawayh, defeated [[Ishaq ibn Kundaj|Ibn Kund\u0101d\u0332j]], though the latter had superior numbers. A [[domino effect]] followed, as the [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]], [[Cilicia]] and regions as far east as [[Harran]] submitted to the Tulunid army. Peace treaties with the Tulunids put an end to the military campaigns.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n*From 896 to 905, after the emirate's demise  the Tulunids were unable to stop the Abbasids from taking their capital [[al-Qata'i]].<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\n==Economy==\nDuring the reign of Ahmad ibn Tulun, the Egyptian economy remained prosperous. There were propitious levels of agricultural production, stimulated by consistent high flooding of the Nile. Other industries, particularly [[textile]]s, also thrived. In his administration, ibn Tulun asserted his autonomy, refusing to pay taxes to the central Abbasid government in Baghdad. He also reformed the administration, aligning himself with the merchant community, and changing the taxation system. Under the Tulunids, there were also repairs in the agricultural infrastructure. The key sector of production, investment, and participation in their Mediterranean-wide commerce, was textiles, [[linen]] in particular (Frantz, 281-5).<ref name = EI1/> The financial bureaucracy throughout the Tulunid period was headed by members of the [[al-Madhara'i]] family.\n\n===Financial autonomy===\nDuring the period of 870\u2013872, Ibn Tulun asserted more control over Egypt's financial administration. In 871, he took control of the ''[[kharaj]]'' taxes as well as the ''[[thughur|thugh\u016br]]'' from Syria. He also achieved victory over Ibn al-Mudabbir, the head of the finance office and member of the Abbasid bureaucratic \u00e9lite.<ref name = EI1/>\n\nThe ''de facto'' ruler of the Abbasid caliphate, al-Muwaffak, took issue with Ibn Tulun's financial activities. He wanted to secure Egyptian revenue for his campaign against the [[Zanj]] rebellion (and perhaps limit the autonomy of the Tulunids). This pressing need for funds drew the attention of Baghdad to the considerably more wealthy Egypt.<ref name = EI1/> The situation came to a head in 877, when al-Muwaffak, upon not receiving the demanded funds, sent an army to depose Ahmad ibn Tulun.<ref name = Ahmad/> Nevertheless, on at least two occasions, Ibn Tulun remitted considerable sums of revenue, along with gifts, to the central Abbasid administration.<ref name = EI1/>\n\nUnder Ahmad's son, Khumarawayh, the Abbasids formally entered into a treaty with the Tulunids, thereby ending hostilities and resuming the payment of tribute. Financial provisions were made in the first treaty in 886 with al-Muwaffak. A second treaty with al-Mu\u02bfta\u1e0did, the son of al-Muwaffak, in 892, re-affirmed the political terms of the first. Financially, the Tulunids were to pay 300,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs (though this figure may be inaccurate) annually.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\n===Tulunid administration===\nThe T\u016bl\u016bnid administration over Egypt bore several notable features. The style of rule was highly centralized and \"pitiless\" in its execution. The administration was also backed by Egypt's commercial, religious and social \u00e9lite. Ahmad ibn Tulun replaced Iraqi officials with an Egyptian bureaucracy. Overall, the administration relied on the powerful merchant community for both financial and diplomatic support. For example, Ma\u02bfmar al-\u1e0ej\u0332awhar\u012b, a leading member of the merchant community in Egypt, served as Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn's financier.<ref name = EI1/>\n\nThe Tulunid administration also helped the economy prosper, by maintaining political stability, which in Egypt is a ''[[sine qua non]]''. Isolated revolts among the Copts and some Arab nomads in upper Egypt, which never threatened the dynasty's power, were actually a response to the more efficient Tulunid fiscal practices. The economy was strengthened by reforms introduced both immediately before the Tulunids and during their reign. There were changes in the tax assessment and collection system. There was also an expansion in the use of [[Tax farm|tax-contracts]], which were the source of an emergent land-holding \u00e9lite in this period.<ref name = EI1/> Ahmad ibn Tulun's agrarian and administrative reforms encouraged peasants to work their lands with zeal, despite the heavy taxes. He also terminated the exactions of the administration's officers for their personal profit.<ref name = Ahmad/>\n\nOne final feature of the administration under Ibn \u1e6c\u016bl\u016bn was the discontinuation of the practice of draining off the majority of his revenue to the metropolis. Instead, he initiated building programs to benefit other parts of Egypt. He also used those funds to stimulate commerce and industry.<ref name = Ahmad/>\n\n===Large expenditures===\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh inherited a stable economy and a wealthy [[polity]] from his father. The treasury was worth ten million d\u012bn\u0101rs at the young Tulunid's succession. When \u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh was killed in 896, the treasury was empty, and the dinar had sunk to one-third its value. Part of this financial disaster is attributed to his addiction to luxury, while squandering wealth to win loyalty was also another cause.<ref name = Khumarawayh/>\n\n\u1e34h\u0332um\u0101rawayh, unlike his father, spent lavishly. For example, he gave his daughter, \u1e32a\u1e6dr al-Nad\u0101, an extraordinary dowry of 400,000 - 1,000,000 d\u012bn\u0101rs, for her wedding in 892 to the Abbasid al-Mu\u02bfta\u1e0did. This move is speculated by some scholars to have been an attempt by the Abbasid to drain the Tulunid treasury.<ref name = EI1/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Sunni Muslim dynasties]]\n\n===Neighboring states===\n*[[Abbasid]]s\n*[[Byzantine empire]]\n*[[Makuria]]\n*[[Rustamids]]\n\n===Tulunid Amirs===\n{| width=100% class=\"wikitable\" \n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=9% | Titular Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=9% | Personal Name\n! style=\"background-color:#F0DC82\" width=9% | Reign \n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" | ''De facto'' autonomy from the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] during the reign of ''Caliph'' [[al-Mu'tamid]].\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| '''[[Ahmad ibn Tulun]]'''<br> <small>{{Nastaliq| \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646}}</small> \n|align=\"center\"|868 - 884 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| ''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Jaysh''<br><small>{{Nastaliq| \u0627\u0628\u0648 \u062c\u06cc\u0634}}</small><br>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Khumarawayh ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]] <br> <small>{{Nastaliq|\u062e\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 }} </small>\n|align=\"center\"|884 - 896 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Ashir ''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u06cc\u0631 }}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Asakir ''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0627\u0643\u0631}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Abu 'l-Asakir Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh|Jaysh ibn Khumarawayh]]<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u062c\u06cc\u0634 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062e\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 }}</small><br>\n|align=\"center\"|896 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"| ''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu Musa''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u06cc}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Harun ibn Khumarawayh]]<br> <small>{{Nastaliq|\u06c1\u0627\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u062e\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 }}</small>\n|align=\"center\"|896 - 904 CE\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|''Amir''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0623\u0645\u06cc\u0631}}</small><br>''Abu 'l-Manaqib''<br><small>{{Nastaliq|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0628}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"| [[Shayban ibn Ahmad ibn Tulun]]<br> <small>{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u0627\u0626\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0637\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646}}</small>\n|align=\"center\"|904 - 905 CE\n|-\n|- bgcolor=\"#F5DEB3\"\n| colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |  Re-conquered by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] during the reign of Caliph [[al-Muktafi]] by general Muhammad ibn Sulayman.\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal |title=The Emergence of Muslim Rule in India: Some Historical Disconnects and Missing Links |first=Tanvir |last=Anjum |journal=Islamic Studies |publisher=Islamic Research Institute |volume=46 |issue=2 |year=2007 |pages=217\u2013240 [p. 233] |jstor=20839068 |ref=harv }}\n*Behrens-Abouseif, Doris (1989). \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090305144249/http://archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/6405/doc/DPC0530.pdf Early Islamic Architecture in Cairo]\".

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]].

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (miniseries)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed.

He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice (TV series)|Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''[[Bonnie (TV series)|Bonnie]]'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (miniseries)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Jacqueline Susann's Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice (TV series)|Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''[[Bonnie (TV series)|Bonnie]]'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.
