In 2012, Khan later implicated [[Benazir Bhutto]] in proliferation matters, pointing out to the fact as she had issued \"clear directions in thi[s] regard.\" Domestically it is believed by some that Khan was made a [[scapegoat]] by President Musharraf to prove his uttermost loyalty to the West whose support was urgently and desperately needed for the survival of his presidency.<ref name=\"The New Yorker\"/> It was done so to protect the names of those high-ranking military officials and civilian politicians, under whom Musharraf served in the past.<ref name=\"The New Yorker\"/>\n\n==Government work and political advocacy==\n\nControversial, Qadeer Khan was [[Social rejection|ostracised]] by much of the scientific community, but still quite welcome in military science circles.

He often served as Pakistan's extreme national pride, and his long association with science bought Khan a tremendous popularity. In the late 1980s, Abdul Qadeer Khan promoted the funding of the Pakistan's [[Pakistani missile research and development program|integrated space weapons project]] and vigorously supported, and supervised the [[Hatf-I]] and [[Ghauri (missile)|''Ghauri-I'']] program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://draqkhan.com.pk/index.php/2008/11/the-past-and-the-present-12-nov-2008/#more-3 |title=The past and the present (12-Nov-2008) |publisher=A.

The [[Embassy of the United States, Islamabad|US Embassy]] had pointed out that the [[Tariq Majid|successor]] of Musharraf could be less friendly towards the United States; this restrained the United States from applying further [[Political pressure|''direct'' pressure]] on Musharraf due to a strategic calculation that may led the loss of Musharraf as an ally.\n\nStrong calls were made by many senior IAEA officials, [[United States|U.S.]] and [[European Commission]] politicians, have Khan interrogated by IAEA investigators, given the lingering scepticism about the disclosures made by Pakistan regarding Khan's activities. All such requests were however strongly dismissed by the Prime minister [[Shaukat Aziz]] and the [[Government of Pakistan|Pakistan government]], terming it as \"case closed\".\n\nIn December 2006, the [[Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission|WMDC]] headed by [[Hans Blix]], a former IAEA chief and [[UNMOVIC]] chief; said in a report that Abdul Qadeer Khan could not have acted alone \"without the awareness of the Pakistan Government\".<ref>[http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/dec82006/foreign2156302006127.asp \"A Q Khan did not act alone\" says Hans Blix team]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Blix's statement was also reciprocated by the United States government, with one anonymous American government intelligence official quoting to independent journalist and author [[Seymour Hersh]]: \"Suppose if [[Edward Teller]] had suddenly decided to spread nuclear technology around the world.

In 2012, Khan later implicated [[Benazir Bhutto]] in proliferation matters, pointing out to the fact as she had issued \"clear directions in thi[s] regard.\" Domestically it is believed by some that Khan was made a [[scapegoat]] by President Musharraf to prove his uttermost loyalty to the West whose support was urgently and desperately needed for the survival of his presidency.<ref name=\"The New Yorker\"/> It was done so to protect the names of those high-ranking military officials and civilian politicians, under whom Musharraf served in the past.<ref name=\"The New Yorker\"/>\n\n==Government work and political advocacy==\n\nControversial, Qadeer Khan was [[Social rejection|ostracised]] by much of the scientific community, but still quite welcome in military science circles. In 2001, Musharraf promoted Abdul Qadeer Khan to [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)#Science Advisors|Science Adviser to the President]].<ref name=\"International Institute for Strategic Studies (ISSI)\"/>\n\nAbdul Qadeer Khan remains a popular figure and many saw him as national hero of Pakistan. He often served as Pakistan's extreme national pride, and his long association with science bought Khan a tremendous popularity. In the late 1980s, Abdul Qadeer Khan promoted the funding of the Pakistan's [[Pakistani missile research and development program|integrated space weapons project]] and vigorously supported, and supervised the [[Hatf-I]] and [[Ghauri (missile)|''Ghauri-I'']] program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://draqkhan.com.pk/index.php/2008/11/the-past-and-the-present-12-nov-2008/#more-3 |title=The past and the present (12-Nov-2008) |publisher=A.

As he wakes up in Claras apartment and begins his routine of working in the main lobby, Ursula, the daughter of another tenant, receives hush money from Cesar. Cesar visits his mom who is at the hospital and is awfully sick practically unable to speak to his son but listen to him talk about Clara. Veronica who is another tenant of Cesar asks him for a favor to take care of her dogs giving detailed directions on how to feed them. Entrusted to feed them, Cesar breaking her directions and feeds Rocio a slice of pie. Clara entering her apartment opens up letters she has received then tears them and throws them away all while Cesar is hiding under her bed waiting for her to fall asleep in order to use chloroform to keep her asleep so he can maliciously mess with her care product. It is the morning after sneaks out of Clara\u2019s apartment with Ursula waiting outside and demands that she will keep her mouth shut if Cesar provides her with an adult movie.

It successfully proved the concept of ducted lift fans, but the project was cancelled after multiple fatal crashes unrelated to the lift system. \n\n==Design==\n[[File:loueverett06.web.jpg|thumb|right|upright|XV-5A Models.]]\nThe XV-5 was powered by two {{convert|2,658|lbf|kN|abbr=on|1}} thrust [[General Electric J85|General Electric J85-GE-5]] [[turbojet]]s. [[General Electric X353-5]] Lift-fans in the wings and a smaller fan in the nose, powered by engine exhaust gas, were used for [[VTOL|Vertical Take-Off and Landing]] (VTOL).

The engine power setting determined the lift from the fans, as fan RPM was determined by the exhaust output from the J85 engines and the load on the fan.<ref name=\"gerdes\"/> Roll control was by differential actuation of the wing-fan exit louvers.\n\nAircraft performance was subsonic, with delta wings superficially similar to those on the [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk]]. The Vertifan had an unusual intake position above the two-seat [[Tandem#Side-by-side seating|side-by-side seating]] cockpit, and a [[T-tail]].\n\nThe XV-5A was finished in Army green and the XV-5B was painted in white NASA colors. The fans did not generate as much thrust as was hoped, and the vertical-horizontal flight transition was difficult and abrupt. The XV-5 would be one of the last manned aircraft designed and built by Ryan, which mainly manufactured drones after the mid 1960s.\n\nThe XV-5 was one of many dozens of aircraft which attempted to produce a successful vertical takeoff aircraft, but the lift fan system was heavy and occupied considerable internal volume. Only the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]] would still be operational by the turn of the 21st century, as would technology to make possible the use of a shaft-driven fan in the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|Lockheed Martin F-35B]].\n\n===Propulsion system===\nThe J85 and lift-fan combination was a precursor to developments which led to the first GE high BPR engine, the TF-39.<ref name=\"rowe\">\"The Power to Fly\" Brian H.

The concept of a large diameter cruise fan was incorporated in the [[General Electric TF39]] engine, used on the [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]].<ref>\"Seven Decades of Progress\" General Electric, Aero Publishers Inc. {{ISBN|0-8168-8355-6}}</ref>\n\n== Operational history ==\n[[File:xv5b01.jpg|thumb|right|XV-5B.]]\n[[File:xv5b05.jpg|thumb|upright|XV-5B.]]\nTwo 12,500&nbsp;lb (maximum gross weight) XV-5A were evaluated in late 1966 by fifteen test pilots (the \"XV-5A Fan Club\"). One was destroyed in a crash during a public flight demonstration on 27 April 1965, killing [[Ryan Aeronautical|Ryan]] test pilot [[Lou Everett]]. The crash investigation believed that the pilot had inadvertently tripped the conventional-to-vertical conversion switch (improperly mounted on the collective), which auto-programmed the horizontal stabilizer to force the nose down almost 45 degrees. (This was to compensate for the lift generated by the nose fan.) Everett initiated a low-altitude rocket ejection, but the ejection seat was improperly rigged and he was killed. As a result of this accident, the conversion switch was changed to a lift-lock toggle and relocated on the main instrument panel ahead of the collective lever control.<ref name=\"gerdes\">\"Lift-Fan Aircraft-Lessons Learned The Pilot's Perspective\" Ronald M. Gerdes, NASA Contractor Report 177620August 1993</ref> \n\nThe aircraft was difficult to control during landing for several reasons. Yaw control was provided by changing the angle of the lift fans in opposing directions, but this proved to have far too little yaw control for precise low speed handling. The duct doors also caused difficulty with control, as even at low speeds opening them caused significant changes in pitch. The aircraft also suffered from very poor acceleration during standard runway takeoffs.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book |title=Memoirs of an aeronautical engineer: flight testing at Ames Research Center |first=Seth B. |last=Anderson |location=United States |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. History Office, [[Ames Research Center]] |page=35}}</ref> \n\nTests and promotional materials proposed a rescue version that could winch a person into a compartment behind the pilots. The second aircraft was extensively damaged on October 5, 1966 during trials as a rescue aircraft, when a suspended \"horse collar\" survivor sling was ingested into a wing fan.<ref>{{YouTube|id=wi9yfqRj86w|title=Ryan XV-5A Vertifan VTOL Jet Crash Accident October 5, 1966; Pilot Major David H. Tittle Killed }}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref> The pilot, Major David H. Tittle, was fatally injured as a result of the [[ejection seat]] propelling him out of the craft after it had hit the concrete airport surface, although it was judged that the fan actually still functioned well enough to continue controlled flight. The second aircraft was rebuilt as the modified XV-5B, with tests continuing until 1971. An XV-5B can be seen on display at the [[United States Army Aviation Museum]], [[Fort Rucker]], [[Alabama]].\n\nAlthough the program was cancelled, the ducted fan concept had been judged successful and several follow up programs were proposed. The ducted fans were considered very quiet for their time, and were capable of operating from standard surface materials. Other VTOL aircraft often require protective mats to avoid damaging ground surfaces with their exhaust. This is not a problem with the much cooler exhaust from ducted fans.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/>\n\n==Variants==\n;XV-5A: Two aircraft built in the initial build standard.\n;XV-5B: The second XV-5A re-built after a fatal crash with improved controls, fixed wide-track undercarriage and up-rated lift/propulsion systems.\n\n== Specifications (XV-5) (performance estimated)==\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=Jane's All The World's Aircraft 1965\u201366<ref name=JAWA65-66>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John W.R.

The duct doors also caused difficulty with control, as even at low speeds opening them caused significant changes in pitch. The aircraft also suffered from very poor acceleration during standard runway takeoffs.<ref name=\"Anderson\">{{cite book |title=Memoirs of an aeronautical engineer: flight testing at Ames Research Center |first=Seth B. |last=Anderson |location=United States |publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]].

The second aircraft was extensively damaged on October 5, 1966 during trials as a rescue aircraft, when a suspended \"horse collar\" survivor sling was ingested into a wing fan.<ref>{{YouTube|id=wi9yfqRj86w|title=Ryan XV-5A Vertifan VTOL Jet Crash Accident October 5, 1966; Pilot Major David H. Tittle Killed }}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref> The pilot, Major David H. Tittle, was fatally injured as a result of the [[ejection seat]] propelling him out of the craft after it had hit the concrete airport surface, although it was judged that the fan actually still functioned well enough to continue controlled flight. The second aircraft was rebuilt as the modified XV-5B, with tests continuing until 1971. An XV-5B can be seen on display at the [[United States Army Aviation Museum]], [[Fort Rucker]], [[Alabama]].\n\nAlthough the program was cancelled, the ducted fan concept had been judged successful and several follow up programs were proposed. The ducted fans were considered very quiet for their time, and were capable of operating from standard surface materials. Other VTOL aircraft often require protective mats to avoid damaging ground surfaces with their exhaust. This is not a problem with the much cooler exhaust from ducted fans.<ref name=\"Anderson\"/>\n\n==Variants==\n;XV-5A: Two aircraft built in the initial build standard.\n;XV-5B: The second XV-5A re-built after a fatal crash with improved controls, fixed wide-track undercarriage and up-rated lift/propulsion systems.\n\n== Specifications (XV-5) (performance estimated)==\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=Jane's All The World's Aircraft 1965\u201366<ref name=JAWA65-66>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=John W.R.
