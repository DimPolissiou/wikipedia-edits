It was first released on August 28, 2009 through [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] in Europe, then August 31, 2009 with [[Arista Records]] in the United States before being released by [[RCA Records]] in the United Kingdom on October 19, 2009. The album was Houston's first studio album since 2002's ''[[Just Whitney]]''.\n\nIt received favorable reviews from music critics, based on an aggregate score of 66/100 from [[Metacritic]] and debuted on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number one with sales of 305,000, beating her previous career best first-week sale of 205,137 units with ''[[Just Whitney]]'' (2002), and it was her first album to reach number one in the US since 1992's ''[[The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album|The Bodyguard]]''. Additionally it became her fourth chart-topping album, thus extending her as the female artist with the most cumulative weeks at the number one position.\n\nIt has spawned two official singles: The [[I Look to You (song)|title song]], which became a top 20 [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|US R&B chart]] single, and the international single \"[[Million Dollar Bill]]\", which hit the top ten in several countries worldwide and also becoming a US top 20 R&B hit. Since its release, ''I Look to You'' has gone on to sell over 2.5 million copies worldwide, earning platinum [[Music recording sales certification|certification]] in seven countries and gold certification in eight. A promotional single, \"Nothin' But Love\", taken from the album, was only released to UK radio stations to promote the accompanying [[Nothing but Love World Tour]].\n\n==Background==\n''I Look to You'' had first been conceived in 2007 with recording and production taking place in 2008, as said Houston during her Los Angeles album listening party in 2009.<ref name=laparty/> Rumor of Houston's return to music were first circulated at the start of 2007 and were then substantiated when record label boss and close mentor [[Clive Davis]] confirmed that he would personally be involved in the project whilst speaking on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. In February 2009, Houston appeared on stage at Davis's \"Pre-Grammy Gala\" where she performed a four-song set comprising \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\", \"[[I Believe in You and Me]]\", \"[[It's Not Right but It's Okay]]\", and a rousing version of \"[[I'm Every Woman]]\". Onlookers included her mother [[Cissy Houston]], musicians [[Paul McCartney]], [[Jamie Foxx]] and [[Barry Manilow]] as well as actors [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]].<ref name=pregrammy>{{cite web |url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b99016_whitney_houston_we_dont_have_problem.html |title=Whitney Houston we don't have a problem |work=[[E!Online|E!

It was first released on August 28, 2009 through [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] in Europe, then August 31, 2009 with [[Arista Records]] in the United States before being released by [[RCA Records]] in the United Kingdom on October 19, 2009. The album was Houston's first studio album since 2002's ''[[Just Whitney]]''.\n\nIt received favorable reviews from music critics, based on an aggregate score of 66/100 from [[Metacritic]] and debuted on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number one with sales of 305,000, beating her previous career best first-week sale of 205,137 units with ''[[Just Whitney]]'' (2002), and it was her first album to reach number one in the US since 1992's ''[[The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album|The Bodyguard]]''. Additionally it became her fourth chart-topping album, thus extending her as the female artist with the most cumulative weeks at the number one position.\n\nIt has spawned two official singles: The [[I Look to You (song)|title song]], which became a top 20 [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|US R&B chart]] single, and the international single \"[[Million Dollar Bill]]\", which hit the top ten in several countries worldwide and also becoming a US top 20 R&B hit. Since its release, ''I Look to You'' has gone on to sell over 2.5 million copies worldwide, earning platinum [[Music recording sales certification|certification]] in seven countries and gold certification in eight. A promotional single, \"Nothin' But Love\", taken from the album, was only released to UK radio stations to promote the accompanying [[Nothing but Love World Tour]].\n\n==Background==\n''I Look to You'' had first been conceived in 2007 with recording and production taking place in 2008, as said Houston during her Los Angeles album listening party in 2009.<ref name=laparty/> Rumor of Houston's return to music were first circulated at the start of 2007 and were then substantiated when record label boss and close mentor [[Clive Davis]] confirmed that he would personally be involved in the project whilst speaking on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. In February 2009, Houston appeared on stage at Davis's \"Pre-Grammy Gala\" where she performed a four-song set comprising \"[[I Will Always Love You]]\", \"[[I Believe in You and Me]]\", \"[[It's Not Right but It's Okay]]\", and a rousing version of \"[[I'm Every Woman]]\". Onlookers included her mother [[Cissy Houston]], musicians [[Paul McCartney]], [[Jamie Foxx]] and [[Barry Manilow]] as well as actors [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Sylvester Stallone]].<ref name=pregrammy>{{cite web |url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b99016_whitney_houston_we_dont_have_problem.html |title=Whitney Houston we don't have a problem |work=[[E!Online|E!

She said \"That makes it real. The changes that we go through, the transitions that we go through, the tests that we go through, being a mother, becoming a single mother. It all had its ups and its downs, but for the most part, I kept my faith and I kept my head up... I took my time.

whether that will or will not happen. If a customer believes the price of an underlying asset will be above a certain price at a set time, the trader buys the binary option, but if he or she believes it will be below that price, they sell the option. In the U.S. exchanges, the price of a binary is always under $100.<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/>\n\n[[Investopedia]] described the binary options trading process in the U.S. thus:\n\n<blockquote>[A] binary may be trading at $42.50 (bid) and $44.50 (offer) at 1 p.m. If you buy the binary option right then you will pay $44.50, if you decide to sell right then you'll sell at $42.50.\n\nLet's assume you decide to buy at $44.50. If at 1:30 p.m. the price of gold is above $1,250, your option expires and it becomes worth $100. You make a profit of $100 - $44.50 = $55.50 (less fees). This is called being \"in the money.\"\n\nBut if the price of gold is below $1,250 at 1:30 p.m., the option expires at $0. Therefore you lose the $44.50 invested. This is called being \"out of the money.\"\n\nThe bid and offer fluctuate until the option expires. You can close your position at any time before expiry to lock in a profit or a reduce a loss (compared to letting it expire out of the money).<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn the U.S., every binary option settles at $100 or $0, $100 if the bet is correct, 0 if it is not.<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/>\n\nIn the online binary options industry, where the contracts are sold by a broker to a customer in an [[Over-the-counter (finance)|OTC]] manner, a different option pricing model is used. Brokers sell binary options at a fixed price (e.g., $100) and offer some fixed percentage return in case of in-the-money settlement. Some brokers, also offer a sort of out-of-money reward to a losing customer. For example, with a win reward of 80%, out-of-money reward of 5%, and the option price of $100, two scenarios are possible. In-the-money settlement pays back the option price of $100 and the reward of $80. In case of loss, the option price is not returned but the out-of-money reward of $5 is granted to the customer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broker\u2019s Edge Calculator|url=https://www.binarytrading.com/brokers-edge-calculator/|website=BinaryTrading|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn non-regulated platforms, client money is not necessarily kept in a trust account, as required by government [[financial regulation]], and transactions are not monitored by third parties in order to ensure fair play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fma.gv.at/download.php?d=2747|title=FMA Focus Binary Options and CFDs|publisher=[[Financial Market Authority (Austria)]]|format=PDF|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nBinary options are often considered a form of gambling rather than investment because of their negative cumulative payout (the brokers have an edge over the investor) and because they are advertised as requiring little or no knowledge of the markets. [[Gordon Pape]], writing in ''[[Forbes]]''.com in 2010, called binary options websites \"gambling sites, pure and simple\", and said \"this sort of thing can quickly become addictive... no one, no matter how knowledgeable, can consistently predict what a stock or commodity will do within a short time frame\".<ref name=\"Forbes\" />\n\nPape observed that binary options are poor from a gambling standpoint as well because of the excessive \"house edge\".

Similarly, paying out 1 unit of the foreign currency if the spot at maturity is above or below the strike is exactly like an asset-or nothing call and put respectively.\nHence if we now take <math>r_{\\mathrm{FOR}}</math>, the foreign interest rate, <math>r_{DOM}</math>, the domestic interest rate, and the rest as above, we get the following results.\n\nIn case of a digital call (this is a call FOR/put DOM) paying out one unit of the domestic currency we get as present value,\n:<math> C = e^{-r_{\\mathrm{DOM}} T}\\Phi(d_2) \\,</math>\nIn case of a digital put (this is a put FOR/call DOM) paying out one unit of the domestic currency we get as present value,\n:<math> P = e^{-r_{\\mathrm{DOM}}T}\\Phi(-d_2) \\,</math>\nWhile in case of a digital call (this is a call FOR/put DOM) paying out one unit of the foreign currency we get as present value,\n:<math> C = Se^{-r_{\\mathrm{FOR}} T}\\Phi(d_1) \\,</math>\nand in case of a digital put (this is a put FOR/call DOM) paying out one unit of the foreign currency we get as present value,\n:<math> P = Se^{-r_{\\mathrm{FOR}}T}\\Phi(-d_1) \\,</math>\n\n===Skew===\nIn the standard Black\u2013Scholes model, one can interpret the premium of the binary option in the risk-neutral world as the expected value = probability of being in-the-money * unit, discounted to the present value. The Black\u2013Scholes model relies on symmetry of distribution and ignores the [[skewness]] of the distribution of the asset. Market makers adjust for such skewness by, instead of using a single standard deviation for the underlying asset <math>\\sigma</math> across all strikes, incorporating a variable one <math>\\sigma(K)</math> where volatility depends on strike price, thus incorporating the [[volatility skew]] into account. The skew matters because it affects the binary considerably more than the regular options.\n\nA binary call option is, at long expirations, similar to a tight call spread using two vanilla options. One can model the value of a binary cash-or-nothing option, ''C'', at strike ''K'', as an infinitesimally tight spread, where <math>C_v</math> is a vanilla European call:<ref name=\"Breeden, D. T. 1978\"/><ref name=\"Gatheral, J. 2006\"/>\n:<math> C = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{C_v(K-\\epsilon) - C_v(K)}{\\epsilon} </math>\nThus, the value of a binary call is the negative of the [[derivative]] of the price of a vanilla call with respect to strike price:\n:<math> C = -\\frac{dC_v}{dK} </math>\n\nWhen one takes volatility skew into account, <math>\\sigma</math> is a function of <math>K</math>:\n:<math> C = -\\frac{dC_v(K,\\sigma(K))}{dK} = -\\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial K} - \\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial \\sigma} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial K}</math>\n\nThe first term is equal to the premium of the binary option ignoring skew:\n:<math> -\\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial K} = -\\frac{\\partial (S\\Phi(d_1) - Ke^{-rT}\\Phi(d_2))}{\\partial K} = e^{-rT}\\Phi(d_2) = C_{\\mathrm{noskew}}</math>\n\n<math>\\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial \\sigma}</math> is the [[Greeks (finance)|Vega]] of the vanilla call; <math>\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial K}</math> is sometimes called the \"skew slope\" or just \"skew\". Skew is typically negative, so the value of a binary call is higher when taking skew into account.\n:<math> C = C_{\\mathrm{noskew}} - \\mathrm{Vega}_v * \\mathrm{Skew}</math>\n\n===Relationship to vanilla options' Greeks===\nSince a binary call is a mathematical derivative of a vanilla call with respect to strike, the price of a binary call has the same shape as the delta of a vanilla call, and the delta of a binary call has the same shape as the gamma of a vanilla call.\n\n==Regulation and fraud==\n{{further|Securities fraud}}\n\nMany binary option \"brokers\" have been exposed as fraudulent operations.<ref name=\"SEC1\"/> In those cases, there is no real [[brokerage]]; the customer is betting against the broker, who is acting as a [[Bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shop]].

whether that will or will not happen. If a customer believes the price of an underlying asset will be above a certain price at a set time, the trader buys the binary option, but if he or she believes it will be below that price, they sell the option. In the U.S. exchanges, the price of a binary is always under $100.<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/>\n\n[[Investopedia]] described the binary options trading process in the U.S. thus:\n\n<blockquote>[A] binary may be trading at $42.50 (bid) and $44.50 (offer) at 1 p.m. If you buy the binary option right then you will pay $44.50, if you decide to sell right then you'll sell at $42.50.\n\nLet's assume you decide to buy at $44.50. If at 1:30 p.m. the price of gold is above $1,250, your option expires and it becomes worth $100. You make a profit of $100 - $44.50 = $55.50 (less fees). This is called being \"in the money.\"\n\nBut if the price of gold is below $1,250 at 1:30 p.m., the option expires at $0. Therefore you lose the $44.50 invested. This is called being \"out of the money.\"\n\nThe bid and offer fluctuate until the option expires. You can close your position at any time before expiry to lock in a profit or a reduce a loss (compared to letting it expire out of the money).<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn the U.S., every binary option settles at $100 or $0, $100 if the bet is correct, 0 if it is not.<ref name=\"investopedia-guide\"/>\n\nIn the online binary options industry, where the contracts are sold by a broker to a customer in an [[Over-the-counter (finance)|OTC]] manner, a different option pricing model is used. Brokers sell binary options at a fixed price (e.g., $100) and offer some fixed percentage return in case of in-the-money settlement. Some brokers, also offer a sort of out-of-money reward to a losing customer. For example, with a win reward of 80%, out-of-money reward of 5%, and the option price of $100, two scenarios are possible. In-the-money settlement pays back the option price of $100 and the reward of $80. In case of loss, the option price is not returned but the out-of-money reward of $5 is granted to the customer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broker\u2019s Edge Calculator|url=https://www.binarytrading.com/brokers-edge-calculator/|website=BinaryTrading|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn non-regulated platforms, client money is not necessarily kept in a trust account, as required by government [[financial regulation]], and transactions are not monitored by third parties in order to ensure fair play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fma.gv.at/download.php?d=2747|title=FMA Focus Binary Options and CFDs|publisher=[[Financial Market Authority (Austria)]]|format=PDF|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nBinary options are often considered a form of gambling rather than investment because of their negative cumulative payout (the brokers have an edge over the investor) and because they are advertised as requiring little or no knowledge of the markets. [[Gordon Pape]], writing in ''[[Forbes]]''.com in 2010, called binary options websites \"gambling sites, pure and simple\", and said \"this sort of thing can quickly become addictive... no one, no matter how knowledgeable, can consistently predict what a stock or commodity will do within a short time frame\".<ref name=\"Forbes\" />\n\nPape observed that binary options are poor from a gambling standpoint as well because of the excessive \"house edge\". One online binary options site paid $71 for each successful $100 trade. \"If you lose, you get back $15. Let's say you make 1,000 \"trades\" and win 545 of them. Your profit is $38,695.

Similarly, paying out 1 unit of the foreign currency if the spot at maturity is above or below the strike is exactly like an asset-or nothing call and put respectively.\nHence if we now take <math>r_{\\mathrm{FOR}}</math>, the foreign interest rate, <math>r_{DOM}</math>, the domestic interest rate, and the rest as above, we get the following results.\n\nIn case of a digital call (this is a call FOR/put DOM) paying out one unit of the domestic currency we get as present value,\n:<math> C = e^{-r_{\\mathrm{DOM}} T}\\Phi(d_2) \\,</math>\nIn case of a digital put (this is a put FOR/call DOM) paying out one unit of the domestic currency we get as present value,\n:<math> P = e^{-r_{\\mathrm{DOM}}T}\\Phi(-d_2) \\,</math>\nWhile in case of a digital call (this is a call FOR/put DOM) paying out one unit of the foreign currency we get as present value,\n:<math> C = Se^{-r_{\\mathrm{FOR}} T}\\Phi(d_1) \\,</math>\nand in case of a digital put (this is a put FOR/call DOM) paying out one unit of the foreign currency we get as present value,\n:<math> P = Se^{-r_{\\mathrm{FOR}}T}\\Phi(-d_1) \\,</math>\n\n===Skew===\nIn the standard Black\u2013Scholes model, one can interpret the premium of the binary option in the risk-neutral world as the expected value = probability of being in-the-money * unit, discounted to the present value. The Black\u2013Scholes model relies on symmetry of distribution and ignores the [[skewness]] of the distribution of the asset. Market makers adjust for such skewness by, instead of using a single standard deviation for the underlying asset <math>\\sigma</math> across all strikes, incorporating a variable one <math>\\sigma(K)</math> where volatility depends on strike price, thus incorporating the [[volatility skew]] into account. The skew matters because it affects the binary considerably more than the regular options.\n\nA binary call option is, at long expirations, similar to a tight call spread using two vanilla options. One can model the value of a binary cash-or-nothing option, ''C'', at strike ''K'', as an infinitesimally tight spread, where <math>C_v</math> is a vanilla European call:<ref name=\"Breeden, D. T. 1978\"/><ref name=\"Gatheral, J. 2006\"/>\n:<math> C = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{C_v(K-\\epsilon) - C_v(K)}{\\epsilon} </math>\nThus, the value of a binary call is the negative of the [[derivative]] of the price of a vanilla call with respect to strike price:\n:<math> C = -\\frac{dC_v}{dK} </math>\n\nWhen one takes volatility skew into account, <math>\\sigma</math> is a function of <math>K</math>:\n:<math> C = -\\frac{dC_v(K,\\sigma(K))}{dK} = -\\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial K} - \\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial \\sigma} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial K}</math>\n\nThe first term is equal to the premium of the binary option ignoring skew:\n:<math> -\\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial K} = -\\frac{\\partial (S\\Phi(d_1) - Ke^{-rT}\\Phi(d_2))}{\\partial K} = e^{-rT}\\Phi(d_2) = C_{\\mathrm{noskew}}</math>\n\n<math>\\frac{\\partial C_v}{\\partial \\sigma}</math> is the [[Greeks (finance)|Vega]] of the vanilla call; <math>\\frac{\\partial \\sigma}{\\partial K}</math> is sometimes called the \"skew slope\" or just \"skew\". Skew is typically negative, so the value of a binary call is higher when taking skew into account.\n:<math> C = C_{\\mathrm{noskew}} - \\mathrm{Vega}_v * \\mathrm{Skew}</math>\n\n===Relationship to vanilla options' Greeks===\nSince a binary call is a mathematical derivative of a vanilla call with respect to strike, the price of a binary call has the same shape as the delta of a vanilla call, and the delta of a binary call has the same shape as the gamma of a vanilla call.\n\n==Regulation and fraud==\n{{further|Securities fraud}}\n\nMany binary option \"brokers\" have been exposed as fraudulent operations.<ref name=\"SEC1\"/> In those cases, there is no real [[brokerage]]; the customer is betting against the broker, who is acting as a [[Bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shop]].

Other users could then decide to mirror-copy on their account all the transactions generated from that strategy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://investingoal.com/social-trading/the-history/ |title=The Social Trading history |accessdate=December 11, 2017 |author=Fillipo |publisher=InvestinGoal}}</ref>\n\nThis was soon followed in certain circumstances that allowed traders to connect their personal trading account directly in the platform, and from that moment each of their action was recorded and made available to the users without the need for submitting the trading strategy.\n\nSince 2010, it has become an increasingly popular feature among online [[financial trading]] brokers as a way to enable less experienced traders to benefit from the trading decisions of investors whom they deem successful.\n\n=== Study ===\nIn 2012 [[MIT]] funded a study directed by [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr. Yaniv Altshuler]], showed that traders on the [[eToro]] social investment network who benefited from \"guided copying\", i.e. copying a suggested investor, fared 6-10% better than traders who were trading manually, and 4% better than traders who were copy trading random investors of their choice.<ref name=\"Altshuler\">[http://www.media.mit.edu/research/highlights/tuning-social-networks-gain-wisdom-crowd  MIT study 2012]</ref>\n\nAs of 2013, [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr. Altshuler]] has been collaborating with Professor [[Alex Pentland|Alex \"Sandy\" Pentland]] of MIT on a study that aims to find a \"sustainable\" social trading mechanism in the aim of fine tuning traders' ability to benefit from copy trading.\n\n=== Regulatory issues ===\nIn 2014, the United Kingdom [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA) has raised concerns regarding copy trading as they deem the firms offer copy trading to be effectively unregulated investment managers. As such, the FCA has sent letters to those companies providing copy trading services notifying them of their intention to classify them as investment managers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/copy-trading |title=Copy trading |date=May 12, 2015 |publisher=UK [[Financial Conduct Authority]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/fa905d08-a606-11e3-b9ed-00144feab7de |title=UK\u2019s financial regulator warns on copy trading |date=March 11, 2014 |publisher=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\n== Methods used ==\nDifferent copy trading platforms employ different copy trading logic. These usually vary in regards to the minimum copy trading amounts, the minimum amount for a copied trade, and the way money in/out operations on behalf of the copied trader are reflected in the proportions between the copied-copying accounts.\n\nSome platforms also enable traders to place Stop Loss orders on the entire copy trading relationship, allowing traders to control the risk of their copy trading activity based on the individual copied investors\n\n== Compared to social trading ==\nVarious financial trading operators offer copy trading capabilities as part of a larger [[social trading]] platform. [[Social trading]] usually includes the ability to connect with other investors using the platform in social ways (comments, likes, link sharing etc.) as well as find potential copy trading candidates by viewing investors' performance statistics.\n\nSome platforms also provide ways to sort and rank traders according to certain performance parameters, thus making it easier for traders to find potential investors to copy.  Typically, trading histories of available traders to copy are available along with detailed performance and risk metrics.{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Financial markets]]\n[[Category:Algorithmic trading]]\n", "name_user": "Pucidanuna", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added sources", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_trading"}

A [[Video game remake|remake].  \n\nCapcom considered remaking ''Resident Evil 2'' following the successful release of [[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|the remake of the first ''Resident Evil'']] in 2002. It was delayed as series creator [[Shinji Mikami]] did not want to divert development from ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005). Capcom announced the ''Resident Evil 2'' remake in August 2015, and released the first trailer and gameplay footage at [[E3 2018]].\n\n''Resident Evil 2'' received acclaim, with praise for its presentation, gameplay, and faithfulness to the original. It was nominated for several awards, including numerous [[game of the year|\"game of the year]]\" awards. By December 2019, it had sold over 5.8 million copies, outselling the original.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Resident Evil 2 Remake gameplay.png|left|thumb|[[Claire Redfield]] is one of the game's two main playable characters.]]\n''Resident Evil 2'' is a remake of the 1998 game [[Resident Evil 2|of the same name]]. Unlike the original, which uses [[tank controls]] and fixed camera angles, the re-imagining features \"over-the-shoulder\" [[third-person shooter]] gameplay similar to ''[[Resident Evil&nbsp;4]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-resident-evil-2-remake-is-familiar-but-ter/1100-6459801/|title=E3 2018: Resident Evil 2 Remake Is Familiar But Terrifying In New Ways|last=Espineli|first=Matt|date=June 12, 2018|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=June 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613084807/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-resident-evil-2-remake-is-familiar-but-ter/1100-6459801/|archive-date=June 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the standard difficulty mode allows players to save as often as they would like inside safe rooms. If the player chooses to play on \"Hardcore\" difficulty, players will be required to collect and use a finite number of ink ribbons to save the game's progress, much like in the original game.\n\nAs with the original game, the remake of ''Resident Evil 2'' offers the option to play through the main campaign with one of two protagonists, the rookie cop [[Leon S. Kennedy]] or the college student [[Claire Redfield]]. Depending on the player's choice, the main story will be experienced with variations in subplots, accessible areas, and obtainable items.\n\nSimilar to the \"Scenario B\" feature of the original game, beating the main campaign for the first time unlocks the option to play through a \"2nd Run\" as the other protagonist. 2nd Run is a variation of the main campaign that adds additional content to frame the second playthrough as occurring concurrently with the first playthrough. For example, the protagonist in 2nd Run will enter the police station from a different entrance and find several doors already unlocked by the protagonist from the first playthrough. Completing 2nd Run is also required to experience the true ending of the main campaign.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe game is set in Raccoon City in September 1998, two months after the events of ''[[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|Resident Evil]]''. Most of the citizens have been turned into mindless creatures, referred to by survivors as zombies, due to an outbreak of a viral [[bioweapon]] known as the [[T-Virus]], manufactured by [[Umbrella Corporation]].<ref name=\"characters\">{{cite book|title=Resident Evil Archives|date=November 9, 2005|publisher=[[BradyGames Publishing]]|isbn=0-7440-0655-4|pages=117\u2013121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Resident Evil Archives|date=November 9, 2005|publisher=[[BradyGames Publishing]]|isbn=0-7440-0655-4|page=253}}</ref> The game begins at a [[gas station]] outside of the city, where rookie police officer [[Leon S. Kennedy]] meets college student [[Claire Redfield]], who is looking for her brother [[Chris Redfield]].\n\nAfter being separated following a car accident, Leon and Claire agree to meet up at the city's police department. The building is infested by zombies, and other monsters, including the \"[[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]]\",{{efn|Officially known as T-00, but commonly referred to as \"Mr. X\".}} who is dispatched to hunt down and kill any survivors. The creatures and various obstacles prevent Leon and Claire from actually reuniting as they are forced to find a way to escape the city.\n\n=== Claire scenario ===\nClaire encounters a young girl, Sherry Birkin, who is being pursued by a monstrous creature. The two manage to escape into the police station parking garage, where corrupt Police Chief Brian Irons abducts Sherry, and locks her in an abandoned orphanage. Claire soon receives a call from Irons to trade Sherry for a pendant she had dropped during the abduction, threatening to kill the little girl if Claire does not comply. Reluctantly, Claire agrees to do so.\n\nSherry tries to escape on her own, but is soon cornered by Irons. Before Irons can harm her, the creature that had been chasing Sherry returns and implants Irons with a parasite. Claire arrives to save Sherry, and the parasite bursts out of Irons' chest, killing him. As Claire and Sherry attempt to leave, the Tyrant arrives and chases the pair into an elevator, but is killed by the creature stalking Sherry. The creature then tries to attack Claire and Sherry, but accidentally causes the elevator to fall into the sewers. The resulting impact knocks Claire unconscious, and Sherry is forced to abandon her to escape.\n\nClaire is found by Annette, Sherry's mother. Annette reveals that the creature after Sherry is William, her husband. The Birkins developed the G-Virus for Umbrella; however, William planned to sell it to the U.S. military. Umbrella sent its paramilitary force to confiscate his work, leading to William being fatally shot. To avoid death and vowing revenge, William had injected himself with the G-Virus. The infected William hunted down the Umbrella soldiers in the sewers. During the carnage he shattered vials of the T-virus the troops had taken, infecting sewer rats and indirectly causing the Raccoon City outbreak. Now a mindless mutating beast, the G-Virus drives William to infect Sherry, as she is the closest genetic match to William and thus the most suitable host to spread the infection.\n\nClaire finds Sherry trapped in a trash compactor by Annette. Upon reaching her, however, Sherry falls ill. Annette realizes William has already infected Sherry and has Claire bring her to an Umbrella lab called NEST, where a vaccine is stored. Once there, Claire uses Sherry's pendant to unlock the vaccine, but William attacks. Claire sends Annette to administer the vaccine while she fights William. After seemingly killing him, Claire reunites with Annette, who has managed to cure Sherry before dying from internal injuries. Sherry tearfully bids her mother goodbye. As the facility enacts a self-destruct protocol, Claire and Sherry make their way to an evacuation train. William returns yet again, and Claire defeats him just as the train prepares to leave. Upon boarding, Claire discovers Leon there as well.\n\n=== Leon scenario ===\nLeon is saved from an infected dog by FBI agent, [[Ada Wong]]. They find reporter Ben Bertolucci in the holding cells; imprisoned by Irons for investigating Umbrella. As Ben tries to convince Leon to release him, the Tyrant kills Ben. While attempting to escape the police station, Leon is intercepted by the Tyrant but is again saved by Ada. Leon pledges to help Ada retrieve a G-Virus sample to prove Umbrella's corruption.\n\nIn the sewers, Annette Birkin ambushes the pair and shoots at Ada; Leon takes the bullet and passes out. Ada pursues Annette but is knocked into a trash compactor. Leon rescues her, and they descend to NEST via cable car, where Ada kisses Leon.\n\nAda, injured, requests that Leon obtain the G sample. In Birkin's lab, Leon obtains a sample but is attacked by William. Annette tries to kill him, but is mortally wounded. Leon defeats William and tends to Annette, who claims that Ada is a mercenary and will sell the virus to the highest bidder.\n\nLeon confronts Ada as the lab's self-destruct protocol begins, where she admits to being a mercenary. Ada demands the G-Virus sample from Leon at gunpoint, but Annette shoots Ada before succumbing to her injuries. As Ada falls off the bridge; Leon catches her, letting the virus sample fall into the abyss. Leon loses his grip and Ada falls.\n\nAs Leon attempts to escape the lab, he is ambushed by the Tyrant, now transformed into the larger and more powerful Super Tyrant and engages it in a final battle. Ada, having survived the fall, tosses a rocket launcher to him, which Leon uses to finally destroy the Super Tyrant. Leon boards the evacuation train, discovering Claire and Sherry already aboard.\n\n=== Ending ===\nAfter Leon, Claire, and Sherry reunite, William attacks the train, having mutated into a gigantic putrid mass of fangs and flesh. Claire and Leon are almost killed in the fight, but manage to uncouple the carriage occupied by William.

A [[Video game remake|remake]] of the 1998 game [[Resident Evil 2|''Resident Evil 2'']], it was released for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on January 25, 2019. Players control rookie police officer [[Leon S. Kennedy]] and student [[Claire Redfield]] as they attempt to escape Raccoon City during a [[zombie apocalypse]].  \n\nCapcom considered remaking ''Resident Evil 2'' following the successful release of [[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|the remake of the first ''Resident Evil'']] in 2002. It was delayed as series creator [[Shinji Mikami]] did not want to divert development from ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005). Capcom announced the ''Resident Evil 2'' remake in August 2015, and released the first trailer and gameplay footage at [[E3 2018]].\n\n''Resident Evil 2'' received acclaim, with praise for its presentation, gameplay, and faithfulness to the original. It was nominated for several awards, including numerous [[game of the year|\"game of the year]]\" awards. By December 2019, it had sold over 5.8 million copies, outselling the original.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Resident Evil 2 Remake gameplay.png|left|thumb|[[Claire Redfield]] is one of the game's two main playable characters.]]\n''Resident Evil 2'' is a remake of the 1998 game [[Resident Evil 2|of the same name]]. Unlike the original, which uses [[tank controls]] and fixed camera angles, the re-imagining features \"over-the-shoulder\" [[third-person shooter]] gameplay similar to ''[[Resident Evil&nbsp;4]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-resident-evil-2-remake-is-familiar-but-ter/1100-6459801/|title=E3 2018: Resident Evil 2 Remake Is Familiar But Terrifying In New Ways|last=Espineli|first=Matt|date=June 12, 2018|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=June 13, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613084807/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-resident-evil-2-remake-is-familiar-but-ter/1100-6459801/|archive-date=June 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, the standard difficulty mode allows players to save as often as they would like inside safe rooms. If the player chooses to play on \"Hardcore\" difficulty, players will be required to collect and use a finite number of ink ribbons to save the game's progress, much like in the original game.\n\nAs with the original game, the remake of ''Resident Evil 2'' offers the option to play through the main campaign with one of two protagonists, the rookie cop [[Leon S. Kennedy]] or the college student [[Claire Redfield]]. Depending on the player's choice, the main story will be experienced with variations in subplots, accessible areas, and obtainable items.\n\nSimilar to the \"Scenario B\" feature of the original game, beating the main campaign for the first time unlocks the option to play through a \"2nd Run\" as the other protagonist. 2nd Run is a variation of the main campaign that adds additional content to frame the second playthrough as occurring concurrently with the first playthrough. For example, the protagonist in 2nd Run will enter the police station from a different entrance and find several doors already unlocked by the protagonist from the first playthrough. Completing 2nd Run is also required to experience the true ending of the main campaign.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Long plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe game is set in Raccoon City in September 1998, two months after the events of ''[[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|Resident Evil]]''. Most of the citizens have been turned into mindless creatures, referred to by survivors as zombies, due to an outbreak of a viral [[bioweapon]] known as the [[T-Virus]], manufactured by [[Umbrella Corporation]].<ref name=\"characters\">{{cite book|title=Resident Evil Archives|date=November 9, 2005|publisher=[[BradyGames Publishing]]|isbn=0-7440-0655-4|pages=117\u2013121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Resident Evil Archives|date=November 9, 2005|publisher=[[BradyGames Publishing]]|isbn=0-7440-0655-4|page=253}}</ref> The game begins at a [[gas station]] outside of the city, where rookie police officer [[Leon S. Kennedy]] meets college student [[Claire Redfield]], who is looking for her brother [[Chris Redfield]].\n\nAfter being separated following a car accident, Leon and Claire agree to meet up at the city's police department. The building is infested by zombies, and other monsters, including the \"[[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]]\",{{efn|Officially known as T-00, but commonly referred to as \"Mr. X\".}} who is dispatched to hunt down and kill any survivors. The creatures and various obstacles prevent Leon and Claire from actually reuniting as they are forced to find a way to escape the city.\n\n=== Claire scenario ===\nClaire encounters a young girl, Sherry Birkin, who is being pursued by a monstrous creature. The two manage to escape into the police station parking garage, where corrupt Police Chief Brian Irons abducts Sherry, and locks her in an abandoned orphanage. Claire soon receives a call from Irons to trade Sherry for a pendant she had dropped during the abduction, threatening to kill the little girl if Claire does not comply. Reluctantly, Claire agrees to do so.\n\nSherry tries to escape on her own, but is soon cornered by Irons. Before Irons can harm her, the creature that had been chasing Sherry returns and implants Irons with a parasite. Claire arrives to save Sherry, and the parasite bursts out of Irons' chest, killing him. As Claire and Sherry attempt to leave, the Tyrant arrives and chases the pair into an elevator, but is killed by the creature stalking Sherry. The creature then tries to attack Claire and Sherry, but accidentally causes the elevator to fall into the sewers. The resulting impact knocks Claire unconscious, and Sherry is forced to abandon her to escape.\n\nClaire is found by Annette, Sherry's mother. Annette reveals that the creature after Sherry is William, her husband. The Birkins developed the G-Virus for Umbrella; however, William planned to sell it to the U.S. military. Umbrella sent its paramilitary force to confiscate his work, leading to William being fatally shot. To avoid death and vowing revenge, William had injected himself with the G-Virus. The infected William hunted down the Umbrella soldiers in the sewers. During the carnage he shattered vials of the T-virus the troops had taken, infecting sewer rats and indirectly causing the Raccoon City outbreak. Now a mindless mutating beast, the G-Virus drives William to infect Sherry, as she is the closest genetic match to William and thus the most suitable host to spread the infection.\n\nClaire finds Sherry trapped in a trash compactor by Annette. Upon reaching her, however, Sherry falls ill. Annette realizes William has already infected Sherry and has Claire bring her to an Umbrella lab called NEST, where a vaccine is stored. Once there, Claire uses Sherry's pendant to unlock the vaccine, but William attacks. Claire sends Annette to administer the vaccine while she fights William. After seemingly killing him, Claire reunites with Annette, who has managed to cure Sherry before dying from internal injuries. Sherry tearfully bids her mother goodbye. As the facility enacts a self-destruct protocol, Claire and Sherry make their way to an evacuation train. William returns yet again, and Claire defeats him just as the train prepares to leave. Upon boarding, Claire discovers Leon there as well.\n\n=== Leon scenario ===\nLeon is saved from an infected dog by FBI agent, [[Ada Wong]]. They find reporter Ben Bertolucci in the holding cells; imprisoned by Irons for investigating Umbrella. As Ben tries to convince Leon to release him, the Tyrant kills Ben. While attempting to escape the police station, Leon is intercepted by the Tyrant but is again saved by Ada. Leon pledges to help Ada retrieve a G-Virus sample to prove Umbrella's corruption.\n\nIn the sewers, Annette Birkin ambushes the pair and shoots at Ada; Leon takes the bullet and passes out. Ada pursues Annette but is knocked into a trash compactor. Leon rescues her, and they descend to NEST via cable car, where Ada kisses Leon.\n\nAda, injured, requests that Leon obtain the G sample. In Birkin's lab, Leon obtains a sample but is attacked by William. Annette tries to kill him, but is mortally wounded. Leon defeats William and tends to Annette, who claims that Ada is a mercenary and will sell the virus to the highest bidder.\n\nLeon confronts Ada as the lab's self-destruct protocol begins, where she admits to being a mercenary. Ada demands the G-Virus sample from Leon at gunpoint, but Annette shoots Ada before succumbing to her injuries. As Ada falls off the bridge; Leon catches her, letting the virus sample fall into the abyss. Leon loses his grip and Ada falls.\n\nAs Leon attempts to escape the lab, he is ambushed by the Tyrant, now transformed into the larger and more powerful Super Tyrant and engages it in a final battle. Ada, having survived the fall, tosses a rocket launcher to him, which Leon uses to finally destroy the Super Tyrant. Leon boards the evacuation train, discovering Claire and Sherry already aboard.\n\n=== Ending ===\nAfter Leon, Claire, and Sherry reunite, William attacks the train, having mutated into a gigantic putrid mass of fangs and flesh. Claire and Leon are almost killed in the fight, but manage to uncouple the carriage occupied by William. The carriage falls behind and is consumed by the exploding lab, destroying William once and for all. As the three survivors finally escape Raccoon City, they vow to continue the fight against Umbrella.\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Resident Evil 2 police car at E3 2018.jpg|thumb|Promotional booth at [[E3 2018]]]]\nThe original ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' was released for the PlayStation in 1998.
