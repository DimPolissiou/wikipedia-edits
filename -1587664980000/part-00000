(i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the rectum and does not extend into the anal canal. The intussuscipiens includes rectal lumen distal to the intussusceptum only).

In full thickness rectal prolapse, these folds run circumferential.  In mucosal prolapse, these folds are radially.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> The folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids. Furthermore, in rectal prolapse, there is a sulcus present between the prolapsed bowel and the anal verge, whereas in hemorrhoidal disease there is no sulcus.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Prolapsed, incarcerated hemorrhoids are extremely painful, whereas as long as a rectal prolapse is not strangulated, it gives little pain and is easy to reduce.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nThe prolapse may be obvious, or it may require straining and squatting to produce it.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> The anus is usually patulous, (loose, open) and has reduced resting and squeeze pressures.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Sometimes it is necessary to observe the patient while they strain on a toilet to see the prolapse happen<ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /> (the perineum can be seen with a mirror or by placing an endoscope in the bowl of the toilet).<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> A phosphate enema may need to be used to induce straining.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\nThe perianal skin may be macerated (softening and whitening of skin that is kept constantly wet) and show [[excoriation]].<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" />\n\n===Proctoscopy/sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy===\nThese may reveal congestion and [[edema]] (swelling) of the distal rectal mucosa,<ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /> and in 10-15% of cases there may be a solitary rectal ulcer on the anterior rectal wall.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Localized inflammation or ulceration can be biopsied, and may lead to a diagnosis of SRUS or colitis cystica profunda.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Rarely, a [[neoplasia|neoplasm]] (tumour) may form on the leading edge of the intussusceptum. In addition, patients are frequently elderly and therefore have increased incidence of [[colorectal cancer]]. Full length colonoscopy is usually carried out in adults prior to any surgical intervention.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> These investigations may be used with contrast media ([[barium enema]]) which may show the associated mucosal abnormalities.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" />\n\n===Videodefecography===\nThis investigation is used to diagnose internal intussusception, or demonstrate a suspected external prolapse that could not be produced during the examination.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> It is usually not necessary with obvious external rectal prolapse.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> [[Defecography]] may demonstrate associated conditions like [[cystocele]], vaginal vault prolapse or [[enterocele]].<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\n===Colonic transit studies===\n[[Colonic transit studies]] may be used to rule out [[colonic inertia]] if there is a history of severe constipation.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /><ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Continent prolapse patients with slow transit constipation, and who are fit for surgery may benefit from subtotal colectomy with rectopexy.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\n===Anorectal manometry===\nThis investigation objectively documents the functional status of the sphincters.

Some authors suggest that [[pudendal nerve]] damage is the cause for pelvic floor and anal sphincter weakening, and may be the underlying cause of a spectrum of pelvic floor disorders.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nSphincter function in rectal prolapse is almost always reduced.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> This may be the result of direct sphincter injury by chronic stretching of the prolapsing rectum. Alternatively, the intussuscepting rectum may lead to chronic stimulation of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR - contraction of the external anal sphincter in response to stool in the rectum). The RAIR was shown to be absent or blunted. Squeeze (maximum voluntary contraction) pressures may be affected as well as the resting tone. This is most likely a denervation injury to the external anal sphincter.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\nThe assumed mechanism of [[fecal incontinence]] in rectal prolapse is by the chronic stretch and trauma to the anal sphincters and the presence of a direct conduit (the intussusceptum) connecting rectum to the external environment which is not guarded by the sphincters.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nThe assumed mechanism of obstructed defecation is by disruption to the rectum and anal canal's ability to contract and fully evacuate rectal contents. The intussusceptum itself may mechanically obstruct the rectoanal [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], creating a blockage that straining, anismus and colonic dysmotility exacerbate.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nSome believe that internal rectal intussusception represents the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse.

Dietary adjustments, including increasing dietary fiber may be beneficial to reduce constipation, and thereby reduce straining.<ref name=Samson2015 /> A bulk forming agent (e.g. [[psyllium]]) or stool softener can also reduce constipation.<ref name=Samson2015 />\n\n====Surgical====\nSurgery is often required to prevent further damage to the anal sphincters. The goals of surgery are to restore the normal anatomy and to minimize symptoms. There is no globally agreed consensus as to which procedures are more effective,<ref name=Samson2015 /> and there have been over 50 different operations described.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nSurgical approaches in rectal prolapse can be either perineal or abdominal. A perineal approach (or trans-perineal) refers to surgical access to the rectum and sigmoid colon via incision around the anus and [[perineum]] (the area between the genitals and the anus).<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Surgery\">{{cite web|last=Sherk|first=Stephanie Dionne|title=Rectal prolapse repair on Encyclopedia of Surgery|url=http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Pa-St/Rectal-Prolapse-Repair.html#b|publisher=Encyclopedia of Surgery|accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref> Abdominal approach (trans-abdominal approach) involves the surgeon cutting into the [[abdomen]] and gaining surgical access to the [[pelvic cavity]]. Procedures for rectal prolapse may involve fixation of the bowel (rectopexy), or resection (a portion removed), or both.<ref name=Samson2015 /> Trans-anal (endo-anal) procedures are also described where access to the internal rectum is gained through the anus itself.\n\n=====Abdominal procedures=====\nThe abdominal approach carries a small risk of impotence in males (e.g. 1-2% in abdominal rectopexy).<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Abdominal operations may be open or [[laparoscopic surgery|laparoscopic]] (keyhole surgery).<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\n'''Laparoscopic procedures'''\nRecovery time following laparoscopic surgery is shorter and less painful than following traditional abdominal surgery.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Surgery\" /> Instead of opening the pelvic cavity with a wide incision (laparotomy), a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) and surgical instruments are inserted into the pelvic cavity via small incisions.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Surgery\" /> Rectopexy and anterior resection have been performed laparoscopically with good results.\n\n=====Perineal procedures=====\nThe perineal approach generally results in less post-operative pain and complications, and a reduced length of hospital stay. These procedures generally carry a higher recurrence rate and poorer functional outcome.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> The perineal procedures include perineal rectosigmoidectomy and Delorme repair.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Elderly, or other medically high-risk patients are usually treated by perineal procedures,<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />  as they can be performed under a [[regional anesthesia|regional anesthetic]], or even [[local anesthetic]] with [[intravenous sedation]], thus avoid the risks of a [[general anesthetic]].<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Alternatively, perineal procedures may be selected to reduce risk of nerve damage, for example in young male patients for whom sexual dysfunction may be a major concern.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\n'''Perineal rectosigmoidectomy'''\n\nThe goal of Perineal rectosigmoidectomy is to resect, or remove, the redundant bowel. This is done through the perineum. The lower rectum is anchored to the sacrum through fibrosis in order to prevent future prolapse.<ref name=Samson2015 /> The full thickness of the rectal wall is incised at a level just above the dentate line. Redundant rectal and sigmoid wall is removed and the new edge of colon is reconnected (anastomosed) with the anal canal with stitches or staples.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> This procedure may be combined with levatorplasty, to tighten the pelvic muscles.<ref name=Samson2015 /> A combined a perineal proctosigmoidectomy with anterior levatoroplasty is also called an Altemeier procedure.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Levatorplasty is performed to correct elvator diastasis which is commonly associated with rectal prolapse.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Perineal rectosigmoidectomy was first introduced by Mikulicz in 1899, and it remained the preferred treatment in Europe for many years.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> It was Popularized by Altemeier.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> The procedure is simple, safe and effective.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Continence Levatorplasty may enhance restoration of continence (2/3 of patients).<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Complications occur in less than 10% of cases, and include pelvic bleeding, pelvic abscess and anastomotic dehiscence (splitting apart of the stitches inside), bleeding or leak at a dehiscence<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Mortality is low.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Recurrence rates are higher than for abdominal repair,<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> 16-30%, but more recent studies give lower recurrence rates.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Additional levatoroplasty  can reduce recurrence rates to 7%.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\n'''Delorme Procedure'''\n\nThis is a modification of the perineal rectosigmoidectomy, differing in that only the mucosa and submucosa are excised from the prolapsed segment, rather than full thickness resection.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> The prolapse is exposed if it is not already present, and the mucosal and submucosal layers are stripped from the redundant length of bowel. The muscle layer that is left is plicated (folded) and placed as a buttress above the pelvic floor.<ref name=Samson2015 /> The edges of the mucosal are then stitched back together. \"Mucosal proctectomy\" was first discussed by Delorme in 1900,<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> now it is becoming more popular again as it has low morbidity and avoids an abdominal incision, while effectively repairing the prolapse.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> The procedure is ideally suited to those patients with full-thickness prolapse limited to partial circumference (e.g., anterior wall) or less-extensive prolapse (perineal rectosigmoidectomy may be difficult in this situation).<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /><ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Fecal incontinence is improved following surgery (40%\u201375% of patients).<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /><ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Post operatively, both mean resting and squeeze pressures were increased.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Constipation is improved in 50% of cases,<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> but often urgency and tenesmus are created. Complications, including infection, urinary retention, bleeding, [[anastomosis|anastomotic]] dehiscence (opening of the stitched edges inside), stricture (narrowing of the gut lumen), diarrhea, and fecal impaction occur in 6-32% of cases.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /><ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Mortality occurs in 0\u20132.5% cases.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> There is a higher recurrence rate than abdominal approaches (7-26% cases).<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /><ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" />\n\n'''Anal encirclement (Thirsch procedure)'''\n\nThis procedure can be carried out under [[local anaesthetic]]. After reduction of the prolapse, a subcutaneous suture (a stich under the skin) or other material is placed encircling the anus, which is then made taut to prevent further prolapse.<ref name=Samson2015 /> Placing silver wire around the anus first described by Thiersch in 1891.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> Materials used include nylon, silk, silastic rods, silicone, Marlex mesh, Mersilene mesh, fascia, tendon, and Dacron.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> This operation does not correct the prolapse itself, it merely supplements the anal sphincter, narrowing the anal canal with the aim of preventing the prolapse from becoming external, meaning it remains in the rectum.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> This goal is achieved in 54-100% cases. Complications include breakage of the encirclement material, fecal impaction, sepsis, and erosion into the skin or anal canal. Recurrence rates are higher that the other perineal procedures. This procedure is most often used for people who have a severe condition or who have a high risk of adverse effects from general anesthetic,<ref name=Samson2015 /> and who may not tolerate other perineal procedures.\n\n==Internal rectal intussusception==\n\n'''Internal rectal intussusception''' (rectal intussusception, internal intussusception, internal rectal prolapse, occult rectal prolapse, internal rectal [[procidentia]] and rectal invagination) is a medical condition defined as a funnel shaped infolding of the [[rectal]] wall that can occur during [[defecation]].<ref name=\"Coloproctology\"/>\n\nThis phenomenon was first described in the late 1960s when [[defecating proctogram|defecography]] was first developed and became widespread.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Degrees of internal intussusception have been demonstrated in 40% of asymptomatic subjects, raising the possibility that it represents a normal variant in some, and may predispose patients to develop symptoms, or exacerbate other problems.<ref name=\"Shorvon 1989\"/>\n\n===Symptoms===\n\nInternal intussusception may be [[asymptomatic]], but common symptoms include:<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\n* [[Fecal leakage]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Portier|first1=G|author2=Kirzin, S; Cabarrot, P; Queralto, M; Lazorthes, F|title=The effect of abdominal ventral rectopexy on faecal incontinence and constipation in patients with internal intra-anal rectal intussusception.|journal=Colorectal Disease|date=August 2011|volume=13|issue=8|pages=914\u20137|pmid=20497199|doi=10.1111/j.1463-1318.2010.02327.x}}</ref>\n* sensation of [[obstructed defecation]] ([[Rectal tenesmus|tenesmus]]).<ref name=\"Johansson 1985\">{{cite journal|last1=Johansson|first1=C|author2=Ihre, T; Ahlb\u00e4ck, SO|title=Disturbances in the defecation mechanism with special reference to intussusception of the rectum (internal procidentia).|journal=Diseases of the Colon and Rectum|date=December 1985|volume=28|issue=12|pages=920\u20134|pmid=4064851|doi=10.1007/bf02554307}}</ref>\n* Pelvic pain.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n* [[Rectal bleeding]].<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\n'''Recto-rectal''' intussusceptions may be [[asymptomatic]], apart from mild obstructed defecation. \"interrupted defaecation\" in the morning is thought by some to be characteristic.<ref name=\"Obstructed defecation web\" />\n\n'''Recto-anal''' intussusceptions commonly give more severe symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, need for digital evacuation of stool, need for support of the [[perineum]] during defecation, urgency, frequency or intermittent [[fecal incontinence]].<ref name=\"Obstructed defecation web\" />\n\nIt has been observed that intussusceptions of thickness \u22653&nbsp;mm, and those that appear to cause obstruction to rectal evacuation may give clinical symptoms.<ref name=weiss>{{cite journal|last1=Weiss|first1=EG|author2=McLemore, EC|title=Functional disorders: rectoanal intussusception.|journal=Clinics in Colon and Rectal Surgery|date=May 2008|volume=21|issue=2|pages=122\u20138|pmid=20011408|doi=10.1055/s-2008-1075861|pmc=2780198}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dvorkin|first1=LS|author2=Gladman, MA; Epstein, J; Scott, SM; Williams, NS; Lunniss, PJ|title=Rectal intussusception in symptomatic patients is different from that in asymptomatic volunteers.|journal=The British Journal of Surgery|date=July 2005|volume=92|issue=7|pages=866\u201372|pmid=15898121|doi=10.1002/bjs.4912}}</ref>\n\n===Cause===\n\nThere are two schools of thought regarding the nature of internal intussusception, viz: whether it is a primary phenomenon, or secondary to (a consequence of) another condition.\n\nSome believe that it represents the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse.

A rectal prolapse is a serious medical condition that requires the attention of a medical professional. However, in rosebud pornography it is performed deliberately. Michelle Lhooq, writing for VICE, argues that rosebudding is an example of producers making 'extreme' content due to the easy availability of free pornography on the internet.

Normal anatomy: (r) rectum, (a) anal canal <br> B. Recto-rectal intussusception <br> C. Recto-anal intussusception]]\nThe most widely used classification of internal rectal prolapse is according to the height on the rectal/sigmoid wall from which they originate and by whether the intussusceptum remains within the rectum or extends into the [[anal canal]]. The height of intussusception from the anal canal is usually estimated by [[defecography]].<ref name=\"Obstructed defecation web\" />\n\n'''Recto-rectal (high) intussusception''' (intra-rectal intussusception) is where the intussusception starts in the rectum, does not protrude into the anal canal, but stays within the rectum. (i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the rectum and does not extend into the anal canal. The intussuscipiens includes rectal lumen distal to the intussusceptum only). These are usually intussusceptions that originate in the upper rectum or lower [[sigmoid colon|sigmoid]].<ref name=\"Obstructed defecation web\" />\n\n'''Recto-anal (low) intussusception''' (intra-anal intussusception) is where the intussusception starts in the rectum and protrudes into the anal canal (i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the rectum, and the intussuscipiens includes part of the anal canal)\n\nAn Anatomico-Functional Classification of internal rectal intussusception has been described,<ref name=\"Obstructed defecation web\" /> with the argument that other factors apart from the height of intussusception above the anal canal appear to be important to predict symptomology. The parameters of this classification are anatomic descent, diameter of intussuscepted bowel, associated rectal hyposensitivity and associated delayed colonic transit:\n\n* Type 1: Internal recto-rectal intussusception\n**Type 1W Wide lumen\n**Type 1N Narrowed lumen\n*Type 2: Internal recto-anal intussusception\n**Type 2W Wide Lumen\n**Type 2N Narrowed lumen\n**Type 2M Narrowed internal lumen with associated rectal hyposensitivity or early megarectum\n*Type 3: Internal-external recto-anal intussusception\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\n===History===\n\nPatients may have associated gynecological conditions which may require multidisciplinary management.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> History of constipation is important because some of the operations may worsen constipation. Fecal incontinence may also influence the choice of management.\n\n===Physical examination===\nRectal prolapse may be confused easily with prolapsing hemorrhoids.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Mucosal prolapse also differs from prolapsing (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids, where there is a segmental prolapse of the hemorrhoidal tissues at the 3,7 and 11\u2019O clock positions.<ref name=\"Gupta 2006\" /> Mucosal prolapse can be differentiated from a full thickness external rectal prolapse (a complete rectal prolapse) by the orientation of the folds (furrows) in the prolapsed section. In full thickness rectal prolapse, these folds run circumferential.  In mucosal prolapse, these folds are radially.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> The folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids. Furthermore, in rectal prolapse, there is a sulcus present between the prolapsed bowel and the anal verge, whereas in hemorrhoidal disease there is no sulcus.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> Prolapsed, incarcerated hemorrhoids are extremely painful, whereas as long as a rectal prolapse is not strangulated, it gives little pain and is easy to reduce.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nThe prolapse may be obvious, or it may require straining and squatting to produce it.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> The anus is usually patulous, (loose, open) and has reduced resting and squeeze pressures.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Sometimes it is necessary to observe the patient while they strain on a toilet to see the prolapse happen<ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /> (the perineum can be seen with a mirror or by placing an endoscope in the bowl of the toilet).<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> A phosphate enema may need to be used to induce straining.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\nThe perianal skin may be macerated (softening and whitening of skin that is kept constantly wet) and show [[excoriation]].<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" />\n\n===Proctoscopy/sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy===\nThese may reveal congestion and [[edema]] (swelling) of the distal rectal mucosa,<ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /> and in 10-15% of cases there may be a solitary rectal ulcer on the anterior rectal wall.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Localized inflammation or ulceration can be biopsied, and may lead to a diagnosis of SRUS or colitis cystica profunda.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Rarely, a [[neoplasia|neoplasm]] (tumour) may form on the leading edge of the intussusceptum. In addition, patients are frequently elderly and therefore have increased incidence of [[colorectal cancer]]. Full length colonoscopy is usually carried out in adults prior to any surgical intervention.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> These investigations may be used with contrast media ([[barium enema]]) which may show the associated mucosal abnormalities.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" />\n\n===Videodefecography===\nThis investigation is used to diagnose internal intussusception, or demonstrate a suspected external prolapse that could not be produced during the examination.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> It is usually not necessary with obvious external rectal prolapse.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> [[Defecography]] may demonstrate associated conditions like [[cystocele]], vaginal vault prolapse or [[enterocele]].<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\n===Colonic transit studies===\n[[Colonic transit studies]] may be used to rule out [[colonic inertia]] if there is a history of severe constipation.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /><ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Continent prolapse patients with slow transit constipation, and who are fit for surgery may benefit from subtotal colectomy with rectopexy.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\n===Anorectal manometry===\nThis investigation objectively documents the functional status of the sphincters. However, the clinical significance of the findings are disputed by some.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" /> It may be used to assess for pelvic floor dyssenergia,<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> ([[anismus]] is a contraindication for certain surgeries, e.g. STARR), and these patients may benefit from post-operative [[biofeedback]] therapy. Decreased squeeze and resting pressures are usually the findings, and this may predate the development of the prolapse.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> Resting tone is usually preserved in patients with mucosal prolapse.<ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /> In patients with reduced resting pressure, levatorplasty may be combined with prolapse repair to further improve continence.<ref name=\"ASCRS textbook\" />\n\n===Anal electromyography/Pudendal nerve testing===\nMay be used to evaluate incontinence, but there is disagreement about what relevance the results may show, as rarely do they mandate a change of surgical plan.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" /> There may be denervation of striated musculature on the electromyogram.<ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /> Increased nerve conduction periods (nerve damage), this may be significant in predicting post-operative incontinence.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\n==Complete rectal prolapse==\n[[File:Rectal prolaps.jpg|thumbnail|right|A severe example of complete (external) rectal prolapse. Note circumferential arrangement of mucosal folds.]]\n\nRectal prolapse is a \"falling down\" of the rectum so that it is visible externally.

Some authors suggest that [[pudendal nerve]] damage is the cause for pelvic floor and anal sphincter weakening, and may be the underlying cause of a spectrum of pelvic floor disorders.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nSphincter function in rectal prolapse is almost always reduced.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" /> This may be the result of direct sphincter injury by chronic stretching of the prolapsing rectum. Alternatively, the intussuscepting rectum may lead to chronic stimulation of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR - contraction of the external anal sphincter in response to stool in the rectum). The RAIR was shown to be absent or blunted. Squeeze (maximum voluntary contraction) pressures may be affected as well as the resting tone. This is most likely a denervation injury to the external anal sphincter.<ref name=\"ASCRS: Prolapse and Intussusception\" />\n\nThe assumed mechanism of [[fecal incontinence]] in rectal prolapse is by the chronic stretch and trauma to the anal sphincters and the presence of a direct conduit (the intussusceptum) connecting rectum to the external environment which is not guarded by the sphincters.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nThe assumed mechanism of obstructed defecation is by disruption to the rectum and anal canal's ability to contract and fully evacuate rectal contents. The intussusceptum itself may mechanically obstruct the rectoanal [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], creating a blockage that straining, anismus and colonic dysmotility exacerbate.<ref name=\"ASCRS Prolapse, Intussusception, SRUS\" />\n\nSome believe that internal rectal intussusception represents the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse.

This is done through the perineum.

Complications include breakage of the encirclement material, fecal impaction, sepsis, and erosion into the skin or anal canal. Recurrence rates are higher that the other perineal procedures.

This increased pressure causes the anterior portion of the rectal lining to be forced into the anal canal (an [[Rectal prolapse#Internal rectal intussusception|internal rectal intussusception]]). The lining of the rectum is repeatedly damaged by this friction, resulting in [[ulceration]]. SRUS can therefore considered to be a consequence of internal intussusception (a sub type of rectal prolapse), which can be demonstrated in 94% of cases. It may be [[asymptomatic]], but it can cause [[rectal pain]], [[rectal bleeding]], [[rectal malodor]], incomplete evacuation and [[obstructed defecation]] (rectal outlet obstruction).\n\n===Symptoms===\nSymptoms include:<ref name=abid/><ref name=\"Yamada GI textbook\" /><ref name=\"mackle\" />\n* Straining during [[defecation]]\n* Mucous [[rectal discharge]]\n* [[Rectal bleeding]]\n* Sensation of incomplete evacuation ([[Rectal tenesmus|tenesmus]])\n* [[constipation]], or more rarely [[diarrhea]]\n* [[fecal incontinence]] (rarely)\n\n===Prevalence===\nThe condition is thought to be uncommon.

Ulceration is thought to be caused by resulting poor blood supply ([[ischemia]]), combined with repeated frictional trauma from the prolapsing lining, and exposure to increased pressure are thought to cause ulceration. Trauma from hard stools may also contribute.\n\nThe site of the ulcer is typically on the [[anterior]] wall of the [[rectal ampulla]], about 7\u201310&nbsp;cm from the anus. However, the area may of ulceration may be closer to the anus, deeper inside, or on the lateral or posterior rectal walls.

Until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] it was the church of a [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] nunnery. It is now the largest parish church in the county, since [[Christchurch Priory]] is now in Dorset.\n\n==Background==\nThe church was originally built during the 10th century, as part of a [[Benedictine]] foundation. The surviving church is the town's outstanding feature, which is all the more remarkable because the abbey, as a nunnery, would have been less well financially endowed than other religious establishments of the time.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:RomseyAbbey-West.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The west window of Romsey Abbey.]]\nThe religious community continued to grow and a village grew around it to keep it supplied with produce. Both suffered in 993 when [[Viking]] raiders sacked the village and burnt down the original church. However, the abbey was rebuilt in stone in around 1000 and the village quickly recovered. The abbey and its religious community flourished and were renowned as a seat of learning \u2013 especially for the children of the nobility.\n\nIn [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] times a substantial, new stone abbey, primarily designed as a convent, was built  on the old Anglo-Saxon foundation (circa 1130 to 1140 AD) by  [[Henry Blois]], Bishop of Winchester and Abbot of Glastonbury. Bishop Henry was the younger brother of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]] and his structure dominates the town to this day. By 1240 in excess of 100 nuns were living in the community.\n\nThe rule of Elizabeth Broke was filled with scandal. A commission was held against her for many charges including allowing poor dress standards for nuns, allowing nuns to go to the towns taverns, poor account keeping and an unhealthy relationship with the Chaplain.<ref>Rev. Thomas Perkins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_d-caKzecD0C&pg=PT79&lpg=PT79&dq=Abbess+Johanna+Icthe&source=bl&ots=Y-VD5fY-iZ&sig=whY2_PrkUhJbNIR5RMd2FTS1uHI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9jvwU9ykJti58gXF-oH4Cg&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Abbess%20Johanna%20Icthe&f=false   ''Bell's Cathedrals: A Short Account of Romsey Abbey, A Description of the Fabric and Notes on the History of the Convent of Ss. Mary & Ethelfleda''] (Library of Alexandria).</ref>\n\nThe abbey continued to grow and prosper until the [[Black Death]] struck the town in 1348-9. While it is thought that as much as half of the population of the town \u2013 which was then about 1,000 \u2013 died as a result, the number of nuns fell by over 80% to 19. 72 nuns died including Abbess Johanna. After the plague there were never more than 26 nuns in the Abbey.<ref>Rev. Thomas Perkins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_d-caKzecD0C&pg=PT79&lpg=PT79&dq=Abbess+Johanna+Icthe&source=bl&ots=Y-VD5fY-iZ&sig=whY2_PrkUhJbNIR5RMd2FTS1uHI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9jvwU9ykJti58gXF-oH4Cg&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Abbess%20Johanna%20Icthe&f=false   ''Bell's Cathedrals: A Short Account of Romsey Abbey, A Description of the Fabric and Notes on the History of the Convent of Ss. Mary & Ethelfleda''] (Library of Alexandria).</ref>\n\nThis so affected the area that the overall prosperity of the abbey dwindled and it was finally suppressed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1539.\n\n[[File:RomseyAbbeyMountbatten.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Tombs in Romsey Abbey, including that of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten of Burma]].]]\nHowever the abbey did not suffer the fate of many other religious establishments at this time and was not demolished, although the community itself was forcibly dispersed. This was because it had, in modern terms, become \"dual use\" containing a church within a church \u2013 a substantial section being dedicated to [[St Lawrence]] and used solely by the townspeople.\n\nSubsequently, the town purchased the abbey from [[the Crown]] for \u00a3100 in 1544 and then set about demolishing that very section, set aside as the church of St Lawrence, that had ensured its survival in the first place.\n\nThe abbey survives today not least due to the efforts of the Reverend [[Edward Lyon Berthon]] during the 19th century who set about restoring it to some of its former glory. It is now the largest parish church in the county and houses the tomb of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]] and of Sir [[William Petty]] FRS, the great English economist, scientist and philosopher. Mountbatten had been granted the lesser title of Baron Romsey in 1947 on being given his [[Earldom]] and lived locally at [[Broadlands]] House. On 27 August 1979, Mountbatten, his grandson Nicholas, and two others were assassinated by a bomb set by members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], hidden aboard his fishing boat in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, [[Ireland]]. He was buried in the abbey following a full state funeral in Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe current vicar is the Reverend Thomas Wharton, who took up the post in September 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Vicar Appointed |url=https://www.romseyabbey.org.uk/2018/05/new-vicar-appointed/ |website=Romsey Abbey |accessdate=14 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===List of Abbesses===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; border:0; text-align:left; line-height:150%;\"\n|- align=left\n!  style=\"background:#ddddec\"|Name\n!  style=\"background:#ddddec\"|year appointed\n!  style=\"background:#ddddec\"|year resigned/died\n!  style=\"background:#ddddec\"|Notes\n\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbey founded \t\t\n|907\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess\t[[\u00c6lfl\u00e6da of Romsey|\u00c6lfl\u00e6da]]\n|907\n|\n|Daughter of [[Edward the Elder]], Abbey was built for her.\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess [[Merwinna]]\t\n|966\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess [[Elwina]]\t\n|992\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6da of Romsey|\u00c6thelfl\u00e6da]]\n|1003\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Wulfynn\t\t\n|1016\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess [[\u00c6lfgyfu]]\t\n|1042\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Incomplete records for about a century\n|\n|\n| <ref>Abbess [[Cristina, daughter of Edward the Exile|Cristina]] at Romsey flourished 1086AD, until probably before 1093AD when her nieces were moved to Wilton Abbey.</ref><ref>Abbess [[Eadgyth]] at Romsey about 1093AD.</ref>\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbes Hadewisa\t\t\n|1130\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Matildis\t\t\n|1150\t\t\n|1155\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Princess Mary \t\n|1155\t\t\n|1171\n|Daughter of [[King Stephen of England|King Stephen]], left to marry.\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Juliana\t\t\n|1171 \t\t\n|1174\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Matilad Patric\t\n|1218\t\t\n|1219\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess matilda \t\t\n|1218\t\t\n|1230\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Matilasa de Barbfle\n|1230\n|1231\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Isabel de Nevil\t\t\t\n|1237\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Cecilia\t\t\n|1238\t\t\n|1247\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Constancia\t\n|1247\t\t\n|1261\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abess Amicia de Sulhere\t\n|1261\t\t\n|1268\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Alicia Walerand\t\t\t\n|1269\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Phillipa de Stokes\t\n|1296\t\n|1307\n|was very infirm as Abbess.<ref>Rev.

After its demolition in 1625, the set of six bells was transferred to a  wooden  belfry on top of the central tower.  They were replaced by a new set of eight in 1791; the heaviest, the tenor, weighing 26 cwt.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perkins |first1=Thomas|title= A Short Account of Romsey Abbey |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22880   |accessdate=  |series=Bell\u2019s Cathedral Guides |year=1907 |publisher=George Bell & Sons |location=London |page=35 |pages=  }}</ref> Three of the bells were recast in 1932. The bells and their eighteenth  century bell frame were restored in 2007, when removing the crown reduced the weight of the tenor to 22 cwt. The Bells are now known across the region for being one of the finest rings of 8 bells.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Music==\n\n===Choir===\nRomsey Abbey has a traditional choir of boy choristers and a back row of adult altos, tenors and basses drawn from the local area. They also have a choir of girls, a senior girls choir, a training choir of youngsters and a consort of voluntary singers and members of the congregation who sing when the choirs are on holiday. Over the years the choirs have recorded multiple CDs, sung for royalty, enjoyed choir tours to numerous UK Cathedrals, Belgium, Italy and France and have a twinning relationship with a German choir from [[M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr]]. They have appeared numerous times on BBC ''[[Songs of Praise]]'' as well as featuring in a BBC Documentary in 2018. The current director of music is Martin Seymour.\n\n===Organs===\nRomsey Abbey has two organs. The main instrument was built by [[J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd|J W Walker & Sons]] in 1858 and replaced an earlier instrument by Henry Coster.  The Walker Organ was rebuilt in its present position and enlarged in 1888.  Major restoration work was carried out by J W Walker & Sons Ltd in 1995/96 under the supervision of the abbey's organist Jeffrey Williams, restoring the mechanical actions and overhauling all of the pipe work.  1999 saw the construction of a completely new Nave Organ with pipe work located on the South Triforium. This can be played either from a mobile console in the nave or from the main console.<ref>[http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N11434 National Pipe Organ Register]</ref>[[File:The Choir and organ of Romsey Abbey December 2012.jpg|thumb|The Choir and organ of Romsey Abbey December 2012]]\n\n===Organist and master of the choristers===\n*S.T.

Until the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]] it was the church of a [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] nunnery. It is now the largest parish church in the county, since [[Christchurch Priory]] is now in Dorset.\n\n==Background==\nThe church was originally built during the 10th century, as part of a [[Benedictine]] foundation. The surviving church is the town's outstanding feature, which is all the more remarkable because the abbey, as a nunnery, would have been less well financially endowed than other religious establishments of the time.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:RomseyAbbey-West.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The west window of Romsey Abbey.]]\nThe religious community continued to grow and a village grew around it to keep it supplied with produce. Both suffered in 993 when [[Viking]] raiders sacked the village and burnt down the original church. However, the abbey was rebuilt in stone in around 1000 and the village quickly recovered. The abbey and its religious community flourished and were renowned as a seat of learning \u2013 especially for the children of the nobility.\n\nIn [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] times a substantial, new stone abbey, primarily designed as a convent, was built  on the old Anglo-Saxon foundation (circa 1130 to 1140 AD) by  [[Henry Blois]], Bishop of Winchester and Abbot of Glastonbury. Bishop Henry was the younger brother of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]] and his structure dominates the town to this day. By 1240 in excess of 100 nuns were living in the community.\n\nThe rule of Elizabeth Broke was filled with scandal. A commission was held against her for many charges including allowing poor dress standards for nuns, allowing nuns to go to the towns taverns, poor account keeping and an unhealthy relationship with the Chaplain.<ref>Rev. Thomas Perkins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_d-caKzecD0C&pg=PT79&lpg=PT79&dq=Abbess+Johanna+Icthe&source=bl&ots=Y-VD5fY-iZ&sig=whY2_PrkUhJbNIR5RMd2FTS1uHI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9jvwU9ykJti58gXF-oH4Cg&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Abbess%20Johanna%20Icthe&f=false   ''Bell's Cathedrals: A Short Account of Romsey Abbey, A Description of the Fabric and Notes on the History of the Convent of Ss. Mary & Ethelfleda]'' (Library of Alexandria).</ref>\n\nThe abbey continued to grow and prosper until the [[Black Death]] struck the town in 1348-9. While it is thought that as much as half of the population of the town \u2013 which was then about 1,000 \u2013 died as a result, the number of nuns fell by over 80% to 19. 72 nuns died including Abbess Johanna. After the plague there were never more than 26 nuns in the Abbey.<ref>Rev. Thomas Perkins, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_d-caKzecD0C&pg=PT79&lpg=PT79&dq=Abbess+Johanna+Icthe&source=bl&ots=Y-VD5fY-iZ&sig=whY2_PrkUhJbNIR5RMd2FTS1uHI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9jvwU9ykJti58gXF-oH4Cg&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Abbess%20Johanna%20Icthe&f=false   ''Bell's Cathedrals: A Short Account of Romsey Abbey, A Description of the Fabric and Notes on the History of the Convent of Ss. Mary & Ethelfleda]'' (Library of Alexandria).</ref>\n\nThis so affected the area that the overall prosperity of the abbey dwindled and it was finally suppressed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1539.\n\n[[File:RomseyAbbeyMountbatten.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Tombs in Romsey Abbey, including that of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten of Burma]].]]\nHowever the abbey did not suffer the fate of many other religious establishments at this time and was not demolished, although the community itself was forcibly dispersed. This was because it had, in modern terms, become \"dual use\" containing a church within a church \u2013 a substantial section being dedicated to [[St Lawrence]] and used solely by the townspeople.\n\nSubsequently, the town purchased the abbey from [[the Crown]] for \u00a3100 in 1544 and then set about demolishing that very section, set aside as the church of St Lawrence, that had ensured its survival in the first place.\n\nThe abbey survives today not least due to the efforts of the Reverend [[Edward Lyon Berthon]] during the 19th century who set about restoring it to some of its former glory. It is now the largest parish church in the county and houses the tomb of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]] and of Sir [[William Petty]] FRS, the great English economist, scientist and philosopher. Mountbatten had been granted the lesser title of Baron Romsey in 1947 on being given his [[Earldom]] and lived locally at [[Broadlands]] House. On 27 August 1979, Mountbatten, his grandson Nicholas, and two others were assassinated by a bomb set by members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], hidden aboard his fishing boat in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, [[Ireland]]. He was buried in the abbey following a full state funeral in Westminster Abbey.\n\nThe current vicar is the Reverend Thomas Wharton, who took up the post in September 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Vicar Appointed |url=https://www.romseyabbey.org.uk/2018/05/new-vicar-appointed/ |website=Romsey Abbey |accessdate=14 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===List of Abbesses===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; border:0; text-align:left; line-height:150%;\"\n|- align=left\n!  style=\"background:#ddddec\"|Name\n!  style=\"background:#ddddec\"|year appointed\n!  style=\"background:#ddddec\"|year resigned/died\n!  style=\"background:#ddddec\"|Notes\n\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbey founded \t\t\n|907\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess\t[[\u00c6lfl\u00e6da of Romsey|\u00c6lfl\u00e6da]]\n|907\n|\n|Daughter of [[Edward the Elder]], Abbey was built for her.\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess [[Merwinna]]\t\n|966\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess [[Elwina]]\t\n|992\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6da of Romsey|\u00c6thelfl\u00e6da]]\n|1003\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Wulfynn\t\t\n|1016\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess [[\u00c6lfgyfu]]\t\n|1042\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Incomplete records for about a century\n|\n|\n| <ref>Abbess [[Cristina, daughter of Edward the Exile|Cristina]] at Romsey flourished 1086AD, until probably before 1093AD when her nieces were moved to Wilton Abbey.</ref><ref>Abbess [[Eadgyth]] at Romsey about 1093AD.</ref>\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbes Hadewisa\t\t\n|1130\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Matildis\t\t\n|1150\t\t\n|1155\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Princess Mary \t\n|1155\t\t\n|1171\n|Daughter of [[King Stephen of England|King Stephen]], left to marry.\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Juliana\t\t\n|1171 \t\t\n|1174\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Matilad Patric\t\n|1218\t\t\n|1219\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess matilda \t\t\n|1218\t\t\n|1230\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Matilasa de Barbfle\n|1230\n|1231\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Isabel de Nevil\t\t\t\n|1237\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Cecilia\t\t\n|1238\t\t\n|1247\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Constancia\t\n|1247\t\t\n|1261\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abess Amicia de Sulhere\t\n|1261\t\t\n|1268\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Alicia Walerand\t\t\t\n|1269\n|\n|\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#ffffec;\"\n|Abbess Phillipa de Stokes\t\n|1296\t\n|1307\n|was very infirm as Abbess.<ref>Rev.

After its demolition in 1625, the set of six bells was transferred to a  wooden  belfry on top of the central tower.  They were replaced by a new set of eight in 1791; the heaviest, the tenor, weighing 26 cwt.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perkins |first1=Thomas|title= A Short Account of Romsey Abbey |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22880   |accessdate=  |series=Bell\u2019s Cathedral Guides |year=1907 |publisher=George Bell & Sons |location=London |page=35 |pages=  }}</ref> Three of the bells were recast in 1932. The bells and their eighteenth  century bell frame were restored in 2007, when removing the crown reduced the weight of the tenor to 22 cwt. The Bells are now known across the region for being one of the finest rings of 8 bells.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Music==\n\n===Choir===\nRomsey Abbey has a traditional choir of boy choristers and a back row of adult altos, tenors and basses drawn from the local area. They also have a choir of girls, a senior girls choir, a training choir of youngsters and a consort of voluntary singers and members of the congregation who sing when the choirs are on holiday. Over the years the choirs have recorded multiple CDs, sung for royalty, enjoyed choir tours to numerous UK Cathedrals, Belgium, Italy and France and have a twinning relationship with a German choir from [[M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr]]. They have appeared numerous times on BBC ''[[Songs of Praise]]'' as well as featuring in a BBC Documentary in 2018. The current director of music is Martin Seymour.\n\n===Organs===\nRomsey Abbey has two organs. The main instrument was built by [[J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd|J W Walker & Sons]] in 1858 and replaced an earlier instrument by Henry Coster.  The Walker Organ was rebuilt in its present position and enlarged in 1888.  Major restoration work was carried out by J W Walker & Sons Ltd in 1995/96 under the supervision of the abbey's organist Jeffrey Williams, restoring the mechanical actions and overhauling all of the pipe work.  1999 saw the construction of a completely new Nave Organ with pipe work located on the South Triforium. This can be played either from a mobile console in the nave or from the main console.<ref>[http://www.npor.org.uk/cgi-bin/Rsearch.cgi?Fn=Rsearch&rec_index=N11434 National Pipe Organ Register]</ref>[[File:The Choir and organ of Romsey Abbey December 2012.jpg|thumb|The Choir and organ of Romsey Abbey December 2012]]\n\n===Organist and master of the choristers===\n*S.T.
