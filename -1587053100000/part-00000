The Romans conquered and settled the entire area, retaining control until the [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] invasions and [[Migration Period|Slavic migrations]] in the 7th century. The Croats and other Slavic tribes subjugated by the Croats secured most of the Dalmatian seaboard, but [[Dalmatian City-States|some cities and islands]] (like Lagosta) of the [[romanisation (cultural)|romanised]] Dalmatians remained independent under the nominal rule of the Byzantines. In 1000 AD the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] [[Battle of Lastovo (1000)|attacked and destroyed the settlement]] due to the island's participation in piracy along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast. After the Venetian domination, in the 13th century Lagosta joined the [[Republic of Ragusa]] where for several centuries it enjoyed a certain level of autonomy until the republic's conquest by the French, under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]] then ruled the island for the next century, then Italy for 30 years after [[World War I]], and finally Yugoslavia until it became a part of the independent Republic of [[Croatia]].\n\nThe island is noted for its 15th- and 16th-century Venetian architecture. There is a large number of churches of relatively small size, a testament to the island's long-standing [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition. The major cultural event is the [[Lastovo Poklad|Poklade]], or carnival. The island largely relies on its natural environment to attract tourists each season. In 2006 the [[Croatian Government]] made the island and its archipelago a nature park.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.lastovo.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=85&Itemid=64&lang=hr\n| title=Lastovsko oto\u010dje \u2013 11. hrvatski park prirode\n| work=www.lastovo.org\n| publisher=Park prirode Lastovo\n| language=Croatian\n| accessdate=2009-05-12\n}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lastovo and the surrounding islands.jpg|300px|left|thumbnail|Lastovo and surrounding islands]]\n[[File:2014-10-24 06-56-31 Croatia Dubrovacko-Neretvanska Oskoru\u0161no.jpg|left|thumbnail|Aerial view of Lastovo]]\nThe island of Lastovo belongs to the central Dalmatian archipelago.

His source was [[Theopompus]], a 4th-century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian. The names of numerous other Illyric settlements along the coast had the same suffix ''-est'' which indicates its [[Illyrian languages|Illyric]] origins. When the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered Dalmatia they gave the island the Latin name '''Augusta Insula''' meaning \"Emperor's Island\". During the [[Middle Ages]], the name would be transcribed as ''Augusta'', ''Lagusta'' or ''Lagosta''. The Slavic suffix ''[[-ovo]]'' combined with the Roman form of ''Lasta'' gives the islands present name of ''Lastovo''.<ref name=belamaric/>\n\nThe first traces of human presence on the island were found in the Ra\u010da cave where continuous evidence of habitation reaches as far as the late [[Neolithic Age]]. In prehistoric times the island was inhabited by the Illyrians. However finds of Greek ceramics show that the island was on one of the Greek trade routes on the Adriatic and probably a part of the state of [[Vis (island)|Issa]].<ref name=belamaric/>\n\nWhen the Romans conquered the province of Dalmatia they too settled Lastovo. The Romans named the island '''Augusta Insula'''. The Romans left traces of their long rule on the island, in the form of the so-called ''[[villa rustica]]'' estates (residential farming units) and the water catchment areas known as the ''lokve''. The Romans established a settlement on location of today's village of [[Ubli, Lastovo|Ubli]] that flourished during first centuries AD, only to become completely abandoned in later centuries after being destroyed by the barbarians.<ref name=belamaric/>\n\n===Middle Ages===\nWith the arrival of the [[Croats]] to Adriatic in the 7th century, Croats eventually settled most of Dalmatia which included Lastovo. Around 950, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos]] mentions Lastovo in his ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' by its [[Croatian language|Croatian]] name ''Lastobon''.<ref name=dai>{{cite book\n| last = [[Constantine VII]]\n| year = c. 950\n| title = [[De Administrando Imperio]]\n}}</ref> In 998 the [[Venetian Doge]] [[Pietro Orseolo II]] launched large military operations against Croatian and Neretvian pirates along the Adriatic and its islands, which culminated in 1000 with the [[Battle of Lastovo (1000)|destruction of the town of Lastovo]]. After that the residents (''Lastovci'' or ''Lastov\u010dani'') decided to build a city on the internal hill away from the coast which made the city more defendable. During the next two centuries, inhabitants dedicated themselves more to agriculture and neglected their earlier naval tradition.<ref name=jurica/> Scarcity of accurate historical documents and an almost complete silence covering the events on the island in the early Middle Ages are trustworthy signs of a great autonomy of Lastovo in that period. Lastovo may have at times come briefly under various rulers from the 7th to 13th centuries, whether [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Duklja]]n or [[Narentine]], however, it is accepted that Lastovo generally recognised the [[Kings of Croatia|Croatian kings]] as its nominal and natural rulers.<ref name=belamaric/><ref name=jurica/> In 1185 the [[Hvar diocese]] is formed of which Lastovo is mentioned as having been part. A church synod held in Split that same year decreed that the [[diocese of Hvar]] should fall under the authority of the [[Archbishop of Split]].\n\n===Republic of Ragusa===\n[[File:Pecat.gif|thumb|left|Lastovo commune's official seal known as the Pe\u010dat within the Republic of Ragusa]]\nLater in the 13th century the people of Lastovo voluntarily joined the [[Republic of Ragusa]]  in 1252 after the republic promised that it would honour Lastovo's internal autonomy.

Continuous limitation of the island's autonomy and higher taxes led to a short lived rebellion in 1602. On the appeal of islanders, [[Venice]] occupied the island the following year and held it until 1606, when it was returned to Ragusa. The next attempt at rebellion was in 1652, which resulted in the loss of the island's autonomy.<ref name=jurica/>\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquests, Lastovo was very often a target of [[pirate]]s from [[Ulcinj]], leading to the introduction of mandatory guard service. Guard service was abolished in the 18th century when pirates from Ulcinj became merchant sailors. The last reported outbreak of ''[[vampirism]]'' in Croatia was 'recorded' on Lastovo. The trial in Ragusa in 1737 took testimony from visitors to the island during an outbreak of ''severe diarrhoea'' which killed many locals. The islanders blamed this epidemic on vampires. This case included from Lastovo the defendants who formed a band or group of vigilante style vampire hunters. Such cases were reported throughout all of Croatia and indeed Europe in the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"liepopili\">Liepopili, Ante (1918). \"Vukodlaci\" (in Croatian).

When they abolished the Republic in 1808, Lastovo became part of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and was included in the Napoleonic \"Kingdom of Italy\". The French built a fortification on Glavica hill and mobilised islanders against the British. Between 18 January and 3 February 1813, the [[Royal Navy]] [[sailing frigate|frigate]] [[HMS Apollo (1805)|HMS ''Apollo'']] and troops captured Lastovo and [[Kor\u010dula]]. The British held the island until 1815 when the [[Congress of Vienna]] awarded the island to the [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg Empire]]. After 1815, Lastovo was part of Dubrovnik county in the Austrian province of [[Dalmatia]]. Until 1829, it had its own court, but later the island fell under the jurisdiction of the court in [[Kor\u010dula]]. In the 1840s, the municipality fell into a deep economic crisis that resulted in its selling most of its forests to foreigners.<ref name=jurica/>\n\n[[File:Lagosta 1900 Lastovo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Austrian KK tax stamp cancelled in 1900, with both ''Croatian'' and ''Italian'' names]]\n\n===20th century===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2009}}\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] established a military garrison on Glavica consisting mostly of Hungarian troops. The authorities ordered blackouts and forbade the ringing of church bells during the war. At the end of 1917 four French planes  bombed Lastovo. Some French troops landed on the island to reconnoiter it. Italian forces soon followed and clashed with the garrison. Some members of the Austro-Hungarian garrison escaped. The Italians took those they caught to Italy as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. A French plane dropping leaflets on the island on 4 November brought the news that the war was finally over. On 11 November 1918 Italian troops took possession of the island based on the [[Treaty of London (1915)|1915 Secret Treaty of London]], which allocated much of Dalmatia to Italy upon Italy entering the war on the side of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. The Italians based their claim upon the presence of ethnic Italians in all parts of maritime Dalmatia. However, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who was a supporter of the nationality principle, blocked the allocation.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n[[File:Lastovo Ort.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Town of Lastovo]]\nAs a consequence, under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo agreement]] of 1920, Italy received in Dalmatia only Zara (today [[Zadar]]), due to its Italian majority, and Lagosta. Although the Italian population was in the minority, it was smaller than other Dalmatian places such as [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (Lissa){{Clarify|date=September 2012}}. After the advent of Fascism in Italy (1922), the Italians followed a policy of [[Italianization]] in all its possessions. At the same time, living standards improved. Many public works were started, and the island reached its peak population of approximately 2,000. This growth resulted in part from the immigration from other Dalmatian towns, of ethnic Italians who wished to live under Italian rule.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn 1941 the [[Axis Powers]] attacked Yugoslavia, which collapsed in few days.  Italy annexed part of Dalmatia; the remainder became part of the new [[Independent State of Croatia]]. On September 8, 1943, after the declaration of the [[Armistice with Italy]], the Italian Army collapsed and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] took over the island, incorporating it into [[Yugoslavia]]. Lastovo became a part of the [[History of Croatia|People's Republic of Croatia]] in 1945\u2014one of the six Republics of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and into the [[History of Croatia|Socialist Republic of Croatia]] \u2014 one of the republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1953.<ref name=jurica/> At this time all the Italian residents left the island.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Lastovo experienced the same fate as the neighbouring island [[Vis (island)|Vis]].  The island became a military region barred to foreign nationals.  The barring of foreign nationals led to economic stagnation and the depopulation of the island.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1988 the ban was lifted and foreign tourists were again allowed to visit the island.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, but the Yugoslav People's Army only left its bases on Lastovo, one of its last footholds in Croatia, in July 1992. The war in Croatia ended in 1995. Lastovo escaped much of the devastation that swept across some parts of Croatia and most of neighbouring Bosnia.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Demographics==\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%\">\n{| style=\"float:right;\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Population<ref>''Nautical Tourism Development in the Lastovo Islands Nature Park'', p. 6</ref>\n|-\n!

All the island residents participate by wearing folk costumes. The origins of the Lastovo carnival go back to a historical event. Legend has it that [[Catalan people|Catalan]] pirates attacked neighbouring [[Kor\u010dula]] and sent a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] messenger to Lastovo to tell the islanders to surrender or they would be next. The inhabitants of Lastovo did not let themselves be intimidated \u2014 instead they armed themselves and went on the attack. The women and children prayed to Sv. Jure ''([[St. George]])'' for help and their prayers were answered: a storm destroyed the pirates' ships and the inhabitants of Lastovo caught the messenger. In order to mock him, he was taken through the village on the back of a donkey and was afterwards sentenced and burned to death. This event is celebrated through the [[Lastovo Poklad|Poklad]] every year over a period of three days. The event takes place in the middle of February and since the summer 2006 it has become main attraction for tourists.  Locals enjoy this event very much and Lastovci from all around Croatia return to Lastovo to attend the carnival.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.adriatica.net/croatia/feature/lastovo_en.htm\n| title = Lastovo \u2013 Carnival Island\n| accessdate = 6 March 2011\n| publisher = Adriatica.net\n}} Permission was granted by the website to publish the text under the terms of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]].</ref>\n\n=== Churches ===\n[[File:Kuzma.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Lastovo|Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian]]]]\nThe main church is the [[Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Lastovo|Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian]] ({{lang|hr|Crkva sv. Kuzme i Damjana}}). It is situated in the oldest part of the square in the town of Lastovo and dates from the 14th century. On the main altar is the painting of Saint Cosmas and Damian.  Out of the rest of the paintings ''Pieta'', the work of an anonymous Venetian painter from 1545, can be distinguished. On its place there was a smaller church that dates back from 5th or 6th century.  The church of Sv Vlaho (''[[Saint Blaise]]'') from the 12th century is on the entrance of the settlement. Beside it the chapel of Saint John was built in 1607, and around the church a defence wall and a tower.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOn the graveyard on the southern edge is the little church of [[Saint Mary]] in the field from the 14th century and is considered as most attractive on the island. Near the ferry port in Ubli an archaeological find of the remains of a 6th-century church dedicated to Sv Petar ''([[Saint Peter]])'' are situated. Other churches of interest are Sv Luka ''(St Luke)'' built in the typical Croatian 11th-century sacral architecture, and Sv Jurje ''(St George)'' at Pre\u017eba also built in the 11th century, was demolished between the two World Wars. Another church called St Peter in Ubli built somewhere in the 11th\u201313th centuries was demolished by the Italians in 1933 to make way for extra fishing sheds.<ref name=jurica/> All together there are a total of 46 churches, making the number [[46 (number)|46]] omnipresent since the island also has 46 hills, covers {{convert|46|km2|0|abbr=on}}, has 46 fields, and contains 46 islands in the archipelago.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n[[File:fumar.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Fumar]]\nThe town's buildings date mainly from the 15th and 16th centuries when the construction of about 20 [[Renaissance]] houses redefined the village's appearance. Most of them have high broad terraces which have become the ''\"trade mark\"'' look of Lastovo houses. Their unusual cylindrical chimneys that the locals call ''fumari'' are picturesque and unusual since they look like miniature minarets, although there is no record of Arab or Turkish influence ever directly reaching this area. The ornate chimney on the 16th century Biza Antica house is probably the oldest preserved chimney in Dalmatia. The Struga lighthouse built in 1839 on Lastovo's southern tip near [[Skrivena Luka]] is one of the oldest lighthouses in Croatia.<ref name=jurica/>\n\n===Language===\nInhabitants speak the [[Chakavian|\u010cakavian]] dialect of the Croatian language, maintaining a unique [[Shtokavian dialect|Jekavian]], known as [[Southeastern Chakavian]] variant possibly due to the influence from hundreds of years of association within the Dubrovnik Republic and also due to the island's remoteness.\n\nBefore the year 1000 AD the population of the island (then called \"Lagosta\") was mainly made by romanised Dalmatians of the [[Dalmatian City-States]]. But the first mentioned inhabitants of Lastovo were recorded two centuries later in the 13th century Republic of Ragusa's archives and in the ''[[Statute of Lastovo]]'', written in Italian and Latin: it clearly indicates that most of the population in that century had exclusively Croatian folk names.<ref name=jurica/> Only under Italian control in the 20th century, the island had again a majority of \"neolatin' speakers but they disappeared after [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFor many centuries the only religion on the island has been [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], which has contributed to the preservation of the Latin names of certain settlements.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Prose|section|date=December 2012}}\n* [[Dobri\u0107 Dobri\u010devi\u0107]] ''(Bonino de Bonini)'', one of the pioneers of [[printing]] in Europe.

The majority of the population lives on the {{convert|46|km2|0|abbr=out}} island of Lastovo.\n\nLastovo, like the rest of the [[Roman province of Dalmatia]], was settled by [[Illyrians]]. The Romans conquered and settled the entire area, retaining control until the [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] invasions and [[Migration Period|Slavic migrations]] in the 7th century. The Croats and other Slavic tribes subjugated by the Croats secured most of the Dalmatian seaboard, but [[Dalmatian City-States|some cities and islands]] (like Lagosta) of the [[romanisation (cultural)|romanised]] Dalmatians remained independent under the nominal rule of the Byzantines. In 1000 AD the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]] [[Battle of Lastovo (1000)|attacked and destroyed the settlement]] due to the island's participation in piracy along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast. After the Venetian domination, in the 13th century Lagosta joined the [[Republic of Ragusa]] where for several centuries it enjoyed a certain level of autonomy until the republic's conquest by the French, under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]] then ruled the island for the next century, then Italy for 30 years after [[World War I]], and finally Yugoslavia until it became a part of the independent Republic of [[Croatia]].\n\nThe island is noted for its 15th- and 16th-century Venetian architecture. There is a large number of churches of relatively small size, a testament to the island's long-standing [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] tradition. The major cultural event is the [[Lastovo Poklad|Poklade]], or carnival. The island largely relies on its natural environment to attract tourists each season. In 2006 the [[Croatian Government]] made the island and its archipelago a nature park.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.lastovo.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=85&Itemid=64&lang=hr\n| title=Lastovsko oto\u010dje \u2013 11. hrvatski park prirode\n| work=www.lastovo.org\n| publisher=Park prirode Lastovo\n| language=Croatian\n| accessdate=2009-05-12\n}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lastovo and the surrounding islands.jpg|300px|left|thumbnail|Lastovo and surrounding islands]]\n[[File:2014-10-24 06-56-31 Croatia Dubrovacko-Neretvanska Oskoru\u0161no.jpg|left|thumbnail|Aerial view of Lastovo]]\nThe island of Lastovo belongs to the central Dalmatian archipelago.

His source was [[Theopompus]], a 4th-century BC [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian. The names of numerous other Illyric settlements along the coast had the same suffix ''-est'' which indicates its [[Illyrian languages|Illyric]] origins. When the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] conquered Dalmatia they gave the island the Latin name '''Augusta Insula''' meaning \"Emperor's Island\". During the [[Middle Ages]], the name would be transcribed as ''Augusta'', ''Lagusta'' or ''Lagosta''. The Slavic suffix ''[[-ovo]]'' combined with the Roman form of ''Lasta'' gives the islands present name of ''Lastovo''.<ref name=belamaric/>\n\nThe first traces of human presence on the island were found in the Ra\u010da cave where continuous evidence of habitation reaches as far as the late [[Neolithic Age]]. In prehistoric times the island was inhabited by the Illyrians. However finds of Greek ceramics show that the island was on one of the Greek trade routes on the Adriatic and probably a part of the state of [[Vis (island)|Issa]].<ref name=belamaric/>\n\nWhen the Romans conquered the province of Dalmatia they too settled Lastovo. The Romans named the island '''Augusta Insula'''. The Romans left traces of their long rule on the island, in the form of the so-called ''[[villa rustica]]'' estates (residential farming units) and the water catchment areas known as the ''lokve''. The Romans established a settlement on location of today's village of [[Ubli, Lastovo|Ubli]] that flourished during first centuries AD, only to become completely abandoned in later centuries after being destroyed by the barbarians.<ref name=belamaric/>\n\n===Middle Ages===\nWith the arrival of the [[Croats]] to Adriatic in the 7th century, Croats eventually settled most of Dalmatia which included Lastovo. Around 950, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos]] mentions Lastovo in his ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' by its [[Croatian language|Croatian]] name ''Lastobon''.<ref name=dai>{{cite book\n| last = [[Constantine VII]]\n| year = c. 950\n| title = [[De Administrando Imperio]]\n}}</ref> In 998 the [[Venetian Doge]] [[Pietro Orseolo II]] launched large military operations against Croatian and Neretvian pirates along the Adriatic and its islands, which culminated in 1000 with the [[Battle of Lastovo (1000)|destruction of the town of Lastovo]]. After that the residents (''Lastovci'' or ''Lastov\u010dani'') decided to build a city on the internal hill away from the coast which made the city more defendable. During the next two centuries, inhabitants dedicated themselves more to agriculture and neglected their earlier naval tradition.<ref name=jurica/> Scarcity of accurate historical documents and an almost complete silence covering the events on the island in the early Middle Ages are trustworthy signs of a great autonomy of Lastovo in that period. Lastovo may have at times come briefly under various rulers from the 7th to 13th centuries, whether [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Duklja]]n or [[Narentine]], however, it is accepted that Lastovo generally recognised the [[Kings of Croatia|Croatian kings]] as its nominal and natural rulers.<ref name=belamaric/><ref name=jurica/> In 1185 the [[Hvar diocese]] is formed of which Lastovo is mentioned as having been part. A church synod held in Split that same year decreed that the [[diocese of Hvar]] should fall under the authority of the [[Archbishop of Split]].\n\n===Republic of Ragusa===\n[[File:Pecat.gif|thumb|left|Lastovo commune's official seal known as the Pe\u010dat within the Republic of Ragusa]]\nLater in the 13th century the people of Lastovo voluntarily joined the [[Republic of Ragusa]]  in 1252 after the republic promised that it would honour Lastovo's internal autonomy.

Continuous limitation of the island's autonomy and higher taxes led to a short lived rebellion in 1602. On the appeal of islanders, [[Venice]] occupied the island the following year and held it until 1606, when it was returned to Ragusa. The next attempt at rebellion was in 1652, which resulted in the loss of the island's autonomy.<ref name=jurica/>\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquests, Lastovo was very often a target of [[pirate]]s from [[Ulcinj]], leading to the introduction of mandatory guard service. Guard service was abolished in the 18th century when pirates from Ulcinj became merchant sailors. The last reported outbreak of ''[[vampirism]]'' in Croatia was 'recorded' on Lastovo. The trial in Ragusa in 1737 took testimony from visitors to the island during an outbreak of ''severe diarrhoea'' which killed many locals. The islanders blamed this epidemic on vampires. This case included from Lastovo the defendants who formed a band or group of vigilante style vampire hunters. Such cases were reported throughout all of Croatia and indeed Europe in the Middle Ages.<ref name=\"liepopili\">Liepopili, Ante (1918). \"Vukodlaci\" (in Croatian).

When they abolished the Republic in 1808, Lastovo became part of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and was included in the Napoleonic \"Kingdom of Italy\". The French built a fortification on Glavica hill and mobilised islanders against the British. Between 18 January and 3 February 1813, the [[Royal Navy]] [[sailing frigate|frigate]] [[HMS Apollo (1805)|HMS ''Apollo'']] and troops captured Lastovo and [[Kor\u010dula]]. The British held the island until 1815 when the [[Congress of Vienna]] awarded the island to the [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg Empire]]. After 1815, Lastovo was part of Dubrovnik county in the Austrian province of [[Dalmatia]]. Until 1829, it had its own court, but later the island fell under the jurisdiction of the court in [[Kor\u010dula]]. In the 1840s, the municipality fell into a deep economic crisis that resulted in its selling most of its forests to foreigners.<ref name=jurica/>\n\n[[File:Lagosta 1900 Lastovo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Austrian KK tax stamp cancelled in 1900, with both ''Croatian'' and ''Italian'' names]]\n\n===20th century===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2009}}\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] established a military garrison on Glavica consisting mostly of Hungarian troops. The authorities ordered blackouts and forbade the ringing of church bells during the war. At the end of 1917 four French planes  bombed Lastovo. Some French troops landed on the island to reconnoiter it. Italian forces soon followed and clashed with the garrison. Some members of the Austro-Hungarian garrison escaped. The Italians took those they caught to Italy as [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. A French plane dropping leaflets on the island on 4 November brought the news that the war was finally over. On 11 November 1918 Italian troops took possession of the island based on the [[Treaty of London (1915)|1915 Secret Treaty of London]], which allocated much of Dalmatia to Italy upon Italy entering the war on the side of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. The Italians based their claim upon the presence of ethnic Italians in all parts of maritime Dalmatia. However, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who was a supporter of the nationality principle, blocked the allocation.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n[[File:Lastovo Ort.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Town of Lastovo]]\nAs a consequence, under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo agreement]] of 1920, Italy received in Dalmatia only Zara (today [[Zadar]]), due to its Italian majority, and Lagosta. Although the Italian population was in the minority, it was smaller than other Dalmatian places such as [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (Lissa){{Clarify|date=September 2012}}. After the advent of Fascism in Italy (1922), the Italians followed a policy of [[Italianization]] in all its possessions. At the same time, living standards improved. Many public works were started, and the island reached its peak population of approximately 2,000. This growth resulted in part from the immigration from other Dalmatian towns, of ethnic Italians who wished to live under Italian rule.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn 1941 the [[Axis Powers]] attacked Yugoslavia, which collapsed in few days.  Italy annexed part of Dalmatia; the remainder became part of the new [[Independent State of Croatia]]. On September 8, 1943, after the declaration of the [[Armistice with Italy]], the Italian Army collapsed and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] took over the island, incorporating it into [[Yugoslavia]]. Lastovo became a part of the [[History of Croatia|People's Republic of Croatia]] in 1945\u2014one of the six Republics of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and into the [[History of Croatia|Socialist Republic of Croatia]] \u2014 one of the republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in 1953.<ref name=jurica/> At this time all the Italian residents left the island.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Lastovo experienced the same fate as the neighbouring island [[Vis (island)|Vis]].  The island became a military region barred to foreign nationals.  The barring of foreign nationals led to economic stagnation and the depopulation of the island.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In 1988 the ban was lifted and foreign tourists were again allowed to visit the island.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, but the Yugoslav People's Army only left its bases on Lastovo, one of its last footholds in Croatia, in July 1992. The war in Croatia ended in 1995. Lastovo escaped much of the devastation that swept across some parts of Croatia and most of neighbouring Bosnia.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Demographics==\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%\">\n{| style=\"float:right;\"  class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Population<ref>''Nautical Tourism Development in the Lastovo Islands Nature Park'', p. 6</ref>\n|-\n!

All the island residents participate by wearing folk costumes. The origins of the Lastovo carnival go back to a historical event. Legend has it that [[Catalan people|Catalan]] pirates attacked neighbouring [[Kor\u010dula]] and sent a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] messenger to Lastovo to tell the islanders to surrender or they would be next. The inhabitants of Lastovo did not let themselves be intimidated \u2014 instead they armed themselves and went on the attack. The women and children prayed to Sv. Jure ''([[St. George]])'' for help and their prayers were answered: a storm destroyed the pirates' ships and the inhabitants of Lastovo caught the messenger. In order to mock him, he was taken through the village on the back of a donkey and was afterwards sentenced and burned to death. This event is celebrated through the [[Lastovo Poklad|Poklad]] every year over a period of three days. The event takes place in the middle of February and since the summer 2006 it has become main attraction for tourists.  Locals enjoy this event very much and Lastovci from all around Croatia return to Lastovo to attend the carnival.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.adriatica.net/croatia/feature/lastovo_en.htm\n| title = Lastovo \u2013 Carnival Island\n| accessdate = 6 March 2011\n| publisher = Adriatica.net\n}} Permission was granted by the website to publish the text under the terms of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]].</ref>\n\n=== Churches ===\n[[File:Kuzma.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Lastovo|Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian]]]]\nThe main church is the [[Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Lastovo|Church of Saints Cosmas and Damian]] ({{lang|hr|Crkva sv.

Another church called St Peter in Ubli built somewhere in the 11th\u201313th centuries was demolished by the Italians in 1933 to make way for extra fishing sheds.<ref name=jurica/> All together there are a total of 46 churches, making the number [[46 (number)|46]] omnipresent since the island also has 46 hills, covers {{convert|46|km2|0|abbr=on}}, has 46 fields, and contains 46 islands in the archipelago.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n=== Architecture ===\n[[File:fumar.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Fumar]]\nThe town's buildings date mainly from the 15th and 16th centuries when the construction of about 20 [[Renaissance]] houses redefined the village's appearance. Most of them have high broad terraces which have become the ''\"trade mark\"'' look of Lastovo houses. Their unusual cylindrical chimneys that the locals call ''fumari'' are picturesque and unusual since they look like miniature minarets, although there is no record of Arab or Turkish influence ever directly reaching this area. The ornate chimney on the 16th century Biza Antica house is probably the oldest preserved chimney in Dalmatia. The Struga lighthouse built in 1839 on Lastovo's southern tip near [[Skrivena Luka]] is one of the oldest lighthouses in Croatia.<ref name=jurica/>\n\n===Language===\nInhabitants speak the [[Chakavian|\u010cakavian]] dialect of the Croatian language, maintaining a unique [[Shtokavian dialect|Jekavian]], known as [[Southeastern Chakavian]] variant possibly due to the influence from hundreds of years of association within the Dubrovnik Republic and also due to the island's remoteness.\n\nBefore the year 1000 AD the population of the island (then called \"Lagosta\") was mainly made by romanised Dalmatians of the [[Dalmatian City-States]]. But the first mentioned inhabitants of Lastovo were recorded two centuries later in the 13th century Republic of Ragusa's archives and in the ''[[Statute of Lastovo]]'', written in Italian and Latin: it clearly indicates that most of the population in that century had exclusively Croatian folk names.<ref name=jurica/> Only under Italian control in the 20th century, the island had again a majority of \"neolatin' speakers but they disappeared after [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nFor many centuries the only religion on the island has been [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], which has contributed to the preservation of the Latin names of certain settlements.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Prose|section|date=December 2012}}\n* [[Dobri\u0107 Dobri\u010devi\u0107]] ''(Bonino de Bonini)'', one of the pioneers of [[printing]] in Europe.

South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|outbreak of MERS]] in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day. In neighboring Japan, only about 2,700 people in total have been tested for COVID-19 as of 3 March. Officials in [[Seoul]] operate \"drive-thru\" testing stations for quick testing.

South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women.

South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|outbreak of MERS]] in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day. In neighboring Japan, only about 2,700 people in total have been tested for COVID-19 as of 3 March. Officials in [[Seoul]] operate \"drive-thru\" testing stations for quick testing.

South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women.

The effect of climate on agriculture is related to variabilities in local climates rather than in global climate patterns. The Earth's average surface temperature has increased by 1.5&nbsp;\u00b0F (0.83&nbsp;[[\u00b0C]]) since 1880. Consequently, in making an assessment [[agronomist]]s must consider each [[ecoregion|local area]].\n\nOn the other hand, [[agricultural economics|agricultural trade]] has grown in recent years, and now provides significant amounts of food, on a national level to major importing countries, as well as comfortable [[gross domestic product|income]] to exporting ones. The international aspect of trade and security in terms of food implies the need to also consider the [[effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] on a global scale.\n\nA 2008 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' suggested that, due to climate change, \"southern Africa could lose more than 30% of its main crop, maize, by 2030. In South Asia losses of many regional staples, such as rice, millet and maize could top 10%\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7220807.stm | title=Climate 'could devastate crops' | date=31 January 2008 |work=BBC News}}</ref>{{sfn|Lobell|others|2008a}}\n\nThe [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has produced several reports that have assessed the [[scientific literature]] on climate change. The [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]], published in 2001, concluded that the poorest countries would be hardest hit, with reductions in crop yields in most tropical and sub-tropical regions due to decreased water availability, and new or changed insect pest incidence. In Africa and Latin America many rainfed crops are near their maximum temperature tolerance, so that yields are likely to fall sharply for even small climate changes; falls in agricultural productivity of up to 30% over the 21st century are projected. Marine life and the [[Fisheries and climate change|fishing industry]] will also be severely affected in some places.\n\nIn the report published in 2014 the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] says that the world may reach \"a threshold of global warming beyond which current agricultural practices can no longer support large human civilizations.\" by the middle of the 21st century. In 2019 it published reports in which it says that millions already suffer from food insecurity due to climate change and predicted decline in global crop production of 2% - 6% by decade.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=K.R. |last2=Woodward |first2=A. |last3=Campbell-Lendrum |first3=D. |last4=Chadee |first4=D.D. |last5=Honda |first5=Y. |last6=Liu |first6=Q. |last7=Olwoch |first7=J.M. |last8=Revich |first8=B. |last9=Sauerborn |first9=R. |title=Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability.

For example, average crop yield is expected to drop down to 50% in Pakistan according to the [[Met Office]] scenario whereas corn production in Europe is expected to grow up to 25% in optimum [[hydrologic]] conditions.\n\nMore favourable effects on yield tend to depend to a large extent on realization of the potentially [[beneficial effects of global warming|beneficial effects of carbon dioxide on crop growth]] and increase of efficiency in [[water use]]. Decrease in potential yields is likely to be caused by shortening of the growing period, decrease in water availability and poor [[vernalization]].\n\nIn the long run, the climatic change could affect agriculture in several ways :\n* ''productivity'', in terms of [[quantity]] and [[Quality (business)|quality]] of crops\n* ''agricultural practices'', through changes of water use (irrigation) and agricultural inputs such as [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s\n* ''environmental effects'', in particular in relation of frequency and intensity of soil [[drainage]] (leading to nitrogen leaching), [[soil erosion]], reduction of [[biodiversity|crop diversity]]\n* ''rural space'', through the loss and gain of cultivated lands, land [[speculation]], land renunciation, and hydraulic amenities.\n* ''adaptation'', organisms may become more or less competitive, as well as humans may develop urgency to develop more competitive organisms, such as flood resistant or [[Crop tolerance to seawater|salt resistant]] varieties of rice.\n\nThey are large uncertainties to uncover, particularly because there is lack of information on many specific local regions, and include the uncertainties on magnitude of climate change, the effects of technological changes on productivity, global food demands, and the numerous possibilities of adaptation.\n\nMost agronomists believe that agricultural production will be mostly affected by the severity and pace of climate change, not so much by gradual trends in climate. If change is gradual, there may be enough time for [[biota (ecology)|biota]] adjustment. Rapid climate change, however, could harm agriculture in many countries, especially those that are already suffering from rather poor soil and climate conditions, because there is less time for optimum [[natural selection]] and adaption.\n\nBut much remains unknown about exactly how [[climate change]] may affect farming and [[food security]], in part because the role of farmer behaviour is poorly captured by crop-climate models.  For instance, Evan Fraser, a geographer at the [[University of Guelph]] in [[Ontario]] [[Canada]], has conducted a number of studies that show that the socio-economic context of farming may play a huge role in determining whether a [[drought]] has a major, or an insignificant impact on crop production.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fraser | first1 = E | year = 2007a | title = Travelling in antique lands: Studying past famines to understand present vulnerabilities to climate change | journal = Climate Change | volume = 83 | issue = 4| pages = 495\u2013514 | doi=10.1007/s10584-007-9240-9}}</ref><ref name=\"Simelton, E. 2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Simelton E, Fraser E, Termansen M | year = 2009 | title = Typologies of crop-drought vulnerability: an empirical analysis of the socio-economic factors that influence the sensitivity and resilience to drought of three major food crops in China (1961\u20132001) | journal = Environmental Science & Policy | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 438\u2013452 | doi=10.1016/j.envsci.2008.11.005}}</ref> In some cases, it seems that even minor droughts have big impacts on food security (such as what happened in [[Ethiopia]] in the early 1980s where a minor drought triggered a massive [[famine]]), versus cases where even relatively large weather-related problems were adapted to without much hardship.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fraser ED, Termansen M, Sun N, Guan D, Simelton E, Dodds P, Feng K, Yu Y | year = 2008 | title = Quantifying socio economic characteristics of drought sensitive regions: evidence from Chinese provincial agricultural data | journal = Comptes Rendus Geoscience | volume = 340 | issue = 9\u201310| pages = 679\u2013688 | doi=10.1016/j.crte.2008.07.004| bibcode = 2008CRGeo.340..679F }}</ref> Evan Fraser combines socio-economic models along with climatic models to identify \"vulnerability hotspots\"<ref name=\"Simelton, E. 2009\"/> One such study has identified [[Corn production in the United States|US maize (corn) production]] as particularly vulnerable to climate change because it is expected to be exposed to worse droughts, but it does not have the socio-economic conditions that suggest farmers will adapt to these changing conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fraser ED, Simelton E, Termansen M, Gosling SN, South A | year = 2013 | title = 'Vulnerability hotspots': integrating socio-economic and hydrological models to identify where cereal production may decline due to climate change induced drought | journal = Agricultural and Forest Meteorology | volume = 170 | pages = 195\u2013205 | doi=10.1016/j.agrformet.2012.04.008}}</ref> Other studies rely instead on projections of key agro-meteorological or agro-climate indices, such as growing season length, plant heat stress, or start of field operations, identified by land management stakeholders and that provide useful information on mechanisms driving climate change impact on agriculture.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Harding AE, Rivington M, Mineter MJ, Tett SF | year = 2015 | title = Agro-meteorological indices and climate model uncertainty over the UK | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 128 | issue =1 | pages = 113\u2013126 | doi=10.1007/s10584-014-1296-8| bibcode = 2015ClCh..128..113H | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors =Monier E, Xu L, Snyder R | year = 2016 | title = Uncertainty in future agro-climate projections in the United States and benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation | journal = Environmental Research Letters | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 055001 | doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/5/055001| bibcode = 2016ERL....11e5001M | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n=== Pest insects and climate change ===\nGlobal warming could lead to an increase in pest insect populations, harming yields of staple crops like [[wheat]], [[soybean]]s, and corn.<ref name=\"Live Science\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/4296-global-warming-trigger-insect-population-boom.html|title=Global Warming Could Trigger Insect Population Boom|work=Live Science|access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref> While warmer temperatures create longer growing seasons, and faster growth rates for plants, it also increases the metabolic rate and number of breeding cycles of insect populations.<ref name=\"Live Science\"/> Insects that previously had only two breeding cycles per year could gain an additional cycle if warm growing seasons extend, causing a population boom.

These studies found that the soybeans with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels grew much faster and had higher yields, but attracted [[Japanese beetle]]s at a significantly higher rate than the control field.<ref name=\"Union of Concerned Scientists\"/> The beetles in the field with increased CO<sub>2</sub> also laid more eggs on the soybean plants and had longer lifespans, indicating the possibility of a rapidly expanding population. DeLucia projected that if the project were to continue, the field with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels would eventually show lower yields than that of the control field.<ref name=\"Union of Concerned Scientists\"/>\n\nThe increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels deactivated three genes within the soybean plant that normally create chemical defenses against pest insects. One of these defenses is a protein that blocks digestion of the soy leaves in insects. Since this gene was deactivated, the beetles were able to digest a much higher amount of plant matter than the beetles in the control field. This led to the observed longer lifespans and higher egg-laying rates in the experimental field.<ref name=\"Union of Concerned Scientists\"/>\n\nThere are a few proposed solutions to the issue of expanding pest populations.

This solution is beneficial in its overall environmental impact. Not only are more native plants getting planted, but pest insects are no longer building up an immunity to pesticides.

Access has been affected by the thousands of crops being destroyed, how communities are dealing with climate shocks and adapting to climate change. Prices on food will rise due to the shortage of food production due to conditions not being favourable for crop production. Utilization is affected by floods and drought where water resources are contaminated, and the changing temperatures create vicious stages and phases of disease. Availability is affected by the contamination of the crops, as there will be no food process for the products of these crops as a result. Stability is affected through price ranges and future prices as some food sources are becoming scarce due to climate change, so prices will rise.\n\n====Individual studies====\n\n[[File:Projected effect of climate change on agricultural productivity for different regions (Cline, 2007).png|alt=Refer to caption and adjacent text|thumb|upright=2|right|Projections by Cline (2008)<ref name=\"cline projections\"/>]]\nCline (2008)<ref name=\"cline projections\">\n{{harvnb|Cline|2008}}\n</ref> looked at how climate change might affect agricultural productivity in the 2080s.

The 2019 [[European Environment Agency]] report \"Climate change adaptation in the agricultural sector in Europe\" again confirmed this. According to this 2019 report, projections indicate that yields of non-irrigated crops like wheat, corn and sugar beet would decrease in southern Europe by up to 50% by 2050 (under a high-end emission scenario). This could result in a substantial decrease in farm income by that date. Also farmland values are projected to decrease in parts of southern Europe by more than 80% by 2100, which could result in land abandonment. The trade patterns are also said to be impacted, in turn affecting agricultural income.

This projection was assigned \"high confidence.\"\n\n=== Climate change impacts affecting poverty alleviation===\n\nResearchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) have investigated the potential impacts climate change could have on agriculture, and how this would affect attempts at alleviating poverty in the [[developing world]].<ref name=\"ccandpoverty\"/> They argued that the effects from moderate climate change are likely to be mixed for developing countries. However, the vulnerability of the poor in developing countries to short-term impacts from climate change, notably the increased frequency and severity of adverse weather events is likely to have a negative impact. This, they say, should be taken into account when defining [[agricultural policy]].<ref name=\"ccandpoverty\">{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1231&title=climate-change-agricultural-policy-poverty-reduction-much-know |title= Climate change, agricultural policy and poverty reduction \u2013 how much do we know? |year=2007 |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Crop development models ===\n\nModels for climate behavior are frequently inconclusive. In order to further study effects of global warming on agriculture, other types of models, such as ''crop development models'', ''yield prediction'', quantities of ''water or fertilizer consumed'', can be used. Such models condense the knowledge accumulated of the climate, soil, and effects observed of the results of various [[agricultural practices]]. They thus could make it possible to test strategies of adaptation to modifications of the environment.\n\nBecause these models are necessarily simplifying natural conditions (often based on the assumption that weeds, disease and insect [[pest (animal)|pests]] are controlled), it is not clear whether the results they give will have an ''in-field'' reality. However, some results are partly validated with an increasing number of experimental results.\n\nOther models, such as ''insect and disease development'' models based on climate projections are also used (for example simulation of [[aphid]] reproduction or [[septoria]] (cereal fungal disease) development).\n\nScenarios are used in order to estimate climate changes effects on crop development and yield. Each scenario is defined as a set of [[meteorological]] variables, based on generally accepted projections. For example, many models are running simulations based on doubled [[carbon dioxide]] projections, temperatures raise ranging from 1&nbsp;\u00b0C up to 5&nbsp;\u00b0C, and with rainfall levels an increase or decrease of 20%. Other parameters may include [[humidity]], wind, and [[solar variation|solar activity]]. Scenarios of crop models are testing farm-level adaptation, such as sowing date shift, climate adapted species ([[vernalisation]] need, heat and cold resistance), [[irrigation]] and fertilizer adaptation, resistance to disease. Most developed models are about wheat, maize, rice and [[soybean]].\n\n=== Temperature potential effect on growing period ===\n\nDuration of crop [[cell growth|growth]] [[biological life cycle|cycles]] are above all, related to temperature.

For rice, the amylose content of the grain\u2014a major determinant of cooking quality\u2014is increased under elevated CO<sub>2</sub>\" (Conroy et al., 1994). Cooked rice grain from plants grown in high-{{CO2}} environments would be firmer than that from today's plants. However, concentrations of iron and zinc, which are important for human nutrition, would be lower (Seneweera and Conroy, 1997). Moreover, the protein content of the grain decreases under combined increases of temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> (Ziska et al., 1997).<ref>[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/208.htm \"Climate

Vietnam for example relies heavily on its southern tip, where the Mekong Delta lies, for rice planting. Any rise in sea level of no more than a meter will drown several km<sup>2</sup> of rice paddies, rendering Vietnam incapable of producing its main staple and export of rice.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Coping With Climate Change|first=Reiner|last=Wassmann| name-list-format = vanc |journal=Rice Today|publisher=IRRI|date=July\u2013September 2007|pages=10\u201315|url=http://www.irri.org/publications/today/pdfs/6-3/10-15.pdf |access-date=2009-10-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327094148/http://www.irri.org/publications/today/pdfs/6-3/10-15.pdf |archive-date=27 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\n=== Erosion and fertility ===\nThe warmer atmospheric temperatures observed over the past decades are expected to lead to a more vigorous hydrological cycle, including more extreme rainfall events.  [[Erosion]] and [[soil degradation]] is more likely to occur.  Soil [[fertility]] would also be affected by global warming. Increased erosion in agricultural landscapes from anthropogenic factors can occur with losses of up to 22% of soil carbon in 50 years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Doetterl|first=Sebastian|last2=Oost|first2=Kristof Van|last3=Six|first3=Johan| name-list-format = vanc |date=2012-05-01|title=Towards constraining the magnitude of global agricultural sediment and soil organic carbon fluxes|journal=Earth Surface Processes and Landforms|language=en|volume=37|issue=6|pages=642\u2013655|doi=10.1002/esp.3198|issn=1096-9837|hdl=2078.1/123112|bibcode=2012ESPL...37..642D}}</ref> However, because the ratio of soil organic carbon to nitrogen is mediated by soil biology such that it maintains a narrow range, a doubling of soil organic carbon is likely to imply a doubling in the storage of [[nitrogen]] in soils as organic nitrogen, thus providing higher available nutrient levels for plants, supporting higher yield potential. The demand for imported fertilizer nitrogen could decrease, and provide the opportunity for changing costly [[fertilisation]] strategies.\n\nDue to the extremes of climate that would result, the increase in precipitations would probably result in greater risks of erosion, whilst at the same time providing soil with better hydration, according to the intensity of the rain. The possible evolution of the [[organic matter]] in the soil is a highly contested issue: while the increase in the temperature would induce a greater rate in the production of [[minerals]], lessening the [[soil organic matter]] content, the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would tend to increase it.\n\n=== Potential effects of global climate change on pests, diseases and weeds ===\nA very important point to consider is that weeds would undergo the same acceleration of cycle as cultivated crops, and would also benefit from carbonaceous fertilization. Since most weeds are C3 plants, they are likely to compete even more than now against C4 crops such as corn. However, on the other hand, some results make it possible to think that [[weedkiller]]s could increase in effectiveness with the temperature increase.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Early Summer Weed Control|url=http://extension.unl.edu/statewide/sw3/6.17.15%20Early%20Summer%20Weed%20Control.pdf|journal=-}}</ref>\n\nGlobal warming would cause an increase in rainfall in some areas, which would lead to an increase of atmospheric humidity and the duration of the [[wet season]]s. Combined with higher temperatures, these could favour the development of [[fungi|fungal]] diseases. Similarly, because of higher temperatures and humidity, there could be an increased pressure from insects and [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vectors]].\n\n=== Glacier retreat and disappearance ===\nThe continued [[Effects of global warming#Glacier retreat and disappearance|retreat of glaciers]] will have a number of different quantitative impacts. In the areas that are heavily dependent on [[Surface runoff|water runoff]] from [[glaciers]] that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished.\n\nApproximately 2.4&nbsp;billion people live in the [[drainage basin]] of the Himalayan rivers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.peopleandplanet.net/pdoc.php?id=3024 | title = Big melt threatens millions, says UN | archive-url =  https://web.archive.org/web/20080219045312/http://www.peopleandplanet.net/pdoc.php?id=3024 | archive-date = 19 February 2008 | work = People & the Planet }}</ref> [[India]], China, [[Pakistan]], Afghanistan, [[Bangladesh]], Nepal and [[Myanmar]] could experience floods followed by severe droughts in coming decades.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90781/90879/6222327.html |work = People's Daily Online | title = Glaciers melting at alarming speed}}</ref> In [[India]] alone, the Ganges provides water for drinking and farming for more than 500 million people.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/jul/24indus.htm | title = Ganges, Indus may not survive: climatologists | date = 24 July 2007 | work = Rediff.com India Limited }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3998967.stm|title=Himalaya glaciers melt unnoticed|date=10 November 2004|via=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The west coast of North America, which gets much of its water from glaciers in mountain ranges such as the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], also would be affected.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080317154235.htm | title = Glaciers Are Melting Faster Than Expected, UN Reports | work = ScienceDaily }}</ref>\n\n=== Ozone and UV-B ===\nSome scientists think agriculture could be affected by any decrease in [[stratospheric ozone]], which could increase biologically dangerous [[ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation B]].

Crops that lie on the equatorial belt or under the tropical Walker circulation, such as rice, will be affected by varying monsoon patterns and more unpredictable weather. Scheduled planting and harvesting based on weather patterns will become less effective.\n\nAreas such as Indonesia where the main crop consists of rice will be more vulnerable to the increased intensity of ENSO effects in the future of climate change. University of Washington professor, [[David Battisti]], researched the effects of future ENSO patterns on the Indonesian rice agriculture using [IPCC]'s 2007 annual report<ref>IPCC. Climate Change 2007: Synthesis Report. United Nations Environment Programme, 2007:Ch5, 8, and 10.[http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr.pdf]</ref> and 20 different logistical models mapping out climate factors such as wind pressure, sea-level, and humidity, and found that rice harvest will experience a decrease in yield.

This adaptation and mitigation potential is nowhere more pronounced than in developing countries where agricultural productivity remains low; poverty, vulnerability and food insecurity remain high; and the direct effects of climate change are expected to be especially harsh. Creating the necessary agricultural technologies and harnessing them to enable developing countries to adapt their agricultural systems to changing climate will require innovations in policy and institutions as well.  In this context, institutions and policies are important at multiple scales.\n\nTravis Lybbert and Daniel Sumner suggest six policy principles:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lybbert |first1=Travis J. |last2=Sumner |first2=Daniel A. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Agricultural technologies for climate change in developing countries: Policy options for innovation and technology diffusion |journal=Food Policy |date=February 2012 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=114\u2013123 |doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2011.11.001 }}</ref>\n#The best policy and institutional responses will enhance information flows, incentives and flexibility.\n#Policies and institutions that promote economic development and reduce poverty will often improve agricultural adaptation and may also pave the way for more effective climate change mitigation through agriculture.\n#Business as usual among the world's poor is not adequate.\n#Existing technology options must be made more available and accessible without overlooking complementary capacity and investments.\n#Adaptation and mitigation in [[agriculture]] will require local responses, but effective policy responses must also reflect global impacts and inter-linkages.\n#[[Trade]] will play a critical role in both mitigation and adaptation, but will itself be shaped importantly by climate change.\n\nThe Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP)<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.worldscientific.com/page/pressroom/2015-03-10-02 |title=Food for the Future - Assessments of Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture |publisher=Imperial College Press |date=April 2015 |access-date=17 July 2019 }}</ref> was developed in 2010 to evaluate agricultural models and intercompare their ability to predict climate impacts. In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, South America and East Asia, AgMIP regional research teams (RRTs) are conducting integrated assessments to improve understanding of agricultural impacts of climate change (including biophysical and [[economic impacts of climate change|economic impacts]]) at national and regional scales. Other AgMIP initiatives include global gridded modeling, data and information technology (IT) tool development, simulation of crop pests and diseases, site-based crop-climate sensitivity studies, and aggregation and scaling.\n\nOne of the most important projects to mitigate climate change with agriculture and adapting agriculture to climate change at the same time, was launched in 2019 by the \"Global EverGreening Alliance\". The initiative was announced in the [[2019 UN Climate Action Summit]]. One of the main methods is [[Agroforestry]]. Another important method is [[Conservation farming]]. One of the targets is to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. By 2050 the restored land should sequestrate 20 billion of carbon annually. The coalition wants, among other, to recover with trees a territory of 5.75 million square kilometres, achieve a health tree - grass balance on a territory of 6.5 million square kilometres and increase carbon capture in a territory of 5 million square kilometres.\n\nThe first phase is the \"Grand African Savannah Green Up\" project. Already millions families implemented these methods, and the average territory covered with trees in the farms in [[Sahel]] increased to 16%.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoffner |first1=Erik |title=Grand African Savannah Green Up': Major $85 Million Project Announced to Scale up Agroforestry in Africa |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/agroforestry-africa-climate-summit-2641102482.html |accessdate=27 October 2019 |agency=Ecowatch |date=25 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Impact of agriculture on climate change ==\n{{update section|reason=it needs more recent info e.g. on plowing and soil|date=July 2019}}\n[[File:Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, by region, 1990-2010.png|thumb|right|upright=2|alt=refer to caption and image description|Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, by region, 1990-2010]]\nThe agricultural sector is a driving force in the gas emissions and land use effects thought to cause climate change.

The effect of climate on agriculture is related to variabilities in local climates rather than in global climate patterns. The Earth's average surface temperature has increased by 1.5&nbsp;\u00b0F (0.83&nbsp;[[\u00b0C]]) since 1880. Consequently, in making an assessment [[agronomist]]s must consider each [[ecoregion|local area]].\n\nOn the other hand, [[agricultural economics|agricultural trade]] has grown in recent years, and now provides significant amounts of food, on a national level to major importing countries, as well as comfortable [[gross domestic product|income]] to exporting ones. The international aspect of trade and security in terms of food implies the need to also consider the [[effects of global warming|effects of climate change]] on a global scale.\n\nA 2008 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' suggested that, due to climate change, \"southern Africa could lose more than 30% of its main crop, maize, by 2030. In South Asia losses of many regional staples, such as rice, millet and maize could top 10%\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7220807.stm | title=Climate 'could devastate crops' | date=31 January 2008 |work=BBC News}}</ref>{{sfn|Lobell|others|2008a}}\n\nThe [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) has produced several reports that have assessed the [[scientific literature]] on climate change. The [[IPCC Third Assessment Report]], published in 2001, concluded that the poorest countries would be hardest hit, with reductions in crop yields in most tropical and sub-tropical regions due to decreased water availability, and new or changed insect pest incidence. In Africa and Latin America many rainfed crops are near their maximum temperature tolerance, so that yields are likely to fall sharply for even small climate changes; falls in agricultural productivity of up to 30% over the 21st century are projected. Marine life and the [[Fisheries and climate change|fishing industry]] will also be severely affected in some places.\n\nIn the report published in 2014 the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] says that the world may reach \"a threshold of global warming beyond which current agricultural practices can no longer support large human civilizations.\" by the middle of the 21st century. In 2019 it published reports in which it says that millions already suffer from food insecurity due to climate change and predicted decline in global crop production of 2% - 6% by decade.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=K.R. |last2=Woodward |first2=A. |last3=Campbell-Lendrum |first3=D. |last4=Chadee |first4=D.D. |last5=Honda |first5=Y. |last6=Liu |first6=Q. |last7=Olwoch |first7=J.M. |last8=Revich |first8=B. |last9=Sauerborn |first9=R. |title=Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability.

For example, average crop yield is expected to drop down to 50% in Pakistan according to the [[Met Office]] scenario whereas corn production in Europe is expected to grow up to 25% in optimum [[hydrologic]] conditions.\n\nMore favourable effects on yield tend to depend to a large extent on realization of the potentially [[beneficial effects of global warming|beneficial effects of carbon dioxide on crop growth]] and increase of efficiency in [[water use]]. Decrease in potential yields is likely to be caused by shortening of the growing period, decrease in water availability and poor [[vernalization]].\n\nIn the long run, the climatic change could affect agriculture in several ways :\n* ''productivity'', in terms of [[quantity]] and [[Quality (business)|quality]] of crops\n* ''agricultural practices'', through changes of water use (irrigation) and agricultural inputs such as [[herbicide]]s, [[insecticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s\n* ''environmental effects'', in particular in relation of frequency and intensity of soil [[drainage]] (leading to nitrogen leaching), [[soil erosion]], reduction of [[biodiversity|crop diversity]]\n* ''rural space'', through the loss and gain of cultivated lands, land [[speculation]], land renunciation, and hydraulic amenities.\n* ''adaptation'', organisms may become more or less competitive, as well as humans may develop urgency to develop more competitive organisms, such as flood resistant or [[Crop tolerance to seawater|salt resistant]] varieties of rice.\n\nThey are large uncertainties to uncover, particularly because there is lack of information on many specific local regions, and include the uncertainties on magnitude of climate change, the effects of technological changes on productivity, global food demands, and the numerous possibilities of adaptation.\n\nMost agronomists believe that agricultural production will be mostly affected by the severity and pace of climate change, not so much by gradual trends in climate. If change is gradual, there may be enough time for [[biota (ecology)|biota]] adjustment. Rapid climate change, however, could harm agriculture in many countries, especially those that are already suffering from rather poor soil and climate conditions, because there is less time for optimum [[natural selection]] and adaption.\n\nBut much remains unknown about exactly how [[climate change]] may affect farming and [[food security]], in part because the role of farmer behaviour is poorly captured by crop-climate models.  For instance, Evan Fraser, a geographer at the [[University of Guelph]] in [[Ontario]] [[Canada]], has conducted a number of studies that show that the socio-economic context of farming may play a huge role in determining whether a [[drought]] has a major, or an insignificant impact on crop production.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fraser | first1 = E | year = 2007a | title = Travelling in antique lands: Studying past famines to understand present vulnerabilities to climate change | journal = Climate Change | volume = 83 | issue = 4| pages = 495\u2013514 | doi=10.1007/s10584-007-9240-9}}</ref><ref name=\"Simelton, E. 2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Simelton E, Fraser E, Termansen M | year = 2009 | title = Typologies of crop-drought vulnerability: an empirical analysis of the socio-economic factors that influence the sensitivity and resilience to drought of three major food crops in China (1961\u20132001) | journal = Environmental Science & Policy | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 438\u2013452 | doi=10.1016/j.envsci.2008.11.005}}</ref> In some cases, it seems that even minor droughts have big impacts on food security (such as what happened in [[Ethiopia]] in the early 1980s where a minor drought triggered a massive [[famine]]), versus cases where even relatively large weather-related problems were adapted to without much hardship.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fraser ED, Termansen M, Sun N, Guan D, Simelton E, Dodds P, Feng K, Yu Y | year = 2008 | title = Quantifying socio economic characteristics of drought sensitive regions: evidence from Chinese provincial agricultural data | journal = Comptes Rendus Geoscience | volume = 340 | issue = 9\u201310| pages = 679\u2013688 | doi=10.1016/j.crte.2008.07.004| bibcode = 2008CRGeo.340..679F }}</ref> Evan Fraser combines socio-economic models along with climatic models to identify \"vulnerability hotspots\"<ref name=\"Simelton, E. 2009\"/> One such study has identified [[Corn production in the United States|US maize (corn) production]] as particularly vulnerable to climate change because it is expected to be exposed to worse droughts, but it does not have the socio-economic conditions that suggest farmers will adapt to these changing conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fraser ED, Simelton E, Termansen M, Gosling SN, South A | year = 2013 | title = 'Vulnerability hotspots': integrating socio-economic and hydrological models to identify where cereal production may decline due to climate change induced drought | journal = Agricultural and Forest Meteorology | volume = 170 | pages = 195\u2013205 | doi=10.1016/j.agrformet.2012.04.008}}</ref> Other studies rely instead on projections of key agro-meteorological or agro-climate indices, such as growing season length, plant heat stress, or start of field operations, identified by land management stakeholders and that provide useful information on mechanisms driving climate change impact on agriculture.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Harding AE, Rivington M, Mineter MJ, Tett SF | year = 2015 | title = Agro-meteorological indices and climate model uncertainty over the UK | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 128 | issue =1 | pages = 113\u2013126 | doi=10.1007/s10584-014-1296-8| bibcode = 2015ClCh..128..113H | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors =Monier E, Xu L, Snyder R | year = 2016 | title = Uncertainty in future agro-climate projections in the United States and benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation | journal = Environmental Research Letters | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 055001 | doi=10.1088/1748-9326/11/5/055001| bibcode = 2016ERL....11e5001M | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n=== Pest insects and climate change ===\nGlobal warming could lead to an increase in pest insect populations, harming yields of staple crops like [[wheat]], [[soybean]]s, and corn.<ref name=\"Live Science\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/4296-global-warming-trigger-insect-population-boom.html|title=Global Warming Could Trigger Insect Population Boom|work=Live Science|access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref> While warmer temperatures create longer growing seasons, and faster growth rates for plants, it also increases the metabolic rate and number of breeding cycles of insect populations.<ref name=\"Live Science\"/> Insects that previously had only two breeding cycles per year could gain an additional cycle if warm growing seasons extend, causing a population boom.

These studies found that the soybeans with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels grew much faster and had higher yields, but attracted [[Japanese beetle]]s at a significantly higher rate than the control field.<ref name=\"Union of Concerned Scientists\"/> The beetles in the field with increased CO<sub>2</sub> also laid more eggs on the soybean plants and had longer lifespans, indicating the possibility of a rapidly expanding population. DeLucia projected that if the project were to continue, the field with elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels would eventually show lower yields than that of the control field.<ref name=\"Union of Concerned Scientists\"/>\n\nThe increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels deactivated three genes within the soybean plant that normally create chemical defenses against pest insects. One of these defenses is a protein that blocks digestion of the soy leaves in insects. Since this gene was deactivated, the beetles were able to digest a much higher amount of plant matter than the beetles in the control field. This led to the observed longer lifespans and higher egg-laying rates in the experimental field.<ref name=\"Union of Concerned Scientists\"/>\n\nThere are a few proposed solutions to the issue of expanding pest populations.

This solution is beneficial in its overall environmental impact. Not only are more native plants getting planted, but pest insects are no longer building up an immunity to pesticides. However, planting additional native plants requires more room, which destroys additional acres of public land.

Access has been affected by the thousands of crops being destroyed, how communities are dealing with climate shocks and adapting to climate change. Prices on food will rise due to the shortage of food production due to conditions not being favourable for crop production. Utilization is affected by floods and drought where water resources are contaminated, and the changing temperatures create vicious stages and phases of disease. Availability is affected by the contamination of the crops, as there will be no food process for the products of these crops as a result. Stability is affected through price ranges and future prices as some food sources are becoming scarce due to climate change, so prices will rise.\n\n====Individual studies====\n\n[[File:Projected effect of climate change on agricultural productivity for different regions (Cline, 2007).png|alt=Refer to caption and adjacent text|thumb|upright=2|right|Projections by Cline (2008)<ref name=\"cline projections\"/>]]\nCline (2008)<ref name=\"cline projections\">\n{{harvnb|Cline|2008}}\n</ref> looked at how climate change might affect agricultural productivity in the 2080s.

The 2019 [[European Environment Agency]] report \"Climate change adaptation in the agricultural sector in Europe\" again confirmed this. According to this 2019 report, projections indicate that yields of non-irrigated crops like wheat, corn and sugar beet would decrease in southern Europe by up to 50% by 2050 (under a high-end emission scenario). This could result in a substantial decrease in farm income by that date. Also farmland values are projected to decrease in parts of southern Europe by more than 80% by 2100, which could result in land abandonment. The trade patterns are also said to be impacted, in turn affecting agricultural income. Also, increased food demand worldwide could exert pressure on food prices in the coming decades.<ref>[https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/climate-change-threatens-future-of Climate change threatens

However, the vulnerability of the poor in developing countries to short-term impacts from climate change, notably the increased frequency and severity of adverse weather events is likely to have a negative impact. This, they say, should be taken into account when defining [[agricultural policy]].<ref name=\"ccandpoverty\">{{cite web |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1231&title=climate-change-agricultural-policy-poverty-reduction-much-know |title= Climate change, agricultural policy and poverty reduction \u2013 how much do we know? |year=2007 |publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Crop development models ===\n\nModels for climate behavior are frequently inconclusive. In order to further study effects of global warming on agriculture, other types of models, such as ''crop development models'', ''yield prediction'', quantities of ''water or fertilizer consumed'', can be used. Such models condense the knowledge accumulated of the climate, soil, and effects observed of the results of various [[agricultural practices]]. They thus could make it possible to test strategies of adaptation to modifications of the environment.\n\nBecause these models are necessarily simplifying natural conditions (often based on the assumption that weeds, disease and insect [[pest (animal)|pests]] are controlled), it is not clear whether the results they give will have an ''in-field'' reality. However, some results are partly validated with an increasing number of experimental results.\n\nOther models, such as ''insect and disease development'' models based on climate projections are also used (for example simulation of [[aphid]] reproduction or [[septoria]] (cereal fungal disease) development).\n\nScenarios are used in order to estimate climate changes effects on crop development and yield. Each scenario is defined as a set of [[meteorological]] variables, based on generally accepted projections.

Vietnam for example relies heavily on its southern tip, where the Mekong Delta lies, for rice planting.

[[Erosion]] and [[soil degradation]] is more likely to occur.  Soil [[fertility]] would also be affected by global warming. Increased erosion in agricultural landscapes from anthropogenic factors can occur with losses of up to 22% of soil carbon in 50 years.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Doetterl|first=Sebastian|last2=Oost|first2=Kristof Van|last3=Six|first3=Johan| name-list-format = vanc |date=2012-05-01|title=Towards constraining the magnitude of global agricultural sediment and soil organic carbon fluxes|journal=Earth Surface Processes and Landforms|language=en|volume=37|issue=6|pages=642\u2013655|doi=10.1002/esp.3198|issn=1096-9837|hdl=2078.1/123112|bibcode=2012ESPL...37..642D}}</ref> However, because the ratio of soil organic carbon to nitrogen is mediated by soil biology such that it maintains a narrow range, a doubling of soil organic carbon is likely to imply a doubling in the storage of [[nitrogen]] in soils as organic nitrogen, thus providing higher available nutrient levels for plants, supporting higher yield potential. The demand for imported fertilizer nitrogen could decrease, and provide the opportunity for changing costly [[fertilisation]] strategies.\n\nDue to the extremes of climate that would result, the increase in precipitations would probably result in greater risks of erosion, whilst at the same time providing soil with better hydration, according to the intensity of the rain. The possible evolution of the [[organic matter]] in the soil is a highly contested issue: while the increase in the temperature would induce a greater rate in the production of [[minerals]], lessening the [[soil organic matter]] content, the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration would tend to increase it.\n\n=== Potential effects of global climate change on pests, diseases and weeds ===\nA very important point to consider is that weeds would undergo the same acceleration of cycle as cultivated crops, and would also benefit from carbonaceous fertilization. Since most weeds are C3 plants, they are likely to compete even more than now against C4 crops such as corn. However, on the other hand, some results make it possible to think that [[weedkiller]]s could increase in effectiveness with the temperature increase.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Early Summer Weed Control|url=http://extension.unl.edu/statewide/sw3/6.17.15%20Early%20Summer%20Weed%20Control.pdf|journal=-}}</ref>\n\nGlobal warming would cause an increase in rainfall in some areas, which would lead to an increase of atmospheric humidity and the duration of the [[wet season]]s. Combined with higher temperatures, these could favour the development of [[fungi|fungal]] diseases. Similarly, because of higher temperatures and humidity, there could be an increased pressure from insects and [[Vector (epidemiology)|disease vectors]].\n\n=== Glacier retreat and disappearance ===\nThe continued [[Effects of global warming#Glacier retreat and disappearance|retreat of glaciers]] will have a number of different quantitative impacts. In the areas that are heavily dependent on [[Surface runoff|water runoff]] from [[glaciers]] that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff.

Crops that lie on the equatorial belt or under the tropical Walker circulation, such as rice, will be affected by varying monsoon patterns and more unpredictable weather. Scheduled planting and harvesting based on weather patterns will become less effective.\n\nAreas such as Indonesia where the main crop consists of rice will be more vulnerable to the increased intensity of ENSO effects in the future of climate change.

In this context, institutions and policies are important at multiple scales.\n\nTravis Lybbert and Daniel Sumner suggest six policy principles:<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lybbert |first1=Travis J. |last2=Sumner |first2=Daniel A. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Agricultural technologies for climate change in developing countries: Policy options for innovation and technology diffusion |journal=Food Policy |date=February 2012 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=114\u2013123 |doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2011.11.001 }}</ref>\n#The best policy and institutional responses will enhance information flows, incentives and flexibility.\n#Policies and institutions that promote economic development and reduce poverty will often improve agricultural adaptation and may also pave the way for more effective climate change mitigation through agriculture.\n#Business as usual among the world's poor is not adequate.\n#Existing technology options must be made more available and accessible without overlooking complementary capacity and investments.\n#Adaptation and mitigation in [[agriculture]] will require local responses, but effective policy responses must also reflect global impacts and inter-linkages.\n#[[Trade]] will play a critical role in both mitigation and adaptation, but will itself be shaped importantly by climate change.\n\nThe Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP)<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.worldscientific.com/page/pressroom/2015-03-10-02 |title=Food for the Future - Assessments of Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture |publisher=Imperial College Press |date=April 2015 |access-date=17 July 2019 }}</ref> was developed in 2010 to evaluate agricultural models and intercompare their ability to predict climate impacts. In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, South America and East Asia, AgMIP regional research teams (RRTs) are conducting integrated assessments to improve understanding of agricultural impacts of climate change (including biophysical and [[economic impacts of climate change|economic impacts]]) at national and regional scales. Other AgMIP initiatives include global gridded modeling, data and information technology (IT) tool development, simulation of crop pests and diseases, site-based crop-climate sensitivity studies, and aggregation and scaling.\n\nOne of the most important projects to mitigate climate change with agriculture and adapting agriculture to climate change at the same time, was launched in 2019 by the \"Global EverGreening Alliance\". The initiative was announced in the [[2019 UN Climate Action Summit]]. One of the main methods is [[Agroforestry]]. Another important method is [[Conservation farming]]. One of the targets is to sequester carbon from the atmosphere. By 2050 the restored land should sequestrate 20 billion of carbon annually. The coalition wants, among other, to recover with trees a territory of 5.75 million square kilometres, achieve a health tree - grass balance on a territory of 6.5 million square kilometres and increase carbon capture in a territory of 5 million square kilometres.\n\nThe first phase is the \"Grand African Savannah Green Up\" project. Already millions families implemented these methods, and the average territory covered with trees in the farms in [[Sahel]] increased to 16%.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoffner |first1=Erik |title=Grand African Savannah Green Up': Major $85 Million Project Announced to Scale up Agroforestry in Africa |url=https://www.ecowatch.com/agroforestry-africa-climate-summit-2641102482.html |accessdate=27 October 2019 |agency=Ecowatch |date=25 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Impact of agriculture on climate change ==\n{{update section|reason=it needs more recent info e.g. on plowing and soil|date=July 2019}}\n[[File:Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, by region, 1990-2010.png|thumb|right|upright=2|alt=refer to caption and image description|Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, by region, 1990-2010]]\nThe agricultural sector is a driving force in the gas emissions and land use effects thought to cause climate change.

Though these \"non-traditional\" hydrogen bonding interactions are often quite weak (~1 kcal/mol), they are also ubiquitous and are increasingly recognized as important control elements in receptor-ligand interactions in medicinal chemistry or intra-/intermolecular interactions in materials sciences.   The definition of hydrogen bonding has gradually broadened over time to include these weaker attractive interactions.  In 2011, an [[IUPAC]] Task Group recommended a modern evidence-based definition of hydrogen bonding, which was published in the [[IUPAC]] journal ''[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]''. This definition specifies:\n{{quote|The hydrogen bond is an attractive interaction between a hydrogen atom from a molecule or a molecular fragment X\u2013H in which X is more electronegative than H, and an atom or a group of atoms in the same or a different molecule, in which there is evidence of bond formation.<ref name=\"arunen2011\">{{cite journal|title = Definition of the hydrogen bond|journal = [[Pure Appl.

In a discrete water molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.  Two molecules of [[water]] can form a hydrogen bond between them that is to say [[oxygen-hydrogen bonding]]; the simplest case, when only two molecules are present, is called the [[water dimer]] and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the [[crystal structure]] of [[ice]], helping to create an open hexagonal lattice. The density of ice is less than the density of water at the same temperature; thus, the solid phase of water floats on the liquid, unlike most other substances.\n\n[[Liquid]] water's high [[boiling point]] is due to the high number of hydrogen bonds each molecule can form, relative to its low [[molecular mass]]. Owing to the difficulty of breaking these bonds, water has a very high boiling point, melting point, and viscosity compared to otherwise similar liquids not conjoined by hydrogen bonds. Water is unique because its oxygen atom has two lone pairs and two hydrogen atoms, meaning that the total number of bonds of a water molecule is up to four.\n\nThe number of hydrogen bonds formed by a molecule of liquid water fluctuates with time and temperature.<ref name=\"Jorgensen1985\"/>   From [[water model|TIP4P]] liquid water simulations at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, it was estimated that each water molecule participates in an average of 3.59 hydrogen bonds.

For example, the double helical structure of [[DNA]] is due largely to hydrogen bonding between its [[base pair]]s (as well as [[pi stacking]] interactions), which link one complementary strand to the other and enable [[DNA replication|replication]].\n\n===Proteins===\nIn the [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure of proteins]], hydrogen bonds form between the backbone oxygens and [[amide]] hydrogens.  When the spacing of the [[amino acid]] residues participating in a hydrogen bond occurs regularly between positions ''i'' and ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;4, an [[alpha helix]] is formed.  When the spacing is less, between positions ''i'' and ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;3, then a [[3 10 helix|3<sub>10</sub> helix]] is formed. When two strands are joined by hydrogen bonds involving alternating residues on each participating strand, a [[beta sheet]] is formed. Hydrogen bonds also play a part in forming the tertiary structure of protein through interaction of R-groups. (See also [[protein folding]]).\n\n[[Bifurcated H-bond]] systems are common in alpha-helical [[transmembrane proteins]] between the backbone amide C=O of residue ''i'' as the H-bond acceptor and two H-bond donors from residue ''i+4'': the backbone amide N-H and a side-chain hydroxyl or thiol H<sup>+</sup>. The energy preference of the bifurcated H-bond hydroxyl or thiol system is -3.4 kcal/mol or -2.6 kcal/mol, respectively. This type of bifurcated H-bond provides an intrahelical H-bonding partner for polar side-chains, such as [[serine]], [[threonine]], and [[cysteine]] within the hydrophobic membrane environments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Feldblum|first=Esther S.|author2=Arkin, Isaiah T.|title=Strength of a bifurcated H bond|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=11|pages=4085\u20134090|year=2014|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/02/26/1319827111|doi=10.1073/pnas.1319827111|pmid=24591597|pmc=3964065}}</ref>\n\nThe role of hydrogen bonds in protein folding has also been linked to osmolyte-induced protein stabilization. Protective osmolytes, such as [[trehalose]] and [[sorbitol]], shift the protein folding equilibrium toward the folded state, in a concentration dependent manner. While the prevalent explanation for osmolyte action relies on excluded volume effects that are entropic in nature, recent [[circular dichroism]] (CD) experiments have shown osmolyte to act through an enthalpic effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Politi|first=Regina|author2=Harries, Daniel|title=Enthalpically driven peptide stabilization by protective osmolytes|journal=ChemComm|year=2010|volume=46|pages=6449\u20136451|doi=10.1039/C0CC01763A|pmid=20657920|issue=35}}</ref> The molecular mechanism for their role in protein stabilization is still not well established, though several mechanisms have been proposed.

However, washing at high temperatures can permanently break the hydrogen bonds and a garment may permanently lose its shape.\n\n===Cellulose===\nHydrogen bonds are important in the structure of [[cellulose]] and derived polymers in its many different forms in nature, such as [[cotton]] and [[flax]].\n\n[[Image:Kevlar chemical structure.png|thumb|400px|Para-aramid structure]]\n[[Image:Cellulose strand.svg|thumb|right|260px|A strand of cellulose (conformation I<sub>&alpha;</sub>), showing the hydrogen bonds (dashed) within and between cellulose molecules]]\n\n===Synthetic polymers===\nMany [[polymer]]s are strengthened by hydrogen bonds within and between the chains. Among the [[synthetic polymer]]s, a well characterized example is [[nylon]], where hydrogen bonds occur in the [[repeat unit]] and play a major role in [[crystallization]] of the material. The bonds occur between [[carbonyl]] and [[amine]] groups in the [[amide]] repeat unit. They effectively link adjacent chains, which help reinforce the material. The effect is great in [[aramid]] [[fibre]], where hydrogen bonds stabilize the linear chains laterally. The chain axes are aligned along the fibre axis, making the fibres extremely stiff and strong.\n\nThe hydrogen-bond networks make both natural and synthetic polymers sensitive to [[humidity]] levels in the atmosphere because water molecules can diffuse into the surface and disrupt the network. Some polymers are more sensitive than others. Thus [[nylon]]s are more sensitive than [[aramid]]s, and [[nylon 6]] more sensitive than [[nylon-11]].\n\n==Symmetric hydrogen bond==\nA [[symmetric hydrogen bond]] is a special type of hydrogen bond in which the proton is spaced exactly halfway between two identical atoms. The strength of the bond to each of those atoms is equal. It is an example of a [[three-center four-electron bond]]. This type of bond is much stronger than a \"normal\" hydrogen bond. The effective bond order is 0.5, so its strength is comparable to a covalent bond. It is seen in ice at high pressure, and also in the solid phase of many anhydrous acids such as [[hydrofluoric acid]] and [[formic acid]] at high pressure. It is also seen in the [[bifluoride]] ion [F--H--F]<sup>\u2212</sup>.

Though these \"non-traditional\" hydrogen bonding interactions are often quite weak (~1 kcal/mol), they are also ubiquitous and are increasingly recognized as important control elements in receptor-ligand interactions in medicinal chemistry or intra-/intermolecular interactions in materials sciences.

In 2011, an [[IUPAC]] Task Group recommended a modern evidence-based definition of hydrogen bonding, which was published in the [[IUPAC]] journal ''[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]''. This definition specifies:\n{{quote|The hydrogen bond is an attractive interaction between a hydrogen atom from a molecule or a molecular fragment X\u2013H in which X is more electronegative than H, and an atom or a group of atoms in the same or a different molecule, in which there is evidence of bond formation.<ref name=\"arunen2011\">{{cite journal|title = Definition of the hydrogen bond|journal = [[Pure Appl.

Gray dashed lines indicate hydrogen bonds]]\n[[File:NIMGLO12.png|right|thumb|120px|Structure of [[nickel bis(dimethylglyoximate)]], which features two linear hydrogen-bonds.]]\n\n===Water===\nA ubiquitous example of a hydrogen bond is found between [[water]] molecules.  In a discrete water molecule, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.  Two molecules of [[water]] can form a hydrogen bond between them that is to say [[oxygen-hydrogen bonding]]; the simplest case, when only two molecules are present, is called the [[water dimer]] and is often used as a model system. When more molecules are present, as is the case with liquid water, more bonds are possible because the oxygen of one water molecule has two lone pairs of electrons, each of which can form a hydrogen bond with a hydrogen on another water molecule. This can repeat such that every water molecule is H-bonded with up to four other molecules, as shown in the figure (two through its two lone pairs, and two through its two hydrogen atoms). Hydrogen bonding strongly affects the [[crystal structure]] of [[ice]], helping to create an open hexagonal lattice. The density of ice is less than the density of water at the same temperature; thus, the solid phase of water floats on the liquid, unlike most other substances.\n\n[[Liquid]] water's high [[boiling point]] is due to the high number of hydrogen bonds each molecule can form, relative to its low [[molecular mass]]. Owing to the difficulty of breaking these bonds, water has a very high boiling point, melting point, and viscosity compared to otherwise similar liquids not conjoined by hydrogen bonds. Water is unique because its oxygen atom has two lone pairs and two hydrogen atoms, meaning that the total number of bonds of a water molecule is up to four.\n\nThe number of hydrogen bonds formed by a molecule of liquid water fluctuates with time and temperature.<ref name=\"Jorgensen1985\"/>   From [[water model|TIP4P]] liquid water simulations at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, it was estimated that each water molecule participates in an average of 3.59 hydrogen bonds. At 100&nbsp;\u00b0C, this number decreases to 3.24 due to the increased molecular motion and decreased density, while at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, the average number of hydrogen bonds increases to 3.69.<ref name=\"Jorgensen1985\">{{cite journal|author1=Jorgensen, W.

It is a crucial part of the uniqueness of water.\n\nBecause water may form hydrogen bonds with solute proton donors and acceptors, it may competitively inhibit the formation of solute intermolecular or intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Consequently, hydrogen bonds between or within solute molecules dissolved in water are almost always unfavorable relative to hydrogen bonds between water and the donors and acceptors for hydrogen bonds on those solutes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jencks, William |title= Hydrogen Bonding between Solutes in Aqueous Solution| journal=[[J.

For example, the double helical structure of [[DNA]] is due largely to hydrogen bonding between its [[base pair]]s (as well as [[pi stacking]] interactions), which link one complementary strand to the other and enable [[DNA replication|replication]].\n\n===Proteins===\nIn the [[Protein secondary structure|secondary structure of proteins]], hydrogen bonds form between the backbone oxygens and [[amide]] hydrogens.  When the spacing of the [[amino acid]] residues participating in a hydrogen bond occurs regularly between positions ''i'' and ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;4, an [[alpha helix]] is formed.  When the spacing is less, between positions ''i'' and ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;3, then a [[3 10 helix|3<sub>10</sub> helix]] is formed. When two strands are joined by hydrogen bonds involving alternating residues on each participating strand, a [[beta sheet]] is formed. Hydrogen bonds also play a part in forming the tertiary structure of protein through interaction of R-groups. (See also [[protein folding]]).\n\n[[Bifurcated H-bond]] systems are common in alpha-helical [[transmembrane proteins]] between the backbone amide C=O of residue ''i'' as the H-bond acceptor and two H-bond donors from residue ''i+4'': the backbone amide N-H and a side-chain hydroxyl or thiol H<sup>+</sup>. The energy preference of the bifurcated H-bond hydroxyl or thiol system is -3.4 kcal/mol or -2.6 kcal/mol, respectively. This type of bifurcated H-bond provides an intrahelical H-bonding partner for polar side-chains, such as [[serine]], [[threonine]], and [[cysteine]] within the hydrophobic membrane environments.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Feldblum|first=Esther S.|author2=Arkin, Isaiah T.|title=Strength of a bifurcated H bond|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=11|pages=4085\u20134090|year=2014|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/02/26/1319827111|doi=10.1073/pnas.1319827111|pmid=24591597|pmc=3964065}}</ref>\n\nThe role of hydrogen bonds in protein folding has also been linked to osmolyte-induced protein stabilization. Protective osmolytes, such as [[trehalose]] and [[sorbitol]], shift the protein folding equilibrium toward the folded state, in a concentration dependent manner.

However, washing at high temperatures can permanently break the hydrogen bonds and a garment may permanently lose its shape.\n\n===Cellulose===\nHydrogen bonds are important in the structure of [[cellulose]] and derived polymers in its many different forms in nature, such as [[cotton]] and [[flax]].\n\n[[Image:Kevlar chemical structure.png|thumb|400px|Para-aramid structure]]\n[[Image:Cellulose strand.svg|thumb|right|260px|A strand of cellulose (conformation I<sub>&alpha;</sub>), showing the hydrogen bonds (dashed) within and between cellulose molecules]]\n\n===Synthetic polymers===\nMany [[polymer]]s are strengthened by hydrogen bonds within and between the chains. Among the [[synthetic polymer]]s, a well characterized example is [[nylon]], where hydrogen bonds occur in the [[repeat unit]] and play a major role in [[crystallization]] of the material. The bonds occur between [[carbonyl]] and [[amine]] groups in the [[amide]] repeat unit. They effectively link adjacent chains, which help reinforce the material. The effect is great in [[aramid]] [[fibre]], where hydrogen bonds stabilize the linear chains laterally. The chain axes are aligned along the fibre axis, making the fibres extremely stiff and strong.\n\nThe hydrogen-bond networks make both natural and synthetic polymers sensitive to [[humidity]] levels in the atmosphere because water molecules can diffuse into the surface and disrupt the network. Some polymers are more sensitive than others. Thus [[nylon]]s are more sensitive than [[aramid]]s, and [[nylon 6]] more sensitive than [[nylon-11]].\n\n==Symmetric hydrogen bond==\nA [[symmetric hydrogen bond]] is a special type of hydrogen bond in which the proton is spaced exactly halfway between two identical atoms. The strength of the bond to each of those atoms is equal. It is an example of a [[three-center four-electron bond]]. This type of bond is much stronger than a \"normal\" hydrogen bond. The effective bond order is 0.5, so its strength is comparable to a covalent bond. It is seen in ice at high pressure, and also in the solid phase of many anhydrous acids such as [[hydrofluoric acid]] and [[formic acid]] at high pressure. It is also seen in the [[bifluoride]] ion [F--H--F]<sup>\u2212</sup>.

{"title_page": "Historicist interpretations of the Book of Revelation", "text_new": "{{Christian Eschatology}}\n[[Historicism (Christianity)|Historicism]], a method of interpretation in [[Christian eschatology]] which associates [[Bible prophecy|biblical prophecies]] with actual historical events and identifies symbolic beings with historical persons or societies, has been applied to the [[Book of Revelation]] by many writers. The Historicist view follows a straight line of continuous fulfillment of prophecy which starts in Daniel's time and goes through John's writing of the [[Book of Revelation]] all the way to the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Jesus Christ]].<ref>History of the Church of God, pp. 252, 253 (1876)</ref>\n\nOne of the most influential  aspects of the early [[Protestantism|Protestant]] historicist [[paradigm]] was the assertion that scriptural identifiers of the Antichrist were matched only by the institution of the Papacy. Particular significance and concern were the Papal claims of authority over both the Church, through Apostolic succession, and the State, through the Divine right of Kings. When the Papacy aspires to exercise authority beyond its religious realm into civil affairs, on account of the Papal claim to be the Vicar of Christ, then the institution was fulfilling the more perilous biblical indicators of the [[Antichrist]]. [[Martin Luther]] wrote this view, which was not novel, into the [[Smalcald Articles]] of 1537. It was then widely popularized in the 16th century, via sermons, drama, books, and [[broadside (printing)|broadside]] publication.<ref>{{cite book| first =Barbara Sher | last = Tinsley|title=History and Polemics in the French Reformation: Florimond de Raemond, Defender of the Church|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w1UcZhIXFAYC&pg=PA80 |date=1 January 1992|publisher=Susquehanna University Press|isbn= 978-0-945636-29-8|page= 80}}</ref>\nThe alternate methods of prophetic interpretation, [[Futurism (Christianity)|Futurism]] and [[Preterism]] were derived from Jesuit writings, whose counter reformation efforts were aimed at opposing this interpretation<ref>\"Jesuit scholarship rallied to the Roman cause by providing two plausible alternatives to the historical interpretation of the Protestants. 1. Luis de Alcazar (1554-1630) of Seville, Spain, devised what became known as the 'preterist' system of prophetic interpretation. This theory proposed that the Revelation deals with events in the Pagan Roman Empire, that antichrist refers to Nero and that the prophecies were therefore fulfilled long before the time of the medieval church. Alcazar's preterist system has never made any impact on the conservative, or evangelical wing of the Protestant movement, although in the last one hundred years it has become popular among Protestant rationalists and liberals. 2. A far more successful attack was taken by Francisco Ribera (1537\u20131591) of Salamanca, Spain. He was the founder of the 'futurist' system of prophetic interpretation. Instead of placing antichrist way in the past as did Alcazar, Ribera argues that antichrist would appear way in the future. About 1590 Ribera published a five hundred page commentary on the Apocalypse, denying the Protestant application of antichrist to the church of Rome.\" M.L.

Throughout most of history since the predictions of the book of Daniel, historicism has been widely used. This approach can be found in the works [[Josephus]] who interpreted the fourth kingdom of [[Daniel 2]] as the Roman empire with a future power as the stone \"not cut by human hands\", that would overthrow the Romans.<ref>Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews 10:10, in William Whiston, trans., The Works of Josephus: Complete and Unabridged (Peabody: Hendrickson, 1988), pages = 280; cf. Froom 1:199.</ref> We also find it in the early church in the works of Irenaeus (and Tertullian) who interpreted the fourth kingdom of Daniel as the Roman empire and believed that in the future it was going to be broken up into smaller kingdoms, as the iron mixed with clay.<ref>28Irenaeus, Against Heresies, book 5, chap. 26, in Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, eds., Ante-Nicene Fathers (Edinburgh: T & T Clark, 1885 [reprint 1989]), 1:554\u00d0555; cf.

Wycliffe himself tells (''Sermones'', III. 199) how he concluded that there was a great contrast between what the Church was and what it ought to be, and saw the necessity for reform. Along with John Hus, they had started the inclination toward ecclesiastical reforms of the Catholic Church.\n\nWhen the [[Swiss Reformation|Swiss Reformer]] [[Huldrych Zwingli]] became the pastor of the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]] in [[Zurich]] (1518) he began to preach ideas on reforming the Catholic Church. Zwingli, who was a Catholic priest before he became a Reformer, often referred to the Pope as the Antichrist. He wrote: \"I know that in it works the might and power of the Devil, that is, of the Antichrist\".<ref>''Principle Works of Zwingli'', Vol. 7, p. 135.</ref>\n\nThe [[English Reformation|English Reformer]] [[William Tyndale]] held that while the Roman Catholic realms of that age were the empire of Antichrist, any religious organization that distorted the doctrine of the Old and New Testaments also showed the work of Antichrist. In his treatise ''The Parable of the Wicked Mammon'', he expressly rejected the established Church teaching that looked to the future for an Antichrist to rise up, and he taught that Antichrist is a present spiritual force that will be with us until the end of the age under different religious disguises from time to time.<ref>Tyndale, William, ''Parable of the Wicked Mammon'', c. 1526, (facsimile copy of later printing, no ISBN number, Benediction Classics, 2008) at pages 4-5.</ref> Tyndale's translation of 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, concerning the \"Man of Lawlessness\" reflected his understanding, but was significantly amended by later revisers,<ref>\"Tyndale's Doctrine of Antichrist and His Translation of 2 Thessalonians 2\", R.

Particular significance and concern were the Papal claims of authority over both the Church, through Apostolic succession, and the State, through the Divine right of Kings. When the Papacy aspires to exercise authority beyond its religious realm into civil affairs, on account of the Papal claim to be the Vicar of Christ, then the institution was fulfilling the more perilous biblical indicators of the [[Antichrist]]. [[Martin Luther]] wrote this view, which was not novel, into the [[Smalcald Articles]] of 1537.

Luis de Alcazar (1554-1630) of Seville, Spain, devised what became known as the 'preterist' system of prophetic interpretation. This theory proposed that the Revelation deals with events in the Pagan Roman Empire, that antichrist refers to Nero and that the prophecies were therefore fulfilled long before the time of the medieval church. Alcazar's preterist system has never made any impact on the conservative, or evangelical wing of the Protestant movement, although in the last one hundred years it has become popular among Protestant rationalists and liberals. 2. A far more successful attack was taken by Francisco Ribera (1537\u20131591) of Salamanca, Spain. He was the founder of the 'futurist' system of prophetic interpretation. Instead of placing antichrist way in the past as did Alcazar, Ribera argues that antichrist would appear way in the future. About 1590 Ribera published a five hundred page commentary on the Apocalypse, denying the Protestant application of antichrist to the church of Rome.\" M.L.

Wycliffe himself tells (''Sermones'', III. 199) how he concluded that there was a great contrast between what the Church was and what it ought to be, and saw the necessity for reform. Along with John Hus, they had started the inclination toward ecclesiastical reforms of the Catholic Church.\n\nWhen the [[Swiss Reformation|Swiss Reformer]] [[Huldrych Zwingli]] became the pastor of the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]] in [[Zurich]] (1518) he began to preach ideas on reforming the Catholic Church. Zwingli, who was a Catholic priest before he became a Reformer, often referred to the Pope as the Antichrist. He wrote: \"I know that in it works the might and power of the Devil, that is, of the Antichrist\".<ref>''Principle Works of Zwingli'', Vol. 7, p. 135.</ref>\n\nThe [[English Reformation|English Reformer]] [[William Tyndale]] held that while the Roman Catholic realms of that age were the empire of Antichrist, any religious organization that distorted the doctrine of the Old and New Testaments also showed the work of Antichrist. In his treatise ''The Parable of the Wicked Mammon'', he expressly rejected the established Church teaching that looked to the future for an Antichrist to rise up, and he taught that Antichrist is a present spiritual force that will be with us until the end of the age under different religious disguises from time to time.<ref>Tyndale, William, ''Parable of the Wicked Mammon'', c. 1526, (facsimile copy of later printing, no ISBN number, Benediction Classics, 2008) at pages 4-5.</ref> Tyndale's translation of 2 Thessalonians, chapter 2, concerning the \"Man of Lawlessness\" reflected his understanding, but was significantly amended by later revisers,<ref>\"Tyndale's Doctrine of Antichrist and His Translation of 2 Thessalonians 2\", R.
